Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the owner of the yard hired by this Consulate has de.nanded an increase of the rent from Rials £00 to Rials 460 a month. S. This yard was originally rented by the public *orks Department of India for storing their materials and when they vacated it the Consulate continued to rent it as from 1th ..lay 1933 for Rials £00 a month under authority of Foreign Office despatch No. 464 (£ 9666/670/34) of 23rd August 1933 to you. This yard is still required for the purposes originally detailed. 3. as foreocat in Note 1 of the appendix to this office letter To.1022 of June 8th last, the landlord has demanded that the rent of the yarn be about doubled. After considerable dit'cuacion, he has agreed to accept a rental of Rials 300 per month. In view of the increase of the cost of living which has taken place in recent years which has caused a general increase in the level of rents, I consider that the increase of Rials 100 a month is reasonable. I therefore have the honour to re uest authority to pay this increased rental. 4. I have informed the landlord that I cannot increase the rent until I have sanction to do ao from the Foreign Office.

Will you please, therefore, instruct him by telegraph to proceed accordingly? The 10 year limit is important. It is equally important, from our point of view, that the site should be paid for this year. This does not mean, of course, that the money should be paid over without the title deeds and possession of the site being obtained, but I hope that you will impress upon the Minister the importance of getting the transaction completed at the earliest possible date. We don’t want to have to ask for a revote of £5,000, but unless we know with some certainty by (say) the 20th January that the money is to be paid this year, we shall be in a difficulty about the provision to be made in the 1938 Estimates.

No. 40562/3R00 of 21st Azar, 1316 ( 12th December, 1937). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Imperial Government, with reference to the semi-official correspondence exchanged between Mr. Butler, the Counsellor to His Majesty’s Legation, and Monsieur Massoud Ansarie, formerly Head of the Third Political Deuartment, concerning the plot of ground at Ahwaz, has the honour to state that the Ministry of Finance has communicated the following facts to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has asked for the views of His Majesty’s Legation in resnect of the carrying out of the transaction. 1. ••Vith regard to the fixing of the area of the ground and the price of same, as well as of the boundary of the water, it has been arranged, with the knowledge of the Governor, the Municipality and the Consulate, that the matter should be attended to and re-examined by the representatives of the Municipality, the Governor and the Finance Deoartment at Ahwaz in order that any differences may be settled. 2. As regards the piece of land to the width of 30 metres, adjacent to the river, which is considered by the Municipality as belonging to the town, by virtue of the regulations, and for which the Municipality expects to receive the price, it has been agreed that the said piece of ground may be included in the present transaction subject to the condition, however, that it may be re-purchased again from the Consulate at the presentpresent nrice whenever it is needed for the construction of a street. 3. With regard to the plot of ground of 10 metres, as at present the Municipality does not propose to do any building thereon it has been arranged that it should be handed over to the Consulate together with the rest of the property, on condition that no building should be erected thereon, except a wall, so that in case at some time in the future it is renuired for the ourpose of making a street it may be re purchased from the Consulate at the present price. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be glad to learn the views of His Majesty’s Legation on the matter at their earliest convenience.

Ho further o or,muni- oat ion has yet been reoei-eed from Bader. An early opportunity will be taken to ask him whether he is in a position to glYe the Iranian OoYemr.ent’s reply to the proposals made in the notes, a oopy of whioh was enclosed in ay despatch under reference. 2. V.'hile it is disappointing that it did not prove possible to persuade the looal authorities to abandon the proposed street aoress the site, I think that the oompwmis suggested by Mr. nardener is aooeptable, particularly since Place a time-limit of say ten years on the understanding not to build on the reserved atrip. I would suggest that I subjeot to a time-limit of ten years on the understanding It seems unlikely thus, the street will I oonour in I r. r-ardener's view that it is desirable to should now be authorised to aooept the compromise by Mr. Gardener, if it is confirmed by the r ranlan proposed / regarding The Right Honourable Anthony isden, M.C., Ms?., etc., etc#. etc.2 . regarding the reserved strip, and to proceed with the preparation of a contract for the purchase of the site accordingly, I am sending a copy of this despatch to Hia Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz, &gt;To. 58, I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant (Signed) ♦’SoytaoJirBRITISH COWSUTATR HO. 94 f 7&gt; y ^ 4HVA3, D 0 , f ( , . 4 th Hovembar 1937 \ 6ir # Ab I have had the honour to report In my telegrams Mom, 36 of 26th ultimo, 37 of 30th ultimo and 40 of the 3rd instant, I have been in negotiation with the local authorities regarding the purchase of the Consular site in Ahwaz, authorities called for a further report were (a) the feasibility of the purchase by Hie Majesty’s Government of the strip alongside the river known as the M Harim~i-fhi&amp;khaneh rt on the terms suggested in the final sentence of paragraph 11 of my despatch Ho. 73 of June 16th, (b) to explain the difference in the area as formerly stated and as finally shown in the plan recently communicated to the Iranian Government and finally (c) to ascertain whether the road planned to cross area a/2 is really necessary. 3.

This suggestion was adopted by the Acting Governor General on behalf of the Municipality and by the director of Finance and has, I expect, been telegraphed to their respective Ministries in Tehran. 6. As stated in my telegram, I did not suggest to the authorities here that a time limit should be placed on the understanding regarding redemption. If I had done eo, the negotiations here would have broken down. I venture to suggest however for your considera tion that a time limit of say five or ten years has Certain advantages - the chief being that after its expiry we can, if necessary fully exploit the road strip knowing that if it is subsequently expropriated we can claim full compensation. 7. Although the compromise now proposed is not as favourable to us as it might have been, I think it unlikely that a road across Area a will be required in the near future as the only interest to be served is the school which is already served by a twelve metre road. Further wore the Municipality has better use for its money than in the construction of a rond which is only of secondary importance. The restriction on the us© of the road alignment, although unfortunate will not, as far as I can see, bo a great inconvenience. vs I see it, there is room in area a/B for the construction of the Consular /residence4 residence near the figures *13604.0* on the plan, while the office can be built somewhere near the site marked 'foundations area 219.£' at the angle where the reserved strip touched the main road* I have the honour to be* Bir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Sd.)

Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 303 (K 9109/1403/234) of the 11th August, I have the honour to inform you that it has not yet been possible to fix definitely the limits of the land to be acquired by His Majesty’s Government for the site of His Majesty’s Consulate at Ahwaz. an ti c ipated in paragraoh 5 of my despatch No. 191 of the 21st May, His Majesty’s Consul met the local Director of Finance and another official representing the Governor- General and the Municipality on the 22nd May to fix the limits of the proposed site. Two difficulties quickly arose. First, the Director of Finance,said that a strip, known as '’harim-i-rudkhaneh” must be left along the river bank as the property of the Government, since the Government had fore shore rights along all the rivers. The appears tob e great uncertainty both about the oroper width of this strip, and the point from which it should be measured. But it seems that the width is in the neighbourhood of thirty metres. The local authorities wish to retain this strio ostensibly for the construction of road along the river bank. There would be no objection to this, if it were certain that the road would be made immediately. But the strip might well remain unused for a long time, and if open to the public would inevitably become a place of resort for most undesirable ourposes. Alternatively it/ he Right Honourable, Anthony Eden, M.C. ,M. P. , etc. , etc. , etc. , The Foreign Office, 3.W.1. —pit seems ■oossi'ble that the strip would not be used for a road at all but for building, perhaps for additions to the neighbouring school (No strip was retained in the case of the school itself or of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company No. 1 Bungalow) 3. I have considered two courses for meeting this threat to the amenities of the river frontage of the site which are obviously an inwortant matter): either to propose that His Majesty’s Government should now acquire the whole site down to the water, butleaving to the Iranian Government a right to repurchase a river side strip of given width for the purpose of a road, if and when they intend to construct it: or to leave the strip to the Iranian Government, but obtain clauses in the deed of sale precluding building on the strip, and permitting His Majesty’s Government to exclude the public by fencing it off pending development as a road. And I have reached the view that it would be better tactics to put '• forward the first now and keep the second in reserve. 4. The second difficulty was that the local authorities wished to build a ten metre road dividing Areas A and B, and encroaching considerably on Area A. The purpose of this road would be to link the school with the road running along the front of the consulate site. It would clearly be most unfortunate if this road were made cutting right across the site. Mr. Gardener made strenuous efforts to persuade the Governor- General to reverse the decision to make it. Unfortunately the Governor-General was transferred just as it appeared that a solution might be found. The Acting Governor-General agreed that the road was unnecessary, but did not feel able to do more than report his opinion to Tehran and ask for instructions. Mr. Gardener could do no more locally, and he therefore arranged/arranged for the site to be surveyed on the 17th June by the senior Indian surveyor emoloyed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. 5. The preparation of the plan of the site was delayed by more urgent work, and it was not received in His Ma f jesty T s Legation until the end of July. I have the honour to transmit under separate cover two conies of the plan, one of which is on tracing paper, from which further copies can be made. Though the areas are given in square metres, the scale is one inch to fifty feet. The line dividing Area A into A and A is 1 2 the limit of floods, and was indicated on the snot by the representatives of the Finance Department. This official stated that the harim -i- rudkhaneh should be measured from the limit of water at the time of survey (an easy but rather arbitrary decision) The hachured line represents the actual bank. It will be seen that an accurate survey has been made, the areas of the various nortions of the site have been found to differ from those given by the Iranian Government, as reported in my despatch No. 191 of the 21st May. A statement of the correct areas, with the price at the rates mentioned by Monsieur Bader, is incornorated in the notes drawn up for the information of Monsieur Bader, a copy of which I have the honour to enclose. 6. Since it was evident that nothing more could be achieved locally, I requested the Oriental Secretary at this Legation to call again on Monsieur Bader and invite his assistance in obtaining a satisfactory settlement of the difficulties over the river side strip and the proposed road across the site. Mr. Finch saw Monsieur Bader on the 16th September, and handed to him a copy of the enclosed notes. With regard to the river side strip, Monsieur Bader said that he thought that the prooosal in paragraph 11 would be feasible. He added that if it were adooted the Municipality would only have/have the right to buy back the strip for a road and not for a building. Monsieur Bader also expressed his personal agreement as to the non-necessity of the road separating A from B. He promised to consider the matter and to inform me of his decision as soon as possible. I now await his answer. 7. I should add, to complete my report of the negotiations to date, that I have been informed by the Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran that the Bank hold a mortgage from the heirs of the late Ha.ji Moin at Tujjar on about 26,000 square metres of the total area.. The Bank are satisfied that the heirs 1 title is valid. The Bank have, however, no objection to the sale of the mortgaged land to His Majesty’s Government by the Iranian Government. It seems, however, clearly desirable, when drawing up the contract for the sale, to insert a clause indemnifying His Majesty’s Government from any third party claims. This is quite a normal procedure in land transactions in this country. In this case the proposal for such a clause need not be supported by any reference to the claim of the heirs of the late Moin at Tuffar. It would be sufficient to represent it as a formal and customary precaution in view of the fact that the property has not been registered with the Registration Department. 8. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz No. 47. * I have etc. (Signed) H. J. Seymour.1. Attached is a survey plan, to the scale of 1 inch - 50 feet, of the oronosed site of the British Consulate, Ahwaz, showing the sections which have 'been referred to as '’A' 1 , “B' and 'C”. 2. It is requested that the olan he eventually returned. 3. The area 'A” is divided into two sections, marked A 1 and A. The line dividing them is the limit of the ground 2 liable to flood from the River Karun, and was indicated on the soot by a representative of the Finance Department at Ahwaz. 4. H.E.Monsieur Bader mentioned the following figures in conversation with Mr. Finch on May 11th last:- 11,115 square metres @ Rls 10 - Rls 111,150 17,955 ,f M ' ' 15 - 269,325 4,450 ’* ” ’* ” 17 - 75,650 1,500 ' ' ” ” 5 - 7,500 35,020 tt ' ,t . Rls 463,625 Now that the ground has been accurately surveyed, it will be seen that the areas, with their prices at the rates quoted, should be as follows:- A •• 14,897.2 square metres © Rls 10 - Rls 148,972 1 A .. 13,604 2 B .. 4,685 C .. 1,501.3 34,687.5 @ ' 15 @ 17 @ ” 5 204,060 79,645 7,506.5 Rls 440,183.5 5. H.M. Consul at Ahwaz reports that matters have come to a standstill over the following difficulties:- d) 6. The Imperial Government wish to retain a strip along the river front for a future roadway. 7. The hachured line on the attached plan shows the river bank, and the line marked ’’Limit of Water” represents the water level at the time of survey. The agent of the Finance Department/Department stated that this latter should be taken as the datum level from which the strip should be measured. There is, however, doubt about the width of the strip. The local Finance Department has mentioned 30 metres, but there seems uncertainty on this point, which should be cleared up* 8. In any case, a strip of 30 metres would cut out into area A, whose extent and price would have to be corresoondingly 1 reduced. 9. Until the road is actually made, which may not be for some time, the river front will remain an undeveloped but accessible public place, which is likely to be a receptacle for rubbish, and to be otherwise undesirable. 10. His Majesty's Government naturally desire that the frontage in the direction of the river should be an addition to the amenities of the site, not a detraction therefrom. 11. Would it not, therefore, be possible for the whole plot of ground, right down to the river, to be sold now to His Majesty's Government, leaving, if necessary, a clause in the contract whereby the Imperial Government would have the right to repurchase a strip of specified width for the construction of a road, if and when that project is taken in hand? 12. It is to be noted that no such strip of river front was reserved in the case of the school next door, or in the case of No. 1 Bungalow on the other side. (n) 13. The Governor-General, Ahwaz, states that it is proposed to construct a 10-metre road at the -olace shown by dotted pencil lines on the attached plan. 14. The space subtracted from A by this orojected road 2 would be approximately 925 square metres, which would therefore have to be deducted from the price (about Rials 13,875 at the rate k quoted/quoted) 15. His Majesty’s Government have the following objections to offer to this proposal:- (a) It is inconsistent with the offer already made by the Imperial Government, in which the figures (now corrected by survey) were 35,020 square metres of land for Rials 436,625, since, as explained above, and evident from the nlan, the roadway in question would have to be subtracted from the area, and would thus diminish the space available for the consulate buildings &amp;c. (b It would cut the site offered to His Majesty’s Government into two, and thus immensely impair its general total value. (c) It is unnecessary. The object of the road in question would be to link the School with the main road. Not only is the School already linked with the main road by a direct 12-metre road (which may be seen on the attached plan), but it is proposed, in addition, to build another road (shaded in pencil on the plan) running round the edge of ”B” by its northern angle; so that the pronosed road shaded in -oencil is scarcely necessary, while yet a third road, shown by the dotted lines, would be quite superfluous. (d)The local authorities are believed to base the project upon a municinal clan made a number of years ago. It was understood that this plan had been superseded, and the projected road abandoned in view of the fact the His Majesty’s Government have lost 219.2 square metres of foundations constructed by them in the past, owing to the subsequent building of a road round the Bagh-i-Melli/Bagh-i-Melli (see attached survey). (e) Until the road in question was made, the space left for it would form an enclave, objectionable for reasons similar to those given in the case of the river front in paragraph 9 above, right across the property to be acquired by His Majesty’s Government. It is therefore earnestly hoped that this project of a road will be abandoned(K 7177/1403/334) R 7 i 0 -V '7 OPPIC &lt;, S.V-'.l. 25th June, 1937. Sir, Vith reference to Mr. Muir’s letter D.C.1/7239 of the 8th June regarding the consular site at Ahwaz, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit herewith, to be laid before the Pirst Commissioner of His Majesty’s ’ orks and Public Buildings, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran reporting that the Iranian Government have now agreed to sell the site. 2. In view of the importance of securing the land, Mr. Eden earnestly hopes that provisional arrangements.can be made for the purchase of the whole area at an aggregate price of 463,625 Rials, as soon as the exact boundaries of the site have been delimited. ft I a m, e t c. , i (Sgd) D.J.

Sir, Tith reference to my telegram No.61 of to-day, I have the honour to t ransmit to you herewith copies of a letter No.5743/467 of the 25th April last from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Counsellor, of Mr. Butler’s reply of the 29th April, and of a further letter No.7015/642 of the 11th May from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning the sale of a plot of land for a Consulate at Ahwaz. 2. It will he seen that the Iranian G-overnment have at last agreed to sell land to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom on the site which has formed the subject of lengthy discussions, and that two stipulations are made; firstly that the building regulations of the Municipality are complied with, and secondly, that ’'the Consulate does not make any further request”, a phrase wnich has been orally explained by an official of the Ministry of foreign Affairs to mean that the site offered is considered adequate for a Consulate and that no further requests for the acquisition of land should be made. 3. Only the aggrfigate price of Rials 463,625 has been named, but in order to obtain the information requested in your telegram No.20 of the 9th February last as to the amount and limits of the land included in the offer, and the details as to the respective values placed upon sites, A, B and C, the Acting Minister of Finance has been interviewed t&gt;y/ The Right Honourable, Anthony Lden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., Foreign Office'by a member of my staff, and the following particulars were elicited:- The area offered for sale consists of (a) 17,955 square metres at Rials 15 - Rials 269,325 (b) ll,115 ' ' ' ’» 10 - ' 111,150 (c) 4,450 ' ' ' ” 17 - ' 75,650 (d) 1,500 ” u ” 5 - ” 7,500 35,020 square metres Rials 463,625 This works out at an average price of Rials 13.238 per square metre, and represents in an amplified form the informa tion which was conveyed to you in my telegram No.16 of the 3rd February last. 4. The Acting Minister of Finance was informed that it had been hoped that the price of the land would be in the neighbourhood of rials 12 per square metre but that the first essential information we required was how the various areas given above compared with the sections A, B and C of the site in plan previously submitted to him. He was also acquainted with our desire that the exact boundaries of the site should be marked out on the ground. Monsieur Bader accordingly agreed to telegraph instructions to his representa tive in Ahwaz to collaborate with His Majesty’s Consul in furnishing the necessary particulars and in fixing the bound aries, and similar instructions were communicated by me to Mr. Gardener. 5. His Majesty’s Consul has now telegraphed to me that a commission of representatives of the Governor-General, Finance Department and Municipality is to meet him on the site on May 22nd to delimit the site. Meanwhile the Municipal Engineer has stated unofficially to a representative of the Consulate/Consulate that area (a) in paragraph 3 above represents the portion furthest from the river of A, and (b) the portion nearest to the river, while (c) represents B, and (d) represents a portion of C on the side furthest from the river. A strip of land about 30 metres wide on the whole river front age (i.e. the thirty metres nearest the river of the original A and C of our plan) is not included in the offer, as it is being reserved as Government land for the construc tion of a future roadway. I understand also from previous correspondence with His Majesty’s Consul that a portion of C adjoining the school that lies by the northernmost corner of the original site has been encroached upon by the school. The remainder of C which is now for sale is therefore likely to consist mainly of the narrow wedge separating the Eastern part of the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s derelict wall from the plot B, though it may extend past the wall of the Moraggar Pumping Station lying to the North-west of B. This should be clarified when the Commission has completed its task. 6. Mr. Gardener has asked my authority for the erection at a small cost of boundary pillars, and for the survey of the site immediately afterwards by an engineer of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which would enable us to fix the boundaries in relation to the Company’s No.l Bungalow, and to check the accuracy of the areas given. It is hoped that no charge will be made for the survey but, in view of its importance in the interests of His Majesty’s Government, whether charged for or not, I have authorised Mr. Gardener to proceed with these projects, the result of which I will in due course communicate to you. 7. The Iranian Government evidently expect that we shall purchase the whole site, whicn in the main means that we shall/4 m mim — shell acquire B as well as A, since C is really a corridor, unimportant except for linking the two other portions and in any case its area and price form only a small portion of the whole. The total price of rials 463,625 which at the present rate of exchange equals about £5,795, is higher than that estimated in Mr. Butler’s despatch No.225 of May 2nd 1936. The previous calculation was based unon only a rough survey of the area and a price of rials 12 per square zar (1.02 metres). This was thought to be a suitable flat rate at that time but values have since risen in Ahwaz and His Majesty’s Consul informed me last January that the market price of B and the upper part of A was in the neighbourhood of Rials 30 per metre. He also informed me that if we did not take B or C, he understood that the price of A would be raised accordingly. As a matter of principle the Ministry of finance was reminded of the previously mentioned price of rials 12 (which was the price originally asked by Haji Muin- ut-Tujjar) but I consider, in view of Mr. Gardener’s informa tion, that the present price is not an unfair one. 6. Sir Reginald Hoare has already conveyed to you in his despatc i No.4-12 of 24/9/32 the arguments concerning amenities and constructional advantages that favour the inclusion of 3 and I now feel quite as strongly convinced, in spite of the rise in price and the fact that B is pro rata the most expensive (and therefore, in a sense, the most valuable) oortion of the site, that we should be very ill- advised to lose the present opportunity of acquiring the whole area in question especially in view the possibly enhanced price for A alone and the second stipulation of the Iranian Government recorded in paragranh 2 above. I have asked His Ms jesty’s/ HHH!-:9 j-sty f s 'JonBul f s opinion as to whether he considers necessary the acquisition of more of section G than the small wedge needed to link A v T ith B, hut I very much hope that, wit; this possible reservation, it will he found suitable to obtain sanction for the purchase of the whole of the site now offered by the Iranian Government. 9.

Dear Department, Enclosed is a copy of a letter No. 768 that we have received from Ahwaz, together with a copy of the useful plan of a portion of the proposed consular site that came with it. This will form a sort of postscript to our despatch No.191 of the 21st May and, besides showing you how things are progressing, its possession by you should, as Ahwaz suggest, further reduce telegraphy. 2. In the interval between the sending of my despatch No.191 and the receipt of the enclosed, we have learnt from Ahwaz that (a) a previous proposal to construct a road between A and B has been revived, and (b) A Government inspecting commission has arrived in Ahwaz, and the authorities have asked for a few days’ postponement of the boundary-fixing operations. The Ahwaz Consulate think they can probaoly dispose of the hitch over (a) by local not' arrangement. It certainly does seem as if the authorities A need a road between A and B if they have the one shaded in red on the enclosed plan, because this latter leads (off the left hand side of the plan) into another at right angles which communicates via the North East boundary of B with the main road. The hitch is typical of the way things happen here, but we hope soon to hear from Ahwaz that it has been settled. The Consular Department, Foreign Office. We/3. We agree with the arguments in favour of acquiring the triangle AXf that represents the relics of C. The Ministry of Finance offered us 1500 square metres of land at Rials 5 which was thought to represent C. Either (a) tnis included by mistake the portion that has already been occupied by the school, or (b) some of those 1500 square metres are to be found elsewhere on the site. Only the fixing of boundaries and the suggested survey by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company will finally reveal the answer to these conundrums. Yours ever, CHANCERY.COPY No. British Consulate, Ahvaz, 24tn May, 1937. Dear Chancery, I have tried to push the Iranian Authorities to show me the boundaries, on the ground of our land. They have all showed good will (and indeed anxiety to help) but we have come up against two obstacles (a) the delimitation of the 'harim-i-Rudkhaneh' - Government rights on the foreshore of the Karun and (b) modifications in the area of 'C'. In regard to the foreshore rights, Government has apparently a right of ownership over s trip thirty metres wide adjoining the river. This was allowed for (as far as I can see) when we built the wall. The river has now worn away some of our land and so the boundary has advanced. Further more the authorities seem uncertain whether the foreshore strip should be exactly parallel to all the windings of the river or a more or less straight line. In regard to area 'C”, I enclose a plan, which has no claim to be in any way accurate or to scale* It will however serve to convey the general idea. As far as I can see area 'C' never advanced to such a point as to cut off communication between 'A” and M B'. Old area 'C' as I have been shown it on the ground is something like the triangle A.B.C. and had an area of approximately/ The Chancery, British Legation, Tehranapproximately 1500 So. Metres. This area has now been reduced because the school has been continued further than intended towards area 'A'. A ten metre road (shown in red shading) is to be built skirting the school, the wall of 'A', turning in the angle of Area 'A”and 'B'. Thus area 'C” is now to be reduced to the triangle A.X.Y. This I estimate to be a half or even less of the area of the old ’’C'. In my letter of 7th December to Captain Howard Jones, sent through the Chancery (my No. 1581) but copy of the relevant paragraph enclosed for reference I expressed the opinion that we did not need old 'C'. This opinion was arrived at because of (l) the cost (2) I was then informed that the Education Department intended to acquire the land for a garden and finally because the area involved was large enough to attract a buyer of the right class and not a noisy teashop or hotel proprietor. Now the problem has changed. The area involved (and therefore presumably the cost) has been reduced; the attraction to a decent buyer has disappeared and the Education Department has assumed we V'-ere going to buy and has therefore made no plans for new' 'C'. I have explained to the Governor and the others that we do not want new 'C' and that our only purpose in buying would be on account of its 'nuisance value'. I pointed out that the 'nuisance' would be greater for them than for us since the school was nearer. To my arguments, the Governor General has given sympathetic hearing and has asked for a few days grace to consider the matter.■i If he agrees to buy it in for the Education Department, well and good. If not I'm in favour of acquiring it ourselves. The cost will not he more than 700 sq. metres @ 5 Krans i.e. £45 and it may prevent a great deal of heart burning in the future. I am pusning a decision as soon as possible but meanwhile this letter may save a lot of money in telegrams. Yours ever,Extract from a letter No.D.0.1579, dated 7th December 1936, from A.J.

Now the school shown in the enclosed plan (the accuracy of which I cannot guarantee) has been doubled in size and has come so close to 'C” that the education authorities will themselves, I think, prevent any unpleasant tenancy of 'C'. xxx x x x - A9) panCC PY (K 9109/1403/234) D.C.1/7239.

I have the honour to inform you that the proprietor of the stables used by the escort of this Consulate has given me written notice to vacate the premises by 21st March next failing which he states that the rental will be raised from the present figure of 250 rials a month to 750 rials. 2. The premises in question have been occupied by this Consulate for a period of some thirty years. The original rent was rials 125 a month raised to rials 250 from May 1929. It is undoubted that the latter figure does not represent the nresent day market figure. 3. If the premises are vacated, it is undoubted that a rental of some 500 to 600 rials a month will be demanded Furthermore the charges for coolie hire, erection of sheds for the horses and other miscellaneous expenditure incurred on account of the change of premises will probably amount to 2000 rials. 4. in these circumstances, I am treating with the landlord with a view to discovering the minimum figure at which he will qllow us to continue our occupancy of the premises. As I have already pointed out, this solution is probably the better one from the financial aspect. In addition it would now seem possible that the perennial question of a Consular residence here may be settled reasonably soon.Copy of a memorandum No.F.55-A/37, dated the 9th April 1937, from the Under Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, to the Hon*ble the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* Increase in the rental for the Ahwaz Consulate stables.

Legation Te hr an 2nd May, 1936 Sir With reference to my despatch No, 192 of the 18th April, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz regarding the market value of the land which His Majesty’s Government y/ish to acquire in that town. the 30th March 1933, Monsieur Sayyah of the Ministry of Finance informed the Oriental Secretary to this Legation orally that the Ministry of Finance were ready to fix the price of the land at 12^ rials per square zar. It does not follow that they will accept this figure now, since they may argue that the developments which have since 'been carried through at Ahwaz have increased the value of land there. Mr. Watkinson, however, considers that the market value of the whole site is at the outside not more than 15 rials per square zar. His Majesty’s Government have the right to expect, in viev/ of their own generous attitude with regard to the sale of the Legation land in Tehran, that they should be able to buy this land from i the Iranian Government at less than the ruling market price. I would therefore suggest that I be authorised to offer 12 rials per square zar. areas ”B” and W C” as well as ”A”. The arguments in favour of acquiring areas ”B” and n C* have been repeatedly 2 It is true that, as Mr . Watkinson observes, on 3 I would also venture to request authority to buy advanced The Right Honourable ‘Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P etc., etc., etc. Foreign Office.advanced in correspondence with your Department (see in particular Sir Reginald Hoare’s despatch No. 412 of the 24th September 1932). There is no need for me to recapitulate them here at length. I would only remind you that nearly half of this apparently large area is liable to flooding and useless for building; that in the noisome climate of Ahwaz a much larger area of garden and greenery is required to keep at bay dust and smells; that the acquisition of Area renders possible the construction on a single site of offices, garage, stables and godowns, and also of a Vice-Consul’s residence, which may well be required in the future (see Sir Reginald Hoare’s despatch No. 4 of the 9th January 1934) particularly if the post is raised to a Consulate-General; and finally that by acquiring areas W B M and ’’C 1 ’, the very important advantage will be gained of ensuring that the Consulate will be bounded by roads except where it marches with 'No. 1 Bungalow' and will therefore be secure against undesirable neighbours, if area 'B' were built upon by others or, if it were not, against the unsanitary conditions which prevail on any open space in a Persian town. 4. I am impressed by the unanimity of the opinion held by successive Consuls at Ahwaz and Ministers at this post, that it would be false economy not to acquire areas 'B' and ”C', and I am fortified in my view that these areas should be purchased by the knowledge that it is strongly held by His Majesty’s Minister, who is personally acquainted with the site (see his telegram No. 87 of the 14th March 1935) and by the fact that their acquisition by exchange was authorised in Sir John Simon’s telegram No.90 of the 3rd April 1935, which showed that the advantages of obtaining them are fully appreciated by your Department. 5. The area of 'A' is 27,100 square zars and that of 'B''B' and 'C' together 6,524 square zars, making a total of 33,624 square zars. At 12 rials per zsr the cost of area 'A M will be Rials 325,200 (at 80 rials to the pound sterling, £4065), while the additional cost of areas and 'C' will be Rials 78,288 or £978,12.0., making a total cost of £5043.12,0, As Mr. Watkinson observes, it is important t to erect a wall and plant trees as soon as possible. I would therefore venture to suggest that authorisation should be obtained for the acquisition of the whole area M A M , ”8” &amp; M C* at a price of 12 rials per zar, and that at the same time further expenditure on a wall and the planting of trees should be authorised up to a total limit of £5,500 (which would appear to be the necessary sum, rather than £4000 as stated by Mr. V/atkinson). 6.

Rls. 12^ Sir, Vi/ith reference to your telegram No. 16, of April 18, 1936, containing the most v/elcome news that the Iranian Government now agrees to cede land for building Consular premises in Ahwaz, I have the honour to inform you that the value of the land known as the 'Sheikas site” was agreed by the Ministry of Finance in the year 1933 to be twelve v and a half rials per square zar f , as reported in the Memorandum dated April 7, 1933, forwarded to the Foreign Office together with your despatch No. 160. This price was fixed in view of the fact that nearly half of ”Area A” and ’’Area C H are liable to floods and therefore useless for building without the expenditure of a very considerable sum on a river embankment. 2. I find on reference to the files that my predecessor estimated the value of Area A to be fifteen rials per square zar f . This was based on division into four zones, of v/hich the two nearest to the river were worth five rials, the next one twenty rials and the best part thirty rials. Part of the last mentioned land was subsequently expropriated by the Baladiyeh His Britannic Majesty^ Chargd d f Affaires, British Legation, Rls.15. Rls. 5. Rls. 20. Rls. 30. Te hranBaladiyeh and is now a public road. When discussions took place in Tehran with the late Hadji Mu 1 in the purchase price was fixed at twelve rials (see your telegram No. 412 to the Foreign Office of September 24, 1932) and this was confirmed in 1934 by the heirs of Hadji Mu*in (see your telegram No. 25 of March 6, 1934 to the Foreign Office). 3. Since then transfers of land in the immediate neighbourhood of the 'Sheikh’s site' have been effected at thirty rials per square zar’, and I think that the value of that part of the land situated furthest from the river is the same and that the lower portion is still worth five rials as estimated before. In any case not more than fifteen rials per square zar* for the whole area should be paid. 4. If the Treasury will sanction ear-marking of four thousand pounds for immediate expenditure, this would cover acquisition of land, the building of a proper wall to exclude the public from it, and the planting of a few trees, both of which I consider should be put in hand with the least possible delay even if no further building is feasible for the present. 5. The arguments in favour of including 'Area B' in the site still appear to me to have the same force as before. Should it eventually be decided not to build offices, stables, garage and dependencies on that part of the land, it could probably be disposed of for at least its present purchase price.

Dear Scott, Oui old friend Ahwaz. If you really think that we are at long last in sight of land, I wish you would let me know exactly what buildings you are going to ask us to erect on this site as the question of the area to be acquired obviously depends on uhe proposed layout. As it is some years since we talked about the proposed buildings it would be well, I suggest, to look into the question again. Generally speaking we ai e still inclined, to think here that site A. &gt; approximately 7^5 acres should be sufficient for your purpose, but we should like to have a definite schedule of requirements from you before going any further with the proposed layout. I don’t suppose for a moment that even if all went well we should be in a position to complete the negotiations for the purchase until next financial year so that we have plenty of time in which to consider the question from all aspects. Yours sincerely, (Signed) E. de Normann. David Scott, Esq., Foreign Office, S. W. 1.Dear Watkinson, The other day we heard from de Nermann of the Office of Works saying that he wishes to look again into the question of the Ahwaz Consular site and buildings. I have rung him up and find that he has gone on leave and will not be back until the 28th August, but if you are in this country then I think it would be a very good thing if you went and saw him. Will you let me know if you will be able to do so. Yours ever, (Sd.) DAVID SCOTT. Will you reply to Roberts as I am off on leave in a few days. A.E.Watkinson, Esq.c/o Lloyds Ba: 6, Pall Mall.

Dear Roberts, Please refer to Scott’s letter, K 7952/207/234, of August 4 regarding Ahwaz Consular site and building. am at de Normann’s disposal in the meanwhile if he wants any information, though the matter hardly seems to concern me now. I can only repeat, as I have done for the past three years, that action must be taken as early as possible by the Office of Works. The Legation gave me to understand early this year that no further difficulty existed at their end. I shall be in and out of Town from September 10 onwards and Yours ever, (Signed) A.S.WATKINSON.

Dear Bcott, r lea8e refer to Allchin’s note (K 10936/10936/234&gt; of October 13 about Ahwaz consulate site. I saw Muir and Howard Jones at the Office of tforks yesterday. They asked me to mention to you the urgency of replying to their questions of July 10» as the time is approaching when estimates must be put in. although it is decided in principle to buy the land, they insist on full information as to the proposed buildings before proceeding further. The supplementary estimate promised for purchase of the land whenever it became available seems to have been forgotten. I gave Muir and Howard Jones my opinion more or less as follows. The latter seemed to understand and to agree with everything I said, but Muir wants something from you. tre shall require a Consulate residence: offices (the present building has seven rooms for staff of four clerks, messengers A archives, etc.): storage go-downs for camp equipment, saddlery etc. which also serve as a residence for the menial staff &amp; watchmen: stabling accommodation for three horses with accommodation for three grooms at present paid for by the Government of India: garage. If the Government of India establishment in the Gulf is withdrawn from Iran, presumably escort and mounts will have to be taK.en over. Kven should any change occur as uetween Ahwaz and horramahaler if ana when the Political Aesident withdraws, aa career Vice-Consul will hav^ to be maintained at Ahwaz and similar accommodation will be required. It is absurd to talk of 3ite A being approximately acres. Howard Jones himself stated that Site B should certainly be taken in, for half of Site A is flooded every year and is useless for builaing or for garden planning other than trees, and the prevailing wind in summer is north so that any further building in on that side would make Site A hotter and less healthy. The go-downs, stables A other dependencies and possibry the Office, could be put there, leaving the unbuilt part of Site A free for the absolutely indispensable trees, which are easily obtainable locally. Howard bones said that, if the reasons for acquiring Site B are stressed by the Foreign Office, he will certainly support them. I will show the notes on wnich tni^ letter is based to Gardener, whom 1 expect to see soon, out I am not writing to Tehran. I don’t in the least Know whether thio land is still available: it is about seven months since we were told that it was. If put off till next year I don’t think there is the remotest hope of our ever getting it ana we remain the guests of the Oil Company which I consider would be deplorable from every point of view.

The sum or two hundred and fifty thousand rials is to be spen^ on building and he expects to commence immediately after the Nourouz. It is therefore not for that purpose that the 'Iheikh’a site' is wanted. '’he Governor General also told me that he thinks that there can be nr difficulty whatever now In the way of our obtaining the land, as he knows that all the necessary arrangements wore made to enable th' he^rs of Hadji Mu*in ut Tujjar to transfer it to a foreigner, T replied that, so far as I am aware, His Majesty’s Government has every intention o f . finishing the buildings there some day, but that the title of the present owner of the land is not absolutely clear. 3.

The General Manager of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company informed me in confidence yesterday that Ahwaz will become an important centre for the Company again within the next two years, as there re important develonment schemes in the Southern Area to be put into effect this year, and drilling and surveys v»ill also be undertaken to the vest of Ahwaz shortly. This may oossibly have some bearing on the future residence of the Consul here, though Mr. F.lkington quite clearly proposes to allow my immediate successor to live in the bungalow which I now occupy, if he wishes to do so. 5. As it does not appear to have been forwarded before, I attach a copy of the only letter in my files on which the tenure of that bungalow deoends, addressed to Major Bremner by the Ahwaz Manager for the Company. I have never been able to find any trace of the letter from the General Manager to which Major .Bremner alluded in his despatch, No. 36 of July 26, 1932, in which Mr. Klkington statea that he can arrange accommodation until such time as a Consulate is provided, and T have never gathered from hia conversation that such is his Intention or desire.

The Imperial Government nave Known for aaoy years that His Majesty's Government desire to acquire the site now in question. It would in fact have been purchased some years ago but for the dispute regarding its true ownership 9 which made purchase impossible, since until it was settled there could be no guarantee that a ealid title would be acquired. It has long been universally Known in Ahw&amp;s that the site was destined for the erection of a British Consulate, and I find that in an official *blua print * plan of vhe^a which was prepared by the hhwag municipality and aignedr by HI• excellency Mlrsa iiaesan Knan Hale, formerly Governor-General of Kbaeletaa, on the 13th Farvardin 131G, the boundaries of the site are clearly marked and the whole area la actually described aa land for the construetion of a consulate’'. Yet the Imperial Government have hitherto given no indication that they iiad any objection to the acquisition of the site by his Majesty’s Government. Their decision to reserve it for their own use would in fact appear to be an extremely recent one, since His xcelleney the Governor—General has informed ills Majesty’s Consul at Aiiwas on several occasions recently that all new Government buildings will be put up on the opposite bank of the river to that on which the site is situated. In view of the absence of any /alternativealternative site and ot tne fact tii*t their desire to acquire tnet now in question has been universally known for many years, I fear that ills Majesty's Government will regard the sudden decision of the Inperlal Government as Inconsiderate to say the least of it, and will contrast it unfavourably with the readiness which they have thenselves shown to meet the wishes of the Imperial Government with regard to the price of parts of the property of his Majesty's negation in Trhran* I earnestly trust therefore that Your xeellency will be able to obtain a reversal of the decision and to ensure that his majesty's Governaeat will shortly be able to acquire a valid title to the site* ( bgd) h# M.

A 'strip of land for this was allowed for when the ares of the 'site was communicated by telegram ffOelS of June 19,1932. Otherwise X consider suggestions of the Ministry gross ‘Miscourtesy in view of the circumstances of the case which 'are fully known to Government. Governor General hue informed me several times recently /that all future Government buildings will be on the right 'bank of the river. May I call your attention to the blue plan submitted in w my despatch Wo.70 of October 25 showing land officially scribed by the Persian Government as destined for 'Consulate. Wo other suitable site is available nor any other 'suitable building but it is unlikely that the Company 'bungalow referred to In your telegram will be relinquished and even If so can the Sheikh of Mohammerah sell or leas. 'to US ? 2. I was told recently that the scheme to make an embankmert road along the Ziver Karun was again under consideration, fhia would necessitate taking a strip of 'Ho 1 Bungalow' garden, a part of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company^ town depot, and a piece of the property occupied by 'Keepers'.All of u. i. ^natohbull-Hugeseen,Ksq. c c.,etc.,etc., TKHHAM .or tiieaa extond to the present normal river—level f whereas the 'Sheikh 9 • Bite”, as eurveyed and caeaeured for ue hy the in«io Iranian Oil Company in 1932,doee not include the thirty -metre strip required for the road. The echeme ie one of the more lunatic conceptions which from time to time find favour in high places* It would require vast expenditure and labour to build an embankment strong enough and high enough to reelst the annual Spring floods. The road itself would serve no useful purpose other than ornamental f and it ee^ms most im probable that it will ever be made. 3. As regards the Ministry's statement that the land which we want*and which has now been occupied for ten years by the buiv&lt; iuga commenced by Government of India engineers* is re quired by the Iranian Government for any definite purpose* I air: unable to believe it* A considerable part of the Mu'in properties ie being taken by the Mimisipality for the town replanning necessitated by the erection of the new Xarun Bridge*(as described in my lost monthly diary), but the *Sheikh Bite' is far outside that area. 4. It would seem therefore that the Iranian Government's suggestions that we should look elsewhere and abandon the buildings already commenced are either calculated discourte^r or an endeavour to use this land for political bargaining* which amounts to the same thing# x ftsei 8 troagi.y that* until his Majesty's Government is in a position to acquire another or better sits or to find premites elsewhere* the Iranian Government must not»under any pretext whatever* be allowed to remove the foundations which are the property of His Majesty's Government and which, as stated above* have been on the 'Sheikh's site' for over ten years. Though ox little value in themselves*! consider that their removal by the Authorities would be the equivalent of theeuddan aloeing of thi« Ooneulato by order of the Governmen and it vould seriouely damage such Influence as may be poBBeeaed by Hie Majesty *b repreBentatives with the local communitiesp be they Arab#Iranian*or British* The occupati« of thie Bite under such circuraBtances by the Iranian Governmentp which has bo far never dared to lay a finger 01 any land required by the Anglo Iranian Oil Company* would be a serious blow to our preatige* 6 * But another possible explanation of the Mlnietry’s suggestion* is that a further effort ie beiiig made to persuade His Majesty’s Oovermaent to build on the right cardc of the river. I am as convinced ae were my predeceesoi that this would be a mistake. It would at once remove any possibility of obtaining water and electric current from the tnglo Iranian Oil Company* and large barrack* and the railway settlement do not appear to me to be at all desirable neighbour*. The representative of Hi* Majesty’s - \ ~ v Office of '#orks*who visited Ahw&amp;z in 1931* was of the opinion that the left bank of the river is preferable and thet the 'Sheikh’s site' is the moat suitable one. I am of the Banc opinion after three years residence her* and in any case I know uf no other one. \\ v 7.

There seems» however, now to he an alternative scheme for obtaining the land in exchange for some land required by the Tehran Municipality (see paragraph 2 of Tehran Despatch of the 2i+th July). V/e are not, however, interested, as Ahwaz is now a Foreign Office post. We are, however, interested in the existing foundations on the Sheikh of Mohammerab/s site, though our interest appears to be confined to avoiding any further expenditure in respect of these foundations, i.e. for their removal. The Government of India have already disclaimed ownership of the site and foundations (see X P.3795/2? and c P. 3208/30). In 193 i 4 . we concurred in a telegram / ^ which the Foreign Office sent to Sir R, stating/stating that His Majesty^ Government do not own, and had no interest in the foundations* In view of this telegram it is hard to see how the Foreign Office can now maintain that the foundations can, in any eventuality, he regarded as the property of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, hut I think it is hardly worth while taking up the point, as the course of action which the Foreign Office now propose to adopt appears to safeguard us against any further expenditure. If His Majesty's Government do at last establish title to the Sheikh's site, then presumably the foundations will have to he removed, hut it will then he the affair of His Majesty's Government.

Sir Samuel Hoare is of the opinion that unless a claim is made to the existing foundations on the 'Sheikh of Mohammerah’s site 1 * by the heirs of the late Haji Muin, these foundations must be regarded as the property of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. He proposes, however, subject to the concurrence of Lord Zetland, to inform His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that in no circumstances should any steps be taken by His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz with regard to the foundations so long as His Majesty’s Government is without a title to the ’’Sheikh’s site”. 3.

No.323. 59 S2 British Legation, Tehran, July 24th, 1935. Sir, With reference to my telegram No.190 of the 24th May, I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz has reported that the Iranian authorities have now withdrawn their opposition to the registration hy the late Hadji Muin’s heirs of their ownership of his property. The local agent of the heirs is therefore now intending to register the land known as the 'Sheikh’s site' within the next few weeks, in accordance with instructions issued in the local press on the 7th July, calling upon all owners of immovable property within a specified area to effect registration within sixty days of that date. Mr. Watkinson adds that wnile registration of ownersnip of the Main property is now possible, any sale of the land is subject to the consent of the Ministry of Finance and would probably be against payment into the Iranian Treasury. Enquiries made at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirm this state ment. It appears that the heirs of Hadji Muin owed money to the Government for unpaid taxes, and the Ministry of Finance have therefore distrained upon the land as security for this debt. The Ministry of Finance have not yet taken any decision with regard to the disposal of the land. But for the present all rights of sale are vested in the Ministry The Right Honourable Sir Samuel Hoare Bart., G.C.S.I., ©tc., etc., etc., Foreign Office4 Ministry and not in the heirs of Hadji Main. Should the heirs pay their debt to the Ministry they will recover full and unrestricted rights of ownership. 2. It therefore appears that in spite of the with drawal of opposition to registration hy the heirs, it may still be possible to carry through the scheme originally proposed in my telegram No. 87 of the 14th March for an exchange of the site at Ahwaz for the Legation land required by the Tehran Municipality. I would therefore suggest that the result of my latest note to the Minister of Foreign Affairs regarding the Legation wall dispute should be awaited (see my despatch No. 273 of the 28th June) before any further action is taken with regard to the acquisition of the site at Ahwaz. 3. Mr, Consul Watkinson has also enquired whether he should now take steps to register as the property of His Majesty's Government the foundations existing on the Sheikh’s site. It appears that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had at first intended to register all their installations situated on land belonging to the heirs of Hadji Muin and others, believing this to be essential whether or not the existence of such installations was mentioned by the owners of the land when registering. They have however now been advised by their Legal Adviser in Tehran that such registration is not compulsory under the Law, though possibly desirable. In view of the considerable expense involved the matter is being further discussed in Tehran. I am requesting the Tehran Manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to inform me of the decision eventually taken.6 4* I am however in any case very doubtful whether any advantage is to he gained by registering these foundations as the property of His Majesty’s Government. They are in them selves of no value where they stand, and if our ownership were admitted it would be necessary to remove them. Ownership of the foundations cannot give us ownership of the land, which is what we require. Further the process of registration will probably be difficult, because under Iranian law a foreign subject can only own land for purposes of residence. Finally it will certainly be by no means easy to establish the title of His Majesty’s Government. The recent transaction by which His Majesty’s Government paid fifty thousand rupees to the Sheikh of Mohammerah cannot be regarded as a sale of the foundations by the latter to his Majesty’s Government and it would, I presume, be necessary to obtain evidence from the accounts of the Indian Public Works Department at Bushire that the foundations were in fact constructed by them. In all the circumstances I would suggest for your consideration that no action need be taken to register the foundations. Should you, however, consider registration desirable, it will be necessary for me to be furnished with evidence of title in time to effect registration before the 5th September. 5. In the meantime I am instructing His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz that he should take no action with regard to the foundations unless they are mentioned in the application for the registration of the land by the heirs of Hadji Muin. In that event he should enter a caveat, in order that registration may be effected if it is considered necessary.6. I am sending copies of this despatch to The Honourable the Political Resident at Bushire No. 67, and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz, No. 28. I have, etc., (Sgd) H.M.

Registration of* site has been forbidden on instructions froir Tehran and it is understood that land has been sequestered by Persian government. If this is so I suggest that we might endeavour to conclude bargain whereby land wanted by municipality here would be ceded in return for land at Ahwaz. 2. Price agreed by Treasury in 1933 for site (a) at Ahwaz was krans 325,000. Consul at Ahwaz strongly urged however (see Chancellory letter to Consular Department March 9th) that we snould also acquire sites (b) and (c) value of which at the same rate is krans 78,288. I have recently visited Ahwaz and strongly concur in his recommendation. Price so far asked for Legation land is krans 414,000 but it is virtually certain that we shall not get it and your telegram No. 51 implies readiness to accept reduction to krans 345,000. 3. If we attempt to do a deal on these lines I think we shall have to accept land in full payment as I do not think Persians would ever give us land and cash. I have not yet mentioned to them possibility of reduction in price of our land here and since we cannot expect to get site (a) plus cash I see no reason why we should not ask for (b) and (c) as( Z P as well. 4. Persians are likely as a matter of fact to argue that value of land at Ahwaz is greater than krans 12 per square metre hut if they do we can reply that figure mentioned in 1933 discussions was only krans 12.50 and that price we are asking here is in any case far lower than market value. 5. If I receive definite confirmation that land has been sequestered may I negotiate on these lines? o. If you concur in arguments in paragraph 3 of my despatch No.17 our action vis-a-vis Sheikh would not seem to he affected.f ' r &gt; c 'Dt 1/ I !93o ] NO DISTRISUTIOK, Decode. Ivir.

Sir, In reply to your despatch No# 604 of December 7th (K 12889/108/234), respecting the post of Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, I have the honour to report that I find some difficulty in expressing a positive opinion upon the possibility of abolishing this post. The position is, of course, that although the post may not have been formally abolished it has not been filled for the last two years, and that during these two years none of the officers who have successively acted as Consul for Khusistan have complained that the work is too much for them to cope with single-handed. This has always slightly surprised me, for the work must be fairly heavy as well as important, but the fact that tne consular offices and Ahwaz and Moharamerah work in close conjunction, so that there are in reality two officers for a single consular district of Khuzistan, no aoubt eases the situation. I have no wish to intereferewith the existing arrangement so long as the Consul on the spot is content, but if he were at any time to press for a Vice- Consul to assist him I must confess that I should be predisposed to consider that his representations were well-founded• 2 , My views on this question are independent of the rank of the officer in charge of the post, for the /amount The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc#, etc#, etc., The Foreign Office.amount of work will remain unaffected whether a Consul- General or a Consul is in charge. The only difference which the appointment of a Consul-General might make is that an older man would possibly be less disposed than a younger owe. to attend to petty matters of office routine himself and therefore more likely to ask for assistance. I earnestly hope, however, that this possibility will not be allowed to stand in the way of the appointment of a Consul-General. 3. I agree, however, that the post may be formally abolished, if any advantage in matters of accountancy is to be gained thereby, on the understanding that my agreement does not debar me from asking that it be restored if its restoration appears necessary at any time in the future. 4. So far as the Vice-Consul’s residence is concerned, I agree that a decision may be taken in principle to dispense with it as soon as possible, but I would suggest that for the reasons given in Hr. Watkinson’s despatch to you. No. 7 of May 15th, no steps should be taken to put this decision into effect until (a) a final decision has been taken to retain the headquarters of the Consul-General or Consul at Ahwaz, and (b) definite steps have been taken to secure a site at Ahwaz which will allow for the construction of a Vice-Consul’s as well as a Consul’s residence if future developments render necessary the restoration of the former post.

It is noted that the Haji Muin is now dead, but presumably his claim to the site has devolved upon his heirs.

Sir Samuel Hoare will observe that in his telegram * to His Majesty’s Minister, the Secretary of State has disclaimed, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, all interest in the foundations on the *Sheikh of Mohamerah’s site' at Ahwaz. In view of the terms of India Office letter of May 21st, 1930, (P 3208/30), he considered it unnecessary to consult the Secretary of State for India before doing so.

I should explain, before offering any farther observations, that when I discussed with Sir John Cadman the possibility of acquiring a residence at Mohammerah, as foreshadowed in paragraph 2 of my despatch No.160, he expressed the opinion that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company ** be ! * ble t, ° transfer a suitable residence and that he would consider the question on his return to I.ondon. Sine, then I have not heard whether any discussions have ensued between your department and the London office of the company, but I understand that your department in any ease n», ne to the view that if suitable accommodation can possibly be arranged in Ahwaz, the headquarters of the Consular district should remain there. 3. It is clearly difficult for me to enter into discussions with the Persian Government without knowing whether His Majesty's Government are still prepared to The Right Honourable Tarnish Sir John Simon, O.C.S.I., etc. p etc. f etc, f The Foreign Office.furnish funds f^r the purchase of a site for a Consulate, hut it Is equally clear that without some Idea of the cost of the oronosed site His Majesty’s Oovermaent *ill be unwilling to commit themselves to a definite decision. In these circumstances I have thought it best to make tentative enquiries of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the heirs of Hajl Muin-ut-Tuj jar, who has died during the summer, and I shall reoort the result in due course. 4. In the meantime I would urge that such preliminary steps as are possible should be taken with a view to trie nrov'Sion of the necessary funds in the next budget for the acquisition of a consilar residence either at Ahwas or Mohammerah. 5. I h^ve the honour to draw your particular attention to orragraph 9 of Mr. atk^nson's despatch. There can nev construction of the Consul’s house, of wnich the, walls f (both exterior and interior, and to a height of two feet six inches; stand full across what is now a nubile road. The ground which was expropriated for this road was the property either of the Persian Government or of Haji Muin-ut-Tujjar, but the foundations which have been marooned by the exoroor*'ation are the property either of His Majesty’s Government’(or of the Government of India) or of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. So far as the immediate problem is concerned, the Sheikh can be left out of consideration. The immediate problem is that if no ste' S are t'ken to remove these foundations, the Municipality will inevitably become more and more irritated, and tnat in the end they may proceed, either of their own volition or under orders from the Shah (who is expected to visit Fhuziston fairly soon) to remove them themselves. If thisthis har&gt;T&gt;en6 we shall be nlaced in the T)oB' ; tion of having to create an incident over the violation of a niece of orooerty which is of no use to us and nev r can be, 6. In these circ imstances I should be glad if I might receive your ocrraission, by telegram, to authori se Mr.Watklnson to have that part of the foundations which orojects into the mad removed and the stones and bricks of which it is comnosed stored in some convenient nlace. If it is thought that the stone and brick is not likely to be worth the cost of salvage, it will be sufficient to tell the Municipality that the foundations are no longer of interest to His Modesty’s Government and that they are free to do what t ey like with them. But in either case I should be glad of very early instructions. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No.845) and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (No.107). I have, etc., (Rd.) R.H. HOARS.COPY No.79. British Consulate, Ahwaz* 8th November, 1933 Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 24 of April 27 last, forwarding a copy of a memorandum prepared for the information of Sir John Cadraan regarding the housing of the incumbent of this post and relating the progress of negotiations with Hadji Moin-ut-Tujjar for the purchase of the so-called 'Sheikh's site' in Ahwaz, I have the honour to inform you of the following recent occurrences here. 2. A few days ago the Governor General paid me his first call since my return from tour. After telling me of his building schemes at Dizful, of the projected new bridge across the Karun, and of his desire to stimulate agricultural production in Khuzistan, he asked me what I propose to do about the foundations of the buildings on the 'Sheikh's site'. I replied that I propose to do nothing for the moment and he then changed the subject. This was obviously not a satisfactory reply from any body's point of view. As you are aware, the existence of the 'Consul's house', as shown on the plan submitted by Mr. Monypenny with his despatch No.20 of April 22, 1932, holds up the Ahwaz town-planning scheme, which provides for two parallel roads running along each side of the Bagh-i-Melli and continuing in a northerly direction for about one mile as far as the railway. Both of these roads His Majesty's Charg£ d'Affaires British Legation, Tehran.roads are actually in existence, the one nearer to the river (between M No»l Bungalow, Anglo Persian Oil Company’* and the Bagh-i-t elli) being cut in two by this building on the 'Sheikh’s site'. 3* Major Bremner reported in the course of his Opus No* 30, of June 18, 1932, (page 8), that part of the site has been 'appropriated by the Municipality for the National 'Park'. He did not mention the road, which now forms the boundary of the 'Sheikh’s site' as marked in red on Mr* Monypenny’s plan referred to above, though the building projects into the Municipal area and completely blocks the road* The area referred to in Major Bremner’s telegram of June 19, 1932, is that within the red line. 4. Immediately adjoining the 'Sheikh’s site', at the northern end of the Bagh-i-Melli* is a plot of ground three thousand square zars in area, which was acquired by the Municipality from Hadji Moin some years ago. The Deputy Governor informs me that this is now to be sold at the price of three tomans per square zar and that a buyer has been found. It was always understood that the new Baladieh building was to be erected on that site, but that the late Governor General was unable to find the necessary funds* 5* I have little doubt that it was the intention of Nadir Mirza Arasteh, the late Governor General, to have other Government buildings, probably his own offices and residence, on the adjacent 'Sheikh’s site', and it seems likely that this was the reason for the attitude of the Persian Government last March, when it was proposed that His Majesty’s Government should be content with an area of ten thousand square zars only. 6* That bogy may now be considered to be disposed of, for4 80,000 Sq#zar^“ for the foundation stones of Baladieh offices were laid officially hy the Governor General on the 1st instant on a site of some eighty thousand square zars situated about half way between the ’’Sheikh’s site” and the Karon Railway Bridge. The Governor General and the deputy Governor have both assured me that it is now intended to build all the Govemorate General and Municipal offices there. Foundations for several buildings are already being dug. 7. I therefore consider the moment most opportune for re-opening negotiations with the heirs of Hadji Moin and for again requesting the good offices of the Persian Government in the matter. 8. It would presumably be necessary in this case to secure an assurance from the Foreign Office of the re instatement of the credit in next year’s budget. While convinced that it is essential to acquire areas B and C. I beg to suggest that immediate sanction be requested for negotiation in respect of area A with the hope at a later date of persuading the Office of ' r orks of the necessity for acquiring the larger site, should it still be available. 9. A further reason for re-opening this question with the Persian Government is that I anticipate being asked again at an early date by the local authorities for an indication as to the intentions of His Majesty’® Government with regard to the existing buildings, which have always been considered as being British property and which will, in fact, indisputably be the property of His Majesty’s Government when Sheikh Khaz’al has been paid as recommended in your despatch No.14 to the Foreign Office of January 14 last. 10. I beg to submit most earnestly that neither the question of the appointment of a Consul General for this Consular000,08 * Consular district nor that of the possible temporary transfer of head—quarters to Mohammerah, which this night entail § in any way affects the urgent necessity for obtaining land in Ahwaz for the building of permanent premises after thirty years of bubble, bubble, toil antf trouble* I have, e tc., (Signed) A.E.

The issue of the above has been authorisedPolitical Secretary, I agree that, in theory, if the post of Vice-Consul is always to be staffed from the Indian Political Service, the cost of installing permanent fittings to his house should be wholly an Indian liability. One would have thought too that the rent_ of his house would equally be an Indian liability^/But, as far as I understand it, the position at Ahwaz is that the rent of the Consuls house is met wholly from British revenues and that the rent of the Vice-Consul's house and of the Consulate offices (including current expenditure on the latter) is shared equally between British and Indian revenues. India accepts direct liability for the Vice-Consul's house and recovers a moiety of the rent from the Foreign Office. This, I think, is all that is meant by the statement that 'the Government of India are responsible for the Vice-Consul's residential quarters' on P.7257/30. In addition, although it may fairly be described as a capital charge, H.M.G. have agreed to accept a moiety of the cost of installing water and electric fittings/r §£) (fimt/ic ,rrn/jo) % fijttings in the Vice-Consul's house. In view of this I do not think that the cost of installing sanitary fittings which has been incurred apparently without the prior concurrence of the Foreign Office of £100 and I suggest that it be borne equally between British and Indian revenues. When the fittings are eventually disposed of the proceeds would then be equally divisible between British and Indian revenues.

The Secretary of State supports this recommendation. It has not yet been decided that the post for a vice-consul at Ahwaz should be abolished, and the proposal in Foreign Office letter of May 31st, (K 3791/11/234) that the consular post there should be raised to the status of consulate- general renders it more probable that a vice-consul will be retained. Moreover, no decision hes yet been reached 'A , regarding the suggestion contained in Mr. Hoare s despatches Nos. 160 and 161 of April 7th that accommodation for His Majesty’s Consulate in Khuzistan should be sought in Mohammerah. 2. The Secretary of State will accept a moiety of the cost of continuing the present arrangements for the accommodation of a vice-consul at Ahwaz from the date of the expiry of the . of the existing house in September 1932 until the house Your obedient Servant, I am Sir The Under Secretary of State India Office.COPY (K 6147/108/234) No. 7. BRITISH CONSULATE, AHWAZ. 15th May, 1933, Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 1 of to-day’s date, regarding the lease of a house for His Majesty’s Vice Consul in Ahwaz, I have the honour to submit the following considerations. 2. Sanction was granted, in accordance with Memorandum No. F.471-A/30, dated February 11, 1931, from the Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for the leasing of a house at Ahwaz at Krs. 350. a rental of Krans three hundred and fifty per month for a period of two years from the date on which the house was taken on lease for the accommodation of His Majesty’s Vice Consul and for the installation of water and electricity in £.100. the house at a combined cost of one hundred pounds. The expenditure was to be divisible in moieties between the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. The period covered by this sanction ended in September, 1932. 3. On February 4, last, the Honourable the Political Resident recommended that the house be given up in view of the proposed abolition of the post of Vice Consul and that the water and electricity fittings should be disposed of. The Government of India agreed to these recommendations, which have now been submitted for your concurrence. 4. His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I K C ^ C Foreign Office, FROM ^ London. 27 JUL U53 4 1 • r ~ PT. INDIA 0 T r4. Since these recommendations were made His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has submitted various proposals for the reorganization of the Consular establishment in Khuzistan, to which I would invite your attention. In Mr. Hoare’s despatch No. 99 of March 11, last, it was recommended that a Consul General be appointed to Ahwaz with a pied h terre in Mohammerah. An alternative proposal was submitted in Mr. Hoare’s despatch No. 161 of the 7th ultimo to the effect that the Consulate General or Consulate might be established temporarily at Mohammerah with an office and pied h terre retained in Ahwaz. It was pointed out that, in the meanwhile, the incumbent at this post is housed under a provisional arrangement with the Anglo Persian Oil Company which, in addition to being of a temporary nature lays His Majesty’s Government under an obligation which is undesirable. 5. I beg to submit that it is now highly desirable to retain the Vice Consul’s house pending a decision on the above points. It is the ideal pied &amp; terre in the event of headquarters being moved to Mohammerah, being but five minutes away from the office. It is situated near to the Governor General’s office and to all other administrative and commercial offices. It is further equipped with proper sanitary and electrical fittings. It would be difficult, if possible at all, to find any similar building in the town. 6. Should this house be retained in addition to that which I at present occupy the total expenditure would be as follows Rent of Consul’s house at Khazalieh Rials 450 per month (£54/- per annum at present rate of exchange). RentRent of Vice Consul's house Rials 350 per month (£42/- per annum at present rate of exchange). 7. Of this sum half of the rent of the Vice Consul's house is at present defrayed by the Government of India. I would suggest that the total liability for this rent be taken over by His Majesty's Government which would then be sublet until such time as it may be required on giving- up the present Anglo-?ersian Oil Company house. Provided that a reasonable lease with at least 2 months’ notice to the sub-tenant could be guaranteed I am informed that there will be no difficulty whatever in finding a tenant willing to pay at least half the rent at present paid to the landlord. This would reduce the above expenditure on the part of His Majesty's Government by the sum of feasible to give, the higher the rent could be demanded. Majesty's Minister at Tehran No. 40 and to the Honourable the Political Resident at Bushire No. 878. £96. incur a total expenditure of ninety six pounds per year for Consular residential accomodation in Ahwaz. 8. Subject to your approval the town house could £21. twenty one pounds per annum. The longer the lease it is 9. If this arrangement meets with your approval, Av.. J ‘«wA£^I presume that the electrical and sanitary fittings .(,( would remain, as at present, the joint property of the Government of India and of His Majesty's Government, until such time as they are eventually disposed of. 10.

H.B.M'S CONSUL POR KHUZISTAN.wma fcNCt.OSUJV*' *n wrtu?: (36V&amp;RING I r THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT WITH reference to paragraphs 356 to 358 of the animal report on Persia for 1932, I have the honour to report that the oriental secretary recently visited the Sheikh of Mohammerah, on His Majesty’s Minister’s instructions, to discuss the matter of the rent of His Majesty’s vice-consulate at Mohammerah. 2. Mr. Trott found Sheikh Khazal in bed on the floor of his country house, looking old and feeble. Muhandis-ul-Mamalik, the sheikh's man of affairs, was present, and the talk naturally turned chiefly on the sheikh’s attempt to get an arrangement with the Ministry of Finance. He has heard nothing from that Department for months, nor can he ever get a reply to his frequent messages. It is now nearly two years since the sheikh, at the Ministry’s suggestion, signed a letter drafted by the Ministry agreeing to a valuation of his properties in the south with a view to their exchange for properties of a similar value in a different part of Persia. The commission sent to Khuzistan to examine the land returned last spring to Tehran at the Ministry’s request, and since then no progress has been made. The sheikh expressed himself to Mr. Trott as in despair; it was no good his petitioning the Shah, as His Majesty knew quite well about the delays. 3. Finding the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a most amiable mood when I called upon him last week, I mentioned Sheikh Khazal’s affairs, and asked him whether he could not speak a word to the Shah about them. His Highness said that he would rather speak to the Minister of Finance, though he was, he knew, overwhelmed with other work, poor man. I urged Feroughi to do this, and he said that he would, though I much doubt whether he will get any satisfaction out of Taghizadeh, even if he has the energy to speak to him. Mr. Trott had, as a matter of fact, already spoken a word to Taghizadeh on the subject at the King’s birthday party and had not received any encouragement. His Excellency, in fact, treated the matter as of no importance whatever. Ignoring the delay in replying to the sheikh's petition, Taghizadeh said that the sheikh had property outside Persia which provided for his immediate needs; that his affairs were in great confusion; and that the Ministry could not extract clear statements from the sheikh. The last statement is completely at variance with the version of Muhandis-ul-Mamalik. Mr. Trott derived the clear impression that Taghizadeh had no intention whatever of lifting a finger on the sheikh's behalf. 4. Feroughi asked me with a bland smile why His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom took such an interest in the sheikh. I answered that surely his Highness must know the reason, which was a relic of the “ bad old days ” of the war, when the sheikh had rendered great services to our forces fighting the Turks. His Majesty's Government had a long memory for their friends, and the sheikh’s present misfortunes were on their conscience. I begged his Highness therefore to make an effort to get the sheikh’s affairs regulated in order that one further obstacle might be removed from the way of the perfect relations which ought, as a result of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Agreement, now to exist between our countries. I knew that the Foreign Office took a lively interest still in this matter of the sheikh; on the other hand, the Persian Government could not now lay themselves open to an accusation of having yielded to British pressure if they afforded a measure of common justice to a poor and ailing man. Feroughi took all this very well, but I shall be surprised if I have shaken his habitual lethargy. 5. A further subject mentioned by the sheikh to the oriental secretary was that of the 50,000 rupees which he had advanced for the building of a consulate at Ahwaz and which formed the subject of Mr. Hoare's despatch No. 14 of the 14th January last. The gist of the sheikh’s remarks was : “ Whatever is decided PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [E 3618/3618/34] No. 1. {No. 285.) Sir, Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon.—{Received July 4.) Gulhek, June 15, 1933.

You will have observed from our letter 17 o.P. 350- 1 / 3 1 dated the 21st June 1932, ' / that the Government of India have suggested that the sale proceeds of the materials at site should be divided between the Sheikh and the Government of India in the proportion of the expenditure incurred by them respectively. This suggestion was made because the Government of India recognized that the Sheikh had been prevented from performing his part of the contract by ’force maleure *, and did not therefore deserve to be penalized for breach of contract. But they cannot accept Hoare's suggestion that the money advanced by the Sheikh to the Public Works Department for commencing the works on his behalf should be treated as a loan repayable to him, and they are not prepared to go beyond the proposals made in their letter of the 21st June 1932. ••8 m - J. G. Laithwaite, Esquire, India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.l. (With 2 s.ce of letter only'iritish Legation, Te hr a n. 14th January 193L. I th* honour to report the! In the course of a conversation with the orients! Secretary a few days ago the Sheikh of rohsaaerah mentioned, somewhat wistfally* the sun of fifty or sixty thouaand Kuaeaa that he had advanced for the building of Hie Majesty’s Consulate at Aherns, and without formulating any definite request implied that he hoped he night recover this sum one day* This is the first time that the Sheikh has spontaneously raised the point, although he once sentioned the money he had spent In reply to a question by Sir H* Clivss it nsy be that ha has hitherto thought it possible that the original arrangement night be revived provided his own financial situation improved* Mow that he knows His Majesty^ Oovernnent are negotiating to purchase the 'Sheikh's site' outright fron Haji Hula, ha has probably concluded that it is not. I believe that the amount advanced is actually fifty thoueanu Rupees only. 2. The fact that the Sheikh has recently acknowledged the right of Hajl min to the ownership of the site, without receiving any compensation for doing so (see ay despatch go. 230 of 13th May, 1932) doss not affect, la any essential respect, the position of either the Sheikh or the Haji In regard to the building transaction. The lend hae always bslongsd to the tieji, but as long ago as 1903 he gave the Sheikh a document in which he egreed that if the letter were to build a house /upon The Right Honoureble air lohn Simon, G.C. 8 .I., etc., etc., etc.,L • /Cg * &amp; Q,i.Q92: - 8 - «j^.9j-222 upon that land and leaaa tne nouaa ta His Majesty's GoYarnment» ha (the Haji) would place the site at his disposal la return for half the rent derived fron the house. He also agreed that the Sheikh should eoaduot all the negotiations with His Kajestjr v s Government. This, according to Haji tfuln, la still his position! In other words, he la willing to go ahead with the transaction whenever the Sheikh wishes to do so. The Sheikh, however, la very hard up at present and even if he could advance the money I am of the opinion that Kla Majesty’s Government should avoid continuing this rather unsatisfactory arrangement, and huy or rent outright whatever land or buildings aay be required. 3. As s result of ths Sheikh’s remark, I have gone carefully into the question of the position as bstween him and His Majesty's Government in respect of his advance of Rupees fifty thousand; this has, X cannot help feeling, been somewhat obscured by his relations with the Persian Government and the Muln. The faots are simple enough. After the war His Majesty's Government, or rather the Government of India, revived a project of many years standing to acquire a Consulate at Ahwas, but were unable to find the money for the purchase of a site and the oonstruetion of a house. They therefore ssked the Sheikh whether he would build them s house or houses upon a certain piece of land, undertaking, if he did so, to lease the houses from him st s stated rent for s term of years. Ths Sheikh consented and a detailed agreement was drawn up. The houses were to be built at a ooat not axoeedlng two and a half lakhs of rupees, and ths Government of India would rent them for thirty years at a rent squalling sight per /cent • ——- 3 - %Mt §9jLgS9.i m I Si g OQl 63«9Q0* o«nt on the outlay. At this stage a minor complication arose# as the Oovernment of India wished the houses to he constructed according to their own ideas; it was therefore arranged that the Oorernaent of India should undertake the actual hutiding and the Sheikh merely make advances from time to time. fie had made advances totalling fifty thousand rupees and the Government of India had ^&gt;ent this and some thirteen thousand rupees besides# when circumstance! prevented the Sheikh from advancing any more money. These circumstances were of such e kind as to merit the deeoriptioz force mat wire , being in fact the kidnapping and removal of the Sheikh to Tehran on political grounds# and the virtual sequestration of hie property in Khusietan. At this time (early 1926) the foundations of two houses and a quantity of building material represented the sixty three thousand rupees that had been spent. Subsequently the municipality of Ahwas evolved e town-planning scheme which required the surrender of a part of the site# including half of the foundations of tha smaller of the houses# thereby rendering the money spent on its foundation practically a dead loss. Also the building materisle were sold with a view to the division of the money so obtained between the Government of Indie and the Sheikh# in the proportions that eaoh had spent on the construction. The sum so obtained did not exoeed a few thousand rupees. 4. Mow I presume that a strictly legal interpretation of these facta would be that tha Shaikh had entered into e contract which events beyond hie control had prevented hie fulfilling) ana that though the other party might not in the circumstances be justified in demanding compensation for breach of contract# they could# /on4 - r /* SOiOQ.Og, (in' on tho other hand, not bo bold roaponalblo for tbo r«lttbursement of any sw*e that he eight have already expended with the object of carrying out that oontraet. 5* But this is not, X submit, a case in whieh a purely legal interpretation should prevail. In the first place, gls Majesty^ gov ernment, though not responsible for the events that made it impossible for the Sheikh to carry out his contract, wers at any rat# partially responsible for the fact that he vaa forced to submit to thoj events inasmuch as they vere unable to afford him the degree of support which would have enabled hla to resist; and though they have since done their best to regal* for him his liberty and hla property, in compliance with a generally acknowledged moral obligation, there can be no doubt that they have felled to do so. 6. In the second place, the agreement for the construction of tho consulate was not of the sheikh's seeking} he entered into it, presumably, out of regard for the Government of India and in order to assist them to acquire a Consulate, which they could not otherwise do. X expect that hie point of view le that he has lent the Government of India fifty thousand rupees and has not been repaid. The suggestion that the money which he spent on the foundations was in the nature of a loan le fortified by the fact that this money was not expanded direct, but paid over to the Government of Indie, and it la not weakened by the feot that repayment was to take place over a period of years. The Sheikh would aieo contend, X think, that it was not hie fault that the money he advaneed was sunk by the recipient in whet night prove to have been an unprofitable building venture.- 6 - 7* In reply to this it might bo objected that the venture wae unprofitable only because the Sheikh 9 a title to the land beeame ao suspect after his departure to Tehran that the Oovernnent of India were unable to proceed with the vork themselves, either by borrowing the necessary money elsewhere, or by constructing ths houses st their own expense (repaying the Sheikh as a preliminary) and paying no rant except a ground-rent* The Sheikh would probably respond by pointing out thst his title was only open to doubt because of political events beyond the control not only of hlaself, but of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India* Ha night add that it was never conclusively proved thst the Persian Government would not enter in an arrangement to recognise any lease granted by the Sheikh without prejudice te a subsequent discielon ae to whose the site might be* 0. The further ooaplicatlon of the claim of Hajl '4Uin is quite irrelevant* It aay be that the Sheikh had really forgotten that the site belonged to the Hajl, or that he remembered right enough and waa merely using (and but for the events of 1925 would have gone on using) his local influence to purloin the sits, or that when he called the land hla, he aeant hie and his partner’s (the Haji)* Whichever alternative la correct. It does not affect the fact that, when convinced of the validity of the hajl , a claim, the Sheikh offered to meet this claim by giving the Hajl an aqulvalent site elsewhere and that the Hajl, for hla part, was willing to continue the original arrangement, either with or without the Sheikh* This claim has, therefore \ et no time formed an obstacle to the continued construction /ofof th« two houses and the position today is that, so far as the Haji is concerned, the Sheikh nay carry out the original transaction with ills Majesty’s Government. This His Majesty's Government to make what arrangements they like with the Haji. position In law or equity may he, the sun of fifty thousand that its repaynent must he regarded as a debt of honour. I therefore venture to express the earnest hope thst Hie Majesty's Government or the Government of Indie will undertake to repay this money, irrespective of what decision may be taken as to the future use of the Ahwas site. In return the Sheikh should waive all further olaims in respect of the land itself, the foundations of the two ^ houses and the building materials. 10. I should add that this view was held by sy predecessor, and the recommendation made by him in paragraph 16 of his despatch Ho. 692 of August 11th, 1930, is Indistinguishable in essence fron my own, the Hajl having been substituted for the Persian Government. 11.

Si?, With reference to my despatch No. 3®^ of July 5th regarding Consular accommodation at Ahwaz, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, copies of two despatches from the acting British Consul reporting that he has terminated the lease of the house rented by Mr. Monypenny since October 1930 and has obtained from the General Manager of the Anglo- 1 Persian Oil Company Limited an assurance that the bungalow that he now occupies will be at the disposal of His Majesty’s Consul until such time as His Majesty’s Government can make other arrangements. 2. In view of the condition of the rented house and of the fact that the General Manager is now able to place an Anglo-Persian Oil Company bungalow at the disposal of the Consul (which he has been unable to do hitherto), I have no doubt that Major Bremner acted wisely in terminating the lease of the rented house. 3. As regards the accommodation of a second officer, there is at present little prospect of the Vice-Consular appointment being filled, but it has in any case been arranged with the Government of India that any Vice-Consul appointed to Ahwaz shall be a bachelor. 4. With regard to the electric light fittings, The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office. Mr. MonypennyMr. Monypennji, who is now in Tehran, tells me that it is in his opinion unlikely that these fittings would he suitable for use in the new Consulate, and he thinks thaL if they were sold now they might fetch a price in excess of their book value. I should be glad to learn whether His Majesty^ Office of Works see any objection to Major Bremner selling these fittings if he can obtain a good price. 5. I should also be glad of instructions with regard to the disposal of the water pipes. 6. I shall address you separately on the possibility of the construction of the new Consulate by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Acting.

Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with my despatch No. 33, dated 27th June, 1932, I have the honour to ireport that in accordance with clause 6 of the lease, the landlord of Mr. Consul Monypenny’s house has been served with a month*s notice on 30th June 1932 and the building will be made overt o the landlord by the end of this month. All the fittings will be dismantelled and carefully stored pending your instructions as to their ultimate disposal. The amount charged to His Majesty’s Government for the entire electric and water fittings amounted to Kraus 13,999.60 or £166.12.1 (as per statement 'A” enclosed) for which the necessary sanction from the Foreign Office was obtained. The actual cost of the removable materials is approximately Krans 9,214.60 and the balance of Krans 4,785/- represents Anglo Persian Oil Company’s charges for labour and supervision in connection with the installation of the electric and water fittings, Bank remittance charges, paints, cement, packing, freight, etc. (as per statement ’B’ enclosed). As R.H. Hoare, Esquire, C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, etc., etc., etc., British Legation, TEHERANAs the removal of the electric wiring and subsequent repairs to the walls will be more than the actual cost of the wiring it is proposed to let it remain. The cost of removal of the electric fans and lavatory fittings will be charged to the Foreign Office in my account current. The water pipes are laid about six to ten inches in the ground and their removal, cartage and subsequent storage would involve heavy expenditure to His Majesty’s Government. As these pipes are in use for the past two years and are not likely to be brought into commission by the Foreign Office in the near future it is proposed, subject to your approval, to have them sold as they stand, should a favourable offer be received. The Anglo Persian Oil Company have kindly put at my disposal a small bungalow in their concession area for the time being and the permanent General Manager, Abadan, has addressed me to the effeet that this favour will continue to be accorded to my successor.

With reference to the eventual construction ofsdequate Consular accoramodaLion at Ahwaz, I have the honour to submit herewith for your informatibn anexvraco from a private letter dated 17th June, 1932 from Mr. E.H.O. Elkington (General Manager, Abadan) to my address. 'With reference to the building of the new Consulate 'I suggest that the Clerk of Works in Teheran take 'on the job. We can give him an office and assist 'him in maflyways, but I cannot expect that my people 'will undertake the actual building now.' It would thus appear that there will be some doubt if the original proposal can be entertained i.e. that the Anglo Persian Oil Company should build the Consulate (Vide Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No.377 of 2nd August 1930) The circumstances have greatly changed since by the reduction in Anglo Persian Oil Company personnel etc., and these are the reasons which apparently cause Mr. Elkington his present doubts. There can however be no doubt that should it still be possible to obtain the g ood offices of the Company in R.H. Hoare, Esquire, C.M.G., , His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, etc., etc., etc., British Legation, Teheran. this— js P^ ; &gt; —\ lie this matter, the resultant saving to Government, over anything that can he undertaken by the Office of Works, would be about 33*1/3^, apart from the very great advantage accruing from the Company’s vastly superior knowledge of local conditions, prices and requirements# The situation is therefore submitted to you for consultation with the Resident Director, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, should you deem such course desirable# As regards temporary accommodation for His Majesty’s Consul in the interim Mr# Elkington writes ”1 can arrange to accommodate one married Consular Official until such time as a Consulate be provided in the Bungalow whicw you now occupy but I cannot arrange to accommodate two married Consular Officers in this manner. I wonder if you could convey this state of affairs to the necessary Powers.” It is unierstood that a proposal for the abolition of the post of Vice-Consul, or at any rate for his provision by the Government of India, has been submitted to the Higher Authorities. If so, then the problem of finding accommodation for two officers is automatically settled# I In any case the appointment of Vice-Consul is usually held by a very junior officer of the Political Department of the Government of India if not generally by a Probationer. \ As such he is unlikely to be married. As regards accommodation for the permanent Consul. Whilst in no way wishing to appear ungrateful for the great kindness of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in affording the Department a sanitary asylum, the accommodation in the bungalowbungalow at present occupied by myself could in no way be considered adequate for a senior married officer, though it might serve the purpose ordinarily for a junior bachelor. This fact is brought to your notice with regard to the eventual posting of a permanent Consul in Ahwaz.

Sir, In reply to your letter with enclosures dated the 3rd instant (K.8747/670/234) regarding the acquisition of a site for consular purposes at Ahwaz, I am directed by the First Commissioner of His Majesty’s Works, etc., to state,for the information of Secretary Sir John Simon, that in the circumstances the Board are prepared to make savings this financial year to meet the c ost of the land required. 2. They are not satisfied, however, that the inclusion of site B is essential. The original area of the Sheikh’s site was 46,690 square yards and in 1930 H.M. Consul considered that of this area, a minimum of 18,000 square yards would suffice for a Consul’s house, a Vice-Consul’s house, and the necessary accommodation for office purposes, but not for sowar’s quarters and stables. It is now proposed to acquire almost twice this quantity of land for the same purpose and to acquire in addition an area of 5,779 square yards for the stables, stores, godowns, etc., making a total area of 40,777 square yards or over 8 acres. The Board are advised that the residue of the Sheikh’s site, measuring 34,998 square yards, would provide ample space above / flood level for the buildings required, including the Vice- Consul’s residence, the necessity for which is still apparently The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l. inin doubt. It may also be possible to reclaim the land liable to flood in a manner similar to that adopted in the case of the bungalow site adjoining. 3. I am accordingly to request that H.M. Minister may be instructed to ascertain the price asked for Site A. As site B is not liable to flood, it is presumably of greater value per square yard than Site A, and this should be reflected in the price asked for Site A. I am, etc., (Signed) 1.0.

In the view of this Department a more equitable settlement would be to divide the sale proceeds in the ratio of the total net expenditure (including departmental expenses) incurred by the Sheikh and the Government of India. ^ In this connection it would appear that the Government of India’s proposal, as interpreted on P.Z. 4027/32,in so far as departmental expenses were omitted from India’s side of the account, would hardly have been fair to Indian revenues. ^On the other hand the expenditure attributed to the Sheikh was very small).i-Iow that the site has passed into the hands of the IfMin-ut-Tujjar and that the British Government’s negotiations over tcite appear to be solely with the Muin, it is presumed that the settlement indicated in paragraph 4 of Mr. Monypenny’s letter dated the 7th ’..arch 1932 (P.Z. 2719/32) has been concluded. If this is the case the Sheikh’s net expenditure becomes Rs. 50,000 less the cost of the foundations. The cost of the foundations was - see P.Z.7100/31 - approximately Rs. 43,000 and the Government of India’s net expenditure will become Rs.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 230 of May 13th regarding Consular accommodation at Ahwaz, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of a despatch from Major C.E.U.Bremner, who recently arrived at Ahwaz to act as Consul during the absence of Mr. Monypenny in Tehran. This despatch is of exceptional value as representing the first impressions of a new-comer with an extensive experience of living conditions in the East. It has of course been recognised for a long time past both in the Foreign Office and at the Legation that the consular accommodation was exceedingly unsatisfactory and a decision to remedy this state of affairs was taken in principle a long while back. My object in forwarding Major Brenmer's despatch is not therefore to draw attention to the existing conditions, although in a sense too much attention cannot be drawn to them, but to show the urgent need of proceeding with the purchase of a site and the erection of buildings now that certain preliminary difficulties especially the doubt as to the ownership of the most likely site, have been cleared away. The necessity for an urgent decision is increased by the information conveyed to me by Mr. Monypenny, who is now in Tehran, that the house which he has occupied for the The Eight Honourable Sir John Simon G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.1 &lt;1 « 1 a Krans 15. £5,000 £ 6,000 last two years is now practically uninhabitable owing to the failure of the water supply and to the frequent failure of the electric current necessary for its fans and lights. 2. Since his despatch was written I have received by telegram from Major Bremner particulars of the survey mentioned therein. This shows that the original site (Area A) is 34998 square yards or 29301 square metres in area and the additional bit of land whicu it is proposed should be purchased (Area B) 5779 square yards or 4838 square metres. The average price of the land, including buildable and unbuildable land is fifteen krans per square metre which works out au about five thousand pounds for the whole site. I am taking 'steps to ascertain the lowest price which the Muin-ut-Tajjar will accept for the site. As a comment upon the general value of the site I may add thau the Anglo-Pers- ian Oil Company are understood to have offered the Sheikh of Mohammerah six thousand pounds for the adjoining 'No. 1' site. This included the building which then stood upon it, but the area itself is smaller and the value of land has since risen considerably and should go on rising. 3. as regards the acquisition of the additional area, I am strongly of the opinion that it would be false economy not to acquire it. Not only will this ensure that the Consulate has no undesirable neighbours, hut the whole area is really necessary if the stores, stables, etc., of the Consulate are to be concentrated in the way Major Bremner suggests. Moreover, while a Consular residence and offices should be erected on the site as soon as possible, space should also be left available for the erection of a Vice-Consul’s residence should this become necessary in the future. 4.4. I shall inform you 'by telegraph as soon as I know the Muin’s lowest price and I trust that in the meanwhile provisional sanction may be obtained for the purchase of the site and for the construct ion of the necessary buildings. So much has already been written on this subject that I do not think it is necessary for me to add any further arguments in support of this proposal. 5. I assume thai, plans for the erection of the necessary build ings have already been prepared by His Majesty’s Office of Works. Sir Robert Clive suggested (see his despatch No. 377 of 2nd August, 1930) that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should he invited to undertake the actual construction. This suggestion I earnestly support. The company have their own engineering and building departments: they have constructed countless buildings in Khuzistan and have a wide ^experience of the requirements of the climate, as well as all facilities and material ready to their hand. I am confident thao if they were willing to give their services, the cost of construction could be very considerably reduced. 6. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Acting Britisn Consul at Ahwaz. (No. 45). I have, etc. , (Signed) R.H*Hoare.BRITISH CONSULATE, /'''n No. 30. AHWAZ. 18th June, 1932. Sir, I have the honour to lay before you the following facts concerning the accommodation of His Majesty*s Consular Officers at Ahwaz, for your earnest consideration thereon and such necessary action as you may deem fit. Early in 1S29 Mr. Vice-Consul Brenan, who was deputed to investigate the existing arrangements at Ahwaz and Mohammerah, reported as follows on the former 'The whole arrangement for the housing of these two officers (i.e. Consul and Vice-Consul) and the Consulate is disgracefully unsatisfactory and derogatory to the prestige of His Majesty’s Consular Officers'. (sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 310, dated 1st June, 1929). in a further despatch (No.372, dated 29th July 1930) His Majesty’s Minister states:- 'It will be seen how deplorable are the conditions in which His Majesty’s Consul and Vice-Consul are at present existing at Ahwaz and how absolutely necessary the construction forthwith of decent accommodacion if their prestige is to be maintained in this most important Consular district. Ahwaz is no more than a collection of insanitary hovels'. Whilst R. H. Hoare, Esquire, C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’ Minister, etc., etc., etc., Briuisn Legation, TEHERAN.—- ,r _ ' H 'IS'* ' Whilst the expression 'existing” is most appropriate that of 'deplorable' very inadequately describes the situation now, which has deteriorated beyond measure since the above despatch was written. The collapse of Mr. Consul Monypenny's former abode ( a typical Ahwaz mud^hovel) compelled him to seek the good offices ot a local landlord to construct him a small house on a patch of land belonging to the landlord. This site, situated on the Southern fringe of the town, lies dov/nwind to it and at a much lower level. Apart from the fact thau the whole vicinity is customarily used by the local inhabitants for unmentionable purposes, it is scarred and pitted with old borrow pits, disused water channels, mud ruins and the like. Stagnant wader abounds and the whole area is a vast and fertile breeding ground for mosquitos, flies and other pests, whilst the effluvia emanating from the ground call for more than ordinary courage or folly to face them. On this salubrious site the new building was erected. It is small, low roofed and airless and forms a veritable heat trap, the discomforts of wnich are in no way ameliorated by its being dependant for electrical current on an indifferent and un reliable local supply. The sanitary drainage system installed in the building has proved a failure from the outset and its many unremediable defects constitute a very serious danger to health. The bungalow is innocent of any accommodation for servants whilst th_ o 0 called kitchen consists of a filthy two roomed mud hovel built into the comppund wall. it is unprovided with either light,light, water or drainage and closely adjoins the very defective house drainage sump. Accommodation for servants being non-existent it would appear superfluous to add that no wash house or 'conveniences' are available for them. They are thus compelled to join the ranks of the local inhabitant on the outside of the compound walls when nature demands that they should do so. A roofed in angle of the compound wall serves as sa garage, which is otherwise unprovided with essentials or even a door. In wet weather the approach to this Consular domain is entirely cut off by deep mud and surface drainage water from the higher lying town. Mr. Consul Monypenny relates that he has been marooned in this house for as much as three days at a time during the rainy season. Personal experience of a light shower on the morning subsequent to my arrival entirely bears out this statement. A quarter of an hour’s rain converted the approaches to the 'bungalow' into an evil smelling quagmire, ankle deep. A week’s residence in this abode (hitherto unoccupied during the summer) convinced me that it would be courting disaster to attempt to continue in it for the hot weather. My decision was accelerated by losing two of my servants to hospital suffering from dysentery and throat trouble in spite of all possible precautions. Exploration of the Vice-Consul’s 'residence' as an alternative revealed the following:- (a) A room some 18 f x 8’, subdivided into three by thin walls had served in the past as kitchen, wash house and native 'convenience'. The latter, which is still used by menials, consists of the usual hole in the ground over a large cesspit, (the(the presence of which in the very confined area of the premises constitutes a sanitary menace at all times)# ^ (b) The late Vice-Consul, Captain Galloway, had removed his kitchen to an existing sardab (underground cellar) to which light and ventilation were afforded by an opening on to the street at ground level. It was the sight of a cholera striken victim vomiting immediately outside this opening which compelled Cantain Galloway to seek refuge with the Anglo-persian Oil Company during the violent cholera epidemic of 1931. (c) No accommodation exists for servants. (d) There is no safe garaging to be obtained within J mile. (e) The house is immediately accessible, via the contiguous flat roofs, to ones neighbours. Captain Galloway was burgled in this way (it is suspected by a Persian official:) last year. The whole appearance and air of this place, though slightly cleaner perhaps than that of the Consular residence, is squalid and depressing in the extreme and, in the light of Captain Galloway’s experience, it would have been madness to have contemplated a repetition of his plucky attempt 'to say nothing and carry on” in this house. In these circumstances and in the absence of any other accommodation, I had but two alternatives open to me - i.e. Either to desert my post or to beg assistance from the Anglo-Persian Oil Coy: Much against my inclinations and pocketing my shame, I adopted the latter course. ByBy the generosity of the Anglo-persian Oil Coy; H.B.M’s Consul is now at least sanitarily housed (if only in a very small junior married quarter) for the hot weather. The accommo dation is again only temporary for, as pointed out by the General Manager, Abadan, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company very naturally object on principle to housing those for whom accommo dation should be, but is not provided by Government, and the present favour is not likely to be renewed. It was mere human obligation that prompted the Anglo- persian Oil Company to take in Captain Galloway last year when he was left houseless in a cholera stricken town, but the constant repetition of such applications is both exasoerating to the Company, and derogatory and galling to Consular Officers. As regards the Consulate Offices, the existing arrangements would put one of the lesser known South American Republics to shame. The first thing that strikes the visitor on entering the narrow 'main entrance' (sic) is the overwhelming odour issuing from the native convenience - cum - cesspool which is built in the wall of the entrance passage of the Consulate. This passage gives on to a diminutive yard around which are huddled the various small rooms passing as the ofiices of the Consul and his clerical staff. No accommodation being provided for farashes the latter either squat in the sun or revert to the odoriferous entrance passage above referred to.- All concerned are called on to work under conditions of extreme discomfort and there is little doubt that any competent medical authority would condemn the entire arrange ment on sanitary grounds alone. ThereThere being no room available elsewhere, the majority of the Consulate records are stored in rickety and insecure A cupboards on the office verandah where they are exposed alike to the climate and to theft. The whole 'Consulate' is sordid, squalid and unhealthy and without exaggeration is a disgrace to the flag that flies on its roof. The three additional rooms, which are shortly being incorporated in the Consulate, will be untenable in the hot weather as they are contained in walls only one brick thick and will be exposed from midday onwards to the full force of the summer sun. Time does not permit of other than a passing reference to the Consulate furniture which is chiefly conspicuous by its absence. Such little as exists is thoroughly in keeping with the rest of the menage and would better grace a low class native cafd. That British prestige has suffered considerably through the hand-to-mouth methods and temporary makeshifts that have been the lot of H.B.M 1 s Consular Officers here for several years past, there is little doubt; and intimate conversations with more friendly Persian Officials fully confirm this opinion. It is under these distressing circumstances that I feel it my duty, although only a temporary incumbent of this post, to most respectfully represent the state of affairs prevailing at Ahwaz and to request that suitable and urgent action may be taken to impress on the Higher Authorities concerned the necessity for redeeming the situation without further unnecessary delay. AsAs regards possible sites for the new Consulate and Consular residence* From the trend of local affairs and information it would appear that the project of creating a new town on the right banA of the river is extremely distant, if not wholly nebulous. Examination of the sites likely to be available to us on that bank show them to be highly unsuitable and, owing to their low lying position, very heavy expenditure would be in volved in correcting ground levels before building operations could be commenced at all. Every thing points to the acquisition of what is known as the Sheikh’s site on the left bank of the Karun river. Prior to the receipt of your telegram No.14, dated 1st June, 1922, the Anglo-Persian Oil Compeny had already been approached with a view to obtaining the services of a trained surveyor to map this area. The site has now been surveyed but the prior claims of the Company have precluded the results of the I survey being put before me as yet although advance figures of measurements have been submitted* A reference is invited to the accompanying key sketch, which however is not to scale. The area W X Y - represents the residue of the originally proposed site after deducting the large slice appropriated by the Municipality for the TI National park” • For brevity this area will be henceforth referred to as area A. Area B is the further plot available as reported in my predecessor’s No.20/lll/l, dated 22nd April 1922. The line X 0 Y represents the eastern boundary wall of the original site. The local Persian Officials are most anxious that this wall be rebuilt at right angles to the road which /' At / 2J*Z) which is being driven along 'the line Z Y# This is in accordance with the present new layout of this area and is a request which I support* Should His Majesty*s Government acquire area B the wall 0 Y will be dismantled ipsofacto. Should area B not be acquired then it would appear desirable to rebuild the wall from point Y (as shown in red)* This will involve the acquisi tion of the small triangle 0 R Y, whose area, whilst almost neglible as a separate entity, would be extremely valuable to us when subsequent building operations are commenced* In order to square up the Consulate domain I would have strongly advocated the acquisition of the plot TI area C TT * The portion of the wall 0 X is very broken down* By pushing it back to 0 X the symmetry of the grounds would be vastly im proved at small additional expenditure, whilst the evils attendant on the erection of a jim-crack engine for the murieipal water suoply would be kept a little further at arm* s length* Unfortunately in the course of the last few days the Municipality have commenced laying underground pipes in this area so the proposal would appear to be impossible of accom plishment • As regards the actual building accommodation required, this will depend to a certain extent as to Eis Majesty's Government's proposals to establish a Consulate General here or not i.e. room for expansion if necessary must be allowed for* It is highly essential to concentrate in one place the various camp equipment godowns, stores, stables etc* which are dotted about the town at present under conditions which defy description. WhilstWhilst on paper area 7T A fT would appear to be sufficiently large to permit of this being done, the nature of the terrain very greatly reduces the area available for actual building purposes. The acquisition and employment of area 'B' would relieve what would otherwise be a most congested situation. I would therefore very strongly urge its acquisition whilst it is still available. There should be no difficulty in disposing of this area at a profit should it subsequently not be required, but at the same time I would invite the attention of the High Authorities to the danger (sanitary and otherwise) of having a local inhabitant as ones close neighbour. Area 'B' is to be surrounded eventually on three sides by streets. Its acquisition therefore would eliminate the above danger. Finally I would point out that local land values are soaring almost daily and that there are many eager aspirants to the areas under discussion. The exchange being considerably in our favour is a further valuable asset. Should any procrastination now take place I foresee that our opportunity will disappear for ever and the situation will become more than ever untenable. I have, etc., (Signed) C.E.U. BHEMMEB.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No.304 of July 1st regarding Consular accommodation at Ahwaz, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of a further despatch that I have received from Major Bremner, enclosing a number of photo graphs of the existing accommodation. 2. The state of affairs revealed by these photographs is such that no comment or elaboration by me is possible or necessary. 3. The phrase 'borrowed from the Yice-Consulate' in paragraph 10 (1) needs some explanation. When Mr. Monypenny took over the charge of the Consulate in 1925 from Major peel of the Indian Political Department, he took over with it the existing office furniture. Ever since then, he has been hoping from month to month, and finally from year to year, to hear that a start could be made with the building af a proper Consulate. He has constantly in consequence deferred making any request for the provision of new furniture by His Majesty's Office of Works; feeling that it could do the new furniture no good to be moved about from one temporary office to another and that the correct course was to wait until the new offices were ready and then to provide them with furniture specially adapted to their requirements. The same considerations aoply to the safes and the provision for the custody of confidential papers, with regard The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., Foreign Office.regard to which Major Bremner has addressed me separately. It is therefore the case that the whole of the office equipment, both the Consul's and the Vice-Consul's, is in effect borrowed from the G-overnment of India, and as the separate Vice-Consul's budget administered by the Government of India, contains no provision for furniture, the phrase ''borrowed from the Vice- Consulate' means in effect 'borrowed from the Government of India.' 4. With regard to paragraph 12, the accommodation referred to therein is indispensable for the storage of the Consulate Camp equipment etcetera, so that if the public Works Department do not propose to retain it any longer, I venture to suggest that His Majesty's Office of Works may be asked to continue to pay the rent until such time as the new Consulate is completed. I understand that the rent amounts to about rials two hundred a month. I should be grateful for a telegraphic reply on this point. 5. I need not trouble you at this point with the despatch referred to in paragraph 14. 6. In conclusion, I should like to add that Mr.Monypenny entirely endorses Major Bremner's strictures upon the present accommodation. I consider it greatly to his credit that although he has frequently drawn attention to the inadequacy of this accommodation and pressed for the construction of a proper Consulate, he should, in order to avoid expense to His Majesty's Government, have put up with this accommodation without much louder complaints. 7.

Sir, With reference to previous correspondence regarding the acquisition at Ahwaz of a site for the proposed construction of a Consulate and of residences for the Consular Officers at that post ending with a letter from this department £ 6847/670/234 of the 15th June, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit herewith, to be laid before the First Commissioner of His Majesty’s w orks and Public buildings copies of despatches and of a telegram dated the 22nd ultimo June was transmitted a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister in which Mr. Hoare reported that the site at Ahwaz, commonly known as the 'Sheikh's Site” has now become the property of the Muin-ut-Tujjar and that he would endeavour to ascertain definitely what price the Muin expected for the site. The accompanying copy of despatch No.304 from Mr. Hoare covers a copy of a despatch from the Acting British Consul at Ahwaz in which Major Bremner, after describing in detail the state of dilapidation and disgusting squalor of the existing office premises and residences, furnishes a sketch of the site in question and recommends the acquisition of the areas marked A and B. As will be seen from Mr. Hoare's telegram of the 22nd ultimo, areas A and B extending to thirty two thous-oid, ' eight hundred and twenty two square zars can be acquired from 'X from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. 2. With the letter from this department of the 15th the Muin at a special price of twelve rials a zar for a cash payment The Secretary to the Office of Works.payment of three hundred and ninety three thousand, eight hundred and sixty four rials which, having regard to the present tendency for local land values to increase rapidly is to he considered very reasonable. 3. In paragraph 3 of his accompanying despatch, Mr. Hoare puts forward the reasons which render necessary the acquisition of area B as well as area A. Sir John Simon is in full agreement with the views of His Majesty's Minister and having regard to the utterly deplorable conditions under which Consular Officers at Ahwaz at present live and work, is convinced of the vital importance of seizing the present opportunity to acquire as suitable a site as will ever be available in the near future. He has no doubt that Mr. Ormsby-Gore will share his opinion and trusts that in these circumstances immediate sanction may be given for His Majesty's Minister at Tehran to conclude the purchase of the proposed site at a price not exceeding four thousand pounds. 4. A very early reply to this letter will be appreciated. 5. Sir John Simon trusts that when this site has been acquired arrangements will be made for the construction thereon without delay by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company of suitable office premises, a residence for His Majesty's Consul and quarters for the native servants. It will be observed from paragraph 3 of Mr. Hoare's despatch No.304 that it may be necessary later on to erect a residence for the Vice-Consul also. Furthermore, since the office equipment and furniture in use at the existing Consulate appears to be the property of the Government of India, suitable provision will have to be made for supplying the new■ 'K 8747/670/234 FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 3rd August, 1932. Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to state for the information of the Lords Comrais si oners of His Majesty's Treasury that His Majesty's Minister at Tehran understands that the Public Works Department, Bushire who are disposing of their materials at Ahwaz have warned the Consulate at that nlace that they are also dispensing with a yard attached to the Consulate, hitherto leased by them, and will therefore have to discontinue the privilege afforded His Majesty's Consul of using this yard where the Consular Camp Equipment and officers personal kit is stored and where the office farrashes live in straw mat shelters and a cowshed. 2. Mr. Hoare states that the use of this yard for the above purposes is indispensable while the projected consular buil ding remains unbuilt. Sir John Simon is in full agreement with this view and trusts that in these circumstances Their Lordships may be moved to sanction the lease of the yard in question by His Majesty's Consulate at Ahwaz if and when it is given up by the Public Works Department, Bushire. The rent of the yard is understood to amount to about two hundred rials a month. 3. I am to add that it is hoped to acquire shortly a suitable site for the construction of the new Consular premises at Ahwaz and to arrange for the building to be set on foot without delay. 4.

I am accordingly to suggest without prejudice and without admission of le^al liability that in order to arrive at an amicable settlement,, and to dispose of the whole matter finally, the sale proceeds of all the materials should be divided in the ratio of the expenditure incurred respectively oy the Sheikh and the Government up to the time the materials are completely sold and the godowns are released.

With reference to paragraph 3 of your letter referred to above, I am to invite attention to the Poruign and Political Department express letter to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No.P. 360-A/31 , dated the 6th January 1932, a copy of which was sent to tne India Office with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter No.2-M, dated the 7th January 1932, from which it will be noticed that orders for the disposal of the materials have already been issued. Instructions are being issued to the Political Resident that the sale proceeds should be held in suspense pending a decision as to their disposal- I have the honour to be.

Corernor and the Municipality have recently however ap roved of a echame for the eidening and continuation of a road which exists between the Consulate site and the adjoining public garden. If this scheme ia carried out the area of the Consulate site which ia above flood level and ia suitable for building will be reduced and the foundations of one of the buildings ( the Consult house) will be destroyed. The total area of the site will be reduced to about £6,500 &amp;q. yards of which about h&amp;lf is above the highest flood level.

This plot of land would ha/e not river frontage but would be suitable for the construction of an office! ser/ants quarters etc. The proposed new boundaries of the Consulate eite are marked in red ink on the sketch. The total area is about 33,000 square yards of which t^o thirds at least should be suitable for building purposes. I beg to point out that the ground in question appear© of largo extent in comparison for ineUsnoo with the plot of ground on which the Anglo ?ersien Oil Company No•1 Bungalow is built but much of the latter ground was filled in with earth and raised above flood level whereas a considerable portion of the Consulate site is low lying and liable to flood.

Bear Scott, Jones, our Architect, has returned from his trip to Ahwaz and we now have a good deal of the information we require if the building scheme is to go on. It is clear that the sheikh's site is still the best one for a Consulate, though the adjoining site, if slightly less suitable, would also serve. We ought to have, however, a more accurate figure as regards the price asked for the land. Having regard to the present position I imagine that no useful purpose would be served by pressing the scheme too far forward. Am I right in thinking that the Consul has security for several years both as regards a residence and an office? I see from an India Office paper that there is some suggestion of doing away with the Vice-Consul. Are the Foreign Office likely to agree to this? Yours sincerely, (Signed) E. BE NORMANN. B.J.

We understand that the Consul is able to count on security of tenure for both office and residence for a few years but it is perhaps unnecessary to repeat how unsatisfactory the private accommodation is. As regards the suggestion to do away with the Vice Consul I cannot safely give you an assurance as to what our final decision will be.
