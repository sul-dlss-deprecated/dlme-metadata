I — ; _ Many thanks for your D.O.No.1032-1/13 dated the 28th May 1940. I have not been able to answer it before, not because I have been idle about it, but because tentage is just about the most difficult thing to acquire in India today as you can imagine. I got into touch with Pinhey who has given me the following infonnation wnich appears to be correct and to be the best possible arrangement that can be made Howes is apparently getting his family out from Home and proposes to leave them in Ziarat when he returns to Muscat. He is himself, at the moment, living on the camp site which you hope to occupy later. There is, I gather, no other site available in Ziarat; so it seems that, willy-nilly, you will have to share the site with the Howes i family. This will solve the question of a dining room tent since he has one already and will be leaving it for their use. Pinhey has very kindly offered to lend you two shouldaries for the use of your servants. This appears to be the only possible arrangement. I have noted regarding your two new tents and when they turn up in Quetta, I will send them on to Ziarat. I am afraid we shall not be in Quetta when you arrive as we hope to go up to Ziarat on 1st July for a month but it will be delightful to see you again and meet your wife there.

Since writing to you, Howes came to see me and told me that he had telegraphed to you the fact that his wife was unable to get a passage from England and that he will be able to leave you tentage in Ziarat. He suggests, however, that you should not cancel the offer of Pinhey of 2 shouldaries for servants as he, Howes, says that li he himself can leave one shouLdari behind. A I have noted regarding tents from Cawnpore and should they arrive inspite of your telegram to the Elgin Mills, I can easily have them stored in the Police Lines until you return to Bahrein.
