It ie quite true that etrietly speaking the aietter should in the first instance have been brought to the notice of his Majesty’s Government by the rer&amp;ian Legation here. In practice, however, the Legation do practic- lly no tiling, and knowing what we do of the inefficiency of their whole organisation, we do not want to suggest that there should be any change in our present practice of transacting all serious bueinets exclusively through our Legation at Teoran. If we were to maxe an exce tion in even so unimportant a case as the Oiun,1i claim, theru is a risk that the i ersian Government might be encouraged thereby to use their Legation for more important business, and the result would almost certainly be V.A.L.

Dear Mr. Laithwaite, On the day that I saw you in last August, I called at the office of Mr. Khunji’s lawyers at the time that had been arranged. by a young man who informed me that he wa ®, ia ® t ™ cted to discuss the matter of tne ice plant with me on behalf of the firm. He appeared to know about the case and had some letters and notes on the subject. After some conversation, I told him that in order to close the matter finally and to prevent its causing further trouble to various people and Government departments we were willing to settle as follows. 1. H. E. Shaikn Hamad will waive his claim for half the ground and half the building which contained the machine. 2. The Municipality will pay to Mr. Khunji jjo t A&amp;n/— whi is one h.8.if of tbe profits from tne year when both machines were used by the Mmicipality •d We will not demand any examination of old accounts- all this on the condition that the dispute shall b®*considered to be finally closed, neither party after this settlement having any claim against bhe other party. Mr. Khunii’s representative made a note of t ne conversation and assured me that he would communicate inimpdiatelv with his principal who was in Paris. Hold him that I was leaving England m a few days andand I gave him my address. I heard nothing from him before leaving England and I have heard nothing from him since. Even if Mr. Khunji did not agree to my sug gestions it would have been more courteous to nave informed me. In order to settle the affair we are still willing to close the matter on the terms which I have mentioned above. Yours sincerely, 3. Laithwaite. Esqr., The India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.l.n J The Shaikh iLaad-K 9 Khimji Ice Plant. &lt; V**-*Jtd , a'iA'vA. (a) On the 9th June 1920 a monopoly was granted to Mr.Yusif Lutufali Khunji for the manufacture of ice for a term o£ 5 years.commencing from the 1st July; the monopoly v/as to cease automatically at the end of that period unless renewed before its expiry. Some delay arose in the shipping of the machinery and the date of the monopoly was subsequently altered to commence from the 1st April 1921. Shaikh Hamad had now apparently become a partner. On the 12th November 1925 Mr. Khunji applied from Bombay for an extension of the monopoly for a further period of 5 years and he v/as informed that the extension could not be granted. 2. The case was reopened in August 1930 by Mr.Khunji,now apparently residing in Ongland,v/ith a letter to the Political * Agent,of which I give a copy. A very important point will be noticed in this letter and that is where he says T I entered into a partnership agreement with Shaikh Hamad al Khalifa whereby we took over a factory and the machines therein for ice making*. It will be noticed that the factory was taken over by them jointly. This point will be referred to again later. Shortly after his letter to the Political Agent Mr. Khunji had written to the Municipality,and the Adviser wrote to the Agency on the Arabic date equivalent to the 20th September 1930 dealing with Mr.Khunji T s claim and enclosing a copy of Mr.Khunji f s letter to the Municipality. I give copies of both of these letters. In the letter of the 2Tiid August 1930 to the Municipality it will be noticed that Mr. Khunji expressly states that the land and well adjoining the factory are his personal property,but makes no\ mention of the factory building itself. 3. It will be seen that Mr .Khunj i * s agent himself suggested a dissolution of the partnership on the 5th Safar 1349 (1st July 1930) and on the 11th Safar Shaikh Hamad’s share was offered to Mr.Khunji for Rs.10,,000 with a five year monopoly and a- 2 - Cl^eX-crvvuvJU-'^i o 1 L Ol } y\ 0- v'A-o Ne «^S-4^o V&gt;y/, and a monopoly rent of Rs.500 per annum, in other words approximately the same terms ^diich the unicipality finally acquired the share. Mr.Khunji refused this offer. It is interestii^ to notice that he estimated that the profits for one year would not amount to Rs.500,whereas the Municipal ity, however, cleared over Rs.3,500 in two months when they finally took over^ selling ice at Annas 1 a lb instead of Annas 3 or 4 a lb. 4. Shaikh Hamad finally sold his share to the Municipality and the Manama Municipality now informed Mr.Khunji that they had purchased Shaikh Kamad* T s share in the ice plant,and had obtained the sole right to manufacture ice for sale for 5 years and they definitely refused his offer to buy their half share for Rs.10,000. They also refused Mr.Khunji 1 s offer to sell his share for Rs.30,000 and reminded him that he had had an opportunity of purchasing the plant but had not accepted it. The new monopoly granted to the Manama Municipality was for 5 years. It was not transferable and precluded any other concern from manufacturing ice for sale within the Bahrain Islands for a space of 5 years,with the exception of any plant erected outside the boundaries of the Manama Municipality by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 5. I was absent in India when these letters v/ere received, but I went into the matter on my return and finally wrote to Mr.Khunji on the 9th December 1930 saying that if he had any claims against Shaikh Hamad they would be sent to the Joint Court and I info me d him that his fear of being obliged to take the Municipality as a partner was unfounded as they intended to remove the engine and take' it to another site. 6. Messrs Hall,Brydon and Chapman, solicitors to Mr. Khunji, X now entered tho field and in their letter of Hie 31st October 1930, they wurote to me stating that nig; neither they nor their client could underfctand how the Municipality could have beenr~- Ik^LA. &gt;*tjM440 fV* &amp;Jyryf\/i\ . / CSP -3- granted a monopolyjiior how ohaildi Hamad could have sold his share of the plant without the consent of their client,and at the same time granted a monopoly which prohibited their client from carrying on the business which he had established for 8 years. They asked me to act on behalf of their client and to ’take such steps as may be necessary to protect his interests’. L’hey also enclosed a copy of their client's letter dated the 2Hnd August 1930 to the I unicipality and the tomicipality’s reply which have already been noticed above. 7. in I replied to Mr.Khunji’s solicitors saying that since the matter mi^it come before me in my judicial capacity I could not offer any comment on their client’s legal position, but I pointed out that since their client admitted having enjoyed a monopoly at the hands of the Bahrain Government for 5 years,he could not now deny their right to grant such mono polies. . I confirmed the statement that their client would not now be able to produce ice in Bali rain but added that there was nothing to prevent him removing his share of the ice plant to the mainland or any other place he might asiksE chose. I also informed them that the Municipality would pay the half ska share of the onmings for the summer of 1930 upon demand but that they had no intention of working the plant in conjunction with him. 8. The Adviser now informed me that the Municipality wished to remove their half of the machinery from the ice factory and erect it at the lower House and said that Mr.Khunji’s vakil had been instructed by his principal not to act any longer with regard to the ice machine. I suggested to the Municipal ity that it would be advisable to give Mr.Khunji ample notice of their intention and also to give him the choice of the machines,so that he oould not later say he was given the inferior one. This notice was sent and the division of the machines was amicably carried out later. The factory itself was not divided up and is still in dispute.-4- ® &lt;( ra ' v-vX 9. I now received a letter dated the 30th January 1931 from Mr.Xhunji*s solicitors infori:ing me that they had 'been in communication with the India Office,and that from the infom- aticn they had recei ved it appeared that the position was not # quite as set out in my letter (of 32nd November 1930} aad they added that they .entirely failed to appreciate iay statement that the Joint Court 'decides such cases according to local custom 1 . 'they algo stated that it would be inequitable after a person had been exercising his business for some time that he should be deprived of the right to carry it on ’without any other A- neason than apparently caprice or whim of some one claiming to have a ri^it’. They also stated that the Municipality had committed an actionable wrong by entering thei'r client’s premises and working his plant without his consent* A copy of this letter was forwarded to the Hon’hle the Political Resident* At the same time the solicitors wrote to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and informed him that neither under the Order in Council or Indian Law was there any authority enabling him to grant a monopoly to the Manama Municipality and asked him to get into touch with the Municipality and get the matter adjusted according to their respective rights* Failing this, they said,their client would have no alternative but to take all necessary steps to protect his interests. 10. I replied to this in my letter Ho:404- dated the 23rd March 1931, of which a copy was sent to the Secretary at Bushire and the Adviser to the Bahrain G-overnment. In this letter I declined to enter into an argummt as to what constituted ’local customs’,but pointed out that the Shaikh required no authority of an Order in Council or Indian Law to grant mono polies as it was inherent in his sovereign power. (q) 11. In another letter dated the 28th March 1931,the solicitors informed me that unless I would attend to their client’s interests they proposed to communicate with the India^f Office, asking then to take it up officially. I pointed out that their-5- f^) letter had crossed my No:404 of the 33rd March end said that the differences between their client tnd the huler ox Bahrain apjj eared to have been arr^Janed but that if they had any tiling further to say they should inform me of it in due course. I was under the impression that the division of the plant and machinery settled everything,but this was not hr•Khunji ? s view of the case. The solicitors replied in their letter of the 10th June 1931 that the settlement referred only to the division of the machinery and that there still remained the right of their client to work his machinery. They also said that their client’s agent was makirg a demand for the amount due to him on the last summer’s earnings,i.e. ,1930,together with a demand for certain monies due to him.. The ’certain monies’ were the amount of expenses which will be referred to later. This is the first mention of them. I replied on the 37th June that their client’s agent had applied to me to co me nee operations with his ice plant but that I had referred him to the .adviser to the ’ovemmarit of iuin^and I said I would be glad to give him my good offices as far as possible in assisting him to recover the amounts due. Apart from this, the agent does not appear,however,to have approached the A ency and I believe at about this time ceased representing Mr.Khunji altogeth er• * 12. A copy of a letter from the ier sian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to his Majesty’s Minister in Teheran,couched in the most extraordinary terms was now sent me with Bush ire Endorse ment No:2315 dated the 11th November 1931 for report. I sent this to the Adviser and asked to be informed what had trans pired since his last caianunication to me. The Adviser replied that the accusations hich had been made against His Bxceilancy Shaikh-Ham&amp;d in such undignified,inaecurate and peculiar terms were ent^iely devoid of truth. He pointed out that since he came to Bahrain some 6 years beforehand for several years % before his arrival, ShaiAh Hamad had received no profits from (By}from the partnership and until he advised him to withdraw from participation he used annually to pay considerable sums into the concern for which he received no return. The Adviser added that the machinery had been amicably divided between the two parties and that they had signed an agreement stating t-hat ea-ch had received his full share. Two matters remained j outstanding: (i) the division of the actual land and buildings. ' ii) payment oi half the total profits made by the Municipality during the one year they had worked tne machines. The half of the total profits amounted to slightly under Rs.2,000 being actually Rs.1,880. He claimed that half the building was the property of Shaikh Hamad and said that Shaikh Hamad T s claim on half the building might be set off against the half of the profits which were due to Ir.Khunii for the summer in which the Municipality worked the machine before the division was made. 13. On the 13th November 1931 the solicitors sent me another letter saying they were surprised to find that their client had been refused permission to commence operations with the ice plant and that their client ! s agent had been told by the Adviser that he would not receive the half profits for 1930 Unless he produced the accounts of the partnership up to the year 1926. They stated that T each and every account during the partnership has been furnished from time to time, and any profit or loss has year by year been paid or allowed’. They also stated that it was 5 years since the partnership had expired and that they would he obliged if I v/ould see the Adviser and obtain the amount due from him. The Adviser.to whom I sent a copy of this letter^sent Mr. Khun j i a reply in which he stated that half the building was owned by Shaikh Hamad and he suggested that its value should be assessed and w when this was known arrangements could he made for the division. He admitted that half the profits of 1349 (1930)-7~ were due to r.Khiaiji but suggetited that M).is ginount should he set off against Shaikh Hamad’s share of the building. 14. The solicitor’s now sent me a copj^ of their letter to the Mv.ser dated the 12th January 1932. This is of little interest arid recapitulates the demand for the payment cf Fs.2,435/14/9,(i.8.,Rs.1,880 for half profits and Fs.555/14/9 for expenses incurred in 1348 and 1349),also saying that they could not understand why the accounts were asked for. They added that their client ’did not agree that Shaikh Hamd had any right whatever in the building and in any event was not prepared to discuss the matter unless his present claims were satisfied’. 15. I now received the Secretary’s Endorsement TT o:209 d.ated the 29th January 1932 forwarding certain letters from the India Office to the Foreign Office and from the Foreign Office to the India Office. In the first No:Z.7030/31 dated the 4th December 1931 from the India Office to the Foreign Office it is noted in Paragraph 3 that hr.Khunji had admitted that he had refused His Excellency Shaikh Hamad’s original offer to sell him his share on the same terras as those offered to the Municipality. I am glad this point has been noted as it is important. On the 27th February 1932 in my No:244 I reported on the situation and pointed out,as mentioned by the Adviser, that there only remained the question of the building and payment of half the total profits made by the Municipality during the year they worked the plant,which,I said,amounted to some Rs.2000. Actually I believe they amounted to p s.1,880. 16. Later I addressed the Adviser again and asked whether the situation had altered in any way. He replied stating that he had suggested to I'r.Khunji’s solicitors that Shaikh Hamad’s claim to half the premises of the factory should be set off against half the profits due to Mr.Khunji and that they had replied denying that Shaikh Hamad had any right to a share in the building. They admit ted, however, that their claim for the-8~ maciiinory was settled according to the division which had taken place hetween thair Bahrain agent and the hxinicipality, hut at the same ti-ne they demanded payment of Rs*2,435/14/9. The Adviser pressed for the production of the accounts of the initial cost of the enterprise.,as these would show that Shaikh Hamad paid half the cost of erecting the building in which the m. chinery was lodged. The building is said to have cost some Rs.20,000. 17. With regard to the claim for As.2,435/14/9. He admitted that Rs.1,880 was due to M.r Khnnji being half the total profits for the part of 1349 (1930) during which period both the machines were worked by the Municipality. In addition to this,he sald,Ar. Kh un j i o lai med p ay men t of R s. 555/14/9 for hal f costs (i.e. je^enses) incurred by him during 1340 until the end of the 1349 season, such as pay of an engineer previously em loyed by hirn and retained by him.,rent of certain shops previously used as ice stores and cost of oil end ammonia purchased by him before the period in which the Municipality worked the machine. None of these liabilities were admitted., since they were all incurred by Mr. Khunji on his own authority x xiicUiC J. ul alone, during the period Sheikh Ahmed took no/interest in the concern. The Adviser stated that the sum of Rs.1880/- was on. deposit and would be paid as soon as their claim to half the building was settled. He added that this could easily be ascertained by the production of the original accounts end that it was useless his approaching Mr. Khunji f s agent as he could only act after consulting his principal vd ; ich took an inordinate tine. This is how the matter stands at the present moment, unless Mr. Belgrave has come to any arrangement with Mr. Khunji f s solicitors in England. 13. It will be seen that Mr.Khunji has claimed at various t ii.ie s: - r (i) that Shaikh Hamad had no right to sell his share in the partnership.(ii) that he had no right to give the Municipality the monopoly. (ill) that Shaikh Sailed iu not entitled to half the building of the factory but only to the plant and machinery. (iv) tlie half profits; for 1349 (1930). (?) certain jxtra expenses incurred by him on his own half of the plant during- the years 1348 and 1349. 19. As regards Shaikh hhroad^ disposal of his share of the partnership. It will be seen that in tlieir letter of the 13th November 1931 to this ..gemey the solicitors state that the partnership had actually expired some ^ years before. I believe Mr. Chun ji has dropped this point. It will be noticed, on pjisssnij that ’'dteror.s r. Oxmnjils local BgS&amp;t always showed Shaikh s share of the partnership as a substantial loss, the Municipality cleared Bs.3,750 in two montiis while selling far better ice ab one anna a pound instead of lumas 3 or 4. Secondly,the right of the Shaikh or the Bahrain Government to grant a monopoly is so clear that it requires no comment. Mr.Khunji himself enjoyed a monopoly for 5 years and is clearly estopped denying the State’s authority to grant it. It was offered to i r.fhunji and refused by him as he demanded a ten year monopoly. Thirdly,it will be noticed that in his original letters to me,Mr.Khunji stated that he entered into a partnership agreement with Shaikh Nanud ’whereby we took over a factory for ice making on the terms that each of us was to put into the partnership the same amount of capital ana profits or losses were to be divided eaually 7 . file other landed property is not mentioned in this and wore evidently net included in the property. Again in his letter to pue kunicipality he says T I am informed timt Shaihli ; r .smu d al xlu-lifa lias sold to you i.ia share in cur ice iuv*.*. ii-i.^ luc tory in Soil nun' and later T i am advised that in lav you have no rigit to enter the factory premises without my consent and jovl must certainly understand that the land adjoining the factory and the well which is the source of the water supply is my personal property and hascS) - 10 - ziiY-iT 1)0611 partnersM x &gt; property’. It wuld appear from these lv/o statements that the huildinr of the factory was the joint property of the partners. There seems no reason why Mr.Khunji \ should object to produce the accounts regarding the foundation of the factory. Fourthly,ns regards the half share of the profits for 134° (1930). The State have this amount on deposit and are willing to pay it as soon as the ovaership of the building is decided, ' hereas i'r.Khunji estimated a year's profits at about Fs.500 his half share amounts to Hs.1,880 on two months working. 'fifthly.the .Idviser states the ormenses incurred by Hr. Dantj 1 ? s ?,gQnt m 134&lt;: and 1349 were Incv^red entirely on his ov»d initiative^ krd that they cannot accept uny liability for them&amp;s they Vvero inenrred at a time wheri ohaiidi Ka.ad took no financial interest in the concern and before the Municipal ity worked the niachine. 20* The above is a review of the case as it appears from my files,but obviously since Mr.^unU and his solicitors have communicated vnth so many persons end since his agent has resigned end boon reinstated more than once,it is impossible to say that it is exhaustive. I believe,however,that it cJX torches on points of importance. To conclude:- (V . The \dviser admits that 3s .1,330-being .half the ' ' total profits of 1930 is due to fir.Khunji but # declines to oay It over until Shaikh Hamad’s claim to half the 'factory building is settled.

CsH) C-G-PRioZ Political ..gout,Bahrain.Copy ot a letter oated tue 15tn August 1930 Irom Mr* Yusuf Lutfally Khonji, 95 St. Andrews Road Nortn, St. Annes- on-Sea, Lancs, to His Britauiic ifcjesty’s Political,Agent, Bahrain. I should oe pleased if you would advise me of my position in tne iallowing circumstances - About 8 years ago I entered into a partnersnip agreement witn Shaikh Hamaa Al Khalifa wnereoy we tooK over a Factory and tne raacnines tnerein for Ice making-on tne terms tnat eacn ( of us was lo put into tne partnersnip tne same amount of capital, ana profits or losses were to oe divided equally. For about b years tnis arrangement was carried out, but at me end of tnat time it was agreed between Shaikh Hamad and myself that I should continue to carry on the business and alone be responsible for any losses or taice over any profits. Last year I was iniormed by Shaikh Hamad tnat ne desired our partnership to be dissolved, and I understand that tne matter came before you and you decided that Shaikh Hamad should be at liberty to take away one of tne ice making machines. This decision was never acted upon and it was arranged tnat I should continue tne business upon the same terms as previously. In the early part of July of this year I received a telegram from Shaikh Hamad informing me that the Municipality at Bahrain nad offered to him 10,000 rupees lor nis snare in our partnersnip witn a Royalty of 500 rupees lor 5 years subject to a monopoly being given to them for tnat period and Shaikh Hamad ofiered to allow me to purchase nis snare upon tne same terms. This I reiused, but made an offer containing certain otner terms and after several communications I received a letter from the office of the Adviser to tne Government ai Bahrain making certain suggestions and informing me tnat ii no reply was received in 10 days Shaikh Hamad would sell nis snare to tne Municipality, and would grant tnem tne 5 years monopoly. I wired in reply to tnis letter on tne oth August, but on tne 11th of August received a cable from my agent informing me tnat Shaikhm i ShaiJch Hamad nad sold to tne Municipality. It would, tiiereiore, appear that I am the owner oi a naif snare in the Ice making Factory and the Municipality is tne owner of the other naif snare. I am, nowever, advised mat according to English law I cannot De compelled io’ accept tne Municipality as my partner, and if the matter were in English Courts I should oe entitled to apply for tne partnership to be dissolvec and the assets realised and distriouted between the partners. I am not prepared to accept tne Municipality as my partner but I would oe prepared either to purchase tneir snare from them or to dispose oi my snare to them upon satisiactory terms being arranged. I, therefore, wish to imow what my remedy is. Will you please inform me what my position is and whether I can obtain tne same relief in Bahrain as I could if the matter were^ before the English Courts. If so, will you please let me Know what procedure should be followed.Copy of a memorandum No*585 8-F* of 1349 dated the 3?th R/Thany, 1349(20th September 1930) from the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain, to H.B«M T s Political Agent, Bahrain. Ice Factory. Owing to a letter which has oeen received irom Mr.Yusuf Khonji, of Manchester, a Persian merchant with interests in Bahrain who owns one naif snare in tne ice factory oi which tne other half snare was owned oy H*E« Shaiioi Hamad and sold by him to the Manama Municipality, it appears that this person proposes filing a case against H*E. Shaiioi Hamad. -I therefore wish to acquaint you with the particulars of the negociations leading up to the sale. About ten years ago Yusuf Khonji obtained the sanction of the Hon T ble trie Politics! Resident in tne Gulf to import an ice plant into Banrain, in partnership with H*E. Shaixh Hamad, both parties owning an equal snare. H*E* ShaiKh Hamad informs me that he paid between iis.30,000/- and Rs.40,000/- for nis naif share- 'tfStet. Yusuf Khonji presumably paid a similar sum. H.E. Shaikh Hamad informs me that no deed of partnership was ever drawn up or signed but ail arrangements were verbal. The arrangement appears to nave been tnat each party should xxxi share equally in profits or losses, eacn owning a naif interest in tne concern. The machinery, consisting of two Rustom Hornsby engines and two complete ice aaking outfits, was put in a stone building on the edge of a garden owned by Yusuf Khonji some distance outside Manama town* The site ox tne factory was included in tne partnership, also tne buildings out not tne garden. Water was obtained from a very dirty well also m tne garden, the water was very bracjcisn. In 1921, Mr. Khonji was granted a five years sole monopoly to make ice. It expired in 1926 and was not renewed. For tne first two or tnree Jears H.E« Shaikh Hamad(J 5 ) received a iew tnousana Rupees proiit irom ms snare. jut again I am imaDie to und any record or accounts. I gather tnat ne left tne management oi‘ tne concern entirely to lusui Khon 3 i ? s agent. H.E. ShaiKh Hamad informs me tnat on various occasions he was asiiea to pay large sums of money for spare parts etc. wnich ne invariably paid. In 1927 ana 1926, acting on my advice, H*S. SbaiKh Hamad allowed tne agent to run one machine nimself, retaining whatever profits ne could make and not demanding any payments from His Excellency. During these two years, with tne knowledge of tne agent, attempts were made to sell tne whole concern. A linn of engineers in Basrah were approached, also Mespers oi Bahrain and tne machinery was examined oy several peoplej all attempts to sell completely failed. The price of the ice at times reached four Annas the pound, it was dirty and ol bad quality, though the Medical Officer was said to inspect it at intervals. There were many complaints by the public. In 1928 conversations took place between tne agent and myseli on behalf oi H.E. Shaikh Hamad with a view to His Excellency selling ms half share. Finally H*E. shaikh namad wrote to the President oi tne Manama Municipality asking that tl the Municipality snould act for nim in the matter oi tne ice plant with due regard to his own interests and those ox tne public. The agent disliked this suggestion and after some negociations ne was allowed to run tne xactory himsell, using one nail of it as before. The unsatisfactory quality and the high price oi tne ice was discussed oy tne Munipipal Council. At one time, before 1930, it was suggested to H.E. Shaikh Hamad that he should sell ms share to Yusuf Khonji for Hs.10,00 but he considered the amount too low. Negociations were resumed before the beginning of tne summersummer season of 1930* I had several discussions with the agent as to nis ouying His Excellency’s share, but no agreement ‘ was arrived at# On 5th Safar, 1349 the agent wrote suggesting tnat some arrangenient should be made ior dividing tue macnine sjici .. ^ . xxsz3 each party taking nis share, in lact a dissolution ol the partnership. H.E. Shaikh Hamad then decided to olfer nis share in the concern to the jklanama Municipality subject to Yusuf Khonji not agreeing to ouy it on nis terms# The matter was discussed with tne Municipality and a telegram was sent to Yusuf Khonji on 11th Safar offering nim H#E# Shaikh Hamad’s snare lor Hs. 10,000/- with a five years monopoly for making ice and a monopoly rent of Rs#500/- per annum# OnCth July, 12th Safar, Yusuf Khonji replied oy telegram saying ne was sorry ne could not agree to particulars but was sending best offer oy Air Mail# He also stated tnat it was unnecessary to stop working and asxed permission to woric till terms were arrived at# On 14th Safar another telegram was sent to Yusuf Khonji granting nim permission to work the lactory lor one month pending sale. The agent was notiiied oi tnis. The agent replied tnat one month’s permission was useless. He asked to be allowed to work it for the whole season. Yusuf Khonji’s letter tnen arrived in wnich he acknowledge -d telegram giving particulars of the offer to Municipality# He stated tnat tne price was too nigh owing to age of tne machine and reduction in cost of such engines and tne present economic depression and small local consumption# Also a live years monopoly was a very short one, and tne Rs.500/- per annum rent extremely nign. He stated that tne profits of one year, such as this year might not amount to Rs.500/-. He definitely offered to purchase it for Rs# 10,000/- payable by half yearly instalments of Rs.2500/-, if ne was given a ten years monopoly and definitely stated tnat ne would never agree unless ne was given a ten years monopoly from January 1931. Further ne agrsiagreed to rent of its.250/- only for monopoly, or one tentn of profits as an annual tax. In fact iie definitely refused the terms which were offered. Failing agreement ne suggested dissolving tne partnersiiip* He claimed he had a rignt to work the machine according to a case in the Agency Court last year ai 1 and claimed damages from its being closed down. He said tnat he was prepared to dissolve partnership' or to sell nis share x J in the factory, but without nis garden, to the Beladiya ' or continuation oi partnership# The Baladiya were asked to call a special meeting to discuss the question# On 2nd iiabi/ Al Awwal a letter was written to Yusuf Khonji T s agent giving tne iallowing alternatives:- 1# Either Yusuf Khonji to sell nis half to tne Baladiya on the terms oifered by the Baladiya to H#E# Shaiidi iiamad, wind were enclosed, i.e. Bs.10,000/- to be paid in instalments of 11s.2000/- per annum. 2. Yusuf Khonji and the Baladiya to work in partnership and to hold a monopoly for five years,( the monopoly being granted oy the Government). 3. Yusuf Khonji to buy share oi ShaiKh Hamad xor Rs. 10,000/- but witn no guarantee of being granted a monopoly. If no reply received in ten days H.E. Shaiicn Hamad would sell nis snare to tne Baladiya ana grant them tne live years monopoly. In no case would a ten years monopoly be possible. The agent replied that he had sent the letter by Air Mail to Yusuf Khonji. In tne meantime, in the interests of tne public, tne Baladiya was instructed by Shaikh Hamad to open the lactory and commence the supply of ice. This was done and from that time until now a plentiful cheap supply of ice has been available, made with clean water and sold at about a quarter of tne previous price. The trade showed a very handsome profit indee Eleven days alter the sending oi tne letter to Yusuf KhonjiKkonji his reply ms not yet received and the Manama Municipality were iniorwed that H.E* Sh&amp;iKh iiataad's nail share in the factory was now theirs. The next day Yusuf Khonji’s reply arrived, two days late, saying tnat he would ouy H.E* Shaum Hamad's share. It was considered invalid. The agent was iniormed oi this. Since tnen Shaiich Hamad nas received a lurtner letter of complaint oy Yusui Khonji. It is tne intention of tne Baladiya to remove their half of the machine to a place adjoining the Power House and to insert a small electric engine at tne end of the present season* The Baladiya are now working both engines and propose paying Yusuf Khonji half of the profits at the end of this summer, out in tne future the Baladiya alone have the right to manufacture ice, for five years, so unless Yusuf Khonji sells his naif to them it will be of no use to nimronv of a/letter dated tki* i&amp;nd August, 1930, irom iir. : Lu^fally Khonji, 95 St.Andrews Hoad Nortn, St. Anaes-on- ea to xJie .\uiiicipality at Bahrain. 1 am informea that ShaiKh Hamad Al Khalna nas sold to you nis snare in our Ice-making Factory at Bahrain and that ne nas handed to you the Jteys of the Factory and you are now in possess- -ion and wonting tne plant and machinery ior your own use.

Prior, I,A Political Agent, Bahrain, *************** Be. Khoali- We have to refer to your letter of the 22 nd Iasi Upon receipt thereof we communicated with the Under Secretary of State for India and enclose you copy of the reply we received, Prom this and the matter to which reference is there made it would appear that the position is not auite as set out in your letter. Icu will see from the letter from the India Office it is open to our client to bring a suit under the provisions of article 45 of the Bahrain Order in Council of 1913, and, as no doubt you are aware , that Order as amended by King # s Beg. Nc.l of 1924 sets cut the Indian Acts applicable in Bahrain. We entirely fail to appreciate your statement that the Joint Court 'decides such oases according to local custom'. According to cur instructions when the monopoly was granted to our client at the commencement of his business, it was because there was no other ice-making Paotcry on the Island at that time and the monopoly was granted to allow him to establish the business. Ihe present circumstances are essentially different and there appears to be no authority under the Order in Council or Indian Law which would permit or authorise anyone to grant a monopoly as would have the effect of preventing our client from continuing to work his -Factory if he should so desire# You will, we are sure, appreciate before a custom can possibly exist there would certainly require to have been a number of acts, matters or things which must have been well known to have existed. In the present case none of the elements of a custom local orr e m or otherwise are existing• It would also certainly he contrary to all equitable doctrines if after a person had gone to an expense to commence and carry on a business he could after exercising his business according to the Law of a country suddenly and without reason other than apparently a mere caprice or whim of some one claiming to have right, be deprived of the right to carry on his business. It is auite clear that the Municipality have already committed an actionable wrong by entering upon cur client’s premises and working his plant with out his consent, and unless some satisfactory proposal is made by the Municipality to compensate him for this loss, it is cur client’s intention to bring a suit for the purpose of claiming damages in respect of such wrong and to enforce his rights. We may add that cur client feels the position very strongly and is not prepared to submit to what instructs us if is unable to -— he considers the arbitrary and unequitable action which has apparently been adopted,and hew^ich has/cbtaiu satisfaction in the [District or Joint Court, it will be his intention to carry the matter to appeal.

Dated Mehr Ist^lSlO (24th September, 1931). No.22291/61012213. Monsieur le Charge d'Affaires, A certain Yusuf Lut^ffali Khcnj i has submitted tc the Persian Legation in London a petition in connec tion with an Ice Plant which he had erected in Bahrain in partnership with Sheikh Hamed ibni Sheikh Issa Alkha- iifa in which he has set forth the unjust and arbitrary proceedings tarien by Sheikh Hamed against him with the hefcp of the British political Agent in Bahrain in respect of the partnership and has asked for justice tc be ren dered in the case. A copy of the petition is sent here with for the information of that honourable Legation together with a copy of the correspondence exchanged between Khcnji's legal attorney with the Foreign Office in London, the political Agent and the Municipality at Bahrain in which an account is given of the assistance and help given tc Sheikh Hamed as well as the oppressions made by the latter which have been pretested agaiast. As the copy of the enclosed correspondence shows clearly, after Yusuf Lut^fali Khcnji had, at the inducement of the Political Agent, founded the Ice Fac tory in Bahrain in partnership with Sheikh Hamed ioni Sheikh Issa and tried for 6 years, while incurring great expenses in overcoming the difficulties and im proving the business, Sheikh Hamed, with a view tc reserv -ing all the profits of the factory tc himself, has had recourse tc some stupid tricks: he had at first addressed a letter tc YUsuf Khcnji making tc him a proposition tc buy his shares in the business under certain arbitrary conditions/Ml /“N o end it lens while fixing a time-limit cf 10 days# Then, notwithstanding the fact that Yusuf Khcnji had agreed telegraphically to the proposal made hy the Sheikh the latter had handed over to the Municipality his share \ in the 'business with the monopoly right for 5 years with the intention cf making Tusuf‘s share useless. The Muni cipality had, thereupon, forcibly taken possession cf the Plant immediately. The British political Agent has, in reply to the pretest made by Yusuf's attorney against such arbitrary conduct, had recourse to some ridiculous and weak statements, saying, for instance, that if the mono poly right has been granted to the Municipality, Yusuf Lutfali Khcnji can remove his share cf the machine to an other island. Further, he ( the Political Agent) has, in support cf the action taken by the Sheikh in selling his Siiare to the Municipality, while being fully conscious cf the real ‘state cf affairs, written that Yusuf had been invited to buy Sheikh Hamed's share, but he did not take advantage cf the offer*.' I should, therefore, record my Gl-cvernment*s pretest and surprise, along with a series cf the former pretests, at these sort cf illegal and arbitrary acts which are being perpetrated in Bahrain with the assis tance and connivance cf the British officials there. I avail myself cf the opportunity etc. Signed. Fercughi.10(13 4000 7.3U Draft Paper. POLITICAL * Department. DRAFT LETTER . 17 NOV 1932 G. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., Financial Adviser, Bahrein.

Ivly dear Fowle, You will rememder that on your suggestion we asked Belgrave when he was here last summer to get in touch with Khonji’s lawyers with a view to a settlement of the Kdonji case. We understood that he did in fact get in touch with them, dut we never heard from him what happened (he was here for a few days only and was rather rushed). The Foreign Office raised the matter a couple of days ago and suggested that they might write privately to Belgrave and ask him. We did not welcome the idea of direct | correspondence detween them and ! f&amp;CfxArX people-in the and said we I would deal with the matter ourselves I have, therefore, written the personal letter to Belgrave of which I enclose a copy. It was thought here that it was hardly necessary to worry you and the Government of India dy sending the enquiry officially through the Resident, in view of the fact that it arose to some extent out of Belgrave’s talks with us and the Foreign Office when■upvihi hope you will see no objection to this.— S734 : '• {p „■ 1 m Mr. Walton, \x Please see ray note of 25th August he low. Mr. Lascelles was anxious to write to Mr. Belgrave himself to find out what happened about the Khonji case. I do not think we want Foreign Office correspondence with officials in the Gulf which can he avoided and I said, therefore, that I thought it might he simpler if I sent a private enquiry to .them. To this Mr. Lascelles agreed. 2. We do not at the same time want to upset the Resident hy direct correspondence with Gulf officials and while, if you see no objection, I might write to Mr. Belgrave as in the draft, I would suggest that I might also write to Colonel Fowle as in the second draft to make the position clear. W 7 H ‘ V' — ¥- The Khonji case was discussed to-day with Lr. Belgrave and i^r. Lascelies. kr. Belgrave is seeing kx. Khonji*s solicitors this afternoon and after perusal of the correspondence is disposed without prejudice to offer to pay Hs. 1880 , being the balance admittedly uue to them in respect of the year during v/hich the Municipality took over the whole 01 the ice plant ^ in return for withdrawal of all other claims and the abandonment of another claim on their part to a share in the building. The case, I understand from Mr. Belgrave, is much complicated by the fact that while Mr. Khonji s accounts are more than open to suspicion, the oheiKh s are also of the most elementary character. It is to be hoped that an offer of the nature suggested above may dispose of this petty but trouQlesoine incident.

Would you, if it is convenient for you, meet me for lunch at 1.15 at the New University Club and we can then have a talk about the various Bahrein questions. I venture to bother you, however, at once with one of thou and that is the case of Khonji, with which you are no doubt familiar. As you know, Khonji continues to press his claim against the ; 3 heikh in respect of the Bahrein ice factory and the Persians have taken it up in London through the diplomatic channel. I enclose a copy of the latest representation received from them. We have been a little at a loss in dealing with this case at this end, because, though we nave had very full and good reports from the Gulf, we have not/ Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., Hotel Bristol, Brighton.not sufficient detailed Information to enable us to dispose satisfactorily of allegations which may be made by Khonji and his advisers* Fowls has nov telegraphed suggesting that Khonji should take advantage of your presence in iingland to settle the case amicably find I wonder if there is the least prospect of your being able to spare time to see representatives of his solicitors if we could arrange for this through the Foreign Office (they are a Manchester firm, but if you let me know whether you see any objection to having a talk to them and if you would suggest a time, possibly at the end of the week, which I gather would be the easiest for you, we would get the Foreign office to telephone to them and ask them either to send a representative or to arrange for a London correspondent to discuss the case with you.) In any case, I suggest that if you would not mind coming back here after lunch on Thursday, we might have a talk with Lascelles of the Foreign Office, whom I think you met in Bahrein, and who// \&lt; rS »4io has heen dealing with the ease here - It would, I am sure, help very much to clear our ideas about it.

I ao not thin* a settlement Is ever/ lively to be effected by correspondence through the many channels that Mr. KhonJi has adopted.

The actual situation at the moment is that an agreement was arrived recording the division of the ice plant, (of which I enclose a copy) ana the Municij^jity have removed their share to another site. There remains the division of the building, half of which belongs to ShaiKh Hamad and the other hall' to Mr. Khunji, and the payments of half the profits made by the Municipality during the year they worked the plant, amounting to some &amp;.2000/-. 3. Before paying the amount earned in the year 1950 the Advisor has aSKed lor the accounts previous to the division to be supplied to him. Since Mr. Khunji # s agent invariably showed a heavy loss as Shaikh Hamad # d share of a year*s wording, ana the Municlpiaity made a handsome profit in the year they ran it (though charging one instead of three annas a pound for ice) it will be appreciated that some explanation is required.-» Kr.

None of these liabilities are admitt d as they were all incurred by Mr. fusil Khuaji in his sole Interest during ihe period- 2 - when Shaikh HaffiadL took no Xin&amp;neial interest in the concern b* This aiiiount or 1,880/- is not being paid until Kr, Tusir Khunji produces the initial accounts oi the iunds relating to the construction of the building* Since Shaikh Haifcua paid between ^*80,000/- anu gs*40,000/v ior his share or the enterprise »hich has shown a stead/ loss this attitude is periectly comprehensible* as I mentioned in my last letter the plant has been amicably divided and the Adviser has a let er irom Mr. Yusir Khunji f s solicitor admitting this. Ur. Yusir Khunji objects, however, to the Pact that the Balaalya have been given a m-nopOly or the sale oi ice in Bahrain since this prevents his using the single machine that remains to him* Since, however, Kr.--- Yusir Khunj 1, himseir enjoyed a monopoly ior the sale or ic&lt; ice granted by the Bahrain Government Tor 5 years he is clearly estopped Xrom making this claim* Mr. Yusir KhunJ i*s 5 year monopoly expired some 5 years ago.

We have already had two lengthy reports from Captain Prior at Bahrein, and it seems a little hard to ask for a further ’’account of the whole position” if, in fact, all we require is an elucidation of certain specific points. fa.i. ii 7Ml ;XED rm? |E ' SBi si 'v 4 ’ —i * o J FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. (E 3249/5249/91) My dear Gilbert, 18th July, 1932. 5 , wy As Warner told you the other day, the secretary of the Persian Legation called on me on June 28th and spoke in vague terms about the unsatisfied claim of a Persian subject named Yusuf Lutf-Ali Khonji against the Sheikh of Bahrein in respect of an ice factory. At my suggestion he later sent me a memorandum on the suoject of which I enclose a copy. Shortly after, we received direct from Btscoe his despatch of 21st June, of which we sent you a copy on 11th instant, sending U£ copies of reports from Prior regarding this claim, and still more recently I received from Hoare a private letter, of which I also enclose a copy, about Biscoe’s despatch. We feel that the best way of dealing with this rather confused case would be for us to ask the Persian Charge d’Affaires to call, give him the essential facts, inform him that it is advisable for Khonji’s lawyers to send a reliable man out to Bahrein, and incidentally /say J.G. Laithwaite, Esq..say a passing word, or two about the unfortunate tone of the original Persian note to Dodd. But on going carefully into the substance of Prior f s reports, we find that it is by no means clear what the real position is, and there appear to be one or tv/o contradictions of importance. Before, therefore, we send for Ibtihaj, we should feel on safer ground if we had a clear and full account of the whole position from the authorities in the Persian Gulf. Biscoe’s despatch is addressed to us, but as you will see from Hoare*s letter, it had been the intention of the latter that the report should be sent in the normal way to the India Office, since the question is not connected with the consular functions of the Resident. If you agree on this point of procedure, you may perhaps think it worth while to send a short wire to Biscoe, so that our reply to Ibtihaj may not be unduly delayed.COPY (A 3290/3249/91) In 1921 I established a firm for the manufacture of ice in Bahrein in partnership with Sheikh Ahmed Ebn Sheikh Eissa A1 Khalife, the present Governor of Bahrein, and for six years the business was carred on by my legal representative. At the expiration of this oeriod Sheikh Ahmed did not wish to continue the oartnership, and the factory was managed for 3 years, from 1927 to 1929 on my behalf. On 29 May Sheikh Ahmed asked me to hand the factory over to the Municipality, to which I did not agree. He therefore called upon the British authorities to see that his request was complied with. I again was not prepared to agree to this. As the factory is equipped with two sets of ice manufacturing machines, an agreement was reached at the British High Commissioner^ office that Sheikh Ahmed should take over one of the sets, and that I should take over the other, and the partnership was accordingly dissolved in that way. Both uarties concerned, viz. Sheikh Ahmed and my legal representative accepted and signed the agreement at the High Commissioner’s office. On the following day three persons from the Bahrein Municipality, together with an engineer from the Telegraph Office, came on behalf of Sheikh Ahmed to divide the factory, but they did not carry this out on the pretext that the time at their disposal was too short to permit of the necessary equipment of the works, and suggested instead that Sheikh Ahmed should take his share after the summer season. In the year 1929 Sheikh Ahmed did not desire to carry on with the partnership, so I worked the factory at my own profit and loss. In 1930 Sheikh Ahmed still did not wish to take over his share and wanted me to buy it. He made certain proposals for the sale of his share, v/hich I could not accept. I also mademade certain counter proposals for the purchase of his share, which were not accentahle to him. In July 1930 he wrote to me under date of 29 July, that the Municipality was prepared to purchase his share for Rupees 10,CC0, and to give him a monopoly for a period of 5 years, or that I could purchase his share for the same amount hut without the monoooly. He asked me to reply to him within 10 days, otherwise he would sell it. I received this letter on 6th August and on the same day I wired to him that I was orepared to 'buy his share at the price offered 'by the Municipality. The day he wrote that letter was July 29th. The next day, viz, July 30th, he took the keys of the factory from my legal representative and handed them over to the Municipality. The latter took over the works and. proceeded v/ith the manufacture of ice without my knowledge and consent. Sheikh Ahmed had received my wire on the 7th or 8th August, and had informed my representative that my reply was too days late, and that he had sold the factory to the Municipality. My representative and myself have 'been in correspondence with the British High Commissioner in Bahrein and also Sheikh Ahmed. The latter has not replied to any of my letters. The Municipality claimed that they had obtained the monopoly for five years from the Government, and that my share was inoperative. The High Commissioner replied that I could no longer carry on with the work of the factory, as Sheikh Ahmed, the Governor, had sold his share to the Municipality and had granted them the monopoly. Prom August 1930 up to the present no tangible result has accrued.Hamgmm f j / Copy. ^75/14-2 (E 3249/5249/91) 1 O ) i O BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. 1st July, 1932. My dear Rendel, You will have received from the India Office a copy of Biscoe’s report to me on the Khonki ice-plant at Bahrein case. I had meant Biscoe’s report to he addressed to the India Office hut that is an unimportant detail. If action has not already heen taken, I suggest that the India Office proposed to Khonji’s solicitors, Messrs. Hall &amp; Go. (see their letter to Foreign Office of 24th December, 1930) that Khonji seek a settlement on the lines indicated in Biscoe f s despatch and enclosures; that you inform the Persian Minister of this and take the opportunity of expressing regret that the Persian Government should have thought it desirable to hold the language contained in the note of 24th September 1931 (see Dodd 1 s despatch No.572 of October 12th); and I will tell Feroughi that a detailed report has been sent to London as a result of which I hoped that Khonji would be able to reach a settlement. You may think it a bit late in the day to express displeasure about the tone of the Persian note. I am inclined to hink it is, especially as Feroughi provided me v/ith an opportunity of doing so by referring to the Khonji case in a note on an entirely different subject. Yours ever, (Sgd) R.H.

This in all the circumstances is natural.

The correspondence has been carried on between the Adviser, and Mr Khunj^s solicitors, and also his local agent; and the Municipality and Mr Khunj^s solicitors and his local agent, and the solicitors have At various tines also addressed this Agency, the Residency, the India Office and apparently the Foreign Office.

There remains the division of the building, half of which belongs to Shaikh Bamad and the otner half to Mr Khunji, and the pay ments of half the profits mode by the Municipality during the year they worked the plant, amounting to some Ks 2000/- 3 .

The Persian Government have now taken up Yusuf Lutfali Khonji’s case and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has addressed a note to His Majesty f s representative, Tehran, presenting a very one-sided view of the case and enclosing a dossier from which certain papers have been omitted apparently by design. The Persian Government seem not to be actuated by merely disinterested feelings in supporting Mr.Khonji, but the details of the case are still rather obscure and there seems little doubt that Sheikh Earned has acted, if not illegally, at least in a very arbitrary way. We have had most of the papers enclosed in the Persian M.P.A f s. note before. The letters from the Solicitors to the Manama Municipality and to the Sheikh are new, but add little to the story.

A oooy of a despatch which 1 have addressed to the acting Political Heaident at Bushire is also enclosed. I have not asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs for a copy of the missing petition pending a decision upon the points with which I deal below. 2 # The substance of any reply to the Persian Government will doubtless depend on Major Fowlers report. But I do not propose to reply without Your Lordship 1 s instructions, as I am not sure whether Your Lordship would wish any reply at all to be given to this communication from the Persian Government. It does not specifically ask for a reply, but the tone is Insolent and the final paragraph contains serious charges. So far as the past is concerned, this paragraph doubtless refers to the asatter dealt with in Mr. Parr 1 * despatch Ko. *75 of February 21st, and connected correspondence. As for the present note, I have no doubt that the charges could be equally easily refuted. 3. Should it be decided that a reply Is desirable, it is for consideration, further, whether /that The Most Honourable The fcarqeeas of Heading, G.G.B., e to., e to., e tc •, The Foreign office.that reply should ooeb© through this Legation, or be made to the Persian Minister in London. Since the olaiia in question is one between a Persian subject and the ruler of a third State and arises out of events none of which took place on Persian territory, this protest should, I ' surmise, properly have been presented through the Persian Minister in London and it would, therefore, be open to me on formal grounds to reply to the Persian flovernment on these lines, adding that the dossier had been transmitted to Your Lordship. If the Persian Government then really desired to pursue the matter they could do so, according to the usual diplomatic practice, through their representative in London. 4. The chief advantage of this course would be that it would administer a rebuff to the pretensions of the Persian Government who in putting forward this claim are not, I believe, actuated by feelings of sympathy for the claimant but by a desire to keep alive their claim to and grievance regarding Bahrein. This is also, to some extent, an argument for Ignoring the note altogether. The similar correspondence mentioned above was, however, conducted through this Legation. 5. I gather that some correspondence passed on this subject between Your Lordship*s Department and the claimants Solicitors in 1930. It is also possible that Your Lordship may already have received the petition referred to in the note from the Persian Minister in London, and have either replied to the Minister or /decided3 deeided that no reply 1* neeesaary or desirable, I have, nonetheless, thought it ?/©ll to forward the dossier for Your Lordship's information. 6, I am sending a oopy of this desnateh with its enclosures to the Government of India and to the Aoting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

You will oheerve that the dossier eneloaed 2 with this note la ineoisplete, the petition said to have been addressed to the Persian Minister in London having been omitted, presumably through inadvertence, and the text of any reply sent from the Foreign Office to Messrs, tell and Company f s letter of Deoember B4th, 1930, having also been omitted, possibly by design. Be that aa it may, it presents a tendentious view of the ease. 3. You will also observe that the final paragraph contains a charge of connivance against the Political Agent at Bahrein, together with a repetition of various former charges, probably those referred to in the r J egation , 8 note Ho. 63 of February £lst (see Mr. Barr‘a despatch Ho. 16 of that date). I have no doubt that the present charge could be as easily refuted as the former ones . 4.

(24th Senteisfoer, 1931). Ho. 22291/61012213. Monsieur le Charge d*Affaires, A certain Yusuf Lutfali Khonji has submitted to the Persian Legation in London a petition in oonneetlon with an Ice Plant which he had erected in Bahrein in partnership with Sheikh liaised ibni Sheikh lasa Alkhalifa in which he has set forth the unjust and arbitrary proceedings taken by Sheikh Hamed against him with the help of the British Political Agent in Bahrein in respect of the partnership and has asked for Justice to be rendered in the case. A copy of the petition is sent herewith for the information of that honourable Legation together with a copy of the correspondence exchanged between Khonji»s legal attorney with the Foreign Office in London, the Political A *ent and the Municipality at Bahrein in which an account is given of the assistance and help given to Sheikh Hamed as well as the oppressions made by the latter which have been protested against. As the copy of the enclosed correspondence shows clearly, after Yusuf Lutfali Khonji had, at the ind^oient of the Political Agent, founded the Ice Factory In Bahrein in partnership with Sheikh Haraed ibni Sheikh Issa and tried for 6 years, Fhlfce incurring great expenses in overcoming the difficulties and improving the business. Sheikh Earned, with a view to reserving all the profits of the factory to himself, has had recourse to some stupid /tricks:/V warn triokss he had at firat addreaaed a letter to Yueuf Khonjl making to him a proposition to buy his shares in the business under certain arbitrary conditions while fixing a time-limit of 10 days. Then, notwithstanding the fact that Yusuf Khenji had agreed telegraphically to the proposal made by the Sheikh, the latter had handed over to the Municipality his share in the business with the monopoly right for 5 years with the intention of making Yu r uf 1 s share useless. The Municipality had, thereupon, forcibly taken possession of the plant immediately. The British Political Agent has, in reply to the protest made by Yusuf's attorney against such arbitrary conduct, had recourse to some ridiculous and weak statements, saying, for instance, that if the monopoly right has been granted to the Municipality, Yusuf Lutfali Bhonji can remove his share of the machine to another island. Further, he (the Political Agent) has, in support of the action taken by the Sheikh in selling his share to the Municipality, while being fully conscious of the real state of affairs, written that Yusuf had been invited to buy Sheikh Mamed's share, but he did not take advantage of the offer!! I should, therefore, record my Government's protest and surprise, along with a aeries of the former protests, at thisaaort of Illegal and arbitrary acts which are being perpetrated in Bahrein with the assistance and connivance of the British officials there. I avail myself of the opportunity, etc.. (Signed) Feroughiy(j3&gt; ( c^T-/7“^ 7 mBr '- .j ''V' /*•&gt;, ' / ! | -H '•?&lt; ; 95 St.Ar^lrew« Road Worth, _ St, Axmea-on-Sea, i 9 C \ 2Hhd August, 1930.

I give you notice that Shalfth Hemed had no authority from me to dispose of his share in the business and I am not prepared to accept you as my partner in the business. I am advised that in law you have no right to enter the factory premises without my consent and you must certainly understand that the land adjoining the factory and the well which is the source of the water supply to the factory is n$y personal property and ha* never been partnership property. Therefore, unless you immediately surrender the keys of the Factory premises to my Agent, ]*r* Mohaised Rafi Abdulkader and give your immediate undertaking to cease from entering upon my land and/or from using the water supply from my well and/or from using the Ice-making plant and machinery, I will hold you responsible for all damage and loss sustained by me in consequence of your wrongful actions. I may add that immediately it is possible I intend to bring the whole matter before the Political Agent in Bahrein. f1thout prejudice I am prepared to purchase from you the share which you have bought from Shaikh /Hamed^ d2| Ham«d for the same price and upon the same terras as you have purchased the same. Alternatively and also without prejudice I Am prepared to sell to you vy share in the business for 30,000 rupees, hut I am not prepared under any circumstances to sell to you the well in my garden nor allow you to use the water therefrom.

Subsequent to the writing of that letter our client was infornwd that the keys of the Ice making factory at Bahrein had been handed by Sheikh Ha^ed to the Municipality and the latter had entered into possession of the factory and was working for their own use the whole of the plant and machinery therein. Upon receiving such informatlcm our client wrote a letter to the Municipality, a copy of which Is enclosed, and he has received in reply a letter dated the 4th October 1930, a copy of which is also enclosed. From the last mentioned letter you will observe that the Municipality state that they have been granted by the Government of Bahrein a five years cole monopoly for the sale of Ipe in Bahrein, and they state that neither our client nor any other person has the right to sell io© in Bahrein. Both our client and we are absolutely at a loss to understand the position of the matter. We are instructed that Sheikh Hamed, with whom our client was formerly in partnership. Is the head of the Bahrein Government and if this is so we do not understand how Sheikh Hamed can dispose of his share in the /partnershippartnership to the Bahrein mnielpality without our client'i consent and at the same time grant the lunioinallty a monopoly which in fact prohibits our client from earrying on the business which has been established for opwards of 8 years. We shall he pleased If you will look into the matter at onse and let us have a report as to the position and in particular advise what oan be done by our client to protect his interests. Te might add that if our elient 1 * instructions are correct # there appears to be no doubt that in law he could hold the Bahrein Government and the &amp;unioip*iity liable to hia for the damage He has suffered.

Khonjl, a Persian snbjeofe, of 36 College Drive, r? halley Ranine, Fanohester, with reference to sert&amp;in trenaaotions whiah have ta^n place in Bahrein, Persia and with which our olient is connected. * •.., ,j fe are instructed to bring the following facts before you for your consideration and attention. For some tisse prior to 1930 there had been a demand for an loo Factory to be erected at Bahrein, and we are instructed that several suggestions were put forward for the comajencement of auoh a business. Hone of these materialised, however, until our client was approached by the *hen Political Agent and at his request our olient decided to build and equip an Ice-making business on the Island. As an Inducement to embark on this venture, the Political A rent arranged that our client should have a monopoly for 5 years in order that there should be no unfair competition until the business was properly established. Sheikh Bamed who is, we understand, now the ruler of Bahrein, desired to enter into the business and accordingly he and our client became partners each providing the same amount of capital and agreeing that profits and losses of trading be divided equally. jj hereupon, in 1921 a factory for the production of ice was erected on land belonging to our client in Bahrein and two duplicate freezing plants were /Installed - }Instailed - the Initial eoat of our olient^ share being 35,000 rupees. From 1922 until 1928 considerable trouble was experienced in establishing the business owing chiefly to difficulties in the Engineering line but in 1929 our client was able to overcome these difficulties, with the result that the business improved. Our client received a letter dated (2nd Rabrawal) or 29th July 1930 from Shaikh named containing certain propositions and stating that u&amp;ilest our client within 10 days agreed to one of these propositions Shaikh Haisaed would sell his share to the municipality. Immediately upon receipt of this letter on the 6th August 1930, our client cabled Shaikh Hamed agreeing to purchase the share on the same terms and conditions ss offered by the j Funielnality. ** subsequently appeared by letter received froa our client # s Agent, that on the 30th July f 1030, that is, the day after the letter from Shaikh Hamed, that gentleman had taken the key of the business promisee from our clientagent in Bahrein and handed it to the Municipality who thereupon took immediate possession of the Factory. Although our client accepted the terms of the letter of the 29th July which were offered by the Municipality, it is obvious that Sheikh Hamed had no intention whatever of selling hia share of the business to our client. Upon receipt of the information as to the Munioioality taking possession of and working the Plant at the Ice Factory, our client wrote the® the letter dated 22nd August 1930 copy of which is sent herewith. In reply he received the latter dated the 4th October, 1930, a copy /of/V - 3 K j j i % r “^ / • i &gt;&lt; / W 'kJ 6 of ^ioh is sent herewith. ‘ — On the 15th August last our ellent wrote the Political Agent at Bahrein the letter, copy of which is sent herewith, setting out the circumstances and requesting him to take steps to protect his interests. As no reply to this letter had heen received by the 31st October, we ourselves wrote the Political Agent and we enclose a copy of our letter to him and a copy of his reply dated the 22nd Koveaber 1930. 'e enclose copy of the latter which the Political A^ent wrote our client on the 9th November 1930. You will observe that under paragraph 1 of the Political Agent f s letter to us it is stated that 'since your client enjoyed a monopoly at the hands of the Bahrein Government for 5 years he cannot now deny their right to grant such monopolies rf . Ihis, our client informs us, is not correct. T? e monopoly existed solely because there was no other business of this kind on the Island at the time he erected the Factory. It la not understood how the Bahrein Government or any other authority there has power to grant another mono no ly and at the same time prevent our client from continuing to exercise the business which he at the reqiiest of the Authorities and at such a great expense had commenced and whieh he had carried on for years. You will also observe that under paragraph 4 of the letter from the Political Agent it is stated that our silent is at liberty to our cue his claim in the Joint Court ( whieh consists of the Political Agent and Bheikh Hamad) and that such Court is in no way bound by English Law and decided such eases according to local custom. We fail to see how s transaction of this nature can be decided according to 'local custom* or that there can be any austom local or otherwise on a ease like /thistills the only one of its kind. We shall be pleased if you will infomn us what # in the oircuststanoea, laws apoly to the Island and In what Court or way our elient f s olaiia would be decided, as if it be either Britiflh or Indian t*w, our client would desire to be represented b/ an Advocate specialising in the particular law. Further, since any aetion brou^it by our client would necessarily include Sheikh Hawed as a Defendant, it seoxas an impossible situation that the latter or any member of his (Jovemroent abould be in a position to aot in any Judicial capacity. If our client should be dissatisfied with any decision given, can you inform ua whether there is any appeal and If so t© what Court. fe think you will agree that were Kngliah Law to apply - (a) the disoosftl by Sheikh Kaitsed of his share in the partnership without our clients consent,, to the Municipality, and (b) the action of the Municipality in entering upon the partnership reraises and working the plant without our client # s consent would be wrongful acts which could be restrained with consequential damage® ana that if without our client's consent they or any one else entered the premises and resaoved any part of the inachlnery or other property of the partnership (which in paragraph 3 of the Political Agent's letter is stated to be the intention of the Municipality) such would be a wrongful act which could be restrained with the same consequences. We siay say that our client would agree to the matter being settled either • (1) By the whole undertaking being sold by Public Auction /andr 5 /t 7038 H 19 31 ■ ^ • ■ iw \mf y and the prooeedff being divided equally, or (2) By e&amp;oh perty taking one half of the ^aohlnery and each being entitled to earry on a eimiler business on their own aooount. We might point out that in May 1929 Shaikh Hamed brought the question of the partnership before the Politloal Agent and oxer client 1 * Agent was sailed before that gentleman* It was suggested by our silent 1 s Agent that Shaikh Hamed should remove from the Factory one of the two seta of lo© Plant and that thonseforward each party should work in thetr own account. This was agreed to by Shaikh Hamed and thereupon, w© are told, judgment was entered by the Political Agent on these terms. Three days after this dee is ion an Engineer appointed by Shaikh Hamed attended at the Faotory for the purpose of selecting and removing one of the machines, but Shaikh Haraed Informed our client that as the season was so near there was not tiae to remove the plant and erect it in the intended place or to obtain the servioes of an Engineer to work the plant. Shaikh Homed thereupon decided to postpone the removal until some convenient later date, and in the meantime left th* frechine in our cli«nt f s factory* Otir didn't then eontinued to work one machine only for himself, and in fact has never used the other nachlne since. Of course, bf before any agreement were reached as to a settler*mfc, t^e wtmleipelity removed any of the partnership assets, our client would reserve his rights to hold them liable therefor. *?e shall be obliged if you will consider the position as shown above and by the correspondence and let us have your views and advie© thereon. Any recommendation as to what course is the proper one for our client to adopt /will■ ■ will be appreeiated, and if an interview is eonaidered likely to alear up any q-ieation wbleh may require elucidation, we will arrange to attend with our ellent on such cay and at such time at may be convenient to you, We are* Sir, Your obedient servant*, (Signed) Hall k Co.B;/ Mr Mg. 11 Shaikh Hamed Alkhalif&amp; tkxmiH Persian Gulf Sir, Aa no doi«&gt;t you are aware, fcr* Y.L* Khonji haa eonsulted MB with reference to the purported sale by you to the Maaea* Baladiya of your share in the Xo® Plant and the purported grant by you to them of a sole monopoly for the sale of laee In Bahrein for 5 years.

It is our client 9 a intention to bring the metter before the District or Joint Court and to endeavour by all lawful means open to him to protect his rights whieh he is advised he is entitled to, and failing his obtaining satisfaction in that Court he will carry the matter to the appropriate Appeal Court, We trust Jhat you will at once get in touch with the municipality and endeavour to have the matter adjusted according to the respective rights and to see that a proposal is made without delay to compensate our client for the loss he has sustained.

Please see the correspondence attached regarding a complaint by a Mr. Khonji, a Persian A subject, against the Sheikh of Bahrein. There are important lacunae, but the position appears to be that Mr. Khonji in 1921 established an ice factory in Bahrein - he alleges on the suggestion of the Political Agent - and was granted a monopoly for five years; that the present Ruler (then Heir Apparent) entered into partnership with him about 1922 on a fifty-fifty basis as regards capital, profit and loss; that the five-year period of the monopoly expired about 1927, and that the partners agreed that Mr. Khonji should thereafter carry on alone, bearing losses and taking profits. The machinery consists of two duplicate freezing plants. About July 1930 one of the two Bahrein Municipalities appears to have offered to buy out the Sheikh, subject to a monopoly for five years, on terms. The Sheikh, before closing with this offer, gave Mr. Khonji the X. option of buying him out on the same terms. He was met by a counter offer and, in the absence of agreement, finally accepted the offer made to him by the Municipality. The latter entered on the Sheikh's share of the property, worked the joint property, for a period (in respect of which they are prepared to share profits with Mr. Khonji), and now propose to remove their share of the plant elsewhere, leaving Mr, Khonji - who, in view of the monopoly granted to the Municipality, can no longer mate^r sell ice in Bahrein - to do as he thinks fit with his share. An offer by Mr, Khonji to repurchase the SJieikh's sharepc or to sell out his own on terms to the Municipality has been rejected by the latter. Mr. Khonji's solicitors ask for advice as to the action he should take, and the laws applying to the island, the Court or way in which the claim will be decided, and whether, if he should be dissatisfied with any decision given, there is any appeal and, if so, to what Court. The question is one of some little difficulty. The Sheikh of Bahrein has delegated responsibility to His Majesty's Government in cases in which the respective parties are Bahreini subjects and foreigners. Our jurisdiction is exercised under the Bahrein Orders in Council of 1913 and 1922? Paragraphs 45 and 46 of the Bahrein Order in Council would appear to be the governing articles in this case. The Order in Council deals with suits against 'a Bahrein subject', which is defined as 'a subject of the Sheikh of Bahrein', and it seems arguable that the Ruler cannot himself be brought within its operation. Assuming, however, that he can or that he is prepared to agree to the case being decided by the Political Agent, the simplest course would appear to be that it should be heard and determined, with the Sheikh's concurrence, by the Political Agent himself in the District Court (under 45 (1) (a)), and should not, as suggested by the Political Agent in his letter of 9th November on page 15. be referred either to a Joint Court under 45 (1) (b) (consisting of the Political Agent and the Sheikh, or a member of the ruling family) or to the Majlis-el-Urfi of local merchants, to be decided according to local custom, under 45 (1) (c). It would not appear that in any case an appeal will lie from the decision of the Political Agent/ X IrUMA/ (J£ «r/ CXa. cjUxvi O-JXZk. tXZ, Cv*rv^Jrj~ CFiuuL. frlffrACouL, (fA-ftiy* (Za.

The legal position apart, it is incumbent on us to see that the complainant in a case such as the present is assured of reasonable justice. It is difficult to be clear as to the rights and wrongs of the present case on the facts available, but there seems no doubt that the period for which Mr. Khonji’s monopoly was originally granted has expired, and that the State is at liberty to grant a fresh monopoly to some*other individual or body. ^ ^ « f.

INDIA OFFICE approved POLITICAL COMMITTEE\ 19 JAN 193) 4793b 5000 10/30 Gentlemen, In reply to your letter of 24th December, 1930, which has been transferred to this Department from the Foreign Office, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that the Sheikh of Bahrein is an independent Ruler, and that the sole legal jurisdiction exercised within his dominions, with his consent, by H.M. the King, is regulated by the Bahrein Orders in Council of 1913 and 1922, as subsequently amended, to which reference is invited. The Schedule to the Order of 1913 (as amended by King’s Regulation No. 1 of 1924 under Art. 70 of the Order) sets out the Indian Acts applicable in Bahrein in the circumstances described in the Order. Any enquiry as to the local law or custom, if any, which might apply in a case such as the present, should be addressed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. No information on the subject is available in this Office. If your client desires to pursue the case, it is open to him to bring a suit under the provisions of Art. 45 of the Bahrein Order in Council/Council of 1915. The Secretary of State is not prepared to issue any instructions in the matter to the c t [ Political Agent, who may be concerned with the case in a judicial capacity.

Sir, We hare been consulted hy Mr Y.L# Khon^i, a Persian subject, of 35 College Drive, Y/halley Range, Manchester, with reference to certain transactions which have taken place in Bahrain, Persian Gulf, and with which our client is connected. As we understand that Bahrain is under British Protect ion, we are instructed to bring the following facts he fore you for your consideration and attention. 3 For some time prior to 1920 there had been a demand for an lee Factory to be erected at Bahrain, and we are instructed that several suggestions were put forward for the commencement of such a business. None of these materialised, hav ever, until our client was approached by the then Political Agent and at his request our client decided to build and equip an Ice making business on the Island. As an inducement to embark on this venture, the Political Agent arranged that our client should have a monopoly for 5 years in order that there daould be no unfair24/12/30.

Date /-s competition until the 'business was properly established, ^ Shaikh Hamed who is, we understand, now the ruler of Bahrain desired to enter into the business and accordingly he and our client became partners each providing the same amount of capital and agreeing that profits and losses of trading be divided equally. /* Thereupon, in 1921 a Factory for the production of Ice was erected on land belonging to our client in Bahrain and two duplicate freezing plants were installed - the initial coat of our client f s share being 35,000 rupees. 6 From 1922 until 1928 considerable trouble was experienced in establishing the business owing chiefly to difficulties in the Engineering line but in 1929 our client was able toovercome these difficulties, with the result that the business improved. Our client received a letter dated (End Rabrawal) or 29th July 1930 from Shaikh Earned containing certain propositions and stating that unless our client within 10 days agreed to one of these propositions Shaikh Earned would sell his share to the Municipality. Immediately upon receipt of this letter, on the 6th August, 1930, our client cabled Shaikh Earned agreeing to purchase the share on the same terms and conditions as af fered by the Municipality. It subsequently appeared by letter received from our client’s Agent, that on the 30th July 1930, that is, the h /s 1 ■Cont'n Sheet No. 2 24/13/30 The Under Secretary of State to for Foreign Affairs. Date day after the letter from Shaikh Hamed, that gentleman had taken the key of the business premises from our client’s agent in Bahrain and handed it to the Municipality who thereupon took immediate possession of the Factory* Although our client accepted tie terms of the letter of the 29th July which were offered by the Municipality, it is obvious that Shaikh Earned had no intention whatever of selling his share of the business to our client. ^ Upon receipt of the information as to the Municipality taking possession of and working the Plant at the Ice Factory, our client wrote them the letter dated 22nd Aug&amp;st 1930 copy of which is sent herewith* In reply he received the letter dated the 4th Ootober 1930, copy of whichis sent herewith* io On the 15th August last our client wrote the Political Agent at Bahrain the letter, copy of which is sent herewith, setting out the circumstances and requesting him to take steps to protect his interests. As no reply to this letter had been received by the 31st October, we ourselves wrote the Political Agent and we enclose a copy of our letter to him and a copy of his reply dated the 22nd Kovember 1930. ’#e enclose copy of the letter which the Political Agent wrote our client on the 9th Hovember 1930. f] 4 &gt;The tinder Secretary of State Hall &amp; Co.

The monopoly existed solely because there was no other business of £his kind on the Island at the time he erected the Factory. It is not understood how the Banrain Government or any author ity there has power to grant another monopoly and at the same time prevent our client from continuing to exercise the business which he at the request of the Authorities and at such a great expense had commenced and which he had carried on for years • (3 ^ou will also observe that under paragraph 4 of the letter from the Political Agent it is stated our client is at liberty to pursue his claim in the joint Court (which consists of the Political Agent and Shaikh Earned) and that such Court is in no way bound by English Law and decided such cases according to local custom.

We might point out that in May 1929 Sheikh Earned brought the question of the partnership before the Political Agent and our clients Agent was called before that gentleman. It was suggested by our client(s Agent that Sheikh Earned should remove from the Factory one of the two sets of Ice plant and that th—enceforward each party should work on their awn account. This was agreed to by Shaikh Earned said thereupon, we are told. Judgment v/as entered by the Political Agent on these terms. Three days after this decision an Engineer appointed by Sheikh Earned attended at the Factoryfor the purpose of selecting and removing one of the machines, but Sheikh Earned informed our jSheet No. 6 • To 24/12/30 The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affaire.^ client that as the season was so near there was not time to remove the plant and erect it in the intended place or to obtain the services of an Engineer to work the plant. Sheikh Hamed thereupon decided to postpone the removal until some convenient later date, and in the meantime left the machine in our clients factory. Our client then continued to work one machine only for himself,and in fact has never used the other machine since. to Of course, if before any agreement were reached as to a settlement, the Municipality removed any of the partner ship assets, our client v^ould reserve his rights to hold them liable therefor. ^ .*e shall be obliged if you will consider the position as shewn above and by the correspondence and let us have your views and advice thereon. Any recommendation as to what course is the proper one for our client to adopt will be appreciated, and if an interview is considered likely to clear up any question which may require elucidation, we will arrange to attend with oufc client on such day and at such time as may be convenient to you.

Sir, I should be pleased if you would advise me of my position in the following circumstances:- About 8 years ago I entered into a partnership agreement with Shaikh;Earned Alkhalifa whereby we took over a Factory and the machines therein for Ice making on the terms that each of us was to put into the partnership the same amount of capital and profits or losses were to be divided equally. For about 5 years this arrangement was carried out, but at the end of that time it was agreed between Shaikh Hamed and myself that I should continue to carry on tne business and - alonebe responsible for any losses or take over any profits. Last year I was informed by Shaikh Hamed that he desired our partnership to be dissolved, and I understand that the matter came before you and you decided that Shaikh Hamed should be at liberty to take away one of the icemaking machines. This decision was never acted upon and it was arranged that I should continue the business upon the same terms as previously. In the early part of July of this year I received a telegram from Shaikh Hamed informing me that the Municipality at Bahrain had offered to him 10,000 rupees for his share in our partnership with a Royalty of 500 r. for 5 years subject to a monopoly being given to them for that period and Shaikh Hamed offered to allow me to purchase his share upon the same j terms. This I refused, but made an offer containing certain other terms and after several communications I received aletter from the Office of the Adv'ser to the Government at Bahrain making certain suggestions and informing me that if no reply was received in 10 days Shaikh Earned would sell his share to the Municipality and would grant them the 5 years monopoly. I wored in reply to this letter on the 6th August, but on the 11th of August received a cable from my agent informingme that Shaikh Earned had sold to the Municipality. It would, therefore, appear that I am the owner of a half share in the Ice making Factory and the Municipality is the owner of the other half share. I am, hov/ever, advising that according to English lav; I cannot be compelled to accept toe Municipality as my partner, and ifthe matter were in English Courts I should be entitled to apply for the partnership to be dissolved and the assets realised and distributed between the partners. I am not prepared to accept the Municipality as my partner but I would be pre ared either to purchase their share from them or to dispose of my share to them upon satisfactory terms being arranged. I, therefore, wish to know what my remedy is. Jill you please inform me what my position is and whether I can obtain the same relief in Bahrain as I could if the matter were before the English Courts. If so, will you please let me know what procedure should be followed. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant,to 95 St. Andrew Road North, St. Annes-on-Sea, 22nd August, 1930.

I gxve you notice that Shaikh Earned had no authority from me to dispose of his snare in the business and I am not •prepared to accept you as my partner in the business. I am advised that in law you have no right to enter the factory premises without my consent and you must certainly understand that the land adjoining the factory and the well which is the source of the water supply to the factory is my personal property and has bever been partnership property. Therefore, unless you immediately surrender the keys of the factory premises to my Agent, Mr Mohamed Rafi Abdulkader and give your immediate undertaking to cease irom entering upon my land and/or from using the water supplied from my well and/or from using the Ice making plant and machinery, I will hold you responsible for all da-age and loss sustained by me in con sequence of your wrongful actions. I may add that immediately it is possible I intend to bring the whole matter before the Political Agent in Bahrain. ■7 It ho a t prejudice - I am prepared to purchase from you the share whi ch you have bought from Shaikh Earned foi the same price and upon the same terms as you have purchased the same. Alternatively, and also without prejudice I am prepared tosell to you my share in the business for 30,000 rupees, but I am not rreuared under any circumstances to sell to you the well in garden nor allow you to use thewater therefrom/ Bahrein. ^(®) Dated 4th October 1920. No. 884-11 - 1249 To Ha^i Yousuf Lutfially Khon^i Bsq^r., 95 St. Andrews Road Morth, St. Ann-s-on-Sea(England) Dear Sir, I acknowledge your letter of 22nd August 1930 and inform you that the Manama Baladiya has purchased H.E. Sheikh Hamed’s share in the iceplart, it has also obtained from the Bahrein Government a sole monopoly for the sale of ice in Bahrein for five years. ;Vith reference to your offer to sell your half share to the Baladiya for Rs. 30,000/-. »Ve do not accept your offer at this price nor have we any wish to purchase your well and garden. The water of your well which was previously used lor making the ice is dirty and unfit for human consumption and in future the authorities will not allow it to be used lor making into ice. ,le would remind you that as the Manama Beladiya has been granted a five years sole monopoly, neither you nor any other person has the right to sell ice in -Bahrein. You were given the option of purchasing within a specified time which you failed to reply to within the specified time. Yours faithfully, The President, The Manama Municipality, Bahrein.n BY AIR MIL. 56a Mosley Street, MAHCHESTER, 31st October, 1930. His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrein, Persian Gulf. Sir, We have been consulted by Mr Y.L. Khonji of this City with reference to the busines of Ice making carried on by him formerly in partnership with Sheikh Hamed at Bahrein, and we have before us a copy of the letter which our client wrote to you on the 15th August last and to which no reply has yet been received. Subsequent to the writing of that lette-r, our client was informed that the keys of the Ice-making Factory at Bahrein had been handed by Sheikh Hamed to the Municipality and the ly^tei had entered into possession of the Factory and was working for their own use the whole of the pkart and machinery therein. Upon receiving such information our client wrote a letter to the Municipality, a copy of which is enclosed, and he has received in reply a letter dated the 4th October 1930, a copy of which is also enclosed, together with a copy of the letter we have written in r eply thereto. You will observethat the Municipality in their letter state that they have been granted by the Government of Bahrein a five years' sole monopoly for the sale of Ice in Bahrein, and they state that neither our client nor an- other person has the right to sell Ice in Bahrein. Both our client and we are absolutely at a loss to understand the position of the matter. ,7e are instructed that Sheikh Hamed, with whom our client was formerly in partnership, is the head of the Bahrein Government and if this is so, we do not understand how Sheikh Hamed can dispose of his share in the partnership to the Bahrein MunicipalitMunicipality a monopoly which in fact prohibits our client from carrying on the business which has beenestablished for upwards of eight years . We shall be pleased if you will look into the mat ter at once and let us have a reoort as to the position, and in particular, advise what can be done by our client to protect his interests. We might add that if our client’s instruct ions are correct, there app ars to be no doubt that in lav/ he could hold the Bahrein Government and the Municipality liable to him for the damage he has suffered. If you agree, will you kindly act on behalf of our client and take such immediate steps as are necessary to protect his interest. je are, bir, Your obedient servants,No. 1598 of 1930. Political Agency, Bahrain, the 9th November 1930 BY AIR MAIL Y.L. Khonji Esq., 95 St.Andrews Road North, St.Annes-on-Sea, LANCS. ' ‘''f ^ Dear Sir, Please refer to your letter dated the 15th August 1930 which has been submitted to me upon my return to Bahrain. Since you are a Foreign Subject and have a claim against His Excellency Shaikh Hamad, an inhabitant of Bahrain your case will be one for the Joint Court (of which the two members are normally His Excellency and myself) and English Law will not apply. His Excellency would no doubt appoint another member of the al.Khalifa in his place, if he was personally interested in a case, and in the normal way, ti e matter would probably be referred to the Majlis el Urfi of local merchants to be decided according to local custom. Your fear of being obliged to tEke the Municipality as a partner is unfounded since they now intend to remove their engine and work it on a more convenient site. They have no intention of working the machine in partnership. I believe there is a possibility that your Agent may be prosecuted for fraud, since during the concluding years of the partnership he showed the Shaikh’s share annually as a loss of several thousand rupees, whereas the Municipality have made a profit of 3700/- in just over 2 months while selling apparently superior ice at one third the rate charged Yours faithfully, Sd. C.G. Prior. Captain Political Agent, Bahrain. to the public by himNo. 1651 of 1930. Political Agency, Bahrain, the 22nd November, 1930. BY AIR MIL. From - Captain C.G.Prior, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain. To - Messrs Hall, B r ydon .&amp; Chapman, Soli citors, 56a Mosley Street, MANCH ESTER. Sirs, I have the honour to refer to your letter of the 31st October 1930 and to refer you to a letter which I addressed your client on the 9th November of which I enclose a copy. (l) Since the matter may com© before me in a judicial capacity I am unable to offer any comment on your client’s position, but since your client himself admits hav ing enjoyed a monopoly at the hands of the Bahrain Government for 5 years, a monopoly which has since lapsed, he cannot now m———— deny their right to grant such monopolies. In fact, since they have full financial control, there is nothing whatever to prevent them doing what they please. (2) It is true that your client will be unable to produce ice in Bahrain in the future, but there is nothing to prevent him moving his share of theplant to the Mainland or any other country he chooses. (3) The Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Government onforms me that the Municipality will pay your client’s half share of this Summer’s earnings upon demand. The Municipality, he informs me, have no intention whatever of working in partnership with your client, i n fact they 1.are removing their share of the plant (the machinery consists of two duplicates freezing plants) to another site. Your client was given the opportunity, he tells me, of purchasing Shaikh Hamad’s share hut did not take advantage of it. (4) If your client feels that he has a legal claim, he will he at liberty to pursue it in the Joint Court, hut, as I informed him, this Court is in no way £'ound hy English law and decides such cases according to local custom. I have the honour to he Sirs, Your most obedient servant, C.G. Prior, Political Agent, Bahrain.CONFIDENTIAL. T r B. 422. India Ollice P. 1632/30. Exercise of Jurisdiction in Cases affecting Foreign Subjects in Bahrein by the British Political Authorities. Jurisdiction over British Subjects. 1. Article 4 of the Convention of 1861 between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the British Government provides that “ all offences which they {British subjects) may commit, or which may be committed against them, shall be reserved for the decisions of the British Resident, provided the British Agent located at Bahrein shall fail to adjust them satisfactorily.” Jurisdiction in Cases affecting- Foreigners. 2. By the Agreement of 22nd December 1880 and the Exclusive Agreement of 13th March 1892, the Sheikh bound himself not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Governments other than His Majesty’s Government; not to allow the Agents of such Governments to reside within his territory without the assent of His Majesty’s Government; and not to alienate, mortgage, or give for occupation any part of his territories save to His Majesty’s Government. Responsibility for the protection of foreigners in Bahrein may be regarded as having passed to His Majesty’s Government as a corollary to these two Agreements. But the question of jurisdiction does not appear to have arisen in an active form until 1900. In December of that year the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that a German subject, Mr. Wonckhaus, intended to open a branch of his business in Bahrein. The Political Resident suggested that, in the event of any mercantile or other cases arising between Bahreini subjects and Mr. Wonckhaus or his agent, the Assistant Political Agent should be instructed to deal with such cases as if they were cases between British subjects and subjects of the Sheikh. 3. The Government of India informed the Political Resident in reply that “ Mr. Wonckhaus being a foreigner and not a protected person, the Assistant Political Agent cannot claim any jurisdiction in such cases. Mr. Wonckhaus and his agent, if a foreigner and not a native Indian subject of His Majesty, must be regarded as liable in such cases to the jurisdiction of the Sheikh. “ As, however, the Sheikh is bound, under treaty, not to admit the consular agencies of other nations without the consent of the British Government, it is expedient that the British representative should, as a matter of courtesy, extend his good offices to European foreigners in any disputes between them and the Chief of Bahrein,or his subjects, and, in the event of necessity, he should claim to protect all such foreigners as he would a British subject. I am to request that Mr. Gaskin may be instructed to this effect.” The action taken by the Government of India was subsequently approved by His M ajesty’s Government. 4. In June 1903, the question having arisen of the purchase by Mr. Wonckhaus of certain premises in Bahrein which he had hitherto held on a temporary lease, the Government of India instructed the Political Resident as follows :—“ In view ... of the belief which Mr. Wonckhaus is reported to hold that, in the event of his acquiring property, he will not be amenable to local law, but will be subject to the extra-territorial jurisdiction of Courts of his own country (though there are none such with local jurisdiction in Bahrein), the Government of India approve your proposal to warn the Sheikh of Bahrein that no such acquisition can give to any Consul or other representative of a foreign nation the right to enter into direct relations with the Chief, and that, should any such official address the Chief, he should be referred to the British authorities. The position should also be clearly explained to Mr. Wonckhaus.” 4371 75 3.30 Lr. d. 4 May 1901, No. 708 E.A., end. in G. of I. Desp. 72, of 9 May 1901 P. 614/01.

In 1.901-5 two incidents affecting foreign subjects took place in the Islands. In the first of these, a German subject—an employee of Messrs. Wonckhaus—became involved in a brawl, in the course of which he suffered personal injuries. Failing, as he thought, to secure adequate redress through the Political Agent, to whom his first complaint was addressed, Mr. Wonckhaus made representations to the German Consul at Basra, who addressed the Sheikh direct on the subject. His Fxcellency, in reply, acknowledged the letter and added, “I have now to inform you that this matter is before the British Government, and I cannot say anything on the subject.” The Foreign Office at a later stage instructed the Charge d’Affaires at Berlin that, should representations be made to him in the matter by the German Government, he should state that it had been brought to the notice of Ilis Majesty’s Government, and that a British ship would be sent to Bahrein in order that an inquiry might be instituted. The German Government do not appear to have taken any action. The German Consul at Basra subsequently thanked the Political Resident “for your efficient help to the German firm, which, I trust, settles the case.” C. In the second case (November 1901), an accidental quarrel having arisen between a retainer of the Sheikh’s nephew and a Persian, attacks were made upon Persian subjects in Bahrein. Apprehensive that the Sheikh would endeavour to deal with the case in the local Courts, they telegraphed for support to the Shah, and conversations took place between His Majesty’s Minister and the Mushir-ud-Dowleh, as the result of which the latter telegraphed to the Persian community urging them to keep calm, as “I have had a long talk with the British Minister . . . and I am sure he will take early steps to get the affairs settled and the culprit punished.” The Sheikh, however, adopted an uncompromising attitude on the question of jurisdiction, maintaining that he would not admit any interference “ in cases between Arabs and Persians, who were all Mohammedans,” and that they must go before the local Shara Courts, which, composed as they were of Sunnis, were unlikely to do justice to the Shiah Persians. Argument proving unavailing, an ultimatum was presented to Ilis Excellency. He accepted the demands of His Majesty’s Government, and though no specific reference to the point was made in the ultimatum, the jurisdiction of the Political Agent appears thenceforth to have been definitely established, as a a matter of practice, in respect of British and foreign subjects in Bahrein. 7. Correspondence took place between 1908 and 1911 in regard to the preparation of an Order in Council to confer jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners in the Islands on the Political Agent at Bahrein. It was decided that it was desirable to obtain a formal request from the Sheikh that he should be relieved of jurisdiction over foreigners. After discussion with the Political Agent, His Excellency addressed the latter on Kith July 1909, in the following terms:—“ After compliments. It is not hidden from you that I have had considerable trouble in many cases (that arose) in my territory in which foreigners were involved. For this reason I wish that I may not be held responsible in these cases, and I would be grateful to British Government if they remove this trouble and responsibility from me. I mean that it (the British Government) should exercise authority in all cases in which the foreigners only are concerned but not in other cases ; and in cases that occur between foreigners and my subjects, it is necessary that you and 1 should settle them jointly.” 8. The Political Resident remarked, with reference to the reservation contained in the concluding sentence of the Sheikh’s letter, “As its effect is simply that such cases will be disposed of by the joint Court, and oives foreigners the same treatment that British subjects now receive, there seems no need for exception to be taken to it.” 9. The Sheikh subsequently represented that his letter of Kith July 1909, giving jurisdiction over foreigners to the British Government, was intended only “to cover subjects of recognised Powers and not the dependents of petty Arab potentates in Gulf, with some of whom he claimsto have special arrangements providing for reciprocal acceptance ol each other’s direct jurisdiction. I informed him that if he could produce Viceroy’s tel. to agreements, and if the other parties, on being referred to, acknowledged ^^Juiy 0 !/^^- their validity, T thought we should be prepared to recognise them . . peatingtei. from In the light of the protest in question, the wording of the Draft Order in p 0l 2^2/i2 ^Council was amended to its present form, under which (Article S of the Order in Council of 1913) the power conferred by the Order extends “to the persons and matters following in so far as by Treaty, grant, usage, sufferance, or other lawful means, IIis Majesty has jurisdiction in relation to such persons, matters, and things, that is to say :— (1) 1 British subjects as herein defined within the limits of this Order. (2) Foreigners with respect to whom the Sheikh of Bahrein has agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty. (3) Bahrein subjects registered in the Political Agency as being in the regular service of British subjects or foreigners; with the proviso that all cases wherein such Bahrein subjects are concerned shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Part V of this Order. (4) The expression ‘person to whom this Order applies’ shall be construed in accordance with the above three sub-Articles. (5) '1'he property and all personal or proprietary rights and liabilities within the said limits of British subjects and of foreigners within sub-Article (2) and of Bahrein subjects within sub-Article (3), whether such persons are themselves within or without the limits of this Order. (G) British ships and ships belonging to foreigners within sub- Article (2) with their boats, and the persons and property on board thereof, or belonging thereto, being within the limits of this Order: provided that jurisdiction over foreign ships shall not be exercised otherwise than according to the practice of the High Court in * England in the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign ships. (7) If any question arises whether the subjects or citizens of any country, State, or tribe have or have not been placed under the jurisdiction of His Majesty by agreement with, or the consent of, the Sheikh of Bahrein, it shall be inferred by the Court to the Political Resident, and a certificate under his hand and seal shall be conclusive on the question and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.” 10. Part V of the Order, to which reference is made in Article 8 quoted above, deals with the important class of case, whether civil or criminal, in which the parties are respectively a Bahrein subject and a person to whom the Order applies. The procedure laid down in it is as follows : — “ (a) Criminal. Article 41.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to institute a complaint against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to institute a complaint against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall entertain the same, and may— (a) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, himself hear and determine it in his District Court, or (/&gt;) send it to the Joint Court, or (c) if the defendant is a Mahommedan, refer it to a Kazi for decision, sending a representative of the Agency to record briefly the proceedings. Such decision, when endorsed by the Political Agent, shall for all purposes be considered as if it were that of the District Court. (2) Kothing in this Article shall prevent the Political Resident from exercising the revisory powers possessed by him under Article 4 of the Convention with Bahrein, dated the 31st May 186l. ,iC * See para. 1 above.4 v f 7 y P. 5040/20. i P. 5668/27. Pol. Res. Desp. to G. of I., No. 295 S of 1 Sept. 1927, para. 28. i~ (b) Civil. Article 45.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to bring a suit against a person 1,0 whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to bring a suit against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall admit the complaint, and (a) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, may hear and determine the suit in his District Court, or (b) may hear and determine it in a Joint Court, or (c) may refer it to the Majlis-el-Urf for decision, or (d) in cases between pearling-masters and divers, may refer it to the Salifah Court, or (e) with the consent of the several parties, may refer the case to one or more Arbitrators for settlement. (2) The judgment of the Joint Court or of the Majlis-el-Urf shall for all purposes be considered the same as if it were that of the District Court. (3) An appeal from the decision of the Salifah Court shall lie to the Political Agent acting in concert with the Sheikh of Bahrein, and in all Salifah cases their joint decision shall be final. (4) The award of the Arbitrator under Sub-Article 1 (e) shall be final, and shall not be open to appeal unless the same shall within a reasonable time have been ordered by the Political Agent to be set aside on the ground that it is not final or is defective, or that the Arbitrator has exceeded his authority, or has been guilty of misconduct in the matter. (5) Nothing herein mentioned shall prevent the District Court, the Joint Court, the Majlis-el-Urf, the Salifah Court, or the Arbitrator from referring any matter in the progress of a suit which involves a point of Mahommedan law to a Kazi for decision, or from sending any party or witness, being a Mahommedan, to a Kazi for the administration of an oath.” • 11 . At no subsequent stage does the Sheikh appear to have shown any signs of going back on his delegation of responsibility in respect of foreigners other than the subjects of States in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty’s Government, Difficulties, however, arose in the post-war period in connection with his claim to exercise jurisdiction over Nejdis and inhabitants of El Katr. In 1920 protests were received from Ibn Sand as to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Sheikh over Nejdi subjects. A similar protest appears to have be'en made at about the same time by the Sheikh of Qatr, both parties requesting the Political Agent to exercise jurisdiction on their behalf. The Political Agent in consequence issued on 20th November 1920 a notice that all foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of Arab Rulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrein, were, while in Bahrein, entitled to British protection. The decision was not well received by the Sheikh ; but it has not been contested by him, and since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested with the British Political authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council of 1913 and 1922, as subsequently amended.
