Pelly also reports on his intentions to take
                           Bereniceto the Rassool Khaimeh [Ra's al Khaimah] coast to issue letters of warning to the Chiefs there who may aid the Wahabees and then to position her at Sohar and suggesting that if a war vessel were available it could be positioned off the coast near Rass-ool Khaimah.The letter goes on to speculate on the effects of a victory for the Sultan on the Wahabees and the possibility of a subsequent blockade of the Wahabee ports of Khatiff [Qatif] and Ajair [Uqair] by the Sultan which could drive them completely away from the coast of the Persian Gulf.The letter refers to a sketch map showing the locations of places referenced in the letter, however this map is no longer enclosed.Also discussed in the letter is the arrival of [Hubert Izaak] Walton in
                           Amberwitchwith 160 miles of telegraph cable that had been ordered when the Mussendom [Musandam] telegraph station was to be moved to Henjaum [Hengam] and which it is now hoped part of the cable can be used for a branch telegraph line to Muskat from Charbur [Chabahar]. Pelly also ventures to suggest that in regards to the difficulties at Henjaum that it could be swapped for Bassidore instead.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024195009.0x000003#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
