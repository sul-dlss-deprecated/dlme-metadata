The practice in Bahrain is tnat the mortgagee an acll ^royeitt moi’t gaged to him without the intoivantion of the Jourt, if the mortgagor agrees to the aale; hut if the mortgagor does not agree to the calc, the mortgagee iilea a suit i or the foreclosure of the mortgage.

This office last letter on the subject is at page 21. I cannot find any definite rulings or regulations on the point in question, since the court depends in many the following points. It is observed in many suits that come to the court in connection with mortgages, that although the mortgagee is duly authorised in the document/to sell the property in default 6f the latters redemption dm the stipulated period, the former seeks intervention of the court *for the foreclosure. It may be due to two reasons. Secondly, if a property is put to sale by a person other than the possessor, the public may not come forward to buy it. . cases on customs and practices for^settlement, I submit by the mortgagor Firstly, when the property remains under the possession of the mortgagor and the mortgagee is unable assert lij^i own possession.

To, The Manager, The Eastern Bank, Limited, B A H R A I N. / i 'V' Bear Sir, Please refer to your letter No.24/33 dated the 12th 'February 1933, regarding mortgages of property. 2. I find it impossible to answer the question put by your Head Office with precision. Cases of this nature have occurred in which a m^rt^agee has sought the intervention of the Court; but it is posuiole that others have occurred, in which the mortgagee nas sold property, even if the mortgagor has not assented to the sale • 3. I think that it would be well if you would | explain to your Head Office that in &amp; place like Bahrain, where law is largely a matter of local custom, it is difficult, if not impossible, to give hard anu fast legal interpretations, such as have been sought in your letters. You will appreciate that a couse which is A adopted in one case, may be unsuited to We circumstances of another; and a mortgagee would, no doubt, be guided partly by expediency. If he were a more influential man than the m rtgagor, h« mijit effect the sale in spite of his objection: if, however, he thought that tne mortga gor might stab him in the course of the proceedings, he probably would not do sot 4. I would, however, add that whiie there isdiificulty in answering questions on precioe legal ’Ap points, it is usually possible for the Political Agent to ensure to a Just claim a substantial measure of justice• Yours faithfully. 4 k Lieut.
