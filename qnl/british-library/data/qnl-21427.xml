NOTE.—This collection of papers starts with (1) an India Office Political Department Memorandum, dated 23rd April 1918, which summarises the history of the inception of the Malleson Mission, and (2) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, dated 11th November 1919, which (besides making certain proposals at its close) summarises the controversy up to that date regarding incidence of expenditure. The correspondence regarding expenditure which follows the Chancellor s memorandum is given up to date. There are two appendices. Appendix I. gives correspondence regarding expenditure which precedes the Chancellor’s memorandum and is summarised in it. Appendix II. gives the main military or political telegrams which are referred, to in memoranda (1) and (2) or in the later correspondence regarding expenditure. (N.B.—This collection of papers is printed from India Office files only.) India Office, January 1921. 1.—Note by Political Department, India Office, for Eastern Committee. The Turkestan Mission. 1. The project of sending a British Mission to Turkestan appears to have originated in an informal suggestion made to the War Office by Sir Arthur Hirtzel in December 1917. The first official document on the subject is a telegram from the Secretary of State to the Government of India, Army Department, dated the 4th January 1918, to the following effect:— “ Do you think it practicable to set up British organisation in Turkestan like Dunsterville’s ;in Caucasus, to support anti-Maximalist movement, and have you suitable officers ? War Office would be glad if anything of the kind could be done, but have not sufficient information to form opinion.” 4 2. The Government of India (Army Department) replied on the Sth January 1918. They drew attention to the absence of any Government in Turkestan “to which a Mission would be helpful as well as useful to us ” ; and to the impossibility, owing to difficulty of communications, of affording effective military support to such a Mission in case of need. On the information at their disposal, they did not regard the proposal as a practical one, but considered' that “ it would be advisable to make “ all preparations in regard to personnel, &amp;c., so that, in case a demand, should arise, “ we should be able to proceed without delay.” They added that, before any such Mission actually started, it would be for consideration whether the Amir of Afghanistan should not be taken into our confidence. 3. After consultation with the War Office and Foreign Office, the Secretary of State telegraphed as follows to the Government of India on the 25th January 1918 :— “ War Office consider that, in view of proposed intimate connection between Turkestan and Caucasus, 1 preparation and despatch of suitable Mission to former should be undertaken without delay. Absence of regular Government regarded as argument for, rather than against, Mission, and effective military support not considered essential provided officers chosen are men of initiative and enterprise and are plentifully supplied with funds. Officers should be accompanied, if possible, by persons qualified to conduct Muhammadan propaganda in favour of Allies, and every endeavour should be made to exploit anti-Bolshevist and pro- autonomous sentiments.” 1 The British Consul-General at Meshed telegraphed to the Foreign Office on the 6th January that a meeting of Muhammadans and non-Maximalists, held at Khokand in the preceding month, had decided to declare the autonomy of Turkestan and to take steps to create a provisional administration. It was j)roposed to enter into intimate relations with the Cossacks and the Caucasus, with a view to concerted action. 3136 25 1.21 AThe Government of India were asked to submit definite proposals without delay, and in the meantime to put in hand the preliminary arrangements at once. 4. They replied (Army Department telegram of 2nd February 1018) as follows :— k ‘ To deal with the problem proposed by the War Office, it is considered by us that the best results would be obtained by establishing two centres from which, as opportunity offered, missions or emissaries could lie sent into Russian Turkestan: the one at Meshed, dealing with all the country west of the Oxus and the plain country of Bokhara; and the other based on Kashgar, dealing with Ferghana and Samarkand, in which provinces autonomy appears to be commenced.” They proposed to place General Malleson in charge of the Meshed Mission and Colonel Dew in charge of that based on Kashgar. 5. Before orders had been passed on the above recommendations, a telegram was received from the Government of India in the Foreign Department representing that the object of the proposed Mission appeared “ hopelessly vague,” that its chances of success were “ extremely problematical,” and that the “ entry of British emissaries “ into Russian Turkestan would certainly excite liveliest suspicions of the Amir and “ in Afghanistan generally, whatever excuse we might give.” They therefore urged that the project should be held in abeyance pending the receipt from the Amir of a reply to a personal letter addressed to him by the Viceroy on the 10th January inviting his views on the whole situation in Central Asia as affected by the collapse of Russia. 6. It was decided to suspend action in regard to the Mission accordingly, and the Government of India were so informed on the 7th March 1918. Meanwhile, with a view to meeting the Government of India’s complaint of the “ vagueness ” of the project, the India Ollice (letter to War Office and Foreign Office, 16th February 1918) made the following tentative suggestions as to the instructions to be furnished to the British officers in the event of the Mission ultimately taking shape :— “It is presumed that the main energies of the Mission should be devoted to propaganda among the local Muhammadan population, tending to counteract the anti-British influences believed to be at work in the country, and to check enemy intrigues and attempts at penetration. With this object in view, it would be their endeavour, as opportunity served, to strengthen and encourage any elements in the population making for stability in local affairs or likely to provide an effective barrier against Turco-German schemes of political or commercial expansion based upon ‘ Pan-Turanian ’ or other ideals. Local recruitment for military service should presumably form no part of the Mission’s programme, though the officers would not be debarred from engaging men as personal guards or for such other special purpose as might be found desirable.” The letter added that these suggestions were necessarily somewhat vague, but that it did not seem possible, on the information available, to do more than indicate the general lines on which the Mission should work. “ The officers selected should “ have full discretion to avail themselves of all opportunities that local conditions may “ provide for countering enemy propaganda and promoting and stimulating pro- “ British sympathies among the inhabitants.” Both the Foreign Office and War Office expressed their general concurrence in the India Office suggestions. 7. On the 21st March 1918, the Government of India (Foreign Department) telegraphed as follows :— “ We have had no reply from the Amir as yet, but as selected officers are now here awaiting orders, and weeks must elapse before they could reach Meshed and Kashgar, we do not propose to defer their despatch further. Though we are still without evidence of any pro-Ally elements in Russian Turkestan with whom they could co-operate, it seems desirable that they should move at once to centres where they can acquaint themselves with local notables and conditions, and take advantage of any favourable opportunity.” This proposal was approved by His Majesty’s Government on the 30th March 1918.Q . &gt; 8. On tlie 9th March 1918, the Government of India (Foreign Department) reported— . (L) that a Political Mission consisting of Major F. M. Bailey, Captain Blacker and Captain Etherton, with some 10 assistants, was about to start for Kashgar “ to enquire into local conditions and report on possibility of getting into “ touch with elements in Russian Turkestan, with whom they could work “ in allied interests and combat German and Turkish propaganda.” (N.B.—We have since learned that this Mission has actually started for Kashgar; on arrival there, it will place itself itself under the orders of the British Consul-General.) ('2) that four officers, viz., Captain Bingham, Captain Bray, Captain Samad Shah and Subadar-Major Mala Khan, were being sent to Meshed to work under the Military Attache (Colonel Redl) as military intelligence officers, “ with “ a view to investigate possibilities of despatch of military Mission into “ Russian Turkestan.” 9. As regards the Meshed Mission, the Commander-in-Chief in India reported to the War Office on the 12th April, that the following instructions had been sent to the Military Attache at Meshed :— “ Under your orders these officers will collect all possible information regarding the situation in Turkestan and get into touch with notables and other elements who could assist in such a Mission. Active propaganda not to be undertaken without orders from here, and Turkestan is not to be entered. . . . You should work in consultation with Consul-General. The Commander-in-Chief explained that the Mission would be a military one. but that, until it became evident that its prospects were such as to justify the employment of a General officer, it was not intended to warn General Malleson {see para. 4). 10. Mission to Kashgar. The primary objects of this Mission are as stated in para. 8. But it is also hoped that the presence of British officers at Kashgar will tend to strengthen the hands of the civil and military authorities of Chinese Turkestan, and to encourage them to deal effectively with local disturbances or with hostile activities from outside the province. In this connection it may be recorded that the British Consul-General at Kashgar (Sir G. Macartney), in a despatch dated the 20th December 1917, drew attention to the danger of outbreaks of lawlessness in the province, with which the local administration would be powerless to cope, and advocated the creation of a force of local military police, nominally under the Chinese, but actually controlled by British officers. As a preliminary step, he recommended that a body of 30 Indian infantry, with three or four British and some Indian officers, should be sent to Kashgar, ostensibly for the protection of the British Consulate, but “ i n reality to form the nucleus out of which the military police would be evolved.” Both the British Minister at Peking and the War Office have supported Sir G. Macartney’s proposal. The Government of India, who were consulted on the subject quite recently, have replied (20th April) that they are in communication with Sir G. Macartney and will report further in due course. They state that Major Baileys Mission has an escort of six Indian regulars as orderlies ; difficulties of transport made it desirable to keep down numbers. 11. No reply has yet been received from the Amir to the A iceroy’s letter of the 10th January {see para. 5). J. E. S. Political Department, India Office, 23rd April 1918. 2.—Memorandum by Chancellor of the Exchequer, dated 11th November 1919. Incidence of the Cost of General Malleson s Military Mission now at Meshed. (i) On 14th August 1918 the India Office informed the Treasury that the Viceroy had, at General Malleson’s request, authorised him to draw on His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran for such funds as might be required for Secret Service expenditure, to be debited to the War Office. The Secretary of State presumed that the Treasury would agree that such expenditure, with all other charges incurred by General Malleson’s Mission at A 24 Meshed or by the troops under his command, should be debited to Imperial revenues as part of the extraordinary expenses of the war, and asked for the wishes of the Treasury on the point whether the charge should fall on Army Votes or the Foreign Office Vote (31769/18).* The Foreign Office view (semi-official) was that this was entirely a military question to be settled by the India Office, the War Office and the Treasury. The War Office view (also semi-official) was as follows:— The Mission was under the control of the Indian Government, subject to the general direction of the Eastern Committee. Its main objects were to check enemy intrigue and penetration from Turkestan ami anti-llritish propaganda among the local Mussulman populations, and to &gt; These words are incorrect according encourage the stable element of the populations to the India Office view. (See (v) below.) ^ -luikcstan [and 1 ersia j against Pan- 1 uranian schemes supported by Germany. I he VV ai Office had no knowledge of the amount of the expenditure, but regarded its nature as similar to that of the subsidies to the Persian Government and the maintenance of the South Persia Rifles (both shared equally by the Imperial Government (Foreign Office Vote) and the Indian Government). Their view was that the onus of proof of dissimilarity lay on the India Office, but that m any case the Imperial share should be charged against the Foreign Office and not against Army Votes. The ^essence of the \\ ar Office case may be summed up in Mr. Widdows’ woids. the Mission is described as a Military Mission, but though the agency is military the expenditure is political, and, as in the case of the Caucasus Military “ Agent, the foreign Office should be responsible for it on behalf of the Imperial “ Government.” I his view was qualified by the admission that the War Office would doubtless have to bear the cost of the small Indian force supporting the Mission, which had been in action to support the Transcaspian (anti-Bolshevik) Government, and that in respect of this action (outside the neutral territory, be it noted, of Persia) the position was similar 1o that of troops of the Persian cordon generally, i.e., the cost should be regarded as part of extraordinary military operations outside India. ( 11 ) On 14th November 1918 the Treasury replied to the India Office in the sense of the War Office view quoted above, supporting the argument by the following citation from a memorandum by Sir H. Cox “ We should not only continue and “ increase our present efforts to block the routes through Persia effectively, but we must make a determined attempt to organise resistance to an invading force from “ the w r est along the railway from the Caspian to the Afghan border between now “ and next winter. This can only be done by utilising any nucleus there may be in that part of the world which is inclined to stand for us and for law and order, and by supplying any such nucleus with money, arms, and, possibly, instructors.” The Treasury added : — “ In so far as the Mission aims at influencing or organising the population of a part of Persia,! expenditure thereon would seem properly to be divisible between “ Indian and Imperial funds in the same way as the expenditure on the South Persia “ Rifles, and on subsidising the Persian Government tribal chieftains, &amp;c., which “ likewise was occasioned by the existence of a state of war outside Persia,” and expressed the hope that on reconsideration of the nature of the Mission the Secretary of State foi India would accept tins conclusion, which was in accordance with the general principle that, in view of the interests of India in Persian affairs, expenditure m that country (othei than expenditure upon troops from the Indian establishments employed there during the war) is divisible equally between India and Great Britain (31769/18). (iii) I 11 January 1919 small detachments of British troops under General Malleson had leached Askabad, Ixrasnovodsk and Merv, m addition to those stationed at Meshed. General Malleson, i.e., had advanced from his base into Transcaspia, and had tried (though without success) to set up and maintain a mixed Russian and Tartar Government at Askabad; but the Foreign Office and India Office had become convinced of the hopelessness of the undertaking and had desired to withdraw the * The numbers in this Memorandum presumably refer to Treasury files, t This was not so, according to India Office view. See (v) below.0 Mission to Meshed, but had refrained from sending instructions to withdraw in deference to opposition from the War Office. On 7th January ]919 an inter-Departmental Conference was held at the Foreign Office to consider the position of the Mission. At this Conference the Director of Military Intelligence described the object of maintaining General Malleson’s force as follows :—■ (1) To prevent the Bolsheviks from penetrating into Persia. (2) To protect Krasnovodsk from the east (including hold on the Transcaspian Railway). (3) To contain a large Bolshevik force which would otherwise be free to attack the Orenburg Cossacks, to which should be added (4) The collection and evacuation of released Austro-German prisoners of war. The C Conference decided to consult the Government of India. Pending a meeting between Generals Milne and Malleson, the Viceroy authorised General Malieson to give further financial assistance to the Transcapian Government. This action was said to have been approved by an inter-departmental conference and by the Treasury representative thereon 14.086/19). # (iv) On 22nd January 1919 the Treasury wrote to the India Office referring to the decision of His Majesty’s Government to limit to 100,000L the expenditure to be incurred in connection with the expedition, stated that the Treasury would not be responsible for any excess, and asked that General Malleson should cable an exact statement of The expenditure up to the date when General Milne assumed command (1822/19). (v) The answer from the India Office to the letter quoted above (ii) (31769/18) was received on 20th February 1919. The Secretary of State for India was unable to accept the Treasury view, and wrote :— “It was no part of this Mission’s aim to influence or organise the population of Persia. It was designed to establish an intelligence centre for watching events in Russian Central Asia with the ultimate object of intervention in that region if circum stances required or permitted. It definitely assumed after a time the form of a Military Mission, but throughout its object was to counteract German-Bolshevik developments in Central Asia.” Accordingly the Secretary of State asked the Treasury to accept as a charge upon Imperial revenues all expenditure on the Mission other than ordinary charges of officers or men of the Indian Army employed on it, which would be chargeable to India under the terms of the Parliamentary Resolutions. (vi) The answer of the War Office was a request (addressed to the India Office, 15th January 1919) that the only charges to be brought against Army Funds in connection with the Mission should be those in connection with the troops actually engaged in military operations. (vii) The Treasury, in reply to the India Office (8th March 1919), merely asked for an account of expenditure incurred before considering the question further. (8013/19). (viii) The Foreign Office view of the question of the incidence of charge was sent to the Treasury on 4th March, and was entirely opposed to the India Office view. In Lord Curzon’s opinion the Mission was Indian, both in its inception and in its composition. It was, moreover, intended in the main to serve Indian ends, viz., to prevent enemy agents from penetrating into Central Asia and causing trouble in Afghanistan. Lord Curzon accordingly considered that the cost of the expenditure should not fall upon Foreign Office Votes. (9911/19). (ix) On 8th February 1919 the Middle Eastern Committee resumed discussion of the proposal to withdraw General Malleson’s Mission from Transcaspia, having now before them General Milne’s report of his visit to General Malleson, Askabad and Merv. The gist of the report was :—“ Either he must help (the Transcaspian) Government, both financially and with troops, arms and ammunition, or clear out altogether.”r p]}g Conference decided unsinimously tliftt n tele^icim slionld be sent to tlie Covernment of India proposing that General Malleson’s Mission slionld be withdrawn to Meshed, with a possible outpost at Kuchan ; that the withdrawal should be slow enough to enable friendly elements of the population to leave, anil that on healing from the Government of India the War Office should reply to General Milne. (11413/19.) ( x ) Qn 26th February 1919 General Malleson cabled to the General Officer Commanding, Constantinople, asking for 5,000,000 loubles foi the puipose of (1) paying railway workmen ; (2) giving assistance to inhabitants wishing to leave the country on the withdrawal of the Fritish troops from Iranscaspia. The General Officer Commanding cabled this request to the War Office, who strongly supported it, and asked the Foreign Office to obtain Treasury sanction. (10575/19.) (xi) On 13th March 1919 the Foreign Office wrote to the Treasury supporting this proposal as a matter of urgency, and observing that it was coveied by thi recommendations of the Fastern Committee made 8th kebiuary. It \vas suggested that as the proper incidence of cost was m dispute, this question should be settled later. (11413/19.) (xii) On 14th March 1919 the Treasury sanctioned this proposal, the funds to be placed at the disposal of General Malleson at Meshed by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, but it was subsequently arranged that instead the Government of India would supply Persian currency at Meshed through the Imperial Bank of Persia. (11963/19.) ^ ‘ The question of incidence of cost w r as left to a further inter-departmental meeting. (11413/19.) (xiii) On 15th March 1919 the Indian Government cabled details of the expenditure of General Malleson to date, which was as follows . Pay charges - lo,UUU Secret Service, Turkestan _ - - - 37,000 Other Secret Service ----- 13,000 “ Other charges ” - - - - - 5,000 Charges of military forces _ - - - ? Road making ------ 9,000 Payment to Askabad Government for rations supplied - 100,000 Subsidy in December _ - _ _ - 100,000 Maintenance of railway service - - - - 80,000 Payment to Askabad Government in December - - 17,000 Expenses of withdrawal (estimate) - - - 100,000 £476,000 (xiv) On 27th March 1919 the Treasury wrote to the India Office that they concurred in the view of the War Office that “the only charges brought against Army “ Funds in connection with the Mission should be those in connection with the troops “ actually engaged in military operations,” and suggested that as regards the other expenditure, ii which appears to be of a quasi-political chaiactei. the India Office should communicate with the Foreign Office. (12729/19, 13060/19.) (xv) On 30th May 1919 the Government of India cabled to the India Office that the Consul-General, Meshed, wdio had suspended payments from Secret Service on 15th February, asked for replacement of funds at his disposal from 1st June, in view of the Bolshevik and Afghan menace, and that the Government of India were authorising this in anticipation of India Office approval. The India Office (on 16th July) wrote to the Foreign Office proposing, subject to their concurrence, to approve. The Foreign Office (on 28th July) wTote to the Treasury transmitting this correspondence without comment. No action lias been taken on this correspondence. (33112/19.) (xvi) On 29th August 1919 the Foreign Office (who agreed with the War Office and the Treasury as to the part liability of India, but differed from both only on the incidence of the charge as between Foreign Office and Army Votes) challenged thei 7 implication of Treasury Letter 13060/19, produced evidence in support of their view that the expenditure in question was not properly chargeable to Foreign Ollice Votes, and asked for the opinion of the Treasury. The India Office view was recapitulated on 9th August 1919 (in a letter to the Foreign Office) and was to the following effect :— “ The ^Mission was organised at the desire of the War Office ; its object was to combat German-Turkish propaganda ; it had a definite military objective connected with the Transcaspian Railway. “ It must be regarded as primarily military in character, and as the Treasury have agreed that the military expenditure should be charged on Army Funds, the other expenditure, which should be regarded as ancillary to the military expenditure, should be accepted as a charge on Foreign Office Votes.” The Government of India were even more uncompromising :— “ The Mission was wholly military, and it formed part of troops despatched from India for service in the European War. Its charge should be adjusted accordingly with reference to Parliamentary Resolution of 1914, governing incidence of charge of such troops.” The evidence submitted by the India Office to support their view, and interpreted by the Foreign Office as lending support to their view, is contained in the telegrams exchanged between the Secretary of State for India and the \ iceroy from the 4th January to 31 st July 1918, which are filed in 37843/19. The important passages in these telegrams have been marked, and deserve the notice of Ministers. It seems doubtful if anything is to be gained by an attempt to quote or summarise them. The large question at issue as to the incidence of the cost of the Mission, as well as the smaller question as to the source from which Secret Service funds are to be provided, remains undecided. It has been revived by the cable sent by the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy on 20th ultimo ordering an increase in the forces under General Malleson's control (without reference to the Treasury) and the correspondence arising therefrom between the Secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The conclusions which I draw fiom these communications and the whole of the correspondence, which 1 have attempted to review, are as follows :— (1) The Pan-Turanian movement became a political force from the date of the Young Turk Revolution, and the Pan-Islamic movement, which has been used by the Pan-Turanians for their own ends, existed even earlier, and German propaganda, which seeks to utilise both movements, existed before the war, and will continue after its close, and will be reinforced by the revolutionary forces now classed as Bolshevism, which are in part at least due to hunger, want and social and political discomfort. These forces also existed before the war, but they have been increased in intensity as a consequence of the war, and have found freer opportunities of self-expression in the dissolution of existing politics which the war has brought about. All these forces are a direct menace to the Indian Government as they are to all established Governments, but more particularly to the Indian Government because they enlist the forces of religion in the armies of political and social discontent. Further, the contagion has threatened and still threatens both Persia and Afghanistan, States of India, and closely connected with important portions of the Indian community through the brotherhood of Islam. On a broad view, therefore, India had and has a special interest in combating these forces of disruption, which was part of General Malleson’s duties. (2) On the other hand, General Malleson’s Mission had, without question, objects which, while linked up with Indian policy on the north-east and east, were also linked with the general purposes of the war on the west. The position of the British troops in Transcaspia and that of the British troops in the Caucasus were so intimately related that a withdrawal from the Caucasus made a withdrawal from Transcaspia inevitable, and both forces were engaged in fighting as well as observing the Bolsheviks, who may perhaps be described as de facto enemies of the Allied and Associated Powers, though they are in fact at war both with the friends and the enemies of these Powers. (3) Further, General Malleson’s Mission in its inception was one of observation and intelligence; it then became transformed by force of circumstances into one of ^action, the action being of a mixed political and military nature; and it was only8 -when it became obvious that without vigorous whole-hearted military support (which was not forthcoming') all political activities were not only useless but harmful, that it was withdrawn from belligerent to neutral territory. (4) The Mission is now withdrawn within the frontiers of Persian territory, and it has become once more a mission of observation and intelligence, with a view to military action later if and when circumstances render such action inevitable. But whatever may have been its character and objects whilst it was operating in Transcaspia, its object now is clearly to prevent the invasion by hostile elements of Persia and Afghanistan, an object of admitted interest to the Government of India, and its connection with the operations of the war in the Caucasus and the Middle East generally has clearly ceased. (5) Though particular terms of the expenditure incurred by General Malleson m Transcaspia can only be identified as clearly of a military character (c.g., pay of troops) and others as clearly of a political character (e.g., subventions to the quasi- Government of Askabad, &amp;c.), and others again of an intermediate character (e.g., payment to the railway employees of the dranscaspian hailvwiy, essential both to the maintenance and to the withdrawal of the force), 1 doubt whether the utmost skill m political accountancy could arrive at a balance-sheet which would separate the charges effectively. .... -ini (6) Control over the expenditure of the Mission has been exercised by the Government of India (both Political and Military Departments) and the India Office, and by the War Office. Inasmuch as the instrument employed was a military instrument, the intervention of the latter department was both proper and inevitable, but it was not sufficiently pronounced to have a direct bearing on the question of the incidence of charge. . (7) The only recognised principles dividing the responsibility of the British and Indian Governments with respect to (a) the ordinary charges lor military and political activities in the East, and (6) the extraordinary charges arising out of the war, are to be found (a) in the understanding that expenditure arising in Persia and thereabouts which interests India shall be shared equally between the two exchequers, and (b) in the Resolutions of the House of Commons of September 1914. The interpretation of the facts and perhaps also of the principles must be a matter of difficulty, since divergent views are held by three great Government Departments. . India regards the whole Mission as part of the war ; the Foreign Office regards the whole thing as primarily of Indian interest; the War Office regards the cost of military operations alone as a suitable charge against Army Votes ; the Treasury has hitherto leant to the War Office view. (8) In the circumstances, and in order to help towards the solution of a difficulty which has already consumed a great deal of valuable time, I venture to suggest the conclusion that neither the Indian nor the Foreign Office view is consistent with all the facts ; that the Mission was designed to achieve an end both military and political (the political end being of vital interest to India) | that at the time of its taitliest penetration northwards the military aspect of the object in view was perhaps predominant, and that at any rate since the withdrawal to Meshed the political aspect has been predominant; that the degree of control exercised by the Government of jndia and the Commander-in-Chief in India throughout at least justifies the expectation that the Indian Government should share that expense, and that, since the withdrawal the functions of the Mission clearly establish a claim on the part of His Majesty’s Government to relief under the half-and-half principle. (Initialled.) „ A. C. 11th November 1919. 3 .—India Office to Treasury. No. 29860. India Office, g- r 9th January 1920. With reference to Sir George Barstow’s letter of the 25th November, No. 49012, I am directed to refer to the note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the incidence of cost of General Malleson’s Military Mission now at Meshed, sems-officially forwarded by Mr. Bewley on 12th November, and to say that the Secietaiy of State for India in Council is prepared to accept generally the conclusion arrived at in para. 8 of the Chancellor s note, and that he assumes that the Folds9 4 Commissioners of the Treasury will agree to the following statement of the resultant disposal of the cost of this Mission :— (1) Expenditure on the Mission up to the date of the withdrawal to Meshed to be a military charge debitable to Imperial revenues (subject of course-to a contribution from Indian revenues of the normal cost of officers and men of the Indian Establish ment employed in the Mission). (2) As regards the date to be taken as that of withdrawal to Meshed, the facts are :— (a) The Mission has always been at Meshed, though General Malleson and his officers visited Transcaspia where most of his troops were. (b) The last of these troops crossed the border into Persia on 6th April 1919, though all of them did not return to Meshed, and some still are on the frontier, (c) From mid-day of 16th April 1919 the force under General Malleson was transferred from the command of the General Officer Commanding, Constantinople, to that of the Commander-in-Chief, India. From these facts two possible dates emerge, viz., 6th and 16th April 1919, and Mr. Montagu suggests that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury should accept the 16th April 1919 as being the more^suitable date. (3) From the 16th April 1919 subsequent non-military expenditure would accordingly be divisible between Imperial and Indian revenues on the half-and-half principle, subject to the proviso that purely military charges after 16th April 1919 should, as before, be dealt with by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury as agreed to in their letters of 21st August 1916, Xo. 19988, and 27th March 1919 No. 13060.

The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury have had before Them your letter of the 9th ultimo (M. 29865) respecting the incidence of cost of General Malleson’s Mission at Meshed. In reply I am to state that the Secretary of State for India in Council has apparently misapprehended the intention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer as regards the division of cost between India and the Imperial Exchequer as set forth in the memorandum forwarded semi-officially on the 12th November last. The proposal in the concluding paragraph of that memorandum was that in view of the impossibility of making an accurate division of cost between the military and the political side of the Mission, a compromise should be arrived at under which the cost up to the date of the withdrawal to Meshed, which My Lords are prepared to accept as the 16th April 1919, will be borne by Imperial funds subject to the usual deduction in respect of normal military charges which fall on Indian funds, and that as from that date the excess cost of the Mission over the normal charges which fall on India should be borne as to one moiety by the Imperial Exchequer and as regards the remaining moiety by Indian funds. If My Lords rightly understand the intention of Sir A. Hirtzel’s letter, Mr. Montagu proposes that the charges subsequent to the 16th April 1919 should be divided into (a) political and (6) military, and that the Indian revenue should beat- only half the cost of the political charges. The whole argument of the Treasury memorandum was that it is not possible to make an accurate division between political and military charges, and that in consideration of the acceptance by Imperial funds of charges prior to the 16th April 1919, half the total charges for the period subsequent to that date should be borne by the Government of India. My Lords hope to learn that on reconsideration the Secretary of State for India in Council is prepared to accept this compromise. I am, Ac., The Under Secretary of State G. L. Barstow. for India. 3136JO 5. —Treasunj to India Office. No. 12609. Treasury Cliambers, Sir, 17tli Marcli 1920. With reference to the letter from this Department of the 21st February (1636) respecting the incidence of cost of General Malleson's Mission at Meshed, I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to state that in Their view the same principles of division of cost between the British Exchequer and the Government of India should be applied to the other troops in East Persia. These would comprise the lines of communication troops with the Malleson Mission, the Seistan Levies, the Garrisons at Duzdap and Kvasht, &amp;c.

In reply to your letter No. M. 3420, dated 26th March 1920, regarding the withdrawal of Major-General Malleson’s force from Meshed, I am commanded by the Army Council to inform you that they are of opinion that the withdrawal should commence forthwith, and that orders should be issued to this effect. The Council agree to the proposals in the first part of para. 7 of the Viceroy’s telegram, No. 204 S., of the~21st February last. They cannot, however, accept against Army Funds any portion of the cost of the Consular escorts which it is proposed to leave at Meshed and Seistan after the withdrawal of the other troops in East Persia. The retention of these escorts appears to be contemplated as a permanent measure, quite unconnected with any Expeditionary Force or Army of Occupation, and there fore the escorts are on the same footing as troops formerly employed in Persia in peace time with which Army Funds were in no way concerned. If it is urged that Imperial revenues should bear any portion of the cost of these troops, the matter should be taken up with the Foreign Office and the Treasury, to each of which Departments a copy of this letter has. been sent. I am, etc., The Under Secretary of State U. J. Greedy. for India. 7. —Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War. (Circulated to the Cabinet.) When I presented the Army Estimates to the Cabinet, a decision was taken that General Malleson’s force should be “immediately and entirely withdrawn” from Meshed. My Estimates have been framed upon this basis, and I have no funds available, without going again to Parliament, to meet the heavy charge entailed in maintaining this force. I am strongly opposed to its retention, which is regarded both by the War Office and the India Office as unnecessary. I enquired a few days ago what progress had been made in the evacuation of this force. 1 am informed that no progress whatever has been made, as Lord Curzon had requested Mr. Montagu to postpone the withdrawal, and has stated that the “ withdrawal had net been definitely decided upon.” In these circumstances, I do not think the responsibility for asking for further credits from Parliament ought to fall upon me, and 1 consider also that the subject is .one which requires early Cabinet attention. War Office, Winston S. Churchill. 19th April 1920. 8 .— Memorandum by Secretary of State for India, dated 23rd April 1920. (Circulated to the Cabinet.) • In view of the memorandum by the Secretary of State for War, I wish to explain the position of my Office in the matter. In pursuance of what were understood to be the orders of the Finance Committee of the Cabinet, a telegram was sent to the Government of India (with the approval11 of Mr. Fisher, in my absence) on 10th February informing them that the Cabinet were of opinion that all troops should be withdrawn from East Persia. At the same time they were asked for their observations, but it was explained that if the troops were retained for Indian reasons, the whole cost would probably be thrown on India. The Government of India replied on 21st February in favour of withdrawal of the force as such, but my Office, which had agreed with the Foreign Office in strongly deprecating withdrawal, on military and political grounds, were not convinced b\ their arguments, and approached Lord Curzon with a view to submitting the question again to the Cabinet. Lord Curzon asked that a memoiandum should be prepared for his approval, and this necessitated further reference to India to clear up some financial points. Finally, as Lord Curzon was not satisfied with the financial proposals made in India’s behalf, he summoned a meeting of the Inter- llepartmental Conference on Eastern Affairs to discuss the whole question on 17th March. At this meeting Lord Curzon said that “it would assist him very “ much m putting the case before the Cabinet il he could say that the Government of “ India were interested to the extent of 50 per cent.” A telegram had, in fact, been sent to the Government of India on 15th March asking them what was the maximum, reduction m cost which they could effect and to what extent were thej prepaied to face it. Their answer, dated 10th March, was felt to make it impossible for the India Office to approach the Cabinet again, and official letters were accordingly sent to the Foreign Office and War Office on 26th March asking if they concurred that orders should be issued for the immediate commencement of withdrawal. The War Office concurred, but the Foreign Office on 3rd April stated that Lord Curzon could not concur, but wished the matter to be discussed again b} 7 the Inter-Depaitmental Conference! A meeting was therefore held on the eve of Lord Curzon’s departure for San Remo, as the result of which the letters printed below were exchanged between him and me. On receipt of his, I explained the position to Mr. Bonar Law, who decided that no action should be taken until Lord Curzon returned fiom San Remo and could put the case before the Cabinet himself. The Eiqht Hon. E. S. Montagu, M.P., to the Right Hon. the Earl Curzon of Kedleston, K.C., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E. India Office, My dear Curzon, 14th April 1920. Since the meeting yesterday, I have referred to the Minutes of the rinance Committee of the Cabinet of the 9th February. They are quite explicit and clear, and there appears to be nothing contrary to them in the Cabinet Minutes of the 11th February. In accordance with them the India Office telegram announced the decision, while leaving the door open for the Government of India to object, if they chose. The present position, therefore, is that the Cabinet ordered withdrawal on 9th February; that on the strength of that order the War Office have made no further provision in their estimates for the cost of retaining the force ; that the Government of India (with whom I agree) are unwilling to bear it; and that the force has not, in fact, been withdrawn, f think you will agree that this is a position that must be regularised at once, and the only way I see of regulaiismg it, consistently with the views I hold, is to order the withdrawal to be begun at once it will take five months—and this I propose to do, unless you are prepared to take full responsibility (financial and other) for further delay in giving effect to the decision of the Cabinet. . . , I have considered very carefully the possibility of merely reducing the knee, as you suggested. But this has been proposed to the Government of India, who maintain that neither from, the military nor from the political point of view is its retention an Indian interest. I have told the Foreign Office repeatedly that 1 Imd it increasingly difficult to persuade my Council to sanction the expenditure of Indian revenues in Persia; it will be impossible for me to do so when the Government of India themselves disclaim interest in it. . . . You referred to military expenditure before the war, and it is quite true that India paid half the cost of the Consular guards and half the post of the troops sent to Shiraz in 1911. But these troops were not engaged in military operations. Had they been, it would have been necessary for us, under the Government of India Act, to obtain the consent of Parliament. That, I submit, is what differentiates the present case from pre-war precedents. The point is, in fact, under discussion with the Treasury now as regards the cost of Malleson’s force since it withdrew from B 21'J Transcaspia in April 1919. The general consent of Parliament to the expenditure of Indian revenues during the war on military operations outside India was obtained by the Resolutions of 1914, but Indian liability was limited to the so-called “normal cost.’ We accordingly maintain—and I think it is incontrovertible—that the Government of India is debarred by Statute from bearing any part of the cost of Malleson’s military force beyond the “ normal cost ; the political expenditure we are prepared to halve. Aon may like to refer in this connection to India Office letter F. 3044, dated 27th July 1916, to the Tr easury (copy enclosed).’ The Government of India’s recommendation, in which I hope that you, on further consideration, will concur, is as follows :— Hie retention of the Consular escort, one and a half cavalry squadrons at Meshed and half squadron at Seistan, some light armoured cars at Meshed and possibly Ford van transport. Persia to take over Khorasan levies in present strength and Seistan levies in reduced strength, both under British officers ; small regular mobile detach ment at Duzdap ; reduced garrison at Khwas and maintenance of present tribal and levy payments in Sarhad. Of foregoing, cost of Consular escort at Meshed and Seistau,^ including all contingent charges, will be borne half and half by His Majesty’s Government and India, cost of Khorasan and Seistan levies with their officers by Persia. Conditionally on these arrangements we are prepared to meet the cost of Duzdap and Khwas detachments, and payments for this redistribution of cost might have effect when withdrawal of the forces is complete. The cost of the enlarged Consular escorts, being political, will be equally shared with the Joreign Office; that of the Khorasan and Seistan levies (which is at present being entirely borne by British revenues, except as regards the “normal cost ” of the Indian personnel) will be taken over by the Persian Government. I am doubtful whether the cost of the detachments at Duzdap and Khwas can be brought within the spirit of the Resolutions. If I am able, on further enquiry, to satisfy myself that 1 can, I am willing to ask my Council to bear it. Yours sincerely, E. S. Montagu. The Right Hon. the Earl Curzon of Kedlefslov, K.G\, G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., to the Right Hon. E. S. Montagu, M.P. Foreign Office, Dear Montagu, 15th April 1920. As 1 am leaving England in a few hours, I cannot refer to a Cabinet, as I should otherwise certainly do, the question that you have raised about Khorasan. The decision of the Cabinet to which you refer was recorded by the Prime Minister after I had left the room and did not represent the facts as I had heard them. I was not present on the second occasion. If you order the withdrawal of the force from Khorasan you must accept the full responsibility for any consequences that may occur in that quarter. I can accept none. When I alluded to military expenditure in Persia before the war I was not referring to Shiraz but to the cost of frontier levies. Nor can I admit that Malleson’s men are now -engaged in military operations. Since they retired from Transcaspia they have not fired a shot. If India disinterests herself in East Persia (to which she and not we insisted on despatching Malleson’s Mission) the Foreign Office will feel no disposition to recognise, as they have hitherto done, the predominant interest of India in these regions. Yours sincerely, Curzon. 9. —Extract from Minutes of a Cabinet Meeting at 10, Downing Street, on 5th May 1920. With reference to Cabinet 10 (20), conclusion 1, the Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the withdrawal of British troops from Persia :— A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (Paper C.P. 1101). A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India (Paper C.P. 1200), covering a series of telegrams 2 exchanged between the Secretary of State and the Indian Government. 1 Not printed. - See Appendix II., Nos. 27-30.13 It was recalled that on Oth February the Cabinet Committee on Finance had decided, on financial grounds, on the immediate and entire withdrawal of the force of ^approximately 1,700 men at Meshed, under General Malleson, together with the troops on the lines of communication of this force (Cabinet Finance Committee, 10th Minutes, conclusion 3). Both the Foreign Office and India Office had doubted the wisdom of this withdrawal, on military and political grounds, and a series of telegrams had been exchanged with the Indian Government to ascertain whether they were prepared to share the cost of the retention of some force in North Persia. The result of these telegrams had been that the Indian Government favoured withdrawal and could not make any substantial contribution to the maiutenance of this force. On the eve of Lord Curzon’s departure for San Remo the subject had been further considered by the Inter-departmental Conference on Eastern Affairs, as the result of which correspondence had been exchanged between the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. This correspondence had been taken to indicate that the latter was still doubtful as to the expediency of the withdrawal. The issue of final instructions had, therefore, been held over until Lord Curzon’s return. It was explained that the War Office estimates did not provide any funds for the maintenance of the force, and that the Indian Government was unwilling to contribute. The statement of the Indian Government that five months would be required for the withdrawal w^as severely criticised, particularly in view of the fact that the cost in the meantime would fall on War Office funds. The Cabinet agreed— (a) That the Secretary of State for India should inform the Indian Government that the Cabinet had re-affirmed the previous decision that the forces should be withdrawn from Meshed, and should instruct them to withdraw the force as soon as possible, stating that the Cabinet could not accept five months as a reasonable estimate of the time required ; (h) To approve the Government of India’s recommendation as regards the retention of the Consular escorts, namely, 1| cavalry squadrons at Meshed, and } squadron at Seistan, some light armoured cars at Meshed, and possibly Ford van transport. (For action taken on this Cabinet decision, see Nos. 31 and 32, Appendix II.) 10. —The Fight Hon. IF. S. Chur chill to the Flight Hon. E. S. Montagu. War Office, My dear Secretary of State for India, 2Gth May 1920. I have seen the Viceroy’s telegram No. G0G6 of the 13th instant, saying he can give no guarantee to reduce the period of five months estimated to be required to withdraw the troops from East Persia. As I believe you are aware, I have only taken a sum of 2,000,000L in Army Estimates for the current year to cover all charges for troops in South and East Persia. Of course, 1 hold with the Treasury view that the cost of the troops in East Persia is properly one for division between the Indian and Imperial revenues in equal shares, the Imperial share falling on Foreign Office votes, and I understand that this matter is still under official discussion between your office and the Treasury ; but, in case this view is not upheld, I must v^arn you that I cannot agree to bear any additional charge on Army funds in excess of the provision made in my estimates, and I must stipulate that any excess due to the time taken in the withdrawal of these troops from East Persia must fall on Indian revenues. I am circulating a copy of this letter to the Cabinet. Fours sincerely, The Right Hon. the Secretary of State Winston S. Churchill. for India. 11. —The Right Hon. E. S. Montagu to the Right Hon. XV. S. Churchill. India Office, My dear Winston, 1st June 1920. Your letter of 26th May regarding cost of troops in East Persia. As I -explained in my letter of 14th April to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, which was among the papers circulated by me to the Cabinet on 23rd April, I am debarred by Statute from accepting as a charge against Indian revenues the cost of military operations beyond the frontier of India (other than “ normal” charges during1-i the war), and eannot therefore be responsible for the military cost of the Malleson Mission and the troops ancillary to it. The Cabinet did not dissent from this view, as is, I think, made plain by the paragraph in the minutes of 5th May immediately preceding the recorded “ decision ” regarding the withdrawal. In any case it is clear that the fact that insufficient funds have been provided in the Army Estimates cannot be a reason for asking my Council to agree to accepting as a charge against Indian revenues expenditure which under Statute cannot be borne thereby, and expenditure for a force which was not used in Persia for Indian require ments at all. I will ask the Government of India to telegraph a revised estimate of the expendi ture which will fall on the Imperial Government during 1920-21 for troops in South and East Persia. In the meantime I can only guess what the figure will be, but I expect it will be in the neighbourhood of 4,000,000h rather than 2,000,000L sterling, apart from the expenditure f v t° k e shared between Foreign Office and India Office) on “Consular guards” at Meshed and Seistan after completion of the withdrawal. Can your military advisers suggest any steps which could be taken to expedite withdrawal at this season of the year ? I hope to send an official letter to the Treasury shortly on the whole question and will communicate a copy to the War Office. As your letter has been sent to the Cabinet, I am circulating a copy of this also. Yours sincerely, The Right Hon. Winston S. Churchill, M.P. E. S. Montagu. 12 .—The Wight Hon. IF. S. Churchill to the Right Hon. E. S. Montagu. War Office, My dear Secretary of State for India, 2nd July 1920. You wrote to me on the 1st June, in reply to a letter of mine, about the- incidence of the charge for troops in East Persia, and the correspondence is before the Cabinet. In the hope that we may arrive at a final settlement of this vexed question, I have had an official letter (of which a copy is enclosed) sent to the Treasury, which Department, I understand, will bring the matter up for decision. You will see that we do not admit at all that you are debarred by Statute from bearing part of the charges in question. I am afraid that my military advisers are not in a position to share the responsi bility of saying how the troops in question should be withdrawn. Yours, &amp;c.. The Right Hon. E. S. Montagu, M.P. Winston S. Churchill. 13 .—War Office to Treasury. No. 0102/346. (F. 1.) War Office, S_[ r5 18th June 1920. The Army Council have before them a letter of the 1st instant (copy enclosed), addressed by the Secretary of State for India to the Secretary of State for War, and circulated by the former to the Cabinet, on the subject of the charge for the troops in South and East Persia, including General Malleson’s Mission. The Government of India Act lays down that “ the revenues of India shall not, “ without the consent of both Houses of Parliament, be applicable to defraying the “ expenses of any military operation carried on beyond the external frontiers of “ India.” But no military operations are now in question, and in the opinion of the Army Council it would be as proper to charge the whole or a part of the cost of these troops to Indian revenues as it was before the war, when the cost of troops in Persia was shared equally between the Government of India anti the Foreign Office. This view was placed before the Treasury in War Office letter 0162/315 (F. 1) of 27th September last, and is supported in Lord Curzon’s letter of the 15th April last to Mr. Montagu (also circulated to the Cabinet). The Council wish, therefore, to record their dissent from the India Office view and to express their hope that that Department may be pressed to accept the proposal placed before them in Treasure letters of 21st February (1636) and 17th March (12609). I am, &amp;c., B. B. Cubitt. The Secretary, Treasury.15 14. —India Office to Treasury. India Office, •Sir, lOtli November 1920. I am directed to refer to your letters of 21st February, 1636, and IIth March, 12609, regarding expenditure on the Malleson Mission. It is understood from these letters that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury do not dispute the contention of this Office that the Secretary of State for India in Council is debarred by Statute from defraying the expenses of military operations outside India, subject to the permission given by the Parliamentary Resolution of 26th November 1914, for the “ normal ” cost of troops sent from India during the war to be borne by Indian revenues (see, for example. India Office letter to Treasury, F. 3044, of 27th July 1916, copy enclosed), 1 but that in view of the difficulty of differentiating between the military and non-military charges of the Mission, they would propose that, Avitli effect from the 16th April 1919, half the total cost of •General Malleson’s Mission and of the other troops in East Persia should be borne by India. Some portion of the cost is clearly military. Their Lordships will remember that the most important object served by General Malleson’s force was the protection of North-East Persia from Bolshevik incursion, and the fact that this object was attained without actual fighting was due to the strength of his force and its supporting troops and does not remove its proceedings from the category of “military operations.” The admitted difficulty of deciding precisely how much of the cost is military cannot release the Secretary of State from his statutory obligation not to share the military expenditure in excess of the normal, and accordingly, after consulting the Government of India, he will submit definite proposals framed on broad lines for dividing into military and non-military the expenditure on the Mission and the other troops in East Persia, from 16th April 1919 until completion of withdrawal of the Mission. As already stated, half the non-military expenditure will be admitted as a charge against Indian revenues. As the Lords Commissioners are no doubt aware it has been necessary in various cases to assess on broad lines the portions of military expenditure incurred in the Indian Expeditionary Forces that are chargeable to the Imperial and Indian Governments, respectively. Mr. Montagu presumes that the classification of the expenditure is now the only outstanding question regarding the Malleson Mission, as he understands that the Cabinet on the 5th May did not dissent from the view that the Government of India could not share the extraordinary military charges. As regards the incidence of charges after the withdrawal from Meshed has been ■ completed, Mr. Montagu has submitted the following proposals to the Cabinet :— (1) The cost of the enlarged Consular escorts at Meshed and Seistan, being political, to be shared between the Government of India and the Foreign Office. (2) The cost of the Khorasan and Seistan levies (including officers) to be borne by the Persian Government. (3) The cost of the detachments [it Duzdap and Khwas to be borne by the Government of India provided that, on examination, this proposal did not prove contrary to the Statute. The final decision as regards (2) must depend on the recommendations of the Persian Military Commission and the agreement reached with the Persian Government. As regards (3) the Secretary of State for India in Council is now satisfied that as the detachments at Duzdap and Khwas are proposed as a semi-permanent measure they need not be regarded as stationed there for the purpose of military operations, and that he is not debarred from accepting their cost as a charge against Indian revenues. It would, however, be in accordance with usual practice that the cost of these detachments should be shared on the half-and-half principle, and Mr. Montagu would now prefer that this modification should be made in the proposals laid before the Cabinet. He presumes from Treasury letter of 17th March, 12609/20, that the Lords Commissioners would have no objection. The Government of India have been asked to telegraph a provisional rough estimate of the cost of troops in South and East Persia, which will, in accordance with 1 Not printed.10 the above principles, fall outlie Imperial Government for the years 1919-20 and 1920-21. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office .and War Office. Yours, Ac., The Secretary, Treasury. A.

It will do you a tremendous amount of harm in the present economy feeling, and it will be pointed out that you were spending without control the British taxpayers’ money. The writer estimates the cost of the Expedition at 100,000,000/., the word “ economy ” being absolutely ruled out; talks of 600 miles of derelict barracks, ice-houses, temples and swimming baths ; of miles of road which were never used. If this not true, have any steps been taken to contradict it in India ? 17 .—Tdeyr a m from Viceroy to Secretary of State, Army Department, dated I3th December 1920. 526. Your telegram dated 3rd December, No. 3814, and 3982, dated 11th December. Following are approximate figures of cost of Malleson Mission proper in thousands of £ sterling; 1918-19, 500; 1919-20, 100; and 1920-21, 50. Figures are only approximate, as no separate accounts of Mission proper are available at headquarters. Total cost of troops in South and East Persia is 11,304 in 1919-20 and 5,100 in 1920-21. These fi gures include approximately for cost of troops in Fast Persia, inclusive of Malleson Mission proper, 8,000 in 1919-20 and 4,500 in 1920-21. Here, too, actual figures cannot be given as accounts received at headquarters are for East and South Persia together. It is not possible to give readily similar figures before 1919-20, as separate accounts by theatres were not compiled before that year. 2. Our estimates of recoverable war expenditure, as telegraphed to you on 13th November last, make no allowance for contribution of India towards cost of Malleson Mission proper. 3.

Your telegrams 1539 (sic) (? 3814) dated 3rd December, and that of 9th December. Meshed Expedition. 1. We characterise the article as a malicious exaggeration. Though described as a wild venture and a gigantic piece of bluff, force in North-East Persia acquitted itself successfully, and proved adequate for the purpose for which it was intended.17 l. From figures supplied to you in my telegram 520, dated 1.3th December, it is evident that figures of annual and total cost of troops in East Persia have been greatlv exaggerated by writer of the article. 3. As regards financial aspect, Financial Advisers to General Officer Com manding were posted to Birjand and Meshed early in 1919, though General Officers exercised, under Field Service Regulations, full powers of sanctioning expenditure in field. A Financial Officer was also specially sent by us to Birjand and Meshed in November 1919 to examine and report on expenditure on roads and buildings during preceding 12 months. His report was generally satisfactory, and a summary of it is being (? telegraphed) separately. 4. As regards certain statements in detail— (a) In Turbat-i-Haidari troops were originally quartered in town, but owing to outbreak of cholera it became necessary to build cantonments outside. As the ground was covered with many feet of snow, mud buildings could not then be undertaken. Building was (? commenced) in stone, but when weather permitted remaining buildings were made in mud. All other buildings along lines of communication were of a temporary nature only. It must be remembered that temperature in this country varies from 120 in the shade to 10 degrees below zero; adequate accommodation was therefore essential. (b) Dixon Avenue consists of a half mile diversion of road necessitated by fact that the original road passing through town was unsuitable and impossible of improvement. r l he trees planted along this road were free gift from a Persian gentleman and cost nothing. (c) It is untrue that majority of (? cantonments) were looted after their evacuation. Owing to failure of Persian police to guard them as promised, some buildings in Meshed were looted when our troops left, but very little damage was done, and buildings are now guarded by levies. (d) Statement about (? Ford) cars is a gross exaggeration. All derelict cars of slightest value were towed into railhead. 5. In view of comment raised here and at home, we propose to put out above aspect of the case unofficially in various newspapers. 20.

Total cost, including works, of troops in East Persia from 1915-10 to end 1920-21 is calculated roundly at 10,500,0000, of which approximately 650,0000 repiesents expenditure on works, that is to say, roads and accommodation, including about 100,0000 for expenditure in India. It is impossible to give (? separately) expenditure on road from railhead in Baluchistan to Meshed. -. An estimate ol cost oi total programme of building was called for by us in July 1919 and the result (? was) reported to you in telegram No. 13891, dated 45th Octobei 1919, in which we informed you that the total estimated cost of 3136 c18 hutting under construction was hs. 56 lakhs, of which about 19 lakhs had been expended by 1st August 1919. Estimates were not strict estimates of ordinary peace time procedure. They were estimates of the character which it was possible to (? obtain) under field service conditions and on which it was found necessary to rely in other field service areas beside East Persia. 3. In the same telegram, 13th October 1919, we asked for orders which would enable us to avoid as far as possible unnecessary expenditure on hutting, and in my telegram No. 12655 dated 16th September 1919, we had also asked for orders on the subject of accommodation to be provided. We received no specific answer to these telegrams; but in your telegram No. 4118, dated 20th October 1919, you authorised certain arrangements to be made for winter accommodation, clothing and supplies. You will see that expenditure as now reported corresponds fairly closely to extimate for 1919. 4. The scale of accommodation for Indian troops provided in East Persia was only about two-thirds of that allowed in plains in India. One bedroom was provided for each officer, (? magnitude) 15 feet by 14 to 12 feet by 12 feet, and a Bengal bathroom and generally a small mess house with only sufficient room to seat the officers in the station was provided. The reference to the swimming baths can, as far as we can judge on the information available here, only be a grotesque and malicious exaggeration of certain arrangements made at Korin and Shusp. At the former place water was let into an existing excavation in the ground, which was then used for bathing. At Shusp, which was the sanatorium of the lines of communications, a small reservoir was formed by damming a stream primarily to increase water available for growing vegetables lor the troops. This reservoir was incidentally used for bathing. 5. The accusation regarding temples is equally untrue. At Birjand the men themselves constructed a small masjid and a Sikh gurdwara in their leisure hours. The buildings were of the most rudimentary description and no Government materials were used. Similar structures may have been built elsewhere on the line, but they were not built at the expense of Government. 6. The statement regarding ice houses has no foundation in fact of which we are aware. It is possible in the northern part of the line, where snow falls in winter, underground storage in pits for snow may have been constructed similar to those which are used in certain parts of India. Any expenditure incurred in construction of such pits could only be negligible, but we have no knowledge that any such was . actually incurred. 7. The provision of buildings for accommodation of troops was necessary for the maintenance of efficiency. The maximum temperature ranges from 125° in hot weather to many degrees below freezing point in the cold weather. The prevalence of dust storms makes some form of protection necessary, as it is impossible to cook and eat in the open, and tents are insufficient against heat stroke as was proved by the number of cases prior to the erection of buildings. Owing to severe cold in the winter it was essential to provide some reasonably comfortable accommodation for (? troops) to prevent their entering the Persian villages for sake of warmth. These villages are incredibly filthy, and tick fever, (? baltic) fever and typhus are (? prevalent). The incidence of disease would have been extremely heavy had these buildings not been provided, whereas percentage of serious sick cases during the (withdrawal) was under 2 per cent, of the whole of the personnel in (? East) (? Persia). We have in our possession photographs of certain of the buildings erected on the East Persian Line, which effectively dispose the idea that the scale or form of buildings was extravagant, and we propose to forward these to you by Secretary’s letter. o. 17e are also sending you by post the relevant portions of financial officer’s report referred to in para. 3 of my telegram No. 568 of 19th December, in lieu of telegraphic summary there promised.19 (c APPENDIX I. 1 .—India Office io Treasury. India Office, gj,. 14th August 1918. I am directed bv the Secretary of Staie for India to forward for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, copy of a No. 1CM83, .&gt;nl August 1918. telegram 1 from the Government of India, Army Department, regarding the provision of funds, for purposes of secret service expenditure, to the British Military Mission at Meshed under General Malleson. Mr. Secretary Montagu presumes that the Lords Commissioners will agree that expenditure such as that contemplated in the Viceroy’s telegram, together with all other charges incurred by General Malleson’s Mission or by the troops under his command, should be debited to Imperial revenues as part of the extraordinary expenses of the war. But it appears to him open to question whether such charges are properly recoverable from Army Funds, or whether application for the amounts expended should be made through the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs or direct to your Department. He would be glad to learn Their Lordships’ wishes on this point. Copies of this letter are being communicated to the Foreign Office and \\ ar Office. I am, &amp;c., The Secretary, Treasury. J. E. Shuckburuh. Enclosure in above. Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 3rd August 1918. 103811. We have authorised Malleson at his request to draw on Minister, Tehran, for such funds as he may require for secret service expenditure. Such expenditure Avill be debited to War Office in war accounts along with other charges of Malleson, and troops under him. 2 .—Treasury to India Office. Treasury Chambers, gi r&gt; 14th November 1918. I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Mi*. Shuckburgh’s letter of the 14th Aug'ust last (P. 3354), respecting the incidence of cost of the Military Mission at Meshed. Their Lordships’ authority has not been sought for this expenditure, the amount of which They would be glad to learn, but They understand that, although the Mission is described as “Military,” its activities are in the main political. The general policy of the Mission is summed up in a memorandum by Sir H. Cox, dated the 23rd April last (E.C. 182) in these words :— “ We should not only continue and increase our present efforts to block the routes through Persia effectively, but we must make a determined attempt to organise resistance to an invading force from the west, along the railway from the Caspian to the Afghan border, between now and next winter. This can only be done by utilising any nucleus there may be in that part of the world which is inclined to stand for' us and for law and order, and by supplying any such nucleus with money, arms, and possibly instructors.” In so far as the Mission aims at influencing or organising the population of a part of Persia, expenditure thereon would seem properly to be divisible between Indian and Imperial funds in the same way as the expenditure on the South Persia Rifles, and on subsidising the Persian Government, tribal chieftains. &amp;c., which likewise was occasioned by the existence of a state of war outside Persia. My Lords trust that, on reconsideration of the nature of the Mission, the Secretary of State for India in Council will accept this view, which is in accordance with the general principle that, in view of the interest of India in Persian affairs, expenditure in that country, other than expenditure upon troops from the Indian establishment employed there during the war, is divided equally between India and Great Britain. I am, Ac., The Under Secretary of State T. L. Heath for India. 2a -—War Office to India Office. War Office, gi r 15th January 1919. I am commanded by the Army Council to i*efer to Treasury letter 31769 of the 14th November last, a copy of which was forwarded to this Office, relative to the cost of the Military Mission at Meshed, and to say that they would be glad to learn that the necessary instructions have been given to secure that the oidy charges brought against Army funds in connection with this Mission shall be those in connection with the troops actually engaged in military operations.

C 220 My Lords note that in view of the urgency of ilie situation the Indian Government have authorised General Malleson to giant to the Transcaspia Government such financial assistance as is absolutely necessary. In view of the fact that, as Mr. Secretary Montagu is aware, His Majesty's Government has decided to place a limit of 100,000/, upon the expenditure to lie incurred in connection with this expedition, My Lords presume that the financial assistance referred to is covered by this amount, and 1 am to point out that Their Lordships have not undertaken to be responsible for any excess beyond this sum. I am, therefore, to suggest that General Malleson should be asked to furnish by telegraph an exact statement of his expenditure under all heads up to the date on which General Milne assumed command of the expedition. I am, tfcc., The Under Secretary of State John Bradbury. for Jndia. 5.-~Telegram from Secretory of State for Indio to Viceroy, Army 1 department, dated 29th January 1919. 434.

India Office, Sir, 20th February 1919. In reply to Sir T. Heath's letter of the 14th November, 31709 18, 1 am directed to inform you that the Secretary of State for India in Council regrets that he is unable to accept the view of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury that expenditure on the Military Mission at Meshed should be divided between Imperial and Indian funds.* It was no part of the Mission’s aim to influence or organise the population of Persia. It was designed to establish an intelligence centre for watching events in Russian Central Asia with the ultimate object of intervention in that region if circumstances required or permitted. It definitely assumed after a time the form of a military mission, but, throughout, its object was to counteract Germano-Bolshevik developments in Central Asia. In the light of the explanation now furnished of the object of the Mission, Mr. Montagu trusts that the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury will accept as a charge upon Imperial revenues all •expenditure on the Mission other than ordinary charges of officers or men of the Indian Army employed on it, which would be chargeable to India under the terms of the Parliamentary Resolution. 'I'he Government of India are being asked to furnish an account of expenditure on the Mission. In . ™ j i t this connection I am to enclose a cony of a letter 1 received from the W ar Office. Copies of this letter are being communicated to the Foreign Office and ‘War Office. I have, &amp;c., J. H. Skahrookk, The Secretary, Treasury.

Foreign Office, Sir, 4th March 1919. 1 am directed by Earl Curzon of Kedleston to refer to the letter addressed by the India Office to your Department on 20th February, relating to the incidence of the expenditure on the Mission of Meshed. 2. Lord Curzon regrets that he is unable to agree with the account of the objects of the expenditure contained in the letter under reference. In His Lordship’s opinion the Mission was Indian both in its inception and in its composition. It was, moreover, intended in the main to serve Indian ends, viz., to prevent enemy agents from penetrating into Central Asia and causing trouble in Afghanistan. 3. In these circumstances Lord Curzon considers that the expenditui’e incurred on the Expedition should not fall upon this Office. 4.

India Office, My dear Chamberlain, 5th November 1919. 1 am in receipt of your letter of the 27th October regarding the incidence of the cost of reinforcing Malleson’s Mission. It was agreed, in Treasury letter of 27th March, 130G0, that the cost of the troops actually engaged in military operations should be charged to Army funds. The measures sanctioned in the telegram to which you refer are of that'nature, and aie therefore so chargeable. I much regret that your department was not consulted, if that course was necessary. You will see, from the correspondence which I enclose, that the proposal to reinforce Malleson was communicated to the War Office and the Foreign Office, and received their approval. It is not usual, as you are aware, for the India Office to correspond direct with the Treasury regarding expenditure, military or political, in Persia, and 1 am afraid that in the present case we took it for granted that the War Office had taken whatever steps might be necessary, seeing that the expenditure was chargeable to Army funds before they concurred. The correspondence enclosed will, I hope, convince you that the measure was absolutely necessary, and, m order to prevent misunderstandings in future, I am sending a copy of this letter to Churchill.

Following is appreciation of situation in Russian Turkestan:— “Owing to collapse of Central Government in Russia and complete breakdown of discipline in Russian Army, all effective control over native population in Turkestan has been removed. His Ma jesty’s Ambassador has reported strong anti-British feeling among Russian Moslems generally, and enemy known to be making determined efforts to arouse fanaticism of local Muhammadans and to excite hostility to Great Britain. These efforts, reinforced by Bolshevik policy, have already considerable success. Turco-German Mission with Hentig believed to be on its way to Turkestan, if not already arrived. Movement is spreading to Persia, where democratic party, already bitterly hostile to us, is likely to be greatly strengthened and encouraged. There is serious danger that Turkestan may fall entirely under Tnrco-German influence, and may be made base for despatch of enemy agents in large numbers or even organised bodies of armed enemy prisoners across frontier into Persia and Afghanistan. Amir ha,s sufficient experiences of German emissaries to realise danger of serious increase in their activities, which could only be directed towards embroiling him with British Government and compelling him to abandon attitude of strict neutrality which he has maintained so wisely and honourably through out war. It will be in his own interests no less than ours to prevent such unwelcome intruders from entering his country.” 3 .—Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State fin- India, dated 8th January 1918. 310 Your telegram of the 4th instant, No. 33883. 1. Our present information regarding situation in Turkestan is not sufficient for a considered opinion, but there does not appear to be any sort of Government to which a mission would be helpful as well as useful to us, particularly as mission should be in answer to a definite request.2. Difficulty of communications precludes maintenance and also effective military support should this become necessary. s n &gt; •&gt;. \\ nli the knowledge at our disposal, therefore, it would not seem a practical proposition to despatch the organisation you suggest. Hut we think it would be advisable to make all preparations in regard to personnel, etc., so that, in case a demand should arise, we should be able to proceed without delay. l Have you any suggestions as to suitable officers? 4.

Absence of regular Government regarded as argument for, rather th against, Mission, and effective military support not considered essential provided officers chosen of initiative and enterprise, and are plentifully supplied with funds.

Preliminary arrangements should be made at once as proposed in your telegram. 5—Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 2)id February 1918. 1251 Reference to your unnumbered telegram dated 25th Januarv. To deal with the problem proposed by the War Office, it is considered by us that the best results would, be attained by establishing two centres from which, as opportunity offered, missions or emissaries could be sent into Russian Turkestan ; the one at Meshed dealing with all the country west of Oxus and tlie plain country of Bokhara, the other based on Kashgar dealing with Ferghana and Samarcand in wdnch provinces autonomy appears to be commenced. A double base of operations has the obvious -advantage that if one line is to be abandoned, work on the other can still proceed. Secondly, the following considerations have induced us to deal with this problem from two directions Meshed is more accessible from India by road and telegraph ; lies close to the west portion of area it is’ desired to influence, and the presence there of our Consul and Military Attache should facilitate the -organisation of an expanded system and movement of our agents where it may be considered desirable On the other hand, without entering Afghanistan, which is not now expedient, move across Transcaspia to the Oxus and Bokhara is practically restricted to the railways, and these, so far as we know are in hands of the Maximalists, vide Redl’s telegram repeated M.I. under C.G.S., No. 7102, dated 27th January. Kashgai is less accessible than Meshed, but the well-established cousulate there under Macartney should prove very valuable for enabling us to establish touch through agencies with representatives of the provinces which concern us. and also as a convenient centre from which to provide agents and funds if this suggestion commends itself to the Government. We do not conceive that any opposition would be offered by Chinese Government. Thirdly, to take charge of Meshed Mission, we propose to send General Malleson, who is on leave in this country. He has a wide theoretical knowledge of Central Asia from having served for several years in the Intelligence Branch at Army Headquarters, and has special qualifications as an organiser of secret service. Steps can be taken to define his position vis-a-vis Grey and Redl, whose headquarters are now at Meshed. * ^ Fourthly, we are considering Lieutenant-Colonel Dew for charge Kashgar Mission. He has previous knowledge of the Gilgit Agency, which should be helpful and is otherwise well qualified for work in front •of him. Fifthly, we cannot provide subordinates as fully qualified in languages as we would wish but are selecting officers otherwise fitted for the duties to be performed, and will officially provide suitable travelling companions to assist these officers in their journeys and work. Sixthly, the possibility of obtaining persons qualified for Mohamedan propaganda is being examined Was doubtful utility of natives of India for the work, and will probably have to draw our agents from close to the area of operations. Seventhly, preliminary action on the above lines is in progress pending your concurrence 6 .—Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, Foreign Department, dated 7th March 1918.

If such authority were guveu officers on crossing’ frontier should probably proceed in a noitheily oi north-westerly or even a north-easterly direction, provided always that their movements were not in neighbourhood of Afghan frontier or calculated to arouse susceptibilities of Amir.

As a matter of policy His Majesty’s Government is desirous of wdhdmwmg Malleson to Meshed. His telegrams M.D. 01280 of 1st January, 01288 of 2nd January, M.D. 01286 ot 3rd January and M D 01301 of 6th Januarv indicate that successive local Governments formed cannot stand 'itimu financial assistance, which, as'you are aware, it is very difficult to find a means ot providing, and H.s Majesty’s Government are not prepared to provide this indefinitely. But the following military reasons for retention of Malleson’s force in present position are urged : fl) Prevention of incursion of Bolsheviks into Persian territory. (2) The containing of the Bolshevik force opposite him and neutralising their possible action against rear of Orenburg Cossacks. (3) Collection and evacuation of Austro-German released prisoners of war. Protection of Krasnovodsk from Fast, including hold on Transcaspian Railway.

In this connection please see our 16538. 10th December. 3. Milne’s visit to Malleson is a new factor and we agree that it is desirable that no withdrawal should take place until Milne and Malleson have had their conference. 4 We welcome Milne's proposed visit as we feel that a second opinion from such a high authonty will enable us to advise His Majesty’s Government with greater confidence as to future pohej. Ins involves Mallesou remaining where he is for another month. In view of situation as disclosed m Malleson’s recent telegrams, it is obvious that he cannot remain there unless he is authonsed to ni further temporary financial assistance to the Transcaspian Government. In view of these considerations and extreme gravitv and urgenev of the, situation, we have taken responsibility of authorising Malleson to grant them such*assistance as is absolutely necessary.

Army Departmeut, dated 9th, February 1919. (1) His Majesty's Government liave had before them Milne’s report on Transcaspian situation and considered opinion on it by General Staff. It is quite dear that after prolonged trial and much financial and military assistance from us the local Government is as helpless as ever, while the military situation has become less favourable to them and us by the fall of Orenburg. This last will shortly open direct rail communication between Moscow and Tashkent, which will not onlv permit of Bolshevik reinforcement, but will capture the trade by which alone Government had any hope of revenue. (2) His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to sanction the military reinforcements necessary to keep Malleson’s force where it is or to admit of advance to line of Oxus. They consider present situation impossible, especially as since coup d’etat Malleson appears to be virtually in charge of Government, a position which it is most undesirable to prolong. (3) His Majesty’s Government have therefore decided that unless vou see grave reasons against it. War Office shall direct Milne to order commencement withdrawal as soon as possible. (4) They consider this withdrawal must be conducted deliberately in order to afford anv of our friends who would find it dangerous to remain, ample opportunity to get away. (5) They are of opinion that withdrawal should be to Meshed, from which place Malleson’s force can protect North-East Persia from Bolshevik incursion, ft is suggested that a detachment at Bujnurd or Kuchan might assist in this. (tij Malleson and his force will come under you for supply and all other purposes on arrival Meshed. (7) His Majesty’s Government have decided that it is necessary to pay the railway establishment till withdrawal from rail is complete, including arrears. Method of effecting payment is under consideration. (8) His Majesty’s Government approve Milne’s suggestion as to handing over arms and ammunition to friendly Turkomans. (9) Instructions to Milne await your reply, which please send earliest possible moment. 24.— Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 17/A September 1919. 12655.

Total estimated cost of hutting under construction in East and the North-East Persia is 56 lakhs, of which 19 lakhs had been expended by 1st August. Programme provides for accommodation for six squadrons and five battalions at and between railhead and Meshed, together with necessarv hospitals, offices, workshops, Ac. If any reduction in garrison is contemplated in near future, it is most desirable that we should receive early intimation to enable us to avoid expenditure on unnecessary hutting. 26.— Telegram from Secretary of State for India to 1 'iccroy, Army Department, dated 20/A October 1919. 4118. Your telegrams of 28th August, 11762, of 10th September, 12358. and of 17th September, 12655. Role of Malleson’s force is correctly described by you in third paragraph of vour telegram. Although touch with events in Central Asia could possibly be adequately kept by small intelligence organisation, it is certain that new Persian force cannot be ready for several months to perform duties of protecting Persia against Pan-lslamic and Bolshevik influence and affording support to Transcaspians. Withdrawal of Mallesou’s force from Meshed would leave North-East Persia at mercy of Bolsheviks next spring and might render pressure on Afghanistan more feasible. The difficulty and expense of expelling Bolsheviks from these regions would be infinitely greater than of pivventing their ingress. I consider measures should now be taken by you to enable Malleson’s force to be increased to one regiment cavalry, one battery artillery, and two battalions infantry. Above striking force to be mobile and irrespective of lines of communication formations. Arrangements for winter for accommodation, clothing supplies, should be made accordinglv. In addition aeroplanes will be necessary. The Duzdap-Meshed road would have to be kept fit foi continuous light motor traffic. I agree that there is no necessity for Malleson to visit Teheran. 27 -—Telegram from Secretary &lt;f State for India to Viceroy, Army Department, dated 10/A February 1920. My telegram of 4th February, 428. Eastern Military Policy. Cabinet have had under consideration the military position in South and East Persia. They are of opinion that all troops in these areas should be recalled. This would involve total withdrawal of Malleson not merely to Birjand but altogether, and also of all troops on his lines of communication in Persia. Grounds of Cabinet view are that cost is altogether too excessive, see your telegram, Finance 1801 C.W.C. of 30th December,* in view of the fact that Malleson would be quite unable to resist any serious attack in force. Have you any observations ? If you consider the retention of a force anv where in Eastern Persia essential in view of the Afghan situation or other Indian political interests, pie ’se make recommendations, but you must understand that if troops are retained on any such grounds, qm stion will be treated as purely an Indian one, and the whole cost probably thrown on India. * 3136 No. 27 a.

East Penan. —Ceneral Officer Commanding, Quetta I )ivision, estimates that withdrawal will take five months to complete as length of route and lack of water necessitate withdrawal in small echelons. If it began in March w hen snow has melted, it might thus not be complete until August. b. Khorasau .— From purely military standpoint dangers to be apprenhended to Khorasnn are either Bolshevik attack in force or Afghan attack. As you point out, Malleson s force could not resist serious Bolshevik attack, and though its withdrawal as far as Birjand only would enable it to remain menace to Bolsheviks, its maintenance there would become excessively inconvenient, as it would be deprived of local supplies now obtainable round Meshed. Regarding Afghan attack on Khorasan, this, if it w r ere to constitute casus ttellf between British Government and Afghanistan, could be best met by attacking Afghanistan from side of India, although immediate power to ward off Afghan attacks on Persian side would be lessened by withdrawal. Malleson considers main military value of present position at Meshed is as outpost bridge over Central Asia. Maintenance of our present military intelligence system could be secured bv leaving Military Attache in Khorasan with small escort to Consulate and two or three British officers. Thus, so far as military considerations are concerned, w ithdrawal is unobjectionable 4. From political standpoint we offer following observations:—(I) Although we recognise that Anglo-Persian agreement does not technically commit British Government to defence of present Persian retjime, public opinion in the Mast almost certainly hold that llis Majesty's Government are morally committed, as was foretold in our telegram of 480 &gt;&gt;.. dated 24th April 1919. Bolsheviks mav not contemplate early military attack on Persia, but there is undoubtedly in Persian eyes distinct threat of such attack, and for llis Majesty's Government to w ithdraw all forces in the face of this threat, may expose them to charges of breach of faith, and react on position not only in Persia but in Afghanistan, making our relations w ith latter more difficult. \\ Idle jaunting this out we do not wish to base any recommendation on it, since maintenance of British repntation in Persia is not mainly Indian interest and effect on our relations with Afghanistan, though jiossibly important, can only be indirect. (2) More imminent and real danger is that Bolsheviks, while abstaining from military attack, w ill Hood Khorasan with emissaries and propagandas, with object of causing armed risings against local Persian Adminis tration w hich they represent to be under British domination. This danger has so far been averted by presence of British forces at Khorasan, though Malleson now reports signs of fraternisation of Persian Customs officials and gendarmerie with Bolsheviks. Rebellion of Khorasan at Bolshevik instigation would jtrobably affect the British jiosifion at Teheran, reacting on Afghanistan almost as much as Bolshevik military attack. We believe that planger of sucli risings would be lessened if fairly strong escorts were left for Meshed Consulate, and if Khorasan levies were to remain under British officers, but* to be paid for by Persian Government (f and if so) incorporated in new uniform force. There would, of comse, be danger that levies might become infected with Bolshevism and attack their British officers, but if we are to make any attenijit to put drags on Bolshex ising of Khorasan. we fear this risk must be faced. This measure, coujded with fact that withdrawal of British regular forces cannot be conniiete Gil August, may tide over dangerous period of next spring and summer. 5. Tract between Birjand and Duzdap There are 1.750 Seistan levies under British officers in this tract. Many of them former noted raiders, and their sudden disbandment would encourage Afghan raiding on British trade caravans and produce disorder in country. Consul at Seistan recommends retention of fairly strong Seistan Consular cavalry escort and gradual disbandment of such of Seistan levies (corrupt group) as cannot be absorbed into new uniform force jmyable by Persia. We jmopose to retain small mobile detachment at Duzdap to jiroteet the railhead and dumps of goods there. &lt;&gt;. Sarhad and (corrupt g’ouj)) Baluchistan Sarhad tribes are kept in order by small garrison at Khwas* and by tribal subsidies and Sarhad levy |&gt;ayments. Khwas Garrison also dominates Bamjmr, and its withdrawal without substitution of Persian authority which does not exist might encourage Bahrain Khan to uejieat his raid uj&gt;on British cantonment. We wish for the jiresent to maintain reduced regular garrison at Khwas and continue tribal subsidies and levy payments. 7. Mxact wording of the summary. We recommend the retention of the Consular escort, one-and-a- half Cavalry Squadrons at Meshed and half Squadron at Seistan. some light armoured cars at Meshed and possibly Ford van transport. Persia to takeover Khorasau levies in present strength and Seistan levies in reduced strength, both under British officers: small regular mobile detachment at.

Your telegram of 21st February, 204 S. Malleson's force. We regard with grave misgiving reduction to the extent you contemplate, which will be interpreted by all parties as equivclent to with drawal and therefore will have evil consequences of withdrawal. Kvidence from all sources seem to indicate that if existing situation can be maintained a little longer Bolshevik-.\tghan relations are likely to be strained to breaking-point. On the other hand, the Cabinet evidently regard the present cost as prohibitive, and unless it can be substantially reduced their decision, which still holds the field, will certainly be m lintained. 1 suggest that as policy in event of organised Bolshevik attack on Persia is tor our military forcer not to involve themselves, Malleson's force might still play its role if it were again reduced to size prior to recent reinforcements or even below it. Similarly, might not strength on line of communications be •considerably reduced ? If this is so, what is maximum reduction in cost that you can effect, and to what •extent are you prepared to share it in view of your interest in maintaining stable situation in Persia and Afghanistan Please reply with least possible delay. Clear the line as matter is most urgent. 30.-7W, u/ratn from Vicerot/. Army Department, to the Sccrelat t/ of Slate for Indio, dated VMh March 1920. .4721. Your telegram of the loth instant. Fast Persia, in view of your statement in previous telegram that Cabinet consider all forces should be withdrawn, we do not fully understand misgiving with which you now contemplate withdrawal, as no- new factors have arisen. Nor are we able to follow contention that if existing situation can be main tained a little longer, Bolshevik-Afghan relations are likely to be strained to breaking point. We do not see why retention of force should accelerate ruptuiv, but on contrary it could be argued with equal reason that our withdrawal would tend to piomote friction by removing one of chief causes which at present serves to unite Bolsheviks and Afghans. We adhere to view expressed in our Foreign Depart ment telegram Xo. 204 S., 21st February, that, so far as India is concerned, retention of Malleson's force is unnecessary from strictly military standpoint, since it is incapable of resisting serious Bolshevik attack. Force has maintained its position hitherto mainly by bluff, and in onr opinion any half-measure such as you suggest would merely serve to invite attack and would greatly increase difficulty of with- •dra will in face of opposition. We consider latter operation would be more damaging to our prestige than voluntary withdrawal now. 2. In para. 11 of your telegram you suggest that force might still play its role if it were again reduced to size prior to recent reinforcements or even below. We need not emphasise the tact that role which force can plav is almost entirely contingent on action taken by enemy, but even it maintained at present strength it' cannot now fulfil role for which it was originally intended, namely, to prevent Bolshevik invasion of Ivliorasan. Most it can hope to accomplish is to intercept small parties entering Khorasan from north-east and to counteract effects of enemy propaganda within limited radius of Meshed. \V r e c insider this could lie accomplished with equal effect and less obtrusively after reduction •of force to small mobile escort in support of Mission. In these circumstances retention of force at •extremely exposed line of communication which, though unable to maintain itself against serious attack, is still accompanied (? very often) by the impediments inseparable from body of troops of any size, is clearly open to criticism. 4. Xor is it certain that reduction in size of the force and line of communication troops would effect anv material reduction in cost. Chief item in present heavy expenditure is cost of hired camel transport •on difficult trap of 172 miles between the Duzdap Toi and Neh, and charges are likely to rise in the future owing to the gradual exhaustion of the sources of camel supply. In any case reduction of the forces at Meshed would not permit of any reduction of line of communication troops. 4. As regards the extent to which we are prepared to share cost of the force maintained in Fast Persia, you are aware of our present linancial situation, inability to provide (? needful) fund for military •expenditure and the various demands being made on us. In these circumstances we are not prepared to -contribute for the purpose named in your telegram more than a moiety of the cost of the escorts and detachments mentioned in our Foreign Department telegram No. 204 S. of 21st February. o We believe that Bolsheviks are genuinely alarmed (as recently reported by Malleson) at rumours of our intention to invade Trans-Caspia and iai.se Mussulman against them, and that their alarm is not simulated to furnish protest for aggression on their part. It should he realised that in such a populated eountrv like Fast Persia movement of quite small bodies of troops, accompanied by large quantity of transport, gives rise to most exaggerated rumours. We have some 40,000 camels moving to stud fro, on lines of communication, and we have (? further information) that Bolsheviks have received from their sides &lt;n-osslv exaggerated estimates of our strength. Our reinforcements have certainly added to these estimates, and similar exaggeration of Bolshevik forces is doubtless employed by our own informers. W T e believe it is to this cause that Bolshevik activity on Khorasau border is mainly due. and if so, we were to inform them clearly that we have no aggressive intention and simultaneously to withdraw bulk of our force, we believe danger to Northern Persia would be reduced to that arising from Bolshevik propaganda and not from military attack. As already stated, we believe that Consular escort at Meshed, too-cther with the local levies, would be sufficient to cope with this aggression. It is true that Persia mhrht recard withdrawal as sign of Inn* abandonment to Bolsheviks, but if it had result which we anticipate making Bolsheviks desist warlike preparation on her frontier, this effect would be only transitory. t&gt; We would again point out if it is seriously contemplated that force of size approaching present is Xo be maintained in Khorasan prolongation of railway to Neh would effect grea4 saving. Cost of camels.W' 30 ^ • \ \ maintained over this portion has already since armistice equalled estimated capital cost of this extension and conditions which are fatal to camels are rapidly depleting; whole of camel stock of (r* Western) India, reacting upon our frontier requirements and constantly forcing up hire charges in Eastern Persia, so that maintenance of force there is continually becoming more expensive and may shortly prove absolutely prohibitive. 31. —Telegram fm'm Secretan/ of State for India to Viceroy, Army department, dated oth May l!f20. 1651.
