Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with your Memorandum No,1874, dated, the 26th March 1914, I have the honour to forward herewith, for ratification, 4 copies of each of the agreements signed by the Alj^gA, Kaushabi and Tr the Kotaibi Chiefs, and to request that two ratified copies of each may be returned to me for delivery to the Chiefs concerned and for this office^ record. The place in Article IV of the Alawi agreement where he is to erect a post ought to be Al-Jomala and not Mabaja which has how been altered* 2. The unusually long delay which has taken place in the execution of these agreements was due to the dilatoriness of the Chiefs in coning to Aden, especially the Kotaibi who held, back until June last, while the Alawi and the Haushabi c|rae in and signed their agreements in July and September of last year, respectively. The Kotaibi put off his coming under one and another pretext but repeatedly asked for the payment of his stipend from the date of his signing the original agreement at Lshej on lith June 1913 - vide paragraph 8 of Colonel Jacob’s letter No*0^241, dated 28th June 1913, He was invariably replied that he would get no stipend unless and until he had signed the agreement approved by Government. He came in al7 last in June 1915$nd. signed the agreement. 3 ■ A11 3 Gllie;f s have been paid their stipends at the rate allowed in the present agreements with effect from the 29th November 1.9.1^, and not from the date of signing the agreements, in the following circumstances, 4. It will he seen from paragraph 9 of Colonel Jacob’s letter ho.0-241, dated 28th June 1913, referred to above that the agreement at Lahej was signed by the Alawi and the Koteibl Sheikhs subject to the grant to them by us of stipend, and arms and ammunition and that in paragraph 9 of the same letter, it was recommended that if the arrange ment had met with the approval of Government* the Chiefs might be given each a stipend of Hs-100 with 25 arms, Martini Henry, and 2500 rounds of ammunition. But this agreement was not approved by Government and fresh agree ments were accordingly prepared. The Chiefs, however, urged that they should receive their stipends from the date of that agreement, and it was therefore the intention of this Residency when submitting the latter agreements to Government for ratification, to invite a reconsideration of the point. It however came to our notice in July 1914 that the Haushabi and the Alawi Chiefs hsd, already been drawing enhanced stipends and on inquiry from the Treasury Officer it was found that these were being paid at the instance of the Accountant General, Bombay, who authorised the payment with effect from the 29th November 1913 under revised Pension Payment Orders issued in February 1914. I am not aware of the reason for paying these stipends from the 29th November 1913 nor does the Treasury Officer here know* but for the reasons stated above I would request that the formal sanction of the Government of India be nowobtained to the payment of the stipends to the Alawi end KotaiM from the 29th November 1913.

This agreement is provisional. 2. When the Secretary of State for India ordered the withdrawal of troops and Political Agent, Dthala, from the Hinterland, the following proposals were made by this office and approved* by the Government of India and the Secretary of despatch No. 20-Secret, dated uth June 1907. State tor the purpose ot ensuring the safety of the Aden-Dthala road :— (1) To grant a stipend of Rs. 50 to the Kotaibi Sheikh through the Amir of Dthala and to give him a present of 50 rifles and 5,000 rounds of ammunition. In return for this concession the tribe to be held responsible for the safety of the Habilen portion of the Aden-Dthala road. (2) To raise the stipend of the Alawi Sheikh from Rs. 50 to 100, to give h im pecuniary assistance to the extent of Rs. 500j* and to make him responsible for the safety of f Alawi received this amount in 1907. t p e portion of the eastern trade route lying between Jimil and A1 Hajar, to dismantle the Alawi post at Dar-al-Qabtan and to move it to Mabaja, the British post of Suleik being destroyed simultaneously to prevent its falling into the Kotaibi’s hands. (3) To increase the Haushabi Sultan’s stipend of Rs. 272 by Rs. 50, to give him 50 M. H. rifles and 5,000 rounds of ammunition and to make him responsible through the Abdali Sultan for the safety of the portion of the road from Nobat Dakim up to Jimil and also the Mavia caravan road. The increased stipend to be paid through the Abdali in the same way as the original stipend. C278FDjrcrffi ~st s ?.«' £: cient for the purpose. warded to the Government of India with modification of these agreements and the Secretary of State m his telegram the 3rd September ordered a further modification. 4 As reported to Government in this office telegram dated the 4th October 1907 and S No. C-19, dated the 11th idem, the d^fand Kotatbi Dthala before being able to sign the proposed agreements ^ alted Sheikhs soon commenced hostihties and the Resident m kis letter No. 0 156, dated 29th November 1907, explained the pohtical situation as follows. “The Abdali responsibilities extend to and include Nobat Dakim and above that Haushabi responsibihties extend to Jimil. Above Jimil Alawi responsibilities commence and extend to the site of the r - centiy demolished fort of Dar-al-Qabtan. Beyond that it is not posible at present precisely to apportion responsibility between the Alawi and Amiri tribes including the Kotaibi; and it is not possible to foresee the course of events upon the conclusion of the existing truce between the Alawi and Kotaibi tribes. : m „ 0 u; n te cause of these hostilities was due to the Alawi Sheikh sen- 5.

General DeBrath, in a long plated before were consi ere no C 1 better reviewing the situation, proposed * No. 110-C., dated 29th February 1908. £resh arrangements to meet the altered situation. The following extracts give the drift of these proposals “ The question now arises what that future settlement is to be.^ The Ko taibi is in possession, and having lost two of his own sons m the fight is implacable and claims to retain the Alawi territory that he has conquered. As I presume Government are not prepaced to turn him out, should he maintain this attitude, it seems to me that not only the easiest but the safest course is to recognise the &lt;fe facto possessor who has shown himself strong enough to hold his own The Amir who has helped the Kotaibi and who hopes to benefit bv his success supports him. The Kotaibi who was, perhaps not altogether justifiably, prevented from levying transit dues so long as we were in the Hinterland, has now re-imposed them, and claims the right to do so like all the rest. The Abdali Sultan admits the force of the Kotaibi logic, but for some reason that I have not so far grasped looks to a time when a part of at least of his lost territory shall be restored to the Alawi. As tbe result of the Alawi debacle, tbe Abdak, the Armn, the Kotaiffi and Alawi Sheikhs have all appealed to me to effect a settlement between them, lhave accordingly summoned them bef ore me and explained to them that it is they and not we who are con cerned because the stoppage of trade, which must infallibly resul from insecurity on the road and the imposition of unauthorised dues, will be directly reflected by diminished receipts from transit dues. Za that so long as each continues to disavow his responsibility for the act of his own tribesmen, unless they be committed in his own C-itorv so long will a premium be placed on disorder I pointed nut that so long a S s the Alawi and Kotaibi both had armed posts upon the road! there would always be trouble. This they do not deny..I added that the Alawi had shown himself impotent to maintain himself and entirely untrustworthy and I expressed my unwilling ness to assent to the imposition of any additional road dues which are in my opinion already too heavy. Beyond this I only urged co-operation among themselves whereby each party should engage to be responsible for the acts of his tribesmen wherever committed, I further urged that they should agree to the prompt payment of compensation by the Chief within whose limits an offence was coni’ mitted, and that they should bind themselves jointly to enforce recovery from the Chief of the tribe to which the offender belonged should the former show himself backward in paying up. I added that I felt sure that Government would agree to any reasonable decision that they might jointly arrive at so long as it made for peace and permanency. At their request I embodied in a draft the pro vision of a joint Agreement that seems to me to offer some real chance of success if it only be acted upon in good faith. This they have discussed among themselves and have professed thek readiness to conclude. By their desire I have agreed on their executing such an Agreement, to witness it and I have expressed my readiness to recommend to Government “ (i) that the transit dues heretofore levied by the Alawi shall in future pass to the Kotaibi Sheikh ; l “ (ii) that the additional stipend recommended in my No, 3419, dated the 9th June 1906, for the Alawi as representing the responsi bility formerly imposed upon him by the safeguarding of the road of which he will in future be relieved, should pass to the Kotaibi in consideration of his increased responsibilities; “ (Hi) that the Alawi’s present stipend should be continued to him in consideration of the original Resolution of Government in the Political Department No. 3512, dated the 20th May 1875, under which it was granted; “ (iv) that the arms recommended for the Kotaibi in my No, 592, dated the 27th January, 1907, should be given to him.” 6. The Government of India in their letter No. 2403-E.B., dated the 10th V'/de also Bombay Government letter No. 180- July 1908, approved of these proposals P., dated the 2nd October 1908. subject to the modification that the question regarding the levy by the Kotaibi Sheikh of. the transit dues formerly levied by the Alawi Sheikh should be left to the Chiefs concerned. 7. General DeBrath’s joint agreement proved unacceptable to the Chiefs o and, as explained in this office letters quoted I 908 tter N °* C 384&gt; dated th6 9th September in the margin, signature to it was delayed Letter No. C-497, dated the 2ist November from time to time. The Government of 1908. India thereupon in their letter No. 1812- Letter No. C-305, dated the 23rd July 19H. dated the 29th September 1911 ordered the return into store of the 100 M. H. rifles and 10,000 rounds of ammuni tion sanctioned for presentation for the Haushabi and Kotaibi Chiefs. 8. The only alternative left was therefore a reversion, in a somewhat modi fied form, to the arrangements originally suggested. Proposals for an agreement with the Haushabi Sultan have been submitted to Government in this office No. C-193, dated the 14th May 1913. His Highness the Abdali Sultan has induced the Alawi and Kotaibi Sheikhs to sign in his presence the following agreement subject to the grant to them by us of stipend, arms and ammunition. “1. I Sheikh Ali Nasher, the Alawi, do hereby undertake not to levy transit dues more than 12 annas per camel load and to receive them at Lahej ; I am not entitled to impose them at any other place. “ 2. I take upon myself to make good any property belonging to the tra vellers which may be taken away or destroyed by my tribesmen^ and to protect the territory extending from A1 Jum a to A1 Hajar.“3.

Moreover ere dit is due to His Highness for the part he has played in settling the long-stan mg feud between these tribes and bringing about this agreement for the safety of the trade routes which would have been impossible of accomplishment without h . Thet trite have now made up their difference and it is an auspicious moment in which to seal their friendship in the manner proposed. fDKAFT AGREEMENT WITH THE KOTAIBI SHEIKH.

Proposal to grant the HanshM and an increase of Us stipend to Hs. 4 UU per mensem. Note, dated the 14th May 1913, by Major H. F. Jacob, First Assistant Resident, Aden. I interviewed the Hanshabi Sultan Ali Mani lately in ^ capital of M-ermr and he again urged his claims to an enhanced strpend and a gift of arms and am munition. _ . n - It will be remembered that in 1907 it was proposed by this R^ency to give similar privileges. j v tt After the evacuation, the Kotaibi and Alawi met and fought and the Hau- shabi for some reason or kher, failed to come to Aden to discuss details. aecordance with Government of India orders conveyed under M^mor ncl 7ftQ7 rlatpil 13th October 1911, from the Bombay Government, Politrca p S, r'on ist July 1912 to the ArsenaGand there the matter was left I do not think we should group these peoples together any longer. Their in terests are separate. The Kotaibi and Alawi HaUabi TWs severable, as their habitats are on one terrain; but no * so f Alawi Sultan’s claims may be treated quite distinctly. It is said th have made some agreement with the Abdali Sultan ^“oon to an early date these once irreconcilable chieftains. 1 hey^ a , f Aden and a separate report will be made in due course, but I am n y P about them. As regards the Haushabi, his position on the frontier entitles him to specia^ consideration, more specially since the Imam and Turks have joined hands and the former is gradually displacing the latter in the Yemen and is moving down towards our lately delimited frontier, v It will be extremely politic favourably to consider his position and growing importance and to give him, without delay, what we formerly intended to gn e hi , but were hindered by his non-appearance in Aden. The Haushabi Sultan is the custodian of many and important trad^routes passing through his domain Aden-wards. He is a loyal Ruler and his tribesmen are amenable to him. I will enumerate these trade-routes which all carry merchandise to Aden. (1) From Nobat Dukaim to A1 Milah and A1 Ulub* (2) From K.arkahan to Nobat Dukaim (The Mavia route). (3) From Najd A1 Musammi to Nobat Dukaim (The Baidah route).. (4) From Harur to Lahej (The Yafa route). (5) From A1 Hisa to Musemir (The Amara route). (6) From Earn Darwish to Abdali territory (The Bamleh route). (7) From Musemir to Nakil Madragah (The Madragah route). The Haushabi’s role on the frontier is a very difficult one and it is good to bolster him up and enhance his importance both in the eyes of his own ri esmen an3 in the face of the Turkish Arabs and Imam’s people across his border. He is one that has the privilege of sending recommendatory letters for his tribesmen to Aden, the purport thereof being to secure them presents, but of this concession he very seldom avails himself. therefore, propose for the favourable consideration of the Resident that he advise Government to make the following grants to Sultan Ali Mani:— (а) A free grant of 100 Martini-Henry rifles and ammunition (future supplies being advanced on payment as required.) The Amir of Dthala has been given, since 1904, 200 Martini-Henry rifles and ammunition and his position on the frontier is no more important than is the Hau- shabi’s. I think the Amir has been the gainer because of our actual presence in his midst for many years, and the favours shown to him were partly the result of our desire to enhance his prestige on that border. I would not differentiate one iota between the relative importance of these two Rulers. (б) An increase to the Haushabi’s stipend to bring it up to Rs. 400 per men sem. This will give him equal importance with the Amir of Dthala. The Haushabi’s stipend at present is Rs. 272 per mensem. If these concessions are made, we shall have consolidated his position in this tract and these favours will serve as a palliative to the stigma that still attaches to our withdrawal in 1907. The Imam will soon be making a bid for the allegiance of many of our fron tier Chiefs. His declension from Turkish control is becoming apparent and free from Turkish supervision, and encouraged thereby to seek his own aggrandisement, it is good to ensure that he shall confront, on our side, the border Chiefs who are bound to us by ties forged by good-will and liberality. It is a common proverb in the Hinterland that the Arab’s mind accepts no more than his eyes can visualise —“A1 Arab aqlahu fi ainihi.” There is nothing which binds the Arab so securely as the opening of the purse strings. The whilom Governor-General of the Yemen at Sana’a, Izzat Pasha, failed by force of arms to subjugate the Imam’s Zeidi hordes, but when he began to copy our Aden policy and to distribute monetary doles, the whole country-side lay at his feet. The concession I have recommended are intrinsically insignificant, but their effect will be far-reaching. This is the psychological moment to set them in motion. No. C-193, dated Aden, the 14th May 1913. Endorsed by the Political Resident, Aden. Forwarded, with compliments, to the Secretary to Government, Political De partment, Bombay, with reference to the correspondence ending with Government Memorandum, No. 7897, dated the 13th October 1911. I concur in the above memo randum and would urge Government to treat this case separately and on its merits. The Haushabi Sultan holds an important place in our sphere and it is very neces sary, at this time, to raise his status. 3—45 DRAFT AGREEMENT WITH THE HAUSHABI SULTAN.

DeBrath, C.B., C.I.E., Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to correspondence ending with my telegram, dated the 4th instant, regarding the withdrawal of the Political Agent, D’thala, and his escort from the Hinterland, and the conclusion of certain agreements with the Chiefs of the Haushabi, Alawi, and Kotaibi tribes, I have the honour to forward, for the information of Government, copy of a memorandum, dated the 4th October 1907, in which Major Jacob reports the circumstances under which the evacuation of the Hinterland has been now accomplished, and the forts at Suleik and Dar-al-Kabtan demolished. 2. I withhold comment on the situation to which the Alawi Sheikh’s change of attitude has given rise pending the result of further negotiations for the signing of the three agreements at Aden upon which I am now engaged. I have summoned each of the Chiefs concerned to Aden for the signature of these agreements on or before the 15th instant, and still await replies to the letters addressed to them. 3. Meanwhile, and pending the issue of orders on this office letter No. 5281, dated 25th August 1907, Major Jacob remains at Sheikh Othman charged with the direct control of the affairs of the tribes which formerly lay withm his sphere of influence at D’thala, and with the completion of a history of the same upon which he has recently been engaged. Memorandum on the Evacuation of D’thala with special reference to the signing of the agreements. Pursuant to the Resident’s instructions, I arranged a conference at Lahej of the Amir of D’thala, the Kotaibi and Alawi Chiefs, with prominent Saiyids. The Sultan of Lahej was present. At this interview, the respective limits on the trade route for each Chief interested to safeguard were carefully settled by me and these Chiefs in combination. It was also arranged that, along with the demolition of Port* Suleik and Dar-al-Kabtan (Alawi), there would be a dismantling of the Hardaba Blockhouse (Amiri) and Dar Taiz (Kotaibi) which the Kotaibi Chief had recently built as an opposition fort to Dar-al-Kabtan. The gift to Ali Nashir, the Alawi Chief, of Rs. 300 from the Abdali Sultan had now finally eradicated all suspicion from the former’s mmd and documents were formally entered upon by him and the Kotaibi^ Chief with the Abdali Sultan in which their respective limits, as well as their consent to the demoli tion of their Dars, were duly entered. This was hereafter to be ratified by me on the conclusion of the agreement. 2753 r. D,SHMBBBBl r 2. Shortly afterwards, on ray arrival at Fort Saleik, there was a difference of opinion between the Alawi and Kotaibi as to the priority of the demolition of their respective forts, each insisting that the other’s building should be the first to go down. 3. On my way down from D’thala on evacuation, on the 28th September, I had Fort Suleik and the Hardaba Blockhouse dismantled by the 81st Pioneers while I persuaded the Kotaibi to pull down Dar Taiz, and sent up men of the 81st Pioneers with some Aden Troopers to ensure the work being done completely. This programme was acceptable to both parties. With the question of priority thus arranged, I ascended the hill on which Dar-al-Kabtan stands in company with the demolition party of the 81st Pioneers. 4. On the hill I met with considerable opposition. Sheikh Ali Nasir, the Alawi, refused to give me the necessary permission unless I paid the Rs. 500 into his hands. I reminded him that the receipt of the amount was contingent on his demolishing the Dar and building another elsewhere; that I had, however, come up the hill at his own special invitation to effect the demo lition ; that the “ priority objection ” had not been previously raised at Lahej, but the point had been ceded by the Kotaibi in the interest of peace and good will, and that this further objection now raised was not only ridiculous but obstructive and unfriendly. 5. At this juncture, the Alawi contingent on the hill, comprising over 50 or 60 armed men, and made up of Alawis, Dthambaris and Hajailis, began to show signs of hostility and to threaten severe measure if the demolition of the Dar were effected without the Alawi’s permission which was to be accorded only if the Rs. 500 were forthwith produced and paid in. A Dthambari with whom I expostulated drew a bead on me with his loaded carbine and had he not been seized by his people, the situation would have become distinctly awkward. 6. The Kotaibi, on the opposite hill at Dar Taiz, seeing the night coming on and Dar-al-Kabtan still standing, feared I had gone back on my word and sent me a message that, until I completed the demolition, our sepoys would remain in their hands as hostages. 7. Sheikh Ali Nashir now decamped in a rage, leaving 30 men on the hill and refusing me the necessary permission to demolish his Dar. I was therefore constrained to cede to the Sheikh’s request because— (1) I should have placed the Pioneer’s demolition party in an awkward predicament had the Dar been demolished forcibly, and because (2) The Kotaibi’s treatment of our hostages depended on the rasin° of the Alawi Dar. I could not, with Dar-al-Kabtan standing, leave the country which would then have become a veritable Pandemonium. It was now pitch-dark. I paid the Rs. 500 and blew up the Dar. I then proceeded to the Kotaibi Camp and released the detenus. F 8. The Kotaibi Chief promised to sign the agreement the following day at Al-Millah but, instead of coming, he wrote to say that the crowds of Kotaibis, who had now poured in, prevented his coming in just then. Were he to come without their permission, they would believe he had taken the monetary present himself for his’own use and they would at once create discord. That he must therefore perforce postpone a while his appearance. 9. There may he a momentary hitch in these proceedings owing to the proximity of Ramzan observances, but I feel sure that Mahomed Saleh has every inducement to come in and sign his agreement and that he will come. 10. I am not so sanguine of Sheikh Airs movement. He was entirely responsible for the contre temps on the hill and has broken the solemn TderW® given at the Lahej conference. ^ ° 11. The Haushabi Sultan should have signed his agreement at Nobat Dakim but wrote to say that some minor internal dissensions in his country would necessitate his deferring his arrival. I am inclined to believe that pre^.paratioM for the Ramzan have caused Ali Mani to stay away. He will doubtless come m ere long. * ^ Pmnl 2 * f a ^! partlCul 2 r l y indeb ted to Lieutenant Alexander of the 81st Jrioneers for the very efficient and personal assistance rendered by him in ffie demolition of all these buildings. * Aden ; The 4th October 1907.

Quin, Esq., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, rolitical Department, - To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 7554, dated the 18th October 1907, I am directed to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India a copy of a letter No. C.-156, dated the 29th November 1907, from the Political Resident, Aden, together with a copy of this Department letter No. 7699, dated the 25th October 1907, to which it is a reply, regardino’ the proposal to conclude agreements with the Chiefs of the Haushabi, Kotaibi” and Alawi tribes. 2. I am to state that any remarks which this Government may desire to make on these papers will be submitted to the Government of India hereafter. No. C.-156, dated Aden Residency, the 29th November 1907. from— Major-General E. DeBrath, C.B., CJ.E., Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to correspondence ending with your letter No. 7699, dated the 26th October 1907, regarding the evacuation of D’thala, I have the honour to state that I have requested the Abdali Sultan to furnish me with copies of the documents passed to him by the Alawi and Kotaibi Chiefs and referred to in paragraph 1 of Major Jacob’s memorandum, dated the 4th October 1907, and that I hope that now that he has returned from his recent visit to Mokalla he will be able to furnish me with them at an early date. Before he left for Mokalla he stated that he had mislaid the documents, but would search for them on his return. 2. So far the Alawi Sheikh has evaded a similar request for a copy of the documents which he passed on the occasion under reference. And at present I see no reason to anticipate that he will comply with my request. 3. Meanwhile, as neither the Haushabi, Alawi, nor Kotaibi Chiefs evince any present desire or intention of responding to the invitation alluded to in the second paragrah of rpy letter No. C -19, dated the 11th October 1907, although the month of Ramazan has some time since expired, I consider it expedient no longer to withold comment on the present situation of affairs. 4. The general position on the Aden-D’thala road is now practically the same as it was before our occupation of D’thala. The forts which wer® constructed by our agency or at our instance have been destroyed, and the only material alteration is the improvement of the Khareba pass, which I hope that the Amir of D’thala will maintain. 5. So far as the political situation is concerned it can only be definitely asserted that Abdali responsibilities extend to and include Nobat Dakim, and that above that Haushabi responsibilities extend to Jimil. Above Jimil Alawi responsibilities commer ce and extend to the site of the recently demo-i lished fort of Dar-al-Qabtan. Beyond that it is not possible at present pre cisely to apportion responsibility between the Alawi and the Amiri tribessgg/tfHBtassmmmmmummmmmuKamKm action is freely ascribed to Turkish influence, and we shall not recover our position so long as we never show ourselves in the Hinterland and refrain from punishing murder and highway robhery on the trade routes. Chiefs, and to restrict the generosity shown to them to such stipend as is due under existing treaties and not forfeited by any actual breach of agreement. 8. Major Jacob is of opinion that it is probable that fresh advances^ will shortly be made by the Kotaibi, in which case he considers that it will be advisable to insist upon Alawai consent to any agreement effected, in order to avoid unrest on the Habilen. And in regard to the Haushabi he observes that some body must be interested in keeping him aloof from an agreement which is obviously to his advantage. 9. He concurs that the best course to pursue at present is to ignore recent proposals for fresh agreements, and to leave it to the Chiefs concerned to make fresh advances as they desire hereafter. And pending further development this is the course which I would propose to follow. No. 7699, dated Bombay Castle, the 25th October 1907. From—H. O.

In continuation of my letter No. 8848, dated the 11th December 1907, I am directed to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter No. C.-171, dated the 3rd idem, and of its enclosures, from the Political Resident at Aden, forwarding translations of the documents passed to the Haushabi Sultan by the Alawi and Kotaibi Chiefs. In continuation of my letter No. C.-156, dated the 29th November 1907, I now have the honour to forward copies of the documents alluded to in the first paragraph thereof which have just been furnished to me by the Abdali Sultan.2. It will bo observed that these are silent upon the'points actually lf ^ lone d ! a P i ar ‘g l 'apb 1 of Major .laoob’s memoramlum, dated 4th October 1J0/, and simply consist of admission that neither the Kotaibi nor the Alawi tribes are entitled to construct forts at A1 Hamra or at A1 Taiz. Beyond this it is only stated that existing administrative rights are not affected bv the agreements. ^ 3. Major Jacob states that he believes these to have been the only docu ments passed on the occasion, and observes that though they contain no specific mention of the actual demolition of the Dar (A1 Kabtan) at A1 Hamra and the Kotaibi Dar Al Paiz, such destruction was evidently contemplated and actually agreed to verbally in his presence. 4. He adds that though the documents contain on specific mention of the limits of responsibility on the Aden-D’thala road which were agreed upon, it was nevertheless decided at the Conference, and is implied by the docu ments, that tho^e met at Al Hamra, where neither tribe is entitled to build a fortlet. 5. Lastly, he observes that though the documents are also silent as to the adjudication of con dieting rights in this vicinity which was thereafter to be effected by the Abdali Sultan, such a settlement is really essential to the future peace of the District. 6. At present I contemplate no further action bevond that already indicated in my letter No. C-156, dated 29th November 1907. Praise be to God alone. This hon’ble bond is passed by Sheikh Ali Nashir, the Alawi, on behalf of himself and all the Alawi tribe in favour of Sheikh Mahomed Saleh Al Akhram, the Kotaibi, and the whole of the Kotaibi, to the effect that the A hi Ali (Alawis) have no right to construct a ‘car’ (house) at Al Hamra neither in time of war nor peace.

The immediate cause of these hostilities is reported to have been the Alawi Sheikh’s endeavour to re-erect a dar in the vicinity of the recently demolished Dar-al-Quabtan, and the present result is that Sheikh Ali Nashir has been worsted and is now a refugee at Lahej. He has further made certainovertures to me in regard to which I have informed him that some expression of regret for his past breach of faith and misconduct is an essential preliminary to their acceptance. 3. I have requested the Abdali Sultan, who is now on a visit to Aden, to give me further particulars of the affair.

With reference to correspondence ending with your Secret endorsement No. 1122, dated 14th February 1908, regarding tribal affairs on the Aden- D’thala road, I have the honour to submit the following report on the present condition of affairs ou that road for the information and the orders of Government. 2. It will he remembered that prior to the recent withdrawal from D’thala and other posts on the road, it was recommended that agreements should be entered into with certain of the Chiefs which should afford some real guarantee of security to the trade that follows that route. With that object certain draft agreements were drawn up and proposals were submitted to render some assistance to the Notaibi* Haushabi, and Alawi Chiefs, who, it was considered, were not in a position satisfactorily to fulfil their obligations without it. Existing agreements with the Abdali Sultan and the Amir of D thala were deemed sufficient so far as they were concerned. 3. At the same time it was recognised that onr withdrawal was likely to entail a recrudescence of hostilities between the Kotaibi and the Alawi tribe, who had for years past been at feud with one another and only temporarily and partially restrained during our occupation of certain posts in the Hinterland. A nd in order as far as possible tt) avoid this contingency, it was arranged that certain posts on the road, which were built upon debatable territory, such as the Dar-al-Qabtan and the Dar-al-Taiz, should be destroyed. To this course both the Chiefs concerned agreed at a meeting convened by the Abdali Sultan atLahej, in September last. And the Political Agent, D thala, was a witness to the agreement. 4. Further it will be remembered that upon^ our withdrawal from the Suleik fort and at the last moment when the Kotaibi was actually completing his part of this agreement, the Alawi Sheikh went back on his word, behaved with the greatest insolence and loss of self-control and v.gorously opposed the demolition of the Dar-al-Qabtan. In the end Major Jacob narrowly escaped being shot by one of the Alawi’s supporters, but the Dar was demolished and the withdrawal completed without further incident. ^ ^ _ 5 The hurried manner of our withdrawal however had the effect of giving all the Chiefs concerned, except the Abdali Sultan, an exaggerated idea of theirown importance ar d a false impression of our attitude. And in consequence the proposed agreements remained unsigned. 6. The situation has now so far changed that the agreements then con templated are not entirely suitable. Hardly had the Alawi and Kotaibi dars been blown up then the Alwai Sheikh, notwithstanding the fact that he had actually received certain pecuniary assistance previously s ipulated to enable him to rebuild his dar in territory that was not debatable, re-occupied the site of the Dar-al-Qabtan as well as that of the Dar-al-Taiz, which had been origin ally constructed and subsequently demolished by the Kotaibi tribe. This and other acts of hostility naturally brought about retaliation by the Kotaibi, who had hitherto behaved with singular forbearance and good faith. Having assembled the Radfan tribes and received help from the Amir whose suzerainty he acknowledges when convenient, the Kotaibi fell upon and defeated the Alawi, and dispossessed him of his territory. The Alawi fled and his country is still occupied by a mixed force of Abdali, Amiri, and Kotaibi, apparently with the object of maintaining the status quo pending some sort of permanent settlement. 7. The question now arises what that future settlement is to be ? The Kotaibi is in possession, and having lost two of his own sons in the fight is implacable and claims to retain the Alawi territory that he has conquered. As I presume Government are not prepared to turn him out, should he maintain this attitude, it seems to me that not only the easiest, but the safest course is to recognize the de facto possessor who has shown himself strong enough to hold his own. The Amir who has helped the Kotaibi and who hopes to benefit by his success supports him. The Kotaibi, who was perhaps not altogether justifiably prevented from levying transit dues so long as we were in the Hinterland, has now re-imposed them, and claims the right to do so like all the rest. The Abdali Sultan admits the force of the Kotaibi logic, but for some reason that I have not so far grasped, looks to a time when a part at ‘ least of his lost territory shall be restored to the Alawi. 8. Now it is admitted on all hands that the measures that have been- taken in the past have failed to secure the peace and safety of the road, and that trade has suffered in consequence. Transit dues in excess of those agreed to and sanctioned in 18S8 have undoubtedly been levied from time to time illegally, though it is a matter of no small difficulty to ascertain the actual amounts that are so levied, as the dues are collected in many places and no one Chief knows how much is leived by each of the others. Pillage and murder have increased and compensation for injury is hard for traders to come bv. This is more especially the case when the offence has been committed by *a tribesman in the territory of another Chief, as each seeks to evade his respon sibility for the. acts of his tribesmen when committed beyond the limits of his own country. No arrangement which fails to settle this question of compensa tion can ever prove satisfactory for long. 9. I understand the policy of His Majesty’s Government to be, that having laid down in the interests or trade what transit dues may be levied and havin 0, given to each Chief concerned a stipend and assistance in arms commensurate with the responsibilities imposed upon him by the care of the section of the road committed to his charge, we should then abstain from interference as far as possible and allow ihe Chiefs concerned to settle among themselves all ques tions of compensation. It must, however, not be overlooked that the sufferers will sometimes be British and sometimes Turkish subjects, and that in all cases not only will the parties who suffer appeal to the British Government for protection, but each Chief in turn will do the same and look to us to hold the scales evenly betweem them. These appeals we cannot afford to ignore with out loss of prestige. 10. As the result of the Alawi debacle, the Abdali, the Amiri, the Kotaibi and Alawi Sheikhs have all appealed to me to effect a settlement between them. I have accordingly summoned them before me and explained to them that it is they and not we who are primarily concerned because the stoppage of trade, which must infallibly result from insecurity on the road and theimposition of unauthorised dues, will be directly reflected by diminished receipts from transit dues: and that so long as each continues to disavow his responsibility for the acts of his own tribesmen unless they be committed in his own territory, so long will a premium he placed on disorder* I pointed out that so long as the Alawi and Kotaibi both had armed posts upon the road there would always be trouble. This they do not deny. I added that the Alawi had shown himself impotent to maintain himself and entirely untrust worthy and I expressed my unwillingness to assent to the imposition of any additional road dues which are in my opinion already too heavy. Beyond this I only urged co-operation among themselves whereby each party should ensage to he responsible for the acts of his tribesmen wherever committed. I futher urged that they should agree to the prompt payment of compensation by the Chief within whose limits an offence was committed, and that they should bind themselves jointly to enforce recovery from the Chief of the tribe to which the offender belonged should the former show himself backward in paying up. I added that I felt sure that Government would agree to any reasonable decision that they might jointly arrive at so long as it made for peace and permanency. At their request I embodied in a draft the provisions of a joint agreement (see A attached) that seems to me to offer some real chance of success if it only be acted upon in good faith. This they have discussed among themselves and have professed their readiness to conclude. By their desire I have agreed, on their executing such an agreement, to witness it and I have expressed my readiness to recommend to Government— (i) that the transit dues heretofore levied by the Alawi shall in future pass to the Kotaibi Sheikh; (ii) that the additional stipend recommended in my No. 3419, dated 9th June 1906, for the Alawi as representing the respon sibility formerly imposed upon him by the safeguarding of the road of which he will in future be relieved, should pass to the Kotaibi in consideration of his increased responsibilities; (Hi) that the Alawi’s present stipend should be continued to him in consideration of the original Besolutiou of Government in the Political Department, No. 814, dated 14th May 1875, under which it was granted ; (iv) that the arms recommended for the Kotaibi in my No. 592, dated 27th January 1907, should he given to him. 11 The matter is still under the consideration of the Chiefs concerned and I hope I may be able to bring them to some sort of agreement. But they are as short-sighted as children, each filled with a profound distrust ot one another and only unanimous in their determination to obtain some increase to tlieir allowances, even though ttiey may have nothing to ofler in return. In orde hat I may be in a position io carry out the wishes of Government I reouest to be informed at an early date how far a settlement on the lines 1 have indicated will meet with their approval and how far the conclusion of su settlement will be left to me.

The position at present is briefly as follows The Alawi Chief has been re-instated in his territory but transit dues are being collected and kept on his behalf at lahe i . Through the inter-mediation of the Sultan of Xahej a truce for one year has been arranged between the Eotaibi and the Alawi, during which time it is said that seme permareno arrangement may be arrived at. he Fctaibi Sheikh is exacting unauthorised dues cn the Habilen,Eabilen tc the detriment of trcde, but no complaints have as yet reaehe d me . The Amir of Dthala is collecting dues largely in excess cf those authorised by treaty, at Lahej and Tafwa on exports and imports respectively. The Haushabi's and Abdali’s dues are collected at lahej. 3. As regards paragraph 2 cf the letter under reference, from the Government of India, I would point cut that the de molition cf the Eotaibi and Alawi dars was made a necessary precedent to the granting of any assistance to either of these Chiefs. These dars have again been rebuilt without permission and will prove a constant menace tc the peace of the trade route. In the circumstances it would appear obvious that it would be undesirable to grant any stipend or other conces sion tc the Zotaibi Chief until the agreement is concluded, as, by so granting, we would lose one of cur most potent arguments in inducing him to sign the agreement. 4. In conclusion, I would invite a reference to paragraph 11 of my C-HO, dated 29th February 1908. I have not been favoured with any orders or indication of Government’s wishes j in the matter, and I regard this as necessary before I am in a position to submit any final proposals or indeed press upon the Chiefs concerned the conclusion of the agreement suggested.[ Secret. ] No. 1718, dated Bombay Castle, the 9th March 1908.

With reference to correspondence ending with your Secret endorsement No. 1122, dated 14th February 1908, regarding tribal affairs on the Aden- D’thala road, I have the honour to submit the fo lowing report on the present condition of affairs on that road for the information and the orders of Government. 2. It will be remembered that prior to the recent withdrawal from D’thala and other posts on the road, it was recommended that agreements should be entered into with certain of the Chiefs which should afford some real guarantee of security to the trade that follows that route. With that object certain draft agreements were drawn up and proposals were submitted to render some further assistance to the Kotaibi, Haushabi, and Alawi Chiefs, who, it was considered, were not in a position satisfactorily to fulfil their obligations without it. Existing agreements with the Abdali Sultan and the Amir of D’thala were deemed sufficient so far as they were concerned. 3. At the same time it was recognised that our withdrawal was likely to entail a recrudescence of hostilities between the Kotaibi and the Alawi tribe, who bad for years past been at feud with one another and only temporarily and partially restrained during our occupation of certain posts in the Hinterland. And in order as far as possible to avoid this contingency, it was arranged that certain posts on the road, which were built upon debateable territory, such as the Dar-al-Qabtan and the Dar-al-Taiz, should be destroyed. To this course both the Chiefs concerned agreed at a meeting conveued by the Abdali Sultan at Lahej, in September last. And the Political Agent, D’thala, wq^ a witness to the agreement. 4. Further, it will be remembered that upon our withdrawal from the Suleik fort and at the last moment when the Kotaibi was actually completing his part of this agreement, the Alawi Sheikh went back on his word, be h a yf d with the greatest insolence and loss of self-control, and vigorously opposed the demolition of the Dar-al-Qabtan. In the end Major Jacob narrowly escaped being shot by one of the Alawi’s supporters, but the Dar was demolished and the withdrawal completed without further incident. 5. The hurried manner of our withdrawal however had the effect of giving all the Chiefs concerned, except the Abdali Sultan, an y^oJ erat ® d 1 . a of their own importance and a false impression ^ of our attitude. And in consequence the proposed agreements remained unsigned. 6. The situation has now so far changed that the agreements then contem- plated are not entirely suitable.

The question now arises what that future settlement « to be? The Rotaibi is in possession, and having lost two of is own f° ns conquered implacable and claims to retain the Alawi territory that he ^s conquered. As I presume Government are not prepared to turn him out, should he ma n tain this attitude, it seems to me that not only the easiest, but the safest course is to recognise the de facto possessor who has shown himself strong enoug i hold his own. The Amir who has helped the Kotaibi and who hopes to benefit by his success supports him. The Kotaibi who was perhaps not altogether justifiably prevented from levying transit dues so long as we were m the Hinterland, has now re-imposed them, and claims the right to do so like all the rest. The Abdali Sultan admits the force of the Hotaibi logic, but for some reason that I have not so far grasped, looks to a time when a part at least of his lost territory shall be restored to the Alawi. 8. Now it is admitted on all hands that the measures that have been taken in the past have failed to secure the peace and safety of the road, and that trade has suffered in consequence. Transit dues in excess of those agreed to and sanctioned in 1888 have undoubtedly been levied from time to time illegally, though it is a matter of no small difficulty to ascertain the actual amounts that are so levied, as the dues are collected in many places and no one Chief knows how much is levied by each of the others.

This is more especially the case when the offence has been commit tied by a tribesman in the territory of another Chief, as each seeks to evade his responsi bility for the acts of his tribesmen when committed beyond the limits of his own country. No arrangement which fails to settle this question of compen sation can ever prove satisfactory for long. 9. I understand the policy of His Majesty’s Government to be, that having laid down in the interests of trade what transit dues may he levied and having given to each Chief concerned a stipend and assistance in arms com mensurate with the responsibilities imposed upon him by the care of the section of the road committed to his charge, we should then abstain from interference as far as possible and allow the Chiefs concerned to settle among themselves all questions of compensation. It must, however, not be over looked that the sufferers will sometimes be British and sometimes Turkish subjects, and that in all cases not only will the parties who suffer appeal to the British Government for protection, but each Chief in turn will do the same and look to us to hold the scales evenly between them. These appeals we can not afford to ignore without loss of prestige. 10.

By their desire I have agreed, on their executing such an agreement, to witness it and I have expressed my readiness to recommend to Government— (i) that the transit dues heretofore levied by the Alawi shall in future pass to the Kotaibi Sheikh ; (h) that the additional stipend recommended in my No. 34*19, dated 9th June 1906, for the Alawi as representing the responsibility formerly imposed upon him by the safeguarding of the road of which he will in future he relieved, should pass to the Kotaibi in consideration of his increased responsibilities; (Hi) that the Alawi’s present stipend should be continued to him in consideration of the original Resolution of Government in the Political Department, No. 814, dated 14th May 1875, under which it was granted; (iv) that the arms recommended for the Kotaibi in my No. 592, dated 27th January 1907, should be given to him. 11. The matter is still under the consideration of the Chiefs concerned and I hope I may be able to bring them to some sort of agreement. But they are as short-sighted as children, each filled with a profound distrust of one another, and only unanimous in their determination to obtain some increase to their allowances, even though they may have nothing to offer in return. In order that I may be in a position to carry out the wishes of Government I request to be informed at an early date how far a settlement on the lines I have indicated will meet with their approval and how far the conclusion of such a settlement will be left to me. A AGREEMENT. We, whose names are hereunto appended speaking for ourselves and for those tribes whose suzerainty we claim, for our mutual advantage, to foster trade, and to secure to us the benefits that we severally derive from the dues that we are permitted to levy by the British Government on caravans passing through our limits, hereby agree and mutually covenant as follows :— (i) We will protect from outrage and violence all travellers passing to and from Aden, and we will each of us be responsible to each other and to the British Government for the security of the road within our respective limits which are defined as follows : Amiri . • . . • Sana to Safa Hilia.

In reply, I am to say that the Government of India have some doubt as to the desirability of withholding the additional stipend proposed by the Resident at Aden for the Kotaibi Chief, since such action might render the acceptance of the proposed agreement by the Kotaibi Chief difficult to obtain.

Sir, In continuation of my letter Uo. 1718, dated the 9th March 1908, regarding tribal affaire on the Aden-Dthala road, I am directed to etate, for the information of the Government of India, that the Governor in Council concur* generally in the views expressed by Major General DeBrath in his letter No. C-110, dated the 29th February 1908. The proposed inter-tribal Agreement seems satisfactory and I am to observe that there is no objection to the Political Resident witnessing it as suggested. 2 . In regard to the four recommendations submitted by the Political Resident in paragraph 10 of his letter above referred to, i am to say that His Excellency in Council supports recommendations (iii), relating to the continuance of the stipend at present paid to the Alawi SheikhSheikh, and (iv), the presentation of 50 rifle, and 5,000 rounds of ^munition to the Kotaihi Sheikh. This presenta tion was to have been made on the occasion of the Sheikh sign, ing the Agreement proposed at the time of the evacuation of Dthala hut, owing to the negotiations falling through, tne Political Resident did not avail himself of the sanction communicated in Foreign Department endorsement No. 450(&gt;-E.B. , dated the 16th November 1907. 3. The question rregarding the levy by the Kotaibi levied Sheikh of the transit dues hitherto/by the Alawi Sheikh appears to is Excellency in Council to be a matter which should be left to the Chiefs concerned. As regards the Resident’s recommendation (ii), I am to state that His Excellency in Council does not consider that the additional stipend suggested therein should be given to the Kotaibi Sheikh, at least at present, and I am to suggest that this matter might await consideration pending the consolidation the Sheikh of his recently acquired position.

So far all are raore or less agreed that the Kotaibi should enjoy the fruits of his recent victory over the Alawi and that, what- ever restoration of territory may be hereafter arranged, the &gt; Alawi should not be re-admitted to a position of responsibility on the road and that his transit dues and additional stipend should therefore pass to the Kotaibi. At the same time they are agreed that to secure the better safety of the road in future some clear understanding is desirable as to their several and joint responsibilities. 3. No definite decision was arrived at last Tuesday. But I am hoping that satisfactory proposals may shortly be put forward by the Chiefs themselves upon the Abdali's advice, which will form the basis of more satisfactory and permanent arrangements than have hitherto existed for the peace of the Aden-D'thala road. 4.4.

An agreenent has now teen signed by the Chiefs concerned on the lines that I had suggested for the future safety of the Aden-D' thala road. But as it contained no mention of the important question of transit dues, I am arranging to have another interview with the Chiefs with a view to arrving, if possible, at some more satisfactory understanding in the matter. 14th March 1908. I have had a further interview with the Abdali Sultan and the other Chiefs concerned regarding the question of the Aden-D'thala road, the result of which is that the Chiefs have arranged to add to their agreement mentioned last week a clause fixing a single place for collection of all transit dues. As soon as this has actually been signed, and after receiving a reply from Government to my letter Bo.

It will be observed that these are silent upon the points actually mentioned in paragraph 1 of Major Jacob's memorandum dated 4th October 1907, and simply consist of admissions that neither the Kotaibi nor the Al&amp;wi tribes are entitled to construct forts at Al Hamra or at Al Taiz. Beyond this it is only stated that existing administrative rights are not affected by the Agreements. 3. Major Jacob states that he believes these to have been the only documents passed on the occasion, and observes that though they contain no specific mention of the actual demolition of the Par (al Kabtan) at Al Hamra and the Kotaibi dar at Al Taiz,1 ^ di' N1 SUCri iRSt,rilct:ioa was «vitenter contemplated and. actually agreed to verbally in his presence. a ^- s ^h&amp;t thou^i the documents contain no specific mention of the limits of responsibility on the Aden-Dthala road which were agreed upon, it was nevertheless decided at the conference! and is implied by the documents, that those met at A1 Harara where neither tribe is entitled to build a fcrtlet.

DeBrath, C.B., C.I.E., Political Resident, Aden; The Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay. Sir, With reference to correspondence ending with your letter Ho. 7699, dated 26th October 1907, regarding the evacuation of Dthala, I have the honour to state that I have requested the Abdali Sultan to furnish me with copies of the documents passed to him by the Alav/i and Kotaibi Chiefs and referred to in paragraph 1 of Major Jacob's t &gt; / memorandum dated 4th October 1907^ and that I hope that now that he has returned from his recent visit to Mokalla he will be able to furnish me with them at an early date. Before he left for Mokalla he stated that he had mislaid the documents but would search for them on his return. 2. So far the Alawi Sheikh has evaded a similar request for a c opy of the document which he passed on the occasion underunder reference. And at present I see no reason to anti cipate that he will comply with my request. Meanwhile as neither the Haushabi, Alawi, nor Kotaib Chiefs evince any present iesire or intention of responiins to the invitation alluded to in the second paragraph of my y lette r no. C-1S, dated 11th October 1907, although the month of Ramazan has some time since expired, I consider it ex pedient no longer to withhold comment on the present situa tion of affairs. 4. The general position on the Aden-Dthela road is nov/ practically the same as it was before our occupation of Dthala. The forts which were constructed by our agency or at our instance^ have been destroyed, and the only material alteration is the improvement of the Khareba pass which I hope that the Amir of Dthala will maintain. 5. So far as the political situation is concerned it can only be definitely asserted that Abdali responsibilities extend to and include Uobat Dakim, and that above that Hanshabi responsibilities exteni to Jimil. Above Jimil Alawi responsibilities commence and extend to the site of the recently demolished fort of Dar-al-Qabtan. Beyond that it is not possible at present precisely to apportion res ponsibility between the Alawi and the Amiri tribes including the Kotaibi; and it is not possible to foresee the course of eventsevents upon the conclusion of the existing truce between “tlie Al&amp;wi and 'tlie Kotiaibi 'tribes* 6 . At present neither tribe evinces very friendly in clinations; and the Amir of Dthala appears disposed to limit his own responsibilities to the utmost. There is little doubt that we have lost prestige in the Hinterland owing to the withdrawal of our garrison from Dthala and posts en route. Our action is freely ascribed to Turkish influence and we shall not recover our position so long as we never show ourselves in the Hinterland and refrain from punishing murder and highway robbeiy on the trade routes. 7. Pending further develox&gt;ment3 I would now propose, subject to the approval of Government, to assume an attitude of indifference in regard to the recently proposed agreements with the Haushabi, Alawi, and Kotaibi Chiefs, and to restrict the generosity shown to them to such stipend as is due under existing treaties and not forfeited by any actual breach of agreement. Q' Major Jacob is of opinion that it is probable that fresh advances will shortly be made by the Kotaioi, iu which case he considers that it will be advisable to insist upon Alawi consent to any agreement effected, in order to avoid unrest on the Habilen. And in regard to the Haushabi he observes that somebody must be interested in keeping him aloofaloof from an agreement which is obviously to his advantage 9. He concurs that the best course to pursue at present is to ignore recent proposals for fresh agreements, and to leave it to the Chiefs concerned to make fresh advances as they desire hereafter. And pending further development this is the course which I would propose to follow. I ha ve, e tc. , (SI.) E. DeBrath, Major-General, Political Resident, Aden.Secret. Uo. 7699.

With reference to correspondence ending with my telegram dated the 4th instant, regarding the withdrawal of the Political Agent, Dthala, and his escort from the Hinterland, and the conclusion of certain agreements with the Chiefs of the Haushabi, Alawi and Kotaibi tribes, I have the honour to forward, for the information of Government, copy of a memorandum, dated the 4th October 1907, in which Major Jacob reports the circumstances under which the evacu ation of the Hinterland has been now accomplished, and the forts at Suleik and Dar-al-Kabtan demolished. 2. I withhold comment on the situation to which the Alawi Sheikh’s change of attitude has given rise pending the result of further negotiations for the signing of the three agreements at Aden upon which I am now engaged. I have summoned each of the Chiefs concerned to Aden for the signature of these agreements on or before the 15th instant, and still await replies to the letters addressed to them. si 3. Meanwhile, and pending the issue of orders on this Office letter No. 5281, dated 25th August 1907, Major Jacob remains at Sheikh Othman charg ed with the direct control of the affairs of the tribes which formerly lay within his sphere of influence at Dthala, and with the completion of a history of the same upon which he has recently been engaged. Memorandum on the Evacuation of Ethcila icith special reference to the signing of the agreements. Pursuant to the Resident’s instructions, I arranged a conference at Lahej of the Amir of Dthala, the Kotaibi and Alawi Chiefs, with prominent Saiyids. The Sultan of Lahej was present. At this interview, the respective limits on the trade route, for each Chief interested to safeguard, were carefully settled by me and these Chiefs in combination. It was also arranged that, along with the demolition of Port Suleik and Dar-al-Kabtan (Alawi), there should be a dismantling of the Hardaba Blockhouse (Amiri and Dar laiz (Kotaibi) winch the Kotaibi Chief had recently built as an opposition fort to Dar-al-kabtan. The gift to Ali Nashir, the Alawi Chief, of Rs. 300 from the Abdali Sultan, had now finally eradicated all suspicion from the former s mind and documentsr\ l 1 3 Vn'm nrul the Kotaibi Chief with the Abdali were formally entered upon ^ h ” iL a s well as their consent to the demoli- Sultan in which their re *P® ctlve t ' , 1 ’ This was hereafter to he ratified by me tion of their Bars, were duly entered, uns on the conclusion of the agreement. ^ a diiIerellce 2.

Dthambanes and Hajailis, began to show sicns of hostility and to threaten severe measure if the demolition of the Bar were effected without the Alawi’s permission which was to be accorded only if the Rs 500 were forthwith produced and paid m. A Dthamban w whom I expostulated drew a bead on me with his loaded carbine and had he not been seized by his people, the situation would have become distin t y awkward. 6 The Kotaibi, on the opposite bill at Bar Taiz, seeing the night coining on and Dar-al-Kabtan still standing, feared I bad gone back on my word and sent me a message that until I completed the demolition, our sepoys would remain in their bands as hostages. 7. Sheikh Ali Nashir now decamped in a rage, leaving 30 men on the hill and refusing me the necessary permission to demolish his Bar. I was therefore constrained to cede to the Sheikh s request because ( 1 ) I should have placed the Pioneer’s demolition party in an awkward predicament had the Bar been demolished forcibly, and because (2) The Kotaibi’s treatment of our hostages depended on the rasing of the Alawi Bar. 1 could not, with Bar-al-Kabtan standing, leave the country which would then have become a veritable Pandemonium. It was now pitch-dark. I paid the Ks. 500 and blew up the Bar. I then proceeded to the Kotaibi camp and released the detenus. 8 . The Kotaibi Chief promised to sign the agreement the following day at Al-Millah but instead of coming, he wrote to say that the crowds of Kotaibis, who had now poured in, prevented his coming in just then. Were he to come without their permission, they would believe he had taken the monetary presents himself for his own use and they would at once create discord. That he must therefore perforce postpone a while his appearance. 9. There may be a momentary hitch in these proceedings owing to the proximity of Ramdthan observances, hut I feel sure that Mahomed Saleh has every inducement to come in and sign his agreement and that he will come. 210 I am not so sanguine of Sheikh Ali’s movement. He was entirely responsible for the oontre temps on the hill and has broken the solemn pledges given at the Labe] conference. r B ■^ aus ^ ia ^ J l Sultan should have signed his agreement at Nobat a im but wrote to say that some minor internal dissensions in his country would necessitate bis deferring his arrival. I am inclined to believe that pre parations for the Ramdthan have caused Ali Mani to stay away. He will doubtless come in ere long. 12. I am particularly indebted to Lieutenant Alexander of the 81st «xoneers for the very efficient and personal assistance rendered by him in the demolition of all these buildings.

As I have already reported, oy v;ire, the withdrawal from Dthala is now complete and the demolition of the various forts on the road which had to be destroyed has been carried out. Complications arose over the demolition of bar-a 1-Kabtan for which a change of mind on the part of the Alawi Cheikh at the last moment was responsible, with the result that Jacob could not in the short time at his il veek ending\ disposal get the Alawi and the Kctaibi agreements signed.

J have now summoned all three Chiefs to Aden for the signing of the agreements on or before the 15th instant.

With, reference to correspondence ending with Government of India’s tele- gram. No. S-313, dated the 27th June 1907, relative to the withdrawal of the oiitical Agent from D’thala, and in continuation of my letter No. 3802, dated the 22nd June 1907, I have the honour to recommend that early consideration may now be paid to the proposals referred to in the marginally noted communica tions regarding the organization of the Aden troop and the sphere of its opera- 2. As to the organization of the troop, an early change would seem parti* cularly desirable to facilitate the conduct of political affairs after the withdra wal from D’thala ; and it would at the same time appear desirable to take the W w iono ragrapl1 86 memor andum dated 22nd June IBOb, accompanying this office letter No 1150 dated 25th February 1906. 9th* J^ ^a ^906 , °* ce l e ^ er No. 3419, dated 19 o£ this office ^tter No 6267, dated 21st October 1906.'* ) (f) '* ) &lt; £ Q 9 W W Vi W tu.jm 8372PD 9 :J , . .

And I am of opinion that 1 Jemadar, 2 Havildars, * 21 Sowars, will, together with the six Arab guides and one interpreter still retained in the Iroop, introduce sufficient Arab element to meet immediate requirements and at the same time to afford an opportunity of testing the desirability of hereaftei introducing a still stronger Arab element in that force. 5. The result of past experience is that the Arab is of comparitively little fighting value, and it may even be considered doubtful whether the most care ful recuitment and training will ever render this portion of the force fit for any functions other than those for which they were originally entertained which were practically the s(j&gt;me as those undertaken by the Belooch Guides of the Sind Horse upon which the troop was originally modelled. ^ 6. At the same time a larger portion of such guides than at present exists is, in my opinion, desirable for political purposes. And there are various duties of a police^ nature in the more immediate vicinity of the British border for which I think that they are suitable and it may hereafter prove desirable to slightly increase their strength. 7. I naturally contemplate that, if the above recommendations are sanc tioned, the duty of patrolling the outskirts of Sheikh Othman and the neigh bouring British villages of Imad, Hiswa and Little Aden should again devolve upon the troop, and that body should again undertake the patrol duties, the pro tection of the frontier, and the pursuit of thieves and other offenders for which they were originally raised. I at the same time contemplate that the functions of the regular Sheikh Othman Police should he strictly limited to ordinary police duties within that village and on the road between it and the fortress only. The policing of the outlying villages of Imad. Hiswa and Little Aden should devolve upon the Aden troop only : and that body should he regarded as the ^Frontier Police “ as opposed to the Ordinary Police ” of the Settlement. 8. In fact the Aden troop should be primarily regarded as a special Fron tier Police, charged with the peace of the frontier and its immediate vicinity, and ready and competent to co-operate in case of emergency not only with the irregular forces of our immediate neighbours but with such regular troops as may be retained at Aden for frontier affairs. 9. As to the sphere of their operations, General DeBrath has already indi cated (vide his letter No. 457, dated the 1st January 1907) the necessity of a patrol to Khor Umeira, and the desirability of interposition to maintain order * Fermanen^ Temporary Special •with Major Jacob 4S372FD 3 on the main trade routes to the west of Aden {vide paragraphs 18 and 19 of his letter No. 6267, dated the 21st October 1906). And to this I have only to add that it would at the same time appeal desirable that an understanding should be arrived at with our m^re immediate and friendly neighbours, the Akrabi, Abdali and Fadthli Chiefs for the hot foot pursuit of criminals in co operation with the forces which they should be required to maintain for the same purpose near the British border. 10. It is in the Subehi District to the west of Aden that disorder has for long past been most frequent and most troublesome. And it is therefore more particularly in this direction that it is desirable to afford such scope to the Aden troop as may result in a greater security of life and property than the Abdali Sultan has ever yet proved capable of providing, or is ever likely to ensure without a more liberal co-operation than has hitherto been accorded to him.

I am at the same time to observe that the Aden troop appears to have absorbed the old Arab levies of a strength of 26, and to request that you will furnish a statement of the present and proposed composition of the force. 3.

No 4998, dated Aden, the 11th August 1907 (Secret). From—M ajor-General DeBrath, C.B, C.I,E., Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to|the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Confidential No. 145-P., dated 2nd August 1907, calling upon me to submit proposals to define the equivalent of the “ ten mile limit *’ which should form the ordinary sphere of activity of the proposed local corps referred to in paragraph 3 of Secretary of State’s despatch No. 20-Secret, dated 4th May 1906, and asking for a state ment of the present and proposed composition of the force. 2. I would first of all remark that I desire to modify to some extent the proposals contained in Lieutenant-Colonel Legh’s Secret letter No. 4074, dated 6th July 1907. I should therefore be glad if the present proposals are regard ed as superseding those contained in the letter here referred to. 3. In paragraphs 17,18, 26 of my letter No. 6267, dated 21st October 1906, I indicated in general terms the manner in which outrages on -^ ® i? ra „ routes should in my opinion he dealt with by the Abdali ayd Haus a i orce supported by the Aden troop. I will now proceed further to define t e ner in which this may he done. I would here observe that it ism m y °P 1 most desirable that the system I propose should he inaugurated concurr y with the withdrawal of the Political Agent from D’thala. It is not possi forecast the precise effect of this move, but I believe that any wea ® , our influence in the Hinterland will he minimised by the re en io Political Agent for a month or two at Nobat Dakim while things se » and his presence there will be very advantageous in watching an ire0 ^ ? t action of the Aden troop within the limits I propose. I shall re er g this matter in paragraph b below.S372ED 4 4. I propose that the Aden troop should act in support of the Abdali and Haushabi forces to police a belt of country 35 miles from Sheikh Othman. I fix that distance for two reasons. Eirstly, because I regard it as necessary that they should have posts at Nohat Dakim and Am Eiga which command the principal routes entering Abdali territory and, secondly, because 70 miles (to Sheikh Othman and back) is more than a tribesman can cover in one day, so that with good communications there is a chance of our cutting off a raider before he can get past our posts. At present this is quite impossible. 5. Assuming that the 35-mile radius from Sheikh Othman is agreed to, I desire to place detachments of the Aden troop at Nobat Dakim, Am Eiga and Bir Am Mukhnuk with a support at Lahej. I would arrange with the Sultan of Lahej that all these posts should be held by levies on whom we must greatly rely at first for intelligence and at all times for co-operation. It may hereafter prove advisable to have a post at Zanzibar in Eadthli territory, but 1 do not wish to establish it if it can be avoided. I could probably secure suitable accommo dation for the men without extra cost at Nobat and Lahej. I therefore do not desire to actually make over to the Abdali the buildings at Nobat till this mat ter is settled. At the other two posts some slight expense will probably be ne cessary. I will report on this separately when I have visited the post in ques tion. The strength of the several detachments should be left to me to fix with reference to training and duties at Khormaksar, but they should be no stronger than is absolutely necessary. The post should, if possible, be connected by visual signalling. The main duty of these detachments will be to organise a system of regular patrols by tribal levies of the trade routes within the 35-mile limit, so that prompt notice should be taken of any outrage occurring on the trade routes and the offenders arrested. They will not be allowed to operate beyond the 35-mile limit whether in Subaihi territory or elsewhere, but within that limit it is ab solutely necessary that I should be able to order them anywhere without refer ence. 6. To ensure succees it is necessary to enlist the sympathy and co-opera tion of the Chiefs concerned, and I thick they will readily agree to the course I propose. 7. I now turn to the future composition of the force. The detached duties I propose will be the reverse of popular in the Aden troop. I therefore consi der it highly inexpedient to attempt to do too much at once, and I trust that no alteration be made in the composition of the Aden troop, until they have se - tied down for some months at their new duties ^ and we can see how^ things work out. The Arab guide element consisting as it does of only 7 men is, how ever, too weak and I would therefore, for the present, attach to the troop e 4 extra sowars of the Sheikh Othman Mounted Police which now form part ot Political Agent, D’thala’s escort making no change whatever in their conditions of pay or service. Untill l have some experience to guide me in the wording of the system I propose, I do not feel prepared to lay down the ^ture stiengt or composition of the troop which, even with the aid of the Shei Police, will he none too strong for the work they will be called upon ^ • due course I will put forward proposals on this head, chief of whie the troop should he commanded by an officer who must a taste for political rather than strictly military duties. Until this « done, w cannot, I think, hope for any great measures of success. But for the p ^ I propose to utilise the services of the Political Agent, I) tha a, 1 mile limit to help and direct the activities of the troop. 8. In this connection I desire to refer to paragraph H/ Government of India despatch No. 74, dated 25th April 1907, and the F 01 ' 1 ^^ ®°1 a “e I paragraph 6 of Secretary of State’s Secret despach No. &gt; without pre- have no wish to depute the Political AgenUo the Turkish ™ territory, vious reference except in the case of Amin and possib y ^an In neither of these cases is there, in my OP 11 ^ 0 * 1 ' ^ ^ l l ea , , Nobat Dakim/ exists at,(present moment. And I think that during his s y , A^ent while watching the effect of our withdrawal from D thala, the Po o5 I 5 • I V d5' should certainly keep in touch with Amiri 'affairs and visit D’thala as often as ’ may he necessary and convenient. The occurrence of hostilities between the -/e. Turks and Imamis in the neighbourhood of Kataba furnishes an additional reason for the course I propose. If the Political Agent is called upon U visit /a Amin or Haushabi territory, I propose that he should be accompanied through- / out by a suitable escort of the Aden troop and by the Amir or Haushahi Snl tan or by some member of their families. n&gt; 9. It is understood that the measures I have proposed above are mainly directed against the Bedouin Subaihi who are responsible for the majority of the outrages that occur. I believe that it/be more effective and cheaper in the /s wool] end thoroughly to punish them for their past misdeeds, and if this were done the effective policing of the 35*mile limit would be a comparatively easy mat ter. But^if other considerations forbid the despatch of an expedition against the Subaihis, then we can still do a good deal with an active and mobile body of frontier mounted police organised as I have suggested.

Seoietaiv wO Govomment, 3 oml)fi^y •— TO rue Secretary to the Government o: ? India, Foreign Department. Sir, In continuation of my ho. 5955, dated the noth August 1907, with which was forwarded, for the information of the Government of India, a letter from the Political Resident, Aden, containing certain proposals relating to the determination of the limits of the area outside the territory of British India and within the Protectorate, which is referred to in paragraph 5 of the Secretary of State’s despatch ho. 20-Secret, dated the 4th May 1906, as the area within which internal disturbances would call for interposition, I am now to submit the following remarks. O # Pile main proposals put forward hy General Dehrath in his letter are (1) that the Aden Proop should ordinuril operate within the radius of '5 miles from Sheikh Otlman ; (2) that detachments of tills Proop should be placed at fa' hobat Dakim, (b) Amriga and fcl Dir An TIuklinuk ; f5) that the duties of the Pro op and of the detaclirients should bo to sup port the Abdali and Haushabi forces in policing the country.and to organise a systOu of regular patrols tri’oal levies of the trade routes within the 35 wile/ linit so that prompt notice should he taken of any outrage occurring on the trade routes and the offenders arrested. 3 * Tn regard ^o these proposals generally, I an to say that the Governor in Counoil is not able to give them his support. His dissent from the General DeHrath’s recommend ations is based not on the ground that they are inefficient for the purpose for which they are conceived, but on the fact that they run counter to the Secretary of States’ urgent wish that the Residency should cease to interfere in the affairs of the tribes in the Hinterland. Co the Governor in Council it seems that the proposal that the Aden Croop should have out posts at Amriga, ITobat Dakin and Dir Am Iluklmuk is indicative of a policy more forward than that which was proposed by the Government of Bombay in Iluroh 190G and which would seem to have aroused the apprehensions of the Secretary of State. Che Governor in Council, I am to say, is, accordingly, of opinion that the only policy left to the Residency is that the Sultan of Lahej must be held responsible for the safety of the routes passing through Ararigu and ITobat Dakin and Oj. cno comiwry outside the reach of ordinary daily patrolling oy the fro op from their Head Quarters in Drat ion tcrx'iiory • 4. I am to invite attention to Colonel Legh’s lette: Ho. 4074, dated the 5th fuly 1907, copy of which was forwardedI to the Government of India ulth letter Eo. U5- ? ., anted the 2nd August 1907, and to renark that the dutio s aaoignecl to the Aden Troop in paragraph 7 of that letter are those which, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, should ordinaril y 'oe undertaken ty the Aden Troop. These duties should he utilised as a means to keep the men fit fir special occasions while the effective execution of them would prevent outrages in British limits. Fithin these limits a system of oovering patrols could be instituted which would keep ou^ borders safe and serve / with the help of a little signalling^to give the troopers a good start in not pursuit of a fugitive raider* fixe Aden i Troop should supply the escort for any Political Officer who may be ordered on duty outside the British limits ; but the Governor in Council is distinctly of opinion that it should not be used as suggested by General DoBratJi for eo-operation with tribal operations of the Abdali or for any other operation connected with the tribes without the special orders of Government• 5. In paragraphs 3 and 8 of his letter General DePrath alludes to a proposal which has been made by him that Llajor Jacob, the present Political^ D’thala, should halt :*or a month or two at TTobat Dakin when on his way back to Aden after the evacuation of D T thala. This recommendation in its entirety is &lt; one which, T am to say, the Governor in Council is unable tosupport . It seens to him undesirable that Major Jacob should halt at ITobat Dakin any longer than nay be found necessary to complete the agreements, the execution of which has been approved by the Secretary of State, and to make such other ar rangements as may be essential. She precise object to be gain ed by retaining Major Jacob at Dobat Dakim for so long a period as two months is not clear and such a measure would, in the opinion of . the Government of Bombay, bo inconsist/.nt with the policy of non-interference which has been laid down by the Secretary of State, and in pursuance of which the evacuation Ox D'thala has been ordered. He or another Political Officer may possibly, if the use of the Aden Proop above sketched be approved, remain at Slieikh Otlimn. to organise and supervise the system of patrolling suggested and to deal promptly with any information which may cone in of natters calling for attention in the Hinterland.

Following from Resident at Aden, 4th September is repeated lor mlormation :— . Amended agreements sent to Jacob, with instructions to ascertain informally willingness of Chiefs to execute them, and, if acceptable, to conclude them. Although anxious to effect early withdrawal, we have delayed so long that I would ask to be allowed to use my discretion as to the exact date of leaving Dthala. I deprecate anj^ appearance of undue preci pitation. What was advisable in February last is not necessarily so at this season. Carriage must be collected, and there is no accommodation in Aden for extra 300 men. In this great heat medical authorities object to tents, rightly I think. Meanwhile, arrangements proposed in my No. 4998, dated 11th August, would minimise effect of our withdrawal, and do much to facilitate subsequent arrangements. I propose, therefore, pending further orders, to withdraw Political Agent to Nobat, about end of September, with drawing his escort to Aden for embarkation to India 11th October, but leaving Nobat garrisoned as at present.” Resident had not, when telegraphing, received orders contained in your telegram of 3rd September about agreements, which was repeated to him on 4th for guidance. Proposals in Resident’s letter of 11th August refer to definition of limit, alluded to in paragraph 3 of your Despatch'of 4th May 1906, within which internal disturbances will call for interposition, and of reorganisation of Aden troop for the purpose of policing area within the limit. These proposals have not yet been considered by Bombay Govern ment, and, in view of your instructions, Political Agent’s withdrawal from Dthala can evidently not be delayed pending their consideration ; but, in circumstances stated, we think it reasonable to allow Political Agent period till the end of September for completion of withdrawal, and to permit him to make Nobat his headquarters, and to retain British garrison there until Resident’s proposals of 11th August have been considered. Subject to your consent, we propose instructing him accordingly, and approving suggestion that escort should leave Aden in October.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department 3rd September 1907.

I presume that Articles 1 and 2 really refer to depredations committed by the tribesmen or peoples of the territory of the chief concerned; while Article 3 refers to perpetrators living beyond the chief’s control. If so, Article 3 seems a trifle superfluous. In my opinion, though I believe I am in the minority, some differentiation should be made between these different personali ties, for the responsibility devolving on a chief by reason of depredations ot criminal and roving tribes from without his territory should not be placed m the same category as that incurred from the crimes of his own people. In this case, Article 3 should be made more explicit. Article 7. I would omit the words « when they please ” and say ' shall visit Aden with our recommendatory letters.” The number of recommendatory letters received are excessive and need to be checked. Article 8. After the words 'undertakings and engagements” I would insert the words 'being faithfully and wholly carried out.for “ and *' him chose He knows SS.T»«” “ dd “' to his claims of suzerainty which we would foster. , { .

Baneoek, Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden, dated the 19th July 1907s Articles T and 2 of the draft agreement refer to depredations committed bv anvbodv within the territorial limits concerned. Article 3 is therefore not superfluous. No such differentiation as Major Jacob favours would, I think, prove feasible or satisfactory and none was ever made m Kathiawar. Ihe principle of territorial responsibility pure and simple should be insisted upon. 2 Article 1 is based upon Article 1 of all recent treaties, e.g., with the tipper Aulnki Sultan, 1904, with the Amir of D’thala, 1904, etc., etc. The obiect desired might be achieved by the following modification of the last sentence • “They shall be treated with respect, and those of them to whom enph n iiriviie° , e mav be accorded by the Political Resident upon the recom mendation of the Sheikh shall be given passes to carry arms and entertained for a reasonable period as the guests of Government . 3. The proposed modification of Article 8 may be approved. 4 To foster the Amir’s suzerainty, the following article might he added after Article 8 in the Kotaibi Treaty: 64 9. The payment aforesaid shall be made to us through the Amir of ID’thala to whom we are still under obedienceas heretofore. And we hereby undertake to continue to conform to fight his enemies in the same way as he undertakes to assist enemies who may attempt to molest us.” to his summons us against any 6. As to the special article applicable to the Kotaibi the might be attained by the addition of the following clause’« * and a reasonable supply of ammunition will be furnished to desired object him hereafter for the same on payment.” p* -^ s to the special article applicable to the Haushabi Sultan, the word and is a clerical error and should be “ or The same addition as that pro posed above might be made regarding the ammunition. 7. As to the Alawi Agreement, it would scarcely seem necessary to make special mention of the fact that the Kotaibi are included in the term “ friends and allies of the British Government ” referred to in article 7. 8. As to paragraph 6 of the Resident’s letter No. 4310, dated the 13th July 1907, this was written with due deliberation, and I would still urge that it would be both more expedient and economical to destroy Suleik lort after the Political Agent and his escort have actually withdrawn from D’thala itself. If it is desired to witness the working of the scheme of redistribution “ in situ”, then the Political Agent’s stay at Dthala should be considerably pro longed. 9. I attach drafts of three complete revised agreements with the Kotaibi, ’Alawi and the Haushabi. Whereas it is desirable that no delay or inconvenience should be caused to travellers upon the roads and that all thieves, delinquents and criminals should he checked from their misdeeds and punished, this agreement has been made with the Political Resident, Aden.

My de spatch of June 11th approved arrangements proposed to give effect to with drawal on understanding that redistribution of posts was acceptable to tribes, that posts to be maintained were necessary, and that arrangements would not give rise to fresh disputes. If, as now seems probable, the necessity for embody ing those arrangements in formal agreements is cause of difficulty, why cannot the arrangements originally contemplatedin Resident’s letter of January 27th, so far as sanctioned by my despatch, be carried out with consequent withdrawal without delay ? I have not seen the terms of the agreements, but, if they are not immediately accepted by tribes without protest from any other tribes who may consider themselves concerned, they should be reported for orders.( No. 5139, dated-Bombay Castle, the^nd July 1907 (Secret).

From-LiEUTENANT-Cor.oNEL P. R. Legh, Acting Political Resident, Aden, To The Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay,Political Depaitment. ith reference to correspondence ending with your telegram dated the 9th July ly()\ relative to the withdrawal of the Political Agent from D'thala and the arrangements to be made for the purpose of ensuring the safety of the Aden !) thala Road, I have the honour to submit the following report on the points alluded to in Foreign Department telegram, dated the 27th June last. 2. From the attached copy of a memor mdum, No 427, dated the 7th July 1907, which has been received from the Political Agent, Lthala. it will be observed that, though he dwells at some length upon the fact that the Amir’s suzerainty is a convenient fiction and urges that it is to Government alone that the Kotaibi Tribe will admit real responsibility, he at the same time does not anticipitate that fresh difficulties will arise from theschene of paying the Kofaibi tribe the proposed stipend through the Amir of Dthala, and htlieves that he can arrange for it to be now agreeably received through the Amir’s medium. 3. Under the circumstances, there would seem to be no reason why this arrangement should not be now effected, and the Amir’s concurrence formally obtained to the proposed agreement with the Kotaibi ’tribe. 4. The drift agreements, which are herewith submitted for the consideration of Government (Appendix “A”), contain no actual mention of suzerainty or mediation, but if Government think it expedient that more prominence should be given to these features the desired etfect can be obtained by slight modifica tion of the preamble and of Article 8. 5 lu the case of the Haushabi Tabe, with whom we hnve a separate Pro tectorate Treaty, the existence of Abdali suzerainty and mediati &gt;n was made the subject of a separate and personal agreement between the Chiefs concerned In 895. But as we have no such treaty with the Kotaibi Tribe, Government may think it expedient that a different course should be adopted in regard to them. And as Major Jacob is of opinion that this can be arranged without difficulty, special mention of the Amir’s mediation might accordingly be made in Article 8 of the suggested agreement with the Kotaibi. A similar course would not seem to be necessary in the case of the Haushabi agreement. 6. As to the pioposed redistribution of posts, Major Jacob anticipates no difficulties, and suggests immediate action. But I am of opinion that it would be inexpedient to destrov the Suleik Post until the proposed agreements have been concluded, and the Political Agent has himself withdrawn from D thala to Nobat Dakim The post at Dnr Al Quabtan nfght he destroyed after the pro. posed agreements have been concluded, as soon as the Political Agent canen venientlv arrange for its destruction with the Alawi bheikh. n 0 a 14 D'lUin mielit be formally banded orer to the Abdali Snltan,* by whom a small jja ° r^rricnn jg already maintained there, * E .

They have not yet been commented on bv the Political Agent, iTthala, but copies, together with a copy of this letter, are being furnished to him at once, and any remarks or suggestions of import ance wtich he may have to urge regarding them will be communicated with the least possible delay. 0 Meanwhile I attach, for ready reference, copies of the marginally noted agreements, as a separate Appendix “ B” .which have previously been concluded with the tribes concerned, and of the agreement which the Kotaibi Chief refused to sign in 19QA 1 .—H*ushabi Treaty, 1695 .

Hinterland politics ever were a Kaleidoscopic aspect. The Kotaihi tribes men are not under Amiri control, nor indeed have they ever been so. Hinter land History will corrobarate this assertion. I believe that the concessions mentioned in paragraph 9 of the above quoted Government of India's despatch are altogether suitable and imperative. I cmnot predict—although elsewhere I have recommended this course—the final working of the policy of paying the stipend through Amir Shaif. This point I can forthwith elucidate by calling a meeting of the Chiefs concerned. This need not delay the presentation to the Kotaibi Chief of the stipend and arms, for in spite of my statement of the relative positions of the Amir of IFthaia and the Kotaibi tribesmen, I believe I can arrange for the stipend being now agreeably received through the Amir’s medium. The end in view is sound and if attained—as I think very probable—will serve to enhance the Amir’s importance, and will turther tend to militate against the general dis integration (so visible everywhere) of the Amir’s suzerainty. With an eminent wr iter and present day statesman I would ask ** what purpose is served by an ideal (here Amiri suzerainty, if it is not to make a guide for practice and a land mark in dealing with the real” (here tribal democracy) :—and again, “if an ideal has no point of contact *\ith what exists it is probably not much more than the rapid outcome of intellectual self- indulgence. If it has such point of contact, then there is sure to be some thing which a man can do towards the fulfilment of his hopes ”. The least we can do is to keep in view this goal of Arairi suzerainty how ever nebulous it may now indeed appear.s, rety oH he^at'f tL ? ‘f&gt;« Kotaibi and all the tribesmen should be led to see that it is the” Great Govern! ment wh.ch .s mterested in peace and security on the trade-rout™ With thisend achieved the chain of responsibility may profitably be seen to pass a ong Amin channels I am very strong in the idea that mere control of ■Arab by Arab is incompatible with Arab ideas. My intercourse with Arabs of every sort and cond.tion in this Hinterland has shewn me most conclusively' that, back of all administration, the spectable of a Great Government approach, able in the lole of Final Arbiter is the one doctrine that appeals to the Arab mind. ^Nothing short of this will satisfy the people. Let the stipend, then, be paid through the Amir, but let us not remain outside the ring as passive spectators, leaving the tribesmen to the Amir as suzerain and obscuring the fact of their, responsibility to Government. As an illustration: in 1888, in the presence of the Resident, General Hogg, the Kotaihi Chief (the piesent incumbent) waived his claim to the receipt of transit dues provided he were allowed to send recommendatory letters to the Residency direct. This was a principle long in vogue, and it is only recently that we have striven (I confess with but partial success) to deal with this tribe through the Amir's medium. 3. Brought to the front, as now contemplated, and appointed a guardian of the road, the Kotaibi tribe will naturally not accept Amiri Headship solely, nor even mainly. They will know that 'the source of the stipend is the Gov ernment, and to Government they will look. The Amir’s suzerainty will remain, as ever, a convenient fiction. It is the goal for which we make : that is all. The Kotaibis have good reason to dread our might. The Amir’s weak ness they have proved. To know that they are ultimately responsible to Government will improve the quality of their work. I am no advocate of med dlesome action nor do I ask that we should administer in any way these tribal affairs : that is the other extreme. 4 To sum up I have no good reason to foresee the genesis of fresh disputes from the scheme of paying the Kotaibi through the Amir, as above dehned by me. 5. Again, I do not anticipate any tribal difficulties from the redistribution of the posts as suggested— {a) Nobat Dakim might be at once handed over to the ’Abdali Sultan. {h) Suleik Fort might be razed and the troops, for a time, convenient ly strengthen the D’thala garrison by an additional 75 men (Mahomedans). (c) “Dar al Quabtan” might be demolished also, and the ’Alawi Chief given pecuniary aid to erect a tower within his limits proper. We paid him Rs. 500 to erect the present tower. My suggestion w ill preclude any injury of his susceptibilities. 6. After hearing from the Resident, I will call a representative conference of Chiefs and explain their several prospective duties. ith this done , the arms given, and stipends arranged, I will engage to evacute D thala after one month.L 1 I ! f L*(-r h APPENDIX “A.” Whereas it is desirable that no delay and inconvenience should he caused to travellers upon the roads and that all thieve^ “en should he checked from their misdeeds and punished, this A D re.ment has been made with the Political Resident, Aden.

Most Arabs say that the Imam has no hostile intentions against ns, but would cultivate our friendship. Others, however, say that his Lieutenants would first settle with the Turks and then try conclusions with us; that their bands are too full at present with the Turks. 3. There is a man recently came from Yemen via J Hff ir (partly Amiri) to Dthala and vicinity. He has celebrated three “ Maulids (feasts), and prophesies some happenings after the 4th. His name is^ unknown. I have^had him closely watched. He styles himself ‘‘Al Majnun . He is believed to be an emissary of the Imam and to be sounding the Arabs of these parts. He has now returned to J. Harir, and is said to carry a permit from the Amir’s son, Nasr, to build a fort there. I am enquiring. This * Al Mainun *'* says that from next month, i.e., from Rajah, will open a new era in which many things will happen. He will not define. ^ ^ The Arabs here generally predict, that from Rajah 132o A. H. (curren Armageddon.

This action of ours^ will be read by him as signifying sympathy with the Turks. lie will not see in it our strict impartiality. ###**** : | fk 1- fi No. 150-P., dated Bombay Castle, the 5th August 1907 (Secret). From—II. O. Quin, Esq., Acting Secretary the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to invite a reference to the letter No. 4198, dated the 20th July 1907, from the Political Eesident, Aden, on the subject of the conclusion of agreements with certain Arab Chiefs prior to the departure of the Political Agent from Dthala, a copy of which has been forwarded direct to the Govern ment of India by the Political President. 2. I am to state that the Governor in Council concurs generally in the opinion of the Political Eesident as to the desirability of concluding agree ments with the tribes in question, and is of opinion that the agreements as at first submitted by the Political Eesident may be approved with certain modifications. In Article 7 of the agreements the modification suggested by Captain Hancock in his note of 19th July 1907, a copy of which accompanied the Political Eesident’s letter No. 4198, dated the 20th idem, is an improvment, but the words “may be given” should be substituted for the words “shall be given” in that Article. The words “ and allies ” should, it is thought, be omitted from Article 7 of the Kotaibi Agreement as they are held to be under the suzerainty of the Amir of Dthala. After the words “ undertakings and engagements ” the words “being faithfully and fully carried out” might be inserted in Article 8. With a view to maintain the suzerainty of the Amir of Dthala over the Kotaibi while laying no great obligation on the tribe, it appears to the Govern ment of Bombay desirable that in the agreement with that tribe Article 9 should read as follows :— “ 9. The payment aforesaid shall be made to us through the Amir of Dthala to whom we are still under obedience in accordance with the agreement of 15th November 1888”. It seems to the Governor in Council inadvisable to bind the Kotaibi to fight in the Amir’s quarrels. 3. As regards the destruction of the fort at Dar-al-Quabtan, I am to invite a reference to the telegram from the Political Eesident, Aden, dated the 13th July 1907, which was repeated to the Government of India with my telegram, dated the 16th idem. The Dar will apparently be destroyed at the time of concluding the agreement, and the Alawi present should not be given until the Dar has been destroyed. It would seem desirable however to insert in Article 9 of the Alawi Agreement before the words “ to erect ” the words “ to destroy the post at Dar-al-Quabtan and ”. 4. The Governor in Council concurs in the opinion of the Political Eesident that Suleik fort should not be destroyed till the Political Agent and his escort have been withdrawn from Dthala and are on their way to Nobat Dakim. 5. I am to forward copies of the agreements in the form in which the Governor in Council is of opinion they should be approved, and to request that the Government of India may be moved to accord early sanction to their being concluded with the tribes concerned. The Political Agent will be instructed to leave Dtliala within one month of the receipt by him of the orders of the Government of India relating to these agreements and presents.No. 152-P., dated Bombay Castle, the 6th August 1907 (Secret).

Foreign Secret. Yemen affairs. Following from Vice-Consul, Hodeida :— “ [Report of] capture of Rada reached me several days ago, and is probably correct. There appears to be great activity amongst' scattered bands of insurgents throughout Yemen. Hifash mountain position, north east of Hodeida, occupied by rebels. Rumoured that Taweela has fallen. Trouble in Eastern Yemen serious, districts of Otma and Osab-el-Ali fallen.” Political Resident at Aden also telegraphed, 13th July, that he was receiving reports that Imam forces were not far from Kataba. Major Jacob, in his diary of week ending 26th May, refers to existence of communications between Imam and Abdali Sultan. If Imam secures autonomy of Upper Yemen, his boundary will march with ours, and question of nature and channel of communications with him will require early consideration. So fai no reply has been made to any of his advances. His success against Turks may encourage difficulties in our hinterland. Tour oiders foi evacuation o Dthala have been duly communicated, and action no doubt is being taken. From Viceroy, 23rd July 1907. Foreign Secret, Please see our telegram of 20th July, Yemen affairs. Following telegram received from Resident at Aden, dated 16th July :— “Major Jacob confirms news of capture of Rada by Imam’s forces, and reports Mullah also captured. Yarim Damar besieged, and fighting general near Nadara, twelve hours from Kataba. He reports that local feeling among Arabs and Jews is that there will be general Armageddon this year and shortly. He again deprecates lack of response to Imam’s past advances and suggests some sort of sympathetic message even now, which he could arrange to convey.” •From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, lAith June 1907. i .• For l ® 1 ^ n pecret. Aden. Your Secret letter No. 74, dated 25th April last. Despatch goes by this mail. I approve proposals made in paragraphs 9-12 of your letter, on the understanding that Resident is satisfied that scheme ot paying Kotaibi tribes through Amir of Dthala will not occasion fresh disputes, and that redistribution of posts is so arranged as to he acceptable to tribes concerned. It is presumed that payment of increased Haushabi stipend through Ahdali Sultan and transfer to him of post at Nobat Dakim, v ill cause no difficulty. Proposal that these arrangements should be introduced before Political Officer finally leaves Dthala is approved on understanding that be does not prolong his stay there for more than one month after receipt by him of orders. This accords with Resident’s letter of 27th January last in which, having before him question of increase of stipends and redistribution of posts, he approved date suggested by Political Officer for latter’s withdrawal, viz., 28th February. Jacob will of course act in spirit of policy declared by His Majesty’s Government in adjusting any difficulties that may arise. Except on occasions of undoubted emergency, no action of the kind suggested in paragraph 14 of your letter should be taken without previous reference to me.

I have no desire to minimise the difficulties which, as you point out, beset the Amiri frontier, whether from tribal disturbances, or from disputes between the Arabs on our side of the border and the Turkish authorities, or possibly from intrigues by the Imam. But the further reports furnished with your letter * See telegram of 13th March 1907. .... 17 . . confirm the view* I have already expressed that the presence of an officer on the spot must lead to a degree of interference with tribal affairs altogether inconsistent with a reversion to the former policy of non-intervention which His Majesty’s Government consider it essential to effect. The Resident in his letter of the 12th January 1907t states that the accounts received from the Political Officer as to the hostilities then proceeding between the Amir of Dthala and his tribesmen, tended to show that “ little or “ nothing has been effected by our recent stay in Dthala towards con- “ solidating the Amir’s dominions, and that in view* of the weak “ and avaricious nature of that ruler, any attempt to do this by the “ temporary support of British bayonets Avas foredoomed to failure.” In his letter of the 17th Eebruary + No. 1084. 1907J the Resident expresses the view r that “ upon the natural declension of the Amir’s power tribal “ affairs wall in due course settle down and matters find their ow T n “ level.” And his letter of the § No. 22o2. eth March 1907§ reports that the Amir appears now to be making a a irtue of necessitA, to Iiua e “realised the futility of his former aspirations and methods,” and to be4 * No. 6140. t No. 249 E.B. adopting a new policy towards the tribes “calculated to lead to a moi settled condition of the various districts nominally under his control. The detailed reports of the Political Officer make it clear that this satisfactory change in the Amir’s conduct is due to his having learn that he can no longer count on such assistance from the British escort as was rendered him on the occasion of the tribal fighting repor e m the letter from the Bombay Government of the 5th September 1906 I agree in tlie view expressed m your letter of the 24th Januaryf to the Bombay Government that the incident was one which should certainly 1^ been reported by telegraph. 3. I see, therefore, no reason to modify my views as to the expe diency of an early withdrawal of the Political Officer from Dthala , an Your Excellency agrees that, if this is to be so, there is no materia advantage in postponing his departure. You propose to provide foi t e safety of the Aden-Dthala route, when this takes place, by means o agreements with the Kotaibi, Haushabi, and Alawi tribes, making them responsible for the portion of the road passing through their respective territories. 4 I approve the proposals made in paragraphs 9-12 of your letter for an increase of stipends and gifts of rifles and ammunition, and for a redistribution of posts along the road, on the understanding that the Besident is satisfied that the scheme of paying the Kotaibi tribe throng i the Amir of Dthala will not occasion fresh disputes, and that the redistribution of the posts is so arranged as to he acceptable to the tribes concerned. I desire to he informed in due course as to the number and location of these several posts, with a statement of the necessity for their maintenance. The payment of the increased Haushabi stipend through the Ahdali Sultan, through whom the existing stipend is paid, and the handing over to him of the post at Nohat Daldm, will presumably cause no difficulty. 5. I also approve the proposal that these arrangements should he brought into force before the Political Officer is allowed finally to leave Dthala, on the understanding that Major Jacob is not to prolong his stay there for more than a month after his receipt of these orders, and that he is to adjust any difficulties that may arise in the spirit of the policy which His Majesty’s Government have declared. I observe that the Besident in his letter of the + Xo - o93i 27th January 1907 £ at which time the question of the increase of stipends and the redistribution of posts was before him, approved the 28th February, proposed by the Political Officer, as the date for his withdrawal. 6.

To The Eight Hon’ble JOHN MOELEY, O.M., Sis Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 25th April 1907. Sib, We have the honour to refer to your telegram, dated 8th January 1907, ( /^ ' ! ° 1 in which you requested that the Political Officer at D’thala might he instructed to furnish, as soon as practicable, a report as to the date when his withdrawal would he possible, and as to the means of conducting frontier affairs after his withdrawal. We have also to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram, dated the 13th March 1907, on the same subject. 2. We forward herewith copies of our recent correspondence with the Government of Bombay, from which you will see that both the Bombay Government and the Political Eesident are of opinion that an early date should be fixed for the withdrawal, since, if the tribes realise that Major Jacob’s stay among them is to be merely temporary, any advice that he may give them is not likely to result in an arrangement of a lasting nature. As, however, the situation is somewhat complicated, and as local dissensions among the tribes do not apparently involve any danger to Major Jacob, we have taken advantage of the discretion, which you granted us in the matter of fixing the date for the withdrawal, and have ordered him to remain at D’thala pending receipt of your final instructions. 3. The presence of a Political Officer at D’thala has hitherto been of advantage in three ways. Pirstly, he has been able to afford valuable assistance to the Eesident in the settlement of inter-tribal quarrels, and thereby has contributed to the safety of the trade route. Secondly, he has exercised his influence to check Turkish intrigues in the protected territory, to adjust disputes between Turkish subjects and our tribesmen, and to prevent violation of the frontier by either party. Thirdly, he has kept a watchful eye on the conflict between the Turks and the Arabs in the Yemen, and has prevented the tribes on our side of the frontier from being drawn into the struggle. 4. As instances of the successful results which have recently attended his efforts in connection with the protection of the trade routes and the manage ment of local border affairs, we may mention that he succeeded in restrain ing the Kotaibis from joining in an attack on the Amir of D’thala, he brought about a lull in the serious fighting between the Amir and the Shairis which has eventualIv led to a reconciliation, and he was able by communication with the Kaimmakam of Kotaba to prevent an incursion of Turkish subjects as re- . .. inforcemeuts for the Amir’s enemies. But for Major Jacob s interposition in the latter case, the fighting might have extended in such a manner as to lead to interference by the Turks on the ostensible pretext of protecting their own2 £ ♦ subiects. Pin ally, the Politieal Agent has been able to secure the restoration of three ruined boundary pillars on the demarcated frontier, a matter which io might have been difficult of arrangement from Aden. ^ 5. All these incidents, in our opinion, and in the opinion of the Bombay Government and the local authorities, illustrate the advantage of maintain ing an officer permanently at D’thala with reference to the fhst two consi derations mentioned in paragraph 3 above. It is understood, however, that His Maiesty’s Government have definitely decided not to retain an officer perma nently or for an indefinite period at D’thala for these purposes, and consider that the recent treaties of demarcation and Protectorate ought to strengthen the hands of the Political authorities at Aden sufficiently to permit of the resumption of a policy of inactivity in this region. It only icmains therefore to consider, whether an early withdrawal would be prejudicial to our interests as regards the struggle between the Imam and the Porte. 6. As regards this point attention is invited to General.DeBrath’s letter No. 6560, dated 4th November 1906, in which he informed us that the Imam of Yemen had been making overtures to the Abdali Sultan and that he was anxious to enter into a treaty of alliance with the British Government. Ihe situation in Yemen is still very unsettled, and the Porte have apparently found it necessary to despatch a commission comprising leading Mullas to effect a settlement*by pacific means which they have hitherto failed to secure hy force of arms. Our latest advices point to a' recrudescence of fighting between the Turks and Arabs, it is by no means improbable that the Imam will make further endeavours to attract protected Chiefs to his side. &gt;o long as our Agent is at D’thala, we are likely to get timely intelligence of such intrigues, and Major Jacob will be able, by his personal influence, to frustrate them. After the withdrawal, however, it is quite possible that they may flourish undetected, and serious complications might conceivably ensue. His Majesty’s Govern ment will doubtless consider, in this connection, the representation which Sir N. O’Conor has already submitted to Sir E. Grey in his letter No. 540 of 7th August 1906 as to the advisability of withdrawing the Political Agent while the Yemen is still in a disturbed and critical condition. 7. If, however, His Majesty’s Government hold it unnecessary, even with reference to affairs in the Yemen, to retain a post of observation at D’thala, then, much as wq shall regret the abandonment of the political position at D’thala, we can only agree in the opinion expressed by the Bombay Govern ment and the Political Besident, to the effect that the further retention of the Political Agent, if this is given out or known to be for a purely temporary purpose only, will probably not be of much advantage as regards the protection of the trade route or the management of local border aff airs. 8. The Political Resident has, however, recommended strongly that, simultaneously with the withdrawal, certain arrangements should be made for the purpose of ensuring the safety of the Aden-D’thala road. Briefly, his scheme is that agreements should be entered into with the Kotaibi, Haushabi, and Alawi tribes with the object of making them responsible for safeguarding portions of the road which pass through their territories. 9. In the first place we may consider the arrangements proposed with regard to the Kotaibis. The Chief of this tribe has recently addressed to the Political Officer at D’thala a notice in which he has threatened, as soon as the Government post is withdrawn, to “consider his own convenience”. Major Jacob interprets this to mean that he will commence to exact dues from travel lers on his portion of the Aden-D’thala road as he did in former times. The Kotaibi tribe, belongs to the Radfan group, which is in nominal subordination to the Amir of D’thala, but although the Amir has been granted a special addition to his subsidy in order to enable him to maintain a foice of 50 men for the purpose of keeping the Aden-D’thala road safe, yet the control exercised by him is very slight. The opinion of the Political Resident is that, unless the Kotaibi Chief is attached to our interests by some special concession, there will be reason to anticipate a reimposition of the vexatious dues upon passing caravans and a general recrudescence of the disorder which led to the last Kotaibi expedition of 1903. He accordingly recommends that a stipend ofRs 50 n innr.tli mnv l,e pn.d to the Kotaibi Chief through the Amir of D’.hala rn ' h&lt; ‘ ma -y,, be /-'ranted a present of 50 rifles «i,b 100 rounds of fimmm ition per rifle. I n return for this concession the tribe would he heU respousihle loi the safety ot the Habilen portion of the Aden-DMinla road Although under the terms of the Amir’s treaty with us, he oueht to be able to keep the Kotaihis in order without further assistance, vet. as he obv.ousiy cannot do so, we propose, with your approval, to sanction the arrangement suggested, winch is approved by the Bombay Government. - p 10. Next, as regards the Alawi tribe. They at present receive a stipend of Ks. 50 a month, an amount which is considered inadequate by the Resident. He therefore recommends that it may be doubled, subject to die condition that the Alawi shall he responsible for the safety of the portion of the eastern trade route Tying between Jimil and A1 Hajar. The Resident also recommends that the Alawi Chiei s post at a place calted Dar-al-Quabtan may be moved to a village called Mabaja^where he should be required to maintain 20 efficient men, the post at Dai-al-Quabtan being dismantled. The object of this measure is, apparently, to reduce the chances of fighting between the Kotaibis and Alawis, who are at enmity with one another. The Bombay Government have made no recommendation on the subject of the proposed stipend for the Alawi, hut as the arrangement seems to us to he a suitable one, we propose with your approval to sanction the payment of this allowance direct to the tribe. The post at Dar-al-Quabtan will be dismantled in the manner suggested. As a further insurance against trouble with the Alawis it is contemplated that on our withdrawal the post of Suleik, which is at present garrisoned by us, should be destroyed; since if it were left standir g it would fall into the hands of the Kotaibis and would be used by them as a base of attack against the Alawis. 11. It remains to consider the recommendation as regards the Haushabi. ; The Resident proposes that the stipend already received by the Haushabi Sultan; should be increased by Rs. 50, and that he should be given 50 Martini-Henry rifles and 1,000 rounds of ammunition to assist him in guarding the portion of the road from Nobat Dakim up to Jimil and also the Mavia caravan road. The Government of Bombay in their letter No. 7037, dated The 10th November 1906, have recommended that any pressure wffiich it. is desired to bring to bear on the Haushabi should he exerted through the Abdali Sulfan of Lahej. In making this recommendation they refer to a letter No. 1804, dated the 5th March 1906, in which they urged the adoption of a policy of bolstering up the Sultan of Lahej against the sub-tribes. There are various objections which may be advaneed against this policy as a general principle, but, in the present case, as the Haushabi stipend is now paid through the Abdali Sultan, there seems to be no reason why, if the increased stipend is to be granted, it should not be paid in the same way. We, therefore, propose with your approval, to concur in the proposed arrangement. 12. Finally, the Resident recommends that, the post at Nohat Dakim should be handed over to the Abdali Sultan. It appears that the Abdali Sultan has a right to possess the fort when it is evacuated by us, and the Resident’s proposal may accordingly be accepted. 13. We venture to think that there is every reason why the measures devised by General DeBrath with a view to apportioning responsibility for the road should be brought into force before Major Jacob leaves D’thala, since, otherwise, the withdrawal might be the signal for ourr^es on the road and disturbances amomr the tribes which would make the situation a very difficult one for the Resident to deal with from Aden. We would, therefore, suggest tiiat the Resident should be directed to introduce these arrangements without delav, after which the withdrawal may be effected, at the discretion of the Resident at the earliest convenient date. 14. With regard to the conduct of affairs after the withdrawal, we concur with the Political Resident that it will be advisable, in order to assist the nego tiations of the Resident with the tribes and with the Turkish authorities, that a Political Officer should occasionally be deputed with an escort to the frontier. We cannot conceal from ourselves that these visits will be attended by some risk, but the Resident will no doubt take every precaution to minimise this andwill not send the Political Agent when the country is disturbed. The strength of the escort required on each occasion may, as suggested by the Political Resident, be fixed by him with re erence to the object of the visit and the strength of the tribes. Pending receipt of a reply to this despatch we are consulting the Pombav Government as to what reanangement of the Residents staff should be made' in consequence of the withdrawal of the Agent from D’thala. We have the honour to be, Sib, Your most obedient, bumble servants,SIMLA. FOREIGN DEE A.RTMENT SECRET. External. No. 74, dated the 25th Apbid 1907.

After an interval another shell was another to the south and short of the village. As the fitting continued, the Shairis having worked round towards the norttneast of Dthala, I had, at intervals, six shells two into the town itself. Jbe effect was exeunt and for^ time^fig t^g withdrawi^^t'the s^ame^ime'theTmiri^soldierJ on Ihe “Hogs hack' were replaced by British troops. The Amir begged me to interfere still more, for he was apprehensive for the safety of Dthala town. His men, too, lacked ammunition. I he should send for reinforcements, and if the Shairis were too strong for hu , would afford the requisite co-operation: that he was hound to dls ? J capabilities in accordance with the treaty obligations, °^ r , ^ tion day being more to signify Government’s displeasure and their determination to‘support the Amir who was not the aggressor m the fight. I was extremely averse to parficipate, as I feared a complete set -^k to the work of twenty months of attempted reconciliation, hut my action absolutely imperative. The effect on the Shairis was magical. The people returned that evening, and in convocation sent me word that they did not wis o P r0 ° n § _ ^ were friends of Government, and did not believe their action would have proved so distasteful to me (sic). Yesterday I visited Jalila with Major Koe and convened all theSbairi Akils. I also visited the town and was shown the spots where the two shells hurst. No damage was done to life or property. ^ f rom myself have even improved and doubtless, from what I hay ’ yesterday conversation with Siiairis and others m my walks m the Sham c JJ tliese and to day, I am convinced that this and this alone will tenc from assaults in future improbable. To threaten punishment an esteem my threat would have weakened the hold I have over these peop f i ras tic me, and not the Amir, as their father and counsellor To have omitted so drastic a threat would have spelt chronic disturbance and our arrival shoitly a impasse. Another prime factor impelling me to resort extraction and Wednesday was that the lately murdered Sham was of „ £ the village had appealed to Sheikh Ah Mohsm, “the pillar-breaker, 2 u~f feLl ^ ,icb h0 ' d Shaib in a PP a “^. for redress of its wrongs, it nas been my endeavour for some time to checkmate fln'a intervention, and I have used Sheikh Ali Mohsin to this end. ^e^s^ especially interested to make reparation for his past misdeeds. I think I have succeede/ of ^ en the u ^ ex P ected tlia t happens and it was necessary to nip this insurrection in the hud, rather than face the possibility of increased and active ghting which would have necessitated our intervention on a larger scale, and have exposed our numerical weakness, which I consider a grave political error. Moral support of the Amir is our role, but this phrase would have been meaningless on Wednesday and mischievous in effect if not translated into terms of active co-operation. Yet another factor : Turkish sojourn at Jalila for 30 years. Contempt for the Amir was drilled into the Shairis during that time, and it is absurd to expect to reverse the feeling after a paltry three years’ stay here. It has been mv aim here to reconcile parties, and after 20 months’ patient dealing I have been reluctantly, but imperatively obliged to pursue other tactics. “Nothing succeeds like success ” is an apt maxim for Wednesday’s display. We must show^ the {Shairis that the Amir is their overlord and aid him to consolidate his position by hook or by crook, looking to a time when he may be possibly called upon to stand alone. If he fails, with an unruly people twixt himself and the deserted Turkish border, there will be confusion worse confounded, and a return to affairs analogous to that before 1900, save that the chaos would be still more pronounced. I trust my action will receive your approval. The 17th August 1906. H. E. JACOB. ^With compliments to the Political Eesident.

D«Beath,C.B, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident, To—The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, that a small party of 8 men of the King’s Own Scottish Borderers was fired upon by some Dthambari tribesmen, on the evening of the 4th instant, whilst proceeding trom Dthala to Aden. The incident took place a few miles above Nobat Dakim and is reported by the Political Agent, THhala, to have been due to tribal dis! affection against the Haushabiand the Abdali Sultans. The firin-r took place in the dusk of the evening, and resulted in one private of the King’s Own Scottish Borderers being slightly wounded in the chest, and a camel-driver accompanying the party being wounded in the leg. 2. In reporting this incident for the information of Government, I have the honour to draw attention to the fact that it is one of a series of similar incidents which have now for some time past interrupted the peace of the trade routes, and the safety of our own communications with the Dthala sanitarium, and in regard to which, it seems to me desirable, that some definite line of action should now be adopted with the least possible delay. ,Paragraphs 108 to 116 of General Maitland’s report, of the 12th June 'QlO^on the recent demarcation of the frontier, refer to some of the troubles experienced by the Boundary Commission at the hands of the Dthambari and the Kotaibi tribes; and the reports which have emanated from this Residency concerning the troubles which have been experienced in regard to the Subehi tribes have been numerous and constant. 4. Taking the year 1906 alone, several incidents hare occurred, and con tinue to occur, which are of considerable local importance, and in regard to which it is every day becoming more important that a firmer and more definite policy should be adopted and pursued. 5. The attack on the Nobat Dakim post reported in this office letter No. 381, dated the 21st January 1993, was, as is the case in the present instance, the result of tribal disaffection against either the Abdali Sultan or the Haushabi Sultan, or both. The postal robbery reported in this office letter No. 382, dated 21st January 1906, was similarly mainly the result of tribal dis affection against the Abdali Sultan. In July last, an attack was made by certain Subehis of the Ghaleba tribe upon a herd of cattle which was being taken to Dthala by the Government meat contractor, in which 22 head of cattle were looted in Haushabi limits, C395EDnnd in regard to which a claim for compensation of Rs. 640 is now^outstanding against the Haushabi Sultan. This attack also was probably mainly due to disaffection against the Haushabi. On the 8 th September last, a caravan was attacked by the same clan on its wav from Mavia to Lahej. And quite recently our post at Suteffc has been fired into on three occasions, and the Political Agent, Dthala, reports that these incidents also are probably due to the tribal disaffection of certain of the Radfan trines against the Haushabi and the Abdali Sultans. 6 The affair reported in this office letter No. 5039, dated the 24th August 1906, was of course purely the result of tribal disaffection against the Amir of Dthala. 7 . In brief, practically all the incidents which have of late disturbed the peace of that portion of the Protectorate with which our relations are most intimate, have been due in the main to tribal disaffection against one or more of the three rulers named, the Abdali, the Haushabi, or the Amir of Dthala. And the fact that we have ourselves suffered annoyance is due to the desire of the tribes concerned to thus attract a greater measure of attention to their grievances, whether real or imaginary. 8 At the same time all the incidents referred to, with the exception perhaps of the Sheikh Othman postal robbery case, are matters which should actually he dealt with by the rulers concerned, who, under the terms of their treaties, are bound to secure the safety of the roads leading to Aden. 9 . U p to the present time practically no effective action has been taken by those rulers, either to punish the offenders or to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. On the other hand, the inadequate measures which they have taken have served only to accentuate the disaffection which has caused them. 10. As an instance of the action taken, I would mention that, after the Subehi attack on the caravan proceeding from Mavia to Lahej last month, there was great talk of a joint expedition by the Haushabi and the Abdali to punish the offenders. Upon the Haushabi Sultan’s special request for assist ance, I presented him with 200 rounds of ammunition and a Durbar present of Rs. 500. The result was the interchange of a few shots which led to no casualties on either side, and which were promptly followed by negotia tions conducted by the Abdali leaders. As to these, Major Jacob reports that the Haushabi Sultan was much incensed against the Abdali, “ who bad only accentuated the feud between tbe Haushabi and Subehi while secor- ing himself against the marauders,” and that the Haushabi Sultan was parti cularly exasperated because it was at the Abdali’s instance that the Subehi were in the first place attacked. 11. The futility of such measures as these, and the mischievous effect of such half-hearted and ineffective reprisals have been frequently represented by this Presidency, and are referred to in some detail in Captain Hancock’s memorandum, which accompanied this office letter No. 1150, dated 25th February 1906. The references made in paragraphs 23 and 24 of that memorandum to the arguments adduced by Colonel Mere wether forty years ago are still relevant to the existing condition of affairs in the Aden hinterland. And at the present day the actual benefits which we derive from the various stipends and presents which are disbursed to the Chiefs of this Protectorate, are practically no more than they were in the days when the enrolment of the Aden troop was first sanc tioned by His Majesty’s Government. 12. In my letter No. 3419, dated the 9th June 1906, I have already made certain proposals to Government, the adoption of which I am convinced can alone provide an effective remedy to the evils referred to, Apd J would recommend that these may now receive tbe earliest possible consideration. 23 WQt7 P; \ Gm Government that I have no intention or desire to in anv way interfere w^h the interna 1 and domestic affairs of the tribes where thl can be avoided and that the measures which I have proposed are in m y opinion such as would, m the end, prove the most effective. ^ e ^ my opinion 44 of Captain Hancock’s memorandum of the 22nd e ruary last, there is a reference to the net result of more than 20 years’ ex- Pf proposals which were made by Colonel Merewether hi 1865, nd accepted only alter considerable correspondence and demur by His r. Government. And it is certain that at no time in the history of this Protectorate was there less trouble m the general conduct of political affairs., than during the activity of the Aden troop, as originally constituted, and while the principles enunciated by Colonel Merewether were observed. 15 ; It is since the alterations in the constitution of the Aden troop were made m the year 1891, and since the Political Resident has been vested with a less liberal discretion m regard to the conduct of local affairs, that there has been a gradual relapse to less favourable conditions. I believe that the time has now arrived when the resumption of a firmer policy is essential, not onlv to the successful conduct of political affairs in the hinterland itself, but also to the welfare of the main settlement of Aden. Whether we like it or not we shall sooner or later be forced to adopt such a policy. 16. It is difficult for Government to realise the intense interest with which our present policy is being observed in the hinterland of this Protectorate, or the actual effect ol such events as the long immunity of the murderer of the late Captain Warneford, and also of the petty tribe which so insolently robbed His Majesty’s mail last spring. The Abdali Sultan has more than once asked me why we do not punish | offenders, and has offered pointed remarks on the manner in which we treat well and ill-behaved alke. He lias protested his inability to effectively punish ! the Subehis without our assistance, and has more than Once asked me to support j him with the Aden troop, on the ground that he is acting, or desires to act, in j the interest of Government. I have rejrained from acceding to his request as ! I am aware that proposals of this nature are not likely to be welcomed by His Majesty’s Government at the present time, but such assistance cannot be in definitely postponed, and the result of withholding it may be seen in the abortive expedition described in paragraph 10 above. 17. The tribesmen and their Chiefs of course see that, where formerly prompt action would have been taken by the Aden troop, either with or with out the co-operation of friendly neighbours, there is now delay and of late practically no action at all. And so long as the Political Resident continues unable to exercise bis own immediate discretion in regard to the measures which are needed to repress petty cases of disorder that from time to time arise, and for the present must continue to arise, there is little doubt that there will certainly be no decrease in the number of these unpleasent incidents. 18. I would here state that the area affected by the above remarks is limited, and there are portions of this Protectorate where any sort of interven tion continues at present quite unnecessary. The area affected however is more considerable than what is known on the Somali Coast as the ten-mile limit, and includes the greater part of the western portion of the Protectorate which is traversed by the main trade routes entering Aden from Ottoman territories. To the north and east there is no present necessity for intervention. The Fadthli Sultan, who was formerly our most tiresome enemy, is now a peaceable neigh bour, and though disputes between him and the Lower Yaffai may again arise to give cause to some unrest, it is not probable that this will be of a nature to seriously affect Aden,4 19 It is on the Dthala road, and on the other main routes which lie to the west of that, that unrest is least to he desired and has of late been most, notice able And it is most particularly in regard to these that I would again press upon Government the desirability of firmer measures. A^ain on the western littoral, measures both to repress disorder and to check the mischievous traffic in arms have of late appeared necessary. ^ 20 Reverting now to the particular incidents reported in the commence ment of this letter, I have the honour to state that, with the approval of Gov ernment, I propose to take the following measures. 21 The Dthambari tribe are the most southerly of the Radfan tribes which owe allegiance to the Amir of Dthala, and of late years have been con- sidered as nominally under the Haushabi Sultan, but neither of these Chiefs reallv control them. Nevertheless I propose to press both the Amir of Dthala, on the ground of nominal suzerainty, and the Haushabi Sultan within whose limits the outrage took place, to undertake their correction. And m view of his agreement of 1895 with the Haushabi Sultan referred to in correspondence end ing with your letter ISo 7605 , dated 25th November 1905, I propose to also press the Abdali Sultan to co-operate with the Haushabi in view of the latter portion of clause Till of that agreement. 22 1 propose to give the Chiefs concerned clearly to understand that I look to them to take effective measures both to punish this tribe and to ensure better order in future, in virtue of their treaty obligations, and m consideration of the stipends which they receive. 23. Amongst other measures, I propose to press the Haushabi to establish such further posts on the road, and to maintain such additional forces as may he required, to more effectively safeguard travellers. 24 And lastly I propose to press the Haushahi Sultan for payment to the Government meat contractor of the compensation which I have already referred to, and for which he is liable under Article VI of his agreement of 1895 with the Abdali Sultan. 25. And I would at the same time solicit immediate sanction to the present ation, to the Haushabi S ultan, of the 50 rifles and the 1,000 rounds of ammuni tion already recommended in paragraph 5 of my letter No. • 419, dated the 9th June 1906, and the earliest possible consideration of the urgent desirability of increasing his stipend as also there suggested. 26. In my opinion the corrective effects of the action I here propose will be doubly lasting, if I am permitted to support the forces of the Abdali (and Hau shabi with the Aden Troop. This support would he moral and passive so long as possible, but active if circumstances demanded it. I urge this course be cause it would enable me to make certain that the action taken by the Chiefs concerned was serious and as effective as their means permitted, and, secondly, because I believe that the moral effect of their tribesmen being supported by Government troops would be great. It is in my view most important that we should let offenders see that the bigger Chiefs are acting with the full support and approval of Government, and that we do not intend to permit murder and pillage on the trade routes. 27. To these proposals I have the honour to request that the sanction of Government may, if possible, he accorded and transmitted by telegraph, as, the earlier action is taken the more effective is it likely to be. 4. There has been another outrage on the Dthala road : a small party of the K. O. S. R’s being sniped at near Nobat Dakim on its way down to Aden.

Prom The Hon’ble Sir Steyning W. Edgerley, K.C.Y.O., C.I.E., Chief Secre- tary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. lam directed prefer to my letter No. 7386, dated the 30th October 1906 submitting a report from the Political Kesident, Aden, regarding an attack bv members of the Dthambari tribe on a small party of men belonging to the Amg s Own Scottish Borderers, who were on the march from Dthala to° Aden. 2. With regard to the proposals of the Resident at Aden in that letter, I am to express complete concurrence in the yiew expressed in paragraph 15 that the time has now arrived when the resumption of a firmer policy is essen tial not only to the successful conduct of political affairs in the Hinterland itself but also to the welfare of the main settlement of Aden. There is no doubt that the suggestions made in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the letter are ■worthy of serious consideration with reference to the maintenance of our influ ence not merely in the Aden Hinterland, hut in the Mabomedan world general ly. Such matters are discussed probably throughout the Jfemen and possibly at Mecca, and the result must be harmful to our interests. 3. Passing to the more specific recommendations contained in the letter, I am to invite attention to the letter of this Government, No. 1804, dated the 5th March 1906, paragraph 7, and to express His Excellency’s opinion that any pressure which it is desired to exert on the Haushabi, should be exert ed through the Abdali Sultan of Lahej. His Excellency the Governor in Council would do nothing which will tend to emancipate the Haushabi Sultan from that subordination to the Abdali to which he has up to the present volunta rily resigned himself. 4. With regard to the Dthambari and Kotaibi tribes, I am to point out that they belong to the Radfan group which are in nominal subordination to the Amir of Dthala. The Amir, in accordance with the recommendations in paragraph 3 of the Government of India Secret despatch No. 130, dated the 21st July 1904, was granted a special addition to his subsidy in order to enable him to maintain a small force at Sulek or elsewhere as the Resident might require to render the road safe from the action of these tribes, and it appears to His Excellency the Governor in Council desirable* in pursuance of the poli cy which was placed before the Government of India in my No. 1804, dated the 5th March last, above referred to, to exert whatever pressure it may be decided to exert against that tribe through their own Suzerain the Amir of Dthala and to endeavour to convert his nominal Suzerainty into an actual effective control. 5. To complete the Government of India record, I am to submit copies of the marginally noted correspondence and to invite particular attention to the views of General DeBrath expressed in para graph 14 of this letter and in his letter of the 9th June 1906, as to the value of increased activity of the Aden Troop and to the association therewith of some Arab levies. 6. In conclusion, I am to say that the whole situation in the Hinterland evidently needs, as above pointed out, and has needed for some years or more past, firmer treatment than it is now possible to give under the present centra lised form of administration which requires all matters of importance to be referred for orders to London through Bombay and Simla, and His Excellency the Governor in Council yet hopes that the orders of His Majesty’s Secretary of State may not preclude some action of the nature recommended by the Resident or by this Government or by the Government of India in their des patch to the Secretary of State, No. 119, dated the 9th August 1906. 1 Resident’s No. 1150, dated 25th February 1906, accompaniment*.

From— The Political Resident, Aden, To-The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to my No. 1027, dated the 18th instant, I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a letter Uich I have this week received from the AbdaU Sultan in replfto the letter which with the instructions conveyed in your letter No. 1134, dated the ath instant, and of which I forwarded a copy with my letter above reterred to. 2. It appears that the Abdali Sultan is anxious to continue the tacimon which I had hoped that the last communication _ addressed to him mi ht terminate. The tone in which his present letter is couched is, I fear, not likelv to commend itself to Government. The Sultan evmces an inclination to exaggerate the value d,f his services and to ignore the benefits which e receives from the development of the Settlement and Protectorate of Aden Abdali interests have from the earliest days of our ^Hatci 0 the be m S ttf S tory with ours, and the present Sultan has every reason to regard the past history of our relations with gratitude. 3 . He evidently takes an opposite view of the case and in doing so ventures to impugn our fidelity. 4. It was inevitable that in course of time the Abdali should cease to be the Buffer State between the seat of the Paramount P ?wer and the who the rest of the Protectorate, and I would suggest for consideration that the time has now come for us to ourselves deal with the Subehi problem direct. 5 . The attached copy of a memorandum which I have this week drafted on the subject will indicate the direction in which I would venture to suggest that further action should be taken. Letter dated the 20th February 1906. From—S ultan Sir Ahmed Fadthl, the Abdali, To—The Political Resident, Aden. We have received your letter No. 996, dated the 17th February 1906. In reply we inform your honour, oh friend, that the treaty No. 35, dated the - June 1839, had not been described in the subsequent treaties as being repealea, such as the treaty dated the 7th March 1867 to which reference was made in Article 3 of the Sheikh Othman treaty dated the 7th February ^ 1882. Ihe ao- sence of facts indicating its abrogation is a strong proof of its being still m tore . We do not know, however, what may have been reported to Government againsi us which irritated it inasmuch as it said that the old treaty of many y e ay® standing was rescinded while there was nothing in such treaty except _ that tne hand of Government and our hand should be one against the mischievous people, and in virtue of which the Government had on several occasions supported our late father against the disaffected persons, which fact is screened from you. We have never imagined that the Government wou recompense us by such expression after the lapse of many years and long i 2during which we have been its first friend, rendered at all times all our endeavours m its good friendship, worked in all its interest, we were the first, who assisted Government m inducing the people of the interior and drawing them closer to its alliance and our good behaviour as well as that of our ?hnnu e i SS ° r8 ^ to ali severally and generally. We regret that it hould be said of the Great Government, who is mostly renowned to have been ac mg iaithfully, that after it lias fixed its claws in the extreme limit of the hinterland, and Uie hinterland became open to it through our efforts and we nave sustained in its cause expenses and trouble for a long time, should now commence to recompense us in such a manner as to cancel a treaty which is I 1 C&gt; ir 1 fi l Ur * 10US ^ overrin[iea t while nothing was mentioned concerning its nullification ere now. Oh friend, we cannot oppose Government even if it will declare the revocation of all the treaties. To whom shall we apply to act as an arbitrator between us ? Consequently we shall bear with endurance and refer our grievance to God until the Government should again draw its attention to the right or avert from it. As to the Jabira, we have no more grounds than those already referred to you. If you are inclined to assist us in punishing them and other Subehis and you consider that such is beneficial to you and us, well and good ; otherwise, ^ we are not afraid that our country would be conquered by any of the tribesmen. But as our limits are adjoining yours, your supporting us to keep the abased evil-doers under restraint is of the greatest means for the welfare. We do not know what are the causes which caused your estrangement from us and the detraction of your attention from the treaty for the restoration of tranquillity. If you have an object and you prefer that the Subehis should continue their aggression and plundering the travellers and committing their malicious acts on the routes in order that they may give us trouble and cause us to suffer heavy expenses, and that you •consider that we deserve the same in the face of our good friendship with you such being deplorable case. Kindly communicate this, our whole letter, to the Great Government. Memorandum on the Political affaire of the Aden Protectorate, drafted with special reference to the nature of the Armed Forces which it is desirable to maintain at Aden for local purposes in connection therewith. In the earlier days of the British occupation of Aden peace in the Interior and undisturbed traffic on the roads was most uncertain. The adjacent Arab Chiefs were engaged in constant feuds with one another. Men went about armed either to defend their own lives or to assail a weaker enemy. The country was continually devastated. There was practically no security to life or property. Agriculture was neglected, and the scanty crops raised were liable to be destroyed or carried off by the incursion of our unfriendly tribes. Outside the walls of the Portress the life of a European was unsafe. In the general lawlessness which existed, convoys carrying provisions and stores for the garrison were systematically plundered. On several occasions maraudering bands com mitted their depredations beneath the very walls of the Portress and in sight of the sentries. 2. At that time Aden was comparatively isolated from India. There was no man-of-war regularly stationed in the harbour. No regular line of vessels called. Steam communication between Aden and Bombay occupied 15 days. The Fortress and the town were dependent on the caravan trade for the necessities of life. During a drought a supply of water was brought from Sheikh Othman. The prices of provisions were exorbitant owing to the dangers and exactions incurred by traders on the route to Aden. 3. The naturally fertile plains intervening between Aden and the moun tains, which in older times were richly cultivated, were reduced to a wilderness. 'The people were reduced to a state of great poverty. Every man’s hand was against his neighbour and instead of turning his attention to cultivation his first thought was how to pay off some old plundering scores against a neigh bouring clan or to be ready to resist the aggression of another. A matchlock was in those days never carried without the match being lighted. 34. For some time matters were kept tderablf straight by coaxing and indicious treatment. But on many occasions acute cfistress as caused to the garrison and inhabitants of Aden generally by the roads being dosed and by supplies being stopped from coming in. 5. In those days the Arabs were poorly armed and as an enemy generally looked down upon. They were, however, mobile and active. 6 The necessity for the entertainment of a body of mounted men for the protection of the approaches to the Fortress was first represented by Brigadier- General Coghlan in 1855 who then wrote “ Our vast fortifications while thev effectually defy any land attack upon us cannot protect the road beyond gunshot of the works : our Arab allies are unable to do so : the most obvious remedy, therefore, is that a body of cavalry should form part of this garrison. Having this, the attitude of hostile neighbours w^ould be almost a matter of indifference to us ; and I have no hesitation in declaring my conviction that for the future such stoppages as have harassed us and injured our trade ever since our occupation of Aden would be unknown.” He also wrote :—“ So contemptible is Arab warfare that no body of men v\ bich could be assembled in these parts would dare to appear in the vicinity of a party of well-appointed irregular cavalry.” 7 . At the end of 1855 the Honourable Court of Directors sanctioned a Trocp of Horsemea for Police purposes at Aden, and this was raised at Jaco- babad by volunteers from the Sind Horse. They, however, never reached their destination. They sailed from Karachi on the 20 th April 1856, but when near Aden the ship conveying them turned and went to Bombay where they remained the whole of the monsoon of that year. On the Persian war breaking out at the end of that year, the Commanding Officer volunteered, the services of the troop and went to the Persian Gulf. Afterwards be and his troop were em ployed in the Deccan and in Central India during the mutinies. 8 . At last Brigadier-General Coghlan evidently despairing of ever seeing the troop at Aden recommended their being disbanded. And a camel corps was ordered to be raised in their place. This was formed in Lower Sind and in due course reached Aden. But as on trial it was found that the Indian Camel Sowars could not compete with the Arabs in rapidity of movement or facility in handling the camel, this body was likewise disbanded. 9. In 1865 Lieutenant-Colonel W. L. Merewether again vigorously represented the necessity for the entertainment of a body of mounted men at Aden. He pointed out that though Aden had then been in possession of the British for 26 years and although much had been done to improve relations with our Arab neighbours, matters were still not as they should be and were not on a sufficiently sound basis to enable us to consider ourselves safe from annoyance and even insults at the hands of any dissatisfied Arab Chief who might take it into his head to close the roads and prevent the commonest necessaries, such as grass, grain and wood, from entering Aden for days, causing the greatest inconvenience to troops and townspeople. 10. He furnished a detailed account of the relations then subsisting with our Arab neighbours and made special reference to the troublesome attitude of Ahmed bin Abdulla, the head of the Fadthli tribe. He referred to the Subebis as a large scattered tribe under no particular head, formerly powerful and wealthy, but now weak from internal quarrels and fallen into a great state of poverty, as residing partly in the hills and partly in the plain, and as much given to plundering, but only in small bodies. 11. He pointed out that should safety on the roads be permanently imperilled, the trade, which in spite of many disadvantages had increased and Showed a tendency to still further increase, would be diverted from Aden to some other outlet and either return to Mokha or go to Mokalla. He referred to the general position as “ most undoubtedly derogatory to us as a great power. 12. In referring to the treaty concluded in 1849 with the Sultan of Lahej under which the latter bound himself to keep the roads leading to Aden clear of plundering parties and to protect all merchandise passing through hisrthe^KLtid Ht £Tnot a i v° PlUnder f ’ m ° lested or W«w 4 ™ lmP ° SSible a “ d fOT whic “ stipend paTd'to* ht Abdalfth^Hpend watS^r^nTr n' that &gt; the case of the to°m^ e ^ V J w ^ eu ^ le so^that^little or'twne^of if nn/ ^ ea f t fr, pr ? teC 1 t t ]e ro ^ s » and lu * referred also to the fact that certain e ore we 0 ccupied it. He, however, remarked that these were drawn pendino- ^“ndr;' behaVi ° Ur and W6re WUhheld - improper act^muli Id. He urged that interruptions on the roads then told far more dis- advantageously than they did ten years before on account of the greatly increas ed numbers of peop e living in Aden and the injurious effect it mus/have on oui prestige that tnese contemptible robbers should be able to defy us under our very guns. He urged that something more should be done and that the outlay necessary at first would be more than repaid by the settlement of the country and the cheapening of supplies. . 16. He accordingly recommended that a body of horsemen should be raised for Police service at Aden and that they should be recruited at the head quarters of the Sind Horse at Jacobabad. He recommended that in addition to the troop of India Horse there should be a small Arab Levy, like the Belooch Guides, on the Sind frontier to act as scouts and guides in connection with the troop. As to this Levy he recommended that they should be mounted on camels or horses, as found most convenient, and that the pay given to them should cover everything, the men finding or feeding their owu horses or camels and supplying their own arms. 16. As to the use to which this body should be put he recommended that the troop and guides should he used exactly on the same principle as were so successfully introduced bv t,he late General Jacob in Sind. He proceeded in the following terms “ They would not be suddenly sent here and there haras sing themselves and disordering the country,, but a regular quiet system of patrolling would be established and plunderers at once captured and punished on the spot This would make plundering dangerous and unprofitable so that it would soon become unfashionable. Besides which an orderly body of men carrying with them unmistakable strength moving about the country would instil confidence into the people and enable them to turn their thoughts to peaceable and useful pursuits.” 17. He recommended higher rates of pay for the sowars than those recommended in 1855, but he did this purposely, as he proposed that nothing but the pay should be given with the exception only of water, which alone, he suggested, should be provided free either from the Government tanks or the Government condensers. He referred to the fact that for the levy of 1855 forage and rations were given free in addition to the pay and he said that he thought this a mistake, as it tended to make the men helpless by forcing them as it were to depend upon and look to others. On the other hand, he pointed out that causing them to make their own arrangements about forage, grain, &amp;c., forced the men to enter into close and intimate relations with the people of the country. 18. In regard to this particular point it is interesting to observe that Lieutenant-Colonel Merewether entertained a strong opinion against the plan of giving Silladar Cavalry compensation for high prices of provisions, grain and forage. The following is quoted from his letter on the subject dated 12th September .837:—“ It tends to make the men careless and improvident when they know there is something else to depend upon besides their own resources, and in so doing strikes at the most important and strongest part of the Silladar 5 C115FDI * system, its independence and ^ - fixe(1 in the first instance at such a rate Silladar Cavalry should be c. • c i rcums tances the Silladar should be that except under temporary and P®™ ” receiveSi that he should be able able to maintain its efficiency on^ess ttwnM^ecme^ e j se t0 looU to he to live within his income. he “ „ ith funds of his own to meet M will do so on ordinary occasion _ p rinc ipl e s would seem to afford scope I the pressing want when it comes ihes p j ^ ^ inci l9s for considerable discussion. 1 me ^L q ™,t ablished under which the Aden Troop was at first establis&amp;e . • 4.1 q* j unaerwii j QT .^no-pmpnts were the same as those m the Smd 19.

They feared that a force of that description would embroil them sooner or later with the Arab tribes and that patrolhug the country and cutting up marauders would lead to reprisals They stated that the Arab tribes had a certain interest in maintaining friendly relations with the Br Government owing to the good market which Aden afford^, and they added that they must trust to this motive exercising a proper inauence over tl minds To this Colonel Merewether replied at some length. He laid great stress upon the loss accruing to Government owing to dearness of supphes anJ reneated that high prices were due to the continued misrule in the interior. He urged that it was essentially necessary that some kind of order and seeun y should be established in the country on which we were so dcpendeniHerefer- red to the gret improvement which had been effected m North-We.tern India by measures similar to those which he recommended. He pointed out that the step taken there by the late General Jacob was to secure order and security “ within and immediately beyond the border. 23. He assured Government that there was not the slightest danger ot the plan proposed by him invoking reprisals on us but that it woutd m assuredly put a stop to the reprisals going on between the adjacent trnes were the cause of so much in convenience and distress tons It would, &gt; merely he the strong power stepping in and saying that disorders mu and placing a small body of efficient police to see that order was maintained. 24. To this Government again replied that they were satisfied ^ compliance with Colonel Merewether’s views would lead n . ot expenditure, but also to a more or less general interference m the politic adjoining districts, a result which, they stated, was very undesirable. 6 fhn 2 r?' ^ 1 ° CQlon 0 ! Merewether replied in liis letter No, 155, dated the I7tli October 1865, of which the third paragraph runs as follows :— 1 he state of ail airs now existing is nothing new. It has occurred over and over again since our occupation of Aden and will occur again unless some remedial measures are adopted. Hitherto matters have been kept smooth and temporarily set to rights by occasional presents from us (and those friendly to us who were desirous of order and quiet) given to any tnbes who threatened to or actually did disturb the peace—a mode of paying blackmail which requires little argument to prove could do no good especially where^the Chief recipient was a man of rude, hasty and violent habits, like the Padthli Chief, and one who&gt;e avarice had become a perfect passion. I should be deceiving Government were I not plainly to declare that this system now and henceforth will not even have the limited effect it has had up to the present time.” 26. As an alternative to his proposal for the establishment of a troop of 100 horsemen he suggested that a special monthly payment should be made to the Abdali Sultan for which he should hind himself to put a stop to all plunder ing, keep communications open and protect all travellers and merchants com* ing into Aden. Leaving it to the Ahdali he thought that the force necessary would he at least double that proposed for the Aden Troop. He suggested a monthly payment of Rs. 5,500 to the Sultan of Lahej which he afterwards raised to Its. 6,700. 27. He was, of course, aware that under his treaty of 1849 the Abdali Sultan was already bound to keen the roads leading to Aden clear of plundering parties and to protect all merchandise passing through his country ; punishing, if in his power, all who plundered, molested or injured others. But he had on a previous occasion, already referred to in this memo., urged that this the Sultan had neither the means nor the ability to do, 28. Major-General Sir William N. Coghlan, K.C B., lent all possible support to Colonel Merewether’s proposal. The following extracts of a letter which he wrote from London on 11th October 1865 are of particular interest:— “ I understand Lieutenant Colonel Merewether’s ultimate aim to he limited to establishment of a mounted police, whose duty shall be confined to keeping open the avenues of approach to Aden. Thus restricted in circuit and design there would be little danger of the patrols embroiling us with the tribes. Under the control indeed of the present Political Resident I do not foresee the probability of any such complications : whereas, on the other hand, I am fully convinced that the repression of violence on our borders will he followed by increased tranquillity in the Interior generally and that the security resulting therefrom will lead to a new era of prosperity among the Arabs. In that prosperity the settlement of Aden will participate largely.*’ 29. The following is also of interest :—“ I fully concur that the measures proposed, far from tending to incite the other tribes against us, would be regarded by them with satisfaction. These have latterly begun to appreciate the material benefit of commercial intercourse with Aden and of peaceful pursuits generally, and they are no less vexed than we are that those advantages should be constantly imperilled by a set of lawless marauders.” 30. Amongst the correspondence which took place at this time there is an interesting letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Merewether to the Bight Honour able Sir C. Wood, Bart., G.C.B., M.P., dated Aden, October 30th. The whole letter merits perusal, but the following extracts are of special interest. Referr ing to the state of disorder then prevailing in the Interior, he wrote : ««The consequence now is that finding the benefit to he derived from agriculture so nneertaini the inhabitants have lost all interest in it and look for means of livelihood in merely supplying wood, grass and water for the Aden market, and with the proceeds buy grain for their daily sustenance from our scanty store. Thus, instead of being a healthy support to us fhey are like a hungry parasite feeding on a living body gradually and unceasingly diminishing its strength.*’V h I 31 Referring to the Abdali, Fadthli and Subehi he wrote c&lt; A simple regular police system introduced, supported by the assistance of our friendly allies the Abdalis and bv the public announcement that plundering or acts of violence in our neighbourhood will no longer be allowed, will cause tte three tribes to settle down quietly and to abandon marauding as dangerous and unpro fitable They will then return to the more useful habits of agricultural and other peaceable pursuits Furthermore, these tribes will then form a settled and friendly barrier, a buffer in fact, between us and the more distant tribes m the hills, should the latter ever take it into their heads to be troublesome which they are not at present. ” 32. “ There would be no occasion to interfere in intertribal quarrels more than we do now. We should simply state publicly that we should not allow the roads in the immediate neighbourhood of Aden to he disturbed and that mea sures would be taken in concert with those who were desirous of peace and quiet to ensure this. This would immediately be understood as nothing more than the assumption by a powerful Government of its proper position. And punishment inflicted in such a manner would not cause the heartburning* which would inevitably follow if we attempted to bring about the same remit by employing one tribe against another. 33. “ I may also remark that I mentioned patrolling to show that it was not intended that the Horse should be kept idle and only rush forth when plun derers were said to be afoot. Iso good would come of such a course. No plun derers would ever be caught and punished. The disorder would rather be increased.'’ 84. Referring to his alternative proposal to subsidize the Abdali he wrote:— “ I confess to having no liking for it. Though pitched at the lowest possible sum, and I have great doubts whether it is not too low, it will be as costly as the Troop of Horse and not nearly so effectual. Putting tribe against tribe increases the animosity between them and tends to perpetrate the very thing we would fain put a stop to. Every time the friendly tribe had to act, it would intensify the blood feud already existing and most certainly bring about reprisals while no punishment would ever be administered sufficient to act as a deterrent for the future.” 35. This letter ended with a Postscript dated the 31st October 1865 in which Colonel Merewether wrote :—“ This is certainly a time when for every reason, on the score of policy and seif-interest, as well as humanity and justice, we should come forward and by a fitting change in management restore the people and country to the prosperity they might enjoy.” 36. India Office despatch, Political, No. 84, dated London, the 31st October 1866, contains the views expressed by the Secretary of State after full consider ation of all the opinions expressed. This commences with a reference to the operations conducted against the Fadthli Sultan by Lieutenant-Colonel Mere wether and then proceeds to a consideration of his proposal that to prevent a recurrence of similar collisions a small body of Irregular Horse or Mounted Police should he posted to Aden under the authority of the Political Resident. 37. In referring to the fear entertained by the Government of India that the location of such a force at Aden would have a tendency to embroil the British authorities there with the adjoining tribes and that in all probability it might lead eventually to requisition for a much larger force than any then in contemplation, the Secretary of State took note of Colonel Merewether s reply that he could assure Government that no person felt more strongly than he din the expediency of refraining from interference with the neighbouring tribes and abstaining from any concern with their internal quarrels and that he could confidently state from his knowledge of the people and the position that the course recommended by him was the one most likely to promote that end by avoiding the heartburnings which putting clan against clan must inevitably create. 38. He took note of the opinion expressed by the Government of India that in the event of its being necessary to entertain such a force as that under consideration it would be advisable to raise it at Aden from amongst the Arab 8 f9 C415FD riders carefully selected, weluLed and equ^ned a d 1,C l’; sem0n ' but camel commanded by a select officer of the 4 ,T PP a + w P v d m , onthl y b y U8 r ders, in preference to horsemen cothThe d lf 8U ^ 1 a bod5r oE oamel object in contemplation, it would seem to he ! n fdn?l ted a ?/' vb ? re to sec u r e the at Aden.

The Aden Troop continued on the lines originally proposed by Colonel Merewether for over 20 years. In 1867 the Resident was asked to report whether the retention of the Arab Levy attached to them was necessary—the brief correspondence on the subject is of sufficient interest to merit mention. In his letter No. 62—325, dated the 15th February 1869, the Political Resident wrote :—“ I consider that the use of the Aden Troop would be neutralized un less a portion of the Arab Levy be retained. They act as guides and assist in following up the perpetrators of deeds of plunder. They know the country and the people and with their assistance I consider that the Officer Command ing the Patrol should never be led into any acts that might embroil us with the Natives. We only wish to prevent the attacks on and plunder by thieves of the Katllas, and these Arabs of the Levy should be able to give the Officer Commanding the Patrol such information as to guide him to act against plunderers only. I would also add that the employment of men of the district in the vicinity of Aden is of the greatest value politically. 55 42. Captain Goodfellow, the Officer then Commanding the Troop, wrote in his No. 16, dated the 23rd February 1869, of the Arab Levy:—“ Parties from these bodies are continually on the move in their respective territories (Abdali and Fadthli) in both of which the Aden Troop patrols. Their duty is tocollect information regarding^ 3 ^ 000 ^ and mt^s of = fc. And as soon as they e ' information they have gained to the nearest Other evil purposes, ey y M1 immediately mounts and proceeds to J ^ •&gt; .«!; Ui.,- persons/’ the L aaily accompany the patrols of the Troop f M ^idefand bein- well acquainted with the country know where water and “r^fare procurable and are of the greatest assrstanee to my men who are unacquainted with the language of the country....... He compared them to the Belooch guides and considered their retention necessary &lt; to enable the Troop under his command to effectively perform the duties required of it. , A , A . j • * Tlie Arab Lew was accordingly retained And the correspondence is of particular interest as showing the object of their retention. It is to be observed that they were not referred to as a fighting bo y. 40 Tn the vear 1891 under Government Resolution, Military Department, No 400, dated the 21 st February 1891, the Aden Troop was re-organised. 1 ifty armed and accoutred Cameliers were substituted for as many horsemen, and the Arab Levy was reduced to one Jamedar and five sowars. The mam reasons for the change were apparently that the camel was found from practical ewerience to be more enduring and mobile in an arid ehmate and sandy soil ton the horse and that to Camelier could carry behind him to any desired point an Infantry soldier. . 4 M 44. General Hogg’s letter No. 122-1041, dated the 26th April 1890, on the strength of which the change was sanctioned, merits detailed consideration. After detailing the reasons for which to Aden Troop was originally raised he proceeded to write:-” In those days the Arab tribes in the immediate vicinity of Aden were little short of lawless free-looters, each tribe ready to lift its hand agaiMt its neighbour, and all hostile to British limits. By degrees and in he usual manner our immediate neighbours have been brought to a reasonable frame of mind. Certain tribes have been subsidized and induced thereby to carry out to some extent internal Police arrangements. These have been supplemented by an occasional judicious interference, and on all such occasions thc Aden Troop has been employed. There is no doubt that to Troop is 1 excellent order thoroughly well mounted and equipped and m a high state of training and discipline. ^ Their moral effect upon the Arab tribes is surpris- ing, and even when expeditions to to Interior have been less frequent than usual, to mere presence of the Troop at Khor Maksar has been most benefi- cial It invariablv has furnished escorts to the Political Resident and h Assistants when visiting the Interior. And the districts in which we are mostly concerned are now fairly quiet and undisturbed. « I think, therefore, that Government may certainly consider that up to t e year 1886 the good results obtained in the first place by subsidizing t e ri es and assured by the creation of the Troop have been, if regarded as a matter ot Police administration, economical. Since the occupation of Berbera, ±5u and Zi-ila the troop has been employed on the Somali Coast and owing o comparatively undisturbed state of the Arab tribes near Aden this has Been feasible. Experience of the last three years has, however, shown that the present constitution of the Troop which is certainly costly is not that best s for the work now required of it. And it is evident that a Troop organize different and less expensive lines would suffice. It is, therefore, propose reduce the number of sowars mounted as horsemen and to substitute am Sowars and to reduce the Arab Levy, retaining only six men as guides-m to remodel the Troop with a view to getting a body of soldiers adopted tor wor* in Arabia and on the Somali Coast, if necessary.” “The Arab Levy to be abolished retaining one Jamedar and five of tie best men as guides: no more are now required. The Levy has been ton during the late Essa expedition to be not a fighting body and they are J means amenable to discipline. We want as many men as possible tr 1011 oUliers specially amenable to discipline and their weapons/’ highly trained in the use of „ ,, n rhe “ t, ' er c,l,ef P^Posals are as followsThe camels to hare IMit double mounted 0 m ''T f Urgent o 60688 *^ 50 infantry or other men can be * a ^ he ^roat advantages of this are obvious. And the arrangement will render the Troop a much more powerful body than at present.” “ ,, 45. r J he Pwecords of the Aden Residency show that Colonel E. Y. Stace, t vc Jjirst Assistant to the Resident at the time, felt strongly on the subiect of the comparative uselessness of horsemen in an arid country where water was scarce and suitable forage for horses difficult to obtain. Both on the Somali Coast and at Am Rija in the Aden Hinterland he had personally experienced the inconvenience arising from these difficulties. 46. With reference to the change effected it is, I think, to he remarked that it was apparently mainly the outcome of experiences in Somaliland and lurthermore of making a different use of the Troop to that for which it was originally laisecl. The constant patrolling of earlier years was evidently a thing of the past, and fighting was substituted as the main object in view. The Arab Levy pronounced so essential by former officers to render the Troop really efficient and so valuable for political reasons was by a stroke of the pen reduced, because in the Essa expedition they had not been found a fighting body and had been found somewhat lax of discipline. Probably under similar circumstances similar complaints might have arisen of Belooeh scouts. 47. It may further, I think, be remarked that the comparatively undis turbed state of the country which rendered it feasible for the Aden Troop to be sent to Somaliland, Egypt and Abyssinia was very largely the outcome of the excellent use to which the Aden Troop had up to that time been put in accordance with its original object : which, it may be observed, was rather to prevent fighting than to fight. 48. It may be that Cameliers are better adopted to the needs of the Aden Protectorate than horsemen. In former days eminent opinion favoured the horsmen. It would seem possible that the Arab, himself an excellent Camelier, may not inconceivably regard with less fear and respect an opposing body of Cameliers than a well-equipped body of Horsemen. 49. As to the reduction of the Arab Levy it seems open to question whether this was not a political mistake and also whether it has not impaired the usefulness of the Aden Troop for purely local purposes. 50. When Sheikh Othman was purchased in 1582 a small body of Arab Police mounted on camels was raised for patrolling purposes. This consisted of 1 Jamedar, 2 Havildars and 12 men only, who were placed under the exclusive control of the Assistant Resident in charge Sheikh Othman and were called upon to furnish posts at Sheikh Othman, Imad, Bir Jabal, Hiswa and little Aden. They were also called upon to furnish three orderlies, one for the First Assistant Resident, one for the Officer in charge Sheikh Othman and one for the Post. 51. In 1891 some correspondence took place regarding this small body, which apparently had become rather mixed up with the ordinary Foot Police of the Settlement and not treated as the separate body which it w T as apparently originally intended that they should be. The correspondence arose owing to some outrage committed at Sheikh Othman by the Subehi. And it is interest ing to observe that the Aden Troop was then called upon to resume its old duty of patrolling the roads and that the orders issued to the Troop included the following words:— “ An Arab guide will always accompany the Patrol. ,, 52. But this measure was only spasmodic. And arrangements were made for the Aden Troop patrol to be withdrawn and relieved by a patrol of the small body of Sheikh Othman Mounted Police. The orders then issued by order of the Political Resident are of interest:— “The Mounted Police are to be a separate body under the exclusive control of the Assistent Resident in charge Sheikh Othman and are to beused for Patrol duties (not in the Town), the protection of the Frontier and pursuit of thieves and other offenders. They will be under their own Jamedar, who should be an active and intelligent officer. It is to be understood that their patrol duties will chiefly be outside^ the Frontier and especially in the very early mornings. They may, as occasion requires, patrol towards Khor Maksar and from there towards Abyan. 1 * 53. I observe with interest that SHEIKH OTHMAN DIVISION DETAILS. in a Memorandum dated the 15th August 1891 Colonel Stace re marked that the abolition Mounted Police. The Mounted Police are a separate body under the exclusive control of the Officer in charge sheikh Othman and are used for Patrol duties, the protection of the frontier, and pnrsuit of thieres and other offenders. They are under their own Jainedar. Their pitrol duties are chiefly outside the frontier and, as occasion requires, towards Khor Maksar and A by an. They are detailed for work as follows Mounted Police. of the Arab Levy rendered this patrolling more ne cessary than ever. The correction to Aden Police Hand Book,dated the Srd September 189L, shows the distribution of this small body of 15 men, and one cannot hut be struck by the fact that the net result of this corres pondence was to impose- upon 15th indiscipliued, badly trained and badly armed Arabs, the very duties for which the Aden Troop had been originally raised and to relegate the Aden Troop to the position of a mere fighting unit of the Aden garrison in which terms I observe that General Maitland also referred to it in 1901. He added in the same note, however, that it was at the disposal of the Political Resident and that all orders regarding movements should be sent to the Officer Commanding Troop by the First Assistant Resident as theretofore.

The general position may thus be said to have changed as follows:— The patrolling duties for which the Aden Troop was originally raised have devolved upon a small and an insufficient body of Arab Camelmen. The Aden r! 15 b ecome a unit of the garrison at the special control of the Political Resident. It occasionally furnishes escorts to celebrities in Aden. It furnishes an escort to the Political Officer at Dtbala and to the Political Resi dent and his Assistants when on tour in the Hinterland. It is available for military operations in the Hinterland. ■\ir ^ interesting to here recall the actual words of Lieutenant Colonel j erevve er :-— l hey would not be suddenly sent here and there harassing en ?^ e . ves disordering the country, but a regular quiet system of patrolling would be established and plunderers at once captured or punished on the spot. Besides which an orderly body of men carrying with them unmistakable s reng i^ moving about the country would instil confidence into the people.” ^nd again, I mentioned patrolling to show that it was not intended that the orse should be kept idle and only rush forth when plunderers were said to be a .°?

His proposal has not been given effect to, and ere again it is of interest to notice that his proposals gave rise to very similar tears on the part of Government to those produced by Colonel Merewether’s proposals 40 years before. . 12C415FD 67. At the present moment another proposal isunder the consideratien nf Government concerning the partial assumption of jurisdiction within the Pro- Arab LevTat V? . desira 1 blllt - v ot es'ablisMng various posts and patrols of an Arab Levy at various places on the roads with a view to the preservation of order WOR « Th T ° 1-6 Maj0 , r .f C0b ’ S Mem &lt;»-™dum dated the 21st January » 9 w ‘ i T ,i n una ; ded P ol . i&lt;!e lds roads.

Where, however, such tribal disturb ances bring insecurity to the caravan route, the matter demands our attention and action, ihe past policy of alternate inaction and vengeance may he rele gated to a dead past. ” J 58. In the same memorandum he writes “ I would propose to replace my present escort of 20 Aden Troopers under a Jamedar by an equal number of Arabs, all picked men. I have nothing against the Aden Troopers who have a distinct role in the Hinterland, but believe my work will he rendered easier in every way by this change. These would be mounted so as to move with me in the districts.” 59. He also writes “ Later the Levy idea might he enlarged so as to include posts beyond the trade lines, but leading into them as conduits of com merce” and in conclusion “ I would urge upon Government the advisabilitv of close consideration of the vast potentialities this enlargement of my present proposal offers and which, far more successfully than the grant to a few of stipends, solves the problem of how economically and in return for work rendered to settle the entire country-side and win over a democracy to its re cognized heads.” 60. Before this Memorandum was drafted, Colonel Scallon had already addressed Government on the subject in his letter No. 6269, dated the 15th October 1905, where he wrote “ 1 need not add that the proposed assumption of jurisdiction should include the raising of a regular and carefully recruited tribal levy to police the trade routes and more important districts of the Protectorate. But this I consider absolutely essential to the peace and pro gress of the country even in the absence of special jurisdictional arrangement.” 61. The concluding paragraph of this letter is also worthy of quotation “ To conclude I would remark that I am strongly of opinion that it is now full time that more law and order were introduced within the limits of our Protectorate, hut that in the case of the Abdali Sultan and of, perhaps, one or two other Chiefs, 1 am inclined to think it preferable to secure this by Treaty and special extradition arrangements rather than by direct assumption of authority. As to the Subehi, Yafai and other sub-divided tribes where there is no real central authority, I consider it preferable that we should now gradu ally but firmly ourselves interfere to effect order, secure peace and promote trade.' 62. In regard to these more recent proposals one or two remarks seem called for. The terms of Major Jacob’s reference to past policy as one of alternate inaction and vengeance can certainly not be fairly applied to the policy portrayed by Lieutenant-Colonel Merewether in 1865 and admitted by General Hogg to have been successfully carried out up to 1886. Colonel Merewether’s policy was by constant activity to avoid the necessity for venge ance altogether. 63. Again, it is questionable whether any Arab Levy would really prove efficient as a fighting body, as a body directly charged with the duty of preserv ing order. The Arab Levy attached to the Aden Troop was reduced owing to its lack of fighting qualities and also of amenability to discipline. The Sheikh Othman Mounted Police cannot be said to he a body of proved efficiency. A short time a^o one of the Sowars shot his superior officer dead. Colonel Stace wrote in 1891 that they have never acted vigorously when required. And this is an opinion which at the present day I am prepared to endorse. Again, where punishment did prove necessary it may be doubted whether an Arabun —« ™ r —a- « deterrent.

Further, in the recent revolt against Ottoman rule appear that large forces of regular troops have been required to effectually overcome a resistance of a more or less fanatical nature. fi powerf they have also closely studied the reluctance with which we make use of it. They have noticed with interest the result of our campaign again Somaliland Mullah on the opposite coast. also be remarked that though the Arabs have learnt our 70. They have further learnt not only our power hut our wealth. It is only a few months ago that the Abdali Sultan himself frankly compared the British Government to a lump of ambergris thrown up upon the snor to derive what benefit they could from. 71 It is also to he remarked that for certain commodities, such as grass, wood and vegetables, the main Settlement is still larply dependent upon caravan trade In 1904 I have a personal recollection of the high price of glass nearly driving the local public carriage owmers out on strike.

On the other hand, the Fadthli has been debarred ► from this source ot profit and feels the loss keenly. The Subehi also bitterly complain of the prohibition in this matter imposed upon them. The Kotaibi and Kadfan tribes regard with jealous envy the benefit derived by others and denied to them It is, as it was in 1865, to the benefit of some that order should be maintained, but to others disorder still presents greater attractions and the chance ot extorting mere blackmail. 73. In the Subehi country it must be admitted generally that there has been very little change for the better since Colonel Merewether first described them as a people reduced to poverty and much given to plundering in small parties. _ On the roads passing through the Subehi country there is still a lack of security. Depredations are fairly frequent. The life of a European is not safe. Whilst the matches are not constantly alight on the matchlocks, the finder is always on the trigger. Men go about armed. The petty Chiefs are engaged in constant feuds The crops raised are scanty. The general position is most derogatory to the great power which claims to protect the district. Presents are still given to any tribe who threatens to or actually does disturb the peace. Instead of attending to agriculture and other peaceful pursuits men prefer to come in the guise of somewhat violent beggars to the great British Government Of the Subehi it may still be said that “ instead of being a healthy support to us they are like a hungry parasite feeding on a living body.” 74. The Abdali have been pitted against them. The experiment has not only failed, but has been the cause of heartburnings and reprisals which to the present day frequently disturb the peace of the country. 75. In their despatch to the Government of India No. 219, dated the 12th January 1904, the Bombay Government referred to the principle of tribal responsibility coupled with a minimum of British interference as their tradi tional policy. It is a policy of which Colonel Merewether urged the inadequacy. It is a policy which the present condition of the Subehi country proves not to have been a success. It is a policy which in their despatch No. 130 of 1904 the Government of India themselves refer to as having been not altogether successful. There they wrote in paragraph 4, 44 Despite the considerable stipends which we have paid to the Chiefs, order has not been preserved ; outrages have disturbed the security of the trade routes; our officers have been unable to enter tribal territory without a stronger escort or heavy payment for the right of passage; and we have had to remain in that ignorance of tribal affairs which have been such a severe handicap throughout the recent delimitation proceed ings.*’ In the same despatch they wrote, “ The policy of non-interference in the affairs of the Hinterland has resulted, as the Reports of the Boundary Commission show, in a serious loss of territory to the tribes. And the ignorance of the true tribal border which this policy involved is probably responsible for the establishment of a Turkish post at Sheikh Said.” 75a. In a previous despatch No. 46T E.A., dated the 10th February 1904* the Government of India wrote : “ The Government of India consider that they are not only entitled but are called upon, in view of the expense and trouble which have been incurred in securing the Amir of Dthala against violation of his territories, to insist upon a greater immunity to the caravan routes passing though Amiri territory between the interior and Aden.” 76. There is more which might be urged against the policy of non-inter ference which was found no more a success in India than it has been in Arabia, which may at any time lead to international complications with the neighbour ing Ottoman Government, aad which on the score of policy and self-interest as well as of humanity and justice is open to much criticism. 77. 'When Major Jacob states that the Amir of Dthala cannot ^ unaided police his roads, he is stating a fact of which the truth is, to the Officer in chargeof British interests on the spot, apparent. Granted that it is to be desired that or. dfiusu mteiosta ij unaided and alone, he cannot do so now- some day the Amir should sia _ recosnise a single head and take to granted that the Subehi may some cL 5 VP f Granted that fends neieeful and orderly pursuits, they have not done so yet.

Granted that agriculture in our Protectorate has great possibihtes, theie are still many barren tracts. f LUOtU-J 78 In brief, our task in South-Western Arabia is still not completed. When Lord Cornwallis in 1805 so strongly advocated the policy of non- interference in India he miscalculated the conditions of Asiatic Society and ov erlooked the consideration that Empires must res on moral founda ions. Sir John Malcolm’s views were clearly more sound when he wrote: “We must alike avoid the minute and vexatious interference which lessens their nower and utility and that more baneful course which satisfied with their fulfilling the general conditions of their alliance gives a blind support to their authority, however ruinous its measures to the prosperity of the country and the happiness of its inhabitants. 79 In South-Western Arabia there are portions of the Protectorate where there is’ practically no regular authority and where even t l ® ,f c “ era j C ^ “f,! of the treaties entered into with nommal rulers are not fulfilled I* such ds of the treaties entered into wiiu ij.uiuiu.ai ^ ^ tricts there is and has been for years past a necessity for some strong power to intervene. In other portions of the Protectorate it would_ also be politic to very Gradually but firmly exercise that influence which has in India had such unique and marvellous results. The present condition of the Aden Protec torate is no worse than was the condition of the province of Kathiawar a com paratively few years ago. Kathiawar is to-day one of the most settled an well-administered districts of the Indian Empiie. 80. In his letter No. 72, dated the 24th March 1904, General Maitland dwelt upon the differences existing between the boundary of the Ad n ■ tectorate and that of Afghanistan. He compared the Protectorate to the Punjab. I have above compared it to Kathiawar. 81 Now that our boundary has been demarcated we are gradually hut surelv coming into closer touch with more distant tribes and more than ever is it desirable, or rather necessary, that our^ immediate neighbours should h^ friendly and useful. At this moment there is no single State of the P torate, with the exception perhaps of the single Township of Moka , &gt; . there can be said to he anything in the form of a regmar Police or re 0 forces of any kind. 82. It is time that measures were taken to encourage more regular and effective arrangements for the preservation of the peace and older in e • And in districts where there is no central authority capable of effectin, sue measures it behoves us to ourselves intervene. 83. It was as long ago as the 5 th January 1865 that the Goyernmen Bombay wrote in their despatch No. 30 that “it was not our business o one tribe in attacking another, especially when the tribe attacked was a P with us. ” I would urge that it is our business to now more ful ]y un(1 ° r f * the moral and general responsibilities for that peace and progress ci ® C01 J which we have now finally taken upon ourselves to demarcate as part oi inn Empire, and not part of the Ottoman Empire. 8 ‘,. On the other side of the border in Ottoman territory we have lately seen the display of a fixed determination to effectually interfere m t e j en administration* of the district. Revenue has for years past been collected a more or less effective administration has been dir ectly exercised.85. I am far from advocating Turkish methods of administration or so direct an interference in tribal affairs as that exercised by them. I would simply advocate a pursuance in S.*W. Arabia of those methods which in the Punjab and in Kafniawar have had so beneficial an effect. I would merely repeat the words of Lieut.-Colonel Mere wether that “ This is certainly a time when for every reason, on the score of policy and self-interest as well as humanity and justice, we should come forward and by a fitting change in management restore the people and country to the prosperity they might enjoy.*’ 86. With this in view I would specifically recommend that in the Subehi country and in the less settled portions of the Protectorate in the vicinity of Aden, the Aden Troop should resume their old activity. 1 would recommend that their old constitution should be restored and that the Sheikh Othman Police should be incorporated as the Arab Levy of former days. The force should be kept up to sufficient strength to cope with our increasing responsi bilities. It should still continue a special weapon at the particular disposal of the Political authorities. It should be rather of the nature of the Kathiawar Agency Police than an integral portion of the ordinary garrison. It should be kept in a high state of efficiency, but as little trammelled as possible with the routine parades and exercises of more regular Cavalry. Above all the Troop should never be “ idle in their lines.” 87. Together with this the more powerful Chiefs should gradually and firmly be encouraged to put their own forces on a more regular footing and to discharge their own responsibilities more effectively within the limits of their own States. 88. Measures should be taken to more precisely define those limits. Extradition arrangement should be put on a more satisfactory footing. It should be understood that the British Government is paramount and that the fiat has at last gone forth that there shall be order in the^ land and that the labourer shall enjoy the fair fruits of his labour. Excessive imposts on the transit of goods should be gradually removed and taxation restricted to more legitimate channels. 89. Granted that, as the Abdali Sultan remarks, the British Government is a lump of ambergris cast up by the waves upon the shores of Arabia for all to derive what benefit they can from, I would urge that those benefits should be peace and progress, civilization and development rather than the inert distribution of largesses to an avaricious and improvident people, many of whom are still bred up in a state of ignorance of all the principles of orderly Government.

From-MAJOR-GENiRAL H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To The Chief Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay. lav 1 ^ ave Aden 1 think it advisable that I should Aden t f Government regarding the substitution of levies for the ant /Lr?™ th h0T10I ! r ^ 0 .r eqU S st that the notes submitted by my Eirst Assist- ant (durmg my recent v^t to Bombay) on the Aden Troop may be treated frrvTiTo / P P® n ^ lx to ^ \ etter &gt; as !t gi v es a history of the organization of the troop (which may be interesting to Government), together with his own views with which I do not agree, as will be seen from what follows. 2. The times and general condition of the country when the Aden Troop was organized and the present are totally different. The tribes on the lines ^mumcation to D thala are well behaved and quiet. A certain amount o msignmcant looting takes place, which would happen in any similar frontier district, and although the question might be raised that those tribes off the Imes of communication, viz., Yaffai, Subaihis, Kotaibis and others, are not yet m sufficient touch with us to prove their friendliness, still I maintain that this might be brought about by the establishment of levies, composed of the different tribes, which would enable the Political Officer to visit the tribes himself and thus bring about a better understanding. In this opinion Major Jacob, Politi cal Officer at D thala, thoroughly agrees, and he has stated to me how far preferably he would go amongst these tribes with an escort thus composed than be accompanied by the Aden Troop, since the latter, though Mahomedans, are far different from the indigenous Arab and their presence would without doubt not be as effective as that of the other. 3. It will be seen therefore that I am of opinion that much might be done towards the pacification of the country by the substitution of a levv for the Aden Troop. 4. Its composition I would propose as follows:— “ A couple of hundred men to compose the levy with a British Inspect ing Officer who would visit the various posts and be held responsible for the training and discipline of the men. Of this number 50 might be main tained by the Amir of D’thala, 100 at Suleik by the Kotaibi, and 50 at Nobat Dakim by the Sultan of Lahej.” 5. I would also advocate 12 men of the Aden Troop with two non-commis sioned officers being retained at Khor Maksar, Aden, or elsewhere, who would be the immediate guard of the Inspecting Officer. These men would also be able to furnish the small escorts necessary for official visits to Aden. 6. The advantages of such a levy are many— First, I consider that without a doubt such a levy would lead still more to the pacification of the country, for they would enable the Political Officer to visit the tribes without causing suspicion, which at the present he cannot altogether do when accompanied by an escort of the Aden Troop. Second, the cost to Government of the raising of such a levy would, be, I take it, less than half that now expended on the upkeep of the Aden Troop ; whilst a considerable sum of money would go directly to the tribes, who would fully appreciate this advantage. 7. At a rough calculation the pay list of the Aden Troop shows an annual expenditure of some Us. 90,000 ; to this must be added the expense of sea90 makadpam^8£ocmfln pr^^g^m'ou?h,the^e ^ ^ nQt ^ ’^sT£sus^r«, Urn** &lt;r* “ ' &lt;i A1 ““ *“ propose shortly to abolish. ^ ^ ^ as j propose, 8.

The present quarters were provided by and are the property of the troop. The most recent regulations allow 30 quarters to be provided by Military Works. To provide these according to approved type plan, of stone, would probably cost Rs. 22,500. It is considered that a more kutcba form of construction, say, poles, reeds plastered and thatched roof, would be much better suited to the climate and would cost much less, but if this is adopted the lines should be provided and kept in repair by the Troop. A grant being made as to Native Indian Regiments. The initial grant should be larger than usually given owing to the cost of building in Aden. 4 It would be very difficult for the Military Works to keep buildings occupied by troops in proper repair. The troop should also have 10 quarters for 10 followers which have not been provided- cost if of stone, say, Rs. 5,000. These also I should recommend be of more kutcha construc tion built and kept in repair by the troop. Expenditure on Bepairs. The actual expenditure on repairs in five years has been Rs. 11,019—an average of Rs. 2,201 a year. During the past five years Re. 961 has also been spent on new works. (Signed) R.

Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Chief Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay. In conjunction with my letter No. 1481, dated 11th instant, embodying iny proposals for the raising of local levies to ultimately replace the Aden Troop, I would suggest that the Military authorities be approached with a view to the retention of Captain Parsons’ services for a further term of one year beyond his normal tenure which expires in June. Captain Parsons has an intimate know ledge of the interior economy of the troop as at present constituted, and it would be most advisable to have an officer of this experience in the winding up of the affairs of the said troop. I only make this proposal on the assumption that my i eas with reference to local levies meet with the favourable considera tion of Government. P. D. letter No. 2937, dated the 18th April 1906. From—The Chief Secretary to Government, Bombay, To—The Political Resident, Aden. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of General Mason’s letters No. 1481, dated the 11th March 1906, and No. 1485, of the same date, on the sub ject of the policy to be adopted in future in regard to the Aden Troop and the enrolment of levies. 2. I am to say that His Excellency the Governor in Council does not con sider the time very opportune for the consideration of such changes. The policy favoured by His Majesty’s Secretary of State is not one of activity in the Hinterland, but one of allowing the greatest measure of independence to the tribes consistent with our own interests and our obligations to the Turks. 3. There have been placed before Government proposals made by Captain Hancock, proposals made by General Mason and proposals made by Major Jacob. Both the former sets of proposals involve taking steps which it would he very difficult to retrace, if the policy on which they are based should not be approved, or should not give the results anticipated for it. But so far as regards Major Jacob’s proposals, it is possible to test the proposals to some extent, meeting the expenditure involved by way of presents from that officer’s discre tionary grant to the tribes who supply the men. If it should appear to you desirable to test his scheme before further reporting to Government, there will be no objection to the establishment of one or gradually more posts in this way in order to test the expectations on which the schemes are founded. The expenditure involved in such experiment should of course be kept as low as pos sible, and should he carried out in such a way as neither to alarm the susceptibi lities of the tribes as to interference in the Hinterland, nor to weaken our pre sent resources should the experiment not prove successful. 4. In these circumstances, His Excellency the Governor in Council does not propose to take any measures to procure the extension of Captain Parsons term of command with a view to winding up the affairs of the Aden Troop. Proposals regarding the abolition of the Aden Troop and the employment of tribal levies for safeguarding the trade routes to Aden. No. 8419, dated the 9th June 1906. From-MAJOR-GENEUAL E. DeBrath, C.B., C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident, Aden, To—The Chief Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay. In reply to your letter No. 2937, dated 18th April 1908, regarding the policy to he adopted in future as regards the Aden Troop and the enrolment of tribal levies, I hare the honour to state that paragraph 2 of your letter, indi cating the policy of His Majesty’s Secretary of State, has been noted for guidance.2. The several proposals made by Captain Hancock, General Mason and Major Jacob, referred to in paragraph 3 of your letter, with regard to the replacement of the Aden Troop by tribal levies and the restoration to the Aden Troop of the duties for which they were originally raised, have for their object the safeguarding of the caravan route and the punishment of those who disturb the peace of the country. But while we are anxious to abstain from interference with the tribes, and consequently desire to attain our objects through the Chiefs J themselves, we hesitate, as it seems to me, to admit that they either will not ' or cannot, with the means at their disposal, so control their petty Sheikhs and tribesmen as to enable them to fulfil their treaty engagements, chief of which is the security of the roads which traverse their territory. In return for the stipends that we regularly pay to the Chiefs we receive little beyond their good will, and, unless we are prepared to considerably increase these stipends, which are not at present sufficient to pay for the necessary levies, and also insist on the money being utilized in the maintenance of efficient levies and patrols on the trade routes, we cannot, it seems to me, ensure our object. Now it must, I think, be recognized that to insist on the maintenance by the Chiefs of efficient levies would involve some interference, but to a lesser decree than maintaining those levies for ourselves. But, on the other hand, as our control over them would be indirect, the tribal levies would under their own Chiefs be perhaps less efficient. 3. I am greatly averse to any proposal which involves the disbandment of the Aden Troop. With a slight modification in its organization, by which the Arab guides of former days would again be incorporated in the troop, I believe its utility might be greatly increased, and I propose to address you separately on this subject at a later date. Tn the event of the Arab levies proving inefficient, it may be a matter for consideration whether the Aden Troop should not he charged with the security of the entire road to D’thala. In addition to these duties they must act as escort to the Resident and to the Political Officer, whom it is proposed to appoint to the Southern Division, and thus enable him to visit any part of the Subehi country when required. 4. If this be agreed to, there remains only that part of the road that traverses Haushabi, Alawi, Kotaibi and Amiri limits. We have already arranged to pay the Amir an increased stipend with the special object of keeping up 50 levies who will be charged with the safety of the road through Amiri territory. In my opinion a similar obligation should be imposed on the Haushabi, Alawi and Kotaibi. The last named is subject to the Amir, however, and although the latter is responsible, I see no objection to increasing the Amir’s stipend by a sum of Rs. 50 a month as proposed by Major Jacob, which shall be directly earmarked for the Kotaibi Chief. It should be given however for the express purpose of safeguarding the road and should cease as soon as that object is not attained. 5. As to the Haushabi Sultan, he has a considerable stretch of road to safeguard, which is open to attack by the Dthambaries and Subehis. He has moreover to safeguard the Mavia caravan road. I think he should be given some further assistance. He requires to maintain 50 men to do the work that falls to him effectively. I propose that troops be withdrawn from the post of El-Millah where they serve no useful purpose, and that the Haushabi Sultan be given 50 M.-H. rifles and 1,000 rounds of ammunition and that his stipend be increased by Rs. 50 as a contribution towards cost of these 50 men. This payment to cease at once if he fails to keep the road secure. 6. There remains the Alawi who gets a stipend of Rs. 50 a month. I consider that this amount is an inadequate recognition of his responsibilities, and I recommend that it be doubled, on condition that he maintains 20 efficient men at Mabaja or elsewhere. The grant in this case also should be contingent on the safety of the road being maintained. 24* a . bo 7® leYies should be open to inspection by the Political Agent, 1) thala, m the same manner as the levies maintained for a like purpose oy the Amir. I may add that I have ascertained without making any definite promises that the Chiefs concerned are ready to co-operate to the extent ,1 8 * * n( ? e m P ara S ra pb 3 of your letter under reply you propose that tne cost of such levies as may he required should he met from the grant for JJarbar presents. This would perhaps hardly he a convenient way of meeting the cost of increased stipends now proposed, hut I would suggest that if it he thought necessary, the grant for Darbar presents he reduced and the grant for stipends he increased by the amount of extra expenditure now proposed, viz., Ks. 1,800 per annum.

I am not myself in favour of attempting to bolster up a ruler whom I regard as weak and avaricious, but as it may possibly be necessary to ask for orders by telegram, I forward these papers so that Government may be fully acquainted with the details of the case. Nasar, son of Amir Shaif, has just called. He says his men went to arrest the criminal of whom the Kaimmakam Kataba wrote to me and charged of having murdered a Turkish subject. In the discharge of their duty, the upstart Mukbil Najilof Jibal Jehaf (who has been of late consistently opposing the Amiris rule and authority on that Hill and has been proclaimed by the people there as their Sheikh) appeared on the scene with a following to withstand the Amir. The Amir will take neces sary action but is busy just now devising a scheme whereby to preclude the Shairi tribe from assisting the Jibal Jehafis. If the Amir’s diplomacy turns out unsuccessful he will be obliged, ^ he savs to adopt coercive measures.

I am fully aware the support then approved was to be moral in kind. 3 New times demand new measures. If therefore, the Amir s eonditiou should became really parlous-and not till then-and he expressly apply for aid I request I may be given discretionary power to intervene. From my two years'experience of, and close attention to, Hinterland affairs, I am confident that an unequivocal declaration of the determination of Government, in the per on of their local representative, to assure the supremacy of the Amir, ?'&gt;. w Ln threatened, will suffice to turn the scales in the Amir s favour. ► ILLltW UlsW ; It is not a personal Amir we want to uphold, but the principle of the authority of His House : otherwise, our sojourn m these parts will have nothing to command it-rather, will have been mischievous m its effect.

Annexure ,f A ” to Memo. No. 1330, dated the 5th December 1906. The Kaimmakam of Kataba has accused a subject of the Amir of Dthala, living in Hazat al ’Abid and close to the frontier, of the murder of a lurkish subject. He has written to me and called for reparation, as, failing this, iresh incidents must occur to mar the security of the border. 2. I have pressed the Amir to give early reparation, and this he has undertaken to give, but uses the occasion to remind ^me of the many unsettled claims he has made through me against Turkish subjects. 8. These claims X have duly forwarded to Kataha for settlement and report, hut owing, in the main, to repeated changes of Kaimmakams and also to the chaotic state of the country across the border, because of the fend with the Iman, it has been left to the present incumbent, an Arab of promise, to afford satisfaction, which indeed he has engaged to do. 4. I have assured the Kaimmakam, Kataha, of the Amir’s determina tion to decide “ the Haza affair ” in terms of Arab custom, approved on both sides the line, hut have invited his attention to the early settlement of the Amir’s long outstanding grievances. I will report later the progress made. H. F. JACOB, Major, Political Agent, Dthala. No. 7334, dated Aden Residency, the 9th December 1906 (Confidential). From— Captain F. DeB.

With reference to your memorandum No. 1330, dated the 4th. instant and Annexure A, dated the 6th idem, regarding the difficulties experienced y eAmir of Dthala in effecting the arrest of a criminal who is alleged to have recently murdered a T urkish subject in the vicinity of the frontier, I am to request that copies of the communications which you have received on the subject from the Kaimmakam of Kataha maybe submitted for the orders of the Political Resident. 2. In this connection, I am to invite your attention to recent corres pondence regarding the extradition of fugitive criminals, and to add that if in the present case the Kaimmakam’s request is limited to an expression of his desire that the Amir of Dthala should himself dispense justice, a copy of his complaint should nevertheless be submitted in the hrst place for the orders of the Resident. 3. Meanwhile I am to state that if an attempt to effect the immediate arrest of the criminal is in your opinion really likely to seriously imperil the Amii s position such a course should not be unduly insisted upon pending reference of the matter to Government. It is understood that many counter-claims exist against the Turkish authorities of Kataba, the settlement of which has been from time to time deferred. And I am to request that a summary of these may accompany your further report on the present claim. 4. I am to add that pending further orders your own intervention in the affair should he limited to giving such advice to the Amir of Dthala and to his tribesmen as may tend to the establishment of better relations between them and to the avoidance of further complications. //.

No. 8734, dated Bbmhay Castle, the 22nd December 1906. From H. O. Quin, Esq., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Incontinuationofmy letter No. 7637, dated the 10th November 1906, I am directed to forward herewith, for the orders of the Government of India, copy of a letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 7487, dated the 16th 9(ii) on the period within which it would be possible to collect supplies and transport in Aden for the relief of the escort should such a step become necessary. 2. I have not yet been consulted in regard to the advisabilty of retaining the Political Agent at Dthala as a femjoorar’y measure, after the withdrawal of the garrison. As it is impossible satisfactorily to compress within the limits of a telegram the reasons which led me to despatch my secret telegram dated 10th December, I take this opportunity of expressing my opinion on the matter so that the Government of India may be under no misapprehension as to what I believe to be the real state of the case. 3. Whatever we may wish to believe there is, I think, no doubt that the rule of the Amir of Dthala is, by reason of his weakness and avarice, unpopular with a large number of the tribesmen over whom he claims control. And in consequence beholds his position mainly by reason of the support afforded to him by British bayonets. The Arabs of the Hinterland do not want us there, and the Amir of Dthala only tolerates our presence so long as he requires our support against the Turks or against his recalcitrant tribesmen. Were he in a position to stand alone he would welcome our departure to-morrow. He has personally and plainly given me to understand this. By the other Chiefs and Sheikhs our presence is tolerated in consideration of the blackmail which we allow them to levy from us. The Abdali Sultan alone appears to me to appreciate in some measure the blessings of the and this is largely due to the fact that his subjects are not sufficiently warlike to hold their own against their neighbours. 4, No purely temporary retention of the Political Agent in Dthala will remove the causes of the Amir's unpopularity, nor can the former hope, in the , course of a few mouths, to do what we have undoubtedly lailcd to accomplish during the past three years, viz., to consolidate the Amir’s power and render effective the control he claims over certain sections of his tribesmen such as the Sliairis, Kotaibis and Jibafis. The most that the Political Agent can hope to effect is by the offer of good advice to render the Amir more cautions, forbear- in' and moderate than be might otherwise he, and possibly Ins tribesmen mi'ht be induced to be less refractory for the moment. ^ Such loss of prestige as undoubtedly attaches to our withdrawal from the hinterland will not, in my opinion, he lessened by a merely temporary stay of our Political Officer at jHhala On the other baud I regard the retention of a small body of troops (which'will not greatly exceed 100 effective bayonets) in Dthala as not altogether free from objection on military grounds Even though not actively employed in the support of the Amirs authority, we cannot permit tribal fiXnf close to our camp. It will therefore be impossible m practice for the Political Agent to avoid acting as mediator and he will be obliged peisonally to intervene to stop or prevent the outbreak of hostilities In such circum- stances it is quite conceivable that the escort might be called upon to defend itself either against the tribes or the Amir’s troops. 5 Assuming however that Government decide on retaining the Political Agent temporarily in Dthala with the escort I proposed m my telegram dated fifth December 1906,1 consider the distribution should be as follows . In Dthala —135 bayonets, 2 Maxims, 20 sabres, Aden Troop. In Dthubaiyat —15 bayonets all ranks. In Suleik —75 bayonets all ranks. In Nobat Dakim—lb bayonets all ranks. ^ # Owing to the difficulty of commufficatfon’ 0 auTtop °tbe road open by and in order to control the line o£ ‘° alsoto avoid tte necessity for sending patrolling with Mounted Infantry &gt; and treasure convoys, I consider it up a Strong escort with the regpl 11 J 0ur aball donment of necessary to continue to hold iNobat vaSuleik is quite likely to give rise to trouble between the Kotaibis and Alawis, so I should prefer to retain it so long as we are in Dtkala. 6 I may now consider the sufficiency of the escort which I propose should i.VS ri flp, o machine guns and, for the present, 20 sabres Aden Troop, consist of loo r ’ , , f orce w ith which one might be obliged to deal in _ it is not easy to forecast the ^ ^ 500 rifle ^ en is probably a fairly f XHhala at ^ortnoUce, but I oonsrder 40^ ^ retention of the l two ^ o£ ^ » liberal approxi ^ ^ ^ ^ temptation to use them, as we have already dorm \Residency No. 5039, dated the 24th August 1906) and being manned by European gunners they greatly increase the difficu ties of supply The Maxim guns on the other hand are more than the equivalent of another 50 Infan ry fnd should be retained.

The collection of carriage and supplies would take possibly hve days and the march up, which, on account of water difficulties, must be performed in two detachments, would require six days more. &amp; &lt;= - T ^ am No _ g , 214i aated the 31 st December 1906.

In these circum stances Government of India are precluded from recommending active intervention in support of Amir against his refractory tribesmen. Pending further instructions about which Secretary of State is being addiessed, Political Officer should, therefore, confine himself to using his good offices with local Turkish officials to prevent the Shairi from being supported by men from over the border and should tell the Amir that we cannot assist him with troops m his quarrel with his tribes under present conditions.

I attach for the perusal of the Resident a curious “ Notice *’ to hand from Muhammad Saleh, the Kotaibi Sheikh. 2. It is the result of news of our intended evacuation and the non-receipt by this Sheikh of what he considers his dues, after our attempt rapprochement which the pacification of the country demanded. 3. The letter at first sight reads like an open defiance and hints at what the Kotaibis will feel bound to do when our backs are turned, i.e. x begin the old game of taking their road dues. This was the origin of our trouble with them. I have not replied to the missive. 4. Suleik Fort, as I have already suggested, had better be razed to the ground when we go, and the only remaining course is to tell the Amir that he will be responsible to Government for the safety of the roads in his territories. His line of action will be to make the Kotaibis responsible to him. He cannot coerce them, and this sop to them will alone preserve their amour propre. 5. Looking at the matter from the Kotaibi Sheikh’s view-point, I cannot but regret that he has not at an earlier date received some compensation for the loss of road dues; and a stipend, long since recommended, would have served to seal the friendship of this tribe and have tended to preserve peace on the road. \ The language now used by Muhammad Saleh is, of course, objectionable, but knowing the man so well, I affirm it is more an appeal ad misericordiam than anything else. My advice is to let him severely alone. To reply is merely to lengthen correspondence unnecessarily and will serve no purpose other than to lower our dignity. Before we go, I strongly again advocate that the Amir’s “ Darbar presents ” should be used to defray the monthly recurring charge of Bs. 50, which will 13&gt; 'i , , , ,, n . • f i,„ tllft a' nir of Dthala and be conditional on the sus- WdTodblvbn out tribl Please see my remarks over unofficial reference No. 1314, dated 8th December 1908, and paragraph 6. • oofa'noensT have SUSTSe fence ino. ±o^, uurx ' * - - fi T believe our policy consisits in acting as I have suggested A strong 6. 1 Deneveourp y embitter the relations, and it is useless remonstrance to his S aLr^ards to carry out.

The blood of our men has been shed. We exercised patience hoping for reparation, while correspondence has passed between us to the effect that our grievances would be considered, but you have done nothin- for us, though we adhered to our friendship not expecting such neglect of our claims and this persistent tyranny. Now we come to know that Gov- ernment intend to remove their posts from the country. This then is to inform VOU oh friend, that there will he an end to all our expectat.ons and endurance When your GoVernment departs, for you will go and leave as under oppression. So we shall consider our own convenience and take our own counsels; tor we are absolved from every tie of responsibility towards Government. Note this most surely, for we look to God. Extract from unofficial reference No. 1344, dated the 8th December 1906, from the Political Agent, Dthala, 6 There is left the rendition to the tribes of Suleik and Nobat. I take it there is no difficulty with the latter place, over, and it would be best to let the buildings stand. The Abdali will take lb) Suleik’s is a more ticklish question. I would propose it he given to the Amir and he told to garrison it. He will at once present it to the Kotaihis. There will ensue trouble at onee between Kotaibis Alawis._ I have several times reported on the undesirability of leaving Dar-al-Quabtan in Alawi hands. The Kotaibis claim the site on which the Dar stands. Although reason for the protection of the road for travellers was one of the assigned reasons for -iving the post to the Alawi Chief, another and as important one, was the desire to cheek the Kotaibis with whom we had just been engaging. Things have changed since then, and the Kotaibis are trying to enter the circle of our friendship. There appear to be two alternatives either— (1) to permit the Alawi’s retention of this Dar as the one condition of road protection and similarly to allow the holders of Suleik fort the same privilege, warning both that their rights will he withdrawn if they use the places for mutual attack and defence ; or (2) to raise both structures before we leave. The Alawi would then erect (we might give him pecuniary assistance) his Bar near his present custom house and from there protect the road, and there wou a practically he no Suleik in existence to hand over to any one. The Amir would be told he was responsible for the road up to Alawi limits. 14 4My meaning is that if Dar-al-Quabfan is demolished Suleik fort should follow suit. If both stand intact, the occupation by the Kotaibis of Suleik might compensate them for the loss of Dar-al-Quabtan’s site at least for the time, nut l am sceptical as to the probability of their withholding for any length of time their hands from the latter place. Here again it would he instructive to have given over these places to the tribes and watched proceedings awhile from Dthala before finally evacuating. Confidential. With regard to the evacuation of Suleik and its rendition to the Arabs. I am of opinion that our best course is to give it to the Amir, or, if the fort is dismantled—which is most advisable —vide my unofficial reference No. 1344, dated 8th instant—we might tell the Amir he is responsible for that part of the country since the Kotaibis are nominally his tribesmen. 2. The “ Dar-al-Quabtan ”—or “ Dar-al-Hamra, 5, as it is also called, might also he reduced so as to lessen the chances of a Kotaibi-Alawi embroglio, and the Alawi Chief told to place his men near the village of A1 Mabaja, which is close to Jimil clearly Alawi territory. 3. The Amir on our evacuation of Suleik will most certainly make the Kotaibis responsible under him for the safety of caravans traversing that region. These tribesmen will, however, not be responsible without any corresponding consideration shown to them ; and never indeed has the Amir been powerful enough to coerce these people, and stillless will he he ab 7 e to overawe them at this time with Dthala and vicinity affairs in so unsettled a condition. 4. It is only reasonable, then, that Muhammad Saleh, the Kotaibi Chief, should he allotted a monthly allowance of Rs 50 for the express purpose of safeguarding the road. The payment of the allowance could be made dependent on a continuance of the good behaviour of the tribe and the mutual good relations of Kotaibis and Alawis in that vicinity. Quoting from letter No. 3861 of 20th June 1905, Chief Secretary to Government of India, Foreign Depart ment, in paragraph 5 thereof, “ we are now fully assured that the Amir is unable to consolidate his position in that tract ” with his Radfan tribesmen absolutely independent of him, paying him no due, considering themselves on an equality with their suzerain and viewing as they now do, his critical position on the Dthala plateau. 5. No treaty engagement is, however, required. All that is necessary is to allot Sheik Muhammad Saleh Rs. 50 per mensem, i.e., to earmark an annual sum of Rs. 600 and make it debitable to the Amiri Darbar Present Grant. In other words the Amir will bo paying the allowance, it will be paid through him so as to enhance the suzerain’s importance, and the Amir will be able^ to with hold the amount if the tribesmen ever display any contumacy. This is adminis tration by and through the Arabs. I am sure it is the first step to ensure order on the Suleik-Habilan. Otherwise the Kotaibis will, with our hacks turned, begin the old role of tax-collections on the road. 6. It mav he remembered further that the Kotaibi Sheikh recovered with a grenl deal of labour and persuasion from his unwilling tribesmen the seven missing Lee-Metford rifles of our troops, and he has never ceased to complain to me of the 15 or 20 Le Gras carbines taken from a Kotaibi section, who sur rendered without resistance to the late Captain M arneford and gave up their arms to him. I recommend most strongly that some compensation ^ be giv en him, and that the best I can suggest is to present him with ten Martini-Henry carbines and 50 rounds of ammunition per arm to be used in the safeguarding of the road. These should he given him through the Amir ol Dthala. 7. Perhaps, at this juncture, it could be arranged to secure the enhanced ipend of our loyal friend the ‘ Alawi Chief Sheikh ’ Ah ^aslnr. 1 he occasion most opportune. The Resident also suggested to this Sheikh at Suleik the 151 dea of callin 0, in his Gras weapons and substituting the Government Martini- Henry. It is well now to execute this plan : a few concessions will do much towards settling the country. 8. It will be sufficient to remind the Resident of the advisability ^ of giving the Haushabi Sultan the proposed increase of stipend, and 50 Martini-Henry carbines to secure some semblance of order on the roads in his territory.

In continuation of correspondence ending with my No. 7335, dated the 9th December 1906, I have the honour to forward, for the information of Government, a copy of the reply which has now been received from the Political Agent, Dthala, to the letter No. 7331, dated the 9th December lb06, of which a copy was forwarded to you with my letter No. 7335, above referred to. 2. Major Jacob’s confidential No. 98, dated the 10th February 1906, is embodied in the correspondence forwarded for my information with your No. 7825, dated the 17th November 1906, and I concur with the opinion that disputes of a civil nature should be disposed of in the Court to which the defendant belongs or the cause of action arises, in general accordance with the principles of ordinary law regarding the jurisdiction of Courts and the venue of suits. 3. Similar principles apply to criminal matters, and provided that there is not too great a readiness to interfere, and that due care is exercised not to attach an exaggerated importance to the incidents which arise, there would seem to be no objection to the general proposition that the Political Agent, Dthala, should occasionally address the Kaimmakam of Kataba with a view to the administration of justice without the delay entailed by reference to Constantinople, and should also advise the Amir of Dthala to administer good justice in those cases which come before him for trial. 4.

No. 1371, dated Dthala, the December 1906 (Confidential). From— Major H. F. Jacob, Political Agent, Dthala, To—&gt;The First Assistant Resident, Aden. In reply to your confidential No. 7334 of 9th December 1906, I have the honour to state that this is no matter for extradition. No such demand has 16been preferred by the Kaimmakam, but the Turkish official’s request for nor does my No. 1330 touch on anything reparation. 2. The criminal is an Amiri subject of Hazatml-Abid : the place of crime was Amin territory : the murdered man was a Turkish subject. 3. The Amir has promised to arrest the man and try the case, but urged e unsuitability of the occasion now that the tribes in the vicinity were opposed to him. I have not, therefore, insisted on the immediate arrest, and have informed the Kaimmakam that the necessary retribution will follow in due course. 4. I am informed that the trouble with Jebal Jihaf is likely to be patched up, and as the Amir is now intent on dealing with Shairis only, it is better that the “ Haza affair ” should be temporarily dropped. I shall not suffer the mattter to be lost sight of. 5. I attach a summary of complaints as asked in your 3rd paragraph. It is marked “ Q ” Fide also mark “ P.” “P.” Referred to in confidential letter No. 1371, dated the — December 1906. 14th Reference is first of all invited to my Confidential No. 93 of 10th February 1906 and sheet “ A ” of 20th idem signed by Colonel Churchill, my loeum tenens. Of the 11 cases there listed, all may be dealt with as suggested in last paragraph of my No. 98 (above) and in greater detail in statement “ Q ” attached. H. F. JACOB, Major, Political Agent, Dthala, “ Q” In a letter, dated 17th A1 Hijja 1823 {i.e., 10th February 1906) the Amir of Dthala reported to my locum tenens, then Colonel Churchill, that Sayid Abdallah Ali, one of his subjects, was robbed in Yemen by Sayid Ahmed Mohsin and the son of Sheikh Abdul Qawi Ash Shaibi and their people, of $500, a rifle with equipment, one Jambia and one mule with equipment. Colonel Churchill asked Kaimmakam in a letter, dated 8th February 1906, to recover the stolen money and the other things. In a letter, dated the 25th Al Hijja lb23 {i.e., 18th February 1906), the Kaimmakam said that he had referred the matter to higher authorities and that the result would be communicated in due course. The Kaimmakam was again requested as per letter No. »3l8, dated the 12th April 1906, to send a speedy reply, but these frequent changes of officials have no doubt delayed a settlement. I propose to meet Kaimmakam at Sanah and press for early settlement of this and all other cases. Abdallah Bey is an Arab and an honest man, I believe. In all these cases when an Amiri is com plainant, I would recommend that the complainant appear before Kaimmakam’s Court in’ Kataba, furnished with my precis of the Amir’s claim. In crss-cases, the Turkish subjects may well appear before the Amir. In these latter cases, the Amir’s adjudication would be notified to me, and I would scrutinize it before informing the Kaimmakam, Kataba ; in the former, where the hearing is made at Kataba, the Kaimmakam would he asked to make it a rule to inform me of the decision passed, which would be forwarded to the Amir. If dissatis fied the Amir would again address me. I see no other cause of action, so lon^ as we stay in Dthala. It must be recollected that across the line the jurisdiction is Turkish not Arab : over here, the jurisdiction is Amin but supervised by Political Agent. 17■ i Ilf? B. ,, In a letter, dated 1st Jumad al Awal 1324 {ie., 23rd June 1906), the Amir of Dthala reported to me that some of his people of Zubaid when passing through the districts of Eb were robbed by Bin Suhail of seven laden camels. The Kaimmakam was sent copy of the Amir’s letter with a covering letter from me No 603, dated 5th July 1906. The Amir again in letter, dated the 30th Jumad al Awal 1324 (i.e., 22nd July 1906), detailed the robbery embodied in his former letter (above). Secondly, he urged that the son of Ahmad Nagi al Yubi of Markhaza in the district of Eb had robbed a cow and a donkey of Lakamt Ad Duki. The Kaimmakam of Kataba was sent copy of the Amir’s letter. He replied as per his letter dated 28th Jumad al Awal 1324 (20th July 1906 ) that the matter had been referred to Kaimmakam of Eb, and that on receipt of the latter’s reply he would apprise me. In continuation of this his letter, the Kaimmakam wrote as regards Nagi _ Musleh ^ Sub ail that the matter was under enquiry : as regards Ahmad Nagi al Yubi, that the stolen animals had been recovered by their original owners. The Amir was sent an extract of the Kaimmakam’s letter. He replied that he had on many occasions complained against Nagi JVTusleh of Eb, but had not so fax received redress, but that enquiry would be made {sic) as to the animal’s restoration. In a letter, dated 27th liajab 1324 (16th September 1906), the Amir promised to enquire whether the Zubaidis had recovered their camels, etc. Nothing further has been reported by the Amir. ' c. 5 ’ In a letter, dated the 10th Kajab 1324 (*.&lt;?., 30th August 1906), the Amir wrote that Abdulla Muthana Ali, his son and nephew, all of Hthala, had been to Yemen on a visit of condolence. Arriving there Quasim Ahmad al Jarabi told off some soldiers who unlawfully confined them in a dark. Again in a letter, dated 17th Ttajab 1324 (ie.,6th September 1906) the Amir reiterated the above complaint and added that they (his people) were not allowed to remove and take away the estate of the deceased. The Amir further said in his letter that the deceased had some money due to him from one Hamid. To a letter dated 27th Kajab 1324 {i.e. t 16th September 1906) the Amir attached a chit from a third party which goes to give the lie to the letter from the Kaimma kam, whose letter is dated 13th Eajab 1324 {i.e., 2nd August 1906). In it he says that Musleh Suhail ignores the charge, and further asks that the aggrieved party may be sent to Kataba to confront the accused. The Amir was sent copy of Kaimmakam’s letter and was asked to do the needful. In a letter dated 27th Rajab 1324 {i.e., 16th September 1906) the Amir engaged to send me the aggrieved party, but hitherto has failed. Eor mode of settling this and all these matters, please see my comments below case A. “ I), ,, In a letter, dated the 20th Rajab 1324 {i.e., 9th September 1906) the Amir reported that Bin Ahmad Nagi al Yubi of Markhaza had seized a camel belonging to Umar Qahtan of Shib al Usud. The Kaimmakam of Kataba was asked in a letter No. 931 of 9th September 1906 to make reparation. No reply has yet been received from the Kaimmakam, although reminder No. 1274 was sent on the 19th ultimo (e.e., November 1906). E.” In a letter, dated the 20th Rajah 1324 {i.e., 9th September 1906), the Amir reported that a Turkish Mulazim of Kataba had hired a cow, camel and 18a_donkey belonging to one Quasim Saleh of Gammal of Sanah (AmM on eon the should carry two sick men to Taiz Ou arriyin» at Kataba they were laden with eight maunds tobacco.

Kaimmakam has been informed. “ G” There are several other complaints of Shairis believed to exist, but as these people will not approach the Amir during the existing ill-feeling, it is difficult to gauge their extent. One or two Jalila complainants for non-payment of dues and dispute in land on the Turkish side were sent to the present Kaimma- kam of Kataba, but in the case of lands so situated, the obvious remedy is for the Jalila party to repair to the local court. “ H” In a letter, dated the 7th March 1906, Edulji Cooverji, Dthala’s Agent, petitioned to me that his Arab Agent, who buys potatoes for him from Yemen, had been interfered with by Sheikh Ali Hasan Sanani of Eb, who detained ten camels while in the Agent’s charge, laden with potatoes. The Kaimmakam was addressed letter No. 216 of 15th March 1906. In a letter No. 3, dated 17th April L906, the Kaimmakam of Kataba said that letters from Kaimma kam of Eb ignored all knowledge of such interference and that the latter offi cial would have the people bring their grievances to him in future. Amir was so informed. In letter No. 426 of 13th May 1906 Kaimmakam of Kataba was informed by me that the loads of potatoes had been recovered, hut that accord ing to the owner’s statement he had to pay a douceur to the Turkish soldiers to effect the recovery. The matter was then dropped. I record this case—though settled—as a sample of what may frequently take place here, and owing to the contiguity of the border such cannot but be chronic. “ A” Dated the 2nd Shawal 1324 (18th November 1906).

On his return journey, as he neared Al Hazza, he was accosted by two men of Al Abid, who deliberately murdered him and carried away his goods.

I reminded him of the many as yet nnsettled claims preferred by the Amir through me to the Kataba authorities and reminded the Kaimmakani that good relations on the border were possible only if measures were reciprocal.

I told Sheikh Salim of A1 Malaha (the Shajri Chief) yesterday that I would’not permit Muresis to participate in the Shairi quarre! with the Amir; and that the sooner he sent back these Turkish subjects the better fw him. He effected surprise, saying that the inter-relations of Shams and Muresis were of long standing. He seemed to be unable to grasp the new condition of affairs since the border was delimited. 3. The Amir has not succeeded in enlisting the tribes as M expected, hut I hear that some of the Halmin people, and the Hijaili section or the Kadfan have joined his forces. 4. In the meantime I have again impressed upon the Amir that no fighting will he permitted in the vicinity of our camps. 5. Many independent Peace Parties are endeavouring to secure a reconci liation. The Shairis have assured me they will not attack the Amir, hut are preparing merely for defence, so as not to betaken unawares. 6. The Amir’s action is inexplicable. I have called on him to explain.

Oh friend, this distur bance would undoubtedly be a serious matter and cause bloodshed between both parties. 'We do not wish that such a great fight should take place just in the midst of your soldiers. Our utmost hope is that you might endeavour to suppress this sedition and reduce the tribesmen of the Amir to order and obedience. As you had so kindly saved the Amir from aggressions of the Turks in the beginning, you may now complete your favour in the end, by subjugat ing his tribesmen. Otherwise you might allow us to proceed to*Dthala, so that we may endeavour to make the tribesmen submit their obedience to the Amir. This may he effected by the help of our friend, Major Jacob. Diffi culties could be alleviated by timely steps being taken before any act of violence is perpetrated. May you be preserved. No. 7584, dated Aden Residency, the 22nd December 1906.

A Kotaibi camel, which was engaged on hire for work at the Suleik post, was stolen by Subaihis on the 20th instant, ^whilst proceeding vith a load of vegetables from Nohat Dakim to Suleik. The thieves are reported to have been certain two or three Subaihis of the Gazera clan and a tardy pursuit by certain of the Abdali soldiers posted at Nobat Dakim was ineffective. 3. The theft occurred on a portion of the road for the safety of which the Haushabi Sultan is primarily responsible, and pending the further orders of Government, I am instructing the Political Agent, Dthala, to press the Sultan for reparation as well as to punish the offenders and to take such measures as are necessary to secure greater safety of the road.Ko. 176, dated Bombay Castle, the 10 th January 1907 (Secret).

On the occa sion of the expedition sent by Government against us, the troops destroyed our cultivation, crops and Kirbis. They set fire to the beehives, demolished the houses and destroyed the fields of coffee. They cut the bear trees, robbed our property, and took away the arms of the Kotaibi Section, who went to meet the Government but were faithlessly dealt with by the soldiers. The blood of our men was shed and we patiently tolerated all that happened to us with the belief that Government would have some consideration for us. Some negociation took place between Major Jacob, the Political Agent, Dthala, and ourselves, and he gave us a paper in regard to some of the things mentioned by us and said that you would listen to every possible complaint we might make. We there fore referred our grievances to you, but you have paid no heed to them nor have you done us any justice. We are, however, keeping patience, acting in a friendly manner and hoping you would not disregard these grievances which we have referred to you, and would not continue to oppress us. Now we have come to know of some news to the effect that the soldiers of Government will be removed from their quarters in the Hinterland ; so we write this to inform you, Oh friend, that all that is due to us is recorded and that our patience will cease after the Government has abandoned its posts in the Hinterland. We tell you that we are oppressed, and that after the withdrawal of the posts we shall direct our attention to such a course as may be favourable for us to adopt.

After compliments.— I have received your letter of the 4th January re the Shairis There has been much correspondence between us in connection with fids affair There is a Treaty between me and Government, and since I am Government's friend', it is not befitting that you should traverse my author.ty, ot intervene in Arab affairs. If you mean to abide by the established friend- ship and treaty, do not interfere in our affairs which is contrary to precedent. I am vour sincere friend and do not wish to displease you. Please do you likewise and desire nothing save the display of my power and authority which hvvour'words you have formerly upheld. But if by chance customs have changed I shall noi thwart or oppose you, while if you oppose me I shall not oppose vour troops, nor you, ever at all. Nay rather, I shall offer you my back Z” chastise) and you mav do as you like. So as the tribesmen are massed from all sides—Balmin, Badfan, Yafai-and we are still engaged in heating them up—and as those joined with me are also friends of Government and keen on their friendship you will witness, by your interference, trouble on the roads and in other places from all of which I must be absolved in every way. Don’t then hereafter turn to me and say you were, not knowing all this This is now a witness against you. The tribesmen are men of pride who hold to a promise and have self-esteem, and they cannot turn back without humiliation. A train, the Shairis have rejected the “Sharia” and your letter is a testimony against you in my hand. The “ Sada ” approached them all honourable men—hut these other rejected their overtures in terms of the “ Sharia ” which God has appointed and his Apostle. If then your idea is wrongful interference, lo! we are your friends. You are powerful and we cannot withstand you. On the contrary we will say “ Truly to God we belon, and to Him we return ” and again “ there is no might and no power save m God the Lofty One and the Great.” H. P. JACOB. The 4th January 1907. I told Amir that if he disturbed the peace of the plateau I would interfere. This I said because I was afraid of Kolaibi interference on the roads, and the complete break-up in this eventuality, of the Amir’s House. I never have interfered in his affairs save to pursuade him to abandon the insane idea of subjecting the Shairis. This Amir Shaif well knows. I have spoken to him and written totem on this point ad nauseam. The history and geographical position of this tnoe 26 r27 near the Turkish border hns compelled me now it appears I cao intervene no longer, but of all my schemes. to interfere up to this dete, and must witness the breaking up # The Amir holds a dozen letters from me warning him of the futility of DeS g er U 1906 r War^l0rS • (See notes of his i^erview with me on 4th This piece of Amiri reasoning should he noted ! I told the Amir when I concluded the former three months, truce that if, hv its close the Shams still rejected the “ Sharia(to which all good Moslems are supposed to appeal to settle their differences), he might tahe his own measure and I would assist him if he was powerless to do anything. My assistance was of course only moral. As the truce was being concluded and discussed, and also shortly after its conclusion, the Amir’s people continued their pin-pricks, nor would he, till some time after, proclaim the truce in his markets—a circum stance which greatly exasperated the Shairis and considerably lessened the probability of their submitting to the Moslem “ Sharia.” After this the history is well known. He implored me to intercede and at once concocted repressive schemes to coerce the Shairis, forfeiting thereby, as I told him, all claims on my assistance and intervention. Added to this, were the Eesident’s instruc tions to leave the Amir to settle his affairs unaided. H. F. JACOB. II. Dthata, Saturday, 6th January 1907. The Amir called, very dejected, to see me and with him the intermediary Saleh “ Ubi-yed al Yameni from Sultan Ahmad Fadthl with Sultan Maudtha Saif of Lower Yafa.” I told him that in terms of his letter “ P ”, in which he asked me not to interfere, I was one with him, and although I had written him yesterday that if he disturbed the peace of the country-side by attacking the Shairis (and thereby drawing in a multitude of others including the Kotaibis), I would stop the fight by force, yet now, if he longed to fight and had brought his hordes (withal contrary to my advice) to Dthala, he was at liberty to do so as he, the Amir of the country, thought best in the circum stances. One thing I would tell him, viz., that Government did not look approvingly on the devastation of the Shairi country and the abasement of its people, and so, if he elected to fight, Government would not give him assistance either in men or ammunition. He must work out his own salvation The Amir and party pleaded the enormous expenses that would fall on his exchequer if he had to dismiss his forces at this stage. I replied that he had brought them up contrary to my orders and advice and, though I sympathised with him in his losses, the blame attached to him and him only. Again, I did not any longer insist on his breaking them up but only counselled him on lines similar to those already pressed on him, viz., to desist from massing his forces in Dthala so long as we remained in the country. If he so wished, and he did not believe the Shairis would acquiesce in submission to him as father, I hereby gave him carte blanche to use his men, though not in the vicinity of our camps (when we should be obliged to ward off any possible danger to ourselves) and without our assistance. He was asking for' my counsel rather late in the day, and it was a pity he had not listened to my advice before. The Amir and party then begged me to take ten hostages from both sides— the Shairi ten to be sent to Aden. I asked him what were the precise terms on which he would have me intervene, for he had mentioned a document between the late Amir ' Ali Mukbil and the Shairis which laid down their respective rights and duties. The Amir should shew me this document before I approached the Shairis, as I could not offer them terms when I was in the dark as to the28 „ f f1 ,. .J,;,! document: the Sbairis would not possibly otherwise agree to n e t n Aos tes nd I d“lined to compel them to do so. The Amir said he togmngnosM a m e nt tbat the Shains had one copy; and he was could not give m purport was! I then said that if he wished for himself unaware ^11 disband his forces, otherwise the IS who w“re merely defending their homes would never even to agree to mv mldiatTon: If the Amir, in fine, wished for my mediation, it must be on mv terms Which were these : either he must produce the said document when I my terms wnicn _ tmoe to discuss matters, or he must pass a written “sanad 1 ” couched in the terms he had implored me to use that night of the 4th December when he made an ad mismcorto appeal to me to check the impending disintegration of his country. The terms he then begged me to put before tbe Shairis were as follows &lt;« I do not want to tax the Shairis, for indeed I have never taxed them. I do not wit to subject these persons for they are tribesmen. I do not want to not want 1 merely want their recognition of my fathership and th Sr Obedience 1 to my orders ” These then were the two alternative. With either of them I would approach the Shairis within the ten days’ truce and in that case I would not press for the disbandment of his forces though I believed the Shairis would not vacate their mtrenchments on Turkish position till this menace was withdrawn. The Amir said that neither alternative was palatable to him and both of them 1 lowered his dignity with his tribesmen Government should interest in him as Ruler and abandon the inclusion ot r\ -t orh-nnC'ii'Wi people. I replied that the question of his tribesmen was inextricably interwoven with the weal of his own house, and that Government countenanced his Amir- shin so Ion' only as he ruled with the consent and assent of his people. Further, I dealt with hirn as Amir, and if he had the document concluded in AliMukbils time, I asked it from him and not from his children, the Shairis. The Amir asked what I would do, if, say, the Shairis refused my media tion even when conducted on my own lines, and his reinforcements were sent awav I repeated that I would not press for the disbandment if he really meant to negotiate, and would do my best so long as he consented to a ten days truce. He objected to tbe truce unless I took hostages, first of all, from both sides. This I absolutely declined to do. Either he must accept my own method of intervention, or must pursue whatever course he thought best. Tins was final Otherwise I would take his advice and interfere neither to assist him nor to work against him. I told him of the Kotaibi resolve to attack him in rear if the Jabal Jibaf or Shairis were worsted, and though I had strongly opposed such meanness on the Kotaibis 5 part, I would not answer for the freaks of this irresponsible tribe. The Amir asked what I would do if his forces were employed against Jahal jihaf and the Shairis assisted the latter. I said that so far as the collection ot his taxes on that Hill were concerned, I would not assist him in their recovery, for although I believed he had a right to tax, carefully prescribed by Moslem tradition, yet he began his collection two years ago at a very inopportune time, contrary to my advice, and in a manner that closely resembled the iniquitous practices of the Turks on that very Hill. If &gt; however, he wished to exact repara tion at Hazza (his village) for the recent murder by his subjects of a ^ Turkish subiect, I would protest against the wanton interference of the Shairi (this in spite of the compact between Jabal Jihaf and the Shu’ar), and if these folk persisted, then X had no objection to bis including them in his objective ana dealing out their well merited punishment. The Amir wondered why his old friendship with Government was now so suddenly abrogated. He saw, he said, that to fight was displeasing to Govern ment, and so he must perforce disband his forces; suffer pecuniary losses untold;recline at home a mere puppet; view the dismemberment of his country in silence and remorse, and he hoped Government would not then make him res ponsible for the security for the roads. By the Treaty he responsible, hut how could he fulfil his engagements if his country was to be disintegrated. Jtners, now sitting on the fence/’ would observe this confession of his inabi lity to coerce his tribesmen, and, taking their cue accordingly, would set up separate and petty principalities and then good bye, for ever, to his authority and the peace of the country. J With this parthian shot he withdrew. The 5th January 1907. H. F. JACOB, Major, Political Agent, Dthala. My interview with Muhammad Saleh at Suleik on 1st and 2nd and 3rd instant was to prevent the Kotaibis joining the Amir’s forces at Dthala and also, more especially, to dissuade him from carrying out the hint, couched in his letter, that if the Amir succeeded in enlisting some of the Kotaibis, the others would be sorely tempted to mass and take the Amir’s places at Hardaba, “ at Tafwa ” and Karafa. This because (1) the Amir had persistently neglected to settle his differences with the Kotaibis, and (2) the Amir was wantonly trvino- to create divided counsels in this tribe by enlisting a portion of them against the Chief’s wishes, thereby overthrowing Muhammad Saleh’s endeavours to rehabilitate himself as the one recognised head of the Kotaibi clan. 2. I told Muhammad Saleh that with his great expectations from Govern ment he would be ill-advised to mix himself in any way in the Amiri-Shairi quarrel which I was striving to break up. He replied he would do his best in the matter, but the Amir had sown discord and he could not guarantee his tribesmen holding aloof. Further, he had a tacit agreement with Jabal Jihaf to discountenance the opposition and ill-feeling of the Amir towards them : that the Jabal Jihafis were tribesmen and not subjects, and the British Government had acted with undue haste when they gave over Jabal Jihaf, which was clearly a Zindnni possession, to the rule of the Amir of Dthala. The Amir might indeed be styled overlord, but what gain to the original holders was the°re if the iniquitous Turkish regime had merely been transferred to an equally tyrannical Amiri administration ? That the Amir might rightly tax his own subjects, for there the land was his own and the fields were tilled by his own. (&amp;) As to the Shairis, there was a compact made with them in the time of Amir Ali Mukbil, the predecessor of Amir Shaif, and their respective rights and duties were there clearly defined. If the Government left the country at this juncture, he, Muhammad Saleh, foresaw nothing but bloodshed and unrest, for the Amir had made many enemies during the British occupa tion of Dthala. 3. I saw the Alawi Chief also at A1 Kash’a on the 3rd instant. He had been asked to join the Amir, but flatly declined to come up save as a mediator. This Sheikh also denounced the Amir’s pretentions on Jabal Jihaf and the Sharif both of whom were tribesmen as opposed to subjects. He said, further, that the Amir’s rule by subordinates had incensed the whole country-side and that Habil Jubari, the Dthala suburb, which was largely populated by Alawi men, had written to him its resolve to migrate southwards. This last remark is perhaps incorrect. Sheikh Ali Nasher is biased against the Amir for various reasons. 4 Mv own idea is that it is all important to stop the Amir’s bellicose inten- lions at Dthala, for I am convinced that he has po just nor sane claim against L Shairis If he merely wishes their recognition ot his fathership, he should leave them alone altogether. The blood feud has been continuous between hem for some 160 years, and, as tribal custom in the matter of the lex tahoms ■wertides Koranic sanction as interpreted by the commentators, it is well nigh impossible to proceed on lines that would appeal only to more civilised peoples. 29 C32FD30 • ~ t nn liprp striven to create a better feelinsrbetween 1 have, ever since ^e r ’ been obsessed by the strong belief, to whiaae Ws Pin-prieks have lent colour, that the Amir’s overtm-es were insincere and that his real object was their subjectio . _ _ n Vp Tihnl .Tahaf I am somewhat inclined to lean towards the opinion 5S 5“£ C““ ” —'Li f overlord, I ’’f''®' 0 ^ iTi i Hil ir essentially a tribal possession.

The only course feasible at this time is to let things alone, and to watch progress. , . . , Immediate demonstrationa.t an earlier period would, i “ saved the situation and deterred the now long devised machinations of Jabal Jihaf I understand the times were unpropitious for our intervention. The Amiris his worst enemy, or, rather has his policy of s ^servience to ^is s of his son Nasr, who has the ear of the underlings the Dtbala Hushais brought the old man to the predicament he now is in. 8 The Amir left my tent after the interview of the 5th instant and said he would pay of his men who nad arrived in force on the evening of the 4rd idem. On rejoining his camp lie was evidently talked over, and counsels were divided. 9. This morning at 3 a m. firing began generally and has been in progress all day. There have been a few casualties on each side. The Amir has seized the Black Hill, and the Shairi villages of A1 Wabh and Jalas. The ^ Shams remain in possession of Turkish position, “ One-boulder ” Hill, and Hog s Back. The fighting is going on between Black Hill and Al Wabh and also m the direction of Al Koren at the head of the Khoraiba Pass. I n the vicinity ot our camp there is quiet. 10. The Amir has some 1,500 to 2,000 adherents, including a few Kaladis (Lower Yafa) the Hadfan clans of Hijaili, Ahl Abdallah, Bakri, some Oa iris and some Dtliambaris, and of course the Azarek. The Shaiiis are sai to 6 assisted by Sha’ih. The Jahal Jihaf are opposing the Amir’s forces up the Hill. 11. It is better after my interview with the Amir, to stand by and not interfere. The Amir has taken all risks on himself. I said that if he fought, even at this eleventh hour when another course was possible he must clearly understand I would remain strictly neutral, and it would be futile for him to ask for assistance if matters went agaiust him. I told him of the Kotaibi threat which he must avert himself and that the best course was ot course disbandment. He has thought otherwise. The 8th January 1907* H. P.

[Secret.] Memorandum on the Hinterland, with special reference to Amiri-Shairi matters ; the Turkish frontier, and suggestions in re our evacuation. Mv Kotaihi report No. 6! of this date will fully illustrate my meanmg when 1 say that we have not adequately gauged the Arab miad L r , ra phs Hour in matters of administration. I refer more especially to para 0 rapthereof 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7, which comprise my views on this point of the Amir’s suzerainty over his tribesmen. It is best at this stage to let things take their course. There were two alcernatives either (1) to bolster up the Amir in terms of the earliest stated policy, or (2) to recognise the Arab’s noted objection to a predominant partner and to follow the line of tribal penchant and idiosyncrasy. The Amir has sown the wind and is reaping the whirlwind. At^ our departure he will be compelled to come to an early settlement of his differences, 2. As to the Amir’s recent reverse at the hands of the Shairi, a truce is now being discussed both with the Shairis and Jabal Jihafis who have combined to withstand the Amir. Negotiations are said to commence after the Td, which falls on 25th instant. Muharram the following month is held to be sacred. In it war is vetoed. This may facilitate a temporary truce. The Amir is trying to arrange some modus vivendi with Jabal Jihaf by which he hopes to satisfy the Shairis also. The Amir has no claims on lands in Shairi territory proper, but has private property on the Hill ; hence his anxiety to propitiate these Jihafis, who are incensed by his recent and exorbitant revenue collections on their Hill. At the same time a report is current that failing a truce, which the Shairis are disinclined to concede to Amiri treachery, the Amir will seek to regain his prestige, and will once more call in his lately dismissed mercenaries and also use his own guns. 3. If this latter be the correcter estimate, or even if a truce be proclaimed, it is better, I think, for us to tarry a little longer on this plateau, for our presence tends towards peace and this influence should not be withdrawn too quickly. I would suggest that our departure synchronise with the close of February. If the Amir, after all, elects to fight, I see no finality to the bad feeling abroad, but on the other hand we can effect but little by a more prolonged stay, so long as I have so small a voice in Arab affairs. 4. The result of fighting will, however, be the rise of various and petty principalities a’d over the Amir’s dominions. Others, e.g., his tribes, on the Elver Tiban, of Hamada and Ahmedi, on seeing the Amir s discomfiture nearer home, and his reduction, which I prophesy, to the bare status of “ Sheikh of Dthala ” will themselves start to carve out independent pnnci- palities ” la other words, the Arabs seeing our impending depart are and abstention from tribal affairs, are working towards the cherished goal or tubal independence and a minimum of Arab control. 5. There will then arise the question of the Amir’s ability to fuiai his Treaty conditions qua the security of the route from Dthala to the fron . If he fails here, his Treaty will call for amendment. I have often represented to the Amir the gravity of the situation, and pointed to the abyss to which he is fast moving. He, however, is much in the hands of subordinates. If again worsted in fight, Amir ^ of vexation, or very possibly be ousted from his position. He has not endeared himself even to the people of Ethala town. 6 Jabal Jihaf, as already reported, is administered by one Mukbil Nagi Zindani The Zindani faction was predominent during Turkish ascendency and before this, and the house of Zindani received a Turkish dole. Even now^ H the Hill be severed from the Amir, I f a “ ^^^ethois are distasteful to S!KrS»WSr5S'«iS?iM -* tm* «-vt withstand^he Amir’s advances, and if the present rancour subsides I predict the fall of this upstart and a reversion to the independence of t e i • Turkish intrigue will certainly he rife there if the Amir’s influence is on the wane, and its working will he the more subtle since the boundary now delimited has reduced visible violation to a minimum. / C322D7 There renin.in. uusettleii, certtiin drums preferred l&gt;y the Amir egsunSt Turtish suhiects as recorded in my Confi.lential Memorandum No 1371 of 14tli Desrniber 1906. I liad proposed that during our stay here _ L should be tlie medium for the Amir’s protestations and should similarly receive the Kahn- makam’s replies and forward these to the Amir. These claims and cross- claims cannot be but chronic. As soon as the present cases are settled, others f will succeed, for the commerce across the line is extensive. With our political removal, there is nothing left but to permit direct correspondence between Amir and Kaimmakam as prevail'd before our advent. bating to get satisfaction, the Amir will apply to Aden, and the Kaimmakam to laiz to Sanaa. (a) I have elsewhere detailed the necessary recurrence of ill-will caused by the excessive tithe collections of .Turkish Arabs on land*Amiri drifted by the late demarcation across the line. So long as the lines are thus interlaced, disputes are inevitable. On Amiri lands passed by delimitation across the border, the Amir collects the revenueSi hut the ^Turkish Arabs exact the tithes, and often in excess of the recognised one-tenth of the produce. Turkish lands drifted across to the Amiri s’de'are similarly treated, except that the Amir confines his tithes to the strict one-tenth. He, however, has often threatened reprisals. An exchange of lands might be suggested as the panacea, hut the Arab does not like to part with bis own. Trouble, then, is ever imminent and affairs maybe brought to an impaste. The Kaimmakam has been written to by me and has promised to enquire, hut he is so often away from Kataba collecting his revenues, that I have been so far unable to fix a meeting. Unless some more definite policy is decreed by Government, and as we have fully resolved to evacuate, any pro longed stay on this account will effect hut little. The Amir may he told to exercise patience, but perhaps if he did copy Turkish methods and enhance bis tithes on Turkish lands, the other party would be the readier to compromise. I think it is possible to overact the role of Aristides. Our justice should not be misconstrued to mean weakness. 1 . nf i; jj i i 8 . As regards the tlnee dismantled pillars in Sha’bi territory, I would advocate at this state that they he repaired by Sheikh Mutahir Ali to whom we pay dollars 7 per mensem as custodian of these three pillars situated in his country. Unless we go there with Turkish congnizance, Turkish suspicions will be' aroused and the work stopped pending reference to Constantinople. The course I suggest will preclude such a contingency. The work will he carried out on the spot and quietly by the Sheikh concerned at his expense according to the agreement. The pillars are not absolutely raised, tbeir bases remain intact 0 nr journey there will be expensive, moreover, by reason of present to Sha’bi Sheikhs. 9. Adverting to Juban-Nawa l)’thabiani affairs : I am not clear as to Government’s intentions there. All the trio dread Turkish advances. Juban has often asked petulently how with the inter-tribal nexus that prevails between itself, Nawi, D’thabiani, Upper Yafa and Rubia’ten, Government have brought all save itself within the circle of their friendship. Nawa and D’thabiani are doubtful which side of the line they fall. At times they abuse my apathy towards them, at others, they crave British protection, while, again, they write asserting their independence of both Governments. The Mausata clan of Upper Y’afa, where we have two stipendiaries, have tribal agreements with Juhan and lately went there to settle Juban-Nawa disputes. The border we have lately demarcated twnxt ourselves and the Turks is unintelligible to the tribes, who, accustomed for ages to meddle in each other’s affairs, ignore this recent political division of rights, witness the help given by the Turkish Ahl Mures to the Shairis on their late skirmish with Amir Stiaif. ' 10. As to Upper Yafa : Kahtan bin Umar, the Sultan of the D’thubi Section, is still not restored to his former authority, though he has just written optimistically about it.

Apart from these there are numberless Sheikhs in the north-east who are indepen dent rulers, and many of these have earnestly begged to be protected against Turkish invasipn. With all these I have urged the satiety of the British Government with what they already hold and their friendship with the Turkish Government which precludes any interference witli tribes under Turkish regime or influence. Our influence there is in the ascendant. 13, It does not do to prophesy in matters relative to Turks and Imam- If, however, and the contingency is not chimerical, a compromise be arranged between the two belligerents, it is not unlikely that w r e may witness a change in the map, and may find the Imam displacing Turk on some of our borders. It is with this possibility in view that I have so steadfastly urged a policy of neutrality, which, while preserving our friendship with Turks, did not consider the other party as rebels. The whole country from Sanaa to Aden was once Irnamic. The Imam’s vicegerents w r ere the ancestors of the present Chiefs and rulers within our Protectorate. The Amir of Dthala holds Sanads from the Imam : so do many families on the Hill of Jihaf. This then was possible in spite of the differences in ritual which divide onf Shafai (Sunni) Chiefs from the Imam’s Section the Zaidi (Shia). These differences in Arabia are non-essentials and little accounted of in the Yemen; therefore, if the Imam’s borders at any time marched with ours, it would be no strange thing at all if he and our friends fraternised as of yore.The Imma’s attitude^ towards ’j^evered as he is aflord to discount name is always spoken of with aSeotion, but in the Yemen.

From— Major-General E. DeBrath, C.B., C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident, I have the honour to invite reference to your letter No. HIP., dated the 22nd June 1906, regarding the repair of three of the pillars which were erected by Colonel Wahab’s Boundary Commission and have since been dismantled, and to report that I arranged some months ago for the Political Agent, Dthala, to proceed to the locality in company with Sheikh Ali Mohsin Askar to super vise the repair of these pillars by the Sheikh responsible for them. 2. Ali Mohsin Askar has however so suffered from ill-health since this arrangement was made that it has not hitherto proved possible to carry it into effect. 3. In reporting Ali Mohsin Askar’s convalescence, Major Jacob now recommends that the repairs of the pillars should be left to Sheikh Motahar Ali who is in receipt of an allowance granted for the purpose, and remarks that this procedure is less likely to attract attention which might lead to diplomatic reference to Constantinople and consequent delay than his own presence on the spot. The bases of the old pillar still exist, so there can be no doubt as to their correct position. 4. In view of the present disturbed state of the country, I have the honour now to recommend that this course should be adopted. No. 1109, dated Bombay Castle, the 8 th February 1907. From —H. O.

With reference to correspondence ending with your telegram, dated the 10th instant, in which I was informed that the Government of India was unable to pass orders on the proposed grant of a stipend to the Kotaibi Sheikh, as the proposal was but a portion of the bigger question which required careful consideration as a whole, I now have the honour to forward, for the consider ation of Government, copy of a memorandum on the subject, No. 61, dated the 22nd instant, which I have this week received from the Political Agent at Dthala. 2 The bigger question referred to in your telegram under reference is doubtless that alluded to in my letters No. 3419, dated the 9th June 1906, and No 6267, dated the 21st October 1906, to which no reply has been accorded. And I need not here repeat what has already been urged hy this Residency m favour of securing a more effective fulfilment of their treaty obligations, by the Chiefs of this Protectorate and of rendering them the requisite assistance to enable them to do so. Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. 3738 I*' 3. So far as the Kotaibi Chief is concerned, I would repeat the recom. mendation that he should he granted the proposed stipend of Es. 50 a month, and add that it would seem politic to confirm the desired reconciliation with that tribe either by the grant of a suitable present of rifles and ammunition, or by the restoration of the arms confiscated in 1903. I would definitely recommend a present of 50 rifles with 100 rounds of ammunition per rifle as# the preferable course, in virtue of which the tribe should, as Major Jacob^ suggests, be held responsible for the Hahilen portion of the Aden-Dthala road. 4. At the same time the Alawi Sheikh's responsibility might similarly be allocated and defined upon the grant to him of the concessions which I have already recommended. And I then see no reason why his post should not be moved, as Major Jacob suggests, from Ear al Quabtan to Mabaja near Jimil. 5. I do not recommend that the Kotaibi should be under any circum stances allowed to re-impose road dues on passing caravans. A memorandum on Hinterland affairs 'with special reference to the relations existing between the Amir of Dtbala and his tribesmen. No. 61. The late Captain Warneford had a definite policy initiated by the Eesidency and aiming at the reconciliation of the Kotaibis to ourselves after the fight. He failed because his terms to Muhammad Saleh offered the latter no corre sponding advantages. In consideration of their return to an amicable state of mind which would conduce te peace on the road they were to become friends of Government, hnt there was nothing tangible to tempt their return. My immediate predecessor Major Merewether mentioned to Muhammad Saleh the possibility of a stipend from Government, and I have been able after much trouble to persuade the Chief and tribesmen to visit me both here and at Suleik, and have myself also held out the possibility of some quid pro quo as compensation for the loss of revenue which our prohibition of their road dues entailed. 2. In August 1905 I drew up a provisional memorandum in which Muhammad Saleh unconditionally waived all claims to road dues,—taken confessedly contrary to custom,—and also engaged that he would safeguard the route lying along his country, if ever his hounds were restored to him. Eurther, were a stipend given him he undertook first of all to win and main tain control over his tribesmen and to arrange for them an adequate division of the expected favours of Government. 3. This clan, more than the others who collectively form what is termed the Eadfan tribesmen, have always suffered from internal divisions and the inconveniences of many scattered leaders, and Muhammad Saleh’s Chieftaincy was disputed—notably by his nephew Mukbil Abdallah who speaks for a large following. By dint of always refusing this man an audience and making him approach me through his uncle’s medium I have managed to break up his faction. Outwardly, at least, he is now at one with Muhammad Saleh, the Chief. Without this unification of the clan it was dangerous to have considered the grant of concessions to one particular Sheikh, and was tantamount to putting a premium on the constant restlessness of the Kotaibis and the for all-time insecurity of the trade route. 4. Muhammad Saleh’s allegiance secured, and the tribal section in train of being welded into some vraisemblance of unity, I offered to examine—what till then I had refused to consider—the various grievances Muhammad Saleh had to urge against us. Naturally, he dilated on the loss of crops, and the demolition of houses by our troops. I told him this was the fortune of war; that the fight had been provoked by his people after trying our patience to the last limit. This point Muhammad Saleh now clearly sees, though, Arab-like, he is not going to lose any chance by a failure to represent his case in the largest dimensions.89 D unpunished, nor was their nartieuh ^'h m ^ f ^ ao ^ on Sule ik escaped content to punish the tribe wh i ' r entere ^ by our troops.

Further, the Amir of Dthala is to this day believed by the Kotaibis to nave been the fons et origo of the chastisement meted to them, and unless therelore some settlement is made this sore will remain open and will effectively militate against the better relations between the Kotaibis and the Amir of Dthala; in other words, there will be no security on the roads, and the Kotaibis will be tempted, after our departure, to return to their former reprisals on travellers and caravans. 7. Another^ aim kept constantly before me has been the adjustment of differences betwixt the Kotaibis and the Alawi tribe. On this I shall expatiate below. Suffice it to say, at this juncture, that the equal share in our benefits, qua camels in camp and the supply of kirby, enjoyed by Alawi and Kotaibi' have served to keep alive the idea that both parties had, in our belief, equal pretensions to the ownership of Suleik. This in spite of repeated assurance to the parties that the place was ours so long as we remained there, and that the juxtaposition of the two tribes in close proximity to the fort had induced to ask each to supply a moiety of our requirements. It is in the neighbouring villages of Ath Thumair and A1 Mileh—both originally and principally populated by an offshoot of the Radfan “ Ahl Abdallah, by name Ahl Labjar, that contention has been rife. In return for immunity from taxation at his Customs, the Alawi has been able to exercise certain rights over these villages, e.g., * Timtara, ” which is a certain payment of revenue in kind by the villagers at harvest time, and also “ Dthimd i.e^ the grant of a yoke of oxen to plough the Alawi lands in that vicinity. The Kotaibi Customs —we abolished, hence the feeling which led to the fight; but the Kotaibis are thereby unable to offer corresponding terms to the villagers, who are naturally less inclined to approach them in matters of jurisdiction. In both these villages, there live, besides the original Ahl Labjar, both Alawis and Kotaibis. A Kotaibi aggrieved on any point will throw himself on the Kotaibis 1 conscience and ask redress, and vice versa. Hence the perpetual searchings of heart and bad blood now prevailing around Fort Suleik. I drew up a rough proposal in the presence of both the Sheikhs; and the Amir of Dthala, who was present together with the Radfan Saiyd, took a solemn oath from both sides to adhere in the main to the proposals I had suggested. Naturally I did not go to any great lengths, and studiously avoided any interference which would affect the relative jurisdictions each exercised. I merely asked that existing rights might be recognised ; that differences in the interpretation of these rights might be referred to the Amir and to two local and respected Saiyds; that a wrong committed by a Kotaibi against an Alawi and vice versa should not be met by reprisals hut be referred by theSheikh oE the aggrieved side to Sheikh of the ^? res ®° r ^ “hHs^Sheikh’s dual, or section, or sub-section wlnch r « ^ C °7 t 1 a 1 sk or expre3S l y permit orders, the latter ^^^^The otLr paTrthaUecourse to arms was to be his arrest by the Sheikh of Ji p J j d custodian of the road the avoided in such petty detads tha as a recogn g &lt;T Alawi Sheikh must not ^n KoJaibi caravans to t ave a ng ^ ^ 1 ^ T wrongs, nor \A Ould the I ^ took to tke road ^ way of latter’s subjects we^ at fa^lt that i^ that raids and SSSSS«”.«.»» ‘V.'t.r.T K?JSSTu5S Sra^r was recommended rather than ‘Lrs de force. Both parties agreed to these proposals and since March last no emeute has been recorded. 8 The fire of ill-will still, however, smoulders, and I here propose to detail other causes at work and to suggest a do med™ to relieve the tension. The “ Kotaibi-Alawi-Amiri ” differences are closely ^tedandttoe have attracted my close attention for two years. X trust then they will received with some measure of consideration. 9, This question comprises— (а) The rendition of the country to the Arabs. (б) A stipend to the Kotaibi Chief Muhammad Saleh. (c) An increase of the stipend paid to Sheikh Ah Nasher, the Alawi, 10 As to rendition of lands, the matter is complex One thing is certain viz , that we did not take Suleik from one and gi* 6 i* t® another , we did not give to the Alawi the site on which ‘‘ Dar-al-Kabtan now stands we did not investigate (this was premature) the °wnersh,p of the and at Rnlpik We merely built our fort there and allowed the Alawi to ui d Par to wMch we conMbuted-on what is termed the lands of Al Hamra We told this Sheikh to keep thirty men there to P rote ^ ^ b ^ es » added “ to prevent the Kotaibis or any other persons from levying dues This last clause was unfortunate, hut its inclusion was due P® ? uncertainty of our stay and future role m the Hinterland, and partly to our resentment towards the Kotaibis for their attack on Suleik. ; „ &lt; X have already recommended the demolition both of Fort Suleik and the Dar-al-Kabtan prior to our descent to Aden. I believe there is a® o h _ course open to us. The Amir is the proper person to whom the seomity o this road from Dtbala to Jimil should he committed. He will of ® this portion from the Suleik Habilen to Jinnl to the Kotaibis his ^ildren to protect. If he did not give it, the Kotaihis would take it and wou to he a perpetual thorn in the Amir’s side. Before our arnya ° n . scene, the Kotaihis held the Bahilen, safeguarded along it the telegraph wire when it existed, and were masters of this tract by might if no y • can see no alternative other than to make them responsible to the Amir mr this portion of the road, and to pay a stipend to Sheikh Muhamma through the medium of the Amir, his father. If this is done, it^will e to remove the ‘ Alawi’s Par-al-Kabtan * to his village of ^ Ma baja nea f Jl1 ^ 11 ; The Kotaibis will never remain at peace with the Alawi occupying is which was formerly in the Kotaibi’s possessien. We allowed the ^ Wl f 11 there and we can remove it, as new times demand new measures. , e ^ move along the line of least resistance if we would make for peace and or e . As far as my careful enquiry goes, Saiyid Ali Kidthwan of D was the original owner of all the lands round Suleik. His^ represen a i indeed still lives in the hamlet over Port Suleik. The Amir has cer am undefined rights there. The Kotaibis and Alawi in olden times were suppliers of soldiery and were employed, as occasion demanded, by the ayi of D’thubiyat. The site of the ‘ Dar-al-Kabtan ’ belonged to the same oayia • I fail to discover any just title to its site by the Alawi. The Sheikh as ev *0ti e f n n° Ur / rien( ^» ^ as used our occiupation of Suleik and the ^ranf of the Dar gweu for a s pecifio ohjeet, together with our ill-feelTn^ towfrds tbe otaibis, as a means of innovating various claims on the site of tiuleik These rights he cannot define, nor prove their genesis. 7 686 a nart^^av^fhp round Suieik were originally, then Sayid possessions, though a part, say the Sayids, were endowments from former Amirs. Called m on occasion, as soldiers the Kotaibis, and to a less extent the Alawi have ^ U f e o C f ert t m ri g h ?s i n cuitivation, while Kotaibi villages, e.g., Al’jabha d As Safa, both within a stone’s throw of our present fort, go to suggest the prior claims there of this clan. S (b) i?e a stipend to Muhammad Saleh, the Kotaibi, I have mentioned it above and have from time to time made proposals to that end. I felerto it in my eleventh paragraph, and the closing paragraphs will discuss the Amir’s inability to control the tribesmen. (c) As to Alawi Sheikh's enhancement of stipend, the Resident has his own strong convictions, and I need say no more than reiterate the gam accruing to us by a liberal concession to this most loyal supporter of British influence in the Hinterland. 11. I now touch on road dues, and this introduces the relations of Amir and Kotaibi. Muhammad Saleh has told me that his forbears collected nothing from passers-by. In 1888 before General Hogg, the Resident, this very Muhammad waived his rights to this source of revenue in exchange for the privilege of sending recommendatory letters direct to the Resident at Aden. Subsequently he reverted to his former practices. The Amir, whose pockets were affected by the collection, demurred, and this was what led to our brush with the Kotaibis. Muhammad Saleh admits the innovation was his, but has expressed surprise that so petty an underling as the Beshi Sheikh of A1 Khoraiba (an Amiri adherent and close to Dthala) should be privileged to take dues without being responsible for the safety of the road. That duty falls on the Amir. Further, that the present custodians, the Amir and Alawi are so entitled and both have their Customs to take caravans. The Kotaibi admitting his innovation, and looking to our declared attitude towards his road dues in the past, it would, in my opinion, be a retrogade step now to countenance them (although the Amir might elect to apportion a part of his dues), but a stipend should be given to include the loss of revenue. I must emphatically protest against the idea that the Radfan'are under the Amir in the sense of subordination to him as we understand the term in India. He is their father, and has purely nominal claim to their obedience. He can call them to his standards in war, but they will come only if well paid. They pay no taxes. From these they are from time immemorial immune. They are in short independent ‘ tribesmen * (Kabail) and not subject (rl’aya). The subjects are such as live at A1 Kabar, Zubeid, in the five villages styled Bilad A1 Ashraf-all in the close vicinity of Dthala, while other few villages dotted here and there amid the Shairi villages between Dthala and the Turkish frontier are similarly within this category. 12. When lately summoned to assist the Amir’s arms against the Shairis, the Kotaibis flatly refused compliance but threatened to sack the Amir s villages of At Tafwa and Kharafa (the Amir’s original head-quarters and held in great sanctity) which places lie just off the road leading from Suleik to Dthala. From this piece of folly I think I have dissuaded ^ them. The Amir has many differences of long standing with the Kotaibis. Not alone is he accused of having been the author of their chastisement by us: there exist other differences I have long asked the Amir to settle. He will be obliged to do so when we leave the country. 13. It is one thing then to aim at the consolidation of the Amir s country, but the execution is difficult and quite impossible so long as the Amir relies on 411 our presence and possible assistance to overawe such recalcritrant tribesmen, and himself goes not one step to meet them and arrange a basis for peace. 14. The Turks have fully grasped the lie of the lond and Arab predilections for administration. Our respective conditions are as opposed as the poles. There the country is administered by Turks as it is in British India. There are no independent States or Chiefs. The Sheikships are changed yearly and ( the revenues farmed out to the highest bidder. No one Arab Sheik has superior rights over another, but each tribe has direct relations with the Turkish heads, 6.&lt; 7 ., Kaimmakams and Mutassarif. We have no central controlling administration, but are only supervisors of the various Chiefs. All these have democratic tendencies and object strongly to our system of creating one central head, such as Amir Shaif of Dthala, and expecting all and sundry to bow beneath him. “We are not chiidren of the Amir hut children of the British Government ” is a saying oft in the mouths of the Shairis, Jabal Jihafis, Azrakis and Radfan. Government may kindly consider my remarks in the light of what Upper Yafa reveals. There are some 360 Sultans in Upper Yafa. There is no one or even to commanding figures who can compel obedience of any but a com paratively trifling following. Arabs will not trust Arabs. “ Kullan Sheik Biladihi,” i.e., “ everyone is a Sheik of his own country ” which often means “of his village,” while above all towers the “ Daula ” or British Government. 15. This is, then, the crux, and we must face it as best we can. We seem obliged to adhere to our policy of isolation and non interference in Arab affairs, and must continue to recognise but a minimum of heads with whom to deal. The fact remains that the Arab mind is not educated to this system, nor ever will be, unless the Arab nature is reconstituted. Ergo, we must expect fits of tribal restlessness, and the pendulum will swing between alternate action to interfere (when patience is exhausted) and the sequelae of a restricted supervision. 16.

DeBrath, C B , C.I.E., Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. In forwarding, for the information and orders of Government, copy of a memorandum No. 108, dated the 10th instant, which has been submitted by the Political Agent, Dthala, I have the honour to state that, as I do not believe that any arrangement which may he arrived at will be of a lasting nature unless we remain permanently at Dthala, I do not myself favour any active intervention in Amiri tribal affairs at the present juncture. I am of opinion^ that upon the natural declension of the Amir’s power, tribal affairs will in due course settle down and matters find their own level. And the boundary having been definitely drawn, I do not share Major Jacob’s apprehension in regard to serious Turkish intrigue. 2. As the time for the actual withdrawal of the Political Agent from Dthala is now approaching, I have the honour to invite early consider ation of the proposal referred to in the third paragraph of my letter No. 7601,44 dated the 23rd December 1906, and in the fourth paragraph of my letter No 592 dated the 27th ultimo,*and to state that, subject to the approval of Government, I would now definitely propose that upon Major Jacob’s return to Aden the Suleik Fort and the Dar-al-Quabtan should be dismantled ajid^the. Nobat Dakim post handed over to the Abdali Sultan: the responsibility for the safety of the Aden-Dthala road being then apportioned on the general lines indicated in my letter No. 7487, dated 16th December 1906. ( 3 With reference to the above distribution, I have the honour to state that tiie responsibility for that portion of the road lying between El Mileh and Jimil is shared by the Haushabi Sultan and the Alawi Sheik according to the route taken. In the course of a recent interwiew, the Haushabi Sultan has admitted responsibility from above Nobat Dakim up to Jimil on the road passin 0 * through A1 Mileh to the west of Jabal Manif, and that Aiawi respon* sibilitfes are limited to a portion of the eastern route which lies between Jimil and A1 Ha jar. 4. If the 28th February is decided upon as the date of withdrawal, I have the honour to request that the dismantling of the Suleik fort and of the Dar-al-Quabtan may be approved by cable. No. 108, dated Dthala, the 10th February 1907 (Secret). From—M ajor H. F. Jacob, Political Agent, Dthala, T 0 —The First Assistant Resident, Aden. In continuation of my Secret No. 62 of 22nd January 1907, I would state that our future policy with the Amir of Dthala seems to call for some modifica tion in view of the attitude of his tribesmen to their suzerain. If Government should no longer desire to bolster up the Amir in opposition to the declared will of these tribesmen, it would seem necessary, at any rate, for us to intervene and settle the existing differences, which, if allowed to run their own course, cannot but result in the declension for all time of the Amir’s influence. Such a result would be inexpedient in view of the Treaty by which the Amir is responsible for the safety of the road, to which end we are pledged by this Treaty to render him certain specific assistance. 2. The Amir’s position in this Hinterland is unique. No other Chief has such relations with his tribesmen, both as regards numerical variety, and diversity, both of origin and of characteristic peculiarities. His position is thus of considerable difficulty and he cannot be judged by the standard of other and neighbouring Rulers. ( 3. If it be allowed, as my former minutes have tried to prove, that in bolstering up the Amir’s house we have failed fully to realise the tribal conditions prevailing prior to our advent, and had begun to construct a scheme of consolidation of Amiri rule on lines which, however w’ell approved in India, are clearly unworkable here, we need not, I submit, suffer our work to be utterly effaced now on our departure, but shall more advisedly cover our retreat as best as we can. Our aim should be to work along the line of least resistance. 4. The time is propitious for us to lay aside the bare role of Mentor and to intervene now, or soon after the evacuation to compel the Amir to come to terms with tribesmen who, if not reconciled, will prove a hot-bed for the working of perpetual Turkish intrigue after we reach Aden. 5. There are extant documents passed by Amir Shaif’s predecessor which expressly define the respective rights and duties of the house of the Amir, the Shairis and the Jabal Jihatis. The Amir is averse to disclosing their contents, because, I think, the documents would prove that he w r as using the presence or our troops here to attain an influence far in excess both of the terms of these documents and also of the position he had attained prior to our arrival on the scene.a|f«SS==j£SrS= arrival and in diametrical opposition to Arab predilection I reneat that ihn alternative to consolidation on the former lines, which was in error i consol, 'da? tion in terms of present day demands winch has the people’s imprimatur It IneXSie^h^^r 11 ^ wiU ' P—n?,ldh Z atencewe wm aZt the TnZn, P , Urth0r&gt; , 1 antlcl Pated chronic inter-tribal feud which Se The A mi r ^“ leS !

I have the honour to forward a copy of a memorandum No. 241, dated 23rd March 1907, which has been received from the Political Agent, Dthala, regarding the differences between the Amir of Dthala and certain of his tribes men which have recentlv been brought to notice, and to observe that it appears from this that the Amir of Dthala has at length realised the futility of his former aspirations and methods he has used to realise them. Re appears now to be making a virtue of necessity and is accordingly resolved upon a change of policy which is calculated to lead to the more settled condition of the various districts nominally under his control. ( Secret.) No. 241. Memorandum on. Dth&amp;la affairs. The Amir called to-day and said he had settled all his differences with the Shairis and that there was no likelihood therefore of any further fighting; that the Shairi Akils would return his visit very shortly at Dtbak an R’ le 'T' thereafter bring them to me to witness the final settlement. He said he had taken this particular (and in truth unprecedented) step of approaching the Shairis in person, and of slaughtering two bullocks at their head village.2 ss-L **= because he found that my advice all along had been reasonable and the most likelv to herald peace and good-will; that he had the greatest confidence in mv friendship and had consistently refused to credit the reports lately spread in this place that I was antagonistic to an Amm-Sham rapprochement. Further that he carefully investigated my advice to the Shams and was § convinced that both of us had been steering for one common goal, w conciliation. « . 2. I congratulated Amir Shaif on the policy he had adopted and told him that the credit for this ultimate step lay solely with him, and that I would bring the same to the notice of Government through the Residency; that it, was preferable for him to determine the actual terms of the settlement himself without any intervention on my part, as this was more in consonance with the dignity of his position as Amir and in keeping with the scheme he had just initiated. He pressed, however, for my presence, and so I have agreed. 3. The Amir is now intent on conciliating the Kotaibi tribesmen and Muhammad Saleh, their Chief, in particular. He said that be and I would go shortly to Suleik for this purpose. 4. He was averse, he said, to the entire withdrawal of our troops from Dthala and his country. If, however, we were so determined, he advocated the demolition of Suleik Port and the “ Dar-al-Hamra ” (alias “ Har-al-Qabtan ”), for that otherwise disturbances would be rife there owing to “ Alawi-Kotaibi” jealousies. 5. I asked him about the interlaced lands along the frontier. He explained that not only in the vicinity of Sanah and Kataba but as far down also as “ Ad Dakkam ” (Amiri) this state of affairs prevailed. I should here say that the Kaim Makam of Kataba has lately addressed me from Nadra that he is returning soon to Kataba and would then be glad to meet me on the frontier to discuss the Amir’s complaints in re these inter laced lands. 6. It appears to me that Amir Shaif is at last really solicitous to conciliate his tribesmen. This policy has been evidenced rather late in the day, but has now been given prominence owing, I believe, mainly to his recent humiliation in the fight at the hands of the Shairis. Whatever the motive may have h^en, the result cannot but be gratifying as working for peace and rest between Dthala and the Turkish-Amiri border. It will facilitate materially our with drawal from Dthala. In my opinion, we should wait a little longer to witness the working of this latest denouement, and to see how the Amir will arrange with the hillmen of Jabal Jihaf where the Sheikh Mukbil Nagi still opposes the Amir’s claims. The Amir’s intentions here, too, I believe, are pacific, and I believe some modus vivendi will be shortly reached. The Shams and Jahal Jihafis were under compact jointly to oppose the Amir, but with one party propitiated, and that the most unlikely one to have yielded to suasion—I see no cause for pessimistic ideas any longer on Jahal Jihaf. 7. Other tracts, e.g.^ Ahmedi and Ad Dakkam should then also fall into line. The key to the solution of the problem was the conciliation of the Shams, and therefore, this has been my persistent aim since 1904. 8. We shall not now see the Amir the sole lord of the country. Demo cratic ideas are too deeply embedded in the Arab’s social and political life to allow such a result. One cannot expect to efface so quickly the ill-feeling which, e.g., in the case of the Shairi-Amiri relations has been prevailing for 150 years. There will he, then, no great bonds of sympathy generated between Amir and tribesman; at best, it will he “a transfusion of prejudices”. It may be that friendly independence of the various parts will tend to distri bute the burden of the Amir’s administration and will create a spirit of loyalty throughout them all. Unwilling subjection to a “one man” authority is an Utopian aim, and, if pursued, will checkmate our endeavours to secure peace. ' - 9. If the Kotaihi Chief can he persuaded to settle his differences with the Amir, our stay here will not have been fruitless. For years before our arrival the Amir has been in chronic difficulties with his tribesmen. I heTiuks wore noubtipss t ie prmBipal cause of the situation. With the Turl;s paced behind a delimited frontier, the main work here has been to settle the country internally. The delimitation was a meaningless expression while chaos ' 1Un '.- xt las , been 0Ile constant “ kicking against the pricks ” of _&gt;ab conservatism and contumacy, but the sleeper has at last awakened and ^las justified the policy of adopting a principle and zealously adhering to it.

I f: I i sanctioning provisionally the retention of 300 of the 81st Pioneers as an escort for the Political Agent, D’tiiala, and calling upon me to report: on the nature of the posts to be held in the Hinterland, and their supply; (ii) on the period within which it would be possible to collect supplies ^ ^ and transport in Aden for the relief of the escort should such a ste3p become nece&gt;sary. 2 I have not yet been consult ‘d in regard to the advisability of retaining the Political Agent at D’thala as a temporary measure, after the withdrawal o the garrison. As it is impossible satisfactorily to compress wilbn the limits of a teleoram the reasons which led me to despatch my secret t-legram dated 10th December I take this opportunity of expressing my opinion on the matter so that the Government of India may be under no misapprehension as to what I believe to be the real state of the ease. , 3. Whatever we may wish to believe there is, I think, no doubt that the rule of the Amir of D’thala is, by reason of his weakness^and avarice, unpopular with a large number of the tribesmen over whom he claims control. And in consequence lie holds his position mainly by reason of the support afforded to him by British bayonets. The Arabs of the Hinterland do not w&lt; r &gt;nt us there, and the Amir of &gt; tnala only tolerates our presence jTo long as he requires our support against tne lurks or against his recalcitrant tribesmen. Were he in a position to stand alone he would welcome our departure to-morrow. He has personally and plainly given me to understand this. By the other Chiefs and Sheikhs our presence is tolerated in consideration of the blackmadjwM them to levy from us. The Abdali Sultan alone appears to me to appreciate m some measure the blessings of the Britannica and this is largely due^ to the fact that his subjects are not sufficiently warlike to hold their own against their neighbours. 4 No purely temporary retention of the Political Agent in D thala will remove the causes of the Amir’s unpopularity, nor can the former hope, m the r i course of a few months, to do what we have undoubtedly _ failed to accomplish during the past three years, viz., to consolidate the Amir’s power and render effective the control he claims over certain se ctions of his tribesmen such as the Shairis, Kotaibis and Jihafis The most that the Political Agent can hope to effect is by the offer of good advice to render the Amir more cautions, forbear ing and moderate than he might otherwise be, and possibly his tribesmen might be induced to the less refractory for the moment. Such loss ot prestige as undoubtedly attaches to our withdrawal from the Hinterland will not, m my opinion, be lessened by a merely temporary stay of our 1 olitical cer a I)'thala. On the other hand I regard the retention of a small body o roops (which will not greatly exceed 100 effective bayonets) in H thala n b altog ethe r free from objection on military grounds. Even though not ac ivey emfiloyedTnHhe support of the ' Amir’s authority, we cannot permit n a fighting close to our c imp. It will therefore he impossible in practice or e Political Agent to avoid acting as mediator and he will be obliged personally to intervene to stop or prevent the outbreak of hostilities In such ciicum stances it is quite conceivable that the escort might be called upon to de en itself either against the tribes or the Amir s troops. 5. Assuming however that Government decide on retaining the Agent temporarily in D’thala with the escort I proposed in my telegram a 10th December 1906 I consider the dis ribution should be as follows : In D'thala. —135 bayonets, 2 Maxims, 20 Sabres Aden Troop. In Dthubaiyat . —15 bayonets all ranks. In Suleik. —75 bayonets all ranks. In Nobat Hakim. —75 bayonets all ranks. Owing to the difficulty of maintaining heliographic communication with Aden and in order to control the line of communication and keep the road °P e b y patrolling with Mounted Infantry as now, also to avoid the necessity for sending up a strong escort with the regular supply and treasure convoys, I consi er i necessary to continue to hold Nobat Dakim and Suleik. Our abandonmen o* ■id Suleik i-i quite likely te give rise to trouble between the Kotaihii nnrl ai so I shoull prefer to retain it so long as we are in D’thala. ” a A awis • 6 ; U T c: ’ nside '. tbe suflieienoy of the escort which I propose shouM consist of 135 rifles, 2 machine guns and, for the present, 20 Sabr« Aden It is not easy to forecast the fo ce with which one might be obliged to d^ Tn Dthala at shorl notice, but I consider 400 or 500 riflemen is probably a fairly liberal approximation. I do not propose the retention of the two guns of the camel battery as there is a great, temptation to use them, as we haye already done (Residency No. 5039, dated the 24th August 1906) and being manned by European gunners they greatly increase the difficulties of supply. The Maxim guns on the other hand are more than the equivalent of another 50 Infantry and should be retained. I have arranged that the entire force shall be located in a properly defensible enclosure, but its water supply will necessarily be at some distance from the post. * .y uc * 1 , 7. Should it by any chance happen that the escort required relief from Aden I calculate that it might ha^e to support itself for 14 days before a column ot 500 men and four guns could reach D’thala. The collection of carriage and supplies would take possibly five days and the march up, which, on account of water difficulties, must be performed in two detachments, would require six days more. ^th- Telegram No. S.-28, dated the 10th January 1907.

Please see last paragraph Foreign Department telegram No. S.-193, of 22 nd December. Aden policy. Secretary of State directs following general instruc tions be issued for guidance of Political Officer, D’tbala. Instructions begin. It is the intention of His Majesty’s Government that the Political Officer should be withdrawn from D'thala as soon as local conditions will permit, and that frontier affairs should then be .dealt with by means of occassional visits to D’thala when required. Political Officer should therefore understand that it is his duty to conduct affairs so as to facilii ate his early withdrawal and to minimise its effect when it takes place. His dealings with the Turkish autho rities, with the Amir and his subjects, and with otlier sections of the tribes should he governed by above consideration. He should furnish as soon as practicable a report as to date when withdrawal will be possible, and as to means of conducting frontier affairs after withdrawal. He is to avoid any step likely to lead to politic d or Military entanglements and to adhere to the policy of non-interference with the internal and domestic policy of tribes. He may discuss affairs of secondary importance with local Turkish authorities when necessary, hut must be circumspect in dealing with complaints and careful not to exaggerate such incidents as may occur. He may assist the Itesident in peaceful settlement of intertribal disputes, so far as this can he done without involving entanglement in purely tribal affairs, hut must refer specially for orders any case which appears to call for active intervention. Instructions End. The Secretary of State further observes that while adhering to treaty obligations he desires to discourage activity to interfere in Upper Yaffai affairs, and that everything will depend on the Resident and the Political Officer appreciating the intention of His Majesty’s Government to withdraw from D’thala and act accordingly.

Confidential. c ^. &lt;Iie 1 „ 5 t J 1 and synchronously with the Resident’s arrival in Dthala, at tMc^n 8 ° f the Atmr &gt; together with the people of Al Kabar (Amiri), stopped t tins village a convoy of camels carrying rations from one of our camps to another. The Amin soldiers claimed an illegal tax (as the Amir afterwards admitted) from these camelmen, all of whom were Shairi-Amiri, and in the ensuing brawl a prominent man, the Akil of “ Hazat-al-Khulaki ” (Shaid), was shot dead. After a great deal of persuasion I induced both parties to cease ring. Ihe ^ Sl^ri-Amiri relations have been strained for years, and just prior 0 my assuming charge in November 1904, a Jalila man (Shairi) had been killed m light by the Amiri soldiers. These two deaths the Shairis have been clamouring to avenge in accordance with the demands of the “ lex talionis.*’ 1 hough averse to interfering in tribal disputes, I felt bound to intervene at the present time, for, quite apart from the vicinity of our camps to the scene of their operations, I had long since gauged the situation and had seen that the Amir’s fogs were chiefly oL.his own tribesmen, and that sent here to &lt; ive the Amir moral support, it was incumbent on me to try by every means to bring the parties to some amicable settlement. To tin's both the Amir and the chairi Akils in part, were outwardly agreeable. Since the said 15th July, I have striven to achieve my end, but owing to the presence of a few evil spirits amongst the Shairis, and also, I regret to say, to frequent ill-conceived inter ference on the Amir’s part, I had only a week ago told the parties! must with draw from the position of arbitrator. The Shairi were told by me that I was hound to uphold the Amir their suzerain, and, so if they made a wanton attack on him in the vicinity of our camps, I should be obliged actively to interfere; that if they would retaliate quietly on the principle of “an eye for an eye ”, I should say nothing. They promised not to disturb the peace of the country and left the conference. On the 15th instant, at 10 a m., advancing in many bands, the Shairis niade an unprovoked attack on Al Kabar. I sent word to the Amir to stop his men participating, and this he certainly at first did to a remarkable degree. I further sent 2 messengers to the Jalila people and Akils of the Shairis, reminding them in express terms of the consequence of a continuance of theI! ' &gt;«• _ . , a flip fi(rhtin ( * became more determined, and I saw that fig M : Sa was bec^lni critical, the Shams being out in force, while theAmirs posit had not time to rally his men from the distncts. the Amir, taken y P , , t t two guns, thinking by this means I asked ’earnestness. I then proceedld myself to the t0 he thSnd a-ain despatched a messenger to inform the Shairi scene of the fighting ana a a p in i an hour&gt; 5 £ the people were not leaders that Jalila wouWbe^ouro^ ^ ^ extra grace&gt; tlie 0 .

TMs had an exc lent effect and dispersed the fighters-the terrain being trans- ■ f lS tn the neighbouring hills, the Shairis taking up a position on' one- boulder Ml ' while the Amiris were on the range between that and the cemetery • hm The Shairis did most of the shooting, the Amms responding but fitfully,, just to prevent a Shairi rush. •MV m^sen^er returning from the Shairi leader said the latter’s objective was Errand if I chose Mfire on Jalila, it was God’s will TMs message I received before we commenced firing. After an interval another shell was put down to the West of Jalila and another to the South and short of the village. The village was now practically deserted. As the flighting continued, the Shairis having worked round towards the tsj Ti'a C f nf^Dfhala I had at intervals, 6 shells launched, 4 over Jalila and town itLlf The effect was excellent and for a time the fighting c^ef nmceedMg a wMlc in a desultory way. The guns were then withdrawn. At the same time the Amiri soldiers on the “ Hog s back were replaced by British troops. The Amir begged me to interfere still more, for he was apprehensive for the safety of Dthala town. His men, too, lacked ammunition. I told Mm he should send for reinforcements, and if the Shairis were too strong for him, I would afford the requisite co-operation: that he was bound to display h capabilities in accordance with the treaty obligations, our co-operation that day being more to signify Government’s displeasure and their determina to support the Amir who was not the aggressor in the fight. I was extremely averse to participate, as I feared a complete set-back to the work of twenty months of attempted reconciliation, but my action w absolutely imperative. The effect on the Shairis was magical. The people returned that evening, and in convocation sent me word that they did not wish to prolong hosUl t , were friends of Government, and did not believe their action would have proved so distasteful to me (sic). Yesterday I visited Jalila with Major Koe and convened all the Shairi Akils. I also visited the town and was shown the spots where the t wo s burst No damage was done to life or property. The Sham relations with mvself have even improved and doubtless, from what 1 have seen, and £ conversation with Shairis and others in my walks inthe Sham conn . an4 to-day, I am convinced that this and this alone will tend to re -assaults in future improbable. To threaten punishment and then re ®® de J. , my threat would have weakened the hold I have over these P® 0 ? 6 w . , , me, and not the Amir, as their father and counsellor. To have , drastic a threat would have spelt chronic disturbance and our arrival s&amp;on y an impasse. , , Another prime factor impelling me to resort to forceful tactics on nesday was that the lately murdered Shairi was of “ Shaib extrao the village had appealed to Sheikh Ali Mohsin, “ the pillar-breaker, Mausatta (Upper Yaffa) which hold Shaib in appanage, for redress ot 'wrongs.

Major Jacob writes that the Amir of D’thala is again haying trouble with some of his tribesmen on Jibal Jehaf. I referred to this in the third paragraph of my weekly letter dated the 13th October last. On that occasion that matter was one of revenue collection. On the present occasmn the Jihafis are opposing the arrest of a criminal who recently murdered a Turkish, subject in Amiri territory close to the border. The Kaimmakauy has asked that justice may be done, and the incident is of general importance than the dispute which occurred iu October last. Major Jacob says t at tbe Amir is likely to appeal to us for assistance, as he fears trouble with his Shairi tribesmen as well as with the Jihafis. I am telling him la i the Amir actually does appeal for assistance, he should report the fact at once and that meanwhile he should confine himself to giving sue a vice ^ 6 Amir and to his tribesmen as may tend to establish better relations between them. At the same time, I would here add that Government ^Id now be prepared to pass early orders in the event of ^ ^Mt^^peahug wLL assistance. He has himself to thank for trouble with the Jihafb, 3841 F.

The Kaimmakam of Kataba has accused a subject of the Amir of D’thala, living in Hazat al ’Abid and close to the frontier, of the murder of a Turkish subject. He has written to me and called for reparation, as failing this, fresh incidents must occur to mar the security of the border. 2. I have pressed the Amir to give early reparation, and this he has undertaken to give, but uses the occasion to remind me of the many 'unsettled claims he has made through me against Turkish subjects. 3. These claims I have duly forwarded to Kataba for settlement and report, but owing, in the main, to repeated changes of Kaimmakams and also to the chaotic state of the country across the border, because of the feud with the Iman, it has been left to the present incumbent, an Arab of promise, to afford satisfaction, which indeed he has engaged to do. 4. I have assured the the Kaimmakam, Kataba, of the Amir’s determina tion to decide “ the Haza affair ” in terms of Arab custom, approved on both sides the line, but have invited his attention to the early settlement of the Amir’s long outstanding grievances.

Similar principles apply to criminal matters, and provided that there is not too great a readiness to interfere, and that due care is exercised not to attach an exaggerated importance to the incidents which arise, there would seem to be no objection to the general proposition that the Political Agent, D’thala, should occasionally address the Kaimmakam of Kataba with a view to the administration of justice without the delay entailed by reference to Constantinople, and should also advise the Amir of D’thala to administer good justice in those cases which come before him for trial. 4.

In reply to your conSdential No. 7331 of 9th December 1906, I have the honour to state that this is no matter for extradition. No such demand has been preferred by the Kaimmakam, nor does my No. 1330 touch on anything but the Turkish official’s request for reparation. 2. The criminal is an Amiri subject of Hazat ul Abid: the place of crime was Amiri territory: the murdered man was a Turkish subject. 3. The Amir has promised to arrest the man and try the case, but urged the unsuitability pf the occasion now that the tribes in the vicinity were opposed to him. I have not, therefore, insisted on the immediate arrest, and have informed the ^aimmak^m that the necessary retribution will follow in due course. 4. I am informed that the trouble with Jebal Jihaf is likely to be patched up, and as the Amiris now intent on dealing with Shairis only, it is better that the “ Haza affair ” should be temporarily dropped.

The Amir further said in his letter that the deceased had some money due to him from one Hamid. To a letter dated 27th Rajab 1324 (i.e., 16th September 1906) the Amir attached a chit from a third party which goes to gi ve the lie to the letter from the Kaimmakam, whose letter is dated 13th Rajab 1324 (i.e., 2nd August 1906). In it he says that Musleh Suhail ignores the charge, and further asks that the aggrieved party may be sent to Kataba to confront the accused. The Amir was sent copy of Kaimmakam’s letter and was asked to do the needful. In a letter dated 27th Rajab 1324 (i.e., 16th September 1906) the Amir engaged to send me the aggrieved party, but hitherto has failed.

On arriving at Shakhab Custom House (near Kataba) the owner was arrested, and his camel without apparent cause was taken away from him. In a letter, dated 4th Ramadthan 1324 (i.e., 22nd October 1906 ), the Amir reported that in retaliation for the loss of their camel Bani al Gamma! bad carried away two camels belonging to Sayid Abdul Qader of Kataba. No Turkish cross-complaint has been received. “F.” The Amir in a letter, dated 11th Shabam (i th September 1906), peti- oned me that the Custom-House soldiers of Shakhab (near Kataha) had tken away by theft from Ali Hasan al Hadali and his party $8.

XXe affected surprise, saying that the interrelations of Shairis and IVXuresis were of long standing. He seemed to be unable to grasp the new condition of affairs since the border was delimited. 3. The Amir has not succeeded in enlisting the tribes as fully as he expected, but I hear that some of the Halmin people, and the Hijaili section of the Itadfau have joined his forces. 4. In the meantime I have again impressed upon the Amir that no fighting will be permitted in tbe vicinity of our camps. 5. Many independent Peace Parties are endeavouring to secure a reconci liation. The Shairis have assured me they will not attack the Amir, but are preparing merely for defence, so as not to be taken unawares. 6. The Amir’s action is inexplicable. I have called on him to explain. He left me the other night after begging me to approach the Shairis with a view to a reconciliation, and he there and then clearly waived all his claims against them. ' ■ He then changed front and hurried off to enlist recruits, so that my mission in consequence failed. 7. Unable to fight in the neighbourhood, both parties will be forced to disband ,their mercenaries, and it is best, in my opinion, to watch and do nothing*. 8.

I have no objection to general scope of instructions to Political Officer, Dtliala, except that, while adhering to treaty obligations, I desire to discourage any active interference in Upper Yaffai affairs. Everything will depend on Resident and Political Officer appreciating the intention of His Majesty’s Government to withdraw from Dthala and acting accordingly. I would therefore substitute for the first sentence of the instructions ending with words “ other sections of the tribes,” and for the passage beginning “and to conduct affairs” and ending “when it takes place, ’ the following:—“ It is the in tention of His Majesty’s Government that the Political Officer should be withdrawn from Dthala as soon as local conditions will permit, and that frontier affairs should then be dealt with by means of occasional visits to Dthala when required. Political Officer should therefore understand that it is his duty to conduct affairs so as to facilitate his early withdrawal^ and to minimise its effect when it takes place. His dealings with the lurkish authorities, with the Amir and his subjects, and with other sections of the tribes should be governed by the above consideration.

From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army Departmen t. 11th December 1906. P.— The question of the strength of the garrison at Aden tcill shortly he considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence. It is represented by the TVar Office that the retention of a battalion of British Infantry is dis advantageous both from the point of view of Army organisation and that of the training of the troops and their comfort. A very considerable reduction of the fixed armament is recommended by General Owen's Committee. It is understood that the Admiralty do not consider the place to be liable to serious attach; and that under present conditions a small proportion only of the existing movable armament is necessary. It is proposed by the War Office that the following should be reduced ; the whole battalion of British Infantry, one company of Garrison Artillery, the section of Submarine Miners and one battalion Native Infantry ; and it is considered that, in the event of it being desired to retain the second Native regiment and the company of Artillery, they should be looked upon as mobile troops available for service in the interior and not as forming part of the garrison. Blease let me have, as soon as practicable, your views on the obligatory garrison proposed, and on the force required for the Hinterland, in view of the policij recently laid down by His Majesty's Government, the force for the Hinterland being regarded as distinct from the garrison of Aden itself.([ L &lt;r‘ ; it i on ' No. 7336. dated Bombay Castle, the 80th October 1906. From-The Hon'bie Sir Sraroraa W. Edgkrley, K C V O 0 T F Cb;«f q'; to the Government of Bombay, Political Department ' lrf To-The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, copy ot a confidential letter from the Political Resident A 3 , 6267, dated the 21st October 1906 reporting an attaX^mhambS tribe on a small party of men belonging to the King’s Own Scottish Borderers who were proceeding from Dtbala to Aden. 2. I am at the same time to state that any remarks which the Bombay Government may desire to make on these papers will be submitted to the Government of India hereafter. No. 6267, dated Aden Residency, the 21st October 1906. From Major-General E. DkBrath, C.B , C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident, Aden, To—The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, that a small party of 8 men of the King’s Own Scottish Borderers was fired upon by some Dthambari tribesmen, on the evening of the 4th instant, whilst proceeding from Dthala to Aden. The incident took place a few miles above Nobat Dakim, and is reported by the Political Agent, Dthala, to have been due to tribal dis affection against the Haushabiand the Abdali Sultans. The firing took place in the dusk of the evening, and resulted in one private of the King’s Own Scottish Borderers being slightly wounded in the chest, and a camel-driver accompanying the party being wounded in the leg. 2. In reporting this incident for the information of Government, I have the honour to draw attention to the fact that it is one of a series of similar incidents which have now for some time past interrupted the peace of the trade routes, and the safety of our own communications with the Dthala sanitarium, and in regard to which, it seems to me desirable, that some definite line of action should now be adopted with the least possible delay. 3. Paragraphs 106 to 116 of General Maitland’s report, of the 12th June ($i)04, on the recent demarcation of the frontier, refer to some of the troubles experienced by the Boundary Commission at the hands of the Dthambari and the Kotaibi tribes ; and the reports which have emanated from this Besidency concerning the troubles which have been experienced in regard to the Subehi tribes have been numerous and constant. 4. Taking the year 1906 alone, several incidents have occurred, and con tinue to occur, which are of considerable local importance, and in regaid to which it is every day becoming more important that a firmer and more definite policy should be adopted and pursued. 5. The attack on the Nohat Dakim post reported in this office letter No. 381, dated the 21st January 1903, was, as is the case in the present instance, :he result of tribal disaffection against either the . Sultan ® Haushabi Sultan, or both. The postal robbery reported in this office letter No. 382, dated 21st January 1906, was similarly mainly the result of tubal dis iffection against the Abdali Snltan. In July last, an attack was made by certain Subehis f th ® G ^ al ®p a upon a herd of cattle which was being taken to Dthala by Unfits meat contractor, in which 22 head of cattle were looted m Haushabi limits, &lt;5 tt, 4 1 ° v/*fj C395FDimd in regard to which a claim for compensation of Rs. 610 is now outstanding against the Haushahi Sultan. This attack also was probably mainly due tf.) disaffection against the Haushahi. On the 8th September last, a caravan was attacked by the same clan on its way from Mavia to Lakej. And quite recently our post at Suleik has been fired into on three occasions, and the Political Agent, Dthala, reports that these incidents also are probably due to the tribal disaffection of certain of the Radfan trikes against the Haushahi and the Abdali Sultans. ° * 6. The affair reported in this office letter No. 6039, dated the 24th August was of course purely the result of tribal disaffection against the Amir of Dthala. ^ 3 - \ 7. In brief, practically all the incidents which have of late disturbed the peace of that portion of the Protectorate with which our relations are most intimate, have been due inthemainto tribal disaffection against one or more of the three rulers named, the Abdali, the Haushabi, or the Amir of Dthala. And the fact that we have ourselves suffered annoyance is due to the desire of the tribes concerned to thus attract a greater measure of attention to their grievances, whether real or imaginary. 8 At the same time all the incidents referred to, with the exception perhaps of the Sheikh Othman postal robbery case, are matters which should actually be dealt with by the rulers concerned, who, under the terms of their treaties, are hound to secure the safety of the roads leading to Aden. 9. Up to the present time practically no effective action has been taken by those rulers, either to punish the offenders or to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. On the other hand, the inadequate measures which they have taken have served only to accentuate the disaffection which has caused them. 10. As an instance of the action taken, I would mention that, after the Subehi attack on the caravan proceeding from Mavia to Lahej last month, there was great talk of a joint expedition by the Haushabi add the Abdali to punish the offenders. Upon the Haushabi Sultan’s special request for assist ance, I presented him with 200 rounds of ammunition and a Durbar present of Rs. 500. The result was the interchange of a few shots which led to no casualties on either side, and which were promptly followed by negotia tions conducted by the Abdali leaders. As to these, Major Jacob reports that the Haushabi Sultan was much incensed against the Abdali, “ who had only accentuated the feud between the Haushabi and Subehi while secur ing himself against the marauders,” and that the Haushahi Sultan was parti cularly exasperated because it was at the Abdali’s instance that the Subehi were in the first place attacked. 11. The futility of such measures as these, and the mischievous effect of such half-hearted and ineffective reprisals have been frequently represented by this Residency, and are referred to in some detail in Captain Hancock’s memorandum, which accompanied this office letter No. 1150, dated 25th Uebruary 1906. The references made in paragraphs 23 and 24 of that memorandum to the arguments adduced by Colonel Merewether forty years ago are still relevant to the existing condition of affairs in the Aden hinterland. And at the present day the actual benefits which we derive from the various stipends and presents which are disbursed to the Chiefs of this Protectorate, are practically no more than they were in the days when the enrolment of the Aden troop was first sane-' tioned by His Majesty’s Government. 12. In my letter No. 3419, dated the 9th June 1906, I have already made certain proposals to Government, the adoption of which I am convinced can alone provide an effective remedy to the evils referred to. And I would recommend that these may now receive the earliest possible consideration. 2 j13. 1 cajii assure Goverumenf flmf t • T^y interfere with the internal and domestic “£ 1 . aten * i&lt; ’J' 0 f desire to in any &lt;mn be avoided, and that the measures which I hlvpV f the , tribes &gt; w ^re this such as would, in the end, prove the e most C effectivr pr0p0sed are in opinion rebruaryiaFt, there P isa 4 refereM?to W thfnet C0 rel!lt m f mOraQ H Um ° f the 22ud Majesty’s Government.

It is difficult for Government to realise the intense interest with which our present policy is being observed in the hinterland of this Protec orale or vhe actual effect of such events as the long immunity of the murderer of the late Captain Warneford, and also of the petty tribe which so insolently robbed His Majesty’s mail last spring. * *uuueu ms The Abdali Sultan has more than once asked me why we do not punish offenders, and nas offered pointed remarks on the manner in which we treat well and iU-behaved alike. He has protested his inability to effectively punish the Subehis without our assistance, and has more than once asked me to support mm^with the Aden troop, on the ground that he is acting, or desires to act, in the interest of Government. I have refrained from acceding to his request as I am aware that proposals of this nature are not likely to he welcomed by His Majesty’s Government at the present time, but such assistance cannot be in definitely postponed, and the result of withholding it may be seen in the abortive expedition described in paragraph 10 above. 17. The tribesmen and their Chiefs of course see that, where formerly prompt action would have been taken by the Aden troop, either with or with* out the co-operation of friendly neighbours, there is now delay and of late practically no action at all. And so long as the Political Resident continues unable to exercise his own immediate discretion in regard to the measures which are needed to repress petty cases of disorder that from time to time arise, and for the present must continue to arise, there is little doubt that there will certainly be no decrease in the number of these unpleasent incidents. 18. I would here state that the area affected by the above remarks is limited, and there are portions of this Protectorate where any sort of interven tion continues at present quite unnecessary. The area affected however is more considerable than what is known on the Somali Coast as the ten-mile limit, and includes the greater part of the western portion of the Protectorate which is traversed by the main trade routes entering Aden from Ottoman territories. To the north and east there is no present necessity for intervention. The Padthli Sultan, who was formerly our most tiresome enemy, is now a peaceable neigh bour, and though disputes between him and the Lower Yaffai may again arise to give cause to some unrest, it is not probable that this will be of a nature to seriously affect Aden. 3IQ It is on the Dthala road, and on the other main routes which lie to %e west of that, that unrest is least to be desired and has of late been most notice. :, |p * ud ’ it is m ost particularly in regard to these that I would again press upon Government the desirability of firmer measures. A wa in 0 n the western littoral, measures both to repress disorder and to check the mischievous traffic in arms have of late appeared necessary. 20 Reverting now to the particular incidents reported in the commence ment of this letter, I have the honour to state that, with the approval of Gov ernment, I propose to take the following measures. 21 The Dthambari tribe are the most southerly of the Radfan tribes which owe allegiance to the Amir of Dthala, and of late years have been con- sidered as nominally under the Haushabr Sultan, but neither of these Ch.efs really control them. Nevertheless I propose to press both the Amir of Dthala, on the ground of nominal suzerainty, and the Haushahi Sultan within whose limits the outrage took place, to undertake their correction. And m view of his agreement of 1895 with the Haushabi Sultan referred to in correspondence end- inz with your letter No. 7605, dated 25th November 1905,1 propose to also press the Abdali Sultan to co-operate with the Haushabi m view of the latter portion of clause VIII of that agreement. 22. I propose to 'ive the Chiefs concerned clearly to understand that I look to them to take effective measures both to punish this tribe and to ensure better order in future, in virtue of their treaty obligations, and m consideration of. the stipends which they receive, 23 Amongst other measures, I propose to press the Haushabi to establish such further posts on the road, and to maintain such additional forces as may be required, to more effectively safeguard travellers. 24 And lastly I propose to press the Haushahi Sultan for payment to the Government meat contractor of the compensation which I have already referred to, and for which he is liable under Article VI of his agreement of 1895 with the Abdali Sultan. 25 And I would at the same time solicit immediate sanction to the present ation, to the Haushabi Sultan, of the 50 rifles and the 1,000 rounds of ammuni tion already recommended in paragraph 5 of my letter Iso. &lt; 419, dated the 9th June 1906, and the earliest possible consideration of the urgent desirability or increasing his stipend as also there suggested. 26 In my opinion the corrective effects of the action I here propose will he doubly lasting, if I am permitted to support the forces of the Abdali ; and Hau- shabi with the Aden Troop. This support would he moral and passive so long as possible, but active if circumstances demanded it. I urge this course pe- cause it would enable me to make certain that the action taken by the bhieis concerned was serious and as effective as their means permitted, and, se ^°P because I believe that the moral effect of their tribesmen being supported by Government troops would be great. It is in my view most important that we should let offenders see that the bigger Chiefs are acting with the full support and approval of Government, and that we do not intend to permit murder ana pillage on the trade routes. 27. To these proposals I have the honour to request that the sanction o Government may, if possible, he accorded and transmitted by telegraph, as, Q earlier action is taken the more effective is it likely to be. Extracts from the weekly letters of the Political Resident at Aden, dated, respectively, the 13lh and 20th October 1906. ******* 4. There has been another outrage on the Hthala road : a small party of the K. O. S. B’s being sniped at near Isobat Dakim on its way down to Aden. 4o^the K. O. S. B’s was slightly wounded in the chest and a eamel-driver in the leg. The olfenders are said on this occasion to have been certain Dthambaris who took this way of expressing their dissatisfaction with the Haushabi Sultan who appears to have, in their opinion, insufficiently rewarded them for recent assistance against the Jabhera clan of Subaihis. I have told Major Jacob that the Haushabi Sultan should be at once pressed to substantially punish the offenders and preserve better order. And if that Chief takes no effective action, I shall, in reporting the incident officially, recommend that his stipend be withheld. 5. The Attifi Sheikhs are said to be now at Lahej endeavouring to make c onditionsfor the surrender of the offenders concerned in the Sheikh Othman Postal robbery. I am informing the Abdali Sultan that the surrender must be unconditional, but that due consideration will be paid to anything that may be urged in their defence and to any representation that he may have to make on their behalf. There is said to have been some friction between the Turan and the A1 Kadthi party. But both parties are said to be now represented at Lahej t 8. Major Jacob is making enquiries into the recent attack on the party of K. 0. S. B’s referred to in paragraph 4 of my last week’s letter and being reported officially by this mail. He is inclined to think that one or two dis contented Haushabi subjects took part in the attack as well as the Dthambaris. The Haushabi has recently had differences with some of his kinsmen at A1 Baba and imprisoned some of them, and it seems quite possible that this has some bearing on the incident. G. 0. Pr«.
