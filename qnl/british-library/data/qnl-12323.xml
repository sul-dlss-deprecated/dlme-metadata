The Captain also makes a number of commendations for troops that have rendered especially useful services in maintaining, and later removing the garrison from Ras al Khyma, with a special mention for Lieutenant Macdonald.The Captain explains that the garrison has been landed at Deristan, as per the recommendations of Captain Lock of HMS
                           Eden, which were supported by Captain Maillard; he also responds to claims that other sites would have been better suited.The author is writing from Masket [Muscat] due to recommendations from medical officers that he should take to sea due to ill health.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023711596.0x000008#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
