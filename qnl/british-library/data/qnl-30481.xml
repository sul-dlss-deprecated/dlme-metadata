OFFICE OF THE POLITICAL RESIDENT, PERSIAN GULP', CAMP, KUWAIT, the 14th March 1947. Reference to previous correspondence: DESCRIPTION OF ENCLOSURE Letter No.Ext.8592/47 dated 4th March 1947, from the India Office to the Government of India. SUBJECT : PERSIAN GULF LIGHTING SERVICE. ^7(deceived under India Office printed letter No.Ext.8529/47 dated 4th March 1947). INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, Ext. 8529/47 LONDON, S.W.1. £ March ? ' '1947 Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the proposed transfer to H.M.G-. of direct administrative control and consequent expenditure in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf and in Muscat and to state that H.M.G. would at the same time wish to take up with the Government of India the question of the future of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. 2. The Persian Gulf buoys and lights were originally established by British efforts and were maintained by the British-India Steam Navigation Company at their own expense. The Secretary of State understands that in about 1911 the existing buoys and lights were, at the suggestion of H.M.G., taken over by Government at a valuation estimated in advance as £1,000, to be divisible equally between British and Indian revenues. (Of this estimated sum, however, only £855 was paid, the remainder being deducted on account of buoys found to be missing on their being taken over from the B.I.S.N. Company.) It was at the same time arranged that the cost of future administration, which was to be performed by the Royal Indian Marine should also be equally divisible between British and Indian revenues. In 1925 &amp; further •hange in administration was decided on, the service being thenceforward run b the Government of India on a self-supporting basis, funds being obtained from dues charged on all vessels calling at Basra and Jbadan, H.M.G., however, made a grant of £5,00J a year for 5 years to cover any deficit that might arise during the first few years of the fund’s existence as a .self-supporting service. 3. Lord Pethick-Lawrcheunsorstands that the present position is that the Government of India is responsible for the operations of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, the administration being carried out by the Nautical Adviser to the; Government of India acting v/ith the assistance of a non-official dvisory Committee of Shipping at Bombay; while the port Director, Basra, carries out, on behalf of the Service, the maintenance and upkeep of its lights and buoys, as well as the collection of port dues at Basra and Abadan. 4. In view of recent developments a review of the present arrangements now seems in any *#ase to be desirable. The development of the operations of the Arabian-4meriean Oil Company in Saudi Arabia, the Koweit Oil Company at Koweit and Petroleum Concessions Limited in Qatar have given rise to increasing oil tanker traffic not calling at Basra or Abadan, and it will be necessary to provide ior suitable contributions to be made by the respective Companies otherwise than by the collection of port dues at Basra and Abadan. It is understood that arx^angements have in fact been made with the Arabian-American Oil Company and the Bahrein Petroleum Company ior contributions covering recent years, but that these arrangements are not regarded as altogether satisfactory and will need revision tor the future. 5. In connection with the proposal that they should now assume direct administrative control in the Persian Gulf, H.M.G. consider it appropriate that they should themselves take ov«r from the Government of India responsibility for the control and administration of the Persian Gulf The Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi. Lighting/Lighting. Service. H.M.G would propose that the Service should be placed under the supervision of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and that the Advisory Committee should in future sit at Bahrein. Provision would be made for the representation on that Committee of any Indian shipping interests and, if desirable, other commercial interests that may be concerned. Bahrein would appear in present conditions the most suitable place for the location of the Advisory Committee in view of its central situation in the Persian Gulf, the facility of its cotnmunications, and the cornparative ease of arranging for the representation there of Oil Companies operating in the Persian Gulf area. 6. If the Government of India agree in principle with this proposal, H.M.G. would be glad if they could be furnished with a detailed statement of the present assets of the Persian Gulf Lighting \ Service both in respect of the equipment and the cash balance which, it is assumed, would pass with the transference of control. 7. The Secretary of State would be glad to receive the observations ^ of the Government of India on this matter at an early date.

Thompson, for Port Officer. -- 0 O 0 -- 1st September, 1947 AIR HAIL No.7/PlC/5/S32 In continuation of my cable dated IGtn August, l^ni copy of which is attached for your ready -reference I would add the following observations:- Although the request is ’or the light to be established at^Ras-Al-Hadd it is presumed there would be no . objection to it being a few miles away, say wherever a conyemer and natural elevation can be found. Tnis because to obtain 15 miles range the light would need an elevation of some ^0 feet and such a high costly structure is to be avoided if possible. ' As this light will be on lee shore it is considered essential that a radio beacon be installed in addition to the light. The Political Resident is being asked to obtain the necessary permission for a survey of the area to be carried out. Sd/- C.E. Thompson, for Port Officer. Copy to the HCr;’ ?LE THl.

Minimum height ninety feet is desirable. If radio beacon is to be established which is also considered desirable this will materially increase cost. Suggest you give authority to survey site to give final estimate of cost. RIVERPORT9/30 Telegram From To G • T, C • H.M’s. Consul, ITuscat, H.H. the Sultan of Muscat', at Salalah. (through R.A.F.

PT/H.694/47 3rd September, 1947 Your Ref. Ext.1568/47 Dear Mr. Harrison, Please refer to your letter of 21st August addressed to Mr. -Glenister about the proposal to establish a light on Ras-Al-Hadd. Ras-al-Hadd is the eastermost point of Arabia, 90 miles sbu£h eastward of Muscat and 280 miles from the entrance to the Persian Gulf. We are advised that there is undoubtedly a need for a light on this point, which must be rounded £y all ships proceeding to the Persian Gulf from the Gulf of Aden and the coast'of East Africa; it is also the point of landfall of vessels from India and the Far East. There is are no lights on the Arabian Coast between Muscat and Aden a stretch of nearly 1,200 miles, except for a small unreliable light of Makalla about 800 miles south westward of Ras-al-Hadd. We feel some difficulty, however, in entertaining the view that such a light should form part of the Persian Gulf Light Service. Although we are not aware that any precise limits of jurisdiction have been fixed for the P.G.L.S., were that Service to establish and maintain a light at Ras-Al-Hadd their responsibilities would extend a further 90 miles to the sc south eastward and nearly S 300 miles from the entrance to the Persian Gulf. This might create an awkward precedent, and should there be demands for other lights on the Arabian Coast, which would also be only of assistance to the Persian Gulf traffic, the P.G.I.S. might be asked to bear the cost of establishing and maintaining them. The relief of, lighthouses in such isolated $ spots would, I should imagine prove both difficult and costly. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Dodds at the Admiralty. ’LB’ Yours sincerely, (Sgd) Margaret ChurchardHEADQUARTERS, PORT DIRECTORATE.
