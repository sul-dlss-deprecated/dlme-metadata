Bahrain, 6th January 1945. f | \B My dec.r Jir Geoffrey, x M \ d Please refer to the correspondence ending with my telegram No.414 dated the 4th May 1944. 2. On the 4th January Anderson the General Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company came to see me about various matters concerning his Company. He wqs very worried because he had recently had runours brought to his notice suggesting that there was dis-se-.t. 4 sfaction among the local employees of the Company which might result in another strike. Nothing 'concrete could be quoted but he thought that there was no doubt that labour was disturbed and he wished to obtain my advice with regard to what action could be taken to prevent matters becoming more serious. 3. The Company expect to complete the Catelytic TXuit by the 1st of April and should then be able to discharge approxi mately 2,000 of their coolies. The whole construction under taking should be completed by the 1st of June with the result that a further 1,500 unskilled labourers will be set free by that date. The v/ork has already been retarded by circum stances over which the Company had no control and the pressure on them to complete the various units by the now scheduled dates is very considerable, so that they view with much alarm any prospect of their operations being brought to a stand still or even delayed by labour disputes. Anderson informed me that they were prepared to go a long way to keep their labour at work and he was prepared to recommend to his Board substantial difficult increases in pay. After the next_ninety days he anticipated that the control of labour would be in the employers 1 hands as they would be discharging and not enlisting workmen. Hon*ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., ^ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.'H: mj CONFIDENTIAL D • 0 • N o • C/ V 1^_ Political Agency, Bahrain, 23rd January 1945. \ My dear Sir Geoffrey, Please refer to my demi-official letter No.C/29 of the 6th of January and to my Printed Letter No .c/118 of the 23rd January. 2. You will see from the enclosure to my printed letter under reference that the question of the transportation of the employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company was not brought . up at the meeting of the Labour Committee. Searching enqui ries indicated that Anderson^ alarm was not well founded and that there did not appear to be any reason to suppose that 4) a strike was imminent. Anderson like PharaohA old hardened his heart and gave no indication that he contemplated an increase in pay to cover the expenditure now incurred by his employees on transportation. Yours sincerely, (ir.rf* The Hobble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K*C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, OkI 3. 5, I saw Anderson today, January 6th, anc told him that in. my opinion the principal grievance, and I consider it to be a justifiable grievance, ¥/as that the Company did not provide free transport for their personnel to and from work, and I suggested that instead of increasing v.'ages they should forego the present charge of ?s.9/8/- ^ month for 4 transportation. T also told him that I had been unable to confirm any rumours of dIs-satisfaction among his employees or any suggestion that a strike ''as imminent• He raised so many objections to my proposal and s^mo of thera were^ flimsy that I suggested that it would probably ba better for him to put forward his own solution to the problem. He then said that he proposed to discuss the question with Ohliger, General Manager of the Arabian American Oil Company, very shortly and that he would probably suggest increasing the minimum war allowairx /li Cvwd /tef which is now In other words would be an increased wage to pay for their transportation but the transportation would not be freei, A rather nice- disiinctionj still a principle is preserved and having regard co postrar conditions when it might be undesirable for the Company to compete with local transport companies it Is probably as well not to concede the concession of 'free transport' at present# I told Anderson that his suggestion certainly had the merit of benefiting the lowest paid members of his staff and that I proposed to call a meeting of the labour Committee to discuss various outstanding questions on the 11th of January and that no doubt he would have his ideas crystallised by that date. Yours sincerely, This would mean that all unskilled and semi-skilled labour drawing less than Ss.4/- a day would receive a war allowance of K.s.20/-.\o/i- G- THE, BAHREIN PJT ROLSUM C O LgAIlY L IIH T SD CJA FF FOxtiSIQ-N SERVICE AGRE3:.3NT LONG TSR1VI 3 (Emp loyee) •TlilS IjEI^ORANDUZ . sets forth tiie ter^is, conditions and privileges of Foreign Service agreed between the abovenamed Company and Employee, as follows:- TERM AND PLACE 0?

ILPOHTANT . One Canadian and two American employees of Bahrain Petroleum Company have resigned from the Company's service thus breaking their foreign service agreements forfeiting any right whatsoever to repatriation expenses thereunder. Since their resignation, they have stayed on in their quarters and eaten at the Company's mess. 2. Ward Anderson, Chief Local Representative, Bahrain Petroleum Company, informs me in such cases Company •formerly paid repatriation expenses but has now decided not to do so in attempt to discourage resignations. As these three men are trespassing Company's premises he enquired from me whether .they could be deported. I replied that I did not think now was the appropriate time for Company withdraw concession from their labour which they had previously been granting, and that I did not think you would agree deportation of such men because of their attempting to trespass. 1 gave this opinion informally but Anderson requests that I obtain your agreement and I would be grateful if you could telegraph accordingly. CQI^NT . I do not think Anderson is in agreement with Company's attempt to take 'strong line' and he wishes for your opinion so as to strengthen his own attitude vis-a-vis the Company.

The most important change from our point of view is the abolition of the one simple clause 19 in the old Foreign Service Agreement guaranteeing repatriation and the substitution for the substance of it by the clauses 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. These seem, however, to guarantee repatriation in all cases and t lis is the main point. 3.

The Political Agency, Bahrain. No. C/834. 27th August, 1945, II To The Political Agent, Bahrain, Camp, Shlraz. Memorandum . 1 ^ s ■ Reference attached copies of my telegrams Nos. 471 and 477 of 25th and 26th August respectively and also copies of two telegrams from Kr. Ward Anderson to his principals in New York which were seen in censorship. I am also enclosing a copy of the Foreign Service Agreement for ready reference. 2. About ten days ago I was told by Mr. Russell Brown, in the course of casual conversation, that the South Africans, in a body, had demanded increased rates of pay, their contention being that an American or Canadian working under them as their assistant often drew more pay than they did as the one in charge of the job. As you know there is a separate and distinct wage rate for employees of different nationalities and that distinction has and always will cause some discontent, for which there is probably little justification if the reasons are correctly appreciated. 3. The South African employees therefore decided to put in a joint demand for an increase of pay to bring their•s more nearly to the same level as that of American and Canadian employees. I think about 90^ of those who joined this 'Union' were oper^tprs. 4. The Company refused to deal with the strikers as an 'Union' and tried to insist on dealing with each case separately; the employees refused to accept that method and after several days negotiations matters came to a head and the employees quit work. % 5. On the 25th August 1945, some twenty of the strikers collected at the Agency and asked to see me which they did at 1215 hours. At 1300 hours Mr. Ward Anderson came to the Agency in a state of considerable excitement with the news that the strikers were fomenting agitation in the Refinery and that the strike would result in the closing down of a portion of the Refinery. I went through their specific complaints in detail with him and he related the Company^ point of view, which was to the effect that the South Africans 1 demands for increased rates were not justified and that their absenting themselves from work was sufficient reason for the Company's discharging them for cause under Clause X of the Agreement - their absence being premeditated. 6. I told Mr. Ward Anderson that I would call three leaders to see me at 1630 hours and see what I could do to settle the matter. I should mention here that the discharged employees had refused transportation offered them and Mr. Ward Anderson asked me, during our interview, what action the Agency proposed taking to remove them from the Island. He also said that the Company/2 Company could obviously not accede to organised demands for revised rates of pay and that rather than do so they would close down the whole Refinery. ?• At 1630 hours the three spokesmen arrived and I went through their demands one by one, I pointed out that discharge for cause did not entitle them under the Foreign Service Agree ment to pay in lieu of three months notice and asked them if they contended that they had not given cause. I understood that in certain individual cases there were reasons for holding that cause for absenting themselves was not admitted, e.g. (a) one man was issued with a letter discharging him for cause in that he absented himself on the 25th August (when he came down to the Agency with permission according to him) and that the cause was premeditated. The strikers maintained that the normal practice was to discharge for cause for absence from work only after the third day of abdence. I think their contention had some justification but the Company held that the absence was deliberate and premeditated. One of their spokesmen wished to protest against discharge for cause and drafted a letter there and then in which he stated that 'he accepted dismissal under Clause IX. ,, It took some time for me to persuade him of the futility of issuing a letter of that nature. The spokesmen eventually agreed that, if they wished to protest against discharge for cause and loss of three months pay in lieu of notice, their best course was to consult a lawyer On return to South Africa and take civil action to remedy their complaint. 8. With regard to their second demand to be allowed to draw vacation pay and their thrift fund in Bahrain, I explained that the Company informed me that it was clearly laid down in the Employee's Handbook and the Thrift Fund Rules that in the case of discharge for cause neither allowance was payable. All three spokesmen said that the vacation allowance and thrift fund had been paid in several cases they knew of and claimed similar treatment. I told them that the Company v /ere intending to give them their vacation allowance (Mr.Ward Anderson told me so that morning) but not the thrift fund. The spokesmen were not impress ed by this concession because it would, in practice, be held against the cost of transportation. They also admitted after some argument that the Company was perfectly at liberty legally to grant or refuse concessions over and above the contract. 9. Their final demand was that their transportation be paid in full and a reasonable daily allowance given for the time en route. Mr. Ward Anderson had told me that the Company were, as usual, paying the cost of tfcansportation, and hotel bills en route. This I explained to them and they demanded a daily allow ance for cigarettes, etc. I agreed to speak to the Chief Local Representative on the latter point (he later agreed to give them this allowance which he told me might be 'smart policy';. 10. This interview lasted two hours in all and, in the beginning, there seemed to be little chance of a compromise being reached. The strikers and their representatives were extremely obdurate and obstinate and in my opinion illogical and ill advised in their actions. In the end the spokesmen agreed to inform the other strikers that their best course, as they refused point blank to return to work, was to take legal opinion in South Africa and, if they wished, civil action agains the Company^ agents there. They did, however, finally agree, after a lengthy discussion on the principles of equal pay for all persons irrespective of nationality or different costs of living, etc. they did agree that there was nothing to be gained by their staging/3. staging a sit down strike in Awali and refusing to leave until their demands were acceded to. 11. I apologise for the length of this letter but thought you would be glad to have the details. I would like, however, to say two things in conclusion. Firstly, I feel the management of the Company should have been able to settle these grievances themselves and failed because, as I have often noticed before in dealing with Americans, they seem to be unable to sumnon up the patience to sit down and thrash the whole business out in conference. In passing, it is of interest to remark that the three spokesmen told me they had been called in invidually before six or seven high officials in one room who subjected them to what they called 'third degree' - which consisted of much shouting, banging of the table, and refusal to listen to their demandsi I also felt that there was some evidence that the Company's action in discharging for cause, in some cases, would not bear too close a scrutiny and might be considered a bit high handed., 4* ^- The second point I should like to mention is that I have given the impression that there may be some attempt to put fofwurd an 'Union' 1 demand on the part of British employees also; more especially when the Defence Regulation governing their employment is removed# We may therefore again be faced witli a siiuilar situation in the near future and I feel that it might be useful if there was an agreed method of arbitration ( a s far as I know there is none at the moment) and some means of enforcing removal if the employee does not accept the decision. You may not think this necessary but it might be worth considering. In this connection please see the portion I have underlined in Mr. Ward Anderson's telegram No. 561 the exact import of which is not clear to me. 12. I shall be glad if you would let me know if I acted correctly. (J- jrl Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain.4C Donald ^anna 1645 hrs. 25th August 1345. 558.

Have noted exchange of cables with Ilanna in regard to wage adjustments, different groups and think you should have informat= ion on situation here as follows. Government has already cancelled thousands of war time contracts and it is estiiiiated there will be at least three and one half million unemployed by September first which will probably Increase to five million by October firat and it is our opinion imemploymsnt here, England and Canada will increase and continue in of ect for sometime to come. Practically all 100 octane contracts with GovernTaent in this country have been cancelled and we will be very fortunate if ail new refinery Bahrain is not closed down which might necessitate returning 3 to 4 hundred men to their homer. Conditions are such that present is no time to consider raising wage levels or Hiaking any adjustments other than possibly a few isolated cases of obvious inequity. For your personal and confidential information, strong likelihood present bonus may be discontinued December 31 with no compensating adjustments of any kind. In regard to housing situation anticipate will continue to pay separation allowance where necessary if desirable nen prefer to remain in Bahrain for year or two in event now refinery not closed down otherwise will be able to replace with experienced operators who will be unemployed. Shall not wish to replace Berchtel men leaving construction work as no necessity speeding up this work now. Berchtel and other groups will have to leave entirely in our hands matter of compensation for different groups based on economic conditions and labour rates e^ch country and we have no intention using international exchange rates in determining this. Suggest you do not put this cable on bulletin, but no objection to your informing individual employees situation prevailing at this time. HerronP.a .B. Telegram S Agency. i' Political, Bahrain.

Bahrein IS W L, 'T'Lffh* -f ~ li 73 1 7a- ^ '■'? &lt; Dear Sir: Kindly refer to the attachments of your letters Nos. C/1024 and C/1025, statements made before you by the above- named men, and to which you request the Company's comments. Both of the above-named men were recruited in the United Kingdom during July, 1945, and reported for duty here as Electricians on Bahrein the following month. The reason given by the men which made it necessary for the Company to terminate their Foreign Service Agreements is substantially correct. The Company feels that its re cruiting Agent in the United Kingdom erred in recruiting these men, as they proved to be either unwilling, or unqualified to perform the duties of other craftsmen in the Electrical Depart ment. The Company enforces all known Safe Practice Re gulations of the Petroleum Industry, and the American Elec trical Code. Both Mr. Smith and Mr. Cole stated that their Workmen's Union did not permit the type of work carried on in the Company's Refinery, and therefore refused duties that other electricians, both British and American, carry out when necessity demands, using, of course, the approved safety equipment and appliances provided by the Company. Under the circumstances, the Company believed that it was more than fair to these men to terminate their Agree ments with one month's notice, provide them with transportation and salary en route to their homes, rather than discharge the men under another clause of the Agreements for failure to carry out their assigned duties. The Company does not believe there was any misrepresentation of the Job offered the men, as the subject of working on live lines was probably neither raised2—H.B.M. f s Political Agent, Bahrein Island: October 31, 194-5. by the men, nor the recruiting Agent, and it is the first time this question has been raised by any of our electrical force, as it is standard practice as far as we can determine in both Britain and America to carry out work in this manner. For your information, the Company has cabled its London Representative outlining this case and has instructed the Recruiting Agent to specifically raise this question with any further recruits in order to avoid any future cases of this nature. In regards to the text of the letter given these men in terminating the Agreements on which they were employed, Paragraph IX of the Foreign Service Agreement is as follows '(a) Either Company or Employee may terminate Em ployee' s service hereunder at any time by giving one to the other previous written notice of intention so to do. The minimum period of said notice shall be one month un less, upon termination. Employee shall have completed one year or more of continuous service in the employ of the Company includ ing service antedating this Agreement, in the event of which the minimum period of notice shall be three months. ^(b) Alternatively at its discretion Company may terminate Employee f s service hereunder at any time without previous notice upon pay ment to Employee of a sum of money equi valent to salary for the required period of notice, dependent upon the length of Em ployee's service, specified in (a) 11 • In view of the above, the Company believes it un necessary to specifically state the reason for the termination. However, if it were necessary to state a reason for the ter mination of these two men, the Company could only state that the men were either unqualified, or unwilling to perform the duties of an oil refinery maintenance electrician in the Com pany^ Bahrein Refinery. Regarding their advice that they did n«t receive actual written notice until some days after the verbal notice given them, this has no point, as they will receive salary to end of the notice period, or to the actual date of their arrival home, whichever is later.3—H.B.M, *3 Political Agent, Bahrein Island: October 31, 1945, The Company will be pleased to answer any further questions you may have on this matter, or discuss the case if you deem necessary.

In view of the foregoing the Company considers it unnecessary to state specifically the reason for terminating your agreement and I agree. If, however, you wish that a specific reason should be given I will again apj roa^h them. o. On tho whole, I am of the opinion that while the Company have been compelled to discharge you from their service, your discharge is due to a misunderstanding and should not prejudice the question of your future employment in the United Kingdom or any other country.

January 10, 1946. GEORGE SCOTT Dear Sir: With reference to our conversation of the 9th inst regarding the above-named, i am enclosing herewith a report compiled by Mr. C.R. Barkhurst, Refinery Superintendent, on the work of Mr.Scott since his arrival on the Island on 13th December, 194-5 ? which I think is self-explanatory. i should like to emphasize that Mr.Scott was not engaged to work at Bahrein as a Chemist. Prior to his de parture from the United Kingdom, he was advised that he was being recruited for work as a Junior Laboratory Operator, and he agreed to sign his Letter of Agreement on this basis upon his arrival at Bahrein. However, in spite of several requests to report to the office to sign this Agreement, he has so far failed to do so. Yours very truly, W.P. Anderson, Chief Local Representative, The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited. Attachment. Coufidsntial. BAHRAIN RECEIPT. i^U; Dat0 .A^./A.'.Mw&amp;COPY;MK January 9, 1946. MR, W.P&gt; ANDERSON. GEORGE SCOTT . In response to Mr. Ayto^ request for a report on the work this boy is doing, I have the following comnients. He reported to the Refinery on December 15th, and according to the information we received, he filled Re quisition No.191, covering request for a Junior Laboratory Operator. He was accordingly assigned to the Laboratory, and since we had vacancies in the Cargo Inspection and Ethylizing Group, he was placed with this Group for break- in and training. As you know, this work calls for a cer tain amount of technical and operating knowledge and skill, but does not require the high degree of technical training of an analytical Chemist. We do regard the job as a very important one, however, since mistakes on the part of a Cargo Inspector can be very costly, inasmuch as he is re sponsible for seeing that the products are loaded without contamination, and that proper check is maintained on quality and quantity during the loading. I have not received Scott f s papers, so cannot give in detail what his previous experience has been, but Mr. Watson has ascertained that he has studied chemistry at school, but has not completed enough work to receive a de gree, in other words, he is not a graduate chemist. He is a young man, about twenty, and apparently is having some difficulty in adjusting himself to the job, judging by re ports from his Foreman, who states that he has a rather know-it-all attitude at present. Watson talked to him yesterday and e3Q)lained that he should adopt an attitude of willingness to work and learn and that the Cargo Inspection job is an important one which requires exercise of consider able judgment and common sense, also that it isn't something which can be learned in a week. It may be that Scott is not adapted to the job he is doing, and if he isn f t, we will, of course, try him out on something else. He has requested a transfer to the Analytical Laboratory, but I see no possibility of doing this since, for one thing, he does not have sufficient back ground to fit him for the job, and in the second place, we already have three men who have qualifications and experience for the Analyst's job and do it very well, hence we have adequate coverage in this Department.- 2 - In my opinion, Scott is in a good position to learn a great deal about handling oil if he applies himself, but he cannot expect to advance to the top jobs without going through a training period the same as the rest of our men have had to do. In this connection, I would point out that with a few exceptions, all of the chemists we have had in the Laboratory have had varying lengths of time on the Cargo Inspection and Ethylizing jobs. Certainly all of the top Laboratory men have had this training. (Signed) C.R. BARKHURST.'h No.C/81. Political Agency, Bahrain, Dated the 16th January, 1946.

The 3rr) Septei-ber, 1947, 57 V Dear Colonel Galloway, Russell Brown has lioday informed me that, as a result of the Arabian Atierican Oil Company's making large increases in the v /ages paid to their Arab labour in S^udi Arabia - dictated to them by Ibn Spud's insist ing that they should pay their Arab labour at the same rates as their Italian and Indian labour the Bahrain Pecroleum Company, in consultation with the Adviser to the Bahrain ioverni; enti. intend to announce immediately an increase of Re.i/- a day to all their Arab staff. They expect also to have to make further increases to their semi-skilled labour if they are to prevent their migrating to Dhahran. 2. To prevent pearl divers bound to their nakhudas by debt fror leaving Bahrain during the pearling season, exit from Bahrain was, until recently, restricted. The restriction was lifted three days ago - as soon as the pearling fleet had put out after the Id - except for employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the Bahrain Government, and masons and carpenters required for building projects. 3. About 600 labourers are reported to have left Bahrain for Ras T^nura v/ithin the last two days; but Russell Brov/n thinks that the more comfortable living conditions pertaining in Bahrain, together with the increase in wages shortly to be announced, will suffice to keep labour employed by the Bahrain Petroleuj .i Company on the island voluntarily. v 4. Russell Brov .n mentioned that the Arabian American Oil Company wish to employ 10,000 more Arab labourers than they employ at present as soon as their projects at Dammam and 'isha'ab and in connection with the Railway to Riyadh get under way early next year. 5. The basic daily rate paid to Arab labourers by the Bahrain petroleum Company before the present increase of Re.l/- '.VciS Rs.1/12/-, and some increase appears - -in view of the wages nov being paid in Kuwait and Abadan - to have been overdue.

Reference to previous correspondenceTranslation of a leaflet 1 sued and distributed by an orgaMsation which describes itself by the name of 'Hone Front'. 0^ Respectable compatriots, every nation in every part of the world has risen to defend Its extorted rights and to strup^le for Its outraged dignity, expending therefor everything cheap and dear; whilst we in Bahrain are still overcome with slumber and overwhelmed with idleness; our hearts are struck with timidity and consternation. .Ye must rise to keep pace with the world and to eliminate the biggest incubus lying in our midst, which threatens the utilities of our life and injures our dignity with its unbearable injustice and dictatorialship. You may not know yet, 0, respectable compatriot, that there is in your country who expends his utmost to realise your long-cherished hopes and to restore your extorted rights. This organisation has written to the Colonial Office demanding all that guarantees the rights of the country and its respectable nation. The first of these demands is the displacement of the present Adviser (Belgrave); the second the formation of a legislative council to enact law for the country, 1 such law as would be known by all, so that the fate of the ,individual may not be tampered with by persons as dictated by 'their self-interested feeling and as guided by their disposition ^to partiality; and the third is the formation of a Labour Guild to protect and safeguard their (labour) interests. This is to be elected ^y general voting, so ^hat It may be an example of probity and sincerity. There are other demands, though t * secondary in importance, are domed essentia*'! by circumstances A and which the organisation aims at realising them. Two copies of this leVter have been sent to each of the Political Resident and the Political Arent. /e are required to observe silence towards matters that directly concern our living; how is it possible for ns to do so? Take an example. ./e have learnt rei^rjble sources ^hat the office of the Bahrain Petroleum Company in America has written to the office of the Company in Bahrain authorising an increase o: Re.l/- per day per hea'i.2 /o7 The? latter In turn has, to obviate being accused of competition, written to the local authorities for approval; but the local authorities disapproved this increment. Triey may have later authorised an increase of Annas 4/- only; In this (attitude) there is so much injustice that cannot be tolerated. ! further, what lo you say about the ban imposed on travellers to the neighbouring countries, '''here higher wages can be obtained. Is there anything of justice in this? IVe wholeheartedly hope that our honourable shaikhs would not construe this movement as being directed against them or pertalnable in any way whatever to any of their affairs. No; certainly no; it is rath«r in their benefit, in the benefit of their subjects and r or the safeguard of the rights of any one residing in this country. .Ve, also, shout at Our native policemen not to be unier misapprehension; they suffer from hardship of life, insufficiency of pay and paucity of jSHHiDfix promotion that no one else suffers. Let them support this movement so that they themselves may be the holders of the rein 01 the utilities oj * their country, so that they may not be domineered over by who have been dejected by pover^/ and privation and 'ho fired by ambition for authority and power, i.ley should not be helr^lo the foreigners arairut their 'countrymen, who do not want but welfare, glory and honour /or them. You, beuevulent merchants, - we are certain that the oppression you undergo and the difficulty you experience are such as would not befit your position and such as you would not be pleased with. You are the speaking tongue of the country, its shining appearance and the source of its abundant wealth. You are from the nation and for it you must prepare yourselves; it is imperative on you to lead it. You must nnite; let not your way ramify or yourselves retreat to rest. •e are acting, 0, countrymen. From God we ask for success and from you help and support. God is a help to the faithful as long as the faithfi 1 Is an aid to his fellow-brother.CQNFIDENriAL . D.O. No .c/958. POLITICAL AGENCf BAHRAIN. The 11th September, 1947. $ r\ Dear Colonel Galloway, X Please refer to the correspondence resting with my demi-official letter No. c/940, dated the 3rd of Sepcernber, 1947. I enclose a copy in translation of a leaflet issued shortly after it became known that the Arabian American Oil Company had made large increases in the wages paid to their Arab labour. The questions of the replacement of BOlgrave; the formation of a Legislative Council and a Labour Guild; and the codi fication of the laws of Bahrain have been recently dealt with in ray predecessor's demi-official letter No,c/895 dated the 14th August, 1947. 2. As already reported, the Bahrain petroleum company have agreed to an increase of Re.l/- per day in their basic wage for Arab labourers. There remains the question of restrictions on the emigration of labour in search of higher wages mencioned in paragraph 2 of ray demi-official letter under reference. The departure of pearl divers from Bahrain was, until recently, restricted. These restrictions have already formed the subject of corres pondence with the Residency in Ranee's demi-official letter No.C/1091, dated the 1st October, 1946. What is not clear from that letter, but is obvious from the correspondence in this oTfice, is that the restrictions on migration of pearl divers were imposed as a result of a petition submitted Co His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain by Bahrain pearling naKhudas, and that the Shaikh used his differences with Qatar as an excuse for restricting their movements to gatar while, at the same time, prevent ing the migration elsewhere both fpearl divers and other labourers and artizans. t 3. As already reported, the restrictions on the migration of divers have been lifted; but those on employees of the Bahrain petroleum Company and artizans required by the Bahrain Government remain. The Bahrain petroleUiQ Company are willing to pay wages surficiently attractive to retain their labour voluntarily; and there appears to be no reason why the Bahrain Government should not do the same, and rely on good administration of the island, rather than on restrictive practices, to retain their artizans. 4. It is possible that the arbitrary action of Ibn Saud in fixing the wages of Arab labour in Saudi Arabia /in parity The Hon'ble Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.-2- in parity with those paid to Italian and Indian labour, combined with the heavy demand for labour that is likely to develop in Saudi Arabia in the near future, might prejudice the efficient working of the Bahrain petroleum Company and other undertakings essential to the Bahrain State if these restrictions were entirely removed at this juncture; but I consider that their removal is a desirable reform to be aimed at as soon as circumstances permit. Meanwhile, every effort should be made so to improve the administration of Bahrain that the advantages of living here, combined with adequate wages, may suffice to keep the requisite labour force here voluntarily. Yours sincerely.COHFIDEK TIAL. POLiriCAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 13th of September, 1947 D.O. No.C/959 Dear Colonel Galloway Please refer to the correspondence resting with my demi-official letter No.c/958, dated the 11th' September, 1947. I understand that further anonymous letters have been received by His Highness containing complaints against the Adviser and the Acting Adviser. I mentioned this to His Highness this morning when he was ready to leave after paying me a visit for no oscensible purpose other than to return a call I paid him last Aoek. r lG dilated cwn the subject for over an hour5 and, in the course of his talk, he mentioned - with his eyes averted from mine - that it had been suggested that the movement had been instigated from the Agency. He continued, however, that the real purpose of these letters was not so much to secure better conditions for labour in Bahrain as to cause estrangement between himself and the Agency, and to foster anti-British feeling. 4. I replied that my object in mentioning this - and our policy in all such matters - was to ascertain what was most In the interests of himself and his State and to assist him to attain it. T continued that the surest way to prevent the letter writers from attaining their objective was for both of us to keep each other fully informed of what was going on, and to work so frankly and so closely together that no one could separate us. This was not possible, I added, if I were not informed of the nature of the complaints against His Highness*s Advisers. His Highness replied that the letters were not signed and that he had hitherto been unable to find out who wrote them; but that, as soon as he knew who had done so, he would, if the offender were a foreigner, ask for my assistance in dealing with a person acting against our joint interests. He continued that it was always his practice to do this, but - reverting to his grievances in respect of gatar - he regretted that he had not always found his political Agents willing to take action against those who plotted against him. He repeatedly avoided, by reversion to his grievances in ^atar, committing himself to sending me copies of the letters. •p* The Acting Adviser, to whom I have since spoken, informs me that T lis Highness has the letters in his personal possession. The Acting Adviser has, however, promised to try to send me copies tomorrow. Yours sincerely The Hon'ble Lt-col. A.C. Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bahrain.

Becent increases in the wage rate of Arab labour in Saudi Arabia have had an unsettling effect on labour in Bahrain* The local labour of the Bahrain Petroleum Company have threatened to strike and leaflets have been circulated denouncing the Bahrain Government t and in particular the Adviser, Mr. Belgrave, for the keeping down of wages and the orders mentioned in paragraph 1 above restricting the free and economic movement of labour, 3* The Bahrain Petroleum Company have met the situation by agreeing to increase the basic wage for Arab labour from Rs.1/12/- to Rs.2/12/- per day. The management is however concerned at the situation and have reported the matter to their New York Office. 4, The growing projects of the American Arabian Oil Company and of Petroleum Development (Qatar), Limited, and the construction of the Riadh Railway will greatly increase in the near future the demand for Arab labour on the mainland* The Bahrain Petroleum Company are reported to be prepared to* pay sufficiently attractive wages to retain their labour voluntarily. In order to prevent more serious labour unrest and dissatisfaction with the administration it will be necessary for the Bahrain Govern ment to adopt a sufficiently attractive standard of wages.

CONFIDENTIAL - ^ ane' My dear Galloway, We had a visit on Sept 26th from Ballantyne and Hanna oj the Bahrein Petroleum Company who wished to know whether we had any information on possible labour troubles developing with their Company at Bahrein. They said that they had gathered from Russel-Brown at Bahrein that there was some possibility of their Bahraini employees coming out on strike as a demonstration against the ineffectiveness of Belgrave's administration. We mmfpr, informed them that we had no information on this subject apart from the petition forwarded with your letter No. 1604 S dated the 5th September. -.91 — A . 1 Ballantyne was shown this petition and said immediately that he suspected that it had been written by Hussain Yatim of Manama. He mentioned that he had been forced to speak rather sharply to Hussain .Yatim when he last saw him, for being too outspoken on the subject of the affairs of the Bahrein Government in general and of Belgrave's failings in particular. In his view Hussain Yatim was a likeable personality though cunning and very ambitious. Ballantyne suggested that there might be some advantage in a hint to him from the Company that they disapproved of their agents meddling with such matters and that it would be in the interest of Hussain Yatim to assist in stopping any agitation against Belgrave. Hanna informed us that he was shortly leaving for Bahrein where he expected to remain for about a month, and we therefore suggest thst the best ^ course would be for him to discuss the matter with you or Hay on the spot. We should be glad if you would keep us informed of any developments• * liiis\a &gt; ' / ^ The 9th of December, 1947, Dear Mr. Brown, Our menial servants in che Agency and Kesiuency have applied for Increases In' pay aiid Lhe ra^es paid by your Company to the similar cla:-3 o,r people are relevant.

Underwood said that whereas the Americans work hard and were worth double their pay, the British with a few exceptions do no more work than the minimum required of them and go off every day punctually at 4 p.m. to their beer and gin. Many of them were originally in the Eighth, Army and consider this fact entitles them to leisure for the rest of their lives. Littler says that many of them have been complaining to him and asking him what they can do to obtain release from their contracts.

I (^ American Oil Kings Treat Indians As Chattels r* By haghu Up above the Persian Gulf, washed by its waters and far beyond the gaze of the civilised world lies the Bahrain Island, the land of liquid gold. It is a part of the vast industrial empire of America, where the de facto ruler is the wer- Bahrain Petroleum Company, known as 'BAPCO* in the parlance of the oil Kings of the world. In 'BAPCO 1 there are no smuts and Malans, yet it is a South Africa in its own small way to the thousand and•odd Indian emigrants who are recruited in the Company's service by their agents in Bombay. This desert Island of Bahrein is a mysterious one; none knows what is going on behind that watery curtain of the Persian Gulf. There are no newspapermen over there; none is permitted. No newspaper ever crosses the border, ngne is allowed. The only way to get at this liquid business on the island is to wait patiently at Bombay's Ballard Pier, where one will come across every other month a batch of Indian deportees rushing to the Port Trust Office to settle their claims with the 'Protector of Emigrants'. ons such batch landed in bombay on june 26 by s s barjoha. they webe eight indian shift chemists, one sindhi, two bengalis and five malayees. they went to behhein to e A kn a livelihood under a thre . year contract, but before the term was over they were driven out of the island. there is a sordid story, a story of racial hatred, unlimited humiliation and and wilfull discrimination, These eight Indian chemists represent among themselves the partial but unsuccessful resistance ^ut up by the Indian community, numbering more than 2,00 against the horrid colour war that has been raging in the Island, '^hey were not fortune seekers, almost all of them were driven overseas in economic desperation, but according to them no Indian in 'Bapco' can ec.rn an honest living without putting his self respect and national pride in cold storager As in South Africa, here also, colour and racial ^ discrimination form the key note of the Comanpy's treatment of Indians. Bahrein is in a way even worse than South Africa where • the Indian can at least stay on &amp; fight but in Bahrain they are booked by the first available ship. The Americans claimed Bahrain Petroleum Companv is the second largest oil company in the Persian Gulf Region', ^'his company employs more than 1,000 Indians of who tworthirds are day labourers! classified as artisans and the rest are clerks and technical personnel, termed as Clerical and technical employees. According to the system of payment the artisans are grouped into two categorie : 'Contract Daily* and Contract Monthly employees. The bachelor artisans are provided with free quarters situated in a barren wastelend away from the oil refinery. To get married is to lost free quarters, though the married artisan is a paltry allowance, The conditions of the 'Contract Monthly' or 'c.m', to use the ivlanagement's favourite abbreviations, are still worse. ^his class of employees includes clerks, chemists, surveyors, etc. These employees are not given free quarters, but only an allowance and are left to the tender mercies of the landlords. They are all housed in Manama, a congested and insanitary township fifteen niles away from the place of work. The overwhelming Z of the- 2 - of the married C.Ms are condemned to enforced bachelorhood by regulations which place an embargo on their families. MANAMA HAS NO PIPE V .ATUB, xuVukil GALLON I IAS TO PAID FOR. SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SIDE OF LIFE IS IMPOSSIBLE hS THE COMPANY DOES NOT PiiOVIDE ANY FACILITY FOii LIBKIES OU RECREATION CENTRES. TMi'. JTHii^ But Bahrein is not all desert, a waterless, rainless, god-forsaken place. It is so only to the Indians and the native Arabs. The 'Bapco' has carved out a heaven on the desert Island for the American and British Personnel. T hey are provided with free furnished airconditioned quarters at the work spot. T hey have everything free, food, laundry, entertainments, etc.. While Indian families are forbidden memsahibs are induced to come over to Bahrain by granting special family allowance to 'white' personnel. Strict care is exercised to see that no Indian caste his evil shadow over this cosy and compact residential town of the master race. If, by any chance a vehicle carrying Indians passes through these quarters the passengers are subjected to a thorough search. Segregation exists in transport services too. Indians are not allov/ed to travel on vehicles carrying American or British personnel whereas the Americans or British can stop any Indian vehicle and ride on it. On entering and leaving the refinery Indian vehicles are searched as if the occupants are so many dangerous thugs. It goes so far that even food in tiffin carriers are tampered with. The Indians might have qualifications efficiency and seniority, but all that is of no aval to them. Colour is the supreme qualification in ^apco* service. The depth of humiliatinn can be imagined when it is Known that even the lunch and dinner ticket of an Indian employee has to be countersigned by a white man even though the former has a personal account with the company. Or all the C.M's. chemists are most unfortunate, One of the most irritating indigAities they have to suffer is that they are forced to work under raw v/hite employees even though the latte may be quite ignorant of the fundamental principles of Chemistry. The unpardonable crime the eight chemists, who have been referred to was not that they gave expression to this atrocity, but that thy the y were found harbouring ©Hftengepiftg that grievance, which in the judgement of the Management was bound to burst one day endangering the loyalty of other employees. So they were sacked. The Bapco believes in prevention being better than cure. TABOO ON THh.DE UNIONS Trade Union is a taboo in Bahrein. Yet efforts were MtR made to make individual and collevtive representations to the Management praying for an improvement in the lot of the Indians. But v/ithout any exception all these were unceremoniausly turned down, The company ruthlessly suppresses all representations and very often those who take a leading part in making them are packed off to India under any convenient clause in the Foreign Service Agreement, which is a cumbersome document of more than 20 clauses that every employee is obliged to sign. The document is indeed a masterpiece in the American theorv of Free Contract. Here is a typical clause: ' The Company may at any time, with or without notice, terminate this agreement ^ fo r cause, and any of the follownliM for cause, and any Qf the following.shall be deemed a cause^- insubordination, intemperence, use of narcotics, venereal disease, self -injury willfully inflicted, non-compliance with company s re 'Dilations or instructions, dishonesty and misconduct . This s the big stick which the company resort^ to whenever it wants to remove anybody it does not like.

On February 30 and after a lot of printers ink has flowed in America following the assination of Iflahatma Ghandi, exto-ling his virtues which they ridiculed while he lived. But the American Gpneral I^ana^er of Bapco, a Mr. R.M. Brown, is no hypocrite. He promptly cut the Indian employees pay for the day they abstained from work to mourn the death of GandhiJi. A few decades have passed since the Americans v/ent to Bahrein to carry on their free enterprise. In the courses of iheir graciously shut down thoir business can be guessed fron the one fact that they have not established ax* single school for the Arabs in their concession area. INTERVEN TTuN i ^CESS a RY And yet the Americans are careful not to overstep the boundary as far as the sentiments of the Arabs are concerned, ^ut an Indian-remains a slave of the Company, segregated, disc_imin- ated and snubbed on account of his colour. The Bapco knows this and their latest manouvres is to keep out Hindus and recruit Muslim from Pakistan. But they are not quire successful as Pakistan has no skilled labour to apare. Only the intervention of the Government of India will save the Indians from the indignities heaped upon them by the clauses in the Eoreign Service Agreemeiiitshou-d be modifi ?a ^ to remove the -ross discrimination, before the company s agents are allowed to recluit in India. The dovernment of India also should appoint an accredited representative of theirs to look after the interests of the Indian natinnalsin the British Protectorate o^ the Persian Gulf.

Dear Sir, I am in receipt of your letter #C/L-228 dated 2nd July, 19^9• In May 19^9 the Company terminated the agreements of two employees, one Indian and one Portuguese subject, under Clause 10 of their agreements• These men were surplus to our requirements. Clause 10 of the agreement is applicable and is normally used in such cases. Although not obliged to state a reason, the Company gave 'retrenchment' as the reason for termination. Both employees had specially requested that this reason be shown in their Certificate or Service, on the grounds that it would not reflect against them in obtaining employment elsewhere. Clause 10 of the Indian agreement reads as follows ' '10. The COMPANY has the right to terminate this agreement at any time by giving the EMPLOYEE one month's notice in writing or one month's salary in lieu of notice.' This is the most advantageous termination clause for the employee and both men were given full settlement in accordance with the terms of the agreement, i.e. one month's salary in lieu of notice, transportation with food, and salary for travel time to place of recruitment. As Clause 10 is habitually used and as there has been no deviation from its conditions or those of Clause 13&gt; the Company is umble to understand on what basis the complaint has been made. I trust the above information will suffice for your purpose and shall be grateful if you will keep me advised or any further development in this matter. v (WJidenHa!. BAITS. .UN RECEIPT.

Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. L'Trensletion of an enonynous letter addressed to Kls Fxcellency the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain deted 25th HaMPl Awal, 136? (14th Janurry IfSO). :Ve the youth of Bahrain have heard that the agreement 'between the Government of Bahrain and the American Oil Com pany has expired at long last. During this time, we the la^urers of Bahrain hove hrd to contend with a gre^t deal of harsh treatment and accept small salaries from these Am?r T c©ns. It is possible, if you so desire, since you are the Pepresentatives of Britain and look after the adminis- trrtion of t 1s country to produce Improvements and clauses which will benefit the Bahrain! labourer for his prosperity and obtain for him his just rights from the Company and its hars men to whor. we the Bahrain! labourers have become (an easy prey), we request you to produce these amendments and vital clauses in the new agreement, 1* Salaries The salaries received by all Bahrain em ployees are v^ry small end nothing in comparison to the services they render to the Company which does not value t^eir efforts but recruitjforeigners, like Indians and Pak istanis and pay them huge salPries. The 'blrc gold' is produced fron our country. Ife it just thPt conditions sho Id remain as they are? •*e hold you responsible for t is cheat ing of the Company and depend on your good conscience, 2. If the employee is injured or loses the use of one of his senses or dies, no one pays enough compensation. Do you consider this justice that Rs.800/- is paid for p deceased who has served t e Company for several years and for someone who loses his eyes r.s.400/. 3. Why are the Company guards given authority to jal1 and beat the Bahrain! labourer-, while t e Bahrain Government has Policemen and can punish and bring to Court anyone who has done wrong or broken the law. They often beat the Bahrain! labourers without any reasons, flfe appreciate that the Bahrain Government is responsible for all these things and that she should be the one to defend the rights of the Bahrain! labourer, but alas, we have lost all hope of our Government hearing our cry. A'e have preat hope that you the Representatives of Britain, who hold the reins of adminis- ^ tration will save us and save our rights and protect us as / beyond the Company's guards have stepped/(a31)limits. 4. The formation of a committee for the representation of lab urers. There is nothing easier than forming a Labour Represen tation Committee which should have an educated representative who has a vast knowledge of labour welfare and problems. There is no objection to his coming from the Rulinr Family, provided he has experience and knowledge of matters and that he can defend the rights of the Bahrain labourers against the Company and protect the even in the Courts and not he like the present Representative (Shaikh Ali bin Abided) from whom the Company has benefited and who has benefited from the Company more than the Bahrain! labourer has gained for his services. In fact he(the Representative) has no jurisdiction, only t^e Bahrain Government has aprointed him to 'pull wool over' the eves of the public and the labourers equally, ^ould you kindly investigate the matter which is of rreat importance and release the Bahrain! labourers from oppression and ill V 0,77, ■■ j }(2) Continued. treatment which they receive from the hands of these American^ employees of t^e Company. Your Fxcellency:- The wise British Polio;/' does not permit in any case, that we be oppressed in our country and that cur country's wealth be paid into the hands of foreigners and that we be treated badly by the Americans to t v is degree. Have you ever s^en or heard of a Company that demands froT. Its employees the hire for transportation from the place of their work to t; eir houses? Is there any Ccmpany like this in the world? Not at all, only the indifference of the Bahrain Government makes it (the Company) behave in this manner. /te, in the name rf th^ Bahrain! labourers, request your Excellency, Pepresentative of Britain in Bahrain, to consider sympathetically t ese points and beg you to include them in the new agreement which you Intend to sign with V e Company within a few days.Confidential. Political Agency, r. , Bahrain, ^O'C/L-80. 18th Februsry, 1960. p. i' 1 *' ■ Desr Mr. Brown, ~ I enclose a copy of a translation of an anonymous letter addressed to Sir Rupert Hay. I should be glad to hear any comments you may care to make. I see that our work on the com- pensatlon committee comes In for criticism amongst the other complaints. Yours sincerely, Mr, R.M. Brown, Chief Local Representative, Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd., Awall.Political Agency, Bahrain, 6th March, 1960. Dear Dredge, In order to save unnecessary copying, I forward herewith in original Russell Brown's comments on the ano nymous letter received with your letter No.92/6/60G of 11th February. On the whole I think Russell Brown replies satisfactorily to the complaints. 2. What I think might do good here is an enquiry by someone accustomed to doing the sort of welfare work which F .L. Brayne did in Northern India. I mention this idea with the greatest diffidence because a wrong sort of person could do a great deal of damage without doing the labouring class here the slightest good. The person required to my mind would have to know Arabic well, be used to welfare ) work, and above all would have to be free from any bees in his bonnet such as Thesiger has about the bedouin. He would have to understand that movement towards better ing the condition of the labouring classes, might meet the strongest opposition from their own rulers and to be beware of the political effects which might follow such a movement. On the other hand the right man might give us valuable information as to how the really poor do live and some ideas as to how to better their conditions. I doubt whether the Ministry of Labour or any other body which I know of supplies thfe sort of person whom I have in mind. Yours sincerely, Confidential. No.C/R-121. A.L.A.
