British Embassy, /o. _210 Bagdad. TW2/43). 5“ JflL 1343 13th June, 1943. Sir, / t ^ You will recall that in the summer of 1941, your approval, I organised in this country a staff of Political Advisers with assistants to combat anti-Britis activities of all kinds, to keep me informed of political and social developments throughout the country and to secure co-operation between the local Iraqi authorities and the British military forces. 2. In July 1941 I addressed to each of the officers who had then been appointed to this organization a paper defining their position and explaining to them the lines on which I wished them to direct their activities. 3. Recently there has come a need to revise this directive and I have accordingly sent a new letter to all officers of the Political Advisory Staff in which I have explained the work to which, in present circumstances and in the light of the changes that have occurred in the last two years, they should now give their attention. 4. It may be of use to have these papers in your archives and I accordingly transmit copies herewith. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosures to the Minister of State in Cairo. I have, etc., (Signed) Kinahan Cornwallis. / The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc.3 (787/1/43). British Embassy, Bagdad. ■ 8th June, 1943. Dear Aston, Dear Lyon, It has been suggested to me that conditions in Iraq have so altered since the Political Advisory Staff was first organised that it is desirable that their duties should be reconsidered in the light of this change. This is I think a good suggestion and acting on it I am now setting out in this letter my views on the character of the work which now lies before you and your subordinate officers. 2. The military duties of the Political Advisory Staff will remain much the same in principle so long as British ground forces are maintained in Iraq, though their importance will naturally decrease if the war continues to go in our favour. The other duties of the Political Advisory Staff will however always tend to vary with the political, social and economic developments which take place in the country. In my original memorandum on the duties of the Political Advisers and their assistants I emphasised that their first and most important task would be to fight ITazi influence in all its forms. The entry of America into the war on our side and our recent victories in Africa together with your own work and that of the ublic Relations and other co-operating departments, have now so far defeated Nazi propaganda in Iraq that it no longer constitutes a danger worthy to be the first object of your attention. Nevertheless we must remember that there are numbers of people who would, the moment they thought they had us at a disadvantage, give vent to the bitterness and envy that have been rankling within them for years. V/e must therefore remain on the alert against all forms of anti-British activity, though for the present what remains of purely Axis influence can I think be left in the main to be dealt with by the propaganda departments. In these circumstances the Political Advisory Staff can with advantage give more of their time to other matters. 3. At present the economic problems of the country are the first concern of both His Majesty’s Government and the Iraqi Government and it is to these problems that the Political Advisory Staff can now and for some time to come, turn their attention with special advantage. You all know generally what are the principal economic difficulties which have to be tackled and you are already being closely associated with the efforts which are being made to solve some of them, particularly with the present plans for controlling the main crops, wheat, barley and millet. Plans for rice and dates may follow and in that event will also need the help of those concerned in execution. So soon as this year’s harvest has been handled new plans, improved through experience, will have to be worked cut for next year and in this your effective co-operation will be required. There are also local, as distinct from national, economic oroblems, many of which have been created by the changes in the ordinary life of the neople brought about by war conditions and by the special demands on man power made by the British forces. These will all call for your attention and I want you to study them and help your Mutasarrifs to handle them wisely and confidently. Lieut.Col.0.0. Aston, O.B.E. Lieut.Col. &lt;7. A. Lyon C.B.E.4. It is possible now too, to iiegin to think of the future and though we cannot foresee what changes in international relations and in British foreign and imnerial policy may he brought about by the defeat of the Axis, we may safely proceed on the assumption that the political, strategical and economic importance of our position in the Middle East will increase rather than diminish. There are accordingly certain elements in our relations with Iraq which we should without doubt develop and strengthen. We must above all, continue to cultivate friendly feelings towards Great Britain and the British people among all classes of Iraqis and to be at its best this feeling should cover all points of view and every aspect of the life of the country. We want the Iraqis to feel not only that a political alliance between Iraq and Great Britain is advantageous bub also that British help and co-operation will be of solid value in every kind of legitimate national, and indeed individual, endeavour. In short we want to convince the greatest possible number of Iraqis, and especially the youth of the country, that they can best get what they want through our help and at the same time we have the task of persuading them to want what is best for them. 5. You will not need me to tell you that this is a very big task and one that will need the energies of all our different organisations. 6. We must bear in mind, however, that if we have influence we cannot escape a measure of responsibility for the general state of the country. We must therefore do all that we can (without infringing on the sovereignty and independence of the Iraqi State, the preservation of which is the basis of our policy) to help those responsible for the work of administration to do it better and to the increasing satisfaction of the people. Your own position brings you into especially close contact with the officials and your experience and the opportunities which you have for touring and meeting the tribes and village people, give you an exceotional knowledge of administrative problems. It is therefore the particular duty of the Political Advisory Staff to do all that they can within the above limits to improve the administration. There are, of course, many ways in which this can be done but it would be inexpedient to attempt to lay down hard and fast rules. The guiding principle should be to foster trust and confidence between the officia*ls and the people and to encourage, wherever it can be seen, however dimly, the ^pirit of public service. The best solvent for so many of Iraq s problems would be to put the idea of co-operation in the place of the age-old antipathy which still survives between the Government and the people, and to this end to try and make the latter grasp that they are ultimately responsible for the former. In this connection you should never allow to pass uncontested suggestions that His Majesty’s Government should take charge of administration themselves. Apart from the fact that it is not practical politics to contemplate such an about turn in our policy, it is necessary to educate Iraqis to the realisation that having sought and secured independence, they must live up to their responsibilities. It is unnecessary for me to dilate more fully on this aspect of your duties since I am well aware that you are already acting in accordance with the principles laid down in this paragraph. I am, indeed, inclined to reckon as the greatest achievement of the Political Advisory Staff the remarkable manner in which by gaining the confidence of officials they have been able to influence the local administration. 7. I should add something about Arab nationalism and the attitude which you should adopt towards it. The Arabs of Iraq as a . . ' . whole/4 whole are interested in varying degrees in three main questions outside their regional problems. These are:- ll) Palestine and Zionism, ( 2 ^ Syria and the French, (3) Arab Union. _ ^ The best line to take about these questions when they come uo tor discussion is as follows:- (1) The White Paper of May 1939 is the declared policy of His Majesty 1 s Government. It is a air settlement which gives the Arabs a real chance to build up a prosperous Palestine in which Arab culture and the Arab way of life can continue to flourish and the Arab people share in the progress and development which the Jews will hasten. ( 2 ) This is a question that must be left for settlement until after the war. Meanwhile His Majesty’s Government have given pledges for Syria’s indeoendence and the people of Syria (and of Iraq; may be sure that His Majesty’s Government will stand by these undertakings. ( 3 ) You are already acquainted with the declared attitude^ of his Majesty’s Government towards this question. It is that tney will give their full support to any scheme to strengthen the cultural, economic and political ties between the Arab countries which commands general approval but the initiative in formulating any such scheme must come from the Arabs themselves. In discussing Arab union or federation you may well emohasise the obstacles which lie in the way of the realisation of this the dynastic rivalries, the sectarian antagonisms, the^ regional economic interests and the political inexperience of the oeople themselves. Y'ou may oointoout that these obstacles have all to be overcome before union can be a success and you may show that the progress made in Iraq could easily be destroyed by a orema. ure attempt to federate the country with its neighbours. 8 . This letter, though already long, has not I know touched on many of the problems with which you have to deal irom day to day nor is it indeed feasible to be comprehensive where the diver sity of tasks is so great. I therefore leave it to you to write to me on any particular aspect of your work regarding which you feel in need of guidance. You may be sure that whenever you do so I shall do my best to help. It is in the nature of your work that you have, on the whole, to act for yourselves^ m the way ijudge best and it is on your own wisdom and discretion that I cnieily rely rather than on any guidance that I can give. The clitica Advisory Staff has already a fine record and I am confident that it will continue to add to its good reputation and usefulness. 9. I am enclosing spare copies of this letter or you to send to your Assistant Political Advisers and Deputy Assistant Political Advisers. (Signed) Kinahan Cornwallis.THxA to © Copy THE POLITICAL ADVISORY STAFF 1.. The Political Advisory Staff will work directly under my orders through the Oriental Secretary. For the purposes of its work the country will he divided into three areas:- a) Northern area, the Li was of Mosul, Arbil, Kirkuk, Sulaimani and Diyalah. Headquarters will he at Kirkuk. h) Central area, the Liwas of Dulaim, Bagdad, Hillah, Kerhala, Diwaniyah, Kut, Amarah. Headquarters will he in Bagdad. c) Southern area, the Liwas of Basra and Nasiriyah. Headquarters will he in Basra. 2. . The staff will he shown on the strength of C.I.C.I. and all questions of pay, establishment, etc. will he arranged hy C.I.C.I. 3. Its duties will he a) Military h; Political. 4. Its military duties will he a) to keep in close touch with local military commanders, h) to arrange for co-operation of civil authorities with local military commanders, c) to establish good relations between the civil population and the British forces, d) to inform local military commanders of political developments and events in so far as they affect the, military situation and to give them any topographical or other information which they may require. e) to accompany military columns when necessary, after first obtaining my approval. 5. Political Duties The main duty of the Political Admisory Staff will he to fight Nazi influence in all its forms in this country, to prevent the possibility of the recurrence of another rising against us and to make such preparations as are possible to meet a German advance. It is difficult to define in exact detail how these objects are to he attained and I wish Political Advisors to have a wide discretion. A month ago this country was completely in the hands of fifth columnists and although the arch- villians have fled, the machine remains with plenty of smaller villains to work it. Thanks to their intensive propaganda over a period of years, the Germans have created a hatred of us amongst certain classes which did not before exist and although temporarily eclipsed, it is obvious that they will, take the first opportunity to recover their position. I am determined to fight them wi all the means in our power and in this fight /theunfriendly influences* Pr6pagenda, both overt and covert; is another obvious and important line and Political Advisers should keep in close touch with Mr. Perowne and Mr. Bishop. Bribery is a third course. Political Advisers must use their own judgment in classifying those who are friendly, those who might be persuaded by one means or another to become friendly and those who are irrecoverable. I imagine that the second class is a very large one and that many can be converted. The above is an outline of the political duties of the Political Advisory Staff. Different districts will present varied problems and will have to be dealt with accordingly. Political Advisers must use their discretions. Such problems as the Army, the schools (especially in Bagdad) and Bagdad itself which is the centre from which the Axis propaganda has radiated are being given special attention and the question of propaganda (both overt and covert) is in the hands of the Public Relations Department of the Embassy. The political Advisory Staff is thus a part - and a most important part - of the organisation which has been set up to fight enemy influence. 6. Reports Prom the above it will be seen that the duties of Political Advisers do not clash in any way with_those of intelligence officers employed by C.I.C.I. Political Advisers will nevertheless collect a great deal of very useful intelligence and it will be reliable intelligence because it will be volunteered by reliable persons. They should therefore 1) Submit a short weekly report which should include a brief appreciation of the political situation in the area. A copy should be sent to C.I.C.I. and Mr. Edmonds. 2) Telegraph to me when necessary any important news. 3) Supply on request any special information which may be required by C.I.C.I., Mr. Edmonds or myself. 7. Special Reports Political Advisers should report to me weekly by D.O. letter on the progress of the anti-German campaign.Sir K. Cornwallis.

Dear Peel, Will you please refer to your official letter EXT 5044/41 of the 26th August, about the proposal that Captain Tandy should he appointed Vice-Consul at Basra while serving with the military authorities. We note that this proposal is based on the fear that if the Persians discovered that Tandy was on military duties, the position in Persia of military members of the Political Service as a whole might be compromised. In Syria and elsewhere we have ourselves seconded a number of consular officers for service with the military authorities, they hold military rank and so on, and we have no reason to suppose that the position either of the individual officers, or of the service as a whole is likely to be compromised thereby. Moreover, since the Government of India sent their telegram on this subject, our position vis a vis of the Persian Government has been radically altered by the entry of Imperial forces into Persia. It hardly seems necessary now to pay the same attention to the exaggerated susceptibilities of the Persian Government, and for all we know, Tandy may have left Basra and accompanied the occupying forces into Persia. Before taking a definite decision we should therefore be grateful if you would explain the practice as regards our own consular officers to the Government of India and ask them if they still wish to maintain their request in the altered circumstances, and whether Anticipate that Tandy's headquarters will remain INDIA OFFICE r/e ^ R.T. Peel, Esq., C.B.E., M.O.Captain M.P.O'C'-Tandy was appointed Vice-Consul at BVLskhlin May last, but was withdrawn by the Government of India at the end of July I and lent to the military authorities in Iraq for intelligence work. The Government of India have now telegraphed that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf advises that the Governor of Bushire has shown considerable interest in Captain Tandy's movements and that 'if it is discovered that Tandy is on military duties position of military politicals may be compromised in Persia”. After consultation with the Ambassador and the military authorities the Government of India suggest that Tandy, who has been frotAfryj -B-e attacheAto the Consul at Basra, should be formally appointed Vice-Consul there.

Persian- ^speaking Indian. His view is that Indians are inconspicuous and that more use could be made of them. The Minister at Tehran has reported tjiat, in connection with the large Tehran - i.ajvin water scheme, the Iranians are proposing to form a local company which would invite some prominent British specialist with two assistants to come and draw up flu scheme, specialists in Iran have alieudy been preparing plans for barrages etc., but there is good reason'to believe that the Shah does not want the wcrk to go to the Germans and would like tc interest the British. The Minister, who has been asixed tc furnish names cf possible specialists, suggests that a representative of 4 . essrs. Hughes and L,C .£.Caster, who carried out a water and drainage scheme for Athens, might be sent from Igypt with two first clues* assistants if the local company were to offer suitable ter-s. He further suggests that, if tiie salaries offeree by tlie company were inadequate, it would be worth while to make up the difference officially. The Government of India have telegraphed to Tehran-to to ask for details of the scheme in order to enable them to select men iri India if required. The Foreign Office are also looking: for. suitable experts. (e) The appointment of a permanent inspector of Consular Buildings^an$ Assistant Director of-Antiquities, Lan uage Officers/ Archaeologists, Naturalists, etc. The Political Resident remarks that Langugge Officers will meet with difficulty, and that the French have a monbpcli*- of archaeology.

Suggestions similar to, though less detailed than, those in Foreign (ffice telegram $ 0.262 have been put to the Government of India in India Office telegram Ho. 6668 of June 12th. This telegram expresses the view that any opportunity offered by the Afghan Government for introducing British subjects into the country should be shized, and that this policy should not be limited by considerations of expense orb,y the rigid restriction of our economic activities to the ore? $ east oi^kabul - - andehar line. Beference is made to: ft* (i) The question of ^employment by thO Afghan Government of British road engineers and * . f&gt; \ (ii)The desirability of attempting to introduce agents on the pretext of helping with bridges on the Herat - Kandahar road. India Office telegram Ho.69B5 of 18th June passed on to the Government'of India a suggestion made by the Middle Fast Ministerial Committee that suitable British officers with political or military experience in India or the l iddle East r ight usefulh.be employed in the Bagdad Tjubassy ^ to/*7 4-0 &lt;JV% to repcrt^and to obstruct German activities. The Government of Indie were asked tc put forward names of men in the following two categories who would be suitable and could be made available for this purpose:- (i) Serving or retired British officers, either in India or the United kingdom; ,, (ii) Shia Moslem officials now in India who could bemused for propaganda purposes. The Government of India have suggested postponing the consideration of (i) until the system of liaison officers for maintaining contact between the local military commanders and the civil officials in Iraq has been established. They say that they t.re at present unaware what their commitments will be under this system and what liaison officers will be required* : ith regard to (ii) the Government of India say that they will te able to find Shia loslem officials for the urpooe indicated, but suggest that this also should wait until the chief liaison officer is appointed and candiscuss with the ambassador how many of these officials are requirfed and whei&amp;er the;/ should be located. Meanwhile H*K.Ambassador at Bagdad has emphasised the very great importance of establishing some organisation which will enable him to establish and maintain contact with the tribes and the influential Jheikhs in various parte of the country. This would be done by appointing experienced political officers who know and have gained the friendship of the chief tribal leaders and by the generous employment of money. The political officers would keep the i mbessy informed of local political developments and eveqts, establish close and friendly relations/with the tribes, make propaganda and discourage the activities of enemy agents. As a first step the Ambassador with the support of the G.G*C. has as^ed for authority tc appoint for this work two experienced political lecturers whose land settlement contracts with the Iraqi Government have just expired and whom he intends tc attach to the British military forces in North and South Iraq.4. $&gt;2.£uJi/(}2 . the *c»mplime»te the 'J v- E: 3607 « U2&gt; ' * /&lt;5?&gt;if/. / ^ y . . , , ^ /7 k ' /[This telegram is of pajrtic'alar/secredy and should he retained ^ 7 ) Jbotuuk* 4.0* hy the authorised recii pient^aS d-JlgjL^assed on] t ty'/jL /jUA.oCtJ *£l9J4/'clS^ 2t+oCt&amp;.

It is most important to avoid unnecessary delay and I therefore strongly recommend that, if funds are not forthcoming from elsewhere, the Foreign Office should accept forthwith liability for pay and allowances of Aston and Lyon on our post particularly as their duties will be largely political and they will be acting under my direct [sic.? direction]. If I can find right man, I may find it necessary to ask approval for appointment of another senior officer and two or three junior officers. The title of Political adviser and assistant Political adviser (if appointed) soom suitable.

Although country is^now calm, at least superficially, and control of Iraqi Government appears to run throughout Iraq, it cannot by any means be maintained ohat it has rully succeeded in cons 9 lidating its position. Some progress is being made, but failure of Government, m spite of my repeated representations, to take sufficiently strong Aid positive action against Rashid Ali and Axis cells both m the civil administration, &gt; the army and _ elsewhere give me serious cause for anxiety. The Ministers are well intent!oned but weak and if I push them uoo hara may resign. Any show of hesitation by Iraqi Government will certainly be interpreted as weakness by the opposition and can only give encouragement to Axis supporters and discontented army elements to stage a come-back at uhe opportune moment. Bad news, especially from this or Middle East theatres of war would provide such encouragement. Nevertheless our troops here will continue to have stabilising effect and I sincerely hope that, all those which 'were allotted to Iraq will be sent^ as soon as possible* ^Iso* of first importance, is the establishment of some . , . organization which will enable me to establish ancy maintain contact with tribes and influential Sheikhs m various parts of the country. This aspect of our task appears to have been completely neglected m the ana iixis propaganda has been allowed to spread unhindered. ine intensive work of 4 years cannot be successfully combatted in a few days, but in my opinion it is not t 90 late to remedy this serious state of affairs by appointing experienced [?politicall officers who know and have gained the friendship of chief tribal leaders, and the generous employment of money. Without a real efiort of tbus kind which will at the same time strengthen the positional present Government, we shall never succeed in^securing a proper hold over public opinion in outlying districts. Support from that quarter will prove a valuable asset 11 we are to maintain and increase our prestige and influence ir Iraq.

Please telegraph your views and recommendations on personnel required for this purpose. Your report should cover the following points: (a) Should extra personnel be attached to your Legation or to British Consulates, or should new Consulates be opened? (b) Should British firms trading in Iran be asked to employ extra personnel at His Majesty^s Government T s expense? If so, which films? Position of Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, United Fingdom Commercial Corporation and Tehran Aircraft/9 Aircraft Factory is being considered separately. (c) ^ould it be possible to start subsidised lorry or bus service (e.g. extension of ftairn Line) between •Fagdad and Tehran, or between Tehran and India, or both? ~ ' /v (d) Would It be worth while offering^Iranian authorities the services of a British cotton’ expert, or some other expert, on fa-vo'tirable terms or free -~. of charge? . ^ (e) If we wish to arrange further infiltration, we might send out a permanent Inspector of Consular buildings, language officers, archaeologists, naturalists, etc. Have you any further suggestions?

The Persians and Afghans ha^rheen inclined, from fear of the U.S.S.R.,* to look to G^many for support and we should use every means., to endeavor’ to induce them to throw in their lot with us.- In discussion, it was pointed out that our policy, towards pan-Arah and Syrian/aspirations had recently heen.. ;/ clearly and authoritatively defined hy the Foreign . , Secretary.

A reply was awaited from the M # A.P. to the representations which had been made for the supply of the required material and the view was expressed that a higher priority should be given to the despatch of the small quantity of material required for the manufacture of Hurricane aircraft* The suggestion was made that officials of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and /of the British firms operating in Iran might be encouraged to co-operate more vigorously with the anti—Axis activities of our political authorities in that country. As regards' - propaganda in Southern Persiaj THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that we should have to be cautious in our employment of Indians for political work,, owing to the risk of offending the Shah, who was always suspicious of any suggestion of political interference from India. Reference was made to the activities of German technical personnel in Iran and the suggestion was made that, in order to encourage the reception of the Persian . broadcasts of the B.B.CU, suitable wireless receiving sets should be distributed at very low prices to persons capable of influencing Iranian opinion. A' k. AFGHANISTAN .

Thomas should be employed either as head of a Mission in Southern Iraq or in India.- The telegram from India of May 26th referred to at the end of the cable seems to have been addressed to the C.in-C. Middle East and was not repeated to this country; it presumably referred to some military appointment lor which Mr. Thomas £&amp;* considered suitable. It is understood that, on the strength of this cable, the Vfar Office are getting into touch with him about his kit etc. with a view to getting him to Cairo as soon as possible. The chief interest of this Department in Mr. Thomas lies in the iact that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, with the approval of the Government of India, recommended him for the post ol Publicity Officer, Persian Gulf (see Government oi India's telegram Do.646 of 9th February and the Political Resident's telegram below it). At the end of their telegram the Government of India said that, failing Thomas, they would have to seek for this post an omcer from the Middle East Publicity Organisation. Now that, after a long delay, it is definitely known that Mr. Thomas will not be available, it seems necessary to find out whether the Government of India wish the Ministry of Information to be asked to help in pursuing this alternative possibility or in filling the post from elsewhere.

Cornwallis) received today it is clear further secret communication with him is impossible, and we presume he will have to remain in Baghdad to protect interests of British community in capital and North, and to maintain touch with other Legations and with de facto Government so far as possible. It follows that all measures for political and tribal management must be&amp;aken from G.0.C ? s Headquarters (now at Basra). G.O.C. has stressed urgent need for (? strengthening him with civil and political advisers. 3. We are making Galloway* now Political Agent, Kuwait* available as soon as Quinan arrives. We think however that more senior official is required and are consulting North West Frontier with a view to early despatch of Hay as chief political officer, who won considerable reputation in Iraq under Arnold Wilson and is well qualified by more recent experience. For inmedia te triba l cont acts we think best chance would be to extricate Slade and Domville and plac? them at Basra. Dickson, who will relieve Galloway in Kuwait, is (?well) (? qualified) for contacts with Shammar and other nomad tribes and in due course Thomas should be useful. Grice, Assistant in Iraqi Ministry of Interior, is now in India and we are approaching him and others. 4. We consider that we shall need funds up to £200,000 in gold for the present for subsidising tribes. We are sending at once £60*000 to General, Basra,and request that arrangements should be made to place at o\ir disposal remaining £150*000 at earliest possible moment. A separate telegram concerning procedure in this connexion will follow tomorrow. 5. Organisation on civil side will have to be Improvised. We visualise two branches: (a) Administrative, (b) Tribal bureau* both controlled by Hay acting under General* Basra. (a) would then be under Galloway and (b) under Blade, if available. Tribal Bureau would contact both settled and nomad tribes. Importance of latter is sufficiently indicated by Jedda telegram 144, May 4th. India Office, please to War Office. REC». POL.
