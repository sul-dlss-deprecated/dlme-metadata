The history of the area prior to 1907 will be found in Lorimer's 'Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.' Separate compilations have been prepared of the Treaties and Agreements between Her Majesty's Government and the Gulf Rulers and of the oil concession agreements entered into by the Rulers. The preparation of a compilation of the Civil Air Agreements between Her Majesty s Government and the Rulers has been postponed until negotiations which are pending in three of the States have been completed. The present compilation opens with a brief General chapter followed by chapters on Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, the Trucial States and Muscat. Each of these five chapters is divided into a number of sections dealing with the general situation, internal affairs, boundary questions and cognate matters, oil and relations with other States, and at the end of each chapter there is a Miscellaneous ' section covering a variety of special subjects. The Appendices referred to in the narrative and genealogical tables are contained in a separate volume. A map will be found at the end of this volume. The narrative has been brought down to the end of 1953 and subsequent developments of importance have been briefly indicated in the footnotes. The object of the compilation is to provide the background of current problems in the Gulf States, and precedents which, it is hoped, may be of use in dealing with future problems. On this account it has been necessary to deal at length with some matters, which although at first sight of minor importance, are liable to prove troublesome to those who have to handle them. For the most part Lorimer's spelling of Arabic names has been adopted. The 'ain however has only been shown by an apostrophe where otherwise in English two vowels might be pronounced as a diphthong, e.g., Sa'id. 18636 46639( iv ) Most of the footnote references are to Foreign Office tiles. , fet of abbreviations used in sueh references.

In 1928 the Political Resident was responsible to and corresponded direct with the Colonial Office on questions affecting Ibn Saud and the political aspects of the Arab littoral of the Gulf; in his capacity as Consul-General Bushire he was directly responsible to the Foreign Office; he acted as a liaison between His Majesty's Minister at Tehran and affairs in the Gulf which were of interest to His Majesty's Government as affecting their relations with Persia; and he was directly responsible to the Government of India for the internal affairs of the States of the Arab littoral and for keeping them in touch with affairs generally in South Persia and the Gulf.C) At that time there was a Middle East Department in the Colonial Office which was responsible amongst other things for dealings with the High Commissioner in Iraq. In 1932, after the British Mandate in Iraq had come to an end, the Colonial Office wished to divest itself of responsibility for Persian Gulf affairs, but there was a long dispute whether the Foreign Office or the India Office should take this over. The Cabinet finally decided in favour of the latter and in July 1933 the India Office took over the responsibilities in respect of the Persian Gulf previously discharged by the Colonial Office.( 2 ) A British Legation was opened in Jedda in 1929 and in 1931 the Political Resident ceased to have any responsibility for dealings with Ibn Saud.O With the transfer of the Residency from Bushire to Bahrain in 1946 he ceased to be Consul-General Bushire and to have any responsibility for Persian affairs. On April 1, 1947, when the transfer of power in India was imminent His Majesty's Government assumed responsibility for all Gulf affairs except that the posts there continued to be administered by the Government of India until the end of March 1948. For this year His Majesty's Government's responsibility was exercised through the Commonwealth Relations Office, but on April 1, 1948 the Foreign Office assumed full control. 2. When the Historical Summary of Events of 1917-1925 was compiled it was foreseen that the question of the removal of the Political Resident from Bushire was likely to be raised. O The matter became a live issue in 1929 and early in 1930 His Majesty's Government decided to put the proposal into effect partly in their own interests and partly as a bargaining counter to use in negotiations with the Persians, and not because of any demand received from them.( 5 ) The Persians were informed of the proposal and of certain conditions attached to it. It was considered that the Political Resident should make his new headquarters at Bahrain and the Ruler when consulted about this tentatively said he would feel honoured by the presence of the Residency at Bahrain.C) The Persians were not willing to accept the conditions proposed to them and the matter remained in abeyance until 1936. It was however agreed between His Majesty's Government and the Govern ment of India that the Political Resident should in Persia bear the title of His Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire and that he should restrict the use of his title of Political Resident to the Arab side of the Gulf. In 1936 it was again decided in principle to effect the transfer of the Political Residency to Bahrain and the main stumbling-block was the cost of the operation. The Ruler of Bahrain was again informed and had ' the pleasure and honour to agree to whatever the High British Government approve.'T) Lengthy discussions followed regarding the incidence of expenditure on the transfer, the Government of India agreeing to bear only a small proportion of it. Plans for a new Residency were prepared and a site for it selected on Muharraq Island but after the outbreak of war in 1939 it was agreed that the move of the Residency should be postponed.( 8 ) 0) Para. 5 at p. 40, P.G. 13.

In September 1946 the Cabinet decided that the conduct of relations with the Gulf States should be taken over from the Government oi India but did not decide which Department of His Majesty's Government should assume this responsibility. The choice lay between the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office. In January 1947 the Cabinet agreed that the India Office (which was shortly afterwards merged in the Commonwealth Relations Office) should take over the responsibility as an interim measure from April 1, 1947, and that this responsibility should be transferred to the Foreign Office when the latter were ready to take it over, the aim being to make this transfer by April 1, 1948.( ) The Government of India concurred in these proposals so far as they were concerned. In June 194/ all the Gulf Rulers including the Sultan of Muscat were informed m writing that owine to the constitutional changes that were about to take place in India it had been decided that in future His Majesty's Government would maintain re ations with them direct. The same officers would for the present conduct these relations (and would at the same time represent the Government of India) but they would act under the direct orders of His Majesty's Government to whom the Political Resident would be responsible.C 1 ) It may be noted here that although the Political Resident signed the letter to the Sultan of Muscat on this subject and has trequent dealings with him his position is nowhere recognised in any treaty or agreement with Muscat. 5 Since 1948 the Residency and its subordinate offices have been reorganised so as to conform to the Foreign Office pattern. For the most part Indian Political Service Officers have been replaced by Foreign Service Officers and Indian staff by British. No change has been made in the position of the Political Resident who remains responsible for the control of the Political Agencies and the Muscat Consulate except that the Political Agent at Kuwait now deals with the Foreign Office direct on certain subjects (chapter 3, paragraph 8). The Residency staff has been strengthened by the addition of a Financial Counsellor and a Commercial Secretary. Sanction for the appointment of a Medical Adviser and Chief Quarantine Medical Officer was granted in 1948 on a temporary basis and has been renewed from time to time since, but the appointment has not been made permanent.C 2 ) 6. The Political Resident is a Judge of the Chief and Full Courts under the Orders in Council but since 1949 an experienced Judge has been appointed to relieve him of most of his judicial work. As Foreign Service officers in most cases lack the judicial experience of the previous Indian Political Services officers, arrangements have been made to give them judicial training, whenever possible, before they take up appointments in the Gulf. 7. In defence matters the Political Resident deals with the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf who is subordinate to the Commander in Chief, East Indies, the Senior Army Officer, Persian Gulf who is subordinate to the Commander in Chief, Middle East Land Forces and the Senor Royal Air Force Officer, Persian Gulf who is subordinate to the Air Officer Commanding Royal Air Force at Habbaniyah in Iraq. In 1951 a Local Defence Committee was set up with the ( 9 ) The Political Resident's house was completed and occupied in April 1954. ( 10 ) (E 3022/66/G of 1947.) C 1 ) 1.0. to P.O.

Under an arrangement made soon after the First World War, which is known as the Welby Agreement, expenditure in the Persian Gulf was to be divided equally between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India except with regard to Bahrain and Muscat, which were to be supported by the Government of India. The latter sought a revision of this arrangement in 1937 in connection with the contemplated transfer of the Residency but their proposals do not appear to have been accepted.( 16 ) One result of the arrangement is that when His Majesty's Government assumed control of the Gulf posts in 1947 the Bahrain Agency and Muscat Consulate buildings and half the Kuwait Agency building were the property of the Government of India. The Bahrain Agency building has since collapsed and it is proposed to demolish it. No final settlement has yet been reached with the Governments of India and Pakistan regarding these and other assets which His Majesty's Government took over when the control of the Gulf ports was transferred.( 17 ) It was at one time feared that the Government of India might claim the right to occupy the buildings, especially the Muscat Consulate, but no such claim has yet been made. II.—General Policy with regard to the Shaikhdoms 9. In 1939 Sir Trenchard Fowle, when he had been Political Resident for nearly seven years, wrote as follows; ' Our ' rule' over the Arab States of the Gulf rests on the goodwill of the Rulers and their peoples This goodwill depends on three main factors. First—the fact that as far as possible we let the Rulers and their people, under our guidance and advice, manage their own affairs in their own way. Second—the fact that in our various negotiations with the Rulers, in which of course their peoples are interested, on the subject of oil, air facilities and so forth, we give them a patient hearing and a square deal. Third—and most important—the Rulers and their peoples realise that it is only His Majesty's Government who protect them from absorption by their stronger neighbours.'( 18 ) 10. In 1948 His Majesty's Government, after taking over full responsibility of the Gulf States, had to decide whether— {a) to continue the policy of not intervening except when compelled, or {b) to introduce a policy of more direct administration approaching the colonial model, or (c) without introducing colonial methods to intensify their efforts to promote good administration, social progress, and economic development through the existing Rulers and administrative machinery, largely by means of British advisers and technicians in the service of the Rulers. They chose the last course.( 19 ) 11. In 1951 His Majesty's Government expressed the following views on the policy to be followed in dealing with the Shaikhdoms: — (i) The practical possibility of achieving any form of general political federation of the Shaikhdoms (as opposed to a local federation of the Trucial States) is remote. The Rulers should, however, be encouraged to consult together on matters of regional concern such as education and health. ( 13 ) P.R. toF.O. 1094/8Gof June 9 5 1951 (EA 1195/4/Gof 1951).

E 8863/605/G of July 2, 1948.(ii) It is undesirable to attempt to bring the Shaikhdoms more closdy under the control of His Majesty's Government, but Hs Majesty s Government being responsible for the foreign relations ot Shaikhdoms have both the right to intervene to P reve ^ s ^ lous maladministration and to ensure that their international commitments are carried out, and the obligation to assist generally in the development of their administrative systems. , i , r . a tu* (in) The internal independence of the Shaikhdoms should be fosteied to the greatest possible extent. Although the goal of complete independence may not be obtainable in the near future it should not be lost sight ot as the ultimate purpose. ,u f . (iv) It is the function of His Majesty's Government to encourage the reroims for which a demand is likely to arise and to ensure that they develop on sound lines.('') . . These views applied chiefly to Bahrain and Kuwait and m some respects to Qatar. A separate pronouncement was made regarding the Trucial States (chapter 5, paragraph 8). 12. Sir Roger Makins in his report on the visit which he paid to the Persian Gulf in 1952 expressed the opinion that Her Majesty's Government must, in the absence of any satisfactory alternative, maintain their position in the Gulf and that this policy could be carried out in the following way: — ' (i) by maintaining close personal relationships between the political representatives and the Rulers; (ii) by making sure that we are consulted in the appointment ol British advisers; (hi) by maintaining our judicial functions and ensuring that they are adequately discharged; (iv) by our willingness to spend money on such things as the Trucial Oman Levies which demonstrate that we intend to stay and to adopt a positive policy; (v) by our readiness to give responsibility in all internal matters (and possibly in some matters of foreign relations as well) to the local administrations as they become capable of taking it; (vi) at the same time by maintaining our protection and, as a result, our right to intervene in the last resort in the case of gross maladmini stration.'^ 21 ) 13. In the instructions issued to the new Political Resident in 1953 the following policy was laid down: — (i) Her Majesty's Government should maintain the traditional position of Great Britain in the Gulf and continue to fulfil the obligations which they have assumed in that area. (ii) Her Majesty's Government should exert sufficient influence in the Shaikhdoms to ensure that there is no conflict between the policies of the Rulers and their own policies. (iii) Where appropriate Her Majesty's Government will endeavour to advance the internal independence of the Shaikhdoms. (iv) Her Majesty's Government' will not oppose any political or economic association between the Shaikhdoms provided it is consistent with the policies defined under (i) and (ii) above. In the Trucial States a common administration would appear to be highly desirable. (v) The intrusion of the direct influence of other Powers into the Shaikhdoms is unwelcome. In particular, the extension of the influence of the Arab League countries must be resisted. (vi) It is essential to harmonise United States and British policy without sacrificing the paramount British position. The closest personal relations must be maintained in the Gulf States between the British and United States official, service and business communities. (vii) It is essential to foster the closest relations between British officials and the members of the ruling families. Special effort must also be made to keep in touch with opinion in all classes of society. (viii) The expenditure and investment of the Ruler's incomes is a matter of direct interest to Her Majesty's Government. ( 20 ) F.O. to P.R. Despatch 48 (EA 1511 /1) of April 2, 1951. ( 21 ) Para. 24 at p. 11. Sir R. Makins' report.(?) Vv % (ix) The standard of administration and justice in the Shaikhdoms must be constantly improved. In particular an advance must be made in the Trucial States. (x) The maintenance of good relations with Saudi Arabia is highly desirable and solutions must be sought to outstanding disputes. (xi) The oil companies must be free to develop their concessions. Their relations with the States must be kept under close review at all times. (xii) The facilities enjoyed by Her Majesty's forces must be maintained.( 22 ) The question of Anglo-American relations in the Persian Gulf referred to in item ^(vi) above is dealt with in the chapter on Bahrain (Chapter 2, paragraphs 14. In 1951 His Majesty's Government, in discussing the question of jurisdiction, expressed the view that the ultimate aim in the Shaikhdoms should be to unify the two systems now in existence, i .e., the Courts set up under the Orders in Council and the Rulers' Courts, so that there should be only one set of Courts which would be those of the Rulers, though it was admitted that this was a long- term policy. In the short term it was necessary to encourage the development of the local judicial systems and to improve the Order in Council systems so that both might be better equipped to meet modern requirements. It was proposed that the law existing or evolved for the Courts established under the Orders in Council should be applied in the Joint Courts so that these might become an avenue through which improvements could be achieved in the Rulers' Courts. In the matter of legislation on subjects of common concern to persons subject to both sets of Courts, the view taken was that the Rulers' laws and the Regulations issued under the Orders in Council should be similar in form as well as in subject A law should first be made by the Ruler and then applied by King's Regulation to persons subject to the Order in Council concerned. As the success of this method was dependent on the acceptance by the Rulers of the assistance of His Majesty's Government in the drafting of their laws it was considered desirable that not only should the tradition of assisting in the drafting of laws be established but that the Rulers should be encouraged to improve their judicial and legislative machinery by such measures as the employment of British legal advisers.( 23 ) 15. In 1945(' 1 ) and again in 1950 the Political Resident raised the question of the right of His Majesty's Government to sign international agreements on behalf of the Rulers without consulting them with special reference to the Chicago Air Agreements, under which it is in fact claimed that the Gulf Shaikhdoms are United Kingdom territory for civil aviation purposes. On the latter occasion the views of His Majesty's Government were that whenever possible the Rulers should be consulted and their consent obtained before any international agreements were entered into on their behalf, because His Majesty's Government's rights in the sphere of internal affairs were limited and because of the embarrassment that might be caused if they went beyond their agreement with the Rulers.( 25 ) Prior consultation might not, however, always be possible and His Majesty's Government's position as Protecting Power required that the Rulers should in the last resort be prepared to be guided by them and accept their advice. Legally the validity of the international obligations accepted in respect of the Shaikhdoms was not affected by failure to consult the Rulers first. It was thus held that His Majesty's Government and the Rulers were committed to carry out the terms of the Chicago Agreements in respect of the Gulf Shaikhdoms and indeed the terms of 16 other multilateral agreements signed since 1945 which were deemed applicable to the Shaikhdoms, though subsequently the number of these was reduced to three.( 2ti ) It was suggested that the position should be explained to the Rulers of Bahrain and Kuwait but the Political Resident was opposed to this. The three agreements other than the Chicago Agreements held to be applicable to the Shaikhdoms were— (i) the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1949, (ii) the International Monetary Fund Agreement of 1945,' and (iii) the Bermuda Telecommunications Agreement of 1945.

III.—The Arab League and the Guit Shaikhdoms 16 The Arab League has not taken as much interest in the Gulf States as might be expected and has made no frontal attack on th ® ? ritlS • Gulf In 1952 Sir Roger Makins reported that there were no obvious s g .• i- t • States of the influence of the League but that he had no doubt that n feeling was not far below the surface.O Later in the y®' ment considered that they could not ignore the danger ^ h® Arab League might turn to the Persian Gult when they had exliaustea i nossibilities of Tunisia, Morocco, the Anglo-Egyptian dispute and other similar oretexts for aeitation.D In 1953 the Secretary-General of the League was reported fo have staled to the press that it was hoped that the Gulf Shaikdoms would shortly contribute to the strengthening of the League and that the legal aspec of ^ question was being considered so that the obstacles which hindered theGulfStates from having relations with the League might be overcome.! ) The Assistant Secretary-General subsequently stated that it was the League s intention to leave all political questions aside and to endeavour to establish closer cultural, educational and similar relations with the Shaikdoms.( ) 17 In 1951 as a result of the attendance of representatives from Bahrain and Kuwait at an Arab League Educational Conference (para. 19 below) it was agreed between the Political Resident and the British Middle East Office that there would be no benefit in requesting the Arab League to pass invitations to the Gulf Rulers through the British authorities, as this might prompt them to take steps intended onlv to annoy His Majesty's Government, and that it was undesirable to insist on the Rulers passing their replies to such invitations through the British authorities. The Rulers should however be induced to refer all communications received by them from the League to the British authorities and to accept the latter's advice.f 3 ) 18. In 1953 Her Majesty's Government issued instructions that the Ruler of Kuwait should be informed with particular reference to the Arab League that it was not their wish to prevent participation by Kuwaitis in any conference or organisation from which Kuwait might derive positive benefits, but that in view of their responsibility for his foreign relations they expected both to be consulted about any invitation which he might receive to send representatives to an international conference or to join any international organisation, and to be given an opportunity to advise him in his own interests to accept or refuse. Replies to such invitations should properly be sent through the Political Agent.( 34 ) It was not considered necessary to say anything on the subject to any of the other Rulers, as Bahrain had shown no tendency to disregard the correct procedure and there was no evidence of any contact between the League and the other Shaikhdoms. The Ruler of Kuwait in reply promised to consult the Political Agent regarding any approach from outside on political matters, but said that he did not think a similar approach in medical or social matters warranted such action.( ') 19. There is no history of any relations between the Arab League and the Gulf Shaikhdoms until 1950 when both Bahrain and Kuwait accepted invitations to send a representative to an Educational Conference at Alexandria.

In 1951 the Arab League passed a resolution calling upon Arab States to take action to prevent oil reaching Israel, and the Rulers of Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar were asked to refer any appeal which they received direct from the League on this subject to the local political authority.( 36 ) Later a report was received that the League was proposing to send a delegation to Bahrain and Kuwait to discuss the question of preventing Arab oil from reaching Israel.( i7 ) No delegation materialised and there is no evidence that an appeal was received by any of the Rulers. In December 1952 Kuwait sent a delegation to Damascus to attend a United Nations Social Seminar, which was almost exclusively an Arab League Affair,( 38 ) without consulting or even informing the Political Agent. Early in 1953 the Secretary-General of the League wrote to the Ruler of Kuwait accusing Kuwait of being a bridge for trade with Israel.( !9 ) The Ruler, without consulting the Political Agent, replied denying the accusations and saying that Kuwait would play no such part. In August 1953 the Head of the Kuwait Education Department informed the Political Agent that he had received an invitation to send delegates to an Educational Conference at Alexandria. The Political Agent was asked to inform the Ruler that there was no objection to acceptance of the invitation and to ask that the reply to it should be sent through him.( 40 ) This does not appear to have been done. In October 1953 three members of the Sub-Committee of the Social Committee of the Arab League visited Kuwait and the Kuwait Oil Company and subsequently the Director of Education at Kuwait sent both the Kuwait Oil Company and the American Independent Oil Company a long questionnaire concerning labour relations and cognate matters, asking that a reply to it should be sent for research by the Central Committee of the League.( 41 ) The acting Ruler advised that no replies should be sent to this questionnaire. The delegations^ visit to Kuwait was made with Her Majesty's Government concurrence^ 42 ) They also proposed to visit Bahrain, but the Ruler asked that they should not be granted visas pending a reply to certain enquiries and as a result of the delay which this caused they abandoned their proposal. In December 1953 a Jedda newspaper stated that the Lebanese Government had announced that the League would shortly discuss Kuwait's application to join it. Beirut did not confirm this report and the Ruler of Kuwait denied all knowledge of it and repeated his statement that Kuwait would co-operate with the League in educational, social and medical matters but would have no dealings with it whatsoever on political or defence questions.^ ) IV.—Miscellaneous (a) The Persian Gulf Lighting Service 20. The administration of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service continued until 1948 on the lines described in the Historical Summary of Events, 1907-1928.( 44 ) General administration and financial control was exercised by the Government of India with the advice of a non-official advisory committee at Bombay, and the day-to-day operations of the service were carried out by the Basra Port Directorate which also collected the dues from which the service was maintained. ( 45 ) The Political Resident kept an eye on the operations and intervened when political considerations were involved. The Nearchus, which had been declared unfit for service in 1923,( 46 ) continued to function as lighthouse tender until 1952, being hired for the purpose from the Iraqi Government. During the last war she was fitted with accommodation for the Political Resident and was regularly used by him for his tours, when His Majesty's ships were not available for the purpose. n P.R. to F.O. 1066/18 of October 3, 1951 (EA 1261/7 of 1951).

In 1948 agreement was reached with the Gov ® r '! 1 [ 1 ^ t assetsC')'and Ae Majesty's Government shculd take over t e service an ^ XranS po r t assumed transfer took place on June 1, 1948, when tne •, , , b rd j n London, responsibility for its administration It was assisted by a cen e were on which shipping companies, including Umt ^ p St ^ t ug Gulf consisting of represented, and a local advisory^committee [ h e N representatives of the Political Residency, • y i on( j on board made Directorate and interested shipping companies. ,■ j t u e B aS ra recommendations to the Ministry of Transport on !^a'ers of policy and Ae Port Directorate continued to manage the operations and to coi ect aues^ ine Political Residency was the channel of communication between the ^ Transport on the one hand and the local committee and the Basra Fort Directorate on the other. ^2 While the administration of the service was in the hands of t e Government of India its funds were held as an informal ^ were not passed through the Indian Vote Accounts, nor were they published with the Indian Appropriations Trading Accounts. This informal procedure was possible in the United Kingdom and if the service was to continue to administered by the iMinistry of Transport the revenue and expenditure involved would have had to be dealt with through the normal vote procedure, with consequent loss of flexibility and convenience. For these and other reasons it was decided to form a company to administer the service with both commercial and Governmental participation. A company was accordingly incorporated in London on January 12, 1950, entitled 'The Persian Gulf Lighting Service (Appendix A (i)), to which the assets and the administration of the service were transferred ( 48 ) The Company is non-profit-making and is in the nature of a trust. Its revenue is derived from the light dues levied on a voluntary basis on shipping navigating in the Persian Gulf. While it is commercial in form it is subject to full Governmental control in all essential matters. The company has a main Board of Management in London. A Local Advisory Committee, which was reconstituted under the Articles of Association of the new company, retained much the same functions as before (Appendix A (ii)).( 49 ) A full-time Superintendent with headouarters at Bahrain was appointed. As a result of this appointment the Political Resident was relieved of all responsibility for the administration and finance of the service but he continued to be consulted when political issues were involved. 23. In 1952 a new lighthouse tender the Relume which had been specially constructed for the service replaced the Nearchus and was based on Bahrain. The Superintendent at Bahrain then took over local operational control of the service. Some of the service personnel continued to reside at Basra and in 1953 the Port Directorate there still supplied gas and technical services, but when new premises which are under construction at Bahrain are ready a complete transfer is to be effected. 24. Rules for the collection of light dues were issued by the Persian Gulf Light Service in 1950 and amended in 1951 (Appendix A (iii)). Although the Political Resident has powers under the Orders in Council for the Shaikhdoms to make regulations for the recovery of the dues no such regulations have yet been made and recovery is usually effected from the shipping companies or their agents without undue difficulty. An arrangement was made under the 1939 Treaty with Muscat for the payment of a contribution by the Muscat Government out of any dues recovered by them from shipping to cover the cost of lights maintained in Omani waters, but when the 1951 Treaty was being negotiated the Persian Gulf Lighting Service agreed that no action should be taken to obtain a contribution towards the cost of the Muscat light.( 50 ) 25. Up to date the Rulers have been given no say in the affairs of the service except that they are consulted when it is proposed to erect lighthouses or beacons in their territories, and in particular the recovery of dues from vessels which visit their ports is made without any sanction from them. In 1948 the Ruler of Bahrain ( 47 ) C.R.O. to F.O. Ext. 535/48 of February 25, 1948 (E 2766/175/91 of 1948). ( 48 ) M. of T. to F.O. M. 5909/49 of February 3, 1950 (EA 1401/11 of 1950).

Difficulties have also arisen about the representation of the United States Navy on the Committee. The United States Navy had declined to pay light dues on their contract-operated tankers, which are manned by civilian personnel, and it was decided that they should not be offered representation on the Committee until these dues were paid. It was, however, agreed that information should be sent to the United States Navy in the Gulf concerning all major matters affecting aids to navigation in the Gulf, that they might be invited to send a member to attend meetings of the Committee as an observer and that the matter would be considered again if a formal request was received from them for representation on the Committee.( 53 ) 27. In the days of the British Government of India the Nearchus while working for the Persian Gulf Lighting Service outside Iraqi waters used to fly a blue ensign defaced with the Star of India.( 54 ) This arrangement had been approved by the Iraqi Government. After the transfer of power in India she wore for a time the Indian and Pakistani flags, but after the service had been taken over by His Majesty's Government, the Iraqi Government refused to agree to her wearing a British flag and she wore the Iraqi flag on all occasions.( 55 ) In 1951 it was agreed that the service's flag should be a defaced blue ensign but that this should be flown only in the lighthouse tender, launches and other sea-going craft and possibly on the service's offices at Bahrain.( 56 ) The Political Resident did not consider it desirable that it should be flown on any lighthouse or light-vessel for fear of incidents of which serious notice might have to be taken. 28. During the last war and for some years after few new works had been undertaken but since the formation of the company in 1950 new lights have been installed on Farsi and Halul islands, a new light on Kubbar island is under construction, a radio beacon has been installed on Little Quoin Island and a number of improvements have been effected elsewhere. 29. From its earliest days the service maintained lights and buoys on both shores of the Gulf, and up to 1928 it had been found possible to prevent the Persians from interfering.( 57 ) In 1929 they proposed a conference with a view to their taking over control of the service in Persian waters. Nothing came of this but in 1933 they stated they were considering making arrangements for the management of the beacons and lighthouses in their territories and waters ( 58 ) and sent a Frenchman to inspect them including that on Tamb. In 1934 they informed His Majesty's Legation at Teheran that they wished to assume responsibility for lighting and buoying on their coast and that they proposed to purchase all existing installations except the Qais light-vessel. His Majesty's Government agreed in principle and a protocol was drafted and handed to Persian Government in 1936.( 59 ) Meanwhile proposals were considered for a new route for shipping which would avoid any dependence on lights for which the Persians were responsible. In 1937 the Persians decided not to buy any of the existing installations and asked for then- removal as their own installations became ready. In 1940 their lighthouses at Bushire and on Qais Island started to function, but with the Allied occupation of Persia in 1941 the question of the removal of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service installations was dropped. 30. In 1946 these installations consisted of some buoys at Bushire, a light- vessel off Qais Island and a lighthouse at Jask.( 60 ) The Persian Government had ( 51 ) Tel. from P.R. to F.O.

In I 950 , a j^bal request received from the Commandant of the Persian Southern Naval Forces tor the acquisition by the Persian Government of the two outer gas buoys at Bush ire the matter was not pursued. In 1952 the Persian authorities removedo^ofthe service's buoys at Bushire and replaced it with one of Aeir own. Her Majesty s Government saw no objection to the installation by the Persians of their o lighting at Bushire, provided they returned the service s property, and suggested that the matter should be taken up by the service through the Persian Consulate- General at Basra,r) but no further action appears to have been taken, presumably because of the breach of diplomatic relations with Persia. .Later m the year the Persians refused to allow the Relume to visit Bushire to service the buoys( ) and no attempt to resume this service had been made by the end of 1^3. in 1952 me service proposed to remove their buoy from Jask and to hand over the lighthouse there to the Persian Government^ 06 ) This proposal however was not proceeded with and the Relume continued to pay regular visits to Jask( ') up to the end ot without any previous notification to the Persian authorities and without any objection being raised by them. 31 In 1951 the Persian authorities made informal enquiries through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company whether the Persian Gulf Lighting Service would consider undertaking the maintenance of all their lights, and whether they could be represented on the service's Local Advisory Committee( e8 ) but neither proposal was pursued. In 1952 the question arose of the channel through which the Persian authorities should be notified of the relief of the Nearchus by the Relume, which was to be based in Bahrain, and of proposed visits by the latter to Persian waters Her Majesty's Government did not approve of a proposal that notification should be made through Her Majesty's Consulate-General at Basra, for fear that the service's operations might be impeded by political actions on the part of the Persians, and suggested that the Captain of the Relume should communicate with the Persian Consulate-General at Basra either direct or through the Basra Port Directorate in accordance with past practice.( 69 ) It was decided that for the time being communications should be made by the Captain of the Relume through the Basra Port Directorate! 70 ) to the Persian Consul-General at Basra,( 7L ) and that notification of visits to Persian waters should only be made where this had been customary before.( 72 ) It would appear that only visits to Bushire, Lingeh or Qishm had been so notified. 32. The Saudi Arabian Government have shown no desire to participate in the service's operations and have only interfered when the service has operated without their approval in what they considered as their territory. In 1938 they agreed to the service's complying with a request received from the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company (later the Arabian American Oil Company) for ( 61 ) P.R. to F.O. 135/70/50 of May 6, 1950 (EA 1401/27 of 1950).

In 1951 a proposal which they made for the erection by them {i.e., by the Arabian American Oil Company) of six lights to mark the Ras Tanura channels was agreed to on the understanding that this would not be treated as establishing the ownership by them of the sea-bed concerned and that they would raise no objection to the replacement of the light on Farsi Island by a more powerful oneC 4 ) In 1953 the service agreed to comply with requests received from the Saudi Government Railway and the Arabian American Oil Company for the servicing of lights belonging to them on the understanding that the servicing of their own navigational aids would take precedence and that they would be indemnified against any possible claim arising from operations carried out on behalf of the railway and the oil company.( 75 ) 33. The Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company (later the Arabian American Oil Company) agreed to pay for the servicing of buoys which the service was asked to instal in 1938 but were unwilling to pay a general contribution to the service's tund in India until the concurrence of the Saudi Arabian Government had been obtained. That Government at first proposed a formal agreement between themselves and the Government of India on the subject but in 1944 agreed to the matter being arranged direct between the company and the serviced 7 6 ) and a lump sum contribution was in due course recovered from the company. In 1948 when the Arabian American Oil Company were asked to pay regular light dues on the shipping calling at Ras Tanurah, for which they acted as agents, they thought it might be necessary to consult the Saudi Arabian Government before complying with the proposal^') It is not known whether such consultation took place, but no further dilfculty arose and in 1953 dues were being recovered from owners of ships visiting Ras Tanurah and Dammam by either the London office of the Service or Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company at Bahrain. {b) Currency and Exchange Control 34. The currency in general use in the Persian Gulf States is the Indian rupee. In Muscat the Maria Theresa dollar is also current and in the interior it is the only currency which is acceptable. There is also a small coin called the baiza. The Sultan in 1948 had a number of these minted and attempted to regulate their rate vis-a-vis the Indian rupee and the Maria Theresa dollar (chapter 6, paragraph 111). Apart from this there is no local legislation regarding currency in any of the Gulf States and there is nothing in the nature of legal tender. In 1947 the status of the rupee as the principal circulating currency of the Gulf was described by the Government of India as a purely commercial one and the banks were stated to have no statutory connections with the rupee or obligations in relation to rupee currency.( ) The British banks in Bahrain, Kuwait, Dohah, Dubai and Muscat and the Kuwait National Bank in Kuwait are ordinarily the only means of exercising any control over currency and exchange and have always shown themselves willing to co-operate with Her Majesty's ^Government in dealing with these matters. 35. Territories within the sterling area as defined by the Defence (Finance) Regulations issued at the outbreak of the Second World War and ' Scheduled Territories ' as defined by the Exchange Control Act of 1947 included ' any British Protectorate or British Protected State.'T) This definition covered all the Shaikhdoms but not Muscat, which has however been treated as administratively within the sterling area. The consent of the Rulers concerned to this arrangement was never sought but in 1947 the Commonwealth Relations Office considered that it might perhaps be implied, as they had made no complaints against the operation of foreign exchange restrictions. 36. At the end of 1947 a suggestion was made that the Persian Gulf should have its own currency but it was not seriously considered at the time. In April 1948 the Pakistan Government began to issue its own currency. The banks in the Q Tel. from Jedda to F.O. 131 of September 14, 1938 (E 5423/453/91 of 1938). ( ) Jedda to F.O.

This did not satisfy them and in August 1949 they sent official of their State Bank to Bahrain to examine the ^^f^PXrees of arrange for the Pakistan Government to meet part or all the repatriation cnarges 01 their currency provided it was treated on a par with the Indian rupee,( ) but the refusal of the Pakistan Government to devalue their rupee at the same time as sterling and the Indian rupee immediately after his visit made any arrangem of this kind impossible. 37. In 1949 a Treasury representative visited the Persian Gulf and recommended that no attempt should be made to persuade the Rulers to enact legislation making the Indian rupee the official currency but that a separate currency should be introduced in the Gulf.( 81 ) The latter proposal was not accepted for the time being by His Majesty's Government as negotiations were ^ the time in progress with the Government of India for the replacement of the Tnman rupee by the East African shilling in Aden and it was feared that these would be jeopardised by a proposal that the Indian rupee should also be replaced in the Gult. The Political Resident pressed the matter further but was informed that the outcome of the negotiations regarding Aden must be awaited and that meanwhile the matter should not be raised with the Rulers or anyone else .r) 38. A new currency was introduced in Aden in October 1951 and the Political Resident again pressed for the introduction of a new Gulf currency. His Majesty s Government decided that the time was inopportune for a change owing to the weakness of sterling.( 8G ) Sir Roger Makins, after visiting the Persian Gulf in the spring of 1952 reported that with the arrangements that had been or were being made for oil revenues to be paid in sterling the currency question was becoming of smaller importance and that there appeared to be no demand in the States tor any change ( 87 ) At the beginning of 1953 the Political Resident suggested that the currency question should be taken up again if the Reserve Bank of India continued to make difficulties about the repatriation of rupee notes from the Gulf States,( ) a step which they took in an endeavour to stop the smuggling of gold into India (chapter 3, paragraph 159). A Bank of England representative who visited Kuwait in February found 0 himself compelled to discuss the currency question with officials of the Kuwait Finance Department and others and reported strongly in favour of a new currency.( 89 ) The Ruler of Kuwait consulted the local business community on the subject and subsequently informed his officials that he had found opinion so divided that he felt he* could not even ask Her Majesty's Government for advice about it.( 90 ) Much discussion and correspondence followed and at a departmental conference which took place in London in August 1953 it was generally agreed that: — {a) if practicable, a new currency should be a Persian Gulf currency rather than, say, a Kuwait currency; {b) such a currency could only be introduced by Her Majesty's Government who would require to take the initiative; (so) Tel. from P.R. to F.O. 108 of June21, 1948 (E 8546/115/91 of 1948).

During the Second World War and until the transfer of power in India, exchange control in the Persian Gulf was exercised by the Reserve Bank of India at Bombay which issued instructions to the local banks for releases of foreign exchange recommended by the political authorities to cover imports within quotas which had been sanctioned by the Government of India.( 94 ) On August 15, 1947 responsibility for exchange control was transferred to the Political Resident. The machinery since used for it has been the issue of ' letters of recommendation ' by the Political Agent concerned or Her Majesty's Consul at Muscat authorising the banks to carry out the exchange transactions described in them. The letters are issued in accordance with general instructions received from time to time from Her Majesty's Government, and the Bank of England keeps a careful eye on the system. At first a letter of recommendation was required for every foreign exchange transaction and could only be granted for essential imports, but by the end of 1952 it had been possible to free from these formalities payments for nearly all imports from countries other than those in the dollar area. Payments in dollars are very sparingly authorised and only for essential goods and services. The exchange control applies to transactions affected through the banks {i.e., in ' official ' exchange) only and in the markets there are no exchange restrictions. (c) Slavery 40. The extent to which slavery still exists and is recognised in the Gulf States is described in the ensuing chapters. A general report on the subject, so far as the Shaikhdoms are concerned, was submitted by the Political Resident in 1952.0 Generally speaking the position is that there is now no import of slaves from other countries except perhaps very occasionally from Persian Baluchistan, that local abductions take place from time to time on the Trucial Coast and in Muscat territory, and that domestic slavery is still firmly entrenched on the Trucial Coast and in Muscat but has been abolished in Qatar and is not officially recognised in Bahrain and Kuwait. In all the States including Kuwait, with which Her Majesty's Government has no agreement for the suppression of the traffic in slaves, the right of manumission is exercised by the Political Agent or Consul in accordance with rules prescribed by the Residency (Appendix B). This right is not specifically recognised in any of the agreements with the Rulers but has not been called in question by them. {d) Arms 41. The arms traffic was a major issue during the period covered by the agreed Historical Summary of Events 1907-1928( 9fi ) but little has been heard of it since. Its local aspects are dealt with in the following chapters. The Political Resident 0 submitted a report on the subject as a whole in 1951 and expressed the opinion that it was still necessary to control the traffic in arms in order (i) to prevent arms reaching the tribes of the hinterland especially in Muscat and the Trucial Shaikhdoms and (ii) to prevent the illicit supply of arms to neighbouring countries such as Iraq and Persia. His Majesty's Government agreed with these views but pointed out that they were not under any international obligation to control the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf.( 97 ) ( 91 ) (EA 1116/31 of 1953.)

The rules observed by officers of the Roval Navy and a Table of Precedence are appended (Appendix U). lite procedure for calls between Political officers and Rulers varies from post to post. It is usual for political officers to call on the Rulers on the two Ids and for the Rulers to call on the local political authority on Her Majesty s birthday which ts celebrated on April 21, and New Year's Day or Christmas Day A list of the Rulers with their titles, decorations and salutees as they stood at the end 01 ISoi k annended (ADpendix E).

In the days of the British Government of India the PoUtica^^esldent was given the title of the ' The Hon'ble.'' Since 1948 he has been entitled ' His Excellency.' The gun salutes enjoyed by the Political Resident and other officers in the Gulf ports are given in the Table of Precedence ( Appendix D) 44 The Political Resident is entitled to fly the diplomatic flag and other heads of posts the consular flag. These flags are flown daily. British subjects and protected persons are permitted to fly the Union Jack on specified occasions (Appendix G (i)). Each Gulf State has its flag and ships other than men of war visiting a State usually fly its flag at the foremast.( 101 ) Bahrain is the only State which has issued rules about the flying of flags (Appendix G (ii)). These rules have not been applied by Regulation to persons subject to the Order in Council. D Washington to F.O. 11931/4/53 of June 30, 1953 (EA 1194/2 of 1953) ( 91! ) F.O. to Brussels.

Shaikh Isa bin Ali who had been relieved of control of the administration of Bahrain in 1923( l ) survived until 1932. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son Hamad who had been Deputy Ruler since his deposition, and had been recognised as heir apparent in 1899.( 2 ) Hamad died in February 1942 and messages of condolence were sent to his family by His Majesty's Government, but not by His Majesty as recommended by the Political Resident^ ) and by the Viceroy. His eldest son Salman the present Ruler was accepted by the ruling family as his successor, while he was still on his death-bed; and was at once recognised by His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, and a Kharita containing the Viceroy's congratulations was handed to him by the Political Resident at a formal ceremony held in Bahrain in April 1942. He was not required to give any kind of undertaking but in an interview with the Political Agent two days after his father's death orally promised (1) loyally to preserve the existing ties of friendship with His Majesty's Government, (2) to respect the rights both of members of his family and of his individual subjects and (3) to promote the public welfare by all means in his power. He also expressed his determination to be loyal to the British connection and to implement all undertakings given by the previous Rulers of Bahrain, and he spontaneously offered to be guided by any advice which the Political Agent might tender to him.C) 2. Hamad had been granted on his accession a personal salute of four guns in addition to his dynastic salute of seven guns and the same salute was granted to Salman on his accession. In 1950 the total salute was increased to thirteen guns. It has since been recommended that the distinction between the personal and dynastic salutes enjoyed by the Ruler of Bahrain and other Gulf Rulers should be abolished and that all the salutes should be regarded as dynastic,( 5 ) but no orders have yet been passed on this recommendation. The title of His Highness was accorded to Hamad in 1937 and made dynastic. Salman was awarded an honorary K.C.I.E. in 1943 and an honorary K.C.M.G. in 1952. He was born about 1894. He takes an active part in the day to day business of his State and is genuinely interested in the welfare of his people, though jealous of his own and his family's position. He possesses some education but knows no English. He is usually sensible but there are certain subjects especially those affecting his relations with Qatar on which he is quite unable to take a balanced view and in recent years he has shown defects of temper possibly due to over-work. He appears genuinely attached to the British connection and made a very good impression when he visited the United Kingdom for Her Majesty's Coronation in 1953. 3. Salman has two uncles alive, Muhammad and Abdullah. The former spends much of his time travelling and though prominent socially plays no part in State affairs. Abdullah is Minister of Education and President of the Manamah Municipality. He was formerly regarded as dangerous and his deportation was considered in 1923.( 6 ) He probably now has no personal ambitions but is still active and is frequently consulted by Salman. His advice is usually sensible. Only three of Salman's seven surviving brothers, Mubarak, Abdullah and Daij, take any part in the public life of Bahrain. Salman has three sons the eldest of whom, Isa, was born in 1933. He is insignificant in appearance and only partially educated but otherwise appears eligible for the succession. 4. Before Hamad died he made a will in which he nominated Salman as his successor. As this was not in accordance with Arab custom he kept the matter secret and deposited one copy of the will with the Political Resident and another with the Eastern Bank. On his death the ruling family unanimously selected Salman as his successor and the will was only produced to confirm their selection when it had been made.( 7 ) The question of the succession is at present entirely open i 1 ) Para. 14 at p. 64, P.G. 13.

The Ruler in replying undertook that he ^d^s succe wou?d always faithfully observe all existing engagements (Appendix A , wasaskednot o allow the correspondence to become public and promised to trea it as secreU ) Apart from this in 1932 His Majesty's Government agreed to a modification of Article 4 of the Convention of 18 61 £ 0 ) so as duties being levied in excess of 5 per cent, ad valoremX ) in l^U me Kuier asKea for the modification of a provision in the same article that British subjects might reside in and carry on their lawful trade in the territories of Bahrain.( ) No modification was made but it was proposed that the Bahrain Government should be consulted on all cases before a Residence Permit was granted under a Regulation which was in draft form at the time and which was issued in the following year.( ) The Ruler protested strongly when this Regulation came to his notice because it authorised the Political Agent to give Residence Permits to persons subject to the Order in Council and he considered that this was his prerogative. He was given an assurance that his Government would be consulted about all applications for residence permits by persons subject to Her Majesty's jurisdiction for the purpose of setting up business in Bahrain.C) 6. From Isa's deposition until 1928 the Political Agent was the virtual ruler of Bahrain ( 15 ) Hamad was indolent and took little interest in State affairs and from 1928 until his death in 1942 Mr. C. (now Sir Charles) Dalrymple Belgrave, who had been appointed Financial Adviser in 1926, so far as internal administration was concerned was to all intents and purposes the ruler of the State. Salman, as already noted takes a much closer interest in affairs than his father and though he trusts Belgrave who is still Financial Adviser, he exerts his own authority m matters both great and small and the latter now takes second place. In addition to a British Financial Adviser a British Director of Customs and a number of British doctors engineers and other experts are employed by the Bahrain Government and the general state of its administration is generally admitted to be second to none in the Middle East. In 1931 it was reported that Bahrain was becoming more and more the centre of the Gulf and its good administration and the state of security that prevailed attracted to it businessmen from the United Kingdom, Arabia, Persia and India. Its importance was still further increased by the transfer to it of the British Naval Base in the Persian Gulf in 1935 and of the Persian Gulf Political Residency in 1946. 7. A British Political Agent has resided in Bahrain since 1904 and since 1934 there has also been an Assistant Political Agent. The entire cost of the Agency except in respect of the suppression of the slave-trade and of sanitary arrangements was until 1947 borne by the Government of India.( 1G ) When the Foreign Office took over responsibility for the Persian Gulf posts in 1948 it was proposed that the Persian Gulf Residency and the Bahrain Political Agency should be amalgamated and that a Deputy Political Resident should perform the functions of Political ( 8 ) Para. 2 at p. 61, P.G. 13.

When, however, Sir Roger Makins visited the Persian Gulf in 1952 he recommended that the separate identity of the office of Political Agent, Bahrain, should be preservedi 17 ) and this policy at present holds the field. In 1952 the building which housed both the Political Agent and his office collapsed and temporary accommodation is now being used. It has been decided to build both a residence and an office for the Political Agent on the old site. 8. In the instructions issued in 1953 to the new incumbent of the post ol Political Resident the objectives of Her Majesty's Government in Bahrain are defined as follows: — (i) to maintain the existing relationship between Her Majesty's Government and the Ruler based on treaty and usage; (ii) to permit the continued orderly development of the administration; (hi) to retain the present facilities enjoyed by Her Majesty's Forces; (iv) to ensure stable conditions for the production of oil; (v) to develop enterprises which will assist in sustaining the prosperity in the event of a substantial decline in oil revenue; (vi) to create friendly relations between the Ruler and his neighbours by the equitable solution of disputes involving territorial claims and the division of the seabed.( l8 ) II.—Internal Affairs 9. Hamad visited the United Kingdom in 1936 when he was the guest of His Majesty's Government for a fortnight, and was received by His Majesty. In 1938 he performed the pilgrimage to Mecca and visited Kashmir. In 1939 he spent a part of the summer at Simla, where he was received by the Viceroy. Salman did not leave Bahrain after his accession except for brief visits to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait until 1953 when he was invited to the United Kingdom to attend Her Majesty's Coronation. After that event he sent his sons, Isa and Khalifah, to spend a holiday in the United Kingdom. His uncle, Shaikh Muhammad, has travelled extensively and has visited the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Two of Muhammad's sons, Khalifah and Salman, were educated for a time at the American University, Beirut, and the former subsequently received police training in India and the latter judicial training in Palestine. Another son, Hamad, spent a year or more at the Stanford University in California. Khalifah is Director- General of Public Security, and Salman sits in one of the local Courts, but he and Hamad, who holds no appointment, are discontented with their allowances and on bad terms with the Ruler. The best-educated of the Ruler's brothers, Abdullah, who accompanied Hamad to the United Kingdom in 1936 and stayed on for six months at Oxford learning English, is also discontented and threatens from time to time to leave Bahrain. 10. The question of allowances for the ruling family has been a bone of contention between the Ruler and the political authorities, and a matter in which Belgrave has been able to exercise little influence. As in other Gulf States the Ruler is constantly being pestered on the subject by his relatives. In the early 'thirties when oil revenues began to accrue it was arranged that one-third of them should be set aside for the Ruler's privy purse, the allowances of other members of his family being paid out of general revenues. In 1950 when the oil royalty was increased to Rs. 10/ - per ton the Ruler still retained his one-third share but agreed to pay his family's allowances out of it and these ceased to be debitable to the general revenues. Although the oil revenues were further increased by the fifty-fifty profit-sharing agreement of 1952 the same arrangement still holds good. In the budget for the Muhammadan year 1372 ending in September 1953 the civil list was estimated at about £500,000 out of a total revenue of about £2,350,000. The figure may rise to about £800,000 when full payments under the profit-sharing agreement are received, but there is unlikely to be any further increase unless fresh sources of oil are found. Sir Roger Makins recommended in 1952 that every effort should be made to get away from the system by which some Rulers receive a fixed percentage of the oil revenues,( 19 ) but in the case of Bahrain it has been decided to make no approach to the Ruler on the subject in view of the smallness of his revenues from this source compared with those of Kuwait and Qatar.

He is now his s'™ vear and has as vet given no indication of wishing to retire. He and tne omer British State employees serve under contract with the B a h 7 l n Governmen^ a is the custom, surviving from the days of the Government of India for the Bahram Government to obtain the formal approval of Her Majesty s Government beto any British employee is finally engaged. ^ 12. There has been no sign of any agitation in Bahrain for a ^e popular form of government but anonymous pamphlets have appeared from time to demanding Belgrave's removal and there have been complaints mostly anonymous regarding the Bahrain Government Hospital and the British Medical Officer in charge of it, the local Courts, and the lack of accommodation m the schools. Some younger members of the intelligentsia are believed to be responsible for such agitation but there does not appear to be any organised party During recent years three local journals have appeared. At first a loose censorship was exercised over them by Belgrave but this ceased on the issue by the Ruler in TO 3 ot a Press Ordnance (Appendix B). This has not been enforced against persons subject to the Order in Council by a Queen's Regulation. These journals have published criticisms of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the British Overseas Airways Corporation and attacks on the local Jews but have usually been careful not to offend the Bahrain Government. It may be noted here that during the last war an Arabic newspaper sponsored by His Majesty's Government was published m Bahrain. At the beginning of 1953 a proposal to start a local Arabic newspaper, in order to counteract the influence of Egyptian and other journals, was considerea by Her Majesty's Government! 21 ) but no decision had been reached by the end of the year. Up to date there has been no evidence of any Communist activity in Bahrain. The large Persian element in Manamah have shown no overt sympathy with the Persian claim to Bahrain nor have the Shiah Baharinah(') except for one of their number who as related below (paragraph 84) appeared in the Majlis at Teheran and demanded Persian intervention. Although these Baharinah claim to be Arabs and speak Arabic there is a danger of their turning to their co -religionists in Persia if pressed too hard by the local Sunnis. 13. Serious breaches of law and order have been rare in Bahrain during the period under review. With the Sunni and Shiah communities more or less evenly balanced in numbers trouble from time to time arises between them especially during the Muharram celebrations. The last riot of this nature occurred in September 1953 when there were a number of casualties, none of them fatal. In 1932 there was serious agitation over an Inheritance Proclamation issued by the Ruler which he weakly withdrew and in the same year the divers staged a riot to obtain increased pay. This assumed serious proportions and there were some fatal casualties. In December 1947 there were anti-Jewish riots as a result of the United Nations' decision to partition Palestine. Some Jewish houses and shops were looted and there were a few casualties. 14. Before this the Jewish families in Bahrain, numbering about fifty, had been well-treated. Some have since emigrated to Palestine. The Ruler will not allow any of them to return nor will he permit any more Jews to arrive in Bahrain, but he does his best to ensure the fair treatment of those that are left, though there is a certain amount of propaganda against them by less responsible members of the intelligentsia and the local journals.

( 22 ) The name Baharinah (singular Bahrani) denotes the members of a race of Arabic-speaking Shiahs found not only in Bahrain but also in some of the other Gulf Shaikhdoms and in parts of Saudi Arabia. It is necessary to distinguish between Bahrani meaning a member of this race and Bahrain! meaning an inhabitant of Bahrain. ( 23 ) P. 207, Lorimer, Vol. 11.19 15. On the outbreak of the last war Hamad made an immediate contribution of £30,000 towards war expenditure and his successor and other notables contributed to the Fighter Fund. Defence Regulations were issued and the oil-field and refinery declared prohibited areas. In October 1940 Italian aircraft bombed the vicinity of the refinery without doing any damage. A special Defence Officer was appointed to Bahrain and troops were brought in largely for the defence of the oil company's camp and the refinery. The strength of the Royal Air Force detachment at Muharraq was increased and local levies were raised but as they did not prove satisfactory they were disbanded and replaced by Iraqi levies. Special Defence Police were enlisted locally for the protection of the oil-field. An attempt by the Political Agent to form a Defence Corps out of British personnel in the oil company was unsuccessful. In 1942 a Defence Regulation was issued to prevent British subjects leaving the oil company's employ. A number of oil wells were plugged and plans made for dealing with the remainder in the event of an emergency. The most serious problem created locally by the war was that of keeping the people fed and clothed and on occasions serious shortages threatened. The Bahrain Government took over the supply of essential foodstuffs and an elaborate system of rationing and price control was organised under the Director of Customs, requirements being obtained through the Middle East Supply Centre. A Regulation was issued under the Order-in-Council empowering the Political Resident or Political Agent to make orders regarding the rationing, price-control and the export of goods of any description and orders were made in consultation with the Bahrain Government and applied by them. The war-time Regulation was replaced by the Supplies and Services Regulation of 1947( 21 ) which confers similar powers, and rationing, price-control and export control were still being enforced to a limited extent at the end of 1953. 16. The Bahrain Government issues an annual Administration Report which gives details of the annual revenue and expenditure. Since oil revenues have accrued it has been Belgrave's policy to build up a substantial reserve as the life of the oil-field is expected to be a short one. The Bahrain Government's investments were originally made in sterling securities. In 1941 on the advice of the Political Resident they transferred them to rupee securities. When the transfer of power in India was imminent in 1947 it was suggested to them that they should transfer their investments back into sterling but they failed to take action until the new Government of India had issued regulations which restricted such transfers.( 25 ) In 1949 they applied to the Reserve Bank of India for permission to sell half of their rupee securities and subsequent investments have been made in sterling securities. They have however not yet converted their Indian securities and in 1952 they had about £900,000 invested in India and about £1,600,000 in the United Kingdom. The total revenue for the Muhammadan year 1372 ending in September 1953 was then estimated at about £2,350,000, of which two-thirds was to come from oil, and the expenditure at about £1,950,000, and a sum of £240,000 was ear-marked for investment. Of the expenditure about £725,000 was for new works. 17. The Customs Department is under a British Director. The latest Customs Ordinance was issued in 1950 and was applied to persons subject to the Order-in-Council by a King's Regulation^ 26 ) Customs duties are levied at 15 per cent, ad valorem on tobacco and alcoholic liquor and at 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, on all other goods. 18. The Ruler as a good Muslim is determined not to tolerate the drinking of alcoholic liquor by his subjects and difficulty is experienced with him from time to time on account of leakages from British Defence Service canteens, clubs, and other sources. Under his ordinance issued in 1944 (Appendix C (i)) any of his subjects found in possession of alcoholic liquor is liable to six months' imprisonment and this penalty is often enforced, but never against offenders belonging to his own family. Many of his subjects including members of his family are addicted to liquor and his attitude is to some extent an impediment to social intercourse between them and Europeans and Americans especially as he does not favour their frequenting clubs where liquor can be obtained. An Alcoholic Drinks Regulation was issued in 1951( 27 ) in respect of persons subject to the Order-in-Council which amongst other things forbids the offering of alcoholic ( 24 ) No. 1 of 1947.

Half of the members of the Committees are h noll J' n ^ Jj' ^ elected but the electoral system has broken down in Manan ah ln this p a Shiah Baharinah complained that they did not get their fair s hare of seats . 50 per cent, on the basis of their numerical strength, an d m l9 51 their member all walked out. Attempts to rectify the position angered the Sun . nis and „ 1 elected members followed suit. A caretaker Committee of six nominated Sunnis was appointed to carry on, and it was decided to abandon the electoral sys em in Manamah for the time being. The Ruler very re ' ucta ''y a f'?f tl ,g 0 |a ' h ' nomination of an equal number of Sunnis and Shiahs and m March 195j the latter took their seats. The Sunnis are much displeased at this development but have agreed to see how the system works. The meat and fish and vegetable markets m Muharraq belong to the Ruler and one of his brothers, who let them out to contractors. The rents demanded by the latter from stall-holders are often excessive and have been the subject of much complaint. Efforts have been made without success to persuade the Ruler to make over the markets to the Municipal Committees. Manamah Municipal Bye-Laws were enforced against persons subiect to the Order in Council in 1921 by a King's Regulation ( ) which provides for the enforcement of any subsequent modifications and amendments approved by the Political Resident on publication by the Political Agent. No such regulation has been issued in respect of the other municipalities where few persons subject to the Order in Council reside. 20 A census was held by the Bahrain Government in 1941 and again in 1950. On the latter occasion the population was found to be 109,650 of whom 91 179 were Bahrain subjects. The foreigners included 2,130 Europeans and Americans ( 29 ) Owing to local feeling on the subject Sunnis and Shiahs were not registered separately, the Sunnis apparently fearing that the Shiahs might be found to be in the majority as they were in 1941. 21. At the beginning of the period under review the Bahrain Police Force consisted mostly of Indians. These were gradually eliminated and after 1932 only a few Indian inspectors remained. The strength of the force in 1952 was 290. In addition 254 armed watchmen (naturs) were employed. The Police are well equipped and organised and reasonably efficient. In 1932 Belgrave himself assumed the functions of Commandant, a position which he has since jealously retained. The second-in-command is Shaikh Khalifa (paragraph 9 above) who was appointed Superintendent in 1939 and since 1953 has called himself Director- General of Public Security. After the war several British inspectors were appointed, but since 1950 there has been only one, who is in charge of traffic control. In view of the increase of work involved in passport control, the prevention of the traffic in dangerous drugs and other more or less technical matters the Bahrain Government have been pressed from time to time to employ more British Inspectors and in 1953 the Ruler agreed to this being done, but difficulty then arose over the secondment of suitable officers from the United Kingdom. A Motor Vehicles Proclamation issued by the Ruler in 1939 has been enforced against persons subject to the Order in Council by a King's Regulation^ 30 ) The Political Agent has power to appoint Special Police Officers under a King's Regulation issued in 1936.( 31 ) The Bahrain Petroleum Company have their own guards and the Bahrain Government Police do not operate in their camps and installations unless called upon to do so. 22. There are two Senior Courts of Justice each presided over by one magistrate, and these two magistrates and the Financial Adviser sit together once a week to hear appeals from the Junior Courts and important cases. There are also two Junior Courts each presided over by two magistrates. A Senior Appeal Court ( 28 ) No. 1 of 1921. ( 29 } Government of Bahrain Annual Report for 1369. ( 30 ) No. 1 of 1939. ( 31 ) No. 2 of 1936.21 iealousl) presided over by the Ruler's uncle, Abdullah, and the Financial Adviser hears appeals from the Senior Courts. All these Courts hear both criminal and civil cases. Separate Sunni and Shiah Shara Courts try cases which have to be decided in accordance with Muhammadan law. There is a Shiah Appeal Qadhi but the post of Sunni Appeal Qadhi has been vacant for some years. Commercial cases are referred to the Majlis al Tujarah, a committee of merchants presided over by the Ruler's brother, Abdullah. There are many complaints against the magistrates who are all members of the ruling family, not because they are venal but because with one exception they have no judicial training and having no codes to guide them are inconsistent in their decisions. In criminal cases, according to the Financial Adviser, the principles of the Sudan Penal Code are supposed to be followed. A new Penal Code is under preparation for the courts functioning under the Orders in Council to replace the Indian Penal Code, which is at present being followed, and it is hoped that it will be possible to persuade the Ruler to adopt the new Code for his Courts. As recommended by Sir Eric Beckett,( 32 ) who visited the Persian Gulf in 1952, attempts have been made hitherto without success to persuade him to employ permanently a British judicial or legal adviser to assist him in the reorganisation of his Courts and the drafting of legislation^ 33 ) For the latter purpose he does on occasions employ Mr. Ballantyne, a British lawyer practising in Bahrain. 23. A Land Registration Department is maintained with which all transfers of immovable property have to be registered in accordance with a decree issued by the Ruler in 1947 and enforced against persons subject to the Order in Council by a King's Regulation^ 34 ) In view of the large influx of foreigners into Bahrain and in order to protect the interests of his own subjects the Ruler has found it necessary to issue decrees placing restrictions on the requisition of immovable property by foreigners. The first of these, which was promulgated in 1937, was of a retaliatory nature and was largely directed against the Persians who had prohibited the acquisition of immovable property by foreigners in their country. This decree( 35 ) and a subsequent amending decreef 35 ) were applied to persons subject to the Order in Council by King's Regulation. In 1949 the Ruler issued a decree prohibiting absolutely the transfer of immovable property by Bahrain nationals to persons who were not Bahrain nationals except with the consent of the Bahrain Government. In 1952 a revised decree was issued which also prohibited the transfer of immovable property by foreigners to foreigners. This decree was not enforced as it stood against persons subject to the Order in Council but a Queen's Regulation^ 6 ) was made embodying its provisions. In 1944 the Ruler issued a decree regulating rents and leases which was repealed and replaced by a new decree in 1946. The latter was enforced against persons subject to the Order in Council by a King's Regulation in 1951. As this Regulation was found to contain defects it was repealed and replaced by a Queen's Regulation in 1952.( 37 ) 24. Bahrain as a commercial centre has attracted many foreign, including British, firms. A General Merchants' Association, including representatives of both local and foreign firms, was formed in 1938 and recognised by the Bahrain Government as a Chamber of Commerce in 1951. In recent years the Ruler has adopted a policy of reserving as much local business as possible for his own subjects. Indian and Pakistanis are not now permitted to settle in Bahrain in t , 0 set up buslness . though there is no interference with the many Indian and Pakistan shop-keepers who are already there, and a promise has been given to the Ruler that he will be consulted before any foreign firms are permitted to set up business (para. 5 above). It is probable that he will only agree to new foreign firms' establishing themselves if they form local companies and take Bahrainis into partnership. There is as yet no local company law which would make the registration of such companies possible but one has been drafted by the Bahrain Ooyernment and is under consideration by Her Majesty's Government who are anxious to ensure that it is issued in a form which can be made applicable without modification to persons subject to the Order in Council. Foreign firms have Ions been urging the enactment of legislation to protect patents and trade marks. A (; i2 ) Sir E. Beckett's Report. (EA 1142/6 of 1952.)

All P , ^ TcCols are fuU and bo?s often have to be refused admission for lack of accommodation. There is not a very great demand for secondary education an the Ser classes are poorly attended. Most of the boys as soon as they have acauired a smattering of English seek employment with the oil companies or n businesses in the towns. Technical education is not popular and little appears to uTdane to make it so A few boys go on from the secondary school to the A^nerican UnfvSsity Beirut either' on scholarships granted by the Bahrain Government or the Bahrain Petroleum Company, or at their parents expense. A few boys have also been sent by their parents to schools in the United Kingdom. Female education flourishes under Lady Belgrave who is Directress of Girls Education In 1952 the attendance was 1,964 including a secondary class with an attendance of II. An annual Needlework Exhibition is held. ?7 An important problem with which the Bahrain Government has to deal is the conservation of its water supplies. The date-gardens at the northern end of the main island and on some o£ the smaller islands are irrigated from natural springs and artesian wells. At the beginning of the period under review there was much haphazard sinking of wells which led to a fall in the water-table. In 933 the Ruler issued a decree forbidding the sinking of wells in certain areas. In 1941 a further prohibition was issued and in 1948 a Water Conservation Committee, which included a geologist from the Bahrain Petroleum Company, was set up to consider all applications for the drilling of new wells. A scheme has been considered from time to time for making additional water available for irrigation by pumping it up from fresh water springs which are known to exist under the sea. There is additional land which could be brought under cultivation but difficulty might be experienced in finding the manpower to till it. At the end of 1953 Mr. Crawford of the British Middle East Office submitted a report on the water resources of Bahrain and recommended that the local Government should engage a firm of consultants to examine thenU 3 ') 28. Bahrain's date gardens supply the local population with its requirements of dates for about eight months in the year. Lucerne and vegetables are also grown. The Bahrain Government have for many years had an experimental farm at Budaiya on the western coast of the main island but up to date it appears to have achieved little. The Government of India sent an Indian agricultural expert to Bahrain before the war but his report was only received after a long delay ( 38 ) P R. to F.O. 16432/3 of December 10, 1951 (EA 1471/2 of 1951). ( 39 ) P.R.toF.O. 1087/11/53 of December 22, 1953 (EA 11010/2 of 1953).23 and was found to be of little value. In 1949 Sir Herbert Stewart the agricultural expert at the British Middle East Office visited Bahrain and submitted a detailed report.( 10 ) On his recommendation the Bahrain Government have since 1950 employed a British Agricultural Officer on their farm at Budaiya. He has tried out various crops and has experimented in cattle and sheep breeding. No attempt yet appears to have been made to improve the date cultivation or the handling of the crop. 29. The material development of Bahrain has been effected very gradually. A power house was first opened in 1930. It has been extended from time to time since then but never seems quite to keep pace with the demand for current. A State Hospital was opened in 1940. In 1941 a causeway and bridge linking the main island and Muharraq were formally opened by Shaikh Hamad. In 1949 a piped water supply from Manamah and new Bahrain Government offices were completed. Since the last war many roads have been improved and many houses built both by the Bahrain Government and by private persons. The Bahrain Government have now embarked on a project for deepening the entrance channel to the Khor Qalaiyah and building a jetty and wharf at Jufair. Work on this started towards the end of 1953. It is hoped that when it is completed ocean-going steamers will be able to come alongside the wharf for the discharge of their cargoes instead of lying several miles oif Manamah or at the Sitrah anchorage and discharging into lighters as at present. 30. Little has been done as yet to establish secondary industries. In 1946 a Persian mill-owner Hussain Agar wished to erect a cloth factory in Bahrain but abandoned the scheme because of the conditions imposed by the Bahrain Government. More recently Messrs. Chas. Kendall and Partner proposed to establish a cold storage plant but dropped the project because the Ruler insisted on having too much control over it. In 1953 a proposal to form a local company for this purpose was under consideration^ 11 ) In or about 1950 a member of the ruling family constructed a small lime plant. At the end of 1953 Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Company were constructing a slipway adjoining the Muharraq causeway for the repair of launches and other small craft, and a proposal to use natural gas from the oil-field for industrial development was under consideration^ 42 ) III.—The Zubarah Dispute 31. Zubarah is a ruined and uninhabited village on the north-west coast of Qatar peninsula in which the Ruler of Bahrain claims certain rather ill-defined rights. This claim has become an obsession with the present Ruler, as it was with his father; it tends to embitter his whole outlook and has at times threatened to cause a deterioration in his relations with Her Majesty's Government. 32. A note giving the history of the case down to 1946 was forwarded to the Foreign Office by the Political Resident in 1948 with a representation to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs which had then been received from the Ruler.( 43 ) Zubarah was founded by the A1 Khalifah, the Bahrain ruling family, in 1766 and from there they captured Bahrain in 1783. Betv/een 1811 and 1842 the place became entirely deserted but it was rebuilt in the latter year by one of the Al Khalifah. By 1868 the Al Thani the present ruling family in Qatar had risen to power and in 1871 the Turks occupied the peninsula. In 1872 Shaikh Isa of Bahrain wished to establish a garrison at Zubarah but was advised by the Political Resident not to do so. In the following year the Government of India agreed that the Ruler of Bahrain had no clear or important rights on the mainland and instructed the Political Resident to advise him not to interfere there. In 1875 Isa replied to the letter received from the Political Resident on the subject saying that he would refrain from interfering in the mainland except his city Zubarah which was his property. The Political Resident wrote to him again saying that reports which he had received showed an increasing necessity for avoidance of all interference in the mainland (whether at Zubarah or any other place no exception is made).' The Government of India also instructed the Political ( 40 ) B.M.E.O. to F.O. 105/39/385 of May 7, 1949 (E 5865/1281/91 of 1949). ( 41 ) PR to F.O. 11012/27/53 of May 20, 1953 (EA 1105/4 of 1953).

Hamad protested but no reply was sent to his letter. 34. In 1944 the Political Agent Bahrain effected an agreement (Appendix D (i)) whereby the two Rulers agreed to the restoration of friendly arrangements between them as they were in the past and Shaikh Salman then raised his blockade of Qatar. In the agreement the Ruler of Qatar had undertaken that Zubarah would remain without anything being done in it which did not exist m the past, which he interpreted as meaning that no further innovation should take place there. I Salman however insisted that it meant that the new fort there should be destroyed. This reopened the dispute and early in 1945 the Ruler of Qatar was induced to remove his guards from the fort. In March 1945 the Political Agent wrote to Salman informing him that the Political Resident had never supported his claims to Zubarah. Complaints continued to pour in from him, those between 1946 and 1948 being summarised in a note forwarded by the Political Resident in the latter year ( 46 ) In March of that year Salman forwarded some rather vague details of the property and rights which he claimed (Appendix D (ii)). A copy of his letter was forwarded to the Ruler of Qatar who rejected the claims as being out of date and made regardless of changes which had taken place in the course of many years. In his representation to the Secretary of State Salman stated his case more broadly (Appendix D (hi)) and it is interesting to note that he only asked to be allowed to hold the land he claimed ' in private ownership for ever ' and that he expressed his willingness to renounce all oil rights in it in favour of the Ruler of Qatar, pointing out that he had never claimed such rights. It is thus clear that at that time he made no claim to sovereignty over the land in question. 35. The terms of the reply to be sent to this representation remained under discussion for many months and in the event no reply jwas ever sent. At the beginning of 1949 Salman agreed that if his people were allowed to settle in Zubarah the Ruler of Qatar should exercise jurisdiction over them and asked that he might be permitted to appoint a representative to argue his case with the Foreign Office in London.( 17 ) This was agreed to and he appointed Mr. Ballantyne, a lawyer who was at that time the Bahrain Petroleum Company's representative in London, ( 44 ) I.O. to F.O.

A conversation accordingly took place at the Foreign Office and an undertaking was given that His Majesty's Government would use their good offices as far as possible to bring about an agreement between the two Rulers.C 8 ) 36. In August 1949 Shaikh Abdullah of Qatar abdicated and it was hoped that his successor Ali might prove more amenable on the subject of Zubarah. An early approach was made to him but he asked that the matter should be postponed for a time. Meanwhile Salman again became restive and at the end of the year demanded that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. should cease the use of their jetty at Sitrah for traffic to and from Qatar but was persuaded to lift this embargo. In January 1950 he went to see the Political Resident and demanded that either he should be told that he had no rights in Zubarah or that His Majesty's Government should force the Ruler of Qatar to observe the 1944 agreement. Very shortly after this the Political Agent succeeded in bringing about an unwritten understanding between the two Rulers as a result of which the dispute remained dormant for nearly three years.( 4,J ) Ali of Qatar agreed that Salman's retainers might come to the Zubarah area without being subject to customs duties or any supervision provided they were ' specified ' and that they brought supplies only for their own use. They would come under Qatar jurisdiction. He would open the fort there and leave it empty. Salman should reduce the discriminatory 5 per cent, duty on goods in transit to Qatar to the 2 per cent, charged on goods in transit to other countries, should allow freedom of movement between Bahrain and Qatar, and should build nothing in the Zubarah area. Salman issued proclamations removing restrictions on travel by his subjects to Qatar and reducing the duty on goods in transit to Qatar to 2 per cent. He also forwarded to the Political Agent lists of the people he was sending over to Zubarah. He would not agree that they should come under Qatar jurisdiction and the Political Agent wrote to Ali to the effect that if any dispute arose as a result of the arrangement made it would be better that it should be referred to the political authorities for a decision. In the course of the correspondence the Political Agent gave an assurance to Ali that neither the Ruler of Bahrain nor any of his dependants would undertake any building in the Zubarah area. This was presumably based on an oral understanding reached with Salman who, the Political Agent reported, had with difficulty been persuaded to give up insisting on his right to ' properties ' in Zubarah. The negotiations nearly broke down because Ali for a time insisted on leaving two watchmen in the fort. It was eventually arranged that the fort should remain locked and that the two watchmen should live in a tent near by. 37. Although Salman quickly dropped the practice of sending to the Political Agent lists of his people who were going to Zubarah the dispute remained dormant and relations between Bahrain and Qatar were satisfactory until February 1953, when a party of Bahrain schoolboys accompanied by schoolmasters, some of whom were foreigners, went on an excursion to Zubarah and inscribed ' A1 Bahrain ' in large letters on the walls of the fort.i 30 ) About the same time the Bahrain Education Department published an annual report containing a map which showed Zubarah as included in Bahrain territory.( 5] ) This infuriated Ali who established a small police post in a tent close to the fort. Salman demanded the removal of the police post as contrary to the agreements of 1944 and 1950, but efforts to persuade Ali to restore the status quo failed. 38. Salman raised the Zubarah question in interviews with the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs when he visited the United Kingdom for Her Majesty's Coronation in June 195 3.( 52 ) He was told that the new Political Resident, who was then being appointed to the Persian Gulf, would study the whole question on his arrival there and the possibility of some form of arbitration was suggested. Salman replied that he would accept a British arbitrator. 39. Arbitration by some local Arab personality such as the Ruler of Kuwait or of Umm al Qaiwain had been suggested by the outgoing Political Resident,( 53 ) and the Ruler of Kuwait himself subsequently indicated that he would be willing to help (48) n (50) n n n F.O. to P.R.

IV.—Islands and Sea-bed (a) The Hawar Islands 41 In the negotiations for an oil concession for the additional area which began in 1936 (para. 64 below) the Ruler claimed the Hawar Islands which he off the west coast of Qatar, as part of his dominions, and m April ot that year the Financial Adviser recorded the claim in writing, stating that the peopie of the islands were and always had been under the jurisdiction ot the Ruler of Bahrain ( ) In 1938 the Ruler of Qatar wrote to the Political Agent, Bahrain, claiming the islands on geographical grounds and complaining of Bahrain aggression on them. He was asked to submit his formal claim supported by all the evidence that he could produce and told that after that the dispute would be settled by His Majesty s Government ( 58 ) He replied that the occupation of the islands by Bahrain was recent and unlawful and that they clearly belonged to Qatar on geographical grounds. His claim was communicated to the Ruler of Bahrain and the latter's counter-claim was passed on to the Ruler of Qatar. A very lengthy refutation of the Bahrain arguments was received from the latter, but he was able to adduce little if any more concrete evidence in support of his claim.( 59 ) The Political Agent, Bahrain, examined all the documents and after discussing the claims of the parties in detail gave a finding in favour of Bahrain on the basis of proof of the exercise of jurisdiction over the islands for a period of many years. This finding was supported by the Political Resident and accepted by His Majesty's Government. It was communicated to the two Rulers in July 1939.C 0 ) A letter of thanks was received from the Ruler of Bahrain but the Ruler of Qatar expressed his regret and asked for a reconsideration of the decision. He was informed by the Political Resident in writing that the decision was final and that the case could not be re-opened.C') {b) The Sea-bed between Bahrain and Qatar 42. The necessity for determining the dividing line between the interests of Bahrain and Qatar in the sea-bed of the waters separating the two States was recognised in 1940 as a result of the activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's ( 54 ) p.R. to F.O.

In May of that year the company asked for permission to operate in certain newlieit areas some of which it was considered might eventually be found to belong to iMuciiit Qatar. His Majesty's Government decided that they could not be permitted to iucatioi operate in these areas until there had been a division of the sea-bed between ml Bahrain and Qatar and expressed the opinion that it was desirable to lay down a lan y dividing line at a fairly early date. They reserved the right to decide the exact fribanl location of the line but stated that the agreement of the interested parties was avoidd desirable. In Anglo-United States talks in November 1946 it was decided that the Polity matter should be treated as an ordinary boundary question without raising the di^ general question of the continental shelf. daimd 43. Details of the dividing line were discussed during 1947 and the decision olicyto reached with the approval of His Majesty's Government was announced to the sm into two Rulers and the two oil companies concerned in December of that year in wers (Appendix E). The decision was based on a median line conforming generally to Imitted the configuration of the coast-line of the Bahrain main island, and the Qatar aredb) peninsula. The Dibal and Jaradah shoals, which were found to lie to the east thertk of this line, were assigned to Bahrain, as it was decided that that State had established sovereignty over them, and the line was bent to include the Hawar Islands which had been awarded to Bahrain in 1939 (paragraph 41 above). With regard to the two shoals it was stated that His Majesty's Government were of opinion that they should not be considered to be islands having territorial waters. This opinion was subsequently modified (paragraph 47 below). It was decided that Janan Island which lies close to the Hawar group of islands but is separated from them by a deep channel and which had not been specifically mentioned in the 1939 decision was not part of the group and that it belonged to Qatar. At .• a the conclusion it was stated that the decision was subject to revision in the event Je oil more exact geographical data being forthcoming at a later date. ar the 44. The Ruler of Qatar while asserting his claim to the Hawar Islands and jf the the Dibal and Jaradah shoals expressed his readiness to accept His Majesty's iin.( 57 ) Government's orders.( 65 ) The Ruler of Bahrain raised a number of objections, the the most important of which concerned a map produced by Petroleum Concession them. Limited in 1938 in the course of their negotiations for the additional area hat he (paragraph 64 below). In this much of the sea-bed awarded to Qatar was shown ijesty's within the area which was then the subject of negotiations. The Bahrain Petroleum ; recent Company supported the Ruler's objections and added some of their own and rounds. Petroleum Concessions Limited also raised some objections. All the objections ir-daim were carefully considered and replies sent to the Rulers and the companies in Bahraia which they were discussed and rejected, and the addressees were asked to regard 1 11 an \ the award which had been communicated to them as final.( 6tl ) Jahraift 45 Salman replied on May 23, 1949 refusing to accept the award as final ndetai: anc [ claiming the ownership of all the sea between Bahrain and Qatar.C 7 ) He rcise 0' questioned His Majesty's Government's right to make a decision without reference ing was to him. A strongly worded reply was drafted but never sent. In November 1949 jrnmeiit he wrote to the Political Agent with reference to the off-shore concession granted nkswas by the Ruler of Qatar to the Superior Oil Company claiming sovereignty over gret ani all the seas between Bahrain and Qatar and received a reply that this claim was not Political admitted by His Majesty's Government.( ,18 ) In December 1950 the Bahrain Petroleum I n ot ttf Company as a result of the activities of the Superior Oil Company, who had obtained the Qatar off-shore concession, wrote to the Political Agent objecting once more to the division of the sea-bed made in 1947. It then came to notice that no reply had been sent to Salman's letter of May 23, 1949. The points raised oreS tsof by him then and by the company in their recent letter were replied to in letters ates ^ addressed to them on May 14, 1951 and both were again informed that the 1947 . panys decision would not be altered, except that the company only were told that His Majesty's Government had found it necessary to reconsider their opinion that ( 62 ) I.O. to F.O.

In 1949 His Majesty's Government in the light ol the opinion of experts considered the desirability of making substantial alterations in the line announced( ~) in 1947 but eventually decided it was better to adhere to the origina decision. They were inclined however to revise their opinion that the Dibal and Jaradah did not carry territorial waters but this point had not been finally decided by the end of 1953. (c) The Sea-bed and Islands between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia 48. A detailed note on the islands and shoals in dispute between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia was prepared in the Residency in 195l.C) 49. In 1936 the Ruler of Bahrain placed markers on the Bainah Islands, which lie in the channel between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and in 1938 they were included in the ' additional area ' in respect of which negotiations were proceeding with Petroleum Concessions Limited! 71 ) (paragraph 64 below). In the same year the Saudis protested against one of the markers, and were informed, incorrectly, by His Majesty's Legation at Jedda that the island concerned lay within Bahrain territorial waters.( 75 ) Subsequently the Political Agent, Bahrain, suggested a division of the sea-bed which would give one of the islands to Bahrain and one to Saudi Arabia. The Saudis then raised the question of the ownership of the Fasht al Jarim and Khor Fasht shoals where the Bahrain Petroleum Company were working. It was proposed that a representative of Ibn Saud should visit the Political Agent, Bahrain, to discuss the whole question of the division of the sea-bed( 7G ) but he never arrived and nothing further was heard from the Saudis on the subject for some years. 50. In 1941 the Bahrain Petroleum Company were given permission to carry out structure drilling on the Bu Sa'afah and Ashirah shoals, on the understanding that if the Saudi Arabian Government protested the company would suspend operations and that the absence of any such objection should not be regarded as establishing Bahrain ownership of the shoals.( 77 ) The Ruler was informed of this and stated that if Ibn Saud claimed the shoals he would at once withdraw his claim. Shortly after the company closed down exploration for the duration of the war and no work was actually carried out on these shoals.( 78 ) ( 69 ) P.R. to F.O. ( 70 ) F.O. to P.R. ( 71 ) P.R. to F.O.

In 1949 Ibn Saud and the Ruler of Bahrain issued their declarations of thefora; rights over the sea-bed and the Saudi Arabian Government followed up the issue a matter oi their declaration with a request to His Majesty's Government to enter into wnretii discussions regarding the boundaries of the sea-bed between the two States. Both refusiio the Arabian American Oil Company and the Bahrain Petroleum Company started he Sup; to stake their claims over the shoals north of Bahrain. After consulting Salman 38). | His Majesty's Government explained the position about the Bahrain Petroleum tenniii Company's operations in the Bu Sa'afah shoal (and also on Arabi Island (Chapter ir succesi 3, paragraph 71)) to the Saudi Arabian Government and suggested that they should ^ith Ski ^ allowed to continue those operations without prejudice^ 79 ) The Saudis however uperiori demanded the cessation of the operations( 80 ) and Ibn Saud wrote personally to . Noref Salman on the subject. The latter sent a non-committal reply and in his turn wernmeii protested against the operations of the Arabian American Oil Company in the area. 52. His Majesty's Government had hoped that discussion of the sea-bed the Rule: boundary with the Saudis might be postponed until the dispute with them about iO sure l an d boundaries had been settled but were forced to the conclusion that this was y foundi no longer possible. The Bahrain Petroleum Company were asked to cease i the sai operations in the area and in April 1950 the Saudi Arabian Government was le bring! informed that His Majesty's Government were intending to present to them is likelyt proposals for the delimitation of the sea-bed between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain ily slight and asked to advise the Arabian American Oil Company also to suspend operations in the disputed areas, the limits of which were defined.( ') The company suspended 0 f exDei: operations accordingly. In May 1950 this company fixed plaques on all the beacons ^ marking the channel to Ras Tanurah including those on the Rennie and Bu Sa'afah nriw shoals Wlth inscri P tl ons to the effect that they were situated in Saudi territory.( 82 ) nihahn ^ U l er prolssted about the plaque on Bu Sa'afah and a protest was made bv His ^decide Ma J est y' s Embassy at Jeddah to the Saudi Arabian Government. 53. At the end of 1949 or the beginning of 1950 the Saudis placed markers on certain islands claimed lor Ivuwait and also on the two Bainah Islands which were claimed by Bahrain.( 83 ) Salman protested strongly against their action on the latter islands, and Belgrave forwarded to the Political Agent a detailed statement rain anc or Bahrain s claim.C ) This was based largely on usage but also referred to Article 13 of the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 which mentions the two l Islands islands as included in Bahrain. A protest was made to the Saudi Arabian :hey weii Government. roceediii 54 s auc ji s forwarded a note on May 11, 1950 in reply to notes dealing same}- w ith this and other territorial disputes accusing His Majesty's Government of ull acce P t&gt;lng tlle Ru l ers claims without due scrutiny, urging the statement of the n ba&amp;m claims on a real historical basis and suggesting that a joint technical committee iggested should.be appointed to examine the disputes in a practical manner.( 83 ) In August a nd 0Del His Majesty's Embassy at Jedda presented two aide-memoires to the Saudi he raw Arabian Government.( s ') In the first, the intention of removing the plaques on the reworP; Bu Sa'afah and Rennie shoals and the markers on Farsi, Arabi and the Bainah ical hp- Islands was announced and in the second it was proposed that each Government nit he should prepare a memorandum of claims setting out the detailed evidence in which ;tforso i the claims were based, and that they should be exchanged two months before a date to be appointed for discussions, which it was proposed should take place in ion to cair Bahrain. A further communication relating to the division of the sea-bed between [( j e rstaiidi Bahrain and Saudi Arabia was promised. The Royal Navy removed all the plaques u l(j s# and markers concerned and strong protests were received from the Saudis. His re ga# Majesty's Government undertook to refrain from erecting any such markers rmeiorf themselves on the understanding that similar restraint would be exercised by the ^clai! Saudi Arabian Government. In November a note was received from the Saudis • ^ {jje m protesting against the removal of the markers and agreeing to a meeting to be held first at Dammam and then if necessary at Bahrain.

In October His Majesty's Embassy informed the Saudi Arabian Government o 'Hi*? Maiestv's Government's acceptance oi the proposal subject to a number o. conditions one o °which related to Farsi Island (chapter 3, paragraph 69) and another to territorial waters.D In acknowledging this note the Saudi Arabian Government reneated their affirmation and agreed that the erection of the lights would not have anv effect on the determination of sovereignty over the area m the future. His Maiestv's Embassy replied that they presumed that this agreement covered their proposal that the structures on which the lights were placed would not at any time be given territorial waters of their own irrespective of any decision that might be reached in the future regarding the applicability of territorial waters to artificia islands.

In December 1925 the Ruler granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate a concession( 102 ) which conferred on them in the first place an exploration licence entitling them to explore the whole of his territories for oil for a period of two years. (This concession with its subsequent indentures and supplementary agreement was printed by the India Office in 1934.)( lui ) In 1927 the licence was renewed for one year. In 1928 it came to notice that the Syndicate were proposing to transfer the concession to an American group. To prevent this it was proposed to insert a British control clause in the concession before it was renewed again. This led to much correspondence with the Syndicate and intervention by the United States Government. The Syndicate explained that it was only after they had failed to dispose of the concession to a British company that they had turned to the Americans.( 104 ) After much discussion and in spite of objections from the Government of India His Majesty's Government informed the Eastern and General Syndicate that they were willing in principle to consent to the participation of American interests in the Bahrain concession provided certain conditions were observed.( 10 ') The following conditions were subsequently prescribed: {a) that the company formed to take over the concession should be and remain a British company registered in Canada and that it should maintain a registered office in the United Kingdom in charge of a British subject who should be the recognised channel of communication between the company of His Majesty's Government, {b) that one of its five directors should be British and the nominee of His Majesty's Government, (c) that the company should maintain in Bahrain a Chief Local Representative whose appointment should be approved by His Majesty's Government and who should be the sole representative of the company empowered to deal direct with the local authorities, and {d) that as many of the employees of the company in Bahrain as was consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking should be British or Bahrain subjects.( 106 ) On representations made by the American interests slight modifications were made later in conditions {b) and (c). ( 107 ) The concession was then assigned to the Bahrain( 108 ) Petroleum Company an associate of the Standard Oil Company of California, and an agreement( 109 ) was executed with the Ruler in June 1930 whereby the exploration licence under it was extended to December 2, 1930, and its assignment was approved.( 110 ) His Majesty's Government's conditions were attached to this agreement as a schedule. 60.

Work on the refinery was started in 1935 and it was opened at the end of 1937. Oil was brought to it from Saudi Arabia first by small tankers to a jetty at Zallaq and subsequently by submarine nine-lines. In 1953 about five-sixths of the oil refined in it was the produce of Saudi Arabia. During the last war a plant was erected for the production of aviation spirit, but its use has been discontinued since the war. 63. In 1936 the Texas Corporation obtained a one-half interest in the Bahrain Petroleum Company and a company called the California Texas Oil Company Limited (Caltex) was formed for the marketing of its oiU ) In 1953 the position was as follows. The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited was a company incorporated under the Federal Law of Canada with share capital owned 50 per cent by the Standard Oil Company of California and 50 per cent, by the Texas Company Both these companies were ' Public ' companies incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in the United States of America. The California Texas Oil Company Limited was incorporated in the Bahamas and was owned by the same two companies. It had sold its marketing interests and was merely acting as a service company in New York for the various companies with which it was associated. Caltex (U.K.) Ltd., a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and owned by the same two American companies, was concerned with the processing and marketing of all the oil produced in Bahrain except that sold locally. The United Overseas Petroleum Company Ltd. a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, was the service company in London of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and Caltex (U.K.) Ltd. 64. In 1936 Petroleum Concessions Limited a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company were permitted by His Majesty's Government to approach the Ruler for a concession over the portions of his territory which had not been allotted to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, and which came to be known at the ' additional The latter Company also decided to negotiate for such a concession. A area. , competition ensued which lasted for some years. The Ruler was for a long time anxious to divide the area between the two companies, but as a result of a threat ( 112 ) I.O. to F.O.

At the beginning of 1939 he enquired whether His Majesty's Government had any objection to this course. He was told that there was no objection but it was at the same time suggested that he should award a concession for the Hawar Islands (paragraph 41 above) to Petroleum Concessions Limited.( 117 ) He still feared with some reason the effect that compliance with this suggestion would have on the Bahrain Petroleum Company and in May announced his decision to grant a concession for the whole of the additional area to that Company. The agreement which is described as a Deed of Further Modification! 11 s ) of the Lease of December 29, 1934, was signed on June 19, 1940. It was for a period of 55 years from its date of signature and covered ' all lands, islands, shoals, reefs, waters and submerged lands over which the Ruler had or might in future obtain dominion.' As a result when the Ruler made his declaration of rights over the sea-bed in June 1949 no question arose of granting a separate concession for the oil rights thereby acquired by the Ruler and no dispute ensued between him and the company such as that which occurred in some of the other Shaikhdoms. The deed provided for the same rate of royalty as the original Lease but Article VIII of the Lease was revised so as greatly to increase the minimum annual royalty payable under it for a period of 15 years from the date of the deed. The provisions of the Lease relating to protection and force majeure were also modified. There was an obligation to drill within two and a half years from the date of the deed if a favourable area had been found. The company started exploration in the additional area before the deed was signed and though this work was suspended for a few years during the last war they have covered all or most of the area and the only part of it they regard as showing promise of oil is in the vicinity of the Bu Sa'afah shoal about 50 miles north of Bahrain. They were permitted to carry out structure drilling here in 1941( 119 ) but were unable to avail themselves of the opportunity owing to the suspension of exploration work on account of the war. They under took some operations in the area at the end of 1949 and the beginning of 1950 but abandoned them at the request of His Majesty's Government pending the determination of the sea-bed boundary between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia (paragraph 52 above). 65. A Political Agreement! 120 ) between His Majesty's Government and the company was signed on June 29, 1940, and the Ruler's cognisance of it obtained by an exchange of letters.( 121 ) Amongst other things it incorporated the conditions attached to the 1930 indenture (paragraph 59 above) and embodied in the Mining Lease. With regard to the appointment of a Chief Local Representative it was provided that he should always be British. In spite of this provision it was found convenient during the last war that the local American Manager of the company should hold the appointment^ 22 ) and this practice has been followed since, although in 1949 the Ruler asked in writing for the appointment of a British Chief Local Representative.! 123 ) On August 2, 1940, the company signed a memorandum^ 24 ) agreeing that in the event of any inconsistency the Political Agreement should take precedence over their agreements with the Ruler and that if they failed to observe its terms the Ruler would be entitled to terminate his agreements with them. 66. In 1944 a dispute arose between the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The latter company under an informal arrangement were supplying fuel for both the Royal Air Force and British Overseas Airways Corporation aircraft at Bahrain and wished to erect storage tanks. The Bahrain Petroleum Company claimed that under their Deed of Further Modification (paragraph 64 above) they had the sole right to erect storage tanks for oil products at Bahrain.( 125 ) Much correspondence and discussion ensued and opinions about the legal position differed. In the event the Bahrain Petroleum Company erected tanks on behalf of the Royal Air Force on Muharraq Island at a distance from the airfield. The tanks became the property of the Royal Air ( 117 ) I.O. to F.O. P.Z. 303/39 of January 14, 1939 (E 399/196/91 of 1939). ( 118 ) No. 2 {b) I, O.A.C. ( 119 ) I.O. to F.O.

The Kuler wilt not permit them to visit the towns. , 68. The royalty payable under the 1934 Mining Lease was subject to revision after 15 years' payment and the matter was taken up by the Ruler early in 1949 Much haggling ensued in which the political authorities refused narticipate ( 128 ) Eventually the Ruler insisted that the rate should be raised to Rs.10/ - and the company after three or four months of further argument gave way and agreed to pay the rate proposed with effect from January U •: „ , matter was settled by correspondence and there was no formal modification of the 1934Lease. ^ . 69 In 1951 in view of the trouble between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the conclusion of the fifty-fifty profit-sharing agreement between the Saudi Arabian Government and the Arabian American Oil Company and negotiations for a similar agreement which were in progress at Kuwait, the company decided to offer further payments to the Shaikh. They originally proposed to offer a fee on oil imported from Saudi Arabia, a matter which had previously been raised by the Ruler but not pressed, and a royalty on the natural gas used in refining imported oil,( i;50 ) but subsequently changed their minds and on June 28 wrote to him referring to the large revenues other Middle East Governments were receiving from oil and the fact that he received no income from imported oil and stating their intention of voluntarily paying him an additional Rs. 500,000 a month with effect from June 1, 195U 131 ) The Ruler replied briefly thanking them. On July 21 they wrote him another letter saying that the new payments would continue until a ' comprehensive overall plan ' was determined upon and assuring him that under any such plan he would not receive less than he was receiving on the basis of their letter of June L( 132 ) 70. At the beginning of 1952 the company decided that in view of the negotiations for fifty-fifty profit-sharing agreements which had been completed or were in progress in neighbouring countries, they must enter into some similar arrangement with the Ruler. Negotiations went on throughout the year, delay being caused by the Ruler's insistence to begin with on payments which would give him an income for oil comparable to that received by the Ruler of Qatar, and by haggling between the Ruler and the company over the payment to be made on imported oil. A supplemental Agreement i;33 ) was eventually signed on December 8. Its main provisions were (a) the payment of a fee of 2id. per barrel on all foreign ( 126 ) M.C.A. to F.O.

The agreement was accompanied by three letters( 134 ) from the company's representative. The first of these describes how the price of crude oil will be fixed for computing the company's income. The second records the cessation of the voluntary payment of Rs. 500,000/- a month and deals with the adjustment of payments made during 1952 against payments due under the new agreement, and the third promises to review the situation should other States bordering the Persian Gulf subsequently receive substantially better terms. 71. The Supplemental Agreement contains no profit sharing clause, but this was provided for by an Income Tax Decree which the Ruler signed on the same date. Under this the company have to pay to the State 50 per cent, of their income after deducting from this share of it all royalties, rentals and other payments due under their lease and its subsequent modifications. The Decree was applied to persons subject to the Order in Council by a Queen's Regulation^ 35 ) issued on December 15 and the company then wrote to the Ruler a letter of submission to the tax and also letters( 136 ) agreeing to the settlement by arbitration of any dispute arising about the amount of tax payable under the Decree, and undertaking that in the computation of its income no deduction would be made on account of any fine which might be imposed on it as a result of the investigation into alleged oil cartels which the United States Government was then conducting. Her Majesty's Government's formal approval of the Supplemental Agreement was conveyed to the Ruler in February 1953.( 1 ■') 72. It will be noted that under the Supplemental Agreement the company have undertaken to produce oil from the Bahrain field up to the maximum for five years only. This is because its life is expected to be short and the company are of opinion that it will be desirable to taper off production after five years in order to conserve its resources for as long as possible.! 138 ) They have drilled several deep wells in the field but have found no further reserves. They have explored all the additional area and the only region which gives much promise of oil may fall to the Saudis when the sea-bed boundary is determined (paragraph 58 above). The Ruler is aware of the situation but bitterly resents the fact that his revenue from oil is so much less than that of Qatar and unreasonably blames the company for not producing more. As a result, his personal relations with the company's representatives have deteriorated, and at the end of 1953 he informed them that he would like them either to dig wells for oil in the sea-bed area of the concession or to give the area up so that a concession for it could be sold to another company.( 139 ) As a result they were considering the possibility of drilling at Fasht al Adham between Bahrain and Qatar where there is a small structure, but the presence of oil is quite uncertain. 73. Before the evacuation of Abadan in 1951 the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company used to supply oil products to the Gulf Shaikhdoms other than Bahrain and Kuwait. When this ceased some supplies of Persian oil continued to arrive and in order to stop this it became necessary to find an alternative source of supply. The Bahrain Petroleum Company very reluctantly undertook the responsibility.! 140 ) Their products have to be fetched from Sitrah but they maintain agents at Dohah, Dubai and Muscat. 74. The relations of the company with the local political authorities and with the Bahrain Government have always been conducted strictly in accordance with their Political Agreement. They have assisted the Bahrain Government, especially in the field of education, by the provision of teachers, schools and scholarships for the American University, Beirut (paragraph 26 above), but have always been ( 134 ) No. 4 (fl)-(c) I, O.A.C.

VI.—Relations with other States (a) The Gulf States 77 The Ruler is on good terms with all the Gulf States except Qatar. He has exchanged visits with the present Ruler of Kuwait and with his predecessor, and the Rulers of the Trucial States usually stay with him when they visit Bahrain His relations with Qatar are conditioned by the position at the time regarding Zubarah (Section III above) but apart from this he has a poor opinion of Shaikh All ana greatly resents his superior wealth. (b) Saudi Arabia 78. In 1928 the compiler of the Historical Summary of Events 1907-1928 wrote • ' There is no evidence at the moment of a more positive interest in Bahrain on the part of Ibn Saud: but there is little question that he and the Wahabi movement and not Persia are the real danger, that as matters stand he is our natural successor if we abandon our present position in Bahrain (and) that his power is appreciated and feared by the Shaikhs'! 142 ) This is still broadly true though up to the end of 1953 the Saudis had shown no signs of any aggressive designs on Bahrain and the only matters then at issue with them were the division of the sea-bed between the two States and the ownership of the Bainah Islands (Section IV (c) above). Personal relations between the Rulers of Bahrain and Ibn Saud and his successor have been cordial. Salman undoubtedly reveres and fears the Saudi ruling family and is anxious not to offend them but at the same time is unlikely to concede to them anything which he regards as his by right especially if his attitude has Her Majesty's Government's support. Ibn Saud visited Bahrain in 1930 and 1939 and Rulers of Bahrain visited him from time to time. 79. One Abdul Aziz al Qusaibi was until shortly before his death in 1953 the unofficial Saudi Trade Agent in Bahrain and in the early part of the period under review he and his brothers controlled most of the trade between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and committed a number of arbitrary acts. The ( 141 ) P.R. to F.O. Despatch 48 of June 15, 1949 (E 7969/10111 /91 of 1949).

In 1920, Ibn Saud agreed that his subjects at Bahrain should be under British protection^ 1 JJ ) In 1930 he wrote a very rude letter to Shaikh Hamad complaining of the latter's ill-treatment of his subjects. In 1949, however, the Amir of Hasa asked Salman to interfere in the administration of the estate of a deceased Saudi merchant which was being dealt with in the Court of the Political Agent and when as a result of a representation made by Salman on this occasion jurisdiction over Saudi Arabian subjects was transferred to him (paragraph 109 below), Ibn Saud raised no objection. 81. In 1935 His Majesty's Government, acting on behalf of the Ruler, reached an agreement with the Saudi Arabian Government on the subject of the transit dues payable on goods transhipped at Bahrain for export to Saudi Arabia, a matter which had been in dispute between the two countries for some years. The agreement was recorded in an exchange of letters between His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires and the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs.( 144 ) Duty was to continue to be levied at 2 per cent, on goods landed at Bahrain for re-export to Saudi Arabia, but was to be at the rate of 1J per cent, only on goods transhipped without being landed. In a separate letter His Majesty's Charge d'Alfaires gave an assurance that no duty would be levied on goods carried by ships calling at Bahrain en route to or from Saudi Arabia but not transhipped or landed there. arrels an ic) Persia rts ^ ^ 82. The history of the Persian claim to Bahrain from 1907 to 1928 is given in detail in the Historical Summary of Events for that period.( 145 ) It is given even more fully from the earliest times until 1946 in a Foreign Office ' Memorandum on Bahrain ' which was issued in 1947.( l u ') This reproduces amongst other things the detailed reply sent by His Majesty's Government to the Persian Government's note of August 2, 1928, which is referred to in Historical Summary of Events.( 147 ) This and subsequent correspondence about the Persian claim was forwarded to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations for circulation amongst its members, but the issue was never brought formally by the Persians before the Council in the Hefe Assembly. In 1934 when they were expected to do this the Law Officers of the issor, an Crown were asked to examine the case and gave it as their opinion that Persia lain. H had no right either of sovereignty or of suzerainty in or over Bahrain.( 148 ) In 1930 ^Zubaflt the Persians protested against the assignment of the Bahrain oil concession to Mi as American interests (paragraph 59 above), in 1932 against the issue of British Indian postage stamps surcharged Bahrain (paragraph 134 below), in 1936 against the agreement with the Saudi Arabian Government over Bahrain transit dues (paragraph 81 above) and in 1937 against the Bahrain Government's Nationality and Passport Laws (paragraphs 149 and 150 below) and against a statement made 1907^ in the House of Commons by the Under Secretary of State for India about the in Bah* status of Bahrain. In 1933 they began the practice which they still follow of [he Wap refusing to recognise passports containing British endorsements or visas for tiheis 0 Bahrain. In 1934 in the course of treaty negotiations His Majesty's Minister at atlusp 0 ^ Tehran communicated to the Persian Government copies of certain treaties and ethoi# 1 agreements between His Majesty's Government and certain of the Gulf Rulers, 'design The Persian Foreign Minister in acknowledging them said that the Persian vision 1 Government did not regard those which relate to places like Bahrain as being ^Sectio 11 official or valid. His Majesty's Minister once more emphasised that in view of 5 aU (l aiid [ His Majesty's Government the Persian claim to Bahrain was entirely inadmissible. rs the In the same year publicity was given in British and foreign newspapers to the • UIl likel! 1 Bahrain Petroleum Company's activities.

In April a Bill was tabled in the Majlis calling upon the Persian Government to take immediate steps to establish its authority over Bahrain.! ) Shortlv afterwards the Persian Foreign Minister was warned that His Majesty s Government would regard any attempt by the Persian Government to reopen this Question as a gratuitous attack and that they had not the slightest intention ot modifying their attitude.( 157 ) About the same time the Persian Government notified the International Telecommunications Union at Berne that as Bahrain was an integral part of Persia they did not recognise the concession granted by the Ruler to Cable and Wireless Limited( ir,s ) (paragraph 139 below). Later in the year unsigned notes were received from the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs protesting against alleged reference to Bahrain as a British possession by a United Kingdom delegate at an international wheat conference and the admission into Bahrain of refugees from Pakistan without regard to Persian immigration regulations. Both these protests were embodied in a further note( 159 ) to which a reply was sent that His Majesty's Government did not recognise any Persian claim over Bahrain. This elicited another statement of the Persian claim and refusal to recognise His Majesty's Government's treaties with Bahrain. The policy agreed to at this time and communicated to the United States Government, who /i49\ Teheran to F.O. Despatch 87 of March 18, 1947 (E 2655/2655/34 of 1947).

They supported the conclusions reached by their predecessors in 1934 (paragraph 82 above) and did not think that the International Court would find in favour of the Persian claims but were unwilling to say that there was no appreciable risk in a reference to that Court.( 1G1 ) In 1950 the policy described above was modified to some extent and it was decided that as soon as it became known that the Persian Government were to raise their claim with the United Nations, a formal note should be sent to them, and copied to the President and members of the Security Council proposing that the question should be submitted to the International Court for decision.( 1{ ' 2 ) The United States Government promised their general support to this line of action.( U13 ) 85. The situation in 1949 was quieter. In April the Persian Government protested because in an instruction issued by the Italian Government to the Banca dTtalia Bahrain was included in the sterling area.( 184 ) Later some unfounded rumours that a federation of Gulf States was contemplated led to enquiries from the Persian Government. In the latter half of the year both Persia and Bahrain were invited to attend an Islamic Economic Conference at Karachi.( l65 ) When the Persians heard of this they declined to attend the conference unless the invitation to Bahrain were withdrawn. The Pakistan Government asked His Majesty's Government to arrange this but as it was found that the Ruler of Bahrain had made up his mind to decline the invitation in any case no action had to be taken. At the end of the year Tashkent radio broadcast reports that His Majesty's Government were planning to remove all Persians from Bahrain. The Persian Foreign Minister was informed by His Majesty's Minister at Teheran that these reports were complete nonsense.( 166 ) 86. In 1948 the Persian Government protested to the Bureau of International Telecommunications Union about telegraphic traffic originating in Bahrain.( ]67 ) A rejoinder was issued through the same channel. In 1949 the Persian postal administration asked the International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union to circularise all members of the Union to the effect that as Bahrain belonged to Persia, all postal packets from Bahrain arriving in Persia with overprinted British postage stamps would be treated as unpaid. The International Bureau were induced to publish His Majesty's Government's rejoinder simultaneously with the communication received from the Persian Governments 1&lt;,s ) 87. Throughout 1950 and 1951 the Persians seized every opportunity to advertise their claim. In 1950 in the World Health Conference at Istanbul they announced that they would withdraw their delegation if Bahrain were represented. At the International Food Conference in Karachi the Persian Delegation threatened to walk out if a Bahrain delegate attended. In Egypt the Persian Ambassador protested against the attendance of the Bahrain Director of Education at an Educational Conference convened by the Arab League. In Paris the Persian Embassy complained to the Secretariat of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation because in their foreign trade Statistical Bulletin Bahrain was included as a British ' Dependent Overseas Territory.' At the end of 1950 a bill was proposed in the Persian Majlis requiring the Government to perfect immediately the administrative organisation of Bahrain( 169 ) but it appears not to have been pursued owing to pre-occupation with the oil dispute; the matter was ( 160 ) Washington to F.O.

The Dresent R u ier and his father before him have never nersecuted the Persians, which may have been in part due to the fact that until 1953 thev were under British jurisdiction, but have been alarmed at their large numbers and have enacted legislation to prevent them acquiring property unless they became Bahrain subjects (paragraph 23 above) and to limit further immigration In 95 the Ruler refused to allow any more Persians to become Bahrain subjects. In 195 imt when the trouble at Abadan was starting five Persian naval cadets arrived at Bahrain for training in one of His Majesty's ships. The Ruler protested strongly and the cadets were at once removed from Bahrain. 90 There is continuous trade across the Gulf between Bahrain and Persia, most of it illicit so far as the latter country is concerned. Bahrain is almost entirely dependent on Persia at present for the supply of meat, which is imported on the hoof and has in the past been allowed a quota of sugar above her normal requirements to give in exchange for this and other imports. Bahrain vessels are sometimes interfered with by the Persian authorities while engaged in trade on the Persian coast and two motor dhows were seized by them at the end of 1952. Usually the Persian officials are bribed to connive at the continual smuggling which goes on. r 17tr » U K Del to the U.N. to F.O. 16033/6/51 P of July 26, 1951 (EA 1081/46 of 1951).

Iraq 'does not recognise any protection control or supervision on the part of any foreign power ' over Bahrain! m ') but in practice this attitude has given rise to no difficulty. There are no matters in dispute between Bahrain and Iraq and relations between the two countries are friendly. In 1949 the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote to His Majesty's Embassy in Bagdad asking for an agreement to the establishment of a Consulate in Kuwait which would embrace Bahrain and other Shaikhdoms in its district.( J8u ) Later in the year they asked for agreement to the opening of a separate Consulate at Bahrain.( lsJ ) Shortly before this an Iraqi ex-Cabinet Minister had written to Ahmad Fakhroo, a Bahrain merchant, asking him if he would accept the post of honorary Iraqi Consul. Ahmad Fakhroo informed the writer orally that he could not send him a reply until the matter had been taken up officially with His Majesty's Embassy at Bagdad. No reply was sent to the Iraqi note about the opening of a Consulate at Bahrain and nothing further was heard from them on the subject. 92. In 1951 the Iraqi Prime Minister visited Bahrain and in the following year Salman received a visit from the Regent accompanied by the Prime Minister when Iraqi decorations were showered on members of the ruling family and Bahrain Government employees. When the Persians made a protest about this visit they also referred to the intention of the Iraqi Government to appoint a Consul at Bahrain (paragraph 88 above). The Iraqis in their reply disclaimed any such intention. In 1953 the Ruler despatched a party which included his son Isa to Bagdad to attend King Faisal's coronation. {e) India 93. Soon after the transfer of power the Government of India raised the question of the appointment of a Consul at Bahrain. The objections to this were pointed out to them and they agreed in principle to accept the appointment of a Trade Agent. The matter was referred to the Ruler who at first strongly objected on the ground that a number of other countries would demand similar representation but eventually gave way.( 182 ) In June 1950 the detailed terms of the proposed appointment were communicated to him in writing. He was informed amongst other things that the Trade Agent would not have direct access to him and that except in certain routine matters, which were defined, would correspond with the Bahrain Government through the Political Agent, that His Majesty's Government would support him if action ever became necessary against the Trade Agent on account of improper activities, and that they would continue to be responsible for his relations with India.! 18 ') The Ruler replied agreeing to the appointment and the conditions attached to it, and stating that he would object to the question of Indians entering Bahrain being discussed with the Trade Agent. The Government of India were then informed of the conditions on which the appointment was approved and also- that the Trade Agent in addition to his commercial activities would be empowered to perform normal consular functions.! 184 ) They replied that they felt thai it might not be possible to establish a representative at Bahrain in the immediate future but that they would be grateful if the Secretary of the Indian Legation at Baghdad could continue to be permitted to pay occasional visits to the area( 185 ) (paragraph 94 below). Nothing further has been heard about the appointment of a Trade Agent. 94. In February 1950 the Government of India requested that pending final arrangements for the appointment of an Indian representative at Bahrain the Secretary of the Indian Legation at Baghdad should be enabled to pay periodic visits there. His Majesty's Government agreed with this proposal ' as an informal and interim measure and on the understanding that the visiting Secretary should have no direct access to the Ruler or his authorities, but would make all representations, even on routine matters, through the Political Agent.'! 186 ) His Majesty's Government agreed that this arrangement could continue, after they had been C 79 ) Bagdad to F.O. 1383/98/51 of June 15, 1951 !GA 60/23 of 1951).

They called on the Ruler who welcomed them cordially and gave them presents. At the beginning of 1951 two frigates of the Indian Navy visited Bahrain and made a very good impression. 95. Most of the pearls from Bahrain and elsewhere in the Gulf are sent to Bombay for boring and polishing. In 1947 the Government ot India imposed a ban on the import of pearls which caused much alarm in Bahrain. Representations were made and the ban was lifted.{' ') In 1953 the Government of India imposed a 20% import duty on pearls. Representations were made by Salman and some of the Trucial States Rulers and the matter was taken up informally with the Government of India.( 191 ) In 1950 with the consent of the Ruler a fisheries expert from Madras visited Bahrain and took away with him some live pearl oysters for experimental purposes. 96. The Bahrain census of 1950 showed that there were 3,043 nationals of the Indian sub-continent living there as against 1,424 in 1941. Some of these were employed by the oil company but the majority were trading in Manamah. In 1949 before these figures were known the Ruler had become alarmed at the rapid growth of the Indian and Pakistani population of Manamah and was anxious that his own subjects should not be deprived of their local trade. A system was already in force whereby Indians and Pakistanis before they could be granted visas for Bahrain had to obtain ' No Objection Certificates ' from the Political Agent. This system is not covered by any understanding with the present Governments of India and Pakistan but has never been objected to by them. At the Ruler's request it was agreed that in future a reference should be made to his Government before any certificate was granted. This led to some agitation in the Indian press but no representation was received from the Government of India. Indians and Pakistanis are in fact allowed to visit Bahrain freely provided they have no intention of setting up business there. The Indians resident in Bahrain include several merchants of high standing and generally speaking give no trouble. if) Pakistan 97. In November 1947 the Pakistan Government stated that they did not wish for separate consular representation in the Persian Gulf, but that they were anxious that the post of Indian Assistant to the Political Agent at Bahrain, which they assumed would always be held by a Pakistani, should be continued. They asked that if there was at any time any question of its abandonment a prior reference would be made to them.( 192 ) The post, the name of which had been changed in the meanwhile to Judicial Assistant, was abolished in 1953, but in view of the time which had elapsed and developments which had taken place in the meanwhile no reference was made to the Pakistan Government. 98. In May 1949 the Secretary to the Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs while on a visit to London asked for the appointment of a Pakistan Vice-Consul at Bahrain.( ) It was suggested to him that a Trade Agent should be appointed and subsequently the Pakistan Government agreed reluctantly to have a trade representative at Bahrain to begin with.'T 91 ) The question of this appointment ( 187 ) C.R.O. to F.O.

The Pakistan Government did not, however, pursue the matter, and in September 1951 their Foreign Minister when passing through Bahrain informed a member of the Agency staff that the Pakistan Government wished to have a representative in Bahrain but that they had restrained themselves from appointing one out of deference for Persian feeling.C') This was confirmed by the Secretary of the Pakistan Department of External Affairs and Commonwealth Relations in a conversation at the Foreign Office at the beginning of 1953, which was concerned primarily with Pakistan representation at Kuwait.( 196 ) In May 1953 with the prior approval of Her Majesty's Government the Pakistan Minister in Bagdad visited Bahrain and stated that he proposed to arrange for regular visits there by a Pakistan Consular Officer to facilitate the grant and renewal of Pakistan passports.( 197 ) Subsequently the Pakistan Government stated that their Vice-Consul at Basra would be paying periodic visits to Bahrain (and Kuwait). Her Majesty's Government raised no objection and suggested that the Political Resident should be informed of such visits in advance to enable him to make the necessary arrangements.( 198 ) The proposal was communicated to and approved by the Ruler. A visit was paid accordingly by the Pakistan Vice-Consul at Basra in December 1953. 99. In November 1947 a Pakistan warship visited Bahrain. The Ruler was informed of the proposed visit but not consulted and it was agreed that this procedure should be followed in future visits by Commonwealth warships.( 19!) ) In May 1951 the Collector of Customs at Karachi visited Bahrain to discuss the possibility of taking concerted action to prevent the smuggling of gold from Bahrain into Pakistan. He was satisfied that there was little that could be done at Bahrain and that the Pakistan Government must make all the necessary arrangements to stop the traffic at their end. In 1953 the Governor-General of Pakistan spent a night at Bahrain as guest of the Political Resident on his way to Saudi Arabia. The Ruler was annoyed that no direct communication had been made to him by the Pakistan Government about the visit.( 200 ) 100. There are a substantial number of Pakistanis resident in Manamah, mostly petty shopkeepers, and amongst the oil company's employees (paragraph 96 above). They are well-behaved. The Ruler and his people have sympathies with Pakistan as a Muslim country but do not respect her to the same extent as India. They have long-standing trade and other connections with India and few with Pakistan, and since the refusal of the Pakistan Government in 1949 to devalue their rupee at the same time as the Indian rupee and sterling (chapter 1, paragraph 36) legitimate trade between Bahrain and Pakistan has practically ceased. (g) The Uniled States of A merica 101. In 1941 after obtaining the Ruler's concurrence His Majesty's Government agreed to the appointment of a United States Naval Observer at Bahrain on the understanding that his status would be similar to that of United States Naval Observers in British territory and that his official dealings with the Bahrain Government would be conducted through the Political Agent.( 20] ) He only remained for a few months in Bahrain and was then transferred to Basra. In 1943 the United States Government pressed for the appointment of a Consul at Bahrain. With great difficulty they were eventually persuaded to be content with visits to Bahrain by their Consul at Dhahran.f 32 ) About this time the refinery at Sitrah was being extended and a considerable number of Americans of a rough type were employed there. The United States authorities were much concerned about the trial of offences committed by them and were assured that any serious case involving an American could be tried in the Political Agent's Court before a jury consisting of a majority of Americans or with the aid of three or four American assessors( 203 ) In 1944 the United States Government decided to appoint a Consul at Dhahran( 204 ) ( 195 ) P.R. to P.O. 1013/16 of October 4, 1951 (EA 1013/20 of 1951).

(In 1945 this arrangement was extended to include Muscat, Qatar and the Trucial Coast.) Salman expressed much alarm when he was intormed ol the arrangement. He stated that he did not wish British influence to be shared with anyone and that in no circumstances would he agree to Persian or Saudi Arabian representation in Bahrain.^ 05 ) 102. In 1947 the United States Navy began to take an interest in the Persian Gulf. A heavy cruiser visited Bahrain, Admiral Conolly and another American Admiral arriving there at the same time by air. After the anti-Jewish riots in December 1947, when action was threatened against the Bahrain Petroleum Company if they did not get rid of a few Jews whom they employed, a United States Navy tanker was for some time stationed at Sitrah. At this time two United States Naval Officers resided with the oil company, one a general Liaison Officer and the other a technical officer concerned with oil matters. In 1948 a United States aircraft-carrier visited Bahrain and owing to the feeling against the United States over the Palestine question most of the local merchants refused to attend a party to which they were invited on board. In 1949 a Captain was appointed Commander of a United States Middle East Force consisting of one ship which is relieved every four months. It has its headquarters in the Gulf and by arrangement with the Royal Navy shares the facilities and amenities at Jufair, which has in effect become its base. In 1951 the Captain was replaced by a Rear-Admiral. '03. In 1951 a United States Naval Control Office was established at Jufair. I he Ruler was consulted and informed that the number of personnel concerned was 10. He agreed but subsequently called attention to the fact that a substantial number oi American Naval Officers and men were living in Manamah and enquired whether there was any limit to the number of American naval personnel who were to be stationed there. Although at that time the number of Naval Control Office personnel which had been intimated to him had not been exceeded some other American naval personnel were residing in Manamah. J he position was explained to him in detail in March 1952( ) since when nothing further has been heard from nim on the subject. In December 1952 the total number of American naval personnel residing in Bahrain was reported by the United States authorities to be 24. Early in 195- tne United States Commander Middle East Forces intimated that he was thinking of applying tor a lease ol a portion of the Naval Base at Jufair with a view to constructing residential and office accommodation and refrigerated storage In spite of local objections both the Admiralty and the Foreign Office were inclined to agree to this proposal but the latter wished to obtain an assurance from the Amencans that they would not increase the number of their naval D^rsonnel in Bahrain without prior consultation with Her Majesty's Government In March h'tI f . Aniencans abandoned, at any rate for the time being their wish to bm d at Jufair as accommodation had become easier to obtain in Manamah and a local commercial organisation was expected to begin the construction of refrigeration facilities in the near future.(=»') In October 1953 an American Naval Captain was appointed to reside permanently on shore at Bahrain. 104.

R (EA -3, appears1 45 to have the full support of the United States Consular authorities at Dhahran. The status of the Consulate there was raised to that of Consulate-General in 1949. Its officers pay regular visits to Bahrain to attend to the requirements of United States nationals. Apart from an occasional thirst for information they make no attempt to interfere in local political matters and readily co-operate with the British political authorities when the occasion arises. The Arabian-American Oil Company at Dhahran maintains an office in Manamah and its American personnel frequently visit Bahrain for recreational purposes. They also come to the Political Agent to get married, as they cannot be legally married on the mainland. 105. Although Anglo-American relations on the spot at Bahrain are excellent. Sir Roger Makins in his report on his visit to the Persian Gulf in 1952 called attention to the lack of real understanding between the two Governments on political and strategic objectives in the area.( 21 ' J ) In a memorandum prepared by Her Majesty's Embassy at Jedda in the same year reference is made to ' signs of an increasing American impatience with our present position and policy in the Gulf ' and to remarks by prominent Americans ' that some or all of the Gulf States in special treaty relations with Her Majesty's Government are anachronisms.'( 211 ) 106. A mission of the Dutch Reformed Church of America has been established in Bahrain since the beginning of the century. It has its own hospital, school and Church. It has performed valuable medical work not only in Bahrain but also in Qatar and Saudi Arabia but has made few, if any, converts. Generally speaking its relations both with the Ruler and the British political authorities have been good. {h) France and the Netherlands 107. Representatives from the French and Dutch Missions and Consulates in Iraq have visited Bahrain from time to time informally, with the approval of Her Majesty's Government. At the end of 1953 Her Majesty's Government agreed that the French consular representative at Basra should be at liberty to pay short visits to Bahrain and the other Shaikhdoms for the purpose of exercising purely consular functions.(' ') Advance notice of each visit was to be given to the Political Resident. The French are chiefly interested in their air-lines which call at Muharraq. Several visits were paid by their representatives from Iraq after the Air France crashes in 1950 (paragraph 127 below) and French decorations were bestowed on a number of persons who had taken part in the rescue work. The Dutch are interested in their shipping. Dutch ships call frequently at Bahrain and a local merchant acts as agent for them. VII.—Miscellaneous {a) Jurisdiction 108. As related in the Historical Summary of Events for 1907-1928(- a3 ) Shaikh Isa in 1909 asked in writing that he should be relieved by His Majesty's Government of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in his country ^Appendix G (i)). He subsequently explained that he did not intend the term ' foreigners ' to include the subjects of other Gulf States. His son Abdullah when he visited the United Kingdom in 1919 asked on his father's behalf that the latter should be put on an equality with neighbouring Arab rulers in the exercise of authority over all persons other than subjects of Great Britain and the Great European Powers and so over Arabs who were not Bahrain subjects.( 211 ) It was then proposed that he should be permitted to exercise jurisdiction over the subjects of other Arab Rulers, subject to the formal concurrence of those Rulers. According to the Historical Summary of Events( 215 ) Ibn Saud and the Ruler of Qatar took exception to the exercise of control over their subjects by the Ruler of Bahrain and requested the Political Agent to exercise the jurisdiction in question. It is doubtful whether this is an accurate description of what occurred and it would appear that (210) p ara 102 at p. 24. Sir Roger Makins' Report.

Jurisdiction was exercised accordingly until 1952. The Order in Coimcil oi . . 1 r r a new Order in 1949 to give effect to changes rendered necessary by the transfer of responsibility for the Gulf States from the Government ot India to His Majesty s Government. A further Order was issued in 1952 embodying a number of changes in the composition of the Courts and other jurisdictional matters. 109. In April 1949 Shaikh Salman wrote with reference to the Order in Council of 1913 asking to be supplied with copies of any letters from the Shaikh of Bahrain in which he requested or agreed that Arabs ot Kuwait and Qatar or the Trucial Coast should be subject to the powers conferred by the Order.( 2J ') In June when he had been supplied with a copy of the 1949 Order in Council he wrote to the Political Agent drawing attention to the discrimination made between Bahrain and neighbouring States (Kuwait and Qatar) in the matter of jurisdiction over^the Arab subjects of such neighbouring States, denying that the term ' foreigners ' in Shaikh Isa's letter covered Arabs and asking that the operation of the new Order in Council should be suspended until this and other questions which he had in mind had been considered and replied to by His Majesty's Government. In February 1950 he asked also for the cession to him of jurisdiction over Saudi Arabians as a result of a letter which he had received from the Amir of Hasa asking him to interfere in the administration of the estate of a deceased Saudi merchant which was being dealt with in the Court of the Political Agent( 218 ) (paragraph 80 above). In April 1950 Salman was informed that His Majesty's Government were willing to cede to him jurisdiction over the subjects of Kuwait, Qatar and the Trucial Coast and that steps were being taken to amend the Order in Council.( 219 ) The Rulers of Kuwait and Qatar but not of the Trucial States were also informed of His Majesty's Government's intentions. Early in 1951 Salman was told that His Majesty's Government were willing to cede to him jurisdiction over nationals not only of Saudi Arabia but of Muscat and Yemen as well,( 220 ) but it was not until 1952 that a formal exchange of letters took place confirming the cession of jurisdiction to him (Appendix G (ii) and (hi)). In November 1952 the Ruler asked for the cession of jurisdiction over Persians. It was agreed that this request should be granted and he was informed accordingly in 195 3( 221 ) but there was no formal exchange of letters on the subject. An amending Order-in-Council( 222 ) giving effect to this change in jurisdiction came into force in September 1953. 110. In April 1952 the Ruler wrote to the Political Agent that while he was willing to agree that cases between foreigners should be heard in other Courts than his own, subject always to his prior consent in each case, he desired that unless he agreed otherwise the foreigners who lived in his country should be subject to his laws and regulations in the same way as foreigners living in other countries are subject to the laws of the countries in which they stay.( 223 ) The Political Agent informed him orally that it was not possible to agree to his proposals and he did not press them. The Political Resident expressed the opinion that the Ruler's main anxiety was that foreign firms should not be permitted to set up business in Bahrain without his consent, and that while in Bahrain they should be subject both to his laws and to his executive direction, and thought it probable that the matter would be brought up again when the company law which was beins drafted (paragraph 24 above) was ready for discussion.

The Court of the Political Agent Bahrain is better organised and has more work to do than that of the other Political Agents. Early in 1953 the place of the Pakistani Judicial Assistant, who tried all except the more serious cases, was taken by a British Registrar. ' Mixed cases ' are tried by a Joint Court on which a Judge of the Political Agent's Court and a Magistrate of a Bahrain Government Court sit together, and there is a Joint Court of Appeal on which the Ruler and Political Agent usually sit together. Numerous Regulations, to several of which reference has already been made, have been issued under the Orders in Council. {b) Facilities for the Royal Navy 112. In 1933 it was decided in principle to transfer the Naval base from Henjam to Bahrain and a site was selected for it at Jufair on the main island. Early in 1934 negotiations for its purchase and also for the purchase of land required for the Royal Air Force (paragraph 115 below) were initiated with the Bahrain Government without its being disclosed to the Ruler or the public that the land at Jufair was required for the Royal Navy. The purchase was completed in April 1934 and title deeds for all the property acquired were received from the Ruler with a letter in which he conferred on His Majesty's Government the use of the foreshore adjacent to the lands and the right to construct a pier and other works( 224 ) (Appendix H (i)). The Political Agent in his report noted that it would be necessary to preserve a path to a small mosque on the Jufair site as a kind of right of way and to pay compensation in the event of fish-traps being spoiled. A number of fish-traps were subsequently purchased by the Royal Navy. 113. The Ruler was not notified of the proposal to transfer the Naval base to Bahrain until April 1935. He then replied to a letter written to him by the Political Agent on the subject that he welcomed the transfer with great pleasure (Appendix H (ii) and (hi)). The buildings and works required at Jufair were constructed by the Bahrain Government without any demand for the remuneration of their staff or for overhead charges.( 225 ) The Ruler at the request of the Political Agent granted Customs and other facilities to the Royal Navy (Appendix H (iv) and (v)), and His Majesty's thanks for these facilities and for the assistance afforded in the construction of the buildings were formally conveyed to him and suitably acknowledged. 114. The Persian Gulf Division of the Royal Navy anchored off Jufair on April 13, 1935 and the White Ensign was ceremonially hoisted there.( 226 ) Since then Jufair has been the headquarters of the Royal Navy in the Persian Gulf. In 1946 some of the naval buildings there were made available for the Residency when it was transferred from Bushire and subsequently a portion of the site was allotted to the Residency for the construction of new buildings. In 1953 the Bahrain Government gave full consideration to the Royal Navy's requirements when preparing their project for a deep-water jetty at Jufair. ic) Facilities for the Royal Air Force 115. The Royal Air Force appear to have made use of Bahrain probably from before the period under review without any formal understanding with the Ruler but no doubt with his concurrence. In 1929 they laid moorings at Khor Lupin for their flying-boats and purchased the old quarantine station as a rest camp. This land has since been sold back to the Ruler. In 1930 they rented land for an aerodrome between Manamah and Jufair. This has also since been returned to the Ruler. In 1931 they transferred their moorings to Khor Qalaiyah. In 1934 they purchased land at Muharraq additional to that rented for the civil aerodrome, which they were now using, as their own aerodrome on the main island had proved unsuitable,( 227 ) and also a site at Qadhabiyah where they later built a residence. In the same year when the Civil Air Agreement was signed (paragraph 119 below) the Ruler agreed in an exchange of letters that the Royal Air Force should enjoy priority in the use of any aerodromes maintained for civil aircraft without specific permission and that the use of such aerodromes should be accorded free of charge (Appendix I (i) and (ii)). In 1935 the Political Resident agreed that the seaplane unit of the Royal Air Force at ( 224 ) I.O. to F.O. P.Z. 2741/34 of April 27, 1934 (E 2680/231/91 of 1934). ( 225 ) I.O. to F.O.

In 1945 the Ruler presented some land at Muharraq as a gift from himself to the Royal Air Force. In 1945 the Air Ministry considered the purchase of the area at Muharraq held in lease under the Civil Air Agreement of 1934( 232 ) but abandoned the proposal when the Agreement was extended for a further period of seven years.i 23 ') In 1946 the Bahrain Government concluded an agreement with the Air Ministry whereby they became responsible for the supply of electricity in an emergency to the Royal Air Force at Muharraq. In 1947 the Royal Air Force withdrew most of their personnel from Bahrain leaving a small care and maintenance party only. The Air Liaison Officer continued to function until 1950 when the appointment of Senior Royal Air Force Omcer Persian Gulf was created and a Group Captain appointed to it. This officer is responsible to the Air Officer Commanding at Habbamyah m Iraq for all Royal Air Force matters in the Persian Gulf area excluding those relating to the airnelds at Salalah and Masirah in Muscat territory, which are the concern of the Air Officer Commanding at Aden. 116. In 1947 there was some talk of the abandonment of the Muharraq aerodrome by the Royal Air Force. There was no civil authority ready to take it over and they remained in charge of it. The existing aerodrome belongs to the Royal Air Force but a new runway (paragraph 130 below) is to be constructed at the cost of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The aerodrome is classified as ' joint user ' and the position of the Royal Air Force Commanding Officer vis-a-vis the Civil Aerodrome Commandant has been carefully defined in the terms of reference issued to the latter (paragraph 128 below). The Royal Air Force's relations with the Ruler are badly defined, and the mission from the Ministry of Civil Aviation which visited Bahrain in 1953 commented on this and mentioned a suggestion that the exchange of letters with the Ruler regulating the Royal Air Force's special position should be expanded to define that position in rather more detail.( 234 ) id) Facilities for the Army 117. After the end of the Second World War the Army was not represented in the Persian Gulf until 1952 when as the result of a visit of the Commander-in- thief. Middle East Land Forces to Bahrain, a Brigadier was appointed as Military Adviser to the Political Resident, and as representative of the Commander-in- Chief, Middle East Land Forces in the Persian Gulf area. It was his duty to advise the Political Resident on {a) all Army matters {b) the development and employment of theTrucial Oman Levies and (c) local defence.( 235 ) In 1953 it was decided to set up a military command in Bahrain partly for the control of the Trucial Oman Levies and of the operations on the Trucial Coast. The Ruler was informed that the command was to be set up ' to supervise the training and administration of those ( 2S8 ) I.O. to F.O.

He was told that it was not proposed to appoint more than four officers and fifteen other ranks, and that the office would be situated in the Royal Air Force Camp at Muharraq where the other ranks would live. The Ruler agreed to these proposals on the conditions stated about the number and residence of the personnel (Appendix J (i) and (ii)). The Brigadier who had previously been designated Military Adviser to the Political Resident was accordingly appointed Senior Army Officer, Persian Gulf and the command set up as proposed. (e) Civil Aviation 118. In 1929 the Bahrain Government asked Imperial Airways to provide subsidiary services from Basra or Bushire to Bahrain during the pearling season. Their request was considered both in 1929 and 1930 but not implemented owing to the difficulty of obtaining Ibn Saud's permission for the use of emergency landing-grounds in Hasa. In 1932 Imperial Airways were forced by Persian intransigence to transfer their through route to India to the Arabian side of the Gulf. They obtained the permission of the Bahrain Government to use the landing-ground on Muharraq Island and the service through Bahrain started in October. In 1933 the Ruler agreed to the use of Bahrain for landings by the Royal Dutch Air Transport Company provided they came to some arrangement with him, and asked that instructions should be issued prohibiting private flying over his territory. 119. In 1932 before Imperial Airways started their service through Bahrain their representative presented to the Financial Adviser a draft agreement between them and the Ruler. The terms of this were under discussion for a long time and in August 1933 His Majesty's Government issued instructions regarding the uniform procedure to be followed in negotiating air facilities with the Gulf Rulers.( 236 ) Negotiations with Hamad were continued accordingly and a Civil Air Agreement was signed on June 6, 1934.( 237 ) This gave His Majesty's Government exclusive rights to establish and maintain aerodromes and ancillary services within his territories and a number of other privileges in return for an annual rental of £500 for a period of four years. At the same time Air Navigation Regulations were made by the Ruler. These were in due course enforced against persons subject to the Order in Council bv a King's Regulation^ 238 ) Imperial Airways were appointed His Majesty's Government's agents under the Agreement and the Regulations accompanying it.( 239 ) 120. In 1936 the Bahrain Government granted authorisation for certain special aircraft of the Dutch Air Line K.L.M. to land at Bahrain in case of emergency. Subsequently the K.L.M. aircraft which had not been authorised landed there. A protest made by the Bahrain Government was brought to the notice of the K.L.M. authorities through the Netherlands Government and an apology was received.( 2t0 ) 121. In 1937 Imperial Airways decided to establish a flying-boat service to Bahrain and the Ruler agreed to certain amendments which became necessary to the Air Navigation Regulations and other documents attached to the Civil Air Agreement of 1934.( 241 ) The amendments to the Air Navigation Regulations were not applied to persons subject to the Order in Council by a King's Regulation. The company were allowed to use an undefined area of the sea off Manamah and the only rent they were asked to pay was Rs. 25 a year for the site of their passenger shelter.( 242 ) The area of the Muharraq aerodrome was defined in 1937 and a copy of a map of it given to the Bahrain Governments 243 ) ( 236 ) I.O toF.O.

In 1945 he accepted a definition of the term aerodrome which had been proposed to him.C'). 123. In 1939 K.L.M. wished to establish an air service through Bahrain but at first the Political Resident and other authorities were opposed to the proposal The question of permitting French and Dutch aviation companies to use the ra route had been considered in 1932 but was then considered impracticable and it had been found possible to put the Dutch off since then. The French do not appear to have pressed the matter. Eventually in 1940 it was found desirable to give permission to K.L.M. to supplement the services of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (who had taken the place of Imperial Airways) as a wartime measure only. 124. In 1945 it was decided to obtain an extension of the Civil Air Agreement considerably in advance of the date on which it was due to expire mainly to provide cover for the erection of storage tanks for aviation fuel by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company on a Royal Air Force site, with regard to which the Bahrain Petroleum Company were expected to raise difficulties! 247 ) (paragraph 66 above). In February 1946 the Ruler was asked to agree to the further extension of the Agreement for seven years from December 31, 1948, as His Majesty's Government wished to secure their position for some time ahead before incurring any additional expenditure upon aerodromes and aviation facilities in Bahrain.( 248 ) At the same time he was asked to agree to an amendment of Article 4 of the Agreement, the result of which was to authorise Her Majesty's Government to permit foreign aircraft to use the Bahrain aerodromes without consulting him, and to certain minor amendments in the accompanying documents. He accepted all these proposals and in August 1946 agreed to an amendment in Article 3 of the Agreement which was consequential on the amendment in Article 4. In 1947 the schedule of landing-fees attached to the Agreement was revised.( 249 ) In 1951 a further revision of this Schedule took place.( 250 ) This had the effect of reducing the fees payable on the Gulf Aviation Company's aircraft, a matter about which complaints had been received from the Bahrain Government and the Company's manager. 125. In 1947 the possibility was considered of constructing a new aerodrome at Hamalah on the west coast of the main island.( 251 ) The site had been surveyed by the Royal Air Force in 1944 and 1945 (paragraph 115 above) and had certain advantages over the Muharraq site but the proposal was abandoned as being too expensive. 126. B.O.A.C. flying-boat services continued, with a break in the first half of 1947 which led to many complaints, until 1949 when land-plane services took their place, the Manamah marine base being handed over to the Royal Air Force. In 1949 the company completed an air-conditioned rest house in Manamah and in the following year they opened a new office there. In 1947 Iraqi Airways established a service from Iraq, via Kuwait, to Bahrain. This is not covered by ( 244 ) I.O. to F.O.

(' 5 ) In 1951 Bosworth was killed in a flying accident in the United Kingdom and the Company was for a time in difficulties. The British Overseas Airways Corporation eventually acquired Bosworth's shares and took over control of it( 254 ) In 1953 it maintained services from Bahrain to Dhahran, Dohah and Sharjah and was beginning to pay its way. Cyprus Airways maintain a regular service to Bahrain. Other aviation companies, e.g., Aden Airways and Air Djibuti have proposed scheduled services to or through Bahrain, but have not yet established them. Many foreign lines are classed as occasional users of the areodrome but are not permitted to exercise traffic rights. 127. In August 1947 a British Overseas Airways Corporation flying-boat crashed when landing and there were some fatal casualties. An official enquiry was held. In June 1950 during a period of bad visibility two Air France aircraft crashed into the sea at night while approaching the Muharraq aerodrome within forty-eight hours of each other with heavy loss of life.( 255 ) The Ministry of Civil Aviation sent out an Inspector of Accidents and a formal enquiry was held provision for which was made in a specially enacted King's Regulation^ 56 ) which has since been repealed. Opinions had been expressed that the accidents were due to inadequate night-landing facilities at Muharraq but the enquiry found that this was not the case and that none of the ground staff there were in any way to blame. It was however decided as a result of the accidents to improve the approach lighting at Muharraq. 128. In August 1949 when the flying-boat services were about to cease the Political Resident called attention to the lack of co-ordination at the Muharraq airport and suggested the appointment of a Civil Manager.^ 57 ) The aerodrome was owned by the Royal Air Force who maintained a care and maintenance party there under a junior officer who was the final overall authority. International Aeradio Limited were responsible for control of aircraft in the air and for safety regulations as the agents of the Royal Air Force, while the British Overseas Airways Corporation, who were presumably as successors of Imperial Airways His Majesty's Government's agents under the Civil Air Agreement, were about to make an increasing use of the aerodrome. The whole matter remained under discussion for many months during which there was increasing friction between the authorities concerned until in June 1951 an official of the Ministry of Civil Aviation was appointed as Civil Commandant of the airport. He was provided with detailed terms of reference under which his duties were confined to Bahrain, except for advice to the Political Resident about day to day civil aviation problems on which he might be consulted and ad hoc assignments by the Ministry of Civil Aviation.( 258 ) In December 1952 a new incumbent was appointed as Civil Aerodrome Commandant, Muharraq Aerodrome, Bahrain.( 259 ) His duties were the same as those of his predecessor except that he was also appointed as Ministry of Civil Aviation Representative, Persian Gulf, and charged with the supervision of the aerodromes at Sharjah, Kuwait and Dohah. 129. In May 1952 letters were exchanged with the Ruler whereby amendments were made to Articles 2, 4 and 5 of the Civil Air Agreement and the Air Navigation Regulations attached to it were completely revised.( 260 ) The amendments covered the appointment of agents by Her Majesty's Government and the Ruler, and the grant or refusal of certain privileges by Her Majesty's Government to aircraft of all nationalities. The Ruler did not issue a decree enforcing the revised Air Navigation Regulations until October 1953. A draft Queen's Regulation applying them to persons subject to the Order in Council was under consideration at the end of the ( 252 ) Baghdad to F.O.

A Mission of the Ministry of Civil Aviation which the Persian Gulf in 1953 made it clear that their main interest there was the retention by Her Majesty's Goevrnment of the necessary control at Muharraq aerodrome and of the right to grant or withhold traffic rights applied for by fore1 ^ wishing to use Bahrain.( 263 ) The question of security of tenure at the Muharraq aerodrome was of particular importance in view of the P r ^P 0 ^ a ^ t n runway at the cost of £500,000. The Civil Air Agreement of 1934 was due to expire in 1955 and a new agreement had been drafted with a view to obtaining security of tenure before work on the new runway started. Both the new agreement and new runway were discussed with the Financial Adviser who expected the Ruler to raise difficulties only over the amount to be paid to him under the agreement. The Bahrain Government had in 1952 agreed to the rectification of the boundaries of the Muharraq aerodrome without any difficulty and raised no difficulty in principle to the acquisition of additional land for the new runway, negotiations for which continued during 1953.(' ' 4 ) if) Slavery 131. In 1937 Shaikh Hamad issued a decree reminding the public that it was forbidden to own slaves in Bahrain (Appendix K). The Political Resident reported in 1952 that long before the issue of this decree the Bahrain Courts had refused to recognise the existence of slavery, but that it was probable there were still some servants whom their masters regarded as slaves.C ') The local Government Courts refuse to admit any case in which rights of ownership in a slave are a point at issue, since should such a case reach a Shara Court it could not avoid treating slavery as a legal institution. ig) Arms 132. In 1898 the Ruler issued a decree prohibiting the import and export of arms and ammunition in accordance with the undertaking( 2&lt;,(i ) which he had given in that year to Her Majesty's Government, together with a proclamation granting British and Persian men-of-war the right to search Bahrain vessels for arms and ammunition (Appendix L (i)). The prohibition of the import and export of arms and ammunition was repeated in a decree of 1936 which also provided for the licensing of arms. This decree was applied to persons subject to the Order in Council by a King's Regulation^ 267 ) In a revised version of the 1936 decree issued in 1943 provision was made for arms to be imported and exported with the permission of the Bahrain Government (Appendix L (ii) ).( 268 ) In addition to the Bahrain Government's permission any person desirous of importing arms has in practice also to obtain a No Objection Certificate from the Political Agent (chapter 1, paragraph 42), and the Bahrain authorities will not ordinarily allow the import into the country of any arms not covered by such a certificate. In 1950 the Ruler issued a notice forbidding the hunting of game without his permission (Appendix L (iii)). (/?) Banks 133. In 1920 a branch of the Eastern Bank was opened in Bahrain. There was no formal agreement with the Ruler but his permission was obtained. In 1944 with the Ruler's concurrence the Imperial Bank of Iran (now the British Bank of the Middle East) was allowed to open a branch in Bahrain. At the same time the Ruler gave an undertaking not to permit any other bank to open a branch in Bahrain for ten years (Appendix M (i) and (ii)). The Ruler formally opened new premises of the Imperial Bank of Iran in 1950 and of the Eastern Bank in 1951. ( 261 ) The Regulation issued in January 1954 (No. 1 of 1954).

In 1911 the Ruler agreed not to permit any foreign power to open a post office in Bahrain.( 2 ' 9 ) In 1931 the Bahrain Government asked that the stamps sold by the Government of India Post Office should be surcharged 'Bahrain.'( 270 ) It was agreed to grant the request and the Universal Postal Union was notified accordingly. This led to protests from the Persians (paragraph 82 above) and some delay ensued but the surcharged stamps were eventually issued in 1933. In 1946 a Post Office was opened in Muharraq. On the transfer of power in India in 1947 the Government of Pakistan assumed charge of the Post Offices temporarily and on April 1, 1948, they were taken over by the General Post Office who issued British stamps surcharged with ' Bahrain ' and rupee values. A British Postal Superintendent was appointed for all the Gulf Post Offices administered by the General Post Office with his headquarters at Bahrain. 135. In 1946 the Ruler informed the Political Agent that he would like to examine the possibility of Bahrain having its own stamps and postal service.( 271 ) In 1947 when consulted about the proposed transfer of the Post Offices from the Government of India to His Majesty's Government he replied expressing a desire to take over the postal administration and issue his own stamps, but eventually agreed that His Majesty's Government should take over the administration as a tentative step and that for the time being surcharged British stamps should be used.C' 2 ) He returned to the charge from time to time and in 1952 while stating that his ultimate object was to operate and administer all the postal services at Bahrain, asked that as a temporary measure stamps bearing his likeness should be used for the internal postal service and enquired whether it was possible for his State to begin to operate this service.( 27;i ) In commenting on this representation the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs remarked that although in the long term it might be inevitable that the Bahrain Government should take over all the postal services in Bahrain, the objection to this had already been explained to the Ruler and that it was hoped that it would be possible to concentrate on the immediate problem of the local services.( 274 ) It was agreed that the Ruler should issue stamps bearing his likeness for internal use and that the internal postal service should be transferred to the Bahrain Government in stages. Stamps were issued accordingly and the transfer of the internal postal service initiated. It was also agreed that the British Postal Superintendent should be appointed by the Bahrain Government as their postal adviser and paid an allowance by them for his work in this capacity. (/) Telecommunications and Broadcasting 136. In 1928 the Indo-European Telegraph Department were in charge of the telegraph station at Bahrain( 275 ) which had been established in 1916 on the basis of the undertaking! 276 ) given to His Majesty's Government by Shaikh Isa in 1912. In 1931 they were succeeded by the Imperial and International Communications Company which in 1934 changed it name to Cable and Wireless Ltd. In that year the company took over all responsibility for communications with aircraft. In 1935 Bahrain was connected by cable with the Bushire-Karachi cable, the Ruler's consent having been obtained to the landing of the cable.( 277 ) Since the war Bushire has been disconnected and the cable has become unservicable. 137. After the Italian air-raid on the refinery in 1940 (paragraph 15 above) the Bahrain Petroleum Company asked for permission to establish communications by radio-telephone for both defence and operational purposes with the Californian Arabian Standard (later Arabian American) Oil Company at Dhahran. Permission was granted on certain conditions( 278 ) and the service began in June 1952. 138. In 1945 an agreement was reached between Cable and Wireless Ltd. and the Bahrain Government for the installation and operation by the former of an ( 269 ) No. 9 I, T.C. ( 270 ) I.O. to F.O.

T h ere were V ^^ S tn d r es1ie and the implementation of the agreement from which the company system was not inaugurated until 1948. 139 In 1947 it was considered desirable that Cable and Wireless Ltd. should obtain a formal concession from the Ruler. An agreement was which gave them for 20 years a monopoly to operate telecommunication services between Bahrain and the outside world and public telephone services mside Bahrain subject to certain conditions (Appendix N). 140. In 1949 Cable and Wireless Ltd. established a telephone service between Bahrain and London. This was later extended to New York, and services were also established with Kuwait, Dohah and Muscat. 141. In 1951 Cable and Wireless Ltd. agreed that International Aeradio Ltd. should be allowed to conduct all aeronautical telecommunications at Bahrain on the understanding that this action would not be held to prejudice the position of Cable and Wireless Ltd. elsewhere.^' 9 ) 142. The public telephone system installed by Cable and Wireless Ltd. under the 1947 agreement soon became inadequate for local needs. In 1952 they prepared a scheme for installing many more connections but demanded increased rent. This greatly incensed the Ruler and the local merchants and there was a demand by the latter that the Bahrain Government should take over the system, but the increased rates proposed by the company were eventually accepted. 143. With the agreement of the Ruler and the Political Agent permission is granted for the operation of private radio transmitters and frequencies are allotted by the Political Residency after consultation with the Communications Board Middle East when necessary.( 280 ) Legislation on the subject has been discussed but not yet enacted.( 2sl ) 144. A local broadcasting station was operated in Bahrain during the last war by the British Information Services. In 1949 it was proposed to set up a broadcasting station to be financed jointly by His Majesty's Government and the Bahrain Government^ 282 ) Use was to be made of the Cable and Wireless installations. This proposal was dropped partly on grounds of expense and partly because at that time the Voice of America were contemplating the establishment of a broadcasting station in Bahrain which would have been made available for transmission on behalf of His Majesty's Government and the Ruler. The Voice of America's Scheme was abandoned and the matter remained in abeyance for a few years. In 1952 the Bahrain Petroleum Company proposed to present a small broadcasting station to the Bahrain Government and the question of staffing and working it was discussed with the Head of the Near East Broadcasting Station and the Regional Information Officer Middle East who visited Bahrain at the end of 1952 and beginning of 1953 respectively^ 283 ) The former offered assistance and some engineers were sent to Bahrain. The Bahrain Petroleum Company later said they were only willing to provide the technical equipment and that the Bahrain Government must construct the building. No further development had taken place by the end of 1953. (k) Medical and Quarantine 145. In the days of the Government of India an officer of the Indian Medical Department used to be posted to Bahrain as Agency Surgeon and Quarantine Medical Officer. He was in charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital in Manamah. This was built from public subscriptions after the death of Queen Victoria and maintained as a charitable dispensary. After His Majesy's Government took over responsibility for the Gulf States a British Quarantine Medical Officer was appointed who worked under the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer at the Residency The Victoria Memorial Hospital was closed to the general public in 1948 but used for a few years for the treatment of the Residency and Agency staff. It was eventually abandoned as unsafe and dismantled. Its site has been recorded in the Bahrain Government's Land Registration office as e 7!) ) M.C.A. to F.O.

After its abandonment the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer kept a small dispensary at Jufair for the treatment of the Residency and Agency staff. 146. In 1928 the Bahrain Government appointed a British State Medical Officer and in 1939 a British lady doctor. In 1940 the construction of a State Hospital was completed. Since then the hospital has been extended and additional British medical personnel have been employed. The medical facilities provided are adequate but have been criticised locally owing, it is believed, to the greater number of experts and superior equipment which Kuwait with its greater financial resources has been able to afford, in addition to the State Hospital the Dutch Reformed Church of America (paragraph 106 above) maintains a Mission hospital which has much popular support. 147. The Bahrain Government started anti-malarial work in 1937 and in 1938 obtained the advice on this subject of an expert from India. As a result of the measures which they have continued to take, malaria has been almost eliminated. In 1952 preliminary arrangements were made for a World Health Organisation team to visit Bahrain to advise the local Government regarding the steps to be taken to combat tuberculosis( 2vl ) but the proposal came to nothing as the Bahrain Government were unwilling to meet all the expenditure involved. In 1953 a representative of the Red Cross Society visited Bahrain in the hope of establishing a local branch but met with little support. In 1946 a Bahrain Medical Society was formed which included British Government, State and oil company doctors and in 1951 a Persian Gulf Medical Society was founded at Bahrain. 148. Until 1950 quarantine arrangements at Bahrain were conducted first by the Government of India and then by His Majesty's Government, the Bahrain Government making a small contribution towards the expenditure. In 1950 the Bahrain Government took over the whole quarantine service but accepted the supervisory control of His Majesty's Government while the latter remained internationally responsible for their quarantine arangements.( 285 ) They also took over the services of the British Quarantine Medical Officer and made him in addition their Public Health Officer. The Chief Quarantine Medical Officer at the Residency continues to exercise supervision and the system has worked satisfactorily. (/) Nationality and Passports 149. A Bahrain Nationality Law was signed by the Ruler in February 1937 and published the following May (Appendix O (i)). As it enacted that foreigners who wished to avoid becoming Bahrain nationals under certain of its provisions should register at the Political Agency an amending Order in Council was issued in order to provide for such registration. This was repealed when the Order in Council of 1949 came into force. 150. Passport control was first introduced by the Bahrain Government in 1929 and the State began to issue its own passports in 1930, when a proclamation on the subject was issued by the Ruler (Appendix O (ii)). Nationals of the other Gulf Shaikhdoms, Muscat and Saudi Arabia are allowed to enter Bahrain without visas provided they are in possession of valid travel documents. As the Persian Government does not recognise Bahrain passports Persians in Bahrain are given special papers enabling them to leave Bahrain to visit their country and to return to Bahrain. Her Majesty's Missions and Consulates are authorised to grant visas for Bahrain on behalf of the Ruler to all foreigners but it is customary to consult the Bahrain Government before visas are granted to Indians and' Pakistanis (paragraph 96 above). British passports are granted to Bahrain nationals as British protected persons for travel to countries where the Ruler's passports are not recognised. im) Ecclesiastical 151. An Anglican Church was opened in Bahrain in 1953 on a site presented by the Ruler. It is within the diocese of the Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem and it and the priest in charge of it are supported by local subscriptions. A Roman ( 284 ) (USD 11016/12 of 1952.)

The pearl fisheries of Bahrain and the Persian Gulf in general are described in great detail in Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.( ) During the period under review they have given rise to no political problem but the pearl industry as a whole has suffered a very serious decline and except in the Trucial States, where no oil has yet been produced, has ceased to have any substantial economic importance. The first blow to the industry was the introduction of the Japanese cultured pearl in the 'thirties of this century, and it suffered a further decline from the lack of demand resulting from the war and its aftermath. Apart from this most of the class who used to obtain a precarious livelihood from pearling now prefer regular and more lucrative employment with an oil company. At the beginning of the century according to Lorimer the number of Bahrain boats employed in pearling exceeded 900. In 1953 the number was only 30. ( 286 ) App. C, Part II, Lorimer, Vol. I.57 CHAPTER 3 KUWAIT I.—General 1. Shaikh Ahmad al Jabir K.C.S.I. (1944) K.C.LE. (1930) ruled Kuwait from the death of his uncle Salim in March 1921 until his own death on January 29, 1950. In 1933 he was granted a personal salute of four guns in addition to his dynastic salute of seven guns and in 1937 he was accorded the dynastic title of His Highness. He was always loyal to his engagements with His Majesty's Government but at the same time careful to prevent the establishment of too much British influence within his State. He was stronger in manner than he was in action and was at times weak in dealing with his relations by whom he was nearly unseated in 1938. He visited the United Kingdom in 1935 and was received in audience by His Majesty. Towards the end of his reign with the acquisition of wealth he became increasingly arrogant. In 1949 while on a prolonged visit to Bahrain he failed to call on the Political Resident. He subsequently apologised but complained that no representative of the Residency or Agency had met him on his arrival. Since then it has been a practice for a junior officer of the Residency or Agency to meet the Ruler of Kuwait on his landing at Bahrain. On his death messages of condolence were communicated to his family by His Majesty's Government and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs but a message from His Majesty the King was considered unsuitable^ 1 ) 2. Ahmad on his death was succeeded by his first cousin the present Ruler Shaikh Abdullah al Salim, K.C.M.G., (1952) C.I.E. (1938). Preparations had been made for dealing with the situation in the event of a disputed succession but there was no opposition. There was some idea of making Abdullah al Salim's recognition by His Majesty's Government as Ruler conditional on his agreeing to employ a British Adviser but in view of his unanimous acceptance by the ruling family and the general public this was considered impracticable and the Political Resident was authorised to convey His Majesty's Government's recognition. This he did in a formal letter which was acknowledged by Abdullah who promised to observe all the treaties and agreements entered into by his predecessors and to go the same way as his grandfather (the ' great ' Mubarak).( 2 ) A formal accession ceremony was held on February 25, the anniversary of which Abdullah usually celebrates. He was born about 1891 and was old, tired and in poor health when he succeeded. Up to date he has shown himself a well-intentioned but rather weak Ruler and in particular he has been unwilling to take action to keep his relations under control. He spends much time away from his capital on cruises in the Persian Gulf or on visits to the Lebanon, India or Europe and has on two or three occasions talked of abdication. He visited the United Kingdom in 1953 for Her Majesty's Coronation. He was accorded a salute of 11 guns (7 dynastic and 4 personal) on his accession. In December 1950 the total number of guns was increased to 13 and it has since been recommended that the whole of this salute should be regarded as dynastic (cf. chapter 2, paragraph 2). 3. All the more important offices of State are held by members of the ruling family. Abdullah al Mubarak C.I.E. (1945) a posthumous son of the 'great' Mubarak and uncle of the Ruler, is regarded, though the position is never made absolutely clear, as ranking next in order of precedence after him and as acting as regent during his journeys abroad. He is in charge of the gendarmerie and of security. The Ruler has two half brothers by slave mothers, Fahad who presides over the Kuwait Municipality and the Development Board and Subah who is in charge of the Town Police. Fahad has a strong and unscrupulous personality and is better educated than most other members of the ruling family. Abdullah al Jabir C.I.E. (1946) is in charge of the departments of Justice, Education and Auqaf. Of the late Ruler's sons the third Jabir, who is of pure Arab birth, his mother being the present Ruler's sister, is the most prominent. He is serving under Abdullah al Mubarak. There is strong faction feeling between the Jabir and Salim branches of the family. The ruling family's allowances are comparatively small, C) Tel. from P.O. to P.R. 33 of January 31, 1950 (EA 1941 /27 of 1950).

Immediately after Abdullah al Salim's accession the Political Agent suggested to him that he should appoint a successor but he asked that the matter should be allowed to rest. The ' great ' Mubarak succeeded by assassinating ms rivals but since his time on the death of a Ruler the family have selected the successor. Hitherto the choice has been a fairly obvious one but the situation is not quite so clear at present. Abdullah al Mubarak has succeeded in acquiring ^ position which leads to his often being regarded as the heir presumptive, and in 1951 the Political Agent recommended that he should be given His Majesty s Government's support as such, but this suggestion was not approved by the Political Resident.^) He is the son of a Georgian slave and Fahad al Sahm who also almost certainly aspires to the accession has negro blood in him and is very black. If these are both passed over because of their slave origin Jabir al Ahmad would appear to be the most likely candidate. At present the question is entirely an open one and Her Majesty's Government are in no way committed but should the present Ruler abdicate or die at an early date the fact that Abdullah al Mubarak and Fahad's brother Subah al Salim command rival police forces may create a dangerous situation. 5. There has been no important change in the Treaty position vis-a-vis Her Majesty's Government since 1928. In 1935 it was proposed to take up the question of substituting for the series of letters and informal undertakings which govern relations between Her Majesty's Government and the Ruler of Kuwait a compre hensive treaty on the lines of the Qatar Treaty of 1916.0 The Political Resident, however, thought that the proposal would be viewed with suspicion by the Ruler and that owing to His Majesty's Government's failure to resolve the date gardens question, the Iraqi smuggling problem and the Saudi blockade it would be difficult to press him in the matter.C) The proposal was accordingly dropped and so far as is known has not since been renewed. So far as the secret Bandar Shuwaikh Agreement of October 15, 1907( fi ) (Appendix A (i) &amp; (ii)), is concerned the opinion was expressed in the Historical Summary of Events for 1907-280 that although the payment of rent under it was terminated in 1922 it did not appear that the agreement was abrogated and that the reciprocal pledges, so far as they were not affected by other subsequent instruments, presumably remained binding. It would appear that this opinion was correct as in 1931 when the customs duty was raised to 4^ per cent, and the Ruler's attention was called to the tenth article of the agreement, which restricts the duty recoverable from British merchants to 4 per cent., he made no attempt to deny the validity of the article and stated that he had ordered the Director of Customs not to recover more than 4 per cent, duty from British subjects.( 8 ) In 1936 when the customs duty generally was raised to 5 per cent, it was left at 4 per cent, for British subjects. In 1942 the Ruler raised the duty to 6i per cent, and applied the increase to British subjects. The 1907 agreement was not formally invoked but the Ruler was informed that His Majesty's Government agreed to the increase provided he agreed that in accordance with previous practice no further increase in duty should be applied to British subjects without the consent of His Majesty's Government^ 9 ) The Ruler then undertook in writing to consult His Majesty's Government before making any further increase (Appendix B) It may be noted that the 1907 agreement is not one-sided and that His Majesty's Government promised that 'the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to .... the Shaikh of Koweit and to his heirs after him, and that all Shaikh Mubarak's arrangements in the matter of customs, &amp;c., and his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Shaikh Mubarak-as-Subah ruler of Koweit, and his heirs after him.' The agreement amongst other things gives Her Majesty's Government the right of pre-emption over Warbah Island which the Iraqis are anxious to acquire (paragraph 59 below). The extent to which the present Ruler would regard the agreement as binding is uncertain. ( 3 ) P.R. toF.O. 1941/34 of September 29, 1951 (EA 1941 /30 of 1951) ( 4 ) No. 1 III, T.C.

The Rulers of Kuwait have always adopted a somewhat more independent attitude towards Her Majesty's Government than the Rulers of the other Gulf Shaikhdoms. While showing themselves anxious to retain Her Majesty's Govern ment's friendship and protection, without which they could not resist absorption by their more powerful neighbours, they have striven to reduce interference by Her Majesty's Government in their internal affairs to a minimum. Their people are infused with more local national and general Arab feeling than the inhabitants of the other Gulf Shaikhdoms and owing to their proximity to Iraq are more in touch with movements in the Arab world. This tendency has been further increased by the recent influx into Kuwait of many Egyptians, Lebanese, Syrians and Levantines generally. 7. The compiler of the Historical Summary of Events for 1907-28( i0 ) rated Kuwait after Bahrain and Muscat in importance With the discovery of oil in its territory in large quantities and the consequent enormous increase in its revenues the position has entirely changed and in 1953 the views of Her Majesty's Goverment were stated as follows : — ' During the last three years Kuwait has become of prime importance to the United Kingdom and to the sterling area as a whole. It is now a major source of oil supplies and an important element in our balance of payments. The expenditure of its large sterling revenue unless properly directed is capable of inflicting the most serious damage on the sterling area. Her Majesty's Government can no longer afford to confine themselves to the role authorised by the treaties and agreements in force and sanctioned by usage but must also interest themselves in all matters which affect the political and economic stability of Kuwait or which may affect the interests of the United Kingdom in the widest sense.'T 1 ) 8. A Political Agent directly subordinate to the Political Resident was first appointed to Kuwait in 1904. It was not until 1949 that the appointment of an Assistant to the Political Agent was sanctioned as a permanent measure, and since then the Agency Staff has been further increased. In 1953 the post of Political Agent was upgraded and it was decided that on matters which traditionally fell within the responsibility of the Political Resident and on matters common to the Persian Gulf States as a whole the Political Agent should continue to receive instructions from the Political Resident and to report to him but that on matters relating to the internal affairs of Kuwait and particularly to its administration, finance, development and security he should receive instructions from and report to the Foreign Office, copies of the correspondence being sent to the Political Resident. This however was not to detract from the' latter's responsibility for furthering the policies of Her Majesty's Government in Kuwait and in the Persian Gulf as a whole and the Political Agent was to remain under his general supervision.( 12 ) 9. Instructions were issued to the Political Resident who was newly appointed in 1953 in the following terms:—'The subjects on which advice has traditionally been tendered to the ruler must now be expanded. In particular: — (i) It is of the highest importance that the policy of the ruler both in internal and external matters should at all times be in harmony with the interests of Her Majesty's Government. (ii) Discussions may be held with and, where appropriate, advice tendered to the ruler or his officials on all matters which may directly or indirectly involve the interests of Her Majesty's Government, in Kuwait or elsewhere. (hi) Matters covered by (ii) above include specifically— {a) the creation in Kuwait of sound and effective administration; {b) the terms of employment of British advisers and other British personnel; (c) the introduction of a proper financial system; {d) the development programme for Kuwait; ( 10 ) Para. 51 at p. 85, P.G. 13. i 11 ) F.O. to P.R.

In the opening years of the period under review Kuwait was much disturbed by Akhwan raids from Saudi Arabia.('') These ceased 'f 1 ? C0 J1^ of the Akhwan rebellion against Ibn Saud in 1930 and smce ' hen Jf^' roub | ed incursions from Iraq and Saudi Arabia the peace of Kuwait has not been troub by her neighbours. 11. The only internal disturbances worth mentioning t ° ok P 1 ? 06 and 1939. In March 1938 serious agitation broke out against the Ruler who left the conduct of affairs to his Secretary, Khan Bahadur Sahh, the he ^ ° ' present Ruler's Secretary, Abdulla Mulla, and was showing too m ^h favour to a young Syro-Egyptian Izzat Jaafar. The Ruler had the leading agitator flogged until he revealed the names of his associates. Some of these fled and others we about armed. Under instructions from His Majesty's Government the Political Agent took the Ruler to task orally over the repeated flogging of the agitator to obtain information and recommended to him that he should associate himse more with both his family and his people in his administration. He also suggestea the appointment of a British Adviser.(' ') The Ruler returned evasive replies but in July as the result of pressure by his people established an elected administrative Council under the presidency of Abdullah al Salim. It may be noted that the establishment of such a Council had been made a condition of Ahmad's recognition by the people of Kuwait on his accession in 1921,C 1 ') but that though elected it never met. The new Council quickly obtained complete control of the situation and the Ruler became for a time a cypher. In August serious disagreement arose between the Ruler and his Council because the latter demanded the removal of his Secretary, Salih, and the Ruler threatened to abdicate. The Secretary left Kuwait of his own accord. At this time the Ruler asked for a British Adviser and that Kuwait should be dealt with in the same way as Bahrain, but it was considered impossible to accede to his request unless it was supported by the Council.( 17 ) In October under instructions from His Majesty's Government the Political Resident made a written communication to the Ruler expressing satisfaction at the establishment of the Council but assuming that there would be no change in the arrangements by which His Majesty's Government conducted the foreign affairs of Kuwait.( 18 ) A similar communication was made orally to the Council. In December the Ruler decided in view of growing popular opposition to the arbitrary use of its power to dissolve the Council. A tense situation arose but it was eventually decided that there should be fresh elections. These were held and a new Council containing more members was elected. This never met and was dissolved by the Ruler in March 1939 owing to the refusal of its members to agree to his exercising the power of veto over its decisions. This led to further agitation and some rioting but the Ruler managed to obtain control of the situation and after he had executed one of the agitators others were imprisoned or fled and the situation returned to normal. The Ruler then nominated another Council consisting of four members of his family and nine notables. He exercised a power of veto over its decisions and frequently attended its meetings. The Council was reported to have passed away in 1945 but was revived in 1946 and was last heard of in 1948. It is interesting to note that in 1951 the Foreign Office suggested the establishment of a Council or Cabinet which would include some of the Ruler's British employees but that the local political authorities thought the scheme too ambitious.( 1!&gt; ) r) F.O. to P.R.

Izzat Jaafar who is referred to in the last preceding paragraph has been the subject of much correspondence. During the last war His Majesty's Government insisted on his removal from Kuwait because of his suspected intrigues with the Axis powers. He returned after the war and obtained a position of much influence in Ahmad's household. Abdullah al Salim immediately after his accession was pressed by the Political Agent to expel him but demurred and it was eventually agreed that there were insufficient grounds for proceeding further against him and that he should be allowed to stay in Kuwait. In 1951 he wrote to the Secretary of State asking on what grounds the previous Political Agent had demanded his expulsion. He was told that the grounds could not be disclosed but that the case against him would be treated as closed. After this he resumed his duties as Social Secretary at the Ruler's palace and at the end of 1953 was reported to be regaining his influence. 13. Kuwait came into little prominence during the war. There was reported to be a substantial amount of pro-German feeling there at the beginning of it, but it did not manifest itself. Later the Ruler and others contributed generously to the Fighter Fund. There were difficulties from time to time over obtaining supplies for the local population but generally speaking the merchants throve, mostly on illicit trade. Advantage was taken of the shipbuilding facilities at Kuwait for the construction of barges for the use of the forces in Iraq. 14. Kuwait has never had a properly organised administration. No reliable budget has ever been issued, money is allotted by the Ruler to the various departments in a haphazard manner, no check is exercised over their expenditure, and there are no recognised scales of pay for State employees. The various departments are distributed amongst the leading members of the ruling family in the manner already described (paragraph 3 above). It had been suggested to Ahmad in 1938 that he should appoint a British Adviser but when he eventually asked for one it was considered impolitic to accede to his request (paragraph 11 above). When with the production of oil in 1946 the State revenues began to increase by leaps and bounds His Majesty's Government considered it incumbent on them to do their best to ensure that the State was properly administered and that its revenues were used to the best advantage. Alter the events of 1938 the State finances were for a time in the hands of Fahad but in 1940 when it became clear that he had been responsible for substantial defalcations Abdullah al Salim took them over. In 1946 when the question of putting the States' finances on a proper footing was discussed with him, Ahmad himself suggested the appointment of a British Officer for the purpose, and the Political Resident was instructed to encourage this idea.( 20 ) In 1947 he informed the Political Resident that he was thinking of asking for British advisers for finance, customs and police and asked for lists of candidates. In the following year he said that he wished to appoint a British Financial Adviser but that he had to prepare the way and he asked that he should not be hurried. He maintained this attitude for the rest of his life. 15. It had been decided not to make the appointment of a British Financial Adviser a condition precedent for the recognition of Abdullah al Salim as Ruler on Ahmad's death at the beginning of 1950 (paragraph 2 above) but the Political Agent took up the question with him immediately after his accession and received an evasive reply.( 21 ) For some time previous to this care had been taken to avoid the use of the word ' adviser ' in discussing this appointment, as likely to offend Kuwait's susceptibilities, and to substitute ' expert.' In October 1950 the Ruler unexpectedly announced that he had instructed Mr. Kemp, his agent in London, to engage British experts for his Finance and Customs Departments. He subsequently- instructed Kemp to collaborate with the Foreign Office in their selection. 16. In February 1951, Lt.-Col. G. C. L. Crichton, C.S.L, CLE., late of the Indian Political Service, was selected for the Finance Department appointment. The Ruler at first seemed inclined to hand over the whole of the administration to him. He agreed promptly to proposals which Crichton made for the recruitment from the United Kingdom of a State Engineer, an auditor and an accountant. He also agreed to the setting up of a Development Board. Crichton was in due course appointed Controller of Finance but was not placed in charge of the Finance Department. Schemes he proposed for controlling the finances of the departments ( 20 ) I.O. to F.O. Ext. 6066/46 of September 13, 1946 (E 9321/8065/91 of 1946).

Crichton tn ere tore was unable to put the State's financial organisation on a proper looting but by t e end of 1953 he had succeeded in extracting budgets from all except two departments and in ensuring an equitable distribution oi the State s revenue between t p current expenditure and invested reserves. 17. As Crichton's efforts to re-organise the State's administration appeared to be meeting with so little success, Sir Roger Makins when he visited Kuwait m 1952 recommended that consideration should be given to the appointment ot a senior and experienced British Adviser there.('') This proposal was discussed, the Foreign Office favouring the idea of appointing a senior adviser with tne idea o. his becoming a ' Belgrave,'( ') but in view of the unpopularity 01 the term ' Adviser ' it was decided that the Ruler should be pressed to employ a senior British Personal Assistant. In July the Political Resident was accordingly instructed to ask the Ruler (1) to suppress Fahad, who had been giving much trouble to the British experts, (2) to appoint a British Personal Assistant and (3) to delegate authority for taking decisions to the Development Board and the Finance Department^ 21 ) The Ruler asked that these requests should be put into writing, which was done so far as the second and third requests were concerned, it being thought better that a further oral approach should be made regarding the first one. He replied to the written requests to the effect that as things were now proceeding satisfactorily he thought it desirable that the proposals should be kept in abeyance, and averted the oral approach regarding Fahad by complaining about the behaviour of Crichton and Hasted. In August 1953 the Political Resident delivered to the Ruler a letter from the Prime Minister recommending the appointment of a British Adviser but the Ruler politely but firmly refused to consider the appointment at that time. 18. At the end of 1951 Major-General W. F. Hasted, C.B., C.I.E., C.B.E., D.S.O., accepted the appointment of Chief Engineer to the Kuwait Government. He arrived early in the following year and a Development Board was set up in which he and Crichton were the leading spirits. Hasted set to work with great energy and a number of large construction projects were given to British contractors working in partnership with British firms. He also employed a number of British experts on his staff; by the middle of 1952 there were 24 British engineers in Kuwait in Government employ. The Ruler in due course became alarmed at the rate of expenditure and other members of the ruling family were jealous of the position and patronage which Hasted had acquired. Furthermore all the biggest and most profitable works were in the hands of five British contracting firms and their Kuwaiti partners (paragraph 21 below). Hasted allowed himself to be identified with these firms and became the main target of criticism directed against them, and British enterprise in general, by Kuwaitis who had not obtained contracts or what they regarded as their share of development expenditure. This criticism was still vocal at the end of 1953. In May 1952 the Ruler virtually dissolved the Development Board as it then existed by forbidding the directors of departments to attend it.( 25 ) In July he stated that the Development Board was purely technical and advisory and that Fahad as head of the Public Works Department could revise any orders given by Hasted.( 20 ) In December Fahad was made President of the Board and a proposal was made that future construction contracts should be handled on a co-operative basis through a holding company which would replace Hasted's organisation This proposal came to nothing, but in the spring of 1953 a Syrian called Jabri was appointed Chief Engineer and Hasted was informed that his duties were entirely advisory and not executiye.( 27 ) Hasted made many complaints but accepted the position. At the same time it was decided that all future contracts must be put out to tender, and that priority should be given to Kuwaiti firms other than those already working in association with British firms, or mixed comoanies All this led to much ill-feeling between Hasted and Crichton. The former blamed the latter for the instructions that had been issued to him, and the latter the former for refusing to submit to financial control. The British contracting firms voiced their ( 22 ) Para. 14 at p. 6 of Sir R. Makins T Report. ( 23 ) P.O. to P.R. EA 1055/5 G of April 10, 1952.

Her Majesty's Government were alarmed by the state of affairs and especially by the damage which might be caused to sterling by uncontrolled spending at Kuwait and sent out Sir Thomas Rapp to investigate and report on the situation. The Prime Minister also saw the Ruler while he was in London for Her Majesty's Coronation and urged him not to spend his money too fast, not to spend it outside the sterling area, to establish a system of financial control and to employ an expert British Administrator.(' ) Sir Thomas Rapp on his return recommended the up-grading of the post of Political Agent (paragraph 8 above) and that the Economic Counsellor proposed for the Persian Gulf should be stationed at Kuwait. He was satisfied on the whole with the British experts including Crichton and Hasted but stated that the appointment of a Senior Adviser was ' imperative to exercise continuous influence over the Ruler.' He considered it premature to conclude that the prospects of the British contracting firms had been fatally compromised, but thought it expedient to bring pressure on the Ruler to revert to the previous system under which they were working. He was of the opinion that market conditions and the question of British commercial representation required further investigation.C 9 ) Sir Thomas Rapp's recommendations were accepted by the Foreign Office and the instructions issued to the new Political Resident in July 1953 (paragraph 9 above) were based on them. 19. The new Political Resident when he saw the Ruler in August 1953 urged on him not only the importance of appointing a senior administrator but of co-ordinating his various departments and of introducing proper financial control by means of a budgetary system, and received a non-committafreply^ 30 ) A few days later he wrote to the Ruler repeating his advice about the co-ordination of the departments and financial control^ 1 ) and suggesting also the appointment of a single authority over the port of Kuwait, technical advice to the public security authorities on the control of subversive organisations, and the public health control of immigrants, and received another non-committal reply.( 32 ) Fahad raised strong objections to this approach and made many other criticisms of British policy.( 33 ) 20. With Kuwait's rapidly increasing income from oil the question of the disposal of her surplus revenues became a matter of concern to His Majesty's Government. The matter was discussed by the Foreign Office with Kemp, the Ruler's representative in London, who at the beginning of 1951 wrote to the Ruler suggesting the appointment of an Investment Committee in London.( 34 ) There was a further large increase in oil revenues after the conclusion of the fifty-fifty profit- sharing agreement at the end of 1951 and it was estimated that in 1953 they would amount to £60 million. One of the main objects of Sir Roger Makins' visit to the Persian Gulf in February 1952 was to persuade the Ruler to appoint an Investment Committee and he was accompanied for this purpose by a representative of the Treasury and Mr. Loombe from the Bank of England. The Ruler listened attentively to all that was said to him but clearly found it difficult to understand the issues at stake and stated that he wished to consult Kemp before giving a final reply.( 35 ) The matter was discussed with Kemp in London and he sent Her Majesty's Government's proposals to the Ruler in writing. The Ruler still appeared unable to understand them but in October stated that he would accept a plan for dealing with Kuwait's surplus revenues which had been agreed upon by Kemp, Crichton and Loombe.( !(i ) Discussions ensued in London and documents were' prepared embodying Her Majesty's Government's proposals. These were accepted by the Ruler in February 1953.( ) They consisted of a letter which he signed to the effect that he was instructing his Finance Department to inform him from time to time how much of his sterling revenues was likely to be required to meet the needs of the State and that any surplus left over should be made available for investment. The letter was accompanied by a document providing for the establishment of a ( 28 ) (EA 1103/89 of 1953.) C 9 ) B.M.E.O. to P.O. Despatch 20 of June 17, 1953 (EA 1103/96 of 1953).

The first works to be undertaken when substantial revenues from oil started to accrue were a hospital, a water distillation plant, and a huge secondary school. The contract for the distillation plant was given to a British firm and for the school to a Lebanese one. Hasted on his arrival, immediately embarked on an ambitious scheme of town planning and development, and the construction of buildings, including a number of large and expensive schools on lines defined by the Kuwait Education Department, and of roads was immediately taken in hand. Contracts for three years were given at his discretion to five British firms who took a few leading Kuwaiti merchants into partnership on a 15 per cent, above cost-price basis. In 1952 it was decided by the Ruler that all future projects would be put out to tender and that these firms would not be allowed to compete, but at the end of 1953 this decision was modified and the firms were told that they would be allowed to tender for future fixed price contracts, six months before the completion of the work allotted to them, provided they agreed to give up their rights to a minimum amount of work in the third year of their contracts. They were not allowed to tender for the contract for the construction of a port at Kuwait which was under consideration in 1953 and for which a number of firms including many British and foreign firms were competing.( 40 ) Congestion of shipping at Kuwait owing to lack of port facilities after the period of intensive development began caused much inconvenience and delay in the execution of the works. Dredging of a channel to allow ships access to a wharf at Shuwaikh started in 1953. At the end of 1953 work on a brick factory was in progress and a scheme for utilising natural gas in Kuwait was under consideration. 22. Very little potable water is found within the limits of Kuwait State and there is none which can be made available for Kuwait town. The Kuwait Oil Company have drilled many wells but have failed to find any and the efforts of a water diviner who visited Kuwait in 1952 were also unsuccessful. In the past the practice was to bring water by country craft from the Shatt al Arab. In 1933 the Political Agent submitted an interesting report on this source of supply and also on such local sources as were then avail able. ( 4I ) In 1947 a scheme for bringing water by pipe from the Shatt al Arab was mooted, and early the following yearlhe Ruler was warned that it was very unlikely that His Majesty's Government would give any guarantee against interference by the Iraq Government with such a pipe ( 42 ) Later in the year a syndicate of five Kuwaiti and five Iraqi merchants was formed for the promotion of this project and the Ruler was advised to instal a distillation plant before he allowed the scheme to go ahead so that he would have an alternative source of supply if the Iraqis interfered with the pipe.( 43 ) The Ruler ordered a distillation plant in 1949 and Abdullah al Salam in 1950 very shortly ( 38 ) Tel. from Kuwait to P.R. 77 of March 20, 1953 (EA 1 111/50 of 1953) ( 39 ) Tel. from P.O. to Baghdad. 313, Saving, of December 22, 1953 (EA 111 /75 of 1953^ ( 40 ) Kuwait to P.O. 105/28/53 of November 16, 1953 (EA 1111/72 of 1953^) ( 41 ) I.O., to P.O.

Pending its erection the Kuwait Oil Company assisted the town first by bringing water for it from the Shatt al Arab in tankers and later by providing it with water from their own distillation plant. The State distillation plant which was planned to produce 1 million gallons a day began to function early in 1953. In 1952 the Ruler sanctioned the installation of a second plant of the same size. 23. In 1950 a canal was suggested as a possible alternative to a pipe-line from the Shatt al Arab. In 1951 the whole project was discussed with the Ruler again, and he said he had been advised by Nuri Pasha to wait until the distillation plant had been installed.( 44 ) In 1952 when he visited Iraq, Nuri Pasha said that Kuwait could have water from Iraq provided they fetched it. In 1953 the Ruler requested Her Majesty's Government to obtain official confirmation of this from the Iraq Government. An approach was made accordingly and the Iraq Government ' agreed in principle to the proposal relating to the carriage of water from the Shatt al Arab to Kuwait.'( 15 ) The Ruler decided that the project should be financed by his Government and not by a company, and at the end of the year the Development Board appointed Sir Alexander Gibb and Company as consultants for it. 24. A Kuwait Municipality was formed by Shaikh Ahmad in 1930. It consists of a permanent President who is a member of the ruling family (in 1953, Fahad) and a director and eleven members who are elected every two years by a very limited electorate. In 1933 Ahmad added J per cent, to the customs duty to provide funds for the Municipality, but it is now subsidised from the oil revenues. A monthly tax is recovered from shops in the market. The Municipality arranges for scavenging in the town and is consulted about town development. The division of responsibility between it, the Public Works Department and the Development Board is ill-defined but this has no serious consequences as Fahad is head of all three. The Municipality issues ad hoc notices from time to time, but there are no proper bye-laws. 25. Before the grant of an oil concession to the Kuwait Oil Company in 1934 the bulk of the State's revenues was derived from customs. Until 1933 the duty was 4 per cent, ad valorem. In that year it was increased to 4^ per cent, to provide funds for the Kuwait Municipality. In 1936 it was increased to 5 per cent, but remained at 4 per cent, for British merchants. In 1940 it was increased to per cent, and in 1941 to per cent, and on the last occasion the whole duty was made applicable to British subjects (paragraph 5 above). At the end of 1951 when in view of the enormous increase from oil the duty had ceased to be of any importance from the point of view of revenue it was reduced to 4 per cent. In 1951 a British expert arrived to assist in the administration of the Customs Department (paragraph 15 above). He was not suited by temperament to service under the Kuwait Government and succeeded in creating a good deal of opposition to himself. Malpractices were alleged against him, probably unjustly, and in 1952 he resigned. He was not replaced as by this time the importance of the department had greatly decreased. 26. It may be noted here that no duty is charged on alcoholic liquor imported for consumption by persons subject to the Order in Council, the Ruler being of opinion that any such duty would legalise the presence of alchohol in his State. Alcoholic liquor is imported by Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company and distributed by the Political Agent on a permit system as in Bahrain (chapter 2, paragraph 18). The Kuwait Oil Company import their own supplies. An Alcoholic Drinks Regulation^ 6 ) was issued in 1951 to regulate the import, export and disposal of liquor by persons subject to the Order in Council. Although the Ruler has on one occasion complained of the increase in the consumption of alcohol in the State he does not appear to attach as much importance to the matter as the Ruler of Bahrain, and there have not been the same complaints about leakages. 27. In 1929 some kind of mobile force was brought into being to deal with raids, but no attempt appears to have been made to organise a police force before the last war and in 1938 the Ruler was maintaining order through his personal ( 44 ) PR to F.O. 1421/44 of July 21, 1951 (EA 1421/16 of 1951).

In 1952 he was allowed to purchase ten armoured car ^ ^ nd ^1, ?or the of a British officer and three non -commissioned officers were loaned to him for the training of Kuwaitis in their handling. In 1953 he purchase - § carriers. 28. In 1947 Ahmad had stated that he would be asking for the services of a British police expert (paragraph 14 above) but nothing came of this during h _ After Abdullah al Salim had agreed to the appointment of finance and customs experts he was asked also to agree to the appointment ot a police ^pert, but replied that Abdullah al Mubarak should be approached on the subject. The latter relused to agree to the appointment but eventually at the end of 1953 when alarmed at the discovery of something in the nature of a Communist cell accepted the appomtmen of a British Police Officer from the Sudan for the training of his secret police.( ) 29. Abdullah al Mubarak established a party of police under Jabir al Ahmad (paragraph 3 above) at the oil company's camp at Ahmadi. These police functioned in the company's residential but not their industrial areas, where the company maintained their own watchmen or firemen. The company also had their own security staff for the investigation of thefts and other cases. From 1950 onwards a certain amount of friction occurred regarding the division oi responsibilities and at the end of 1952 Abdullah al Mubarak asked the Political Agent to withdraw the powers which had been given to six of the oil company's employees under the Special Police Officers' Regulation^ 49 ) In November 1953 with the concurrence of the Kuwait Oil Company the Political Agent wrote to Abdullah al Mubarak informing him that Her Majesty's Government had no objection in principle to the abolition of the oil company's Investigation Branch and the taking over of its functions by the Kuwait Public Security Department, and suggesting that the British staff of the Branch should be taken over by him. It was stated that the company would wish to continue to employ about 45 men as firemen and gatemen, and that there would be liaison between them and the Police.( 50 ) 30. A separate force of Police numbering about 540 for security and traffic control purposes inside Kuwait town is under the command of Subah, half brother of the present Ruler and of Fahad. He is bitterly jealous of Abdullah al Mubarak and lives in a state of perpetual umbrage because of the superior numbers and equipment of the latter's force. 31. At the opening of the period under review there were many Quranic schools in Kuwait but it does not appear that the State took any interest in education until 1936, when four Palestinian teachers were engaged. In 1938 there were three boys' and one girl's school maintained by the Kuwait Government. The boys' schools imparted a form of secondary education and there were, in addition, a number of Quranic and private preparatory schools. The Political Agent reported that every boy and nearly every girl went to a school of some kind. In 1942 the education portfolio was given to Abdullah al Jabir (paragraph 3 above), who was assisted by a committee. In this year the Palestinian teachers were replaced by Egyptians, the latter being supplied by the Egyptian Government who paid half their salaries. By 1944 there were 12 boys' and two girls' schools ( 47 ) I.O. toF.O. P. 1341 of March 21, 1928 (E 1517/1517/91 of 1928).

In 1946 these numbered 57. From this time onwards education made rapid progress in Kuwait though as in Bahrain (Chapter 2, paragraph 26) the higher secondary classes were poorly attended and there was little demand for advanced education. The local authorities welcomed occasional visits from the British Council representative at Basra but attempts which were made from time to time to persuade them to employ British teachers for the teaching of English all failed. 32. In 1950 the Kuwait Government dispensed with the services of the Egyptian Director of Education and teachers and employed Palestinians instead. They also decided not to send more students to Cairo and to allow their hostel there to die a natural death. In 1952 an Egyptian Educational Mission was back again, but a Kuwaiti who had previously been in charge of the hostel at Cairo was made Director of Education with the previous Palestinian Director as his adviser. From 1949 onwards very large sums of money were devoted to the building of new schools (paragraph 21 above) and it became the policy of the State to provide free education with every possible amenity, including free meals for all. The new secondary school which is being built on an enormous scale is reported to be designed in due course to become a university. 33. In 1953 there were over 50 Kuwaiti boys studying in the United Kingdom for whose welfare the Ruler has made Kemp responsible. The latter is primarily the Ruler's representative in London under his agreements with the Kuwait Oil CompanyC 1 ) and the American Independent Oil Company but has developed into a general Kuwait agent and, amongst other things, deals with the recruitment of British staff for the Kuwait Government.C') For dealing with the students he employs an organisation which styles itself International Education. He is unwilling to co-operate with the British Council and the Foreign Office are not satisfied with the arangements he makes for the students.( 53 ) In 1953 there was trouble over three paternity cases. These cases also caused embarrassment in Kuwait as although the students are willing to marry the girls concerned, the Ruler will not allow them to bring British wives back to Kuwait. 34. The rapid spread of education in Kuwait and the employment of a large number of teachers from Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East have been matters of concern to Her Majesty's Government, who fear the spread of subversive ideas and the emergence of a class of political agitators. To counteract subversive influences efforts have been made as already stated (paragraph 31 above) to persuade the Kuwait Government to employ some British teachers, and a proposal is under consideration to establish a British Institute at Kuwait. The Kuwait Government have refused to employ British teachers on the grounds that only the Egyptians produce examinations in Arabic recognised by the Arab world and that they have made supervision of education by qualified Egyptian teachers a condition for allowing Kuwaitis to enter universities in Egypt.( 54 ) It was not known at the end of 1953 whether funds would be forthcoming for the establish ment of a British Institute nor had the Ruler been formally consulted on the subject. The Kuwait Oil Company had, however, been asked whether they would be willing to contribute to its cost.( 5i ') 35. Justice in Kuwait is administered, at any rate in theory, according to Muhammadan Law, but there appears to be no proper organisation of the Courts. Abdullah al Jabir (paragraph 3 above) presides over a High Court which deals with commercial cases by delegating them to a Commercial Committee (Majlis al Tujjar). Cases of personal status and of murder and manslaughter are dealt with by the Shara' Court over which an Egyptian Qadhi presides. Other criminal cases are handled by the Police, i.e., by Subah al Salim in the town and by Abdullah al Mubarak outside it. No codes appear to be followed in these cases and justice is administered arbitrarily. Floggings are common but no case of the cutting olf of a hand for theft has been reported. Some Kuwaitis are beginning to complain at the absence of organised justice but do not dare to make their views known to those in authority. ( 51 ) I.O. to F.O.

Although in 1952 he consulted the ^ouUhe law of liability/') he has, generally speaking, refused to accept any advice about the drafting of his laws. In 1953, when draft Traffic Regulations were presented for his approval, he rejected them in favour of a draft which was being prepared by his own people. He has further refused to accept a proposal for a joint cour to try cases in which both his subjects and persons subject to the Order-m-Council are involved. In judicial and legislative, as well as in educational matters, the Ruler and his family appear anxious to preserve their independence and exclude British interference. III.—The Neutral Zone 37 The Neutral Zone was defined in the Kuwait-Najd Boundary Convention of 1922( 59 ) in which it was stated that in the territory concerned the Governments of Najd and Kuwait will share equal rights until through the good oltices ot the Government of Great Britain a further agreement is made between Najd and Kuwait concerning it.' 1 Sir Percy Cox reported that the reason for the creation ol this Zone was that a rumour had been started that signs ol oil had been noticed in the neighbourhood of Khor Maqta, and that he did not feel able to agree to the allocation of the territory to either party until the rumour had been set at rest.( ) Although Shaikh Ahmad accepted the Boundary Convention he looked upon the Zone as his by right and for long hoped that it would revert to him on Ibn Saud's death. It was largely on this account that in 1934, when a Saudi official suggested a geographical partition of the Zone, the Political Agent strongly recommended that the suggestion should not be passed on to the Ruler for fear of incurring his resentment( 61 ) and it was accordingly not pursued. In 1940 after the terms of a Trade Agreement between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had been settled (paragraph 144 below) the Saudis wished to establish a customs post at Wafrah in the Zone. His Majesty's Government supported the Ruler's objections to this proposaK 62 ) and it was not proceeded with. It was not until 1946, when he perhaps realised that Ibn Saud was likely to outlive him, that Ahmad abandoned his hope of obtaining possession of the whole of the Zone and announced his willingness to grant an oil concession for his undivided share of it. 38. In 1952 in correspondence about the islands lying of[ the Neutral Zone the Saudi Arabian Government stated that they considered that the Neutral Zone and all pertaining to it was held in partnership between them and Kuwait and that both had equal rights. They therefore requested that Kuwait should not take any unilateral action in the Zone.C 13 ) In replying to this Her Majesty's Government pointed out that in the absence of any agreement specifying the way in which the equal rights should be exercised both Governments had necessarily acted unilaterally in such matters as the granting of oil concessions, but that it was their view that no such unilateral action could affect the equal rights which the two Governments shared.( fil ) 39. The territory is waterless and ordinarily uninhabited and no political question of importance arose regarding it until the Ruler of Kuwat and Ibn Saud granted concessions to oil companies for their undivided shares in it in 1948 and 1949 respectively. While negotiations for a concession were in progress at Kuwait the possibility of the geographical division of the Zone between the two countries ( 56 ) F.O. to P.R.

Despatch 118 of October 20, 1952 (EA 1087/24 of 1952).69 was considered by His Majesty's Government but it was decided that the matter must rest until the negotiations were completed. 40. The grant of the concessions raised the questions of the future administration of the territory, of the exercise of jurisdiction within its limits and of the demarcation of its boundaries. The two latter questions are dealt with elsewhere (paragraphs 172 and 53-56 below). Various suggestions were made about the administration of the Zone. In 1949 Ibn Saud wrote to the Ruler suggesting the setting up of an Administrative Council composed of two delegates from each Government, the senior delegate of each Government to preside in turn.( 6 ') The Ruler replied suggesting that the matter should be postponed until the results of the oil companies' explorations were known.( 6G ) Abdullah al Salim immediately before his accession in January 1950 expressed the opinion that the Saudis should take over entire responsibility for the administration of the Zone and that Kuwait should rest content with taking her share of the profits. He repeated this suggestion after his accession but subsequently stated that he left in entirely to His Majesty's Government to settle the matter and made it clear that his chief anxiety was to avoid friction with Ibn Saud.( 67 ) His Majesty's Government at this time, although they would have preferred partition, considered it impracticable and favoured a modified form of the joint Administrative Council proposed by Ibn Saud.( 68 ) Various other suggestions were considered including one for partition for administrative purposes and one which was advanced by the American Independent Oil Company that the Ruler of Kuwait and Ibn Saud should each exercise authority over his own nationals and concessionaries, matters involving both being dealt with by a joint tribunal, but as for a long time no oil was found and nothing occurred in the Zone calling for administrative action, and as the Saudis did not raise the question again, it was decided to let the whole matter rest.( 69 ) 41. In July 1953 Her Majesty's Government formulated a fresh scheme for the administration of the Zone based on the proposals put forward by Ibn Saud to the Ruler of Kuwait in 1949 and suggestions made by Mr. Peyton, the Pacific Western Oil Corporation's representative at Jedda.( 70 ) The administration was to be carried out by a neutral Agent assisted by an Advisory Commission of four members, two from Saudi Arabia and two from Kuwait. The Saudis were to exercise jurisdiction over their own nationals and concessionaries and over the nationals of certain neutral Muslim States, and the Ruler, or when appropriate Her Majesty, over Kuwait nationals and concessionaries and nationals of other neutral States. Joint Courts were to be set up for mixed cases. The Political Resident and Her Majesty's Ambassador at Jedda concurred in the scheme. It was not explained to the Ruler of Kuwait but the Political Agent thought he would probably accept it.( 71 ) He had previously shown himself opposed to joint administration and seemed to favour a scheme whereby the Zone would be administered by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in alternate years, which appears to have been his interpretation of the proposals made by Ibn Saud to his predecessor in 1949.( 72 ) As however the American Independent Oil Company and the Pacific Western Oil Corporation, in spite of the fact that oil had been struck, came to an agreement that the former should continue to operate on behalf of both companies,( 73 ) there appeared no urgency to make any special arrangements for the administration of the Zone and no approach had been made to the Saudis on the basis of the scheme by the end of 1953. 42. In December 1953 when the Ruler of Kuwait paid a visit to King Saud to offer condolences on his father's death the following arrangement was arrived at between them: 'Having taken note of the agreement reached between the P 0 ! American Independent Oil Company and the Pacific Western Oil Company on the export through Kuwait of oil for the Neutral Zone, the King and the Ruler decided that, if it proved necessary, they would appoint ad hoc officials to discuss the affairs of the Neutral Zone.'( 74 ) The attitude to be adopted by Her Majesty's Government towards this development had not been decided by the end of 1953.

In 1932 the following definition of Kuwait -Iraq in accordance with that contained ^ n t ^f ffiHaiiv recosnised by His of 1913,( 75 ) and Kuwait's claim to which had b f n J {Zl Majesty's Government in 1923, was accepted by both w^Hi el Audia with and the Ruler of Kuwaiti 76 )—' From the intersection nf t he iati^de the Batin and thence northwards along the Batin to a point 1 ust and of Safwan; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan w ^ 1 . 1 ?' with Um Qasr leaving them to Iraq and so on to the junction of the Khor Zube r wit the Khor Abdullah.'( 77 ) In spite of this in 1938 in an aide-memoire handed to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at Geneva the Iraqi Government claimed that since they were the successors of the Turkish Government in the Basra villayet, Kuwait ought to be incorporated in Iraq. Alternatively they urged that the northern frontier of Kuwait should run from west to east at about Lat. 29 J j N. instead of about 30° N. to make it easier to prevent smuggling. 44. Some doubts arose about the correct interpretation ol the accepted definition and in 1936 it was suggested to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad that he should obtain the Iraqi Government's concurrence in a line it was proposed to show on a War Office map.( 78 ) The Ambassador did not think it politic to do this and the map was printed without the concurrence of the Iraqi Government in the line which was shown on it. 45. In March 1939 His Majesty's Government instructed His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad to endeavour to arrange with the Iraqi Government for the early demarcation of the frontier between Kuwait and Iraq. This had been rendered desirable by repeated frontier incidents and by the activities of oil companies in both territories. The Iraqi Government had also begun to talk of the possibility of developing a port in the vicinity of Umm Qasr. His Majesty's Ambassador accordingly prepared a draft exchange of notes on the subject containing amongst other things a proposed interpretation of various points in the definition of the frontier which required clarification^ 7 ') Much discussion ensued between the various authorities concerned on the side of His Majesty's Government and it was not until October 1940 that the note (Appendix D(i))was finally delivered to the Iraqi Government^ 80 ) In addition to clarifying the definition of 1932 the note contained a new proposal, viz., that from the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah to the open sea the boundary should follow the thalweg of the Khor Abdullah. The Iraqi Government replied that they took the proposals in the Embassy's note as having been inspired by the discussion of the Iraq-Saudi frontier question and that as that question had been put off for the present they considered it convenient that discussion of the proposals made in the Embassy's note should also be put off. His Majesty's Ambassador ascertained privately that the Iraqi Ministry of Defence had deprecated the demarcation of the frontier until the question of the cession to Iraq of the islands of Warbah and Bubiyan had been settled (paragraph 59 below). The previous approval of the Ruler of Kuwait had been obtained to the interpretation of the definition which was embodied in the note to the Iraqi Government^ 81 ) The Ambassador returned to the charge with the Iraqis early in 1941 but they replied that in their opinion the settlement of other questions concerning Kuwait {i.e., smuggling from Kuwait and the cession of Kuwait territory to Iraq to secure Iraqi control of approaches to the proposed port near Umm Qasr) should precede the demarcation of the frontier.( 82 ) 46.

The Ambassador had suggested that this should be the ' point situated one mile due south of the most southerly palm of Safwan.' The Political Resident objected that this would be south of a board which had long marked the frontier and in the note presented to the Iraqi Government the definition proposed was the ' point a little to the south of Safwan at which the post and notice-board marking the frontier stood until March 1939.' The board was originally placed in position by the Ruler of Kuwait and the Political Agent about 1923.( S! ) It was removed by the Iraqis in 1932. On a protest being made they stated that they had removed it to get it repainted, and replaced it. it was removed again by persons unknown in March 1939. In June 1940 the Political Agent had it replaced again in the presence of an Iraqi frontier official. The Iraqis protested that their frontier had been violated up to a point 1,000 metres from Safwan post and that the new board had been erected at a point far from the site of the old one at a distance of 250 metres within the Iraqi frontier^ 84 ) They removed it and it has not since been replaced. They were informed that the Kuwaiti authorities were satisfied that the new board had been put up on its original site and that the allegation that it had been re-erected at a point 250 metres within Iraqi territory could not be accepted.( So ) It is no longer possible to determine exactly where the original board stood, but in September 1940 the Political Resident reported that with Colonel Dickson's assistance it had been ascertained that it was situated about 1,050 yards south of the most southerly palm of Safwan.( ?6 ) 47. Towards the end of 1941 the military authorities decided to develop a port near Umm Qasr. This led to a further examination of the frontier question and the Political Resident urged that in accordance with the correct reading of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 the frontier should not run in a direct line from the point south of Safwan to the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah, as proposed in the note presented to the Iraqi Government in 1940, but that it should run in a direct line to a point immediately south of Umm Qasr and then turn south-east to the junction of the Khors.( 87 ) Though only a small wedge of territory was involved a portion of it lay in the area which was being developed as a port. It was generally agreed that the interpretation of the definition of the frontier accepted by the Ruler of Kuwait and presented to the Iraqi Government probably erred somewhat in favour of the latter so far as this particular point was concerned but the Foreign Office were of opinion that it was impossible to go back on it. The Indian Office refused to accept this view and it was decided to leave the matter unresolved until after the war. In a long note prepared by Mr. Wakefield,( 88 ) an officer of the Indian Political Service on special duty at Kuwait, it was also argued that junction of the two Khors lay about two miles north of the point which had previously been accepted but his view on this matter found little support. Early in 1942 His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad and the Political Resident visited Umm Qasr together and although their opinions differed about the exact line of the frontier they were both agreed that the port would lie partly in Iraq and partly in Kuwait territory and that it should be administered entirely by the military authorities for the duration of the war.( 89 ) Arrangements were made accordingly and the Iraqi Prime Minister was informed of them orally but in spite of this in June 1942 a notification appeared in the Iraq Government Gazette containing a schedule of dues and charges to be charged at the port of Umm Qasr.( 90 ) The Government of India and the Political Resident raised strong objections to this notification and His Majesty's Ambassador asked the Iraqi Prime Minister orally to cancel part of it. The Prime Minister refused to agree and His Majesty's Embassy addressed a note to the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs in which it was stated that in view of the notification which had been issued His Majesty's Government thought it well ' formally to notify the Iraqi Government that nothing that is done or has been done with regard to the port of Umm Qasr can be held in any way to prejudice the question of where the frontier lies.'( 91 ) ( 83 ) I.O. to F.O.

It is unlikely that the development ol an Iraqi port at Umm Qasr could adversely affect Kuwait's of her enormous oil resources, and in 1951 the present R uler that he saw no objection to the development of such a port piovided there was no infringement of Kuwait territory.( 93 ) 49. After 1942 the frontier question remained dormant until 1946, when the Political Resident reported considerable agricultural development south ot Safwan.O Tn 1947 His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad recommended the early delimitation of the frontier and discussion between the British authorities concerned was resumed and continued for several years. It was eventually decided that the Ruler should be shown on a large-scale map the line which had been proposed to the Iraqis in 1940 and asked to agree to a further approach being made to them on the basis of the same line. This was done after the accession of the present Ruler in 1950 and he asreed to the proposaU 95 ) He did, however, insist that the key point ' to the south of Safwan ' was less than a mile away from that place.C ) In^ 1948 the Acting Iraqi Minister informed His Majesty's Ambassador orally that he would shortly be receiving a note opening the whole question of the Iraqi- Kuwait frontier( 97 ) but nothing further transpired. 50. In April 1951 the Kuwait Oil Company were informed that there was no objection to their operating up to a distance of 3^ kilometres from the frontier as shown on War Office map No. 3954.( 9S ) 51. In 1951 there was much further discussion about the point south of Safwan and it was decided to define it as the point 1,000 metres due south of the customs post at Safwan, i.e., the building which, on the 25th June, 1940, was used as the customs post at Safwan '(') This definition was embodied in a note which was presented to the Iraqi Government in December 1951 (Appendix D (ii)), the interpretation of the 1932 line being otherwise much the same as that proposed in the note of 1940 (paragraph 45 above). The Ruler had agreed to an approach being made to the Iraqis on the lines proposed^ 100 ) though it is not clear that the new definition of the point south of Safwan was explained to him, and to bear half the cost of a Joint Technical Commission suggested in the note. The Iraqi Government replied in May 1952 asking that, in view of their desire to construct a port at Umm Qasr, the question of the cession to them of Warbah island should be settled before demarcation of the frontier was undertaken.( 101 ) They alleged that in 1938 Lord Halifax had agreed orally to include this island in Iraq on the basis of giving compensation to Kuwait, and that he had promised that a note would be addressed to the Iraqi Government in confirmation of this. The Iraqi Ambassador made a similar allegation in a note addressed to the Foreign Office in June 1952.( 102 ) In both cases a reply was given to the effect that there was nothing on record to indicate any agreement on the part of Her Majesty's Government to the transfer of the island of Warbah to Iraq, and that at the meeting which took place between Foreign Office officials and Iraqi Foreign Minister in 1938 it had only been suggested that if the Iraqi Government wished the Ruler of Kuwait to cede to them a part of his territory they should make proposals to him with an offer of compensation. This did not imply that Her Majest3/'s Government agreed to the cession of Warbah to Iraq. C') I.O. to F.O. Ext. 2004/42 of April 28, 1942 (E 2656/134/93 of 1942).

In June 1953 an official of the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed Her Majesty's Embassy that the Iraqis had given up their idea of requesting the cession of Warbah and Bubiyan and he was accordingly asked whether the demarcation of the frontier could not be proceeded with.( 10;! ) He promised to discuss the matter with his Ministry but nothing further was heard on the subject in spite of frequent reminders and it appeared that the Iraqis were unable to make up their minds whether to proceed with the Umm Qasr scheme or not, but that, should they decide to do so, they would probably ask for the cession of Warbah or Bubiyan or both.( 104 ) A Committee had been appointed to examine the question but had not met by December 1953. In that month, when the Iraqi Government complained officially about some alleged Kuwaiti violations of the frontier. Her Majesty's Embassy called attention to the absence of any definitive answer to their note of December 195i.( 105 ) Ever since 1940 the Iraqis have been finding excuses for refusing to agree to proposals which have from time to time been made to them for the demarcation of the frontier, and it seems likely that they are avoiding the issue in the hope that one day the absorption of Kuwait by Iraq will remove the necessity for any such demarcation (paragraph 118 below). {b) With Saudi Arabia and the Neutral Zone, and between the Neutral Zone and Saudi Arabia 53. The following is the definition of the southern boundary of Kuwait in the Kuwait-Najd Boundary Convention of 1922.( 106 ) ' The frontier between Najd and Kuwait begins in the West from the junction of the Wadi al Aujah with the Batin, leaving Raqi to Najd, from this point it continues in a straight line until it joins latitude 29° and the red semi-circle referred to in Article 5 of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of July 29, 1913. The line then follows the side of the red semi-circle until it reaches a point terminating on the coast south of Ras al Qaliah.' The red semi-circle mentioned is described in the Anglo-Turkish Convention^ 07 ) as having the town of Kuwait at its centre, the Khor Zubair at its northern extremity and Qrain at its southern extremity. 54. The boundary has never been demarcated and no question arose regarding it until 1948 when in view of the grant of a concession for the Neutral Zone to the American Independent Oil Company the Kuwait Oil Company called attention to the fact that two Qrains were marked on War Office map No. 3954 of 1936, one a hill and the other a group of wells about two miles to the south of it and enquired which of them marked the southern frontier of Kuwait.( 108 ) No definite reply could be given to this question pending demarcation^ 09 ) but it may be noted that the boundary shown on the War Office map referred to appears to run through the hill, while on the map referred in the Kuwait-Najd Boundary Convention Qrain is shown south of the boundary. 55. In December 1948 the Ruler pressed for the demarcation of this boundary. At the end of the year a despatch was drafted to His Majesty's Ambassador at Jedda asking him to endeavour to obtain the Saudi Arabian Government's acceptance of a line which showed the Qrain wells as lying within Kuwait territory on the basis of an examination of the case which had been undertaken by Professor Mason. The despatch was forwarded to the Political Resident for his comments( 110 ) and the Ruler agreed to the terms of the approach it was proposed to make to the Saudis and undertook to erect theboundarypillars.C 11 ) The despatch, however, did not issue as the proposed approach to the Saudis would inevitably raise the question of the administration of the Zone, a matter which it had been decided to leave dormant for the time being( 112 ) (paragraph 40 above). In February 1951 a Saudi official mentioned informally to His Majesty's Ambassador at Jedda that the concessionary companies were anxious to have the northern boundary of the Neutral Zone accurately demarcated but the matter ( ios ) Baghdad to P.O. 1592/3/1953 of June 15, 1953 (EA 1083/37 of 1953).

Later in 1951 the local manager of the American Independent Oil Company suggested that the oil companies should try to reach an agreement amongst themselves regarding the position of the Kuwait-Neutral Zone Boundary. His Majesty's Government agreed to this proposal but refused to give any guarantee that they or the Saudis would accept any decision t a mig he reached.( n3 ) In the event no discussions between the oil companies took place partly because the Kuwait Oil Company refused to participate. Wh er! ^ 1S wa s reported Her Majesty's Embassy at Jedda was instructed to make the approach contemplated in 1949. Action was however defened pending the ciscussion of other matters with the SaudisC') and no approach had been made to them by the end of 1953. 56. In 1951 it was decided that any approach to the Saudis on the demarcation of the boundaries between {a) Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and ib) the Neutral Zone and Saudi Arabia which are defined in the Kuwait Najd Boundary Convention must await the exact delimitation ot the boundary between Kuwait and the Neutral Zone.C^') V—Islands, Territorial Waters and Sea-bed {a) Islands 57. The Kuwait islands fall into two groups, viz. (A) those which have been formally recognised by Her Majesty's Government and by the Iraqi Government as belonging to Kuwait and (B) those which have been or may be claimed by or on behalf of Kuwait but have not yet been formally recognised as belonging to her. Group A 58. The Ruler was informed in 1923 that His Majesty's Government recognised his claim to Warbah, Bubiyan, Maskan (or Mashjan), Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru and Umm al Maradim, and the Iraqi Prime Minister agreed in 1932 (paragraph 43 above) that these islands appertained to Kuwait.( 116 ) Only the first two and the last three have any history during the period under review. Warbah and BubiyanC 1 ') 59. There are uninhabited mud flats lying on the western side of the mouth of the Shatt al Arab. In 1938 the Iraqi Foreign Minister while on a visit to London raised the question of the cession of Warbah in order to give Iraq control of the approaches to the proposed port at Umm Qasr (paragraphs 47-48 above) and since then the Iraqi Government whenever approached on the subject of the demarcation of the land frontier have raised the question of the cession of Warbah or Bubiyan or both and they appear to be unwilling to proceed with such demarcation unless such cession is first agreed. In 1940 the Ruler expressed strong objections to any such cession. In 1948 the acting Iraqi Prime Minister informed His Majesty's Ambassador that Iraq would be laying claim to the island of Warbah( 118 ) but no such claim was received. In June 1953 it appeared the Iraqis had given up the idea of pressing for the cession of one or both of the islands but at the end of the year Her Majesty's Embassy at Bagdad thought it possible that the Iraqis might'ask for Warbah Island m exchange for supplying water to Kuwait.( 119 ) It does not appear that the Iraqis have ever seriously attempted to maintain a territorial claim to the islands but only that they have been anxious to obtain their cession by negotiation. As already stated (paragraph 5 above) under the Bandar Shuwaikh Agreement (Appendix A (i) and (ii)) Her Majesty's Government have a right of pre-emption over Warbah island. ( 1J3 ) F.O. to P.R.

These islands were not specifically mentioned in the Kuwait Oil Company's concession and when the Ruler granted a concession for his share of the Neutral Zone to the American Independent Oil Company in 1948 the latter claimed that these islands were included in it. Both the Ruler and the company were warned that the islands were part of Kuwait proper and were not and never had been part of the Neutral Zone, and the Ruler then granted a separate concession for them to the latter company (paragraph 111 below). 61. In 1946 the Ruler agreed in writing to the erection of a lighthouse on Kubbar,( 121 ) and the lighthouse was erected in the same year. 62. In April 1952 the Saudi Arabian Government possibly at the instance of the Pacific Western Oil Corporation who held the concession for their share of the Neutral Zone sent a note to Her Majesty's Embassy at Jedda claiming equal rights with Kuwait in the islands of Qaru and Umm al Maradim on the grounds that they were opposite the coast of the Neutral Zone and therefore appertained to iU 122 ) They stated that they intended to inform their concessionary oil company accordingly. Her Majesty's Ambassador replied that Her Majesty's Government could not entertain any suggestion that the two islands were part of the Neutral Zone or that the Saudi Arabian Government could have any claim to them.( 12:: ) In September the Saudis sent another note reaffirming their claim. Her Majesty's Ambassador replied in more detail asserting that the islands with their territorial waters, sea-bed and subsoil belonged to Kuwait and pointing out that in the Kuwait-Nejd Boundary Convention of 1922( 124 ) no islands are included in the Neutral Zone and that the Zone is defined as being bounded in the east by the sea.( 125 ) This note was delivered in November 1952 since when nothing further has been heard from the Saudis on the subject. In April 1953 Her Majesty's Ambassador at Jedda gave it as his opinion that their claim was not dead and reported that a representative of the Pacific Western Oil Company had stated that if the American Independent Oil Company attempted to exploit the two islands his company would break them.( 126 ) In December 1953 the Political Agent informed the Ruler in writing that there was no objection to his treating the islands as his own and authorising the American Independent Oil Company to operate on them, but that Her Majesty's Government could not guarantee that there would be no revival of the Saudi claim or guarantee Kuwait or the company against loss.( 127 ) Group B 63. This consists of the following islands;—Farsi, Arabi, Harqus, Qran, Qraiyn, Janah, Jaraid and Maqta. All were claimed for Kuwait in a statement prepared at the Political Agency in 1951 and somewhat vaguely accepted by the Ruler,( 128 ) In the same year a detailed memorandum was prepared in the Political Residency analysing Kuwait's claim to the islands for the purpose of proposed discussions with the Saudi Arabian Government.( 12 ') All the islands in the group were claimed for Kuwait in an aide-memoire presented to the Saudi Arabian Government in April 1951. In the discussions with the Amir Faisal in London in August His Majesty's Government proposed that Kuwait should relinquish her claim to the other islands on condition that the Saudi Arabian Government should recognise Farsi as belonging to her.( 13n ) The Amir promised to lay this proposal before Ibn Saud (Appendix E). Owing to the preoccupation of both Governments with affairs on the south-eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia no further progress had been made in the settlement of the dispute by the end of 1953.

Until 1936 the status of Farsi and also of Arabi and Harqus was regarded as indeterminate. Beacons were erected on f^em by the Governm i a with the approval of His Majesty's Government in 1914.( J n • f ' , representative of an oil company began to show interest m es^ is ai , e political authorities in the Persian Gulf recommended that they s ou j f e annexed by His Majesty's Government or that the Ruler should be encouraged to plant his flag on them.r 5 ) When enquiries from the Ruler were made about their ownership, he claimed Farsi and Arabi without hesitation but had never eard of Harqus.( 134 ) He later stated in support of his claim that within the memory of man Kuwait pearlers and fishermen had been the sole users ot the two islands lor careening their vessels and for fishing.C ') There was much departmental discussion about the action to be taken regarding the islands. It was agreed that it was impossible for His Majesty's Government to annex them and that it was undesirable that the Ruler should plant his flag on them. A proposal that he should be encouraged to strengthen his claim by some less obtrusive method and that at the same time he should be warned that His Majesty s Govei nment would not be able to support his claim should another country produce a better one found some favour( 136 ) but no orders were issued and no action was taken. 65. There were no further developments until 1945 when the Government of India referred to the Political Resident a proposal to erect a light on Farsi. The Ruler was consulted and agreed in writing to the proposal. No action was taken at the time and in the latter half of 1946 the Political Resident referred to His Majesty's Government the proposal to erect a light beacon on Farsi and, in ignorance of the previous approach to the Ruler, suggested that his consent should be obtained in writing and that at the same time he should be warned orally that his claim to the island could not be supported if another country produced a better one. The Ruler again agreed in writing to the erection of the beacon and was given an oral warning on the lines proposed.( 137 ) Even before work on this beacon started the Saudis got wind of it and protested.( 138 ) They were informed orally that steps had been taken to replace the unlighted beacon, which had been erected by His Majesty's Government on Farsi in 1914, by a lighted beacon in order to meet the requirements of shipping and that His Majesty's Government had for long regarded the island as belonging to Kuwait and had been unaware that the Saudis claimed it.( 139 ) The Saudis returned to the charge, claiming the island on the grounds of propinquity. The Ruler of Kuwait was asked whether he wished his claim to the island to be supported as against the Saudis and replied in the affirmative.( 140 ) In May 1949 as it had been reported that the Saudi Arabian Government intended to proclaim their sovereignty over Farsi and other islands in the group, when they issued their declaration about the sea-bed. His Majesty's Embassy addressed a note to them mentioning this report and suggesting that as Kuwait also claimed some or all of the islands no proclamation of sovereignty should be made pending discussion of the respective claims of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.( 141 ) 66. Towards the end of 1948 the Persians heard a rumour that the Ruler of Kuwait was trying to interest certain oil companies in Farsi and neighbouring islands and made informal enquiries on the subject. In December a tin plate was found on Farsi bearing the words ' Persian Soil' in Persian and similar inscriptions were found on the beacon.( li2 ) In March 1949 His Majesty's Embassy at Teheran addressed a note to the Persian Government stating that His Majesty's Government considered that the island belonged to Kuwait and in consonance with this view had performed various actions on it in the past.

The plate was removed at the end of May by one of His Majesty's Ships. Since then there is no record of any further Persian interference on the island. The Ruler of Kuwait was informed of the action taken and in June erected a plate on the island bearing the inscription ' Kuwait.'( 145 ) This plate is presumed to have been removed by the Saudis when they erected their own marker there at the end of 1949. 67. In 1949 the Bahrain Petroleum Company wished to erect an electronic survey aid station on Farsi.( 146 ) It was at first agreed that they might do so but subsequently in view of Persian and Saudi daims to the island they were persuaded to use Arabi instead. 68. In December 1949 a concrete plinth was found on the island with brass plates embedded in it with inscriptions to the effect that the island belonged to Saudi Arabia. His Majesty's Ambassador at Jedda addressed a note to the Saudi Arabian Government expressing surprise at this action and threatening to remove the marker unless they stated the basis for their claim.( 147 ) A reply was received that the Saudi Arabian Government were willing to discuss the matter( 148 ) and action to remove the marker was for a time suspended. In May it was discovered that a Saudi marker had also been erected on Arabi probably about three months previously and that plaques had been placed on beacons marking the channel to Ras Tanura (Chapter 2, paragraph 52). In view of this it was decided to remove all the markers and plaques and those on Farsi and Arabi were demolished by one of His Majesty's Ships in August. An aide-memoire was simultaneously presented to the Saudi Arabian Government informing them of the action that was being taken and stating that His Majesty's Government were still willing to enter into discussions.( l49 ) A series of strong protests from the Saudi Arabian Government followed but they ended up by asking that no markers should be erected on the disputed islands and shoals by the Rulers under His Majesty's Government's protection,( 130 ) a proposal which was readily accepted. The Ruler of Kuwait was informed of the action before it was taken and after referring to the strength of the Saudis said he left everything in the hands of His Majesty's Government. At the same time as the aide-memoire about the markers, another aide-memoire was addressed to the Saudi Arabian Government suggesting that each Government should prepare a ' Memorandum of Claims ' setting out the detailed evidence on which its claims to the islands of Farsi, Arabi and Bainah (belonging to Bahrain) were based. The course of the subsequent negotiations has already been described (paragraph 63 above and Chapter 2, paragraphs 54-56). 69. Early in 1949 the Persian Gulf Lighting Service decided to install a new light on Farsi and the Ruler was informed accordingly, but the project was held up for a long time for fear of creating political complications with the Saudis. Eventually in July 1951 the latter informed His Majesty's Government that they intended to erect six lights to mark the channels leading to Ras Tanurah and they , affirmed that should the Bahrain Government have any claims to ownership of some of the points concerned the installation of lights on them would not be taken as an added claim to the ownership of these points by the Saudi Arabian Government 15 ') (Chapter 2, paragraph 57). The opportunity was at once taken to seek the concurrence of the Saudi Arabian Government in the erection of a new light on Farsi on similar terms, and in January 1952 that Government agreed to its installation without prejudice to the determination of sovereignty over the island in the future.( 152 ) A new light was installed accordingly.

The Ruler of Kuwait claimed this island in 1936 'P ar h agr ^ ° t V of A beacon had been erected on it in 1914 under theorders , , , India, In 1946 the Political Resident proposed that th ' s ^con and also the beacon on Harqus, should be renewed after obtaining the Ru'er s c&lt; ?' s ^ * ™ Majesty's Government agreed but no action was taken b ^' s , e f he G p^'7ttee of India at the instance of the Persian Gulf Lighting Servl ^/^y^ refused to sanction the work. In 1949 the Ruler was ask e renlied in the his claim to the island to be supported as against Saudi Arabia and replied m the affirmative^ 154 ) The island was mentioned in the note addressed Arabian Government in May 1949 (paragraph 65 above). 71. In 1949 the Bahrain Petroleum Company erected an electronic aid survey station on Arabi after objections had been raised to their use of Farsi ort is purpose (paragraph 67 above). They stated that they were not seeking to establish any mineral or other rights and that their action should be regarded as wi out preiudice to any claim to sovereignty over the island. They reiused to approach the Ruler of Kuwait but the Political Agent informed him of their intentions and he raised no objection.C 0 ') The station was established in Septentber and in the following month the company reported that they had received a strong protest from the Arabian American Oil Company who stated that the Amir of Hasa had asked Ibn Saud for permission to occupy the island by force. The company had accordingly withdrawn all their personnel from the island. T hey later reported that just before this withdrawal a party of eight armed Saudi coastguards had visited the island and taken particulars of their personnel and installations. At the beginning of November the Saudi Arabian Government handed to His Majesty's Ambassador at Jedda a letter addressed to the Ruler of Bahrain protesting against the company's action on Arabi and Fasht Bu Sa'afah (Chapter 2, paragraph 51) and claiming that the island and shoal belonged to Saudi Arabia.C 0 ') The Saudi Arabian Government also in replying to an aide-memoire received from His Majesty's Ambassador expressed their readiness to negotiate about Arabi and other islands and shoals and asked that in the meanwhile the Bahrain Petroleum Company's operations on Arabi should cease.( 157 ) The company received a letter on the subject direct from the Amir of Hasa, and replied that they had no interest in the minerals on the island and that they required three weeks to move their installations. They removed them accordingly. The Ruler of Kuwait was informed by the Political Agent of the position and replied that he would abide by His Majesty's Government's decision. Ibn Saud on being informed that the island was claimed for Kuwait and not Bahrain wrote a personal letter to Ahmad on the subject, but it could not be delivered to the latter before his death and Ibn Saud then stated that it had no significance and no reply was sent to it. In April 1950 a reply was sent to the Saudi Arabian Government's note of the previous November asking them to state the basis of their claim to Arabi.( 158 ) 72. In May 1950 it was discovered that a Saudi marker had been erected on the island about three months previously. It was demolished in August under notification to the Saudis and at the same time proposals were made to the Saudis for the discussion of the rival claims to this island and Farsi (paragraph 68 above). Harqus 73. This is only a sand-bank and in 1936 the Ruler of Kuwait denied all knowledge of it (paragraph 64 above). The history of the beacon on it is the same at that of the beacon on Arabi (paragraph 70 above). In 1949 the Ruler was again approached about this island and asked if he wished his claim to it supported as against Saudi Arabia.( 159 ) He replied in the affirmative. The island was mentioned in the note addressed to the Saudi Arabian Government in May 1949 (paragraph 65 above). ( 153 ) l.O. toF.O. 571/47 of March 21, 1947 (E 2526/64/91 of 1947).

In December 1950 it was discovered that a Saudi marker had been erected on the island. It was decided not to remove it in view of the Saudis' favourable reactions to His Majesty's Government's proposals about frontier negotiations in general. Qran and Qraiyn 75. In 1936 the Political Resident proposed that the Ruler of Kuwait should be encouraged to hoist his flag on Qran, the ownership of which had previously been regarded as indeterminate, but the action was not approved (paragraph 64 above) and no mention was made of the island when the Ruler was approached about other islands in the group in 1946 (paragraph 66 above). In 1937 the Political Resident reported that Kuwaitis visited both islands during the pearling season and to collect turtles and that the local opinion was that the islands belonged to Kuwait. He recommended that the Ruler should assert his sovereignty to both islands.( 1(i0 ) No action was taken at the time but in 1949 the Ruler was asked whether he wished his claim to the islands to be supported as against Saudi Arabia and replied in the affirmative.( 1(H ) The islands were mentioned in the note addressed to the Saudi Arabian Government in May 1949 (paragraph 65 above). 76. A landing-ground was constructed by the Arabian American Oil Company on Qran in about 1946 and used until September 1948. The company carried out structure drilling on the island. 77. In December 1950 Saudi markers were found on both islands. It was decided not to remove them in view of the Saudi's favourable reactions to His Majesty's Government's proposals about the settlement of frontier negotiations in general. Janah and Jar aid 78. Lorimer includes both these islands in the Hasa Sanjaq( 162 ) and in 1937 the Political Resident reported that although Kuwaiti fishermen visited the islands the Kuwaitis did not feel a strong sense of ownership in them and he accordingly recommended that no attempt should be made to establish Kuwait sovereignty over them.( 1G3 ) In March 1951 it was discovered that a marker had been erected by the Saudis on Janah. Although the Saudi claim to these islands has not been formally recognised, both are regarded provisionally as belonging to Saudi Arabia, and it has therefore been considered advisable that Her Majesty's Ships should avoid visiting them except in the case of an emergency. Maqta 79. This island is mentioned in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913( 1G1 ) as belonging to Kuwait. It lies immediately off the coast of territory which in the Kuwait-Najd Convention of 1922( 165 ) was recognised as belonging to Ibn Saud and it is presumably on this account that it was omitted from the list of islands communicated to the Ruler in 1923 (paragraph 58 above). The Political Resident suggested in 1948, that it should be claimed for Kuwait as a bargaining counter in the event of the Saudis claiming the islands off the Neutral Zone( 166 ) (Qaru and Umm al Maradim, paragraph 62 above), and in the 1951 it was included in a statement of Kuwait claims prepared at the Political Agency( ](&gt;7 ) (paragraph 63 above). (b) Kuwait Territorial Waters 80. In 1940 the Kuwait Oil Company enquired whether the Kuwait Bay was included in Kuwait territorial waters. The matter was examined and then dropped until the end of the war. In 1946 departmental discussion was resumed and a proposal that the Ruler should issue some kind of proclamation was rejected. Eventually he was asked to write to the Political Agent requesting him to inform the Kuwait Oil Company that Kuwait territory included the Kuwait Bay, the limit of territorial waters being a line drawn three nautical miles to the seaward and ( 160 ) l.O. to F.O.

It should be noted that although Her Majesty s Government only recognise a three-mile limit for Kuwait territorial waters, the Kuwait Oil Company's concession by agreement with the Ruler (paragraph 98 below) extends seawards up to a limit of six miles. (c) Neutral Zone Territorial Waters 82. In 1952 Her Majesty's Government instructed Her Majesty's Ambassador at Jedda to tell the Saudi Arabian Government that they were willing to concede that the Neutral Zone had both territorial waters and a sea-bed area.( 171 ) The question of the extent of the territorial waters has not yet been discussed with the Saudis and may give rise to difficulties as only a three-mile limit is claimed for Kuwait while the Saudis claim a six-mile limit. {d) Kuwait Sea-bed 83. In June 1949 the Ruler issued his declaration of rights in the sea-bed and subsoil contiguous to the territorial waters of Kuwait. Although one or two companies at that time made enquiries about an off-shore concession it was not until late in 1952 that a definite approach was made for one by the Standard Vacuum Oil Company. The Ruler replied that he was unable to take any action ' until such time as the question of the territorial waters and continental shelf off Kuwait is settled with Her Majesty's Government.'( 172 ) At the same time he asked for an early settlement of this question. Her Majesty's Government pointed out the very great difficulty of delimiting the Kuwait sea-bed as negotiations with Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Persia were involved and offered if the Ruler insisted, to define a provisional area in which a concessionary company could operated 173 ) The Ruler was not satisfied with this and decided not to grant a concession for his sea-bed until he knew more exactly the area in which a concessionaire would operate, and he requested Her Majesty's Government to use their utmost endeavours to settle the extent of his jurisdiction at the earliest possible date.( 174 ) He raised the question when he visited London for Her Majesty's Coronation and in December 1953 the Political Resident was instructed to inform him that a map had been prepared showing the area which might be claimed for Kuwait in any negotiations with her neighbours.( 175 ) This would shortly be shown to him for his approval and Her Majesty's Government would then endeavour to reach agreement with Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Persia might be involved later. Should he change his mind and decide to grant a concession before the boundaries were defined Her Majesty's Government would wish to advise him on the precise form in which he could indicate the extent of the proposed concession area to any interested oil company, At the same time Her Majesty's Government told the Political Resident that they had been working on the definition of a ' safe area ' which they would shortly communicate to him. {e) Neutral Zone Sea-bed 84. Although the Neutral Zone is defined in the Kuwait-Nejd Boundary Convention of 1922( 1,,, ) as being bounded on the east by the sea, Her Majesty's Government conceded in 1952 that it had both territorial waters and a sea-bed area and they instructed Her Majesty s Embassy at Jedda to propose that the ( 168 ) C.R.O. to F.O.

In September Her Majesty's Embassy at Jedda proposed to the Saudi Arabian Government that they and Kuwait should issue a joint proclamation and forwarded the proposed text of such a proclamation^ 179 ) 85. The Saudis did not reply until March 1953, when they informed Her Majesty's Government of their general agreement with the proposal made but suggested a number of alterations, mostly unimportant, in the wording of the draft.( 180 ) The only alteration of significance was the omission of a reference to the good offices of Her Majesty's Government being used to bring about a further agreement between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait concerning their rights in the sea-bed, in accordance with the formula used in the Kuwait-Nejd Boundary Convention^ 181 ) Her Majesty's Government approved the Saudi Arabian Govern ment's draft subject to two amendments but instructed Her Majesty's Ambassador not to address the Saudi Arabian Government further on the subject as they were examining the question of the administration of the Zone and did not wish to attract the Saudi's attention to it for the time being.( 182 ) No further progress had been made in the matter up to the end of 1953. VI.—Oil and Sulphur {a) Kuwait (i) Oil 86. In 1913 the Ruler gave an undertaking in writing( 183 ) that if an Admiral who was visiting Kuwait after seeing ' the place of bitumen in Burgan ' thought there was a hope of obtaining oil therefrom he would never give a concession for it to anyone except a person appointed by the British Government. Doubt has been expressed regarding the extent to which this agreement can be considered still binding on the Ruler( 184 ) and an effort made to improve upon it in 1935 failed (paragraph 89 below). 87. In the Historical Summary of Events for 1907-1928( 185 ) it is reported that negotiations for an oil concession in Kuwait by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had proved unfruitful. At the opening of the period under review the Eastern and General Syndicate represented by Major Holmes was the only company interested in Kuwait oil.( 186 ) Holmes prepared several draft concessions and made a number of visits to Kuwait but made no headway as he wished to assign the concession when obtained to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, an American company, and both His Majesty's Government and the Ruler insisted on a clause being included in the concession which would permit of its assignment to a British company only.( 187 ) In January 1931 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company reported that the geological information at their disposal did not encourage them to take any further steps about obtaining a concession for Kuwait, but later in the year they changed their minds and obtained permission to send a small party of geologists there. The United States Government complained of discrimination against American companies and Sir John Cadman informed the Foreign Office that any oil in Kuwait would not be of interest to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and that the Americans were i (177) p o to Jedda.

The Ruler was accordingly informed that His Majesty s , , 1 1ju ert insist upon confining the concession to a purely ^rihsh concein, rpnpral to dispense with this condition if he wished. In June 1932 the Eas t pp rQ i„ Syndicate submitted another draft concession and in September the Ang - e s an Oil Company also submitted a draft concession. His Majesty s Governmen compared the two concessions and sent their views on them to the I olitical Resident with instructions to communicate them to the Ruler and to leave the choice e ween the two companies to him.( 189 ) Meanwhile the United States Government continued to exert pressure in favour of American oil companies and it is interesting o note that the United States Ambassador in London at the time was the Chairman of the American oil group which was interested in the concession. The Ru er re used to be hurried in his choice between the two companies and in April 19^J instructed Holmes to prepare concessions reserving 1,200 square miles 0 1 j^ 18 territory tor the British Company and 400 square miles for the Americans. There was reason to believe at the time that he was also contemplating granting his share o* the Neutral Zone to the Americans if Ibn Saud took similar action. At the end of the year the Anglo-Persian Oil Company reached an agreement with Gulf Oil Company of America to share the Kuwait concession on a fifty-fifty basis and to form a company to be called the Kuwait Oil Company lor this purpose. His Majesty's Government raised no objection. 88. Negotiations with the Ruler for a concession started early in 1934 and in March a Political Agreement! 390 ) was signed between His Majesty's Government and Kuwait Oil Company. A copy of it was given to the Ruler and approved by him in writing.( 191 ) As he objected to certain references to this agreement in the draft concession under negotiation, these were embodied in an exchange of letters( 192 ) between the Political Agent and the Ruler and subsequently communicated to the company, who accepted the arrangements made as binding on them.( 193 ) The question of the appointment of a Chief Local Representative for the company caused difficulties between His Majesty's Government and the Ruler. The latter wished to have the right of choosing the Chief Local Representative but eventually gave way after His Majesty's Government had agreed to consult him before approving the appointment.! 194 ) The negotiations between the Ruler and the company were prolonged, and in September the Ruler, without consulting His Majesty's Government, agreed in writing to grant a concession to another entirely British Company called Traders, Limited, provided His Majesty's Government approved.! 195 ) This company's case was strongly supported by Lord Lloyd but in December the Ruler, as he had heard nothing further from it, decided to grant the concession to the Kuwait Oil Company. The agreement! 190 ) was signed on December 23 after His Majesty's Government had accorded their formal approval of this action to both the Ruler and the company.! 197 ) 89. In April 1934 the Political Agent had informed the Ruler that His Majesty's Government expected him to consult them before he opened negotiations with any company and in April 1935 the Political Resident wrote to the Ruler to the effect that His Majesty's Government took a serious view of his disregard of their wishes !by offering a concession to Traders, Limited, without consulting them) having regard both to his treaty obligations and the pains they had taken to safeguard his interests throughout the long negotiations.! 198 ) As the incident had called attention to the extremely loose wording of the oil agreement of 1913! 199 ) the Political Resident in a separate letter informed him that, in order that the position should be expressed in a clear and unambiguous form. His Majesty's Government considered it desirable that he should undertake not to grant concessions of any ( 188 ) (E 1897/121/91 of 1932.)

The Ruler sent an evasive reply to the first letter and in his reply to the second letter stated that he could not see his way to agree to the proposals except in so far as they concerned any oil concession in the Neutral Zone( 200 ) (Appendix G). Traders, Limited, sent a letter to the Shaikh refusing to accept his decision to grant a concession to the Kuwait Oil Company and threatening legal proceedings. 90. The concession granted by the Ruler to the Kuwait Oil Company was for 75 years and covered ' the State of Kuwait including all islands and territorial waters as shown generally on the maps annexed hereto.' A time-limit was set for drilling. The royalty was fixed at Rs. 3/- per ton and there was a down payment of Rs. 475,000. Annual payments were provided for of Rs. 95,000 before the company declared that oil had been found in commercial quantities, and of Rs. 250,000 after such declaration unless royalty was paid in excess of these sums. 91. In 1935 the company installed their local manager in Kuwait town and in 1936 they started drilling at Bahrah north of the Kuwait Bay. In 1937 they abandoned Bahrah where they had only found a show of oil, established a camp at Maqwa and started drilling at Burgan where they struck oil in the following year. In 1936 the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company transferred the ' beneficial ownership' of their holdings in the Kuwait Oil Company to the D'Arcy Exploration Company with His Majesty's Government's approval^ 201 ) In 1939 the Ruler, who had presumably heard of the negotiations for the Bahrain ' additional area ' (Chapter 2, paragraph 63), enquired whether the Kuwait Oil Company would be interested in a concession for his sea-bed area outside his territorial waters. The company were of opinion that their concession already automatically covered this area but enquired whether His Majesty's Government would have any objection to their negotiating a concession for it. His Majesty's Government replied that they would have no objection subject to certain conditions,( 202 ) but the matter does not appear to have been pursued presumably owing to the curtailment of the company's activities as a result of the war. His Majesty's Government also expressed the opinion that the Ruler could not grant any rights over any area lying outside his territorial waters but that he could grant a concession for his ' submerged land' and that under such a concession the company could appropriate ' such land for the Shaikh outside territorial waters by sinking shafts in it.' 92. In June 1939 the Ruler began to press the company to declare commercial production. The company feared that under the Political Agreement such action would involve them in an obligation to construct a refinery. His Majesty's Government agreed not to raise the refinery question for the time being but reserved their right to raise it when the oilfield developed.( 203 ) With the outbreak of war however the company decided not to declare commercial production and ' mudded off ' their wells. This led to difficulties with the Ruler but the company agreed to make to him the annual payment of Rs. 250,000 which would have been due if commercial production had been declared and to make advances against future royalties,( 204 ) 93. In 1942 the company suspended all drilling operations and did not resume them until 1945. In 1946 they started the construction of their main camp at Ahmadi about 25 miles south of Kuwait and at the end of June made their first shipment of oil from pipes taken into the sea at Fahahil about 5 miles east of Ahmadi. In 1949 they completed the construction of a large wharf at Fahahil and gave the port the name of Mina al Ahmadi. A power house and a small refinery were constructed close to the wharf. Regulations issued for the port by the Ruler in 1950 on the advice of His Majesty's Government were applied to persons subject to the Order in Council by a King's Regulation^ 205 ) ( 200 ) I.O. to F.O.

In 1947 the Shell Petroleum Company signed a the Gulf Oil Company for the purchase of their share ol the oil p Kuwait Oil Company.^'') 95. In October 1949 the Ruler made an ^ter' af er the increase in the royalty rate. The company agreed to discuss the mat arbitration proceedings over the islands (paragrap i comoanv further completed.( 2 '') Disagreement between the two c o m P on ® nts ' f [of i ?, was renortea delayed matters and the Ruler became impatient In Ma nationalise the oil that he had been asked in open Majlis whether he Proposed to 'ationalise the oil industry in Kuwait and that he had ignored the question.t ) y Arabian American Oil Company had entered into an ag , increasinslv Arabian Government on a fifty-fifty profit-sharing basis and it became increasingly obvious that the Kuwait Oil Company would have to follow i^ eir ^ July they offered a settlement to the Ruler on these lmes.( ) The ruler insisted that he should be given terms no less favourable than those which Iraq were obtaining from the Iraqi Petroleum Company. In the course of the negotiations the company agreed to withdraw their claims to any islands, other than those specified in their agreement, and to the sea-bed beyond the limits of territorial waters provided the Ruler abandoned certain demands based on his desire to receive the same treatment as Iraq. A settlement was reached on these lines and the Ruler also agreed to extend the company's concession to a distance of three miles over the sea-bed beyond the limits of territorial waters. 96 It was agreed that the fifty-fifty profit-sharing arrangement should be effected by the issue of an Income Tax Decree by the Ruler and in order that the American component of the company might derive relief on this account from income tax in the United States it became necessary that it should be constituted a separate company organised under the laws of the United States. A Gulf Kuwait Company was constituted accordingly and on November 30, 1951, with the written concurrence of the Ruler( 210 ) the Kuwait Oil Company assigned to it an undivided half interest in its concession of 1934. This was subsequently found to be a contravention of Article 26 of the Kuwait Order in Council, 1949 but the Political Resident was instructed to ignore this.C -11 ) 97. During the negotiations one of His Majesty's Government's chief concerns was that the large payments which would be due under the new arrangement should be made in sterling and not in rupees. The Ruler when approached on the subject at first insisted that the American component of the company should make payments in dollars but eventually agreed to accept all payments in sterling provided he received an assurance that dollars would be made available for goods and services which were essential for the benefit of Kuwait (but were not goods for trade) and which could not be obtained in the sterling area. An assurance was given to him in writing accordingly and acknowledged by him (Appendix H (i) and (ii)). 98. The Ruler signed the income-tax decree on December 29, 1951, and on December 31 it was made applicable to persons subject to the Order in Council by a King's Regulation.( 212 ) On December 30 the following documents were signed by the Ruler, by the local Manager of the Kuwait Oil Company acting on behalf of both the component companies and by the Political Agent as a witness: — (i) An agreement amending the 1934 Concession^ 213 ) (ii) A letter from the Company enclosing an Explanation of the present and contemplated future marketing of the crude oil produced in Kuwait' and undertaking {a) to consider a revision of the procedure proposed for calculating 'gross revenue' should circumstances change and (h) to review the situation should the Iraqi Government in the future receive a greater percentage of profit and/or should a pipeline be constructed to transport crude oil from Kuwait to the Mediterranean.( 214 ) (20 6 ) (£4747/63/91 of 1947.)

The islands of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm al Maradim were specifically excluded from it, but it was extended to a distance of six nautical miles from the base line used for delimiting the territorial waters of Kuwait. Apart from this the continental shelf appertaining to Kuwait was specifically excluded. The royalty remained at the same rate as in the original concession but all payments were to be made in sterling. Provision was made for payments in the event of the suspension of operations on account of force majeure and for a contribution towards the education of Kuwaitis at universities and schools outside Kuwait. The company made a payment to the Ruler of Rs. 100 million in full settlement of all his claims up to December 1, 1951. 99. In view of the change in the character of company effected by the assignment of November 30, 1951 (paragraph 96 above) His Majesty's Government deemed it necessary to execute new and separate Political Agreements with its two components, the D'Arcy Kuwait Company and the Gulf Kuwait Company. These agreements(' 17 ) were signed on January 6, 1953, and were formally accepted by the Kuwait Oil Company.(' L8 ) The agreements are identical except for one article which takes into account the different nationality of the two companies. The agreements follow closely the Political Agreement of March 5, 1934. There is some modification regarding the manner in and extent to which business with the Ruler is to be conducted through the Political Agent, and articles have been added covering frontier delimitation, navigation, fishing and pearling, and the special treaty relations existing between Her Majesty's Government and the Ruler. Copies of the agreements were sent to the Ruler with an explanatory letter( 219 ) and he was asked to confirm that the arrangements set out in the letter exchanged with his predecessor in May 1934 would continue to apply subject to one small modification. He replied accepting the new agreements( 220 ) but did not specifically confirm the arrangements made with his predecessors. The Political Agent considered that this omission was unintentional and that the confirmation asked for was inmlicit in his reply.( 221 ) 100. The amount of oil produced by the company in Kuwait rose steadily from the time of the first shipment in 1946 and was rapidly increased after the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's evacuation of Abadan in 1951. In May 1953 it reached the rate of a million barrels a day. As a result of this and of the agreement reached with the Ruler at the end of 1951 his revenue from oil in 1953 was expected to reach the figure of £60 million. 101. Article 4 of the Political Agreement of 193 4( 222 ) provided for the appoint ment of a Chief Local Representative by the company who would be responsible for their relations with the local authorities and prescribed that except as regards routine commercial business these relations should be conducted through the Political Agent. Colonel Dickson was appointed as the first Chief Local Representative under it and still held the appointment in 1953 when he reached the age of 72. In the beginning the company consistently failed to comply with this article and conducted their business with the Ruler or his staff without the intervention of the Chief Local Representative, except at times as an interpreter, and the Political Agent. The Political Resident called attention to this irregularity in 1949 and suggested that a new Chief Local Representative should be appointed and that the position should be regularised in accordance with the provisions of the Political Agreement^ 223 ) Discussion with the company followed, but it was generally agreed that it would be very difficult to persuade the Ruler to concur in Dickson's removal and no improvement in the situation was effected. The matter was raised again annually up to and including 1953. Dickson continued to be Chief Local Representative in name but at the end of 1952 the company appointed a Mr. Doyle ( 215 ) No. l (e) II, O.A.C. ( 216 ) No. 1 (/) II, O.A.C.

The company's relations with the Ruler and his people h av&lt; ^ varied but although disputes have arisen with the Ruler such as that over the three islands (paragraph 111 below) no serious breach has occurred and the company nave usually done their best to co-operate with the Kuwait Government. It is not their policy at present to set up a Public Relations Office in Kuwait probably because they wish to avoid entanglement in local politics.( 2 5 ) They have agreed to the Kuwait authorities taking over responsibility for their security arrangements (paragraph 29 above), and they pav for the education of a number of Kuwaitis in the United Kingdom. They are' fully alive to their responsibilities towards their local labour and are in the process of providing them with masonry accommodation to take the places of the huts and tents in which they have been living. They maintain an excellent Trade Training Centre at Magwa for illiterate and unskilled local labour, with staff and equipment for educating over two hundred persons^ 220 ) There have been strikes of Indian and Pakistanis but no serious strike of local labour has been reported. The question for the payment of compensation for industrial accidents has been the subject of correspondence and in 1949 the company agreed to accept the Shara Court's schedule subject to the provisions of the Order in CounciU 227 ) Efforts to persuade the Ruler to enact legislation on modern lines on this subject have failed (paragraph 36 above). (ii) Sulphur 103. In October 1940 the Ruler granted the Eastern Gulf Oil Company an option for a sulphur concession, which was on the same lines as the Kuwait Oil Company's oil concession the royalty being fixed at R. 1 as. 4 per ton.( 228 ) The company expressed their readiness to enter into a Political Agreement with His Majesty's Government. Such an agreement was drafted on the lines of the Kuwait Oil Company's Political Agreement but there is no evidence that it was ever executed. The Eastern Gulf Oil Company took up their option at the end of 1941 and drilled some wells but no sulphur was produced and the concession was relinquished in 1949. {b) Neutral Zone 104. Between 1933 and 1936 various companies were competing for a concession for the Saudi share of the Neutral Zone, for which the Standard Oil Company had been given an option, and there was much departmental discussion regarding the advice to be given to the Ruler regarding the grant of a concession for his share of the Zone.( 229 ) In 1934 he promised to inform the Political Agent of any overtures made to him for such a concession and in 1935 he stated that he had no intention of granting a concession for his share of the Zone for so long as Ibn Saud lived.( 2 i,, ) He felt sure that the best policy for Kuwait was to ' sterilise ' the zone. In 1936 he declined to enter into negotiations with Petroleum Concessions Limited for an option for the Zone, but promised to inform the company before anybody else if he changed his mind.( 231 ) In spite of this His Majesty's Government continued to explore ways and means of arranging for the gr ^o f concessions for both shares in the Neutral Zone to one company mainly with the object of helping Ibn Saud in his financial difficulties.

Approaches by the same company in 1940 and 1943 were similarly rejected. 105. In April 1946 the Ruler rejected another approach by the Gulf Oil Company but in September of the same year he wrote to the Political Agent saying that as he heard that Ibn Saud had granted a concession for his share of the Zone he considered it advisable to negotiate with any company wishing to take up a concession for his own share of it.( 2i ') He accordingly asked for His Majesty's Government's consent to his opening discussions with anyone coming forward. Ibn Saud had actually conceded his oil rights in the Zone to the Arabian American Oil Company in 1939. His Majesty's Government asked that Petroleum Concessions Limited's representative should be given a hearing before a concession was granted to any other party, in accordance with the Ruler's promise, but otherwise raised no objection provided the Ruler consulted the Political Agent before concluding an agreement^ 23 ') The Ruler agreed that Petroleum Concessions Limited might bid and announced his intention of giving the concession to the highest bidder. Competition for the concession continued throughout 1947 and in March 1948 the Ruler informed the Political Resident that he intended to close the auction in May and that he was proposing to ask the only four competitors whom he recognised, viz.. Petroleum Concessions Limited, the Burma Oil Company, the Gulf Oil Corporation and the American Independent Oil Company to send representatives to Kuwait in that month if they wished to be considered.( 231 ) Petroleum Concessions Limited dropped out of the competition and an American company called Amerada was admitted to it after the Shaikh's announcement. Eventually June 1 was fixed as the closing day. A representative of the Royal Dutch Shell Company arrived in Kuwait on May 28 but was not allowed to compete. When the bids were scrutinised the offer of the American Independent Oil Company was found to be the most favourable one and on June 4 the Ruler decided to grant the concession to that company. He refused to sign the agreement until His Majesty's Government had approved and obtained a satisfactory Political Agreement from the company. These conditions were fulfilled and the concession agreement( 235 ) was signed on June 28, 1948. 106. The concession was for 60 years and covered the Neutral Zone including all islands and territorial waters pertaining to it. Provision was made for drilling to be undertaken within specified periods. The signature payment was fixed at 7^ million dollars with an annual payment of 625,000 dollars until oil was found and a royalty of 2J dollars per ton. The Ruler was also to receive 15 per cent, of the shares of a subsidiary company to be formed for the working of the concession. All payments were to be made in dollars. The company are under an obligation within four years from the date of the discovery of oil to begin the construction of a hospital and a ' program of education.' 107. The Political Agreement( 236 ) was signed in London on June 26, 1948. It provided that the company operating the concession must be either American or British and that its employees must as far as possible be Americans, British or subjects of the Ruler. Under it the company acknowledged the 1899 agreement with Shaikh Mubarak,( 237 ) and His Majesty's Government agreed not to insist upon its observance provided the company did not use for its operations sites selected for defence and certain other purposes. The company also acknowledged the special treaty relations existing between His Majesty's Government and the Ruler and it was provided that nothing in the agreement should be construed as interfering with Saudi rights in the Zone. Authority was granted for a copy of the agreement to be given to the Ruler in 1950( 238 ) but it does not appear that he was asked to take cognisance of its terms. 108. Ibn Saud was not consulted before the concession agreement was signed and in July 1948 he wrote to the Ruler complaining about this and saying he could not express an opinion about it until he had seen it.( 239 ) In September he informed (252) j q t0 p Q £ xt 0 £ October 14, 1946 (E 10356/5706/91 of 1946).

Meanwhile they were not to start work.( 240 ) The latter company accordingly started negotiations ior the Saudi Arabian share of the Zone but these quickly broke down and in February 1949 the concession^ 41 ) for this share was granted to the Pacific Western Oil Corporation on terms more favourable to Ibn Saud than those which were obtained by Ahmad from his company.( 242 ) 109. Shortly before the grant of this concession Ibn Saud had told the Ruler that the American Independent Oil Company could start work on the Zone, and they later reached an agreement with the Pacific Western Oil Corporation whereby they assumed sole responsibility for the initial operations. They started work at the end of 1949. Their Manager took up his residence in Kuwait and their American operating personnel were housed in a vessel anchored off the shore of the Zone so that no administrative problems arose. Several wells were drilled and no oil was struck until March 1953. By October three wells were producing about 2,000 barrels a day each and the company hoped to be exporting oil by the end of the year.( 243 ) They reached an agreement with the Pacific Western Oil Company whereby they would continue to operate on behalf of both companies and they would export the latter's share of the oil as well as their own through one line having an outlet to marine loading points in Kuwait territory north of the Zone's boundary,^ 11 ) though the Saudis were not expected to acquiesce in this arrangement for long and there were rumours that they intended to move into the Zone without warning in the same way as they did into Buraimi in 1952 (Trucial States, paragraph 101). 110. In 1952 the Ruler agreed to grant to the company rights over the sea-bed off the Zone, similar to the rights which had been granted to the Kuwait Oil Company in the agreement of 1951 (paragraph 98 above), to a distance of three miles beyond the limits of territorial waters. The company gave to Her Majesty's Government an undertaking^ 45 ) to do nothing to prejudice the fixing of the boundaries of sea-bed area pertaining to the Zone and to carry out operations with due legard to the character of the high seas outside territorial waters and in particular to interfere to the minimum extent possible with navigation, fishing and pearling.( ) Her Majesty s Government in acknowledging this communication furnished the company with their views on the delimitation of territorial waters.^ 47 ) A draft agreement with the Ruler was approved by Her Majesty's Government^ ) but discussions of its terms with the Ruler's representative ensued and eventually Her Majesty s Government asked that its execution should be held up pending the issue of a joint declaration of rights over the sea-bed of the Zone by Kuwait^and Saudi Arabia (paragraphs 84-85 above). In these circumstances the agreement had not been signed by the end of 1953. In the meanwhile the Legal Advisers of the Foreign Office called attention to the fact that a phrase in the draft agreement and also m the original concession agreement of July 1948, might be interpreted as limiting the Ruler s right to reach a further agreement with the King of Saudi Arabia regarding their respective rights in the Neutral Zone as contemplated in the Kuwait-Najd Boundary Convention of I922( 2 ') (paragraph 37 above) The company were asked for an assurance that no such interpretation would be put on the phrase but refused to give it.(- 50 ) It was accordingly prooosed at the end of 1953 to bring the position to the Ruler's notice. ct the ei d (c) The I si a nas of Kuhbar, Qaru and Umm al Mar ad in been pLiUed^ Sd^S (C) It C 0 F 0 - 172 0f September 14 ' 1948 (E 12056/72/91 of 1948).

Both the Foreign Office and the Political Resident were of the opinion that rights in these islands had already been granted to the Kuwait Oil Company although they were not specifically mentioned in their concession nor shown in the maps attached to it. The Ruler informed the American Independent Oil Company that the islands were not included in their Neutral Zone concession but also asserted that they were not included in the Kuwait Oil Company's concession. Much controversy followed and representatives of the American Independent Oil Company submitted affidavits that the Ruler had informed them orally but categorically that the islands were included in their concession. They complained of the action ol the political authorities in the Gulf and their complaint was mildly supported by the United States Embassy in London. In February 1949 the Kuwait Oil Company wrote to the Ruler's representative claiming that their concession covered not only the three islands but the sea-bed as well. The Ruler rejected this claim, but in March gave them 91 days in which to adduce proof of it. They forwarded to him a voluminous report on the subject by Professor Lauterpacht but he refused to change his mind and on September 22, 1949, with the approval of His Majesty's Cfovernment he granted a concession for the islands to the American Independent Oil Company. The concession agreement( 252 ) was for a period of 60 years and covered the three islands and their territorial waters. The company were obliged to begin geological exploration within six months and to drill within three years. No payment appears to be due to the Shaikh under the agreement until oil is discovered. The royalty is fixed at 2-J- dollars per ton and the Ruler is promised 15% of the shares of a subsidiary company to be formed to work the concession. The company agreed that the concession should terminate if it was decided as a result of arbitration proceedings that the Kuwait Oil Company had a prior right to exploit the petroleum resources of the islands and that they would indemnify the Shaikh for any damages for which he might become liable to the Kuwait Oil Company in such circumstances. The Political Agreement^ 53 ) which was signed on September 21, 1949, followed the lines of that for the Neutral Zone (paragraph 107 above). Authority was granted for a copy of it to be given to the Ruler in 1950,( 254 ) but it does not appear that he was asked to take cognisance of its terms, probably because they do not include any provision for the termination of the concession. In November the Kuwait Oil Company informed the Ruler's representative that they wished to refer their dispute over oil rights in the islands to arbitration under Article 18 of their concession. They announced the name of their arbitrator and asked that the Ruler should also nominate one. The Ruler never made a nomination and his lawyer tried to argue that it was contrary to Islamic law that he should submit to arbitration but in the settlement reached with the Ruler at the end of 1951 (paragraph 95 above) the Kuwait Oil Company formally abandoned their claim. 112. The American Independent Oil Company had not started work on the islands up to the end of 1953. The requirement that they should begin drilling within a fixed period was regarded as in abeyance pending the settlement of the Kuwait Oil Company's claim to the islands, but the Ruler's representative wrote to them on November 27, 1951 to the effect that the Ruler regarded the relative provisions of their concession agreement as being in force from that date.( 255 ) In December 1953 the Political Agent informed the Ruler that there was no objection to his authorising the company to start work on the islands but the Ruler is perhaps unlikely to do this until he is sure that the Saudis no longer claim a half share in the islands of Qaru and Umm al Maradim (paragraph 62 above). {d) Kuwait Sea-bed 113.

When the Ruler would not agree to this they demanded a reference of the dispute to arbitration and nominated an arbi ra . er failed to make a nomination and the matter remained pending unti i of 1951 when in the settlement reached with the Ruler over the sharing or pro s the company abandoned their claim to rights over the sea-bed, ex cept ' 0l ^ to three miles from the outward limits of territorial waters which the Ru er then conceded to them (paragraph 95 above). 114. In 1949 one or two other companies showed an interest in the Kuwait sea-bed but made no definite proposals to the Ruler. An approach to him i or a concession was eventually made by the Standard Vacuum Oil Company towards the end of 1952 but he declined to grant one until the limits of his sea-bed had been defined (paragraph 83 above). ie) Neutral Zone Sea-bed 115. The Central Mining Corporation had some talks with the Saudi authorities about a concession for the Saudi share of the Neutral Zone sea-bed in 1948( 256 ) but nothing came of these. No declarations of rights over the sea-bed pertaining to the Zone had been made by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia up to the end of 1953 (paragraph 85 above) so that it has not yet been possible for the Ruler of either country legally to grant a concession for it. In 1952 and 1953 however the American Independent Oil Company were negotiating for an extension of their concession for the Kuwait share of the Zone over the sea-bed up to a distance of three miles from the outer limits of territorial waters (paragraph 110 above). VI.—Relations with Other Countries {a) Other Gulf States 116. The present Ruler is on good terms with the Rulers of all the Gulf States except Muscat. He was on a visit to Muscat immediately before his predecessor's death and was annoyed by the regal attitude which the Sultan adopted. His relations with the other Rulers are cordial but his frequent visits to them and especially to Bahrain are coming to be regarded as rather an imposition. There is a certain amount of friendly jealousy between Kuwait and Bahrain. {b) Iraq (i) General 117. For most of the period under review relations between Iraq and Kuwait have been strained. There have been frequent Iraqi incursions into Kuwait territory, and some Kuwaiti incursions into Iraq, and there have been campaigns against Kuwait in the Iraqi press and demands for its annexation to Iraq. The main Iraqi grievance has been the smuggling of goods from Kuwait, where the customs duties are very low, to Iraq, where they are high. On the Kuwait side the main grievance, apart from Iraqi violations of the frontier, has been the expropriation of the ruling family's date-gardens in Iraq. It is 'unnecessary to give details of all the incidents which have occurred and the protests made regarding them. In nearly all cases the protests have been ineffective, and led to counter- accusations. . J, n the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq recommended that His Majesty s Government should aim at the gradual absorption of Kuwait by Iraq- He was informed that His Majesty s Government were of the opinion that the policy previously followed should be continued, namely that Kuwait should be maintained as a piotect^d State entirely independent of either Irao or Najd. ^257 ) In 1938 the Iraqi Government tried to argue that as they were the successor of the Turkish Government Kuwait should be incorporated in Irap (paragraph 43 above).

Most of the frontier incidents arose out of the intensive smuggling from Kuwait to Iraq and the efforts made by the Iraqis to stop it. In addition to preventive measures on the frontier the Iraqis made many approaches on the subject to His Majesty's Embassy at Bagdad. Much advice was offered to the Ruler but His Majesty's Government declined to bring ' pressure ' to bear on him as he was under no legal obligation to stop smuggling from his territory. In 1935 he was urged amongst other things to appoint a British Director of Customs who would introduce a system of manifests and take other steps to ensure that goods for Kuwait did not evade the Iraqi customs authorities.(' 38 ) He politely rejected this proposal. Not only did he fear the anger of Ibn Saud, whose request for the appointment of a representative at Kuwait to regulate exports he had refused, but he was unwilling to risk the local unpopularity which he would incur by taking effective steps to stop the smuggling. At that time owing to the decline in the pearl trade and the Saudi blockade Kuwait's economy was at a very low ebb, and though it was reported that the merchants themselves did not actively participate in the smuggling they no doubt reaped much profit from the sale of goods to those who did. The Ruler agreed to take some half measures but these were unacceptable to the Iraqis who in 1935 proposed that a quota system for imports should be applied to Kuwait which would be administered by a British Director of Customs in conjunction with the Iraqi customs and that a joint Kuwait- Iraqi preventive service should be formed.( 259 ) These proposals could inot be accepted. The Iraqis in retaliation for the smuggling withdrew the draw-back privilege which goods re-exported from Basra to Kuwait had previously enjoyed,( 260 ) and from time to time threatened a blockade, which was never actually enforced, while their press inveighed against Kuwait and clamoured for its incorporation in Iraq. Conferences between Kuwait and Iraq were from time to time proposed and in 1934 some Iraqi representatives visited Kuwait for informal discussion but the Ruler refused to participate on the ground that he had not invited them.( 21il ) Throughout the controversy he fought a very able defensive action and succeeded in giving nothing away. A detailed note on contraband running from Kuwait not only to Iraq but also to Saudi Arabia was prepared by the Political Agent at Kuwait in 1933 and forwarded by the Political Resident to His Majesty's Government^ 262 ) and the course of the controversy was described and discussed in a Foreign Office Memorandum prepared in May 1935( 263 ) and in a despatch from the Political Resident written in November of the same year.( 2 ' 4 ) The controversy continued for many years after this and Iraqi complaints extended not only to the smuggling of merchandise but also to that of arms (paragraph 191 below). The Iraqi Foreign Minister raised the question when he visited London in 1938 (paragraph 51 above). He alleged that the Iraqi Government were suffering a loss of £250,000 a year in their customs revenue and, if His Majesty's Government were unwilling to agree to the incorporation of Kuwait in Iraq, proposed either a Customs Union between Iraq and Kuwait, or the cession of a large portion of Kuwait territory, or combined preventive operations.( 205 ) None of these solutions could be accepted. 120. No more success attended the efforts to deal with the frequent frontier incidents. In 1936 the Political Resident proposed a mixed Commission to investigate them but His Majesty's Embassy at Bagdad did not favour the proposal.( 26&lt;i ) Early in 1937 a meeting was arranged at Safwan between the Iraqi Commandant and British Inspecting Officer of Police at Basra and the Political Agent to make enquiries into certain cases. The atmosphere of the meeting was cordial but nothing appears to have resulted from it and His Majesty's Ambassador was unable to persuade the Iraqis to agree to further meetings.( 2 ' i7 ) In 1939 it was decided that to facilitate a solution of the problem it was desirable to demarcate the frontier but efforts to persuade the Iraqi Government to agree to this failed (paragraph 45 above). In the same year the Iraqis wished to send an envoy to ( 258 ) I.O. to F.O. P.Z. 4125/1935 of June 17, 1935 (E 3722/127/91 of 1935). ( 259 ) Bagdad to F.O.

There were several serious vio frontier by Iraqi police in this year, and the Iraqi Government set ^ s Pecia committee of enquiry to investigate the allegations made.( ) They r p no evidence could be found to support them. At the same time is j y Government agreed that the Ruler of Kuwait should establish a P 0 1C ^, P s , „ the frontier.( 270 ) The police were to use peaceful means to secure the wi urawa or Iraqi patrols but if they were compelled to use force the Ruler was promised His Majesty's Government's full support. So far as is known this post was no established. 121. The popular agitation against the Ruler in 1938 and 1939 (paragraph li above) was fanned from Iraq and violent attacks were made on him in the Iraqi press, and from King Ghazi's broadcasting station, and demands were made that the Iraqi army should march on Kuwait. In reply to a question on the subject in the House of Commons it was stated that His Majesty's Government recognised the Shaikhdom of Kuwait as an independent Government under British protection and that urgent representations had been made to the Iraqi Government to secure the cessation of the propaganda against the Ruler.j'' 1 ) The disturbance at Kuwait in March 1939 was reported by the Political Resident to be entirely due to Iraqi propaganda.( 272 ) 122. Iraqi incursions and smuggling from Kuwait continued but nothing further of note occurred until 1945 when the Ruler's son Muhammad was wounded by an Iraqi patrol near Zubair and his servant killed. The two police concerned were arrested and given light sentences.('' ) In March 1948 three Iraqis, one of them a member of the well-known Sa'adun family, who were probably engaged in smuggling, were killed in Kuwait territory, it was alleged by a member of the ruling family called Subah al Nasir. The Ruler exiled Subah for a time but he soon returned and no further action was taken against him. Demands for justice were received from the Iraqi Government over a period of years and eventually in 1951 the Ruler paid compensation to the heirs of the murdered man without admitting Subah's guilt. In 1949 in view of Iraqi demands for the return of certain offenders who had taken refuge in Kuwait the Political Resident with the concurrence of the Ruler proposed that a formal Extradition Treaty should be concluded between Kuwait and Iraq.( 271 ) A draft was prepared and shown to the Ruler who asked for the omission of a reference to smuggling which it contained. After much argument it was agreed to omit this reference and the draft was presented to the Iraqi Government in November 1951.( 273 ) Subsequently the Ruler agreed to include the reference to smuggling but the Iraqi Government have not been informed of this. In June 1953 the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed Her Majesty's Embassy at Bagdad that the Iraqi Government were reluctant to conclude with Her Majesty's Government any agreement concerning Kuwait which would have to be presented to the Iraqi Parliament for ratification as this would lead to their being accused by the Opposition of recognising Her Majesty's Government's special position in the Gulf.C') They therefore proposed that the Extradition Treaty between Her Majesty's Government and Iraq of May 2, 1932,( 277 ) should be extended to Kuwait. This proposal was put to the Ruler who agreed to it.( 278 ) Her Majesty's Government were of opinion that before the Treaty could be extended it would be necessary to make an extradition law for Kuwait. It was proposed to embody such a law in a Queen's Regulation and to ask the Ruler to issue a law of his own on the same lines, but the preparation of the Regulation had not been taken in hand by the end of 1953. The Political Resident called attention to the difficulties likely to arise in other cases if the Iraqi Government persist in the attitude adopted on this occasion, and to the undesirability of allowing them to get the impression that valid agreements can be made with Kuwait otherwise than by the agency of Her Majesty's Government^ 279 ) (288) f rom Baghdad to P.O. 91 of March 25, 1939 (E 2216/66/91 of 1939).

When the Ruler visited Bagdad in March 1952 he and his staff discussed a number of matters with the Iraqi authorities. He was informed by the Prime Minister that Kuwait could have as much water as it liked from Iraq provided all the expenditure involved was borne by Kuwait (paragraph 23 above), that in future Kuwaitis would be allowed to acquire property in their own names in Iraq, and that the Iraqi Government would help in the matter of the date gardens.( 280 ) At a lower level it was agreed that it was desirable to abolish visas for Iraqis visiting Kuwait and vice versa and to reduce postal and cable charges between the two countries. The Iraqis also agreed that they would allow the export of fruit, vegetables, wheat and flour to Kuwait when they were plentiful, that Kuwaiti private cars might enter Iraq and stay there for short periods without paying customs duty and that goods destined for Kuwait should be allowed to move freely in transit through Iraq.( 281 ) The Ruler handed to the Political Agent draft agree ments which had been prepared in Bagdad about customs arrangements and Posts and Telegraphs, and urged that early action should be taken to embody them in formal agreements between Her Majesty's Government and the Iraqi Government before the latter changed their mind.( 282 ) Her Majesty's Government prepared a draft trade agreement based on the draft customs agreement, but omitting a provision for the boycott of Zionist goods which the latter contained, and forwarded it to the Political Resident to obtain the Ruler's approval of it.( 283 ) After this had been done it was presented to the Iraqi Government who raised the same objection about entering into an agreement with Her Majesty's Government in respect of Kuwait as they had done in the case of the proposed Extradition Agreement (paragraph 122 above) and made alternative proposals.( 284 ) Her Majesty's Embassy was instructed to return to the charge with the Iraqi Government and to show them the Kuwait Saudi-Arabian Trade Agreement( 285 ) as a precedent but no further progress had been made in the negotiation of the agreement by the end of 1953. So far as the proposed agreement for the abolition of visas between Kuwait and Iraq was concerned Her Majesty's Embassy at Bagdad wrote to the Iraqi Government on the subject in May 1952. In February 1953 they wrote again suggesting that as the Kuwaiti authorities had decided in June 1952 that Iraqi nationals need no longer obtain visas in order to visit Kuwait, the Iraqi authorities should accord reciprocal treatment to Kuwaitis pending the conclusion of a formal agreement^ 28 ') The Iraqi Government replied that they had decided to abolish visas between Iraq and Kuwait on certain bases and asked for confirmation that these bases were acceptable to the Kuwaiti authorities. These bases were applicable to all Arab countries and the Iraqi Government subsequently forwarded them in a revised form headed ' Instructions for the abolition of visas between Iraq and Kuwait.'( 2S7 ) The Kuwait Government concurred in the instructions in October 195 3( 28S ) but no agreement had been concluded by the end of the year. The proposals made by the Iraqis about Post and Telegraphs were discussed by the General Post Office and Cable and Wireless, Ltd. respectively at a departmental level with the Iraqi Director General of Posts and Telegraphs and a measure of agreement reached (paragraphs 201 and 208 below). 124. In 1926 it was held that Iraqis in Kuwait were entitled to the Political Agent's protection^ 289 ) Iraq was at the time under a British Mandate, and it is presumed that the Political Agent's special responsibility towards Iraqis ceased with the Mandate in 1932. On the judicial side Iraqis have been under the Ruler's jurisdiction since the issue of the first Order in Council in 1925.( 290 ) Until 1949 the Political Agent issued visas for Iraq on behalf of the Iraqi Government but since then his responsibilities with regard to Iraq do not extend beyond those which he exercises on behalf of any other foreign country outside the Commonwealth. 125. In 1931 the Ruler agreed to effect the service in Kuwait of summonses and other judicial documents issued by Iraqi Courts when forwarded through the ( 280 ) Kuwait to P.O. 31/11/52 of March 9, 1952 (EA 1941/7 of 1952). psi) Kuwait to P.O. 3112/52 of March 10, 1952 (EA 10393/8 of 1952).

No reply was, however, sent to it until the American appointment became a fait accompli in 1951, when His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad informed the Iraqi Government that His Majesty's Government were willing to agree to the appointment of an Iraqi Consul at Kuwait on conditions similar to those prescribed for the United States Consul( 2!KS ) (paragraph 164 below). The Iraqi Government have not pursued the proposal, possibly because of their unwillingness formally to recognise Her Majesty's Government's position in Kuwait (paragraph 122 above), and it was not mentioned when the Ruler visited Iraq in March 1952. In 1950 the Political Agent reported that there were about 2,500 Iraqis registered with the Kuwait authorities as being resident in Kuwait and that the correspondence about them received from the Iraqi authorities through the British authorities in Iraq was substantial.( 299 ) 127. Generally speaking during the last few years relations between Kuwait and Iraq have greatly improved and since Kuwait's acquisition of wealth Iraq appears to be courting instead of abusing her, but whatever attitude Iraq adopts there is little doubt that her ultimate aim remains the absorption of Kuwait (paragraph 118 above). Only one frontier incident has been reported since 1950, when Abdullah al Mubarak's men found two Iraqi policemen in Kuwait territory and beat them up, and practically nothing has been heard about smuggling, on which Kuwait economy is no longer dependent. Nuri Pasha when Prime ^Minister of Iraq visited Kuwait in 1951 and the Ruler paid a State visit to Bagdad in March 1952 when he was feted and he and his staff were given decorations. The Regent visited Kuwait in 1952 and again with the King of Iraq in 1953, in which year a mission from Kuwait attended the King's Coronation in Basda'd. (ii) The Date Gardens Case 128.

The properties covered by the 1914 declaration are stated to be as follows: — (i) A1 Farhawiyah. This was purchased by the Shaikh of Kuwait about 1870 before a Tapu Department was established. (ii) A1 Mutawwah. This was acquired by purchase and registered in Tapu. (iii) A1 Faddaghiyah. This was purchased by Shaikh Mubarak in 1908 from the wife of Ahmad Pasha, who held a power of attorney from her for the transaction. The Turkish authorities refused to register the property unless Mubarak became a Turkish subject, which on His Majesty's Government's advice he declined to do. In 1915 the British Revenue Commissioner in Basra, on application being made to him, registered the property in Mubarak's name. (iv) A1 Bashiyah. This, which is sometimes described as part of (iii) above, was purchased by Mubarak in 1908 from Shafiqah the widow of Ali Pasha, who sold it on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor children, the deed of sale being witnessed by numerous important residents of Basra. In the case of this property also registration was found to be impossible while the Turks remained in Iraq. In 1915 an application was made to the British Revenue Commissioner in Basra to have the position regularised but on the date fixed for the hearing of the case the vendor was seriously ill. She died shortly afterwards, leaving five daughters and the property remained unregistered. (v) A1 Fao. This was acquired by deed of gift from Rash ad al Sa'adun. (vi) Al Ujairawiyah. This was purchased by Mubarak in 1912 and registered in Tapu in the name of his daughter Sharifah. This lady had just married his nephew Saud, who was resident in Iraq, and Mubarak gave the garden to her as a wedding gift. On her death without children in about 1920 half the property reverted to the descendants of Mubarak. Saud then married Mariam, another daughter of Mubarak, gave her the other half of the property and, as the title deeds of it had been lost, in 1929 registered the whole of it again in the name of Sharifah.( 30:5 ) It is not clear whether this garden can be regarded as having been in the de facto possession of Mubarak in 1914. 130. A detailed description of these properties was furnished by the Political Agent in 1934. He obtained the information from the Ruler, who stipulated that none of it except that relating to the Faddaghiyah property should be divulged to the Iraqi Government or any persons connected with it.( 304 ) In 1948 the area of the Mutawwah property (item ii) was reported to be 495 jaribs( ) and its value about £87,000, the area of the Faddaghiyah property (item iii), including what was left to the Ruler of the Bashiyah property (item iv), 909 jaribs and its value about £150 000 and the area of the Fao property (item v) 6,964 jaribs and its value about £1 100,000.( 30fi ) The area of the other two properties is small and the Ujairawiyah one (item vi) was reported in 1934 to be only about 50 jaribs. There is nothing on record about their value. 131 Up to the end of 1953 no dispute had arisen over items (i), (ii) and (vi) of these properties. Litigation regarding the Bashiyah estate started in Iraq in 1930 and continued until 1943. As a result of it the Ruler was deprived of 180 out of 216 shares in the property. In 1948 he was asked by His Majesty's Government to submit a formal claim for compensation and he claimed £8,400 which was the price he had paid for the re-purchsse of the shares lost by litigation. This sum was paid to him and he furnished a formal discharge absolving His Majesty's Government for further liability in respect of the shares concerned( J07 ) f 30r » Paras 44 and 45 at p. 83 of P.G. 13.

In 1930 His Majesty's Covernment took the wns under the guarantee of 1914 (paragraph 128 Government never Article 8 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 ( ) ine iraq Kingdom H i„ h specifically accepted this '7, but ™ of let 4 (^XT^andKn August 1930 that the obl |ation should b^inclu^d^ fo^et'h?eC°tfpr^^ liauidation and that if these were successful the question would be discussed between the two Govermneiits.r'! The undertaking entere 1 m o wi Kuwait in respect of his date gardens in Iraq was includea in the list of International Instruments referred to in Article 8 of the 1930 Treaty accordingly.( ) The High ^mrniSfoner subsequently tried to effect a settlement by direct negotiation between t^^mqi Government and the Ruler on the basis of the purchase of the gardens by the former, but the emissary whom the Iraqi Government sent to Kuwait for discussions made no mention of the purchase of the gardens but mereiy mformed the Ruler that his Government insisted on its right to tax his estates but would be content with the sum of £4,500 a year only. The Ruler declined this offer and referred the matter to His Majesty s Government. 133 In 1932 when a decision had been given against the Ruler in the litigation over the Bashiyah estate (paragraph 131 above), he requested His Majesty s Government to safeguard his interests in his property. Accordingly in May 1933 King Faisal was asked to intervene and undertook to ensure that the Ruler would remain in possession of his date gardens, an assurance which he reaffirmed at an interview with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in June of the same year.( 311 ) Faisal died shortly afterwards, but in September 1933 King Ghazi reaffirmed his father's promise.* 312 ) 134. At this time His Majesty's Government were concerned both with a tax called the Istihlak tax which the Iraqi Government had imposed in 1932 on the produce of date gardens and with the possibility of the Ruler's losing part of his property as a result of litigation. The Law Officers of the Crown who had been considering the legal aspects of the 1914 guarantee expressed the view that His Majesty's Government were under a legal obligation to compensate the Ruler in respect of any tax which he might be compelled to pay and of any property of which he might be deprived by litigation.* 313 ) In April 1938 representatives of the Foreign Office, India Office and Treasury agreed that the 1914 guarantee covered all the properties in the de facto possession of Shaikh Mubarak in 1914.( 311 ) Later in 1949 the Legal Adviser of the Foreign Office held that the guarantee applied to Mubarak's personal share in the properties only (and not to the shares of his collaterals) and that it has since extended to such of them as are in the possession of his lineal descendants.* ') So far as is known this position has never been explained to the Ruler. 135. Various suggestions for dealing with the problems raised by the date gardens were considered during 1934 and 1935 and eventually in July 1936 a letter( 316 ) (Appendix I (iv)) was addressed to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs in | rej (sos) p 280, Vol. 132, State Papers.

No further claim would be made for the exemption of the properties from taxation provided the Iraqi Government undertook not to claim arrears and to impose no discriminatory taxation in the future. With regard to the possession of the properties, all uncertainties should be removed regarding their boundaries, and a formal title to them should be awarded to the Ruler through the application of the procedure laid down in the Iraqi Land Settlement Law of 1932. His Majesty's Government undertook to abide by the decisions of the Land Settlement Officer as to the boundaries of the properties and not to make any claim against the Iraqi Government in respect of any changes in them resulting from the land settlement procedure. An assumption was made that orders would be issued by the appropriate Iraqi authorities to ensure that the Ruler's non-Iraqi nationality would constitute no impediment to the compilation of the registration. The Iraqis received these proposals well, but endeavoured to make their acceptance of them conditional upon Kuwait's acceptance of certain proposals about smuggling which they had put forward in 1935 (paragraph 119 above). They eventually replied in October 1938.( 317 ) Their note (Appendix I (v)) accepted His Majesty's Government's proposals subject to a few reservations, and it was confirmed that the nationality of the Ruler would constitute no impediment to the completion of the registration of the properties. The Iraqi Government insisted that in future they should exercise Iraqi jurisdiction over all the properties in the same way as they did over other immovable property in Iraq. His Majesty's Embassy informed the Iraqi Government that His Majesty's Government accepted the terms of the reply (Appendix I (vi)). 136. As a result of the promise made to the Iraqi Government not to make any further claim for the exemption of the properties from taxation it became necessary to compensate the heirs of Mubarak for the losses which they had suffered or would suffer from the imposition of the Istihlak tax. A sum of £30,694 was accordingly paid to the Ruler in 1940 in return for a discharge of His Majesty's Government's guarantee of the immunity of the properties from taxation (Appendix I (vii)). 137. The Land Settlement Law of 1932 referred to in the note of July 1936 to the Iraqi Government (paragraph 135 above) was replaced by a new law in 1938, but Her Majesty's Government have never insisted that under the terms of the exchange of notes in 1936 and 1938 the Ruler's properties should be dealt with under the old law. The new law contained a provision that land which was not ' mulk ' (freehold) could be registered as ' miri ' (Crown) land granted in ' tapu ' (registration) in the name of the person who had planted it with trees or used it productively for not less than ten years prior to the settlement decision. In March 1941 it became known to His Majesty's Embassy at Bagdad that the Iraqi Government were intending to amend the 1938 law so as to provide that any person in whose name land was so registered must be an Iraqi. His Majesty s Embassy were able to obtain the insertion of a clause in this provision that it would not apply to foreigners to whom the Iraqi Government had previously undertaken to grant miri land within the Basra Liwah. In August 1941 the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed in a note (Appendix I (viii)) that this clause was intended to cover the Ruler of Kuwait and that there was nothing in the law to affect the exchange of letters of 1936 and 1938. 138 The Land Settlement procedure appears only to have been applied to Faddagliiyah and Fao estates. The whole of the former was registered in the Ruler's name, and appeals against this decision failed (paragraph 131 abo\e). The Fao estate is the largest and most important of the Ruler s properties in Iraq. The Ruler had been having trouble with his tenants on it since 1934.^ The estate was registered by the Land Settlement Committee as belonging to the heirs of ShaiklTiabir bin Abdullah al Subah ' (who died in 1859), one plot as mulk and the remaining six plots as miri granted in Tapu, and this decision was notified in the Iraqi Government Gazette of February 1944. Nearly 3,000 appeals were lodged by the tenants against it, and orders were not passed on them until July 1949. Meanwhile, the Ruler was unable to obtain his share of the produce from the tenants and in 1946 the Political Agent calculated that he had lost £50,000 in this manner Further the tenants had succeeded in obtaining possession of accretions of cultivable land between the gardens and the Shatt al Arab to which the owner of the property would ordinarily be entitled. Another complication was the ( 317 ) Bagdad to F.O. 543 of November 3, 1938 (E 6676/28/93 of 1938). 46639 0 2f 98 subdivision of the property amongst n up er0 '^^ and the difficulty experienced by the Ruler ,n obta n |n S ^ power ° ?' orne y « act for all of them. In a document obtained from the Kuwait ^ number of the shares involved runs into astronomical g • - , Court upheld the decision that one plot belonged to s ubah famil^y as mulk but found that in the other six plots a little more than halt th ® 1 ® nd h ^®'°'° e . d ' 0 tenants on the ground that they had planted it (paragraph 137 above) and that m the remainder the Ruler, Shaikh Ahmad, was entitled only to his personal share amounting to about one-twenty-sixth. It held that under the exchange of letters in 1936 and 1938 it was only the Ruler persona ly to whom tlu nationality requirement introduced by the 1941 amendment of the law (paragraph 37 above) did not apply. 139. In the correspondence with the Iraqi Government in 1936 and 1938 and also in 1941 reference had in fact only been made to the Shaikh of Kuwait s property,' the phrase having been used somewhat carelessly. Accordingly in November 1949 His Majesty s Ambassador at Bagdad wrote to the Iraqi Government pointing out that it was clear from various statements in the correspondence that it concerned all the properties covered by the guarantees given by His Majesty's Government in 1914 and asking them to make it clear to the Court of Cassation, before which the Ruler had lodged an appeal against the July decision, that this was the correct interpretation ot the correspondence. Should the decision of July 1949 to confine the Iraqi guarantee of 1938 to Ahmad be upheld. His Majesty's Government would insist that the same interpretation applied to an undertaking given in the note of 1936 (paragraph 135 above) not to make any claim against the Iraqi Government in respect of any change in the boundaries of the Ruler's land resulting from the land settlement procedure, and that they would accordingly regard their obligations under the guarantee of 1914 to other lineal descendants of Mubarah as having devolved upon the Iraqi Government under Article 8 of the 1930 Treaty (paragraph 132 above). The Iraqi Government sent no written reply to this note but informed His Majesty's Embassy orally in June 1950 that their Legal Committee had decided that it was for the Court of Cassation to interpret the correspondence to which reference had been made. The Court of Cassation gave its judgment in December 1950.( 318 ) By a majority finding, the British presiding Judge dissenting, it rejected the Court of Appeal's decision that one plot was ' mulk ' of the Subah family and referred the matter back for further consideration, it confirmed the tenants in the possession of about one-sixth of the remaining property, and ordered that further evidence should be taken regarding the remaining area in order to determine the extent to which the tenants had acquired usufructuary rights. His Majesty's Embassy wrote to the Iraqi Government to the effect that the judgment was based on an interpretation of the correspondence in 1936 and 1938 to which they could not agree, and that His Majesty's Government considered therefore that their obligations had devolved upon the Iraqi Government. The latter were accordingly invited to agree to discussions in order to assess the compensation due to Mubarak's descendants.C 1 ') The Iraqi Government replied in July 1951 that nothing could be done until the matters which the Court of Cassation had referred back for further consideration had been finally decided.( 320 ) The Court of Appeal for Land Settlement at Basra had reached no decision on these matters by the end of 1953. Hearings had been fixed from time to time but had been postponed, usually owing to the death of some of the numerous tenants concerned in the case. 15^- 1^47 the Political Resident proposed that His Majesty's Government S r 0 1 U i^ ei u deaV0Ur t( ? compound with the Ruler for their release from the guarantee 0 l 19 v. 14 b L P K yln g h ™ about half Rvalue of the gardens. The minimum sum which could be oftered him was in 1949 estimated to be about £400 000 ( 321 ) The proposal remained under consideration for some years and in 1950 w'hen'the Ruler was in much greater danger of losing the bulk of all of the property the Political Resident agreed that it should be dropped. In 1953 after the Ruler raised the question of his date gardens m Iraq during his visit to London for Her Maiesty's Coronation, Her Majesty s Government gave further considpraHnn to this proposal but decided that it would be difficult to justify expenditure! which might Pi Bagdad lo Ra (EA 108 ^ '*».99 then amount to a much larger sum than that originally estimated, without some further attempt to protect the Ruler's interests.( 32 ') They decided therefore that there was no alternative but to let the legal proceedings then pending run their course and to continue with energetic representations to the Iraqi Government. 141. In October 1953, His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad spoke to the Iraqi Prime Minister about the case and said that if the Ruler were not put in possession of his property Her Majesty's Government would hold the Iraqi Government responsible for paying him compensation. The question was poisoning the Ruler's attitude to Iraq and it was therefore of the highest importance that it should be settled without more delay. The Prime Minister suggested some quid pro quo but the Ambassador said he felt sure that the Ruler would not be willing to bargain.( 323 ) 142. Her Majesty's Government have been endeavouring since 1922 to fulfil the pledge they gave to Mubarak in 1914. They have encountered innumerable difficulties and have met with only partial success. They have compounded with the Ruler over the question of the immunity of his property from taxation and have paid him compensation for the loss of the greater part of the Bashiyah estate. Since 1949 the largest of the estates, that at Fao, has been in jeopardy as the result of litigation and although the issue is not yet finally decided it seems likely that substantial compensation will have to be paid to the Ruler by either Her Majesty's Government or the Iraqi Government. Ahmad and Abdullah after him have raised the question of the gardens with the political authorities from time to time, but on the whole have shown remarkable patience, in a matter about which they have, it is believed, felt deeply. Abdullah when he visited Bagdad early in 1952 was urged to take up the matter personally with the Iraqi authorities. It is not known what he said on the subject but all he elicited was a rather vague promise of help (paragraph 123 above). Economically the gardens are now of far less importance to the ruling family than they were before oil was produced, but this consideration is unlikely to dissuade the Ruler from doing his utmost to retain possession of them and from insisting on the full observance by Her Majesty's Government of their undertaking. (c) Saudi Arabia 143. At the opening of the period under review Kuwait was suffering from a Saudi blockade, which had been in force since 1920 and continued until 1940, and from Akhwan raids.( 324 ) The blockade was maintained in order to force Kuwait to come to some agreement about customs and transit dues on goods destined for Saudi Arabia, while the raids were the result of a rebellion against Ibn Saud and his inability at the time to keep his tribes under control. The rebellion continued throughout 1929 with much inter-tribal fighting in Saudi Arabia and much raiding into Kuwait territory. The Ruler refrained from giving any assistance to the rebels but Ibn Saud sent Shaikh Hafiz Wahba to Kuwait to carry on anti-rebel propaganda. The Ruler complained that Hafiz Wahba was acting as a ' Consul ' and the latter was warned by the Political Agent to cease his activities. In 1930 with the collapse of the Akhwan rebellion relations between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia greatly improved so far as raids and frontier incidents were concerned but the blockade continued and in 1931 Ibn Saud maintained it by a patrol of armed motor cars along his frontier, the tribesmen from Najd being forbidden to trade with Kuwait. In 1932 the Political Agent estimated that Kuwait had lost 75 per cent, of her trade as a result of the blockade. In 1933 Ibn Saud wrote to the Ruler asking him to raise his customs duties to the figures in force in Saudi Arabia.( 325 ) The Ruler replied offering to accept a manifest system with posts along the frontier where manifests would be checked. Ibn Saud did not agree to this proposal. In 1935 a conference took place between Saudi and Kuwaiti delegates at Kuwait but broke down because the Saudis held that Kuwait was bound to prevent all smuggling. In 1935 Ibn Saud wrote to the Ruler asking him to agree to follow the ' Arafah law in respect of lost camels.' The Ruler replied accepting the proposal.( 32li ) In 1937 the Saudis officially recognised the export of Saudi goods to Kuwait and permitted a large number of Najdi tribesmen to enter Kuwait for grazing and restocking in the market.

The Extradition AgreemenU covers a number of offences, including smuggling but excluding political offences, and makes special provision for the Neutral Zone. The agreement is accompanied by an exchange of letters dealing with offences against the Irade Agreement. So far as is known the terms of the Extradition Agreement nave never been invoked and nothing has been heard of the frontier officers providea for in the Bon Voisinage Agreement. 146. The questions of the administration of the Neutral Zone, the boundaries between Kuwait, the Neutral Zone and Saudi Arabia and the Saudi claim to certain islands have been dealt with above (sections III to V) and there is little else that calls for notice. In 1938 and 1939 Ibn Saud supported the Ruler against the campaign of vilification from Iraq. In 1944 he asked His Majesty's Government to interfere in favour of the political prisoners detained since the disturbances ot 1938 and 1939. His Majesty's Government refused to interfere, and it is probable that he wrote personally to the Ruler as the prisoners were shortly afterwards all released. In 1948 he objected to the grant of an oil concession to the American Independent Oil Company (paragraph 108 above) without his having been consulted. At the end of 1953 King Saud agreed to lift a prohibition on the export of certain articles from Saudi Arabia to Kuwait, to allow the passage through his territory of motor vehicles carrying fruit and vegetables from Syria to Kuwait and to grant entry visas free of charge to Kuwaitis landing at Dhahran provided that they carried a letter of recommendation from the Ruler.( 334 &gt; 147. Ahmad had close personal relations with Ibn Saud whom he regarded as a big brother, and a number of visits were exchanged between them. Abdullah ( 327 ) l.O. to F.O.

The question of direct correspondence between the Ruler and the King of Saudi Arabia is one on which His Majesty's Government appear to have made no final pronouncement. As the preceding narrative shows such correspondence has in the past been fairly frequent and in 1939 it was agreed that the Ruler while on a visit to Riyadh could discuss informally the agreements which were then being negotiated^'' 5 ) (paragraph 144 above). By 1950, however, the attitude of His Majesty's Government had hardened and they expressed the opinion that the Ruler acted improperly in sending a reply to Ibn Saud's proposals about the administration of the Neutral Zone (paragraph 40 above) without consulting them.( 33l&gt; ) They asked that it should be made clear to the Ruler that as they were responsible for the conduct of his foreign relations, correspondence with other States relating thereto should continue to be conducted through them. The Political Resident called attention to past practice^ 3 !7 ) but no further ruling was given. (d) Persia 148. Persia does not claim Kuwait as Persian territory, but refuses to recognise both her existence as an independent State and Her Majesty's Govern ment's special relations with her.( 338 ) In 1934 the Persian Foreign Minister stated categorically to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran that his Government did not advance any claim to sovereignty over Kuwait, though when he was asked to confirm this in writing, he gave an evasive reply.( l ) ) Under instructions issued in 1928 by the Persian Government, Kuwaitis visiting Persia are to be treated as Persian subjects and supplied with Persian identity certifications or travel documents. In 1932 it was reported that any Kuwaiti going to a Persian port had his Kuwait certificate torn up and was fined. Similarly, any Persian visiting Kuwait had his Persian certificate torn up and was given a Kuwait certificate in which he was shown as a Persian subject. In 1949 Persian identity certificates were recognised at Kuwait, but it was reported that most Persians arrived there without travel documents and that they were allowed to land and remain if security was given for them by a merchant of standing in Kuwait.( 340 ) Kuwait postage stamps are accepted by the Persian post offices, but the Persian authorities refuse to viser passports bearing British visas or endorsements for Kuwait. 149. In 1925 the Persian Government proposed to appoint a Persian subject residing in Kuwait as an honorary agent for the issue of Persian passports.( 51J ) They were informed that such an appointment would be contrary to the 1899 agree- ment( 342 ) and would create an embarrassing precedent. They then asked that British protection should be extended to Persian nationals in Kuwait. The Ruler, when consulted, objected to the proposal but the Political Agent was instructed to deal with each case, where protection was needed, as it arose and that no further intimation need be made to the Ruler on the subject.( ) There is no case on record of the Political Agents having extended protection to Persian nationals and it is doubtful whether such a course of action would ordinarily be possible now. 150. Except for occasional minor incidents little has occurred during the period under review affecting relations between Kuwait and Persia. There is much cind going between the two countries and a certain amount of trade, much of it illicit on the'Persian side. In 1929 the Persians alleged that arms were being supplied from Kuwait to the C)ashqai rebels but the accusation was easily refuted. In 1932 a request received from the Persian Government for the service of a judicial document on the Ruler of Kuwait was refused.( 344 ) In the following year two requests for the service of similar documents on persons resident in Kuwait were refused ' until the relations between Persia and Kuwait have been regularised.'( 345 ) In 1932 and 1933 four cases of interference by the Persians with Kuwaiti dhows ( 335 ) Tel from P.O. to Jedda. 94 of June 9, 1939 (EA 4142/34/25 of 1939).

A reply was sent to the Persian Government that masters who had business in Khurramshahr would be advised to explain their grievances to the Persian naval authorities there but that His Majesty's Government could not agree that such action should be regarded as an essential preliminary for the obtaining of redress.( 3 ') Further cases of interference with dhows from Kuwait and other Shaikhdoms occurred and eventually, at the suggestion of His Majesty's Ambassador at Teheran and with the approval of His Majesty's Government, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, discussed all the cases direct with the Persian Admiral at Khurramshahr and in 1950 obtained the restitution of a substantial quantity of arms and money, the bulk of which had been taken from JCuwait dhows.( 353 ) Since then no further cases of interference by the Persians with Kuwaiti dhows appear to have been reported. 153. In 1949 the Persians erected a marker on Farsi Island which had been claimed for Kuwait by His Majesty's Government. It was removed by one of His Majesty's ships (paragraph 66 above). 154. In 1949 the Ruler, without consulting the local political authorities, granted permission to Iranian Airways to use the Kuwait airfield( 354 ) (paragraphs 182 and 185 below). 155. There are many Persians in Kuwait. Those permanently resident have mostly adopted Arab dress and are not easily distinguishable from the local Arabs. Although there have been rumours from time to time of the presence of Tudeh agents, the Persians in Kuwait have been law-abiding and have siven little or no trouble and their appears to be no Sunni-Shiah friction.

During discussions with the Government of India in 1948 and 1949 it was agreed that the Indian Consul at Basra when appointed should be permitted to carry out normal consular functions in respect of Kuwait, without any exequatur being granted, on the understanding that all representations to the Ruler would be made through the Political Agent, although there would be no objection to his corresponding on matters of a routine nature direct with the appropriate departments of the Kuwait Government^ 355 ) The Ruler was consulted and agreed to this arrangement.! i5r ') In 1950 the Government of India proposed as an interim measure that a Secretary from their Legation at Bagdad should visit Kuwait instead of their Consul from Basra.( 357 ) This proposal was accepted but His Majesty's Government stipulated that the Secretary should have no direct access to the Ruler or his authorities but would make all representations, even on routine matters, through the Political Agent. This arrangement is still in force and has worked satisfactorily. A Secretary from the Indian Legation at Bagdad has visited Kuwait once or twice every year and has been careful to observe the conditions on which such visits have been permitted. 157. At the end of 1953 there were about 3,000 Indians resident in Kuwait territory. Only a few Indian shop-keepers have been permitted to set up business and the Ruler is very reluctant to add to their number. A substantial number of Indians are employed by the Kuwait Oil Company and on works in Kuwait town. In August 1948 there was a fairly serious strike by the oil company's Indian and Pakistani employees. They produced a number of grievances some of which were justified and steps were taken to remedy them. A few months later an Indian Good-will Mission visited Kuwait( 35S ) (Chapter 2, paragraph 94). They made a few complaints about the oil company's treatment of their Indian employees but found the state of alfairs much better than the Indian press had led them to expect. In December 1953 there was a strike of the Kuwait Government's Indian and Pakistani employees in Kuwait town over a comparatively trivial matter. The Kuwait Government dismissed all the strikers, but after a few had been repatriated the remainder agreed to return to work and were reinstated. 158. In recent years there has been much smuggling of gold from Kuwait into India.( 359 ) There are no restrictions on the export of gold from Kuwait and the Government of India have realised that it is necessary for them to take steps to stop the smuggling at their end and appear to have made no formal representations on the subject though they have discussed it with United Kingdom High Commissioner at New Delhi.( 3G0 ) The Reserve Bank of India has from time to time demanded particulars of the source of origin of rupee notes repatriated from the Gulf and has threatened to refuse such repatriation unless it can be shown that the notes have not been obtained by the illicit sale of gold. (/) Pakistan 159. The question of Pakistani representation in Kuwait was not raised until January 1953 when in a discussion at the Foreign Office the Pakistan Secretary for External Affairs enquired whether Her Majesty's Government's offer of the appointment of a Trade Agent made in respect of Bahrain (Chapter 2, paragraph 98) applied also to Kuwait.( 3(il ) He added that the Pakistan Government would prefer a Consular official. The objections to a Consular official were explained to him and all tliol he was told that there would be no objection to the appointment of a Pakistan 0 Trade Agent at Kuwait on the same conditions as those proposed for Bahrain, nor to periodical visits by a Pakistan Consular representative from Bagdad or Dhahran without exequatur. In 1952 the Pakistan Government proposed that their Minister at Bagdad should visit Kuwait. This proposal was accepted but the visit was not paid until May 1953. As a result of it the Pakistan Government proposed that their Vice-Consul at Basra should pay periodic visits to Kuwait.f 302 ) This proposal was accepted by Her Majesty's Government and the first of such visits was paid in December 1953.

Only a few do business in Kuwait but a substantial number are empbyed, mostly as artisans, by the Kuwait Oil Company and on work m August oil company's Pakistanis were involved m a strike which to p 1948 and those employed by the Kuwait Government in the town in one which took place in December 1953 (paragraph 157 above). On the latter occasion the strikers refused to accept the mediation of the Pakistani Vice-Consul Basra who was on a visit to Kuwait at the time. (g) The Lebanon and Syria 161. There is close association between Kuwait and these two countries. Kuwait is supplied with fruit from them and many Kuwaitis including some o e leading Shaikhs spend summer holidays in them. In 1948 an inlormal arrangemen was made direct between Kuwait and the Lebanon whereby Kuwaitis visiting the latter country by car would be given visas on arrival.(' ) In 1952 another mtormai arrangement was arrived at by Kuwait with the Lebanon and Syria lor the mutua. abolition of visa requirements. Her Majesty's Government were not consulted and Her Majesty's Ambassadors at Beirut and Damascus were asked to intorm the Governments to which thev were accredited that Her Majesty's Government had agreed on behalf of the Ruler of Kuwait that Lebanese and Syrian nationals should not require visas to enter Kuwait and to request confirmation of the fact that in addition to abolishing visa fees for Kuwaitis the Lebanese and Syrian Governments had waived the requirement that Kuwaitis should obtain visas in order to enter their countries.( 364 ) No official confirmation of this had been obtained by the end of 1953, and it was reported so far as the Lebanon was concerned that Kuwaitis wishing to enter the country had to obtain visas but were always able to obtain them free of charge at the frontier or airport subject to the usual security checks^™ 5 ) At the end of 1953 the Lebanese Government expressed a desire to open a Lebanese Consulate in Kuwait.( 366 ) The Ruler said he left the matter entirely in the hands of Her Majesty's Government and the request was refused. 162. The trouble created by the unauthorised use of the Kuwait airfield by the Lebanese Middle East Airlines in 1950 and 1951 is narrated elsewhere (paragraph 183 below). Reports received from time to time that the Kuwait Government had agreed to grant financial assistance to the Syrian Government have not been confirmed. (h) United States of America 163. In 1948 the United States Embassy in London enquired whether His Majesty's Government would be agreeable to the establishment of a United States Consulate at Kuwait. A reply was sent suggesting that the United States Consul at Basra should perform Consular functions in Kuwait on an informal basis and without exequatur^ 307 ) The American Embassy returned to the charge a year later and said that their Consul at Basra had been endeavouring to perform consular service for the large American community at Kuwait, but the arrangement was inherently incapable of working satisfactorily. His Majesty's Government resisted the proposal as long as possible and stipulated certain conditions the acceptance of which they regarded as essential before it could be agreed to. The Ruler when approached on the subject of the presence of foreign Consuls in Kuwait generally deprecated the proposal but made it clear that he would not object strongly to the presence of an American Consul.( 36K ) 164. In 1951 the United States Government accepted the conditions which had been proposed by His Majesty's Government and their proposal to appoint a Consul at Kuwait was accepted. The conditions referred to were as follows; — ' (i) The exequatur will be issued by the King. (ii) The Consul will have no right of direct access to the Shaikh. P 63 ) C.R.O. to F.O.

Routine matters are defined as— (a) trade enquiries and information; (b) transmission of general information material; (c) condolences and congratulations. On these matters the Consul will correspond with the Shaikh's Secretary.'( 36&lt;J ) His Majesty's Government agreed that the Consul might have access to the Ruler on certain occasions provided all such interviews were arranged by the Political Agent, who would himself be present. The Ruler concurred in the conditions and in the issue by himself of a letter of authority (Appendix J), a point on which the Americans had insisted. The Consul arrived in Kuwait on June 28 and was presented to the Ruler three days later. In his commission his appointment was stated to be for ' Kuwait and its prescribed district ' and the United States Embassy in London confirmed that this was meant to include the Neutral Zone.( 370 ) They stated that their Embassy in Jedda would in due course be obtaining Ibn Saud's consent to the Consul's exercising his functions in the Zone. 165. The appointment did not, as had been expected, lead to demands for similar representation by other States. A Vice-Consul was in due course added to the Consul's staff with Her Majesty's Government's approval. On one occasion in 1952 the Consul made direct enquiries from the Kuwait Municipality on the subject of roads, and on the Ruler's complaining the Consul apologised to the Political Agent.( 371 ) Apart from this the Consulate has strictly observed the conditions prescribed for it, and its behaviour so far as Her Majesty's Government are concerned has up to date been impeccable and its relations with the Political Agency have been excellent. 166. Although the Americans own a half interest in the Kuwait Oil Company and the whole of the American Independent Oil Company the number of Americans employed in Kuwait does not amount to more than about a hundred A Mission of the Dutch American Reformed Church of America has done excellent medical work over many years. United States ships visit Kuwait from time to time and between 1948 and 1953 a United States Navy Survey Ship earned out a hydrographic survey of Kuwait waters. VIII.—Miscellaneous (a) Jurisdiction 167 The first Kuwait Order in Council came into force on October 1, 1925.( ) Under it jurisdiction over British subjects and P ro t ec ^ eoL^ed to^the protected persons of non-Muslim foreign Governments who had consen^ exercise of such jurisdiction by His Majesty, an p 0 )iti C al Agency as being ot ..he, Muslim Go.—, S i; flits' hi-, non-Muslim Power committing an ' n ce r ' ■f^^Udings the matter should at or of such a person beoming , Government who, on learning that once be brought to the notice ^ from the Government of the such a case had ansen would take step ^ ^ ^ ^ u person concerned caS es were tried under this Order in Council, the Order in Council.

No dispute wUh the Ru er over jurisdictional matters appears to have^ arisen. , , . r h f u- suggested that jurisdiction over Indians and Pakistanis should be trans erred o him but he did not pursue the matter when the suggestion was negatived. A new Order in Council was issued on March 29, 1949, to introduce a number of amendments which had been made necessary by the transfer of power m ndia and certain shanges in the constitution of the Courts. It was not shown to the Ruler before issue. 169. 'Kuwait subject' had been defined in the 1935 and 1949 Orders in Council as meaning ' a subject of the Shaikh of Kuwait and any person, not being a British subject, who is a national of any other Muslim State. Towards the end of Ahmad's reign a difference of opinion arose with the Ruler whether the Lebanon was or was not a Muslim State and doubts on this subject enhanced the dimculty of taking action against a Lebanese air line for its unauthorised use of the Kuwait airfield in 1950 and 1951 (paragraph 184 below). The Political Resident was instructed to endeavour to persuade the Ruler to agree to the names af the Muslim countries whose nationals would be subject to his jurisdiction being specified, and His Majesty's Government raised no objection to the Lebanon s being included amongst these.( 374 ) Accordingly in January 1952 the Political Agent wrote to the Ruler proposing that the clause referred to should be replaced by another defining his jurisdiction as covering nationals of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Persia, Syria, Egypt, the Lebanon, the Yemen, Muscat and Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial States and stateless Muslims of Palestinian origin^ 37 ') The Ruler accepted the proposal in writing (Appendix K (iv) and (v)). A new Order in Council embodying this and other changes came into force on September 1, 1953. It does not appear to have been shown to the Ruler before its issue. 170. In 1952 as a result of Sir Eric Beckett's visit to the Persian Gulf the Political Resident was instructed to take every opportunity of obtaining the Ruler's agreement to the appointment of a British Judicial (or Legal) Adviser and to take up with him the question of making provision in a new Order in Council, which was then under consideration, for the establishment of Joint Courts.( :i7r&gt; ) All attempts to persuade him to employ a British Legal Adviser failed (paragraph 36 above) and not only did he refuse to entertain the idea of Joint Courts but he suggested that all mixed cases should be tried in the Kuwait Courts. In consequence no mention of Joint Courts was made in the 1953 Order in Council. 171. Under powers granted by the Orders in Council the Political Resident has issued Regulations on a number of subjects and also Rules of Court, Legal Practitioners Rules and Criminal and Civil Appeal Rules. Owing to the refusal of the Kuwait authorities to co-operate in legislative matters the only local laws, other than the Air Navigation Regulations (paragraphs 178 and 183 below), which have been enforced by Regulation are the Mina al Ahmadi Port Regulation( 7 ) (paragraph 93 above) and the Kuwait Income Tax Decreed 78 ) (paragraph 98 above). These were drafted by His Majesty s Government and apply primarily to the Kuwait Oil Company, Kuwaitis being little affected by the former Regulation and not at all by the latter. 172. The question of the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty's Government in the Neutral Zone was raised in 1950 after the American Independent Oil Company had begun operations there, when it was ruled that the Order in Council of 1949 could not be held as applying to the Zone ( 379 ) It was specifically excluded from the operation of the Order in Council of 1953 but power was granted to the Political Resident to make the Order applicable to it by a C 3 ') l.O. toF.O.

It is unlikely that it will be possible to issue such a Regulation until agreement has been reached with the Saudis regarding the exercise of jurisdiction m the Zone. Proposals have been formulated on the subject but not yet presented to the Saudis (paragraph 41 above). Meanwhile no case appears to have arisen wmch wouid call for the exercise in the Zone of the jurisdiction ceded to Her Majesty by the Ruler. ib) Facilities for the Royal Air Force 173. Kuwait was visited by the Royal Air Force from time to time from 1920 onwards and on occasions up to and including 1928 they assisted in the defence of Kuwait against raiders.( iM, ) In 1932 and 1933 a ground survey of Kuwait was carried out by an officer of the 'Royal Engineers attached to the Royal Air Force Headquarters in Iraq. In 1934, at the time of the signing of the Civil Air Agreement (paragraph 178 below), letters were exchanged whereby the Ruler accorded to the Royal Air Force priority in the use of any aerodromes in Kuwait without prior permission and without any charge being made. Reference is also made to the import of aviation fuel for the use of the Royal Air Force free of customs duty. The Ruler called attention to the fact that the Ruler of Bahrain received an annual rental from the Royal Air Force and suggested that he should receive the same treatment. In the same year the Political Agent negotiated with the Ruler for the lease of land at Bandar Shuwaikh for the use of the Royal Air Force but agreement could not be reached regarding the terms and the matter was dropped. The Ruler did, however, agree to loan to the Royal Air Force indefinitely without rent landing grounds at Jahrah and Subaihiyah provided the water rights of the nomad population were not interfered with( 381 ) and also gave them permission to lay mooring buoys in the Bandar Shuwaikh anchorage subject to certain conditions.( !S2 ) 174. The Royal Air Force made use of Kuwait during the last war and in 1940 prepared the airfield south of the town, which was still in use in 1953. In 1944 they established detachments in Kuwait and were allowed to occupy buildings at Shuwaikh rent free. They withdrew after the war. 175. When a new Civil Air Agreement was signed in June 1949 (paragraph 181 below) a fresh exchange of letters took place with the Ruler by which the same facilities were accorded to the Royal Air Force as those specified in 1934, except that there is mention of exemption from custom duties.( 383 ) An identical exchange of letters (Appendix L (i) and (ii)) took place after the signing of the 1950 Civil Air Agreement (paragraph 183 below). 176. When Ahmad died in January 1950 the Royal Air Force held armoured cars in readiness to intervene in case the succession was disputed and^ internal fighting broke out. They participated in the celebi ations on Abdullah s formal accession that year and on the occasion of the presentation to him ot the insignia of the K.C.M.G. in 1952. l\ F o ^ pz 1400/34 of February 28, 1934 (E 1361 /160/91 of 1934). » i n In F O PZ 6022/34 ot September 27, 1934 (E 6035/160/91 of t934).

In 1932 Imperial Airways agreed to call at Kuwait if inducement offered and conditions permitted and the Ruler agreed to waive for the time being his right to charge landing -fees.f') In December of the same year Imperial Airways arranged to make regular calls at Kuwait. In 1933 at the instance of His Majesty s Government the Ruler prohibited the flying over or landing in Kuwait territory of private aircraft^ 38 ') 178 The first Civil Air Agreement was signed on May 23, 1934, for a period of four vears after which it was renewable at the option of His Majesty's Government and with the concurrence of the Ruler.C 8 ') It granted His Majesty's Government exclusive rights to establish and maintain as his agents an aerodrome or aerodromes within the Ruler's territory. For these rights and for the lease of108 the aerodrome the Ruler was to be paid £500 a ^ ear ' hp , e r^ r b^is^of accompanied by Air Navigation a Lrm of authorisation for conditions governing the use ot the aerodrome, oy a „ . f , . aircraft to land in and fly over Kuwait, by a sc ^ eciul&lt; r av Vorro His Maiestv's exchange of letters relating to facilities for the Royal Ai • . j ^ . Government appointed Imperial Airways as a ^ n ir ^t e A ? fneHal maintaining the civil aerodrome at Kuwait and the Ru er g P authorisation for the aircraft of that company to land in an y In May 1936 a King's Regulation^ 87 ) was issued enforcing the Air Navigation Regulations against persons subject to the Order in Council an pena lsm g olfence against them. In 1937 the Ruler agreed that in an emergency p la Airways flying boats might land near the Royal Air Force moorings at Bandar Shuwaikh (paragraph 173 above). In 1938 the 1934 Agreement was renewed or a further period of seven years without any revision of its terms.! ) Ruler, after first refusing, agreed orally that the British Overseas Airways Corporation might put down mooring buoys in the Bandar Shuwaikh anchorage. In 1945 the 1934 Agreement was renewed for a further period of three years, a definition of the term ' aerodrome ' being added to it.( ) In 1946 the Ruler granted to His Majesty's Government the right to grant on his behall the use ot aerodromes and traffic rights to foreign aircraft. 179. After the last war the Kuwait Oil Company were persuaded to take over the maintenance of the airfield which the Royal Air Force had established south of the town (paragraph 174 above) on an informal basis primarily for their own use. In 1947 His Majesty's Government permitted Iraqi Airways to operate a service to Kuwait on the basis of an agreement which they had reached with the company. The Iraqi Government were informed thatHis Majesty's Government do not at present intend to designate Kuwait aerodrome for the operation of international air services.'( 390 ) Syrian Airways were also permitted informally to establish a service to Kuwait for a period of six months. Landing fees were collected from the aircraft of the two lines, but not from those of the Kuwait Oil Company, by the Political Agency.^ 91 ) Early in 1948, with the Ruler's concurrence, British Overseas Airways Corporation flying-boats began to call regularly at Kuwait. 180. The 1934 Agreement as renewed was due to expire on May 23, 1948. In the early months of the year there was much discussion about a proposal of the Kuwait Oil Company to construct a new airfield for their own purposes and the possibility of His Majesty's Government's contributing the extra expenditure required to bring it up to international standards was considered, together with a proposal that the Company should act as His Majesty's Government's agents under the Agreement. The Ruler was asked orally to agree to a six months' extension of the Agreement in order to allow time for a revision of the terms of the Air Navigation Regulations to bring them into line with His Majesty's Government's obligations under the Chicago Convention. He agreed to the proposed extension but expressed a hope that this would not involve delay in the decision to construct a new airfield.( 392 ) He was informed in writing that there would be no such delay and replied confirming his agreement to the extension. The agreement finally expired on November 23, 1948, without any proposal having been made to the Ruler for a further extension or for a new agreement and without any decision having been reached about the construction of a new airfield. Instructions for negotiating a new agreement were despatched to the Political Resident in December and in January 1949 the Ruler agreed that, pending the negotiations, the existing arrangements concerning civil aviation should be regarded as continuing in force unofficially. ( 3 9 3 ) 181. The new Civil Air Agreement was eventually signed on June 21, 1949.( 394 ) It conferred on His Majesty's Government exclusive rights to establish and operate aerodromes and ancillary facilities in Kuwait and authority to grant on behalf of (387) ]^T 0 1 of 1936. f 88 ) I.O. to P.O.

It was for a period of 10 years and was renewable at the option of His Majesty's Government with the concurrence ol the Ruler. A sum of £1,000 a year was payable to the Ruler for the lease of aerodromes and for the privileges granted. Revised Air Navigation Regulations and Conditions covering the use of aerodromes were annexed to the agreement. On June 29 the Political Agent wrote to the Ruler confirming that His Majesty's Government in maintaining and operating aerodromes and ancillary facilities in Kuwait would be acting on his behalf.( 395 ) On the same day letters were exchanged with the Ruler regarding facilities for the Royal Air Force. 182. Throughout 1949 the activities of foreign air lines at Kuwait caused much concern. Middle East Airlines, a Lebanese company, operated charter services with a degree of regularity that amounted almost to a scheduled service,( 3i&gt;(1 ) and it was not until they had been doing this for some time that their agent applied to the Political Agent for permission to use the airfield. The Ruler granted oral permission to Iranian Airways to use the airfield, and it was only when they applied to him for written confirmation of this that he referred the matter to the Political Agent.C' 7 ) The head of the company in Teheran was subsequently told by the British Civil Air Attache that he must apply to the British authorities for permission to operate a service to Kuwait. The Swissair and Pan American Airways lines were reported to be making unauthorised scheduled stops at Kuwait. An application by Trans World Air Lines, after a direct approach to the Ruler, for permission to operate services was refused on the ground that the airfield was not up to the standard required for their aircraft. An application from Trans-Ocean Airlines was similarly refused. The Dutch K.L.M. were also making enquiries. At the end of the year a decision was reached to appoint a representative of the Ministry of Civil Aviation at Kuwait to assist in dealing with these activities and other civil aviation problems. The officer selected took up his appointment early in 1950 and was furnished with detailed terms of reference.( 398 ) 183. In April 1950 the Ruler agreed to an amendment of Article 5 of the Civil Air Agreement.! 399 ) Subsequently when a number of further amendments to the agreement and to the regulations attached to it were proposed he insisted on a completely new agreement. It was decided to comply with his wishes and the new Civil Air Agreement was signed on September 5, 1950.( 400 ) It was to remain in force until the date of expiry of the 1949 agreement, viz., June 21, 1959, and was renewable on the same conditions. The Air Navigation Regulations annexed to the agreement contained a new provision for the detention of aircraft contravening them. The Agreement was accompanied by exchanges of letters regarding the fact that His Majesty's Government would be acting on the Ruler's behalf, and facilities for the Roval Air Force, identical with those which followed the 1949 agreement (paragraph 181 above). After the new Air Navigation Regulations had been promulgated by the Ruler they were applied to persons subject to the Order in Council and to all property and aircraft to which the Order applied, by a King's Regulation.C 101 ) The Ruler appointed the Ministry of Civil Aviation representative to perform the functions of ' authorised person under them. 184 The way was now clear for plans to be made to put a stop to the unauthorised landings of Middle East Airlines and another Lebanese company by the detention of their aircraft. Numerous difficulties however arose. Not only was there some doubt whether the Lebanese came under His M^ajesty s or the Ruler's jurisdiction (paragraph 169 above) but if it became necessary to take forcible action the Kuwait police would have to be employed and the Ruler was frightened of the unpopularity in which this might involve him. In February 1951 the companies' agents in Kuwait were threatened with action under the Air Navigation Regulations and warned that no further flights should be made until His Maiestv's Government's permission for the services had been obtained through the Lebanese Go vernm cn t ('*) This had no effect on Middle East Airlines, although the other company ceased its operations. At the end of February His Majesty's Minister at Beirut made an oral approach to the Lebanese Ministry of Foreign ^395 /396 1 PR to F O Despatch 61 of August 16. 1949 (W 4669/15/802 of 1949).

The date for taking action was n 7 tu. a further communication on the subject was made to the Ruler. i P e head of Middle East Airlines informed the Political Agent that an application for permission to fly to Kuwait had been prepared and would be handed to the Lebanese Foreign Ministry for delivery to His Majesty s Legation. Inis ed to tne postponement of action but no application was received by His Majesty s ega ion. Further dates for action were proposed and postponed for one reason or another and eventually on May 8 His Majesty's Legation received a note Irom the Lebanese Foreign Ministry asking for permission for Middle East Airlines to land at Kuwait and to convey passengers and goods between the two countries.( ) Permission was granted for two months only during which the Lebanese Government were invited to conclude a general Air Agreement with His Majesty s Government.! ) An agreement was concluded accordingly in August 1951 and Middle East Airlines have since been operating regular services between Beirut and Kuwait. At the beginning of 1952 it became necessary to complain of their carrying out a number of unauthorised charter flights to Kuwait and they promised not to offend further in this manner. 185. The Ruler in the course of the conversations about Middle East Airlines called attention to the fact that Iranian Airways were operating without permission. He was told that there was no objection to this as a bilateral Air Agreement with Iran was under discussion. His Majesty's Government had in fact orally informed the Persian Government that the line might operate to Kuwait, the concession being made as part of a mutual exchange of operating rights in the territories of the two parties.( 40&lt;i ) 186. In 1948 when Ahmad had been asked to agree to a six months' extension of the Civil Air Agreement he had been told in writing that this would not involve delay in the decision to construct a new airfield (paragraph 180 above). Although the language in the communication made to him was ambiguous he was under the impression that His Majesty's Government had given a definite promise.( 107 ) His Majesty's Government and the Kuwait Oil Company were unable to reach agreement about the incidence of the expenditure involved in the project and for this and other reasons no action was taken. The Company eventually contented themselves with obtaining permission for the construction of a landing strip at Ahmadi for emergency use only.( 40s ) Abdullah after his accession showed no particular enthusiasm for a new airfield( 409 ) and the position eventually reached was that it would only be necessary to construct one when the existing one began to interfere with the development of the town. At the end of 1951 it was decided to improve the existing airfield without saying anything to the Ruler on the subject. In 1952 it was expected that town development would necessitate the construction of a new airfield in two years' time and the Political Resident was instructed to ascertain whether the Ruler would be willing to pay for its construction. When approached he made it clear that he expected that ultimately there would be a new airfield at the site previously selected, viz., Mishrif, and that in his opinion it was financially the responsibility of Her Majesty's Government to construct it, the Kuwait Government's contribution being to provide the land at a rental of £1,000 a year as previouslv.( 410 ) Later in the year the Ruler decided to provide a semi-permanent passenger building at the existing airfield. The local political authorities had prooosed that he should be told that under existing circumstances it is out of the Question that Her Majesty's Government provide the funds for the construction of a new airport' but the Political Resident was instructed to make an oral statement to him on these lines only when he reopened the question^ 111 ) During the year the Air Ministry considered paying for the construction of a new airfield at Kait! prim^ffy for ( 403 ) Beirut to F.O. 13827/79/51 of March 20, 1951 (GA 59/70 of 19sn ( 404 ) Tel. from Beirut to F.O. 253 of May 8, 1953 (GA 57/29 of 1953) ( 405 ) Beirut to F.O.

The Development Board did not support his proposal, and the Ruler did not raise the question when he returned to Kuwait. When a Ministry of Civil Aviation Mission visited Kuwait in the spring of 1953 they reported that Hasted had told them that it would be at least five or six years before the expansion of Kuwait town would be likely to prejudice the safety of the approaches to the existing airfield. He had however submitted to the Kuwait Government an estimate of £5 million for a new airfield. The Mission were of opinion that no action should be taken to awaken the question of a new airfield, and that when the Kuwaitis raised it again an arrangement should be made whereby Her Majesty's Government would provide the technical essentials and the Kuwait Government the amenities including a paved runway. They hoped that Her Majesty's Government would then be in a strong position to resist any demands that operational control of the aerodrome and control of traffic rights should be relinquished to the Ruler.( n;! ) It may be noted that the possibility of such demands was the main argument against asking the Kuwait Government to pay the cost of a new airfield. Although the Ministry of Civil Aviation saw no great harm in relinquishing these rights at Kuwait, they feared that should this be done similar demands might be made elsewhere in the Gulf where they considered it important to retain them.( 414 ) The position at the end of the period under review was that the question of a new airfield was dormant, the Kuwait Oil Company was still with some reluctance maintaining the existing airfield. Her Majesty's Government were providing radio facilities and were managing the airfield and the Kuwait Government were providing limited amenities. 187. From 1949 onwards a number of companies proposed to establish a local airline at Kuwait with or without Kuwaiti participation.i 41 ) Most of these projects came to nothing. In 1951 Bosworth (chapter 2, paragraph 126) formed in London a Gulf Aviation (Kuwait) Company in which his Bahrain company held 51 per cent, of the shares and two Kuwaiti merchants the remainder. Bosworth was killed shortly after and the company never functioned. In 1952 Izzat Jaafar (paragraph 12 above) proposed to start a Kuwaiti air line probably with American participation, but subsequently appears to have lost interest in the idea.( ) The proposal however made Fler Majesty's Government anxious to ensure that it any local line were formed there should be British paiticipation in it. In April 1953 Skyways Limited took over for a nominal sum the interest which the Britisn Overseas Airwavs Corporation had acquired in Gulf Aviation (Kuwait) with a view to establishing a local air line,( 11 ') and the Ministry of Civil Aviation Mission after its visit to Kuwait recommended that this project should be encouraged. The British Overseas Airways Corporation unexpectedly decided to try to form a line themselves and entered into negotiations with Kuwaiti merchants \ At the same time Abdullah al Mubarak was reported to be in touch with an American company, and a British firm to be negotiating with Lebanese interests with a similar object in view. Meanwhile an aviation company was floated in Kuwait by the pnncipa merchants and considerable capital was subscribed. This company negotiate wrt J both the British Overseas Airways Corporation and Skyways, Limited and decided to associate itself with the former, and in September the Ruler informed the Poll ical Agent in writing of the formation in this manner of the Kuwait National Airline Limited ' and asked him to obtain the agreement of the Lebanon Syria Iraq and Bahrain to the landing of the company's aircraft in their territories.( By the end of 1953 the agreement between the Kuwaiti company and the British Overseas Airways Corporation had not been signed It appeared that all the capital for the airlines was to be provided by the Kuwaitis and that the British Overseas Airways Corporation were be given a contract for one year only in the first place, their Mi2\ p q to P R Despatch 88 of June 5, 1952 (GA 57/29 G of 19^52).

In June 1952 with the approval of the Ruler the landing fees payable at the Kuwait airfield were enhanced.( 122 ) Iraqi Airways refused to pay the revised fees and the Iraqi Director-General of Civil Aviation protested in writing regarding them on the ground that they were out of proportion to the facilities offered. Eventually it was agreed to grant a rebate of one-third of the fees in respect of aircraft operating from a point of departure not more than 100 miles from Kuwait with effect from October 1, 1952.( 423 ) 189. In July 1952 the Ministry of Civil Aviation replaced their representative at Kuwait with an Aerodrome Manager to whom detailed general instructions were issued.( 424 ) In November 1953 a Mr. Mustafa Sadek, an Egyptian, informed the Aerodrome Manager that he had been appointed Director of Civil Aviation by the Kuwait Government.( 425 ) ft was subsequently explained to the Political Agent that Mutafa Sadek's duties were of a social nature. He later visited the United Kingdom to purchase aircraft for a flying club which it was proposed to form at Kuwait and to obtain expert advice about running it.( 42G ) {d) Slavery 190. There is no treaty between Kuwait and Her Majesty's Government regarding the suppression of the slave trade. In 1935 the Political Agent reported that the import of slaves into Kuwait had entirely ceased since the Akhwan Rebellion in Saudi Arabia of 1929 and 1930. The Ruler had not only stamped out the sale of new slaves however secretly imported but had for a long time been the protector of slaves born in slavery who could at any time get assistance and justice from him. At that time only the nobility and leading families kept slaves and these were all the descendants of slaves born in captivity and were treated as trusted members of the household.( 427 ) In 1949 the Head of the Public Security Department issued a notice forbidding the import of and traffic in slaves (Appendix M). In 1952 the Ruler informed the Political Resident that for many years the buying and selling of slaves had been prohibited, that any slave who asked for his freedom was given it and that slavery was not recognised by the Kuwait Courts. He admitted that there was still a number of slaves in Kuwait but said that they could obtain their liberty whenever they wished to do so.( 428 ) 191. In 1952 the Ruler complained of the embarrassment caused to him by requests from the Saudis for the return of slaves who had escaped to Kuwait and asked that representations on the subject should be made at Jedda.( t29 ) Her Majesty's Ambassador accordingly wrote to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that Her Majesty's Government could not approve of attempts to recover slaves who had run away to territories under their protection and that they were advising the Rulers of the Gulf States to resist such attempts. A reply was received that the Saudi Arabian Government could take no action because no specific case had been quoted which could be enquired into. As the main purpose of the representations had been to make it easier for the Rulers to resist Saudi demands for the return of runaway slaves the matter was not pursued further ( 430 ) The Ruler was informed of the action taken.

In 1900 the Ruler gave an undertaking! 131 ) to prohibit the traffic of arms in Kuwait territory and issued a proclamation accordingly, together with a proclamation granting British and Persian warships the right to search Kuwaiti vessels for arms and ammunition (Appendix N (i) and (ii)). In the Historical Summary of Events for 1907 to 1928 it was reported that Ahmad, since his accession^ had actively co-operated with His Majesty's Government in the suppression of the arms traffic.C 132 ) In 1929 the Persians complained of arms smuggling from Kuwait but their allegations were refuted (paragraph 150 above). The Iraqi complaints about smuggling from Kuwait between 1930 and 1940 (paragraph 119 above) included allegations about the large-scale smuggling of arms and exhaustive enquiries were made into the matter between 1937 and 1939. The Political Resident reported that there was no traffic in arms from Kuwait to Iraq, that there appeared to be a brisk trade in arms from Saudi Arabia to Iraq, and that this trade did not pass through Kuwait.( i3:1 ) It was conceded that an occasional rifle might be purchased by Iraqi tribesmen in Kuwait territory, but there was no general market for arms in Kuwait town as the sale of rifles there was prohibited and no nomad could bring a rifle into the town without a written permit, which was only given when the rifle was in need of repair.( 434 ) In view of this report it was agreed that further enquiries need not be made until the Iraqi Government produced detailed evidence in support of their allegations.( 435 ) 193. In 1941 and 1942 reports were received from the Persian Government and other sources that Qashqai and other tribesmen were purchasing arms and ammunition from Kuwait.( 436 ) These reports appear to have been well-founded. A Qashqai emissary sent for the purchase of arms was arrested in Kuwait and the Persian Prime Minister asked that his thanks should be conveyed to the British authorities for their action.C ') A small consignment of arms purchased on the Trucial Coast was also seized at Kuwait. The Ruler informed the Political Agent that he had taken strict measures against any possible smuggling of arms into Persia or Iraq and that all arms and ammunition in the possession of Kuwaitis had been registered and licences issued for them.C s ) 194. In 1951 the Political Resident reported that a large number of shot-guns were being imported into Kuwait, some or them probably without No Objection Certificates (Chapter 1, paragraph 42). He leared that some of these might be smu^^led into Iraq or Persia for subversive purposes.( ) His Majesty s Ambassador at Bagdad reported that members oi the Iraqi Government complained from time to time that the measures taken in Kuwait to prevent the smuggling oi arms into Iraq appeared to be inadequate.^') An approach was made to the Ruler who denied that shot-guns were being smuggled into Iraq and Persia and said that they were only being exported openly to Saudi Arabia.C') Abdn lah al Mubarak, the Director of Public 'Security, stated that shot-guns could only be bought in Kuwait by persons holding a permit from his department or the Political Agent, that retailers were required to keep exact records of their stocks and that sales were checked from time to time. The issue of permits to Iraqis and Persians was forbidden Snap checks amongst the nomads were carried out from time to time and onlv one case of the re-sale of a shot-gun to an Iraqi had come to notice. Any persons wishing to import shot-guns were still applying to the Political Agency for No Objection Certificates. In these circumstances it was considered that no further action was necessary.

Early in 1952 the Ruler announced that he had decided to accede to the request of a number of local merchants and to permit the opening of a Kuwait National Bank under a charter for himself.C') He ar S ue ^ that ^ ls 'g 1 ? ^ of his agreement with the Imperial Bank of Iran as that did not pieclude the formation of a local bank but only the opening of a branch bank. Both Her Majesty's Government and the British Bank of Iran and tne Middle East, as the Imperial Bank of Iran was then called, decided not to oppose the projects 443 ) The Ruler stated that he stood by his agreement with the British Bank and undertook not to appoint a manager for the new Bank who was not approved by Her Majesty's Government^ 446 ) The Bank was opened towards the end of year with a British manager, a board of nine Kuwaiti merchants and a capital of Rs. 11 million.( 447 ) Up to the end of 1953 no report had been received to show that its operations were conflicting with the interests of sterling or that there was any friction between it and the local branch of the British Bank of the Middle East. (g) Post Office 197. Before the First World War the Government of India maintained a Post Office in Kuwait. During the war this was placed under the control of the Military Postal Service in Iraq, and was connected to Basra by land-line telegraph.( 41N ) On the formation after the war of a Civil Postal Service in Iraq it took over control of the Kuwait Post Office and of the land-line and continued to control them for many years. Indian postage stamps were used and from 1922 onwards, except for a brief period during the last war, bore the surcharge ' Kuwait.' When the British Mandate in Iraq came to an end the Ruler desired that the Iraqi Post Office and land-line should be removed from his territory but the Government of India were not anxious to assume responsibility for the postal administration of Kuwait and it was not considered practicable for the Ruler to administer his own postal services. Negotiations with Imperial and International Communications Limited for the establishment of a wireless station and the administration of the post office proved infructuous and at the end of 1932 the Iraqi Government suggested a general agreement whereby they would administer the Kuwait post office, telegraphs and telephones for twenty years. The Ruler was willing to enter into an agreement and suggested a number of conditions.( 449 ) Negotiations continued until 1934 when doubts began to arise in the minds of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India about the desirability of a long-term postal agreement between Kuwait and Iraq and it was decided to let matters rest for a year or two. In 1935 His Majesty's Government started negotiations with Cable and Wireless for establishing a wireless station at Kuwait and taking over the Post Office. These negotiations continued for several years, there being much correspondence about the rates to be charged, guarantees'against loss and so on. In 1936 the Ruler offered a free site to Cable and Wireless^ but refused to make good any loss incurred in the running of the Post Office. Final agreement was reached with Cable and Wireless in 1939 after the Ruler had made a number of concessions to them (paragraph 204 below). The Iraqis were asked to hand over the Post Office to them but demurred. When the coup d'etat occurred in Iraq in 1941 the Iraqi postal staff ceased to function and the Ruler at the Political Agent's request asked them to hand over the Post Office to Cable and Wireless. ^ The ( 442 ) I.O. to F.O.

As a result of the troubles in Iraq the carriage of mails by land between Kuwait and Basra ceased and the land -line broke down. The former service was restored in March 1942, the Indian postal authorities accepting responsibility for the carriage of mails as far as Zubair. The land-line was recognised as being the property of the Iraqi Government but the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department took over responsibility for its maintenance as far as the Kuwait-Iraq frontier and in May 1942 the Iraqi Government agreed to maintain the section of the line within their territory. They wished to conclude a formal agreement with the Government of India to cover this arrangement( 450 ) and some correspondence on this subject ensued but it appears that no agreement was ever executed. There was much correspondence with the Iraqi Government about their assets in the Kuwait Post Office.( 45i ) 198. In 1939 the Government of India and the Ruler agreed to the despatch of mails to and from Riyadh via Kuwait^ 52 ) but the arrangement broke down because the Iraqi postal authorities refused to co-operate. 199. On the transfer of power in India in August 1947 the Pakistan Government assumed responsibility for the administration of the Post Office until April 1, 1948, when it was taken over by the General Post Office and British stamps were introduced surcharged with Kuwait' and rupee values.

The General Post Office refused to take over the land-line to Basra and abandoned the carriage of mails by land between Kuwait and Basra. The latter step led to delays in the mails and many complaints, and in 1949 these, combined with the inadequacy of the premises which the General Post Office had inherited, formed the subject of a question in the House of Commons.(' ) Efforts made to obtain new premises proved unsuccessful and were eventually suspended owing to a proposal to make provision for a new building in the town-planning scheme. A site was selected and plans were made but construction was held up because the Kuwaitis wanted something more elaborate. Early in 1953 temporary accommodation was arranged for the Post Office in a Nissen hut and later m the year a British Postmaster was appointed. 201. When the Ruler visited Iraq in the spring of 1952 his staff reached an informal agreement with the Iraqi authorities that postal charges between the two countries would be at inland rates and that the carriage o^ mails by land between them would be restored, and the Ruler asked Her Majesty s Government to enter into a formal agreement with the Iraqi Government on his behalf accordingiy( 454 ) (paragraph 123 above). It was subsequently decided that no formal agreement'was necessary and that the arrangements proposed should be based on informal correspondence between the General lost Office and the raqi os Office A minute was initialled accordingly by representatives of the two Post Offices on March 5, 19 5 3( 455 ) (Appendix P). A contract for the daily ^rnage of mails by land between Kuwait and Basra was arranged by the Iraqi authorities with effect from July 1, 1953. 709 The Ruler has not vet asked for stamps to be used at Kuwait bearing his head, and it is reported to be unlikely that he will do so,( 4o,&gt; ) nor have there been anv signs of the Kuwaitis wishing to take over their own postal administration. In March 1953 the Director of Public Security at Kuwait wrote to the Postmaster askino him to suhmitaU mail to and from Israel for censorship.C') The Postmaster ■ comnlied for a few days and the Political Agent then told the Director of Public en*' 1 * Securitv that if it was desired to exercise such censorship an official request should ^ be macte to Her Majesty s Government accordingly through him. The D.rector of Public Security approached the Political Agent on the subject two months later but was told that his request could not be complied with. S ?

During the First World War telegraphic communication by land-line was established between Kuwait and Basra. 1 he history of this l an ' me 18 inked with that of the Post Office (sub-section (g) above) untn 1V46. 204. Discussions with Imperial and International Communications Limited for the establishment of a wireless station in Kuwait were initiated by His Majesty's Government in 1932 but proved infructuous. Cable and Wireless in 1935 but no agreement was reached until yiy. Ine Kuler then confirmed a previous promise to grant the company a tree site, undertook to exempt material imported for its services from customs duty and not to subject it to special taxation, and agreed that subject only to the rights held by the Kuwait Oil Company under their agreements it should have exclusive rights over wireless working with all external points and with aircraft.C 5 ) In June 1941, when the Company took over the Post Office (paragraph 197 above), they were only working a restricted service with a small borrowed wireless set. Soon after this they established their own wireless station, and in 1942 they installed an automatic telephone system in Kuwait town. 205. Although the Kuwait Oil Company under their agreements were only entitled to use wireless communication within Kuwait territory for the purpose of their operations, it was agreed in 1936 that no objection need be raised to their communicating with their tankers by means of their own wireless.( lj9 ) 206. Cable and Wireless had desired a formal agreement with the Ruler in 1940 but consideration of the matter was postponed until after the war. In 1947 after some haggling they obtained a concession for 20 years to operate telecom munication services between Kuwait and points outside Kuwait and services with aircraft and ships at sea, to provide a telephone service in Kuwait town and to receive and deliver public telegrams( 1(i0 ) (Appendix Q). This concession was exclusive except for rights already enjoyed by the Kuwait Oil Company, the Eastern Gulf Oil Company and the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department. Exemption was granted from customs duties on material required for the company's services and from special taxation, and the Ruler undertook to take all possible steps to prevent damage to or theft of the company's property. The company agreed to transmit private messages on behalf of the Ruler free of charge up to a stated limit and to train Kuwaitis for operating telegraph and telephone installations. The Ruler at first stipulated for an annual payment of £500, and was only with difficulty persuaded to abandon this demand. In return His Majesty's Government gave him a substantial present of arms and ammunition. In 1948 the Ruler agreed to lease two additional plots of land to the Company for 15 years for a total annual rent of Rs. 9,500.( 1&lt; ' 1 ) 207. When His Majesty's Government took over the Kuwait Post Office in 1948 neither the General Post Office nor Cable and Wireless wished to assume responsibility for the land-line to Basra, and'the latter proposed to establish direct wireless communication with Iraq. Negotiations ensued with the Iraqi authorities who wished to maintain the land-line and proposed to sell the Kuwait portion of it to His Majesty's Government. Eventually in 1951 they agreed to the abandonment of the land-line and made proposals for the introduction of a wireless link.( 462 ) 208. When the Ruler visited Iraq in the spring of 1952 his staff reached an informal agreement with the Iraqi authorities that charges for telegrams between the two countries should be at inland rates and that no attempt should be made re i j 0 u e ? uv C Tc wire ! ess telegraphic and telephonic communication should be established between Kuwait and Fao, and the Ruler asked Her Majesty's Government to en er into a formal agreement with the Iraqi Government on his behalf accordmgly( ) (paragraph 123 above). As in the case of Postal matters (paragraph 201 above) it was decided to leave it to Cable and Wireless to negotiate direct with the appropriate Iraq, authorities.

They were of opinion that it would be quite uneconomic for them to carry traffic between Kuwait and Iraq at the Iraqi inland rates and that it would be necessary to fix the rates in agreement with the Iraqis.( 165 ) 209. In October 1952 Cable and Wireless reached an agreement with the Kuwait Municipality whereby the Kuwait Government would purchase the telephone system but the company would continue to operate and maintain it on a contract basis.(' ') The system had for long proved inadequate and the company was only willing to extend it provided it could increase its charges to the public. To this the Ruler would not agree, and this led to the proposal that the Kuwait Government should take over the system and subsidise it. Fahad refused to approve the agreement, and expressed an opinion that the Kuwait telegraph services should also be nationalised. In December the Political Agent received a written request that both the wireless and the telephone services should be taken over by the Kuwait Government.( 467 ) The Ruler, who had been away when these events were taking place, supported the proposal on his return to Kuwait in January 1953 and refused to ratify the telephone agreement. Under instructions from His Majesty's Government the Political Agent called the Ruler's attention to the fact that he had a firm obligation to uphold his agreement with Cable and Wireless until it expired or was modified by agreement between the parties.( 46S ) The Ruler admitted that the agreement was still in force and said that he only desired a modification of it and that even when the Kuwait Government took over the services Cable and Wireless would continue to administer them.( 469 ) The company were strongly opposed to any nationalisation of the telegraph services, and eventually agreed to proceed with the extension of the telephone system without waiting for the ratification of the new agreement. The Ruler was informed accordingly and said that the rates for the extended system must be regulated under the existing agreement, which he promised to honour.( 170 ) The company were not satisfied with the situation and, at the end of the year, held up the despatch of the equipment for the extended service because of the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the negotiations for a telephone agreement. They were urged to continue at least the preliminary operations for the extension of the serviced 471 ) 210. In 1953 communication by radio telephone was established between Kuwait and Bahrain. 211. In or about 1952 Abdullah al Mubarak established a small broadcasting station in Kuwait. It was visited at the end of 1952 by the Head of the Near East Broadcasting Station who reported that it was most amateur and inefficient and that Abdullah al Mubarak wanted a much bigger station ' which would make the voice of Kuwait heard in the Arab world.'T 2 ) Though there were objections to such a station it was agreed that it was desirable to help in its development, rather than that Abdullah al Mubarak should turn for assistance elsewhere, and in February 1953 a team from the Near East Broadcasting Station visited Kuwait to advise him on the subject, but fortunately the Ruler disapproved of the scheme, no doubt on account of the expenditure involved, and nothing further had been heard of it by the end of 1953.

In 1933 the Iraqi Government asked t9 be informed of the date on which the Kuwaiti and Bahraini nationalities were constituted.( 1 ') A reply was eventually given to them, so far as Kuwait was concerned, in 1938, when the Iraqi Foreign Minister had argued that Kuwait stood in relation to Iraq in the same position as it had previously stood in relation to the Ottoman Empire, as follows : — ' The Shaikhdom of Kuwait was for a considerable period in an anomalous state of semi-dependence on the Ottoman Empire; His Majesty's Government have nevertheless been in treaty relations with the Shaikhs since 1841( 4 ') and Kuwait finally became completely independent of Turkey and Kuwaiti nationality finally came into existence on the same date as Iraq and Iraqi nationality.'( 47s ) This date appears to have been purposely left vague but cannot have been later than that of the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne, viz., August 6, 1924. Legal opinion was that the moment when Iraq began to have an independent existence could not be placed earlier than 1922.( 479 ) 215. In 1948 the Ruler issued a Nationality Law. His Majesty's Government suggested one amendment^ ls0 ) which was accepted and incorporated in the law in 1952 (Appendix R). 216. The Ruler has issued his own passports since 1936.C 81 ) A request from the Kuwait Government for the printing of passports in London in 1951 led to the preparation by the Richmond Herald of a design for a Coat of Arms for the Ruleif 82 ) which involved the standardisation of the Kuwait flag. The design was approved by the Ruler but work on the Coat of Arms had not been completed by the end of 1953 nor had the flag been finally standardised. There is no Kuwait passport law but all passport and immigration matters are dealt with by the Public Security Department. In 1949 the Head of the Department issued a notification obliging foreigners visiting or residing in Kuwait to register (Appendix S).

This arrangement is reciprocal so far as the other Gulf Shaikhdoms are concerned, negotiations for making it reciprocal with Iraq, the Lebanon and Syria were in progress at the end of 1953 (paragraphs 123 and 161 above), and the Ruler had asked for similar negotiations to be undertaken by His Majesty's Government with Egypt.( lst ) In Saudi Arabia Kuwaitis are to be granted visas free of charge on arrival at Dhahran (paragraph 146 above). 217.

It w ® s U p o fficer ^ the three Articles were brought into force and a Br Political Aeent appointed with his headquarters at Dohah. In ''eMwhile the Pol^ca Agent in Bahrain had been responsible for dealings with Std .^ still works nominally under his supervision, though dun g L c ^ , J . f Bahrain Political Agency has often been little more than a channel of correspondence between the Political Resident and the Political Ofhcer so far as political matters are concerned. Sir Roger Makins when he visited tne eTsian u in 1952 recommended that the Political Officer should report dnect to the Political Resident^ 1 ) and the raising of the status of the post to that ot Political Agent in direct subordination to the Political Resident was approved in principle in 1953. 2. Qatar has a population which probably does not exceed 25,000 and until 1949 was of little importance. Since that year with the rapidly increasing production of oil it has attracted more attention and efforts have been directed to ensuring a reasonable standard of administration and the proper disposal of the large revenue accruing, 3. In the instructions issued in 1953 to the new incumbent of the post of Political Resident the objectives of Her Majesty's Government in Qatar are defined as follows: — (i) to maintain the existing relationship between Her Majesty's Government and the Ruler of Qatar based on treaty and usage; (ii) to ensure stable conditions for the production of oil; (hi) to ensure that the revenues accruing to the State are disbursed, or invested, in a manner consonant with the interests of the United Kingdom; (iv) to build up the authority and influence of the British advisers and to create a sound administration in the State; (v) to determine finally the Qatar-Saudi-Abu Dhabi frontier; (vi) to create friendly relations between Qatar, the neighbouring British- Protected States and Saudi Arabia/ 2 ) II.—Internal Affairs 4, Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim (Jasim) al Thani became Shaikh of Dohah and the Turkish Qaim-Maqam there about 1906 long before his father's death. To what extent he was able to exercise his authority over his relations and especially over his elder brother Abdur Rahman at Wakrah is doubtful but on the departure of the Turks from Dohah early in the First World War he was recognised by His Majesty's Government as Ruler and in 1916 a TreatyO was concluded with him. The Al Thani were originally a family of pearl merchants and their wealth before the grant of an oil concession in 1935 was derived almost entirely from the pearl trade, the State revenues being very meagre. After the First World War Abdullah was granted the C.I.E. and a salute of seven guns together with the title of His Excellency. He was an astute Ruler and obstinate and difficult to deal with. 5. In the Historical Summary of Events for 1907 to 1928 practically the only references to Qatar subsequent to 1916 concern the State's relations with Ibn Saud.O Between 1928 and 1949 there is little on record in the reports about the State that is not concerned either with these relations or with the oil concession There is mention of a few slave cases and of quarrels between members of the ruling family (*) Para. 13 {d) at p. 6, Sir R. iMakins' Report.

No problems arose during the last war, beyond that of keeping the small population supplied with the necessities of life. 6. The negotiations for the oil concession which took place between 1933 and 1935 (paragraph 26 below) did however raise a number of important questions.(') Abdullah refused to grant a concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company unless he was given a promise of protection against aggression by land. This was accorded in writing, subject by implication to the grant of certain facilities to the Royal Air Force (Appendix A). In return for a cession of jurisdiction His Majesty's Government agreed to recognise his second son Hamad as his heir apparent, provided he granted an oil concession to the company. They also agreed to grant him and his successors support in any internal difficulties arising from the presence of the oil company (Appendix B). Abdullah in his turn agreedO that the Treaty of 1916 would be binding on his heirs and successors. 7. In 1948 Hamad who had for some years been performing the functions of Ruler died and Abdullah with the agreement of the other members of the ruling family and of the notables appointed his eldest son Ali as his successor. In April 1949 His Majesty's Government at Abdullah's request agreed to recognise Ali as his heir apparent. The Political Resident proposed to attach certain conditions to this recognition but before negotiations for this purpose could be initiated Abdullah found himself unable to deal with the demands of his relations for an increased share of the payments under the oil concession and with an outbreak of lawlessness, and asked that a British Political Officer should be appointed to Qatar and that he should be allowed to abdicate in favour of Ali. On August 19 he signed a letter( ) accepting the entry into force ol all the articles of the Treaty of 19 6 and on the following day in a letter to the Political Agent Bahrain he announced his abdication in favour of Ali.D Ali then signed letters( ) accepting the Treaty oi 1916 and all other treaties and obligations and asking for the appointment ot an Adviser and the acting Political Resident formally conveyed His Majesty s Government's recognition to him. A landing party from one of His Majesty s ships was present on the occasion and remained in Dohah for a few days to stabilise the situation. Demonstrations by other members of the ruling family were feared but none in fact occurred. On August 23 a British Political Officer arrived and established his headquarters at Dohah. 8 Ali was about 56 years old when he succeeded. He had been kept m the background while his younger brother Hamad was alive and was considered to have a iSfdous and imwordly disposition.

Before the abdication of Abdullah the ^ding figure m s^de the ruling family was Salih al Mani through whom much business with the Ruler was conducted and who was e u; n Darwish the oil companies. Since the abdication another merchant, Abdullah bin Darwish has acquired a predominating position. He has amassed gre , . &gt; able and exercises great influence over Ah, so much so that he ^ J, of the peninsula. He has completely eclipsed Sahh and in 1953 took oyer Im position as the Ruler's representative with the oil companies. He is an unpleasant and dangerous personality but up to date has taken care to keep on the good side of the British political authorities. 11. So far as internal affairs are concerned Ali since his accession has been chiefly troubled with the misbehaviour of some of his relatives and the constant demand of members of the ruling family tor increased allowances. e misbehaviour has not been of a very serious nature, though on once occasioji in 1952 a frigate had to be sent to Dohah to support Ali should need arise, and lately with his strong and well-armed police he has been able to take a firmer line with offending Shaikhs. The question of allowances both for Ali himseli and tor his relatives has caused much concern to the political authorities, in 1950 when the revenue from oil did not amount to more than about £500,000 it was arranged that one-fourth of it should be retained by Ali.( 11 ) At the same time about one-twelfth of the revenue was devoted to allowances for other members of the ruling family( 1 on the basis of the practice at Bahrain where one-third of the oil revenue is set aside for the Ruler and his family. As the oil revenue increased (it amounted to about £41 millions in 1953) the Ruler's privy purse increased automatically, but the allowances of the members of his family did not, as they had been fixed at so much per head. This led to constant demands for more to which the Ruler acceded. Attempts were made to persuade him to agree to a limitation both of his own privy purse and of his family's allowances and finally in August 1952 the Political Resident wrote to him asking him not to make any increase in the total allowances of himself and his family except after prior consultation with the Political Resident^ 13 ) He replied undertaking to send a modified list of allowances for his family for the Political Resident's views and comments, which he said he would hold himself unable to dispense with, but expressing his inability to make do with less than a quarter share of the oil revenues for himself,( 14 ) and shortly afterwards forwarded the modified list of family allowances for the Political Resident's comments. The latter approved the list on the understanding that the amount involved, viz., Rs. 387,000 per month, would not be increased in future even though there might be an increase in the revenue from oil. He also indicated that he might again be addressing him on the subject of his privy purse. Ali replied that the question of increases in his family's allowances must depend upon circumstances and that he had already said all there was to be said on the subject of his privy purse.( 15 ) No further approach was made to him on the latter subject partly from fear of driving him into the arms of the Saudis, and early in 1953 the Political Resident agreed to an increase of Rs. 6,000 a month in the family's allowances to meet the needs of a few persons who had been left out of the original list.( 16 ) It may be noted that the family have been claiming throughout that one-fourth of the 'whole oil revenue should be distributed amongst them. 12. Great difficulty was experienced in finding a suitable candidate for the post of Adviser in Qatar but eventually Group Captain P. L. Plant was selected. He took over his duties in February 1950 and the Ruler in due course signed an agreement with him undertaking to employ him as Adviser for five years.( 17 ) By the ( 11 ) P.R. toF.O. 88/22/50of April 10, 1950 (EA 1533/10 of 1950).

He at first agreed to do so but subsequently changed his mind. In June the Political Resident suggested orally to the Ruler that he should dispense with Plant's services, but the Ruler asked for an order to this effect in writing. Plant thereupon brought a suit against Her Majesty's Attorney-General and the Political Resident for an injunction to restrain the taking of any steps to induce the Ruler of Qatar to terminate his contract. In July the Political Resident wrote to the Ruler asking but not ordering him to dismiss Plant. The Ruler acted accordingly and in his letter to Plant expressed himself extremely perturbed at his institution of legal proceedings. Plant replied accepting his dismissal and subsequently discontinued his action. 13. After Plant's departure from Qatar Mr. Hale the State Engineer acted as Adviser so far as general administration was concerned while Mr. Cochrane who was commanding the State Police held independent charge of law and order. Meanwhile numerous candidates were considered for the post and eventually Mr. G. M. Hancock, O.B.E., was selected and accepted by the Ruler. He arrived in Qatar in November 1952 and signed a contract for five years. 14. Since the appointment of an Adviser some progress has been made in improving the general administration of the State, and in particular Hancock since his arrival has directed his efforts towards creating the nucleus of an administrative machine, instituting proper financial control within the Government and implementing a development programme planned on orderly lines. Previously there was no organised administration and practically the only State official was the Director of Customs. Plant established a law court in which he and the Ruler's son Ahmad administered justice and brought into being a Municipal Committee for Dohah. A British Commandant of Police was appointed very soon after Ali's accession. Early in 1952 a British State Doctor and a British State Engineer arrived and since then there have been a number of other increases in the administrative staff. A primary school was built and opened in 1952. 15 Plant produced a very rough budget in 1950 when the revenue was estimated at Rs. 65,00,000 and the expenditure Rs. 44,49,000. A more reliable budget was produced for the Muhammadan year 1370 ending October 1, 1951, when the revenue was estimated at Rs. 70,00,000 and the expenditure at Rs. 51,68,428. In the Muhammadan year 1371 ending September 19, 1952, the revenue was estimated at Rs. 321,75,000 and the expenditure at Rs. 208,65,z95. No budget was produced for the Muhammadan year 1372 ending September 10, 1953, but it was reported that the revenue was Rs. 359,00,000 and the expenditure, including an investment of Rs. 75,00,000 in United Kingdom securities, Rs. 259,00,000. In the budget for the Muhammadan year 1373 ending August 31, 1954, the reveniiw is estimated at Rs. 740,77,292 and the expenditure at Rs. 668,16,489. The investment of the State's surplus revenue has been a matter ot concern to H^r Majesty's Government. It has been decided that for the present there is no necessitv to set up an Investment Board on the Kuwait model (Chapter 3, paragraph 20), and that the Adviser may be left to arrange for investment through the Eastern Bank or other suitable agency.( ) 16. In 1952 all the customs duties were reduced to 2} per cent, ad valorem except those on tobacco and alcohol which remained at 10 per cent, and ^5per cent, respectively The Ruler has strong feelings on the subject of alcohol and early m 1953 it was reported that he was intending to following the example of the Saudis and impose a complete prohibition on its import This would probably have led to a conflict with Her Majesty's Government who could hardly have agreed to enforce the prohibition as against persons subject to their jurisdiction. As it i^ persons subject to the Ruler's jurisdiction are prohibited from importing or consuming alcohol while others can obtain it on permits issued by the Political Agent under the provisions of a Queen s Regulation.* 17 Mr Cochrane who had previously been employed with the Bahrain Police arrived in Qatar in September 1949 to form a local police force. ^Progress was gradual but by 1953 the force was 300 strong with seven British officers.

Development in Dohah started slowly but by L^e end ot 1953 it was gathering momentum. A British State Engineer, Mr. H. . a ?• early in 1952, and a number of other British engineers joined his staff. In 1953 plans had been made for a piped water supply involving the installation of a distillation plant, the water produced from which was to be mixed with local water for drinking purposes, an electricity undertaking was under cons ™ C *; 10I J' work had started on new police lines, and a design for a new hospital by a ritisn architect had been approved.( J ') The contracts for the water supply and electricity undertakings were given to a British firm but apart from this the practice was growing up of giving construction work to a partnership formed for the purpose by Abdullah bin Darwish (paragraph 10 above), and the Lebanese Contracting and Trading Company.( 21 ) The Political Resident was instructed that British firms should in principle be assisted to share Qatar Government work with this organisation^ 22 ) The Qatar Government have appointed Abdullah bin Darwish as their purchasing agent and he in turn has contracted with C. Tennant Sons and Company Limited to make all Qatar Government purchases in Europe through them. 19. Hitherto Qatar's requirements have been imported via Bahrain where they pay 2 per cent, transit duty (or more when the Ruler of Bahrain is on bad terms with Qatar) or Dubai where they pay 4^ per cent, customs duty. The Qatar Government are therefore most anxious to develop a port of their own but this question has given rise to much controversy. The Qatar Petroleum Company have always been unwilling to allow the general public to use their facilities at Umm Sa'id. A scheme for the construction of a separate jetty for public use at this place was considered and rejected. The company are proposing to build a wharf for their own purposes and are reported to have stated that they would not proceed with the project if the Ruler insisted on his people being allowed to use it. Dohah is unsuitable for development as a port for direct call by ocean-going steamers as vessels of more than about 15 feet draught cannot get nearer than 7 or 8 miles and have to anchor in an exposed position.( 23 ) The Adviser therefore in 1953 proposed to bring goods from vessels calling at Umm Sa'id to Dohah by lighters.( 24 ) To facilitate this the customs jetty at Dohah is to be extended. 20. In 1952 Abdullah bin Darwish and a Kuwait merchant evolved a scheme for the erection of a cement factory in Qatar. They proposed to associate a British firm in the enterprise and to raise a loan from a British bank. Her Majesty's Government did not approve the proposal to raise a loan in the United KingdomO and they decided to carry on without it. They reported at the end of 1953 that they believed that ample materials existed in Qatar for the production of cement and that they proposed to erect a German plant working on natural gas from the oil-field and to site it near Dukhan using Zikrit as a port. III.—Southern Boundary of Qatar 21. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company's negotiations with the Ruler for an oil concession in the years 193^ to 1935 (paragraph 26 below) led to much discussion about the position of the southern boundary of Qatar. The whole question is examined in detail in an India Office memorandum prepared early m 1934.( 26 ) (-') P.R. to P.O. 14 (E) of February 6, 1953 (EA 1107/1 of IQ'm ( 21 ) Tel. from P.R. to P.O. 42, Saving, of September 23 1953 (EA 1107/4 of IQS^ («) Tel. from F.O. to P.R. 1165 of October t, 1953 (EA 1107/1 of ig(t^ (-) P.R. to F.O.

P.Z. 614/34 of February 20, 1934 (E 1156/279/91 of 1934).M 125 Three lines emerged, viz.: (1) the oil concession boundary; (2) a rough line laid down by His Majesty's Government as the line beyond which they would not be prepared to protect or recognise the authority of the Ruler; and (3) the boundary of Saudi Arabia, which was described as the Blue Line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913( 2 ') or an agreed modification of it. (1) is shown on the map attached to the oil concession of 1935 and, according to the oil company, was shown to the geologist by the Ruler himself on the ground as his boundary.( 2S ) The Ruler confirmed to the Political Resident that this was his southern boundary and stated that beyond it a neutral zone between Qatar and Abu Dhabi extended along the coast and some miles inland from Khor al Odaid to Sabkhat Matti, but that this zone was not recognised by Ibn Saud, who took revenue from it.( 2 ) (2) is ' a line drawn from a point at the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay passing South of Salwa and of Sakak to the coast immediately north of the Khor-al-Odaid inlet.'( ■') This line has not been communicated to the Ruler. The area between (2) and (3) was then regarded as a no-man's land subject to British influence. 22. In the negotiations with the Saudi Arabian Government about their south-eastern boundary before the last war (Chapter 5, paragraph 95) they claimed the Jabal Nakhsh as being included in Saudi Arabia. They at first based their claim on on alleged agreement with Abdullah before the 1916 Treaty but subsequently admitted that no such agreement existed. It is, however, believed that in 1934 Abdullah came to some secret agreement with Ibn Saud about his boundary through an emissary called Muhammad bin Nasir. Abdullah himself stated that he had replied through the emissary that his boundary extended to and included Al Mashabiyah.C 1 ) 23 In 1949 the Saudis claimed a boundary bearing due east from a point on the coast of the Gulf of Salwa at latitude 24° 56' N. as far as longitude 51° E. and thence in a straight line to the coast at latitude 24 48 N., leaving Amirah to Saudi Arabia (Chapter 5, Appendix H). At the Damman Conference in 19^2 the Ruler of Qatar claimed that his boundary ran through the following places : Ghar al Buraid Al Mashabiyah, Al Khuwaimat, Qarn abu Wall, Jau al Salamah, Sauda Nathila, Iqlat Manasir, Khufus, Maharaf. The first-named place is on the western coast of the peninsula four miles north of Salwah and the last named at the head of the Khor al Odaid. This boundary is described m detail and discussed in a note prepared about the same time by the Political Officer, Qatar.( ) 24. No authoritative pronouncement has ever been made about the exact oosition of the boundary between Qatar and Abu Dhabi and it would clearly be otiose to make one™ the boundary dispute with the Saudis has been settled. In 1951 the Political Resident suggested that, if it was found necessary to give an oninion on the subiect during the course of the negotiation with the Saudis, should be claimed that the Khor al Odaid belongs to Abu Dhabi and the country t „ omar ( 3 ') It may be noted Abu Dhabi claims Ummat Hul near tontoy O ™. data rSiSTS — r ' India in 1895 but the correspondence on the subject is not traceable. IV.—Oil 25. In 1923 the Eastern and General Syndicate (Major Holmes) sought the permission of the asH^Majesty's' Government considered ZtTfLgloTeSM Company had a prior claim.O In 1926 the latter that the Anglo rers , Government's permission, sent a reconnaissance company with H s Majesty s o Ruler F an undertaking that he would not party to Qatar which gained trom m ^ ^ tr ired grant a concession to any ouici yany ( 27 ) No. 5 VI, T.C. innuarv 14 1935 (E 324/269/91 of 1935). n I.O. to P.O.

There was evidence that during that time communications passed between the Ruler and the Standard Oil Company of California and that Ibn Saud was bringing pressure to bear upon the Rujer to grant a concession to that company, and the Ruler had to be reminded ot his obligation under Article 5 of his Treaty and told that His Majesty's Government would not agree to the grant of a concession to a company that was not at least partly British. rogress in the negotiations was held up for many months by the Ruler s insistence on a guarantee from His Majesty's Government ol protection from landward aggression. In April 1934 the Political Resident informed him in writing that His Majesty s Government were prepared to give him protection on land in addition to the protection on sea which was already given to him.( 38 ) In spite of this negotiations were not resumed until the following year but meanwhile the Anglo-Persian Oil Company obtained an extension of their option up to April 13, 1935. This period was subsequently extended to May 4, 1935. Agreement was reached between the company and the Ruler regarding the terms of the concession at the end of April but the latter would not sign an agreement until he had received written assurances from the Political Resident on the subject of protection and the recognition of his son Hamad as heir-apparent. These assurances were given on May 11 and the concession^ 9 ) was signed on May 17. The question of protection and the recognition of Hamad, and also those of jurisdiction, facilities for the Royal Air Force and the position of the southern boundary of Qatar, all of which arose in the course of the negotiations, are dealt with in detail elsewhere. A Political Agreement^ 0 ) between His Majesty's Government and the company was signed on June 5. A copy of it was communicated to the Ruler who agreed in an exchange of letters( 41 ) to take cognisance of it. 27. The concession is for 75 years and covers the whole area over which the Shaikh rules and which is marked on the north of the line drawn on the map attached to it. This line which is known as the ' concession line ' is discussed separately (paragraph 21 above). Rs. 4,00,000 was paid on signature and Rs. 1,50,000 was payable annually for the first five years and after that Rs. 3,00,000 annually until the end of the concession. The royalty fixed was Rs. 3/- per ton. The concession is accompanied by two letters from the oil company's representative. The first( 12 ) of these contains four miscellaneous undertakings, of which one is for the free supply of certain quantities of petrol and kerosine to the Ruler, and the second( 43 ) promises that the company will not operate on the land which surrounds the Ruler's castle at Dohah. 28. Throughout the negotiations it had been understood that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would in due course transfer the concession to the Iraq Petroleum Company. A company called Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. was formed to operate the concession as an associate of the Iraq Petroleum Company and in October 1936 the Ruler agreed to its taking over the concession. It worked in co-operation with the Iraq Petroleum Company's organisation in Bahrain, which is known as Petroleum Concessions Ltd., and the head of this organisation's office in Bahrain was until recently its Chief Local Representative under the Political Agreement. Early in 1937 an agreement^ 4 ) was signed between His Majesty s Government and the new company whereby the latter agreed to ( 36 ) C.O. to P.O. 98116/32 of October 18, 1932 (EA 5442/3372/91 of 1932 1 ) n C.O. to P.O. 18216/33 of May 29, 1933 (E 2803/156/91 of 1933) ( 38 ) I.O. to P.O.

In 1953 Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited changed its name to ' The Qatar Petroleum Company Limited.' 29. In 1937 Petroleum Concessions Ltd. entered into an agreement 1 ') with His Majesty's Government that whenever they or their associates produced crude oil in the Persian Gulf area up to a total of 500,000 tons a year they would erect a refinery on the Arab side of the Gulf unless they could show to the satisfaction of His Majesty's Government that this would be precluded by commercial considerations. When production had reached the stipulated figure in Qatar in 1951 His Majesty's Government decided that it was not necessary to enforce this agreement while reserving their right to do so( 4(1 ) but in 1953 the company under some pressure from the Ruler decided to build a small topping plant in Qatari 1 ') 30. In 1938 the company established their camp at Dukhan on the western side of the Qatar peninsula, and built a jetty at Zikrit. They started drilling and struck oil in the following year. In 1942 when they were preparing to drill their fourth well they were asked to close down their operations for the duration of the war and to plug the wells they had already drilled. Great difficulty was experienced in obtaining the Ruler's concurrence in the suspension of operations. 31. The company resumed operations in 1946. In 1939 His Majesty s Government had agreed to their constructing a landing-ground for aircraft at Dukhan but difficulty had been experienced with the Ruler who demanded that his authorisation should be obtained for any aircraft landing on his territory under the terms of their concession agreement. In 1946 he was persuaded to grant a blanket permission for aircraft on the Company's business to land in his territory and also to agree to the use by the company of ports other than Dohah, to which they naa previously been restricted by their concession.! 48 ) The company soon after this began work on the development of a port at Umm Sa'id on the east coast oi the peninsula and constructed a jetty, oil terminals, and a e 1 r&lt; r Ar formal opening ceremony was held there in February 1950 at which Shaikh All pontificated but the first shipment of oil had actually taken place in the previous December. Detailed Regulations have been drafted for this port and forwarded to the Political Residency with instructions to present them to the Ruler and to ask him to issue them.D They had not been presented to him by the end of 1953. 32. In 1951 a General Manager was appointed to Dukhan and placed in charge not only of Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., but also of the other Iraq Petroleum Company associates in the Persian Gulf. The Chie Local Representative for all the associates continued to reside in Bahrain for the time being but was transferred to Dukhan in 1952. A Local Representative for Qatar has resided at Dohah since 1950. A Local Representative is alsomaintamedat Bahrain in the office of Petroleum Concessions Ltd, which is now httie more than an administrative unit, for dealing with transients and visitors. e ea quar ers of the Qatar Petroleum Company Ltd, as Petroleum Development (Q^) Ltd, is now called, are still at Dukhan but it is intended to transfer them to Umm Sa id, which is being developed accordingly. 33 In Mav 1951 the Ruler asked for an increase in the royalty rate. The company offered him Rs. 10/- per ton but at the same time made a number of requests, one of them for an undertaking that if as a result of a settlement of the boundary dispute with the Saudis Qatar obtained any territory south of the ' concession line ' (paragraph 27 above) it would be added to their concession area. This greatly annoyed the Ruler. In October the Company wrote to him agreeing to rnakp the increased payment unconditionally with effect irom the previous May ( 50 ) They also discussed their various requests, one of which relating to t e takins over bv the Oatar Police of responsibility for guarding the company s camps and^nsulnations the Ruler had already conceded (paragraph 17 above). The Ruler accented the navment offered and wrote a letter to the company agreeing that it would be undesirable that any other company should be granted a concession in any wea of Qatar SOTth of the concession line and promising to open negotiations with R F,0. 4 to PeSdeum Concessions Ltd f A &gt;536/6 ot Febrnary 5 1951. {') P.D.Q. to F.O. 7030 of February 4, 1953 (EA 15314/1 ot 1953).

All payments are to be made in sterling but the company subsequently agreed to pay in Indian rupees instead of sterling such proportion of them as the Ruler might require for so ong s the present freedom of exchange between the Indian rupee and sterling pre V ) The agreement was accompanied by a number of letters. In the first! ) of the Company (a) mentions its understanding that the Ruler will issue an Income Tax Decree and (b) agrees to pay a sum of Rs. 5,000,000 in satisfaction of any claims to additional payments in respect of the period prior to the agreement (which the Ruler had sought to make retrospective). The Ruler replied(' ) confirming that it was his intention to issue the Income Tax Decree and accepting the payment offered. The Income Tax Decree, the object of which is to enable the company to apply for income-tax relief in the United Kingdom, had not been issued by the end of 1953 as the Ruler had not agreed to the terms of the draft presented to him.( JJ ) In a second letter( 5ti ) the company asked for an option for any territory eventually found to belong to the Ruler outside the limits of the existing concession. The Ruler replied( 57 ) refusing a formal option but gave the company an assurance that he would not enter into negotiations with any other company without first giving Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. the opportunity of concluding an agreement with him. The other letters( 58 ) covered the free supply of petrol and kerosene to the Ruler, a payment to be made until the end of 1953 as an interim measure pending the calculation of profits, and payments by the company for the use of ports. The Political Resident was asked to make it clear to both parties that the Political Agreement of 1935 and the letters then exchanged between him and the Ruler (paragraph 26 above) applied to the new agjeement and to obtain their acknowledgments.( 59 ) When this had been done( fi0 ) the agreement was approved by Her Majesty's Government. 35. The company have drilled some 35 wells in Qatar and their production at the end of 1953 was at the rate of 4^ million tons a year. Their relations with the political authorities, the Ruler and their Arab labour have not always been happy. Until 1949 there was no Political Officer in Qatar and they became used to conducting their relations direct with the Ruler. Subsequently they found it difficult to conform strictly with the terms of their Political Agreement and some friction resulted. The whole matter was discussed at the Foreign Office in 1950.( 61 ) The company have annoyed the Ruler by trying to be too clever in their dealings with him and by their selfish attitude for a time over the grant of facilities to others at their port at Umm Sa'id and their landing-ground at Dohah. Their machinery for dealing with their Arab labour appears to be unsatisfactory and there were serious strikes in 1950, 1951 and 1952. Under some pressure from the political authorities they have taken steps to improve the accommodation for their Arab employees( G2 ) but their arrangements for providing them with both academic and ( 51 ) No. 5 III.

He refused the offer at the time but reserved his right to accept it at a later date.('' ,a ) 36. In June 1949 Abdullah issued his declaration of rights over the sea-bed. He was at once approached for an off-shore oil concession by a combine of the Superior Oil Company, an American Company, and the Central Mining and Investment Corporation Ltd., a British company. The latter company held only a 12} per cent, interest. The concession agreement was signed on August 5,1949.C ) It applied to ' all of the sea-bed and sub-soil underlying the waters of the Persian Gulf which fall within the jurisdiction and control of the Ruler of Qatar and which lie beyond the territorial waters contiguous to the mainland and islands of Qatar.' Provision was made for the payment of Rs. 5,00,000 on signature and of Rs. 10,00,000 annually until the discovery of oil. The royalty was fixed at one-fourth of the ' proceeds of sale.'' A Political Agreement between His Majesty s Government and the company had been signed in July.C ') Besides the usual provisions it contained an undertaking that the company would comply with all reasonable requirements of His Majesty's Government affecting navigation, fishing, and pearling in the high seas of the Persian Gulf. This agreement was communicated to the Ruler who agreed to take cognisance of it in an exchange or letters. The company formed to work the concession was called the International Marine Oil Company Ltd. and was registered in Canada. 37. Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. held that their concession automatically covered the sea-bed and disputed the Ruler s right to a separa e concession for it. Under the terms of their agreement they demanded a reference to arbitration. The Ruler and the company each appointed an arbitrator, and tne two arbitrators appointed a third arbitrator. The arbitration proceedings took place at Dohah in March 1950.( 66 ) The decision reached was that Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd.'s concession covered islands over which Shaikh Abdullah ruled when the concession was granted, the bed and subsoil of all ml and or nationa waters and the sea-bed and subsoil beneath the territorial waters of the mainland and islands, but not the sea-bed or subsoil beneath the high seas contiguous to the territorial waters. 38 An area which it was considered would almost certainly fall to Qatar when sea-bed boundaries were delimited, was defined and the Oil Company were informed that they might operate within them.( ) This an.a included the sea-bed to the west of Qatar between its The sea-bed boundary between Qatar and Bahrain which was defined in 1947.

Immediately after the termination of the Inter natioiiaJ „ Manne Oil Company's concession, the Shell Overseas Exploiation Comp y pp e Ruler for an off-shore concession. A Memorandum of Agreement was signed in May 1952 but the execution of the main Agreement was deierred pending the conclusion of a fifty-fifty profit-sharing agreement between Petroleum Devdopment (Qatar), Ltd., and the Ruler (paragraph 34 above), fhe mam agreement! ) was eventually signed on November 29, 1952. It was tor 75 years and covered (i) all the sea-bed and subsoil underlying the spring vide of the vvaters of t e Persian Gulf which fall within the jurisdiction of the Shaikh and which he beyond territorial waters, and (ii) any and all islands, islets, shoais and bars which may after the 6th day of August, 1952, rise trom, accumulate, buna up or otherwise be created by nature or by the company above spring tide of the waters within the area as defined in (i) above.' 1 Provision was made for a signature payment of £231,976 and an annual payment of £75,415 until the commencement of regular exports of oil, and after that of £37,707. All payments other than the signature payment are be made in sterling. There is an obligation to drill within two years but the period may be extended by successive periods ol one year each on payment of £37,707 for each extension. The arrangements regarding the payment ol royalty and the sharing of profits are on the lines of those provided lor in Petroleum Development (Qatar), Limited's profit-sharing agreement of 1952 (paragraph 34 above). Three letters are attached to the agreement. The first( ! ) of these covers a number of miscellaneous matters, mostly of an administrative nature, and includes an undertaking by the company to discuss with the Ruler the measures to be taken if it is compelled to suspend its operations by means of force majeure, the second( 74 ) relates to payments to be made under the agreements and the third( 75 ) contains a promise by the company to bring its personnel and equipment from Bahrain to Dohah by specified dates. 40. A Political Agreement( 7G ) between Her Majesty's Government and the company was signed on December 15, 1952. Besides the usual provisions, including one about navigation, fishing and pearling as in the Superior Oil Company's Political Agreement (paragraph 36 above), it contained an undertaking by the Company not to dispute with the Ruler or Her Majesty's Government about the boundaries of the sea-bed area and until they were fixed to refrain from any operations permanently affecting the sea-bed in any area which the Ruler or Her Majesty's Government might define. The company had already agreed to refrain from such operations in the waters around the Dibal and Jaradah shoals,( 77 ) and before the signing of the agreement the Foreign Office issued detailed instructions to the company about the area in which they might operate and defined certain limits( 78 ) (Appendix C). The Political Agreement was communicated to the Ruler but the usual exchange of letters regarding it had not been effected by the end of 1953 owing to the Ruler's request for clarification of certain points in the Agreement. 41. The company is constructing residential quarters on the north side of Dohah and an industrial area on the south side of the town. In this it is pursuing a different policy from the other oil companies in the Gulf who have located their camps at a distance from the main centres of population. 42. At the end of 1953 a company called the Shell Company of Qatar, Limited, was incorporated in the United Kingdom to operate the concession, which it was proposed to assign to it. V.— Relations with Other States {a) The Gulf States . fAbdullah attacked some Na'im tribesmen from Bahrain in the vicinity of Zubarah and expelled them.

The dispute is dealt with in detail in the chapter on Bahrain (Chapter 2, Section III). 44. The ownership of the Hawar Islands was also in dispute between the two Shaikhdoms, and in 19J9 they were awarded to Bahrain (Chapter 2, paragraph 41). In 1947 when a sea-bed boundary was fixed between Qatar and Bahrain (Chapter 2, paragraph 43) it was decided that the island of Janan, which is not specifically mentioned in the decision about the Hawar Islands and is separated from the rest ol the group by a deep channel, belonged to Qatar. It may be noted here that the Ruler of Bahrain claims rights over the whole of the high seas and sea-bed between Bahrain and Qatar and that he has not accepted the 1947 boundary. 45. When Abdullah abdicated the Ruler of Bahrain hoped for better relations with his successor and sent him some rifles on loan which Ali was with difficulty persuaded to accept. In 1950 a temporary settlement of the Zubarah dispute was effected, and early in 1951 Ali paid a formal visit to Bahrain where he was well received by Shaikh Salman. The latter, however, never returned the visit and at the end of 1952 sent a party of schoolmasters and schoolboys to Zubarah without any prior intimation to Ali. A map was also published in a Bahrain Education Report which showed Zubarah as Bahrain territory. Ali thereupon stationed some police at Zubarah and at the end of 1953 relations between the two Shaikhdoms were again strained. 46. The relations between Qatar and Abu Dhabi are bad owing to the latter's claims in the southern part of the Qatar peninsula (paragraph 24 above) and the dispute over Halul Island (Chapter 5, paragraph 54). Though Ali has never specifically supported the Saudi claim to the Khor al Odaid and it has been stated by one of his entourage that Abu Dhabi would be a less dangerous neighbour in this area than the Saudis, he has made little secret of the fact that his sympathy lies with the Saudis in their dispute over the Abu Dhabi frontier generally. {b) Saudi Arabia 47. The relations of Qatar with Saudi Arabia before 1928 are summarised in the Historical Summary Events for 1907-4928,( 7!) ) in which it is mentioned amongst other things that in 1923 Sir Percy Cox, on finding that Ibn Saud was apparently including the Qatar peninsular within the tract of country for which he was ^ prepared to negotiate an oil concession, had taken him to task and reminded him that he had nothing to do with Qatar except to respect it under the terms of his treaty with us. He reported that Ibn Saud accepted this injunction without argument. 48. Nothing further of importance happened until 1932 when the Anglo- Persian Oil Company started negotiations with Abdullah for an oil concession. Ibn Saud then supported the claims of the Standard Oil Company of California to a concession (paragraph 26 above). In 1933 he summoned Abdullah to Riyadh and it is reported though not confirmed that there he warned Abdullah that he expected him to give any oil concession, that might be going, to his friends the Americans and not the British. He went on to tell him that only Dohah could be considered as belonging to the Al Thani family and that the rest of the peninsula belonged to himself.D In 1934 he sent an emissary to Qatar with whom Abdullah made certain ' arrangements,' which are believed to have included an agreement regarding the position of the southern boundary of Qatar (paragraph 22 above). Abdullah was taken to task by the Political Resident over these ' arrangements ' as bein* a breach of the Treaty of 1916,D but as he had expressed a fear that he would have serious trouble with the nomad tribes if he did not keep up his relations with Ibn Saud he was promised protection on land. About this time it was reported that Abdullah had been paying a sum estimated at £10,000 a year to Ibn Saud which was variously described as tribute or a loan.( ) In August 1935, after Abdullah had granted an oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ibn Saud wrote to him stating that no one other than himself had any right to claim anything132 in the desert or among the tnb ff a 'p concession before the boundaries hetween hi ^ an startec i before this was He threatened to stop any , 0 P e J aU , on ^.^'f rv ,F Forewn Affairs protested to His done.C 3 ) Soon after this the M'mst y o i orejn^A &gt; the Majesty's Legation at Jedda and stated that Qat r^oiifnrnia A r-^nlv was granted by iLSand to the Standard Oil Company o CaWorniai ^ Aj^y was wkh AbduUa^ancHMomi^ 0 ^!^!!^; His Majesty's Government had formally ^sur^ fhe Shaikh of Qatar of their protection Vbdullah territorial rights. The question of the boundary w r vprTirnen f renlied denvins was informed of the action taken. The Saudi Arabian Rulers and that they were under any obligation not to correspon otherwise reserving their rights.C') 49. The Saudis did not implement their threat to interfere with oil operations in Qatar and there is no record of any other such interference until early in 949 when parties from the Arabian American Oil Company visited the southern part of thepeninsula .r) It is possible that in the meanwhile S audit ax-coectorsmay have visited Qatar as they did Abu Dhabi (Chapter 5, paragraph 94), but m 1949 it was reported that they had not done so for five years.( s ) The subsequent incursion of parties from the Arabian American Oil Company into Abu Dhabi led to the reopening of the dispute over the south -eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. 50 The history of this dispute has been traced in the chapter on the Trucial States (Chapter 5, paragraphs 95-103). Ali was unwilling to send any representative to Jedda to assist the British representatives m the negotiations which took place there in October 1949 and stated that he left the conduct of his case entirely in the hands of His Majesty's Government. He did after some show of reluctance attend the conference at Dammam in January and February 1952 and stated his claim (paragraph 23 above). The Saudis neither accepted nor rejected it, and generally speaking the attitude both of Ali and the Saudis was then and has been since that their mutual relations are so good that no dispute can possibly exist. At the end ot 1952 when Ali was asked to agree to the reference of the dispute to arbitration he replied that he did not welcome the proposal because he could accept no intermediary between himself and Ibn Saud other than Her Majesty's Government and because he believed that Ibn Saud would not deny him his full claim whilst arbitration might bring him less.( 89 ) Ali visited Ibn Saud immediately after the Dammam conference and again at the end of 1952. He denied that he discussed the boundary question with him but it seems possible that an understanding on the subject exists and that the Saudis will not commit themselves until their boundary with Abu Dhabi is fixed. 51. The attitude of Abdullah towards Ibn Saud during the earlier portion of the period under review was one of veneration combined with fear. The fear seems now to have disappeared and relations between Ali and the Saudis have during recent years been marked by great cordiality on both sides. The Adviser reported that Ali had told him after his return from Riyadh in January 1953 that the Saudis had talked to him about financing a railway line to link the existing Saudi railway with Umm Sa'id.( 90 ) At the same time the Adviser expressed the opinion that if Her Majesty's Government pressed Ali too hard on the question of allowances (paragraph 11 above) or other matters he might even think of federation with Saudi Arabia. (c) Persia 52. Persia refuses to recognise Qatar as an independent State and treats any Qataris arriving in Persia as Persian subjects. No incident has been reported during the period under review affecting relations between the two States. There are a number of Persian shop-keepers resident in Dohah. ( 83 ) I.O. to P.O.

The Ruler will not allow Hindus to reside in Dohah and there are very few Indians resident in the peninsula who are not in the employ of the oil companies. It has been agreed with the Ruler's concurrence that when an Indian Trade Agent is appointed at Bahrain he should represent Indian interests in Qatar.( 91 ) Meanwhile under an informal arrangement a member of the Indian Legation at Bagdad is permitted to visit Qatar from time to time to look after Indian interests (cf. chapter 2, paragraph 94). 54. A similar arrangement exists with regard to the Pakistani Legation at Bagdad but no representative from it has yet visited Qatar. A substantial number of Pakistanis are employed by the oil companies and the Qatar Government and some reside and do business in Qatar. Large numbers of destitute Pakistani pilgrims arrive from time to time with the intention of performing the pilgrimage to Mecca by land. They are not allowed to proceed by the Saudis and the Qatar Government are forced to house and feed them until the Political Agency can arrange for their repatriation. Representations have been made to the Government of Pakistan who appear to find it difficult to prevent the departure of these pilgrims. (e) The United States of America 55. Qatar is informally within the jurisdiction of the United States Consulate- General at Dhahran, and a Consular Officer from that place visits the peninsula occasionally. Visits are also received from United States warships. Since the termination of the Superior Oil Company's off-shore concession American interests are confined to their share in the Qatar Petroleum Company and the few Americans in that company's employ. VI.—Miscellaneous , {a) Jurisdiction 56. The question of jurisdiction in Qatar did not arise until negotiations between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Ruler for a concession began in 1933 (paragraph 26 above), when the latter wished to insert a clause in the agreement providing for the settlement of any dispute between the company's foreign employees and his subjects in his Courts under Muhammadan law. His Majesty's Government informed him that they could not accept this condition and he eventually agreed that disputes between British subjects, British-protected persons and the subjects of non-Muslim foreign Powers should be settled by the nearest officer of His Majesty s Government and that disputes oetween British subjects, British-protected persons and the subjects of non-Muslim foreign Powers, and his subjects or the subjects of Muslim foreign Powers should be dealt with by a Joint Court (Appendix D (i)). He made this agreement conditional upon the acknov/ledgement of his son Hamad as heir apparent which was accoided. In the letter replying to him (Appendix B) it was agreed that the subjects of the other Gulf Shaikhdoms ( who are British-protected persons) should come under his jurisdiction. 57. In 1937 a draft Order-in-Council based on this cession of jurisdiction was shown to the Ruler. He objected to certain points and demanded an assurance that the foreign Governments whose Muslim subjects came under his jurisdiction would not raise any objection. His own objections were met and he was informed in writing that he need have no anxiety in regard to objections by foreign Governments to his exercising jurisdiction over their Muslim subjects in Qatar provided he dealt with their cases justly.C 2 ) The Order-in-Council was issued on November 4 1938 but as it contained a number of drafting errors was replaced by another Order on March 9, 1939. An Order issued on September 5 1939, empowered the Political Resident to make Defence Regulations for Qatar. A new Order-in-Council was issued in 1949 to introduce changes rendered necessary by the transfer of responsibility for dealings with the Gulf Shaikhdoms from the Government of India to His Majesty's Government. r j 1 i i i? n tnFO P 4170/13 of March 7, 1951 (EA 1905/5 of 1951).

There was some ui npr^ons in the errmlov arranoement and it was a^Teed that it should not appl&gt; to persons in i ploy arrangemem ana u 'a* i n ^ted ( 93 ) A new Order-m-Council was of Petroleum Development (Qatar* Lm ^tea. rhanaes in iurisdiction issued in 1953 giving effect amongst other things to these changes m jun.diction. 59 Th^ Ruler has issued a Passport Law (paragraph o below) and Traffic Regulations He has been asked to amend the latter before they are applied to Ss subject to the Order-in-Council by a Queen's Regu at .om Municipal Bye- Laws made by the Dohah Municipality have , bee ' f 9^1 R puliation ( 94 ) Regulations have also been issued under the Orders-m-JLouncil regarding the appointment of Special Police Officers,(») Passport Control, Dangerous Drugs. Alcoholic DrinksO and Miscellaneous Services.( ) (h)' Facilities for the Royal Air Force 60. In 1932 the Ruler was asked for aeroarome facilities, primarily for use in an emergency bv Imperial Airways.! s ) He demanded a formal guarantee of protection which His Majesty's Government were unwilling to give and negotiations broke down. A landing-ground was marked out by the Royal Air Force near Dohah by dropping bags of chalk from the air and he was warned that if aircrait using it were molested he would be called to account. 61. In 1935 in the letter in which the Political Resident gave the Ruler a guarantee of protection on land (Appendix A) it was pointed out that to enable His Majesty's Government to implement the guarantee it was necessary that the Royal Air Force should be accorded certain facilities. This letter was not formally acknowledsed but it appears that the Ruler accepted the position as he raised no objection to the construction of a landing ground north of Dohah which was completed in July.C 9 ) No rent was paid for it. In 1938 the Ruler agreed to exempt from customs duties fuel imported bv the Royal Air Force for storage at Dohah. The Royal Air Force ceased to maintain the landing ground at Dohah after the last war. It was used for a time by civil aircraft and has now been abandoned. The Royal Air Force now make use of the oil company's and other landing grounds in Qatar as occasion arises without any specific charter from the Ruler. (c) Civil Aviation 62. In 1932 the Ruler refused to agree to the construction of a landing ground which was intended primarily for use in an emergency by Imperial Airways (paragraph 60 above). Under the 1935 oil concession agreement Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited were obliged to obtain the Ruler's permission on any occasion on which they desired to use aerial transport within his territories. This provision was modified in 1946 (paragraph 31 above) and the company constructed landing-grounds at Dukhan, Umm Sa'id and Dohah for their private use.. In 1949 the Political Resident called attention to the fact that His Majesty's Government had no control over civil aviation in Qatar and suggested that the desirability of entering into a civil air agreement with the Ruler should be considered.! 100 ) It was decided that as there was little prospect of the establishment of an international airport in Qatar and that as a formal agreement might involve His Majesty's Government in a number of expensive obligations a simple exchange of letters would suffice. Accordingly in 1951 the Ruler was induced to write a letter to the Political Agent Bahrain asking His Majesty's Government to assume ( 93 ) P.R. to P.O. 1642/34 of March 19, 1951 (EA 1645/5 of 1951) ( 94 ) No. 1 of 1952. f 95 ) No. 1 of 1948.

This arrangement was subject to review after five years. The Political Agent replied accepting the responsibility on behalf of His Majesty's Government. C 01 ) 63. In 1950 the Gulf Aviation Company (chapter 2, paragraph 126) established a regular service between Bahrain and Dohah using the old Royal Air Force landing-ground at the latter place. In October 1951 they had to abandon this service as the landing-ground in question was no longer considered fit tor use. In December 1951 Petroleum Development reluctantly agreed to the use by the Gulf Aviation Company of their landing-ground at Dohah on the understanding that a new landing-ground would shortly be constructed for ordinary civil use, and the service was resumed. The new landing-ground was not constructed and much discussion followed about future responsibility for the maintenance of the existing ground and the construction of a new one. It appeared that the Qatar Government were willing to undertake this responsibility but wished also to assume responsibility for operating the airfield and they refused to accept a proposal that a private company should lease and operate the existing airfield. In view of the expense involved Her Majesty's Government were unwilling to assume any responsibility for maintenance, construction or operating and a mission from the Ministry of Civil Aviation which visited Dohah in the spring of 1953 recommenaea that the Qatar Government should be allowed to undertake all such responsibility, subject to the following broad provisos: —{a) the Ruler of Qatar should consult the Ministry of Civil Aviation representative in the Persian Gulf on the technical aspects of operating the airfield or airfields; {b) Her Majesty's Government shomcl retain control of traffic rights, paying due attention to the interests ot the Rul^ r &gt; and ic) Her Majesty's Government should retain all international responsibilities in the field of civil aviation.( 102 ) A draft exchange of letters with the Ruler embodying these and other conditions was under discussion at the end ot together with draft Air Navigation Regulations which were to be annexed to the exchange.^ 03 ) Meanwhile the Qatar Government are maintaining the existing airfield at Dohah, which they took over from the oil company at the end ot 19^2, and have constructed some ancillary buildings there. id) Slavery 64 Qatar used to be notorious for participation in the traffic in slaves, and had links with the slave mart at Hamasah (Chapter 6, paragraph 96). Several cases were brought to Abdullah's notice while he was Ruler but redress was rarely obtained. Domestic slavery was also widespread and the same trouble arose over the employment of slaves by the oil company as m the Trucial States (Chapter 5 naraeraoh 139) Ali, after his accession and acquisition of wealth, was induced formally to abolish slavery and on April 10, 1952, issued a proclamation accordingly (Appendix E). 660 slaves were freed and compensation was paid to the owners. (e) Arms 65 Under the Treaty of 1916 the Ruler of Qatar is permitted to import such arms and ammunition as he may reasonably need, and his annual requ^ are minted as beins in his opinion up to 500 weapons. In 1948 Abdullah, who had not imcorted any arms since 1939, asked to be supplied with 1,600 rifles together with armoured vehicles mounted with machine guns and heavy guns.( ) It was decided onlv to supply him with 500 rifles and 50,000 rounds of ammunition. Since All's accession and the establishment of the Qatar Police demands received for tL siinnlv of arms have been reasonable and have been met. A large number of rifles which Abdullah had imported under the Treaty and hoarded were taken over by the Police to prevent their falling into wrong hands. At the time of the signing of the Treaty Abdullah issued a proclamation fnrhiHHina the imnort and export of arms and ammunition (Appendix F). In Mav 1950 llf isTued a proclamation forbidding the carrying of arms in Dohah except by^ his Pohce and bodyguard but this has never been enforced. In 1952 it PR F o.

In November 1953 the British Bank of the Middle East, with the approval of Her Majesty's Government, obtained the permission ol the Ruler to open a branch in Dohah. (g) Post Office 69 A Post Office was opened in the Political Agency at Dohah in 1950 and the work handled by the Political Officer's staff. In 1952 a postal clerk was posted to Dohah, where he continues to work in the Political Agency under the Political Officer's supervision. The Adviser has agreed to allot a site lor a post office in the town-building programme^ 100 ) 70. British stamps are used surcharged with rupee values only. In 1951 the Ruler wrote the Political Agent, Bahrain, asking that they should also be ' Qatar.' The situation was examined and it was found that as all the mail of Petroleum Development (Qatar), Limited, was dealt with at Bahrain and carried to and from that place under the company's own arrangements, there was not sufficient traffic to justify a separate issue of stamps for Qatar.( K ' 7 ) The Ruler has not returned to the charge and it is believed that he was not personally interested in the matter. {h) Telecommunications 71. In January 1951 Cable and Wireless, Limited, obtained a licence from the Ruler valid for twenty years for the establishment of telecommunication services between Qatar and the outside world, the provision of a telephone service in Qatar and the establishment of a public telegraph office in Qatar (Appendix G (i)). They undertook to provide one telephone free of charge for the Ruler's personal use and to transmit private telegrams free of charge for the Ruler up to a limit of 1,000 words a year (Appendix G (ii)). A public telegraph office was opened immediately and wireless telegraph and telephone communication established with Bahrain. An automatic telephone system has been installed in Dohah. (/) Medical and Quarantine 72. The Mission of the Dutch Reformed Church of America opened a hospital in a local building at Dohah in May 1950. They found themselves unable to maintain it owing to shortage of staff and handed it over to the Qatar Government in February 1952. The first British State Medical Officer arrived in Dohah in March of that year. Much was done to improve the existing hospital and it was decided to invite designs for a new one. A design was approved in the latter half of 1953 and work is expected to start shortly. At the end of 1953 there were two British doctors employed by the Qatar Government in Dohah. 73. The Qatar Government has not yet taken over responsibility for its own quarantine administration, and no special quarantine establishment has been appointed. Umm Sa id is the only port at which ocean-going steamers call and ( 105 ) P.R. to P.O. 280/15/49 of November 11, 1949 (E 14103/11110/91 of 1949).

The Qatar Petroleum Company are under an obligation to employ as many Qataris as possible and it used to be the practice for the Ruler's representative under the concession agreement to issue certificates to local Arabs seeking employment with the company that they were Qatar subjects. This practice was much abused and many persons who were not Qatar subjects were certified as such. 75. In 1951 the Ruler issued a Passport Law (Appendix H) requiring all persons subject to his jurisdiction entering Qatar to be in possession of proper travel documents bearing valid visas except where the necessity for this had been waived. The necessity for obtaining visas has been waived in respect of all persons to whom the law applies, provided they are in possession of proper travel documents. i ■ . (''•) P.R. to F.O.

The internal history ol the Iruciai States in ^ StTeras Kfte' 11 »' '•■&lt;&gt;' 'i •»••»»&lt;■»&gt; - of wars between the various States. 2. The number of the States has varied from time to ^6. When the General Treaty of 1820 was signed there were only five, but ^ t his descendants Chief Sultan bin Saqr in 1866 his domains were di y ld fd a mon^ who from time to time declared themselves independent of the ^mrbranch oithe family ruling at Sharjah. There are now seven States, ^ r ® e 'J^'iSdom and Khaimah and Fujairah, being sub-divisions of the or'g 1 .'^ ™' t u ev the other four Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ajman, and Umm al Qaiwain remaining as y were at the time of the 1820 Treaty. 3. Until 1934 the Political Resident at Bushire dealt directly with the Trucial States being represented at Sharjah by an Arab Re ® ld f ncy , .if ° C ® descended in one case from father to son and the latter helo it for ^ y . These Arab Agents were men of ability, influence and courage and served the purpose of the Government of India which was the maintenance ol relations with the Trucial States with the minimum of expenditure and trouble, though some ot them undoubtedly acquired too much power and wealth in the process. In lyJ4 the Political Resident found himself unable adequately to deal with the Iruciai States, the work in respect of which had greatly increased owing to the establishment of air communications through them and the negotiation of oil concessions with their Rulers, and transferred the responsibility for supervising them to the Political Agent at Bahrain. It was not however until 1939 that the Government of India agreed to the appointment of a British Political Officer to Sharjah and they only did so then with the greatest reluctance as they thought his life would be in danger. Even after that the post was usually left vacant during the hot weather when the Arab Residency Agent was placed in charge. Since 1948 a British Political Officer has resided permanently on the Trucial Coast and in 1949 the post of Residency Agent was abolished. In 1952 the Political Officer came under the direct control of the Political Resident and in 1953 the status of the post was raised to that of a Political Agency. 4. At the time of the Pirate Wars and for many years after Sharjah was the largest and most important town on the Trucial Coast and it was the headquarters of the officer in charge of British interests on the Coast up to the end of the period under review. The first Residency Agent was established there about 1823. During the present century its importance has greatly declined owing to the silting up of its creek and the weakness of its rulers, and Dubai is now the largest and commercially, if not politically, the most important town on the Coast. A decision was accordingly taken in 1948 to transfer the headquarters of the Agency to the latter place. Buildings for it are under construction and the transfer is likely to take place in 1954.( 2 ) 5. Although Her Majesty's Government's relations with the Trucial States were established and consolidated long before those with the other Shaikhdoms and the Perpetual Truce of 1853 may be regarded as the foundation stone of the British position in the Persian Gulf, these States have until recently been left almost entirely to their own devices. The policy of the Go vernment of 'India at anj^rate u ntil the conclu sion of a.Civil Air Agreement with ^rjVK in' 1was to avoid any kind of comm itment by land. In many cases Rulers who had acquired power by assassination were recognised as soon as they had established their position and the States were allowed to fight each other at will, provided there was no breach of the peace at sea, though action was from time to time taken on such occasions solely Pronounced Jasimi. Plural Jawasim. ('') The transfer took place in March 1954.139 to ensure the safety of British subjects. Even after 1932 although political officers interfered more to bring about the peaceful settlement of dynastic and inter-State quarrels no attempt was made to preserve order by force. In 1940 the safety of the aerodrome at Sharjah was imperilled by a war between Dubai and Sharjah and from 1945 to 1948 there were hostilities between Dubai and Abu Dhabi involving many casualties and incidentally the shooting up of a British Political Officer, but though in both cases every effort was made to bring about a settlement no attempt was made to compel the parties to keep the peace. 6. The Trucial Coast was not affected by the Second World War except for the shortage of supplies. Arrangements were made through the Middle East Supply Centre for the import in bulk of wheat and other commodities which were distributed by a committee of local merchants under the supervision of the Political Officer or Residency Agent. The margin of profit left over after distribution was credited to the Dubai Hospital Fund (paragraph 150 below). The Rulers contributed to the Fighter Fund and the Rulers of Sharjah and Dubai willingly granted to the Royal Air Force all the facilities they required without payment. 7. In 1948 the number of abductions into slavery and raids by tribal gangs on traffic on the roads leading into the interior, in which British political officers and oil company representatives were from time to time involved, led to the consideration of a proposal to raise a small force of levies for the maintenance ot law and order in the Trucial Coast. After prolonged discussion the establishment of such a force at the expense of His Majesty's Government was approved and it came into being in 1951. This step marked a radical change of policy, viz., the assumption by Her Majesty's Government of responsibility for the maintenance of law and order in Trucial Oman not only by sea but also on land. 8. In 1951 His Majesty's Government decided that in view of their responsibility for the external affairs of the States and their consequent liability to answer internationally for them they were under an obligation to take such steps as were possible, {a) to ensure that their internal affairs are conducted as efficiently as possible, and to prevent such abuses as could justifiably invite external criticism, and {b) to promote their progressive development in all fields. They accordingly approved a proposal for the formation of a Council of the Rulers of the States in order to achieve joint action by them in administrative and other fields. At the same time the Political Resident was instructed to encourage the Rulers to extend their control more directly over the territory of the tribes which could justly be regarded as owing them allegiance, but it was considered that action to this end should be taken in the first place by the Rulers themselves without the intervention of the Trucial Oman Levies.( J ) 9. In the instructions issued in 1953 to the new incumbent of the post of Political Resident the objectives of Her Majesty's Government in the Trucial States are defined as follows: — (i) to maintain their position on the basis of existing treaties and usage, (ii) to determine as soon as possible the boundaries between the Trucial States and Saudi Arabia in such manner as to establish the justifiable claims of the Rulers against Saudi encroachment, and to determine the boundaries of the Trucial States inter se and with Muscat: (iii) t0 f os ter zood relations and mutual co-operation between the Rulers with the ultimate object of achieving some measure of federation; (iv) to assist the oil companies in the exploitation of their concessions on land (v) to Tmnrov? the'administration of the States and in particular to bring about the expansion of the health services, the abolition of slavery and the development of natural resources.( ) 11.—Internal Affairs {a) Abu Dhabi if) ThP Ruler Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan succeeded on the murder of his , 10 e The ,0^ He did not commit the murder himself but was presumably nrivv toT as Saar had succeeded ™ murdering Shakhbut's father Sultan in 1926. The Shaikhdom of Abu Dhabi changed hands three times as the result of murders ( 3 \ F o to P R Desoatch 47 (EA 1017/3) of April 2, 1951. o f;8; J o r I : wch 125 (EA 1053/8) of July 24. 1953.

While in London he was mvited to attend Her Majesty's Coronation but left the country without notice before that event took place owing to a quarrel with his doctor. 11. The question of the succession is likely to prove a difficult o ne - In ^ past it has usually been settled by assassination. Shaikhbut was born in 1903 and may live for many years yet but his life cannot be regarded as a very good one. He hopes that his elder son Sa'id will succeed him, but the latter, unless he mends his ways, is likely to prove a most unsuitable Ruler, and the same is the case with most of the rest of the younger generation in the ruling family. Hazza and Zaid are the best candidates if they survive their brother. 12. Shakhbut has been bitterly hostile to the Saudis since they began to claim his territory and tribesmen and did not share the veneration of the other Trucial Coast Rulers for the late King Ibn Saud. He is on the worst possible terms with the ruling family of Qatar but very friendly with the Sultan of Muscat and the A1 Khalifah of Bahrain. He likes Shaikh Sa'id of Dubai but is on bad terms with the rest of the latter's family and regards the other Trucial Coast Rulers with a mild contempt. 13. The Abu Dhabi Shaikhdom is at present regarded as extending along the coast from the Khor al Odaid at the base of the Qatar peninsula to Hasian about 35 miles west of Dubai. Inland it includes the Liwah oasis and the greater part of the Buraimi oasis. Shakhbut's claims in the direction of Qatar extend a considerable distance north of the Khor al Odaid and include the port of Umm Sa'id (Chapter 4, paragraph 24), and he has not accepted the boundary between Abu Dhabi^aiid^Dubai which was defined by the Political Agent, Bahrain in 1949 (Appendix A), althougTi he had previously undertaken to be bound by that officer's decision and a slight amendm ent of,it in his favour, was made in 1952. This boundary runs from Hasian on the coast to Tawi al Ashush about 40 miles inland. The whole of the western and southern boundaries of the Shaikhdom are the subject of a dispute with Saudi Arabia which is dealt with separately (paragraphs 96-104 below). The boundary claimed by the Ruler at the Dammam Conference in 1952 is as follows: — (i) A line from Sauda Nithil (on the southern border of Qatar) to the southermost tip of the Sabkhat Matti (Lat. 22° 50' N., Long. 51° 40' E.) including within Abu Dhabi Aqlat al Rinth and Batn al Tarfa. (ii) A line from the southernmost tip of Sabkhat Matti to Al Oaraini (Lat. 22° 05' N., Long 53° 40' E.). (hi) A line from Al Qaraini to Umm al Zamul (Lat. 22° 35' N., Long. 55° 25' E.). The nomad Bani Yas, the bulk of the Manasir, and the Dhawahir tribes are regarded by Shakhbut as his subjects and he also claims a predominating influence over the Awamir nomads south-west of Buraimi. Before the Saudi aggressions of 1949 and 1952 he made no attempt to assert his authority in the outlying parts of his Shaikhdom, other than Buraimi, beyond sending a representative 1o Liwah annually to collect the tax on dates, but since then has readily responded to all suggestions made to him by Her Majesty s Government for action in support of his claims. Zaid has done much to consolidate Abu Dhabi authority in and around Buraim^ and in 1951 entered into agreement with some of the Shaikhs ordinarily regarded as owing allegiance to Muscat to negotiate with the oil company on their behalf. He was discouraged from proceeding with this proposal for fear of causing trouble with the Sultan of Muscat.%1 141 14. From 1945 to 1948 there was war between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. It began with a descent by Shaikh Rashid of Dubai from the sea on Khor Ghanadhah. As this was a breach of the maritime truce he was ordered by the Political Agent Bahrain to withdraw and complied with the order. Raiding and counter-raiding by land followed. Efforts were made to effect a settlement and in 1946 the Political Agent applied sanctions to the Ruler of Dubai by refusing travel facilities for his subjects and cancelling the call by mail steamers at his port in order to force him to return some looted camels and pay compensation. These demands were met but no final settlement was reached and hostilities continued. In November 1947 economic sanctions had to be applied to Abu Dhabi to obtain the return of some looted camels. In the same month a gang of Manasir which raided Dubai was practically annihilated losing 54 men killed. In April 1948 the Ruler of Abu Dhabi accepted responsibility for preventing further raiding in Dubai by the Manasir, peace between the two Shaikhdoms was restored and the sanctions which had been applied to Abu Dhabi were withdrawn. Three months later the Ruler of Dubai made a separate peace with the Manasir. Relations between Abu Dhabi and Dubai continued strained until 1952 when the Rulers became reconciled at the bedside of Zaid who was being treated for measles in the Dubai hospital. 15. Reference has already been made to the bad relations between Abu Dhabi and Qatar (paragraph 12 above) and to Abu Dhabi's claims in Qatar territory (paragraph 13 above). Qatar has recently laid claim to the island of Halul (paragraph 54 below) which has usually been treated as belonging to Abu Dhabi. Further in 1952 the Ruler of Qatar paid substantial sums of money to a number of Abu Dhabi residents to enable them to leave their homes and settle in Qatar. 16. Conditions in the Abu Dhabi Shaikhdom are still extremely primitive. The capital is nothing more than a large village and there has been no local development. The last surviving Hindu resident there was murdered m 1945 and it is interesting to note that his murderer was promptly arrested and executed by shooting. It is doubtful whether any other Trucial Coast Ruler would have taken such a strong line. {b) Dubai 17 Shaikh Sa'id bin Maktum, C.B.E., has been Ruler of Dubai since 1912. He was awarded the O.B.E. in 1934 and the C.B.E. in 1951. He was born in 1882 and for some years he has left most oi the affairs of his State to be dealt with by his son Rashid. Sa'id is a benevolent old gentleman, well-intentioned but not very strong. Rashid is able and astute but given to intrigue and not at all times trustworthy Sa'id is unable to control his relations and some of them including his brother Juma, who for a service rendered to the political authorities on some occasion has been granted a salute of one gun, have been concerned m the slave traffic and other villainies. He does however manage to maintain law and or er and a reasonably efficient customs regime in a flourishing port with a minimum of administrative machinery. The affairs of the town are discussed by Rashid from time to time with an informal committee and there are two State schools of a Quranic type. In 1951 an attempt was made to persuade the Ruler to improve his administration and establish a proper school, but the falling off of his customs receipts owing to the situation in Persia gave him an excuse for postponing action In 1949 he presented land for the proposed new Political Agency at Dub ai and for the Dubai Hospital (paragraph 151 below). He contributes Rs. 40,000 a year to the latter. 18. Dubai is the largest town on the Trucial Coast and the only port of any commercial importance. Its population was at on ^ tlme 1 ^ | ll 1 ' a ^ d , in , has declined since 1951 owing to emigration to the oilfields and m 1953 was probably under 20,000. It owes its prosperity to the navigability of Us creek and a Urveinflux of Persian merchants from Lingeh at the beginning of the century It is the principal market of the tribes of the Trucial Coast and for many of those of the interior The value of its imports for which payment was made through the ncal bank alone in 1952 amounted to about £li millions. It conducts an °xfensive trade with Persia, and when economic conditions are bad in that countrv as at present its prosperity declines. The Ruler recovers customs duties on all imports at 4i per cent, ad valorem. The mercantile community is largely Persian and in 1953 it was reported that many of the poorer c ass of Persian were Emigrating to Dubai owing to their inability to make a living in their own !

A portion of the boundary between Du ^\ a ' d ac^Dted bvSaTd by the Political Agent Bahrain in 1949 (paragraph 13 i n p hnl ^5 arv h y etw '^ and in 1953 negotiations were in progress for determining Dubai and Sharjah. The boundary inland towards the south-east is uncerlain, but it seems probable that the Shaikhdom does not exte 'f,.f or u 55°^ 0 in this direction. No nomad tribes owe allegiance to Sa id. He own , g ■ ° in Ras al Khaimah territory and the village of Hatta, or according to Lor mer Hajarain,( 5 ) in the Wadi Hatta on the borders of, or perhaps inside. Muscat territory. 20. In 1929 1934, 1938, 1939 and 1940 there were insurrections against Sa'id's rule led by his cousins. In 1938 he was forced to rule through a Majlis or Council, but in 1939 he gained the upper hand again and killed or expelled his cousins. The Majlis was reconstituted but ceased to exercise any authority and was so o n abolished. The cousins who were expelled were harbourec by Sharjah and the Political Agent Bahrain had to intervene to prevent a war between the two States which would endanger the safety of Imperial Airways and other aircraft (paragraph 125 below). He persuaded the Ruler of Sharjah to send most of the refugees away but early the following year they returned and attacked Dubai and on being defeated again took refuge with Sharjah. On this occasion Dubai declared war on Sharjah. Before any serious hostilities took place the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah intervened and effected a truce which in due course led to a final settlement. Since then there have been no further dynastic troubles apart from an alleged plot to murder Sa'id's son Rashid in 1951. The story of the 1945-48 war with Abu Dhabi has already been told (paragraph 14 above). In 1949 a launch belonging to Sa'id called the Joker which had been involved in the slave-traffic was seized at Bahrain and confiscated. It was not believed that Sa'id himself was concerned with the use to which the launch had been put but rather his brother Juma and other relations. In 1953 the Levies just failed to prevent the departure from the coast of a Dubai launch loaded with a cargo of slaves. Sa'id agreed to exile his cousin Khalifah bin Majid who had been concerned in this transaction. 21. The attitude of Sa'id and his son Rashid since the arrival of Turki in Buraimi has been outwardly correct and they have ostensibly complied with requests made to them by the political authorities. They are believed, however, to have considerable sympathy with the Saudis and to have connived at, if not organised, the supply of money and foodstuffs to Turki in defiance of the blockade (paragraph 102 below). They have nothing to lose as a result of the Saudi aggression and after Turki's arrival in Buraimi Sa'id with Rashid and Juma after performing the pilgrimage visited the late King Ibn Saud at Riyadh. There has also been much sympathy with the Saudis amongst the people of Dubai, to some extent because of the profit to be made from trade with them, and all the four qadhis of the town visited Turki one of them remaining with him in an official capacity. The latter was arrested by the Levies when he returned to Dubai and exiled by the Ruler. (c) Sharjah (with Kalba) 22. The Ruler until 1951 was Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr. When his father who 1T i r i^ W i as a minor . a nd the succession passed to his cousin Khahd bin Ahmad. In 1924 there was a rising against the latter as a result of which Sultan became u er. He was pompous and negligent of the interests of his people, hl s chief merit so far as Her Majesty's Government is concerned is that in 1932 of his own accord he oltered them air facilities when the other Rulers had apparently conspired to refuse them. Early in 1949 he became seriously ill and was flown to Bombay From here in due course he was sent for treatment to London where he died m 195 L During his illness he appointed his brother Muhammad to act for him, and when he died Muhammad orocl aimed himself Ruler This action was not approved by the late Ruler' Saqr and the enfor member of the Qasimi family were called in to adjudicate After a few weeks of oamlaar sSs^ refused to support either w^hrlVpw ^ ^ .Populace. On this Muhammad withdrew. His Majesty s Government s recognition was conveyed to Saqr bv the ( 5 ) p. 454, Lorimer, Vol. II.TO 143 Political Resident in a formal ceremony held at Sharjah on May 1, 1951, after Saqr had undertaken in writing to be bound by all the agreements entered into by his father, to spend the income received in respect of his oil agreement in the interests of his people and to accept the advice of the Political Agent in matters concerning the government of his Shaikhdom( 6 ). He was born in 1924 and owing to his close association with the Royal Air Force at Sharjah during and after the last war has acquired a more modern outlook than the other Trucial Coast Rulers and a smattering of English. Although he has an exaggerated idea of his own importance, he appears to take a genuine interest in the welfare of his State and people and should prove a good ruler. Like other rulers he has had much trouble with other members of his family over the question of their allowances. By 1953 he appeared to have pacified his brothers but had reached no final settlement with his uncle Muhammad, the previous acting Ruler. The latter had refused to accept what was offered him and paid one or two visits to Ibn Saud to publicise his dissatisfaction and obtain largesse. 23. As already related (paragraph 2 above) after the death in 1866 of the famous Sultan bin Saqr his domains were divided amongst his four sons and separate branches of the family were established at Sharjah, Ras al Khaimah, Dibah and KalbaO- Ras al Khaimah has at times been united to Sharjah but has been recognised as an independent State since 1921. Dibah and Kalba were for long virtually independent of Sharjah but were not recognised as such because there was no necessity for doing so. There was talk of establishing an airfield at Dibah in the early thirties of this century but it came to nothing, and when a separate Shaikhdom of Kalba was recognised it was regarded as being part of it. It is now regarded as being part of Sharjah though its Shaikh refused to admit this when the Political Resident visited the place in 1953. His Majesty's Government were compelled to recognise Shaikh Sa id bin Hamad as independent Ruler of Kaiba in 1936 in order to obtain the right to establish an emergency landing-ground there Sa'id died in the following year leaving a minor son Hamad and the people of Kalba elected Khalid bin Ahmad, who had previously been Ruler of Sharjah as Regent and he was formally recognised as such. Owing to increasing age and infirmity he in due course left the affairs of Kalba in the hands of a dissolute nephew called Humaid bin Abdullah. In 1948 the people of Kalba revolted against Humaid and agreed to the appointment of another member of the Qasimi family as Regent. Before he could be officially recognised Humaid succeeded m re-establishing his power. In 1950 he died and as Hamad bm Sa id had come of age the Regency was abolished and he was recognised as Ruler, one of he conditions of recognition being the payment of a pension to the ex-Regent Khalid.

The control which Sharjah exercises over this tribe has varied from time to time but the Ruler has in rece^ years been paying its leading Shaikh an allowance of Rs. 15,0 y ' . ^ i, Saqr's acquisition of Dhaid in 1952 from Khalid bin Ahmad ex-Regent of Kalba, to whom it had been surrendered in 1928, has greatly stiengthened his over the tribe. The western end of the Wadi al Qaur is claimed by Ras al aimah, Sharjah and the Bani Ka'ab but probably belongs to the first of these, as the central portion of the Wadi is undoubtedly owned by the Ras al Khaimah branch ot the Oasimi family. Kalba is separated from the rest of the Shaikhdom of Sharjah bv this Ras al Khaimah salient. The boundaries claimed for the previous Shaikhdom of Kalba were defined when Khalid bin Ahmad was recognised as Resent in 1937 (Appendix B). When Kalba was reincorporated with Sharjah in 1952 Shaikh Saqr, as stated above, undertook not to claim more territory from Kalba than that defined in 1937. He has taken this to mean that the whole of the area defined has been accepted as belonging to Kalba, which is not the case. It was only a claim which was recorded in writing and there is nothing to sigmty that the whole claim has been accepted by Her Majesty's Government. Kalba territory extends along the coast of the Gulf of Oman from Dibah proper to Khor Kalba, both inclusive, with the exception of one or two villages which belong to Fuiairah ( 10 ) The interior is shared between Kalba and Fujairah on tribal lines, the Naqibiyin owing allegiance to the former and the Sharqiyin to the latter. The boundaries inside the hills with Muscat and Ras al Khaimah are uncertain but the 1937 definition makes it possible to exercise some check on claims which Shaikh Saqr has made in this direction. 25. There is little to relate about the history of the Shaikhdom that has not already been mentioned. Shaikh Sultan was weak and vain. He did little for his people and failed to control the Bani Qitab who indulged in much highway robbery while he was Ruler. With the establishment of the Trucial Oman Levies and the enlistment in them of members of the tribe the situation in this respect has greatly improved. Shaikh Saqr since his accession has shown considerable promise. He has encouraged the development of the State school, for which a building is to be provided by Her Majesty's Government. He has taken steps, as yet ineffective, to develop Sharjah as a port and has permitted the Mission of the Presbyterian Church of America to open a hospital in his capital. He is on reasonably good terms with his neighbours except the Ruler of Fujairah, the independent existence of which State he has refused to recognise. There has been trouble in the past between the Qawasim of Dibah and their Shihuh neighbours, the last serious outbreak of fighting being in 1941 and further trouble in this area is possible. 26. Saqr's attitude towards the Saudis since their occupation of Hamasah has been one of detachment and he has concentrated most of his attention on his gardens. He has no doubt been anxious to avoid offending Ibn Saud. Many of the Bani Qitab including their leading Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali went to Riyadh and made their submission to Ibn Saud. Saqr when urged to take action on their return did nothing positive beyond stopping Muhammad's allowance but he subsequently reported that the latter had apologised and made his peace with him. He later stated that he had not restored Muhammad's allowance. Saqr now holds the fort at Dhaid and is in a position to dominate the tribe. Should the Saudis in due course make a definite claim to the allegiance of the Bani Qitab it is uncertain to what extent he would resist it.

The Ruler Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid succeeded his father peacefully in 1928. He resembles in appearance and manner an Arab of the desert. He possesses plenty of courage but is volatile and untrustworthy. He belongs to the Na'im tribe and is at feud with Saqr the Na'im Shaikh of Buraimi. He maintains good order in his territory and no incident worth mentioning has occurred in it during the period under review. In 1951 he invited Dr. (Miss) Hosman of the Presbyterian Church of America to establish a hospital in his capital but as she found conditions there unsatisfactory she settled in Sharjah (paragragh 25 above). In 1952 he started to issue his own travel documents, being the first Trucial State Ruler to do so, and made much profit by issuing them to all and sundry whether they were his subjects or not. His eldest son, Ali, who has an imposing figure and is fully competent, represents him when he is ill or absent and will presumably succeed him. Rashid is suspected of pro-Saudi sympathies and Ali is believed to have visited Turki in Hamasah soon after the latter's arrival there. 28. The State is a very small one. No attempt has yet been made to define its boundaries but it covers a few miles of coast and may extend up to 20 miles into the interior. In 1953 Shaikh Rashid objected when an oil company survey party operating West of Dhaid trespassed in what he regarded as his preserve. He owns a village called Masfut in the Wadi Hatta near the Dubai village of Hatta (paragraph 19 above) but it is doubtful if this can be regarded as part of his State. (e) Umm al Qaiwain 29 The Ruler Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid, M.B.E., succeeded on the murder of his cousin in 1929. He was then only 18 and was apparently not concerned in the murder himself. The actual murderer and an uncle who instigated him were lynched by the populace. Since then the history of the Shaikhdom has been entirely uneventful. Shaikh Ahmad, who is fat and suffers from diabetes, has a well- deserved reputation for honesty and lack of self-interest and is m great dema on the Trucial Coast as a mediator in disputes. He administers his State wise y and efficiently so far as his means permit and is always ready to assist Her Majes y s Representatives in the settlement of disputes and other matters when called upon to do so He is not affected by the Saudi claims and so far as is known has had no dealings with Turki in Hamasah though one or two of to have visited him. He was awarded the M B.E. in '950 His eldest son, Kasmo, ''Vo'' » ■!» Al All iribe v. u FTmm nl Ofliwain own Falai Al Ali an oasis about 20 miles distant who besides Umm al (^aiwam own rcuaj QhaikhHnm extends in the interior and a few lon'h^ jizhlt'af Hamrahto 'the north, a distance of about 15 miles and inland probably SandtecTudTng Falaj Al Ali but no bonndanes have yet been defined.

As Sultan had been an unsatisfactory Ruler and Saqr had usm-ped his position without bloodshed and been accepted by the P e op e ^ A p'f/J 11 the Political Resident recommended that the latter should be recognised as Ruler as soon as he had given an undertaking to observe all previous treaties and engagements, and authority was received to act accordingly. He gave e required undertaking^ 1 ) and was formally recognised on July 16, 1948. Though unimpressive he has much force of character. Since his accession he has co-opei ated satisfactorily with Her Majesty's Government and by somewhat drastic methods has established his authority over villages which were virtually independent in the days of his predecessor. He is accompanied on almost all occasions by his lather Munamrnad, a wise old man who probably exercises a restraining influence, and his elder brother Humaid, a rather colourless character whom it was at one time proposed to recognise as Regent of Kalba (paragraph 23 above). 33. Sultan did not willingly acquiesce in his replacement by Saqr and at once started to intrigue against him. In order to preserve the peace the Political Agent, Bahrain, thought it desirable that he should be removed from the Frucial Coast for the time being. He therefore summoned him to the Agency at Sharjah and asked him to accompany him to Bahrain, but he ran away firing shots at those who attempted to overtake him; some of these going dangerously near the Political Agent. He took refuge for a time at Manai'i near the Wadi al Qaur and from there went to Muscat. Eventually through the good offices of the Sultan of Muscat a settlement was reached with him whereby he paid a fine and spent a year in exile in Muscat territory. On his return from exile he established himself at Manai'i. He had for long maintained a post at Huwailat in the Wadi al Qaur itself, having been paid to do so by the Sultan of Muscat in order to protect the latter's territory from raids. Here he placed a barrier and collected tolls from motor traffic using the Wadi. The barrier has since been removed but he is reported still to be recovering tolls from civilian traffic in return for keeping the track in repair. In 1951 his son Saqr, presumably with his connivance, assassinated the Ruler of Kalba (paragraph 23 above). In 1952 after the Saudi occupation of Hamasah, Sultan is reported to have had dealings with Turki and to have sent him a present of camels. After his exile he does not appear to have intrigued further against Saqr of Ras al Khaimah but he maintained an independent position in the Wadi al Qaur while attempts were made to effect a settlement between him and Saqr on the basis of the payment of an allowance by the latter. A settlement was eventually reached at the end of 1953 whereby Sultan agreed to accept the status of a subject of Saqr, and Saqr agreed to pay Sultan an annual allowance of Rs. 16,000 and one-sixth of any future oil revenues. 34. It may be noted here that the Wadi al Qaur is the only route between the Trucial Coast and the Gulf of Oman which is fit for regular use by motor vehicles and that the question of establishing the ownership of the western end of it is a matter of importance. It is claimed by Ras al Khaimah, Sharjah and the Bani Ka ab. Historically the Qawasim probably have a good claim but in recent years the Bani Ka'ab have grazed in it without recognising any Qasimi authority and in 1951 when the Trucial Oman Levies located a post there they attacked it on the grounds that it had been established without their permission Whether the Bani Ka'ab are finally recognised as a Muscat or a Saudi tribe difficulties are likely to arise in keeping the Wadi open for traffic if their ownership of the western end of it is accepted. 35. Soon after his accession Saqr started having trouble with his tribesmen and his neighbours, who were possibly instigated by Sultan In 1949 he was involved with Rams, Bakhah, Jazirat al Hamrah and'the Khawatir In 1950 the Shaikh of Bakhah in Muscat territory attacked the village of Sha'am at the northern end of Ras al Khaimah territory and did much damage One of His Maiesty's ships visited the spot and effected a settlement. There was further trouble in Novemher and a warship a g ain visited Sha'am. On this occasion the Governor of Khassab sent the Shaikh of Bakhah to Muscat. He returned and in February 1951 again attac'ked Shaam. Saqr sent a large armed party to the place, and the Political Officer Trucial Coast and the Wall of Khassab also intervened. Efforts to reach an amicable settlement failed and the Shaikh of Bakhah was warned not again to enter Ras al khaimah territory without the permission of His Majesty's C 1 ) No. 14 IV. T.C.:'Xoi 147 Government or the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah. The Sultan of Muscat was also asked to restrain him and since then there has been no further trouble. In January 1951 Saqr made a sudden attack on the village of Jazirat al Hamrah capturing the Shaikh and his son whom he imprisoned for a few months and then released. In March he made a night attack on Rams and captured the Shaikh, but the latter's relations escaped. Rams had been more or less independent since 1922 as the result of an agreement then reached between its Shaikh and the previous Ruler, Sultan. In July 1952 an attempt was made to re-capture Rams by the relations of the imprisoned Shaikh with the assistance of the Shihuh. One of His Majesty's ships and a party of Trucial Oman Levies went to the spot on which the attacking party withdrew and the ringleaders surrendered. Saqr was then induced to release the imprisoned Shaikh but subsequent efforts to bring about a settlement which would allow the refugees to re-occupy their gardens at Rams have failed. 36. The State of Ras al Khaimah has about 40 miles of coast and extends along the western side of the Hajar range for about 100 miles. The boundaries claimed for it by Shaikh Sultan were reduced to writing in 1937 (Appendix C) and were accepted by Saqr at the time of his recognition. They have not been formally accepted by Her Majesty's Government and except perhaps, at certain points on the coast the boundaries of the State with Muscat, Umm al Qaiwain, Sharjah and Fujairah are everywhere uncertain. The Khawatir tribe are regarded as owing allegiance to the Ruler who pays them an annual allowance of Rs. 11,000. 37. So far as is known Saqr had no dealings with Turki after the latter's arrival at Hamasah. The leading Shaikh of the Khawatir visited Turki in Hamasah and a number of his tribesmen went on to Riyadh. Saqr failed to take any strong action against them on their return or even to establish a post in their territory in spite of an offer of assistance in this matter from Her Majesty's Government. He subsequently reported rather vaguely that he had reached a satisfactory settlement with the tribe. 38. Ras al Khaimah has in recent years been the least orderly of the Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms and its Ruler has had neither the opportunity nor the resources to develop his State. It possesses quite a large number of gardens ii rigated from springs and wells and is probably capable of agricultural development. (g) Fujairah 39. The Shaikhdom of Fujairah consists of a number of villages on or near the coast of the Gulf of Oman, occupied by a tribe called the Sharqiyin. The tribe was originally under Qasimi rule but since 1901 has successfully asserted its independence of Sharjah. The Shaikh's fort at Fujairah was demolished by naval bombardment in 1925 on account of his complicity in a slavery ca se - In the early part of the last war a notorious Persian slave trader, Mirza bm Barkat, for a time made his headquarters in Fujairah but was eventually expeliea by Shaikh Muhammad bin Hamad at the Political Resident s request. Since then Shaikh Muhammad from time to time sought recognition from His Majesty s Governmen as an independent Ruler, but his request at first did not find favour as i was considered undesirable to bring into being another P ett y ? however there appeared to be a danger that unless ^.haiKh Muhammad were brought into treaty relations with Her Majesty s Government he might seek the Drotection of Ibn Saud or otherwise cause embarrassment ana it was consideied accepted'alf the^treaties and agreements in force ^tween Her Majes^ and the Rulers of the Trucial States, and undcrtooknotogrant an oilconcesson withrmf r^rmicdon nf Her Maiesty s Government, to recognise Mer Majesty s without the permissioi i n the Trucial States Order-in-Council 1950, toTecognise the* rMit 0° Her Majesty's Government to fix the boundaries of his State an™ to ^ttle any disputes between him such assistance to the Trucial Oman Levies as might be requned by them.t ) Un ( 1? ) P.R to P.O.

In accepting the a ove con i ions e had asked for an assurance that so far as an oil concession was concerne e would be permitted to address any company whatsoever, and this assui ance was given him. Soon after his recognition he visited Saudi Arabia in order to interest the Aiabian American Oil Company in his territory but failed in his object. He also paid his respects to Ibn Saud, who appears to have shown him little favour He subsequently endeavoured to persuade Petroleum Development Trucial Coast Limited to accept a concession, but they only agreed to take an exploration permit. Muhammad is active and intelligent and exercises lull control over his tribesmen. Though illiterate he has much knowledge of Arab history and genealogies. He is related by marriage to the Ruler of Ajman and on bad terms with the Ruler of Sharjah against whom he is constantly intriguing. 40. Since the absorption of Kalba by Sharjah, Fujairah shares with this State the tract bordering on the Gulf of Oman known as the Shamailiyah. In 1950 the Political Resident reported as follows: — ' The area under the control of Shaikh Muhammad comprises Fujairah town and the surrounding area, including the mountains and Wadis to the west of it of which the most important are Wadi Ham and Wadi Najdiyana, the coastal strip extending from Kalba to Khor Fakkan, including the villages of Ghuraifah, Mirbah and Gidfah, and the coastal strip extending from Bidyah up to and including Diba-Ghurfah and the steppe and mountains to the west of it. Towards Ras al Khaimah Fujairah territory extends to Habbab, about two miles south of Khatt.'T 1 ) This description is a very rough one and it is possible that some of the territory mentioned may be claimed by other Rulers. None of the boundaries of the State with Sharjah, Ras al Khaimah and Muscat have yet been defined. III.—The Trucial States Council 41. In 1950 the Political Resident, after remarking that he did not consider that a formal federation of the Trucial States would be possible for many years to come, recommended the formation of a Council of Rulers which would meet roughly every three months for the discussion of matters of common interest under the chairmanship of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast.( i5 ) The Foreign Office accepted this recommendation and, while agreeing that the Political Officer should prepare the agenda for the meetings of the Council and play a leading part in the proceedings for the time being, expressed a hope that he would hand over his functions to the Rulers themselves in due course. They also instructed the Political Resident to keep the possibility of the formal federation of the States in mind and to report in due course, after the results of the initial steps had been seen, what likelihood there was of achieving it.( 16 ) 42. Two meetings of the Council were held in 1952 and two in 1953. A variety of matters was discussed, including domestic slavery, development schemes, travel documents, nationality laws, anti-locust measures and the re-incorporation of Kalba with Sharjah. The concurrence of the Rulers was obtained in some useful measures such as the prohibition of the sale of salves and the issue of traffic regulations but with the exception of Shaikh Saqr of Sharjah none of them took any really active part in the discussions or showed any initiative. It will be difficult to make any progress towards federation until funds can be obtained for the setting up of a central administrative office. Meanwhile the Ruler of Abu Dhabi has promised to contribute 4 per cent, of his revenue from any oil found in his territories to the Trucial Council for the benefit of the Trucial Coast as a whole and the Council has accepted responsibility for the administration of this fund if it materialises.

In 1948 the number of cases of forcible abduction into slavery which occurred on the Trucial Coast and of the shooting up of British officers and oil company personnel on the roads leading into the interior led to the active consideration of ways and means for preserving law and order and in 1949 consideration was given to a proposal to raise a force in the Trucial Coast the main functions of which would be (a) the suppression of the slave trade, (b) the maintenance of peace between the various Shaikhdoms, and (c) the provision of escorts for government officers.( !7 ) Subsequently the Secretary ol State for Foreign Affairs agreed to the institution of a Levy Force, the primary task of which would be to prevent trading in slaves but which would also be available in an emergency for the protection of British oil installations and Political Officers. Early in 1950 the Treasury agreed to the raising of a force of 70 men instead of 100 as had been proposed, and that the cost should be borne by the Foreign Office.C 8 ) It had originally been suggested that a nucleus for the force should be obtained from Aden but subsequently it was decided that better material would be available from the Arab Legion in Jordan. The services of a British Officer were obtained from that source for the post of Commandant togetner with two Arab officers and 32 other ranks on secondment, leaving the re ft ^ Jhe Torce to be recruited locally. It was decided that the force should be called the Trucial Oman Levies and that it should be located m the vacant Royal Air Force Levy Lines at Sharjah. There was much discussion regarding His Majestys Government's right to establish the force as there was no treaty which could be held to^over this and it was at first proposed that an attempt should be made to obtain the Rulers' consent to it. The ^htical Resident o^ected to this course of action and he was eventually instructed to inform the Ruleis orally oi tne proposal to raise the force and of the reasons for it. with the ,d ®a ^^afterjhis inforirod accordin^l^in September lls^whh Satisfactory results.( = '') Subsequently the establishment of the Levies was everywhere welcomed except at Dubai, where hwas feared that they might interfere with nefarious trading activities. ^ AA TV hrintr all members of the Trucial Oman Levies under His Majesty s • ■ : ^ . h _ matinc 0 f a King's Regulation for the 'establishment, jurisdiction and to cover the makm^ ot a t ^ Councjl for the recruitment, discipline and eontro o Regulation made under Trucial States was ^sued in ^ eAlishment of the Trucial Oman it in the f , oll f own ;§ ei il' (a) for the' maintenance of peace and good Levies and for their employment W) f urn i s hing escorts for British Political order in the Tr ' c ?^ re ( „ ard i n g arrest and search and empowered the Representatives, laid down rules re = f r tlle f orce . penalties were also Political Resident to make ru ' es , ^ t he force by persons subject to the prescribed for offences mber s of it ( 21 ) While the Regulation was in Order in Council who were , . the a pp r0 val of the Rulers should be draft form the Foreign 0ffi&lt; ? e .^ , t on the Political Resident's objecting to this, obtained to some oi its P r ° vl ® ffi ient t0 S end the Rulers Arabic copies of the it was agreed that it would ^^Xir subjects of the offences in respect of Regulation asking them t0 'J them they would be punished if they the force described in i J nd t ° J f Disc ip]ine under the Regulation were issued S m ';' o ' a IAp SSS x D, w., p .1,0 taed deHnlng the dui... of the force - . „ o^ nl lord an was assembled at Sharjah by the end of 45.

The Political Resident reported that, as a result of the establishment ot the Levies no case of abduction into slavery had been reported during e y a there had been a decrease in highway robbery.^ 1 ) 46. In 1952 the force was recruited up to a strength of 100 Posts were established at Rams and in the Wadi al Qaur and, after the arrival o urki at Hamasah, at Al Ain in the Buraimi oasis. 47. Early in 1953 a decision was taken to recruit the force up to a total strength of 500 in order to deal with the situation created by the establishment of a Saudi Amir in the Buraimi oasis and guard the Frucial States Irontier against further Saudi encroachments. Aden Protectorate Levies were brought in temporarily to make up the requisite strength and recruiting for the force was carried out urgently in Aden. By August the desired number ol recruits had been obtained and the Aden Protectorate Levies were released. In November there were serious breaches of discipline in one of the squadrons recruited from Aden and an attempt to arrest some of the offenders resulted in the murder of two British Officers and one Jordanian Warrant Officer. The murderers were arrested and the whole squadron was sent back to Aden and disbanded. In the latter half of 1953 the force was brought under the operational control of the War Office but it still remained under the administrative control of the Foreign Office.(' d ) A new post of Senior Army Officer, Persian Gulf, was created at Bahrain for the purposes of operational control (Chapter 2, paragraph 117). During the year a number of additional posts were established to watch the Trucial States' frontiers. The role of the Levies has thus been extended to include the protection of the Trucial States against external aggression. V.—Local Development 48. The Rulers of the Trucial States, owing to their lack of resources, have hitherto been able to do very little to improve the conditions under which their people live. Sharjah, Dubai and Ras al Khaimah possess rudimentary schools and the Ruler of Sharjah has made some ineffectual efforts to improve his creek. Elsewhere nothing has been done on the Rulers' initiative. 49. The British Government of India, with their policy of non -interference on land on the Trucial Coast, did nothing beyond opening a dispensary at Dubai in 1939 and providing the services of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon. Her Majesty's Government contributed to the cost of this measure but apart from this no funds were made available for local development until 1953. During the last war, however, a fund was raised from contributions obtained from the Rulers and merchants and from profits on the sale of cereals and other commodities to the local population for the establishment of a hospital at Dubai. The services of a British doctor were obtained in 1949 and the hospital was opened in 1951 (paragraph 151 below). 50. At the end of 1952 in view of propaganda spread by the Saudis regarding their intention to extend the benefits of education, agricultural development, &amp;c. to Buraimi the Political Resident recommended that Her Majesty's Government should build schools at Sharjah and Dubai and pay for a survev of the water resources of the Trucial Coast.( ) Her Majesty's Government accepted these proposals in principle and also suggested that the Red Cross Society should be asked to assist in improving the medical facilities on the Trucial Coast and that some financial contribution should be made towards a survey of the Dubai creek.( 27 ) Sanction was subsequently accorded to the building of a school at Sharjah and to a surve&gt; of the water resources at the expense of Her IVIajesty's Government. A water survey was carried out by Colonel Merrylees in the spring of 1953 with ( 24 ) P.R. to P.O. 1202/1/52 of January 2, 1952 (EA 1201/11 of 1952) n The War Office assumed administrative control in April 1954, financial responsibility remaining with the Foreign Office. 1 C F J ( 26 ) Tel. from P.R. to P.O. 66, Saving, of December 17, 1952 (EA 1084/478 nf 1QV) ( 37 ) P.O. to P.R.

The Red Cross society undertook to send a mobile dispensary to the Trucial Coast but it had not materialised by the end of 1953.( 29 ) In December 1953 Mr. Crawford of the British Middle East Office visited the Trucial Coast and recommended that money should be spent on the improvement of the water channels at Buraimi as well as on the provision of water for the coastal towns.( 30 ) VI.—Islands All the islands lying between the Qatar and Musandam peninsulas south of latitude 26° are. at nresent regarded as belonaine to Abu Dhabi except 51 I ie ismiius lying UCLWCCU UIC vatcu auva tituae zo are at present regarded as belonging to Abu Dhabi except- {a) islands lying within or adjacent to the territorial waters of othe^ States.

Las Hat Islands.— These islands lie about 8 miles oft ^eeoastof Qatar to the north of the mouth of the Khor al Odaid J nevdonment mentioned bv Lorimer. They have been marked by Petroleum Ueyeiopment (Trucial Coast) Ltd. as belonging to Abu Dhabi but are likely to be claimed by 57. Dalmah. —The island possesses potable water and is inhabited. The Ruler of Abu Dhabi keeps a representative on it, and it is his State s mam pearling centre. 58. Bani The Royal Air Force at one time maintained a landing -ground and petrol storage tank on the island but these have been abandoned for some years (paragraphs 113 and 116 below). 59 D as , —With Abu Dhabi's permission the Royal Navy use this island for gunnery practice. 60. Sir Bu Na'ir. —This island belongs to Sharjah. In 1936 the Ruler of Sharjah granted permission for the erection of a beacon on it for Royal Air Force purposes.( 41 ) So far as is known the Persians have never laid claim to it. In 1952 there was a rumour that they intended to send a party to it, but this proved to be unfounded. Golden Valley Colours Ltd. hold a red oxide concession for it from the Ruler of Sharjah. It (with Bu Musa) is regarded as being included with the British Empire for the purposes of entitlement to Imperial Preference.* 42 ) 61. Bu Musa. —This island is inhabited and is under the effective control of the Ruler of Sharjah, who flies his flag there on occasions. In 1951-52 his brother resided there as Governor. Golden Valley Colours Ltd. hold a red oxide concession for the island (paragraphs 157-158 below). The Persian claim to the island is discussed below (paragraphs 64-69 below). 62. Sirri, —The status of this island has remained unchanged during the period under review. It is discussed at length in a recent Foreign Office Minute which shows that Her Majesty's Government recognise the Persians' de facto but not their de jure ownership of the island.( 13 ) In 1951 H.M.S. Flamingo visited it in ignorance of its status and found a few Persian guards there. A protest couched in moderate language was received from the Persian Government^ 14 ) No reply was sent to it beyond an acknowledgement. 63. Tamb and Nahiyu Tamb. —The islands have been regarded as belonging to Ras al Khaimah since the later became independent of Sharjah in 192L( 45 ) Tamb is inhabited and the headman of the village is supposed to hoist the Ras al Khaimah flag whenever a ship visits the island, but requires keeping up to the mark. Shaikh Sultan made little attempt to assert his authority over the island and in 1935 removed his flag for a time (paragraph 31 above). The present Ruler is reported to be exercising more control over it. The Persian Gulf Lighting Service have maintained a manned lighthouse on the island since 1913 the consent of the Ruler of Sharjah (which then included Ras al Khaimah) having been obtained to its establishment (Appendix F). ■#of ( 39 ) P.R. toF.O. 1088/21/53 of May 5, 1953 (EA 1434/1 of 1953).

Persian Claim to the Tamb Islands and Bu Musa. —This claim is discussed exhaustively in the Historical Summary of Events 1907-1928( 4(1 ) and in a Foreign Office Memorandum of 1934.( 47 ) It is largely based on the administration of the islands by the Qasimi Shaikh of Lingah at a time when he held the position of Governor there under the Persian Government. When this governorship was extinguished in 1887 the administration of Tamb was transferred to Ras al Khaimah and that of Bu Musa to Sharjah. The claim has never been admitted by Her Majesty's Government and has been formally rejected on several occasions. 65. In 1930 the Persians objected at the alleged hoisting of the Union Jack on Tamb and Bu Musa. They were informed that as the islands belonged to Ras al Khaimah and Sharjah respectively there was no question of the British flag being flown on them.( 4S ) The possibility of inducing the Qawasim to sell Tamb to the Persians was considered at this time. The former were approached on the subject but refused to agree. 66. In 1933 and 1934 a number of incidents occurred. In the former year a Persian warship visited Tamb and landed a party which inspected the lighthouse^ In 1934 the Governor of Bandar Abbas and other Persian officials visited Tamb in a motor dhow. Subsequently a Trucial Coast dhow was seized by a Persian warship in Tamb territorial waters and on two occasions a Persian warship visited the island. On the second of these a party was landed. A vigorous protest was made and the Persian Government was informed orally that His Majesty s Government would as a last resort protect the interests of the Trucial Shaikhs bv force.( 4 ). It was feared that the Persians would refer the case to the Council of the League of Nations and the line to be followed was discussed but the eventuality did not arise. In 1935 the Persians protested at the grant of red oxide concessions for Bu Musa by the Ruler of Sharjah and sent a customs launch to the island. The protest was rejected. 67. After this nothing more was heard of the matter until the end of 1948 when the Persians expressed a wish to locate administrative offices on Tamb and Bu Musa In 1949 there were rumours first that the Persians were preparing to refer the case to the United Nations and later that they intended to occupy the islands bv force His Majesty's Government's attitude was once more clearly explained in a note from H.'s Majesty's Embassy at Tehran to the Persian Munstry of Foreign Affairs.! ,0 ) 68 In 1949 the Persians erected a flagstaff with a tin flag on Nabiyu Tamb.

Petroleum Concessions Ltd. obtained their first concession from Dubai in 1937. At that time the Standard Oil Company of California was also showing an interest in the Trucial States. The Political Resident was instructed to in orm the other Rulers in case of necessity that His Majesty s Government did not wish to have more than one company operating on the T ruciai Coast that th e y were therefore prepared to approve agreements with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. but were not prepared to permit negotiations with any other company.! ) 72. In 1949 all the Rulers except Kalba issued declarations claiming jurisdiction over the sea-bed and subsoil contiguous to their territorial waters.( ) Fujairah did not then exist as a separate State and its Ruler has not issued a similar declaration since its independence was recognised. Kalba has since been reincorporated with Sharjah and the point whether the declaration issued by the Ruler of Sharjah in 1949 now applied to its sea-bed has not been considered. The point is not of importance as in the Gulf of Oman the sea-bed shelves steeply and it is doubtful whether an oil company could operate in it beyond the limits of territorial waters. At present Petroleum Development (T ruciai Coast) Ltd. hold concessions for the sea-bed of all the States which have issued declarations except Abu Dhabi, the sea-bed concession for which is held by the D'Arcy Exploration Company. The Dubai concession, however, is not in their name but in that of their General Manager. 73. All the land concessions held by Petroleum Development Trucial Coast Ltd. are in much the same form. They provide for down and annual payments which vary and a uniform rate of royalty on oil when produced of Rs. 3/ - per ton plus as. 4 for certain customs facilities, and are valid for 75 years. As all the Rulers are under an obligation not to grant a concession for oil except to a person appointed by Her Majesty's Government! 51 ) the concessions were all formally approved by Her Majesty's Government before they came into force. They are accompanied by Political Agreements between Her Majesty's Government and the company. The contents of these were communicated to the Rulers of Dubai, Sharjah and Ajman who agreed in writing to accept the principles involved. They have not been communicated to the other Rulers. The Rulers mentioned above have also agreed to be guided by the advice of Her Majesty's Government in the exercising of the right of termination which they enjoy under their concessions, and not to enter into negotiations with a Bank for the opening of a branch in their States, a matter which is referred to in the concessions, without first obtaining Her Majesty's Government's approval. The latter undertaking has also been given by the Rulers of Umm al Qaiwain and Ras al Khaimah. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd. maintain a Local Representative at Dubai, who is responsible under the Political Agreements for dealings with the Political Agent and through him with the Rulers in respect of all the concessions which they are operating. 74. The sea-bed concessions vary in form. There are entirely separate concessions in respect of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. At Ajman one concession covers both the land and the sea-bed and at Umm al Qaiwain, Ras al Khaimah and Sharjah additions have been made to the original land concessions so as to extend their scope to the sea-bed. The Political Agreements in respect of the Abu Dhabi sea-bed concessions and the Dubai and Ajman concessions have been communicated to the Rulers and acknowledged by them. They contain clauses under which the companies concerned agree to accept and sea-bed boundaries eventually delimited and meanwhile not to drill or carry out operations likely permanently to affect the sea-bed outside limits to be fixed by Her Majesty's Government, and also to avoid intederence with navigation, fishing and pearling. Limits have been defined for operations in the Abu Dhabi sea-bed but not elsewhere. 75. Until a very short time beiore tne close ol the period under review no oil had been found in any of the States. All the concessions therefore remain in the form in which they were originally negotiated and have not been brought into line with the fifty-fifty agreements now in force in the oil-producing Shaikhdoms.

It may be noted that the Rulers other than Umm al Qaiwain and Fujairah have accepted responsibility for the safety of survey parties of Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd. in their territory and have undertaken to punish the culprits and pay compensation if such parties are attacked.( 55 ) A specimen undertaking is included in the Appendices (Appendix G). (b) Abu Dhabi 77. The Ruler of Abu Dhabi granted a concession to Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd. on January 11, 1939.( 56 ) The text of it had not previously been agreed with His Majesty's Government and there was some discussion about its terms but it was finally approved in its original form in May 1940.( ;7 ) The Ruler was not required to take cognisance of the Political Agreement^) between His Majesty's Government and the Company which was based on it. The concession covers the whole territory subject to the rule of the Ruler of Abu Dhabi and its dependencies and all its islands and territorial waters and provides that if in the future there should be carried out a delimitation of the territory belonging to Abu Dhabi, by arrangement with other governments, then the area shall coincide with the boundaries provided in such delimitation. There is a further provision giving the company oil rights in the Ruler's share of any Neutral Zone which may be formed adjacent to his territory. The annual payment to be made to the Ruler until the discovery of oil in commercial quantities is Rs. 100,000, but this sum is liable to be increased by 25 per cent., if the company does not discover a drilling location within four years and thereafter by a similar percentage every three years if the company does not begin drilling or surrender its rights. 78. A well was drilled at Ras Sadr east of Abu Dhabi in 1950 but no oil was discovered. Relations between the Ruler and the company at this time were not very happy partly because of the dispute over the sea-bed concession (paragrapn 79 below). ' Strikes amongst local employees, believed to have been fomented by the Ruler, occurred at Ras Sadr and the Royal Navy had to be called in to stabilise the situation. In 1953 another well was drilled at Murban near Tanf west of Abu Dhabi close to the frontier claimed by the Saudis, Oil was discovered but the company had not yet stated by the end of the year whether it was available m commercial quantities. From the autumn of 1951 until Apn westerrTand were restricted from operating in the area claimed by the Saudis ' n ' h ® weste ™ ®^ southern parts of Abu Dhabi territory the ownership of which was under dispute with the Saudis (paragraph 98 below). 79 In Tune 1949 the Ruler issued his declaration of jurisdiction over the sea-bed Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited claimed that their concession automatically gave them rights 'f ' he Dhflhi tprritnrv The Ruler refused to accept this contention and me dispute was SrfTSLrSo.*' provided to. i. «o«~ ZS place in Paris in August 1951 when it was included the subsoil of the territorial waters islands) but not the subsoil of the submarine ^^on guous with Abu Dham rmtdHp thp territorial zone Meanwhile the Ruler had on Uecemper z, ivdu granted a concessSn fo? his'sea-bed for 65 years to the Superior Oil Company, an grantea a concession ioi iiij&gt; n. i 000 000 down with an annual payment American company, onpaymenofRs. 1 the . proceeds of s ^ s ... r) of the same amount al Y'o a Political Agreement with His Majesty's The company had previously entered into the Ruler agreed in writing t0 Site' SS SSycoM not .fiord turtlrer m-eetment i» the .re., . , u.r Qnnerinr Oil Company of the concession the 80.

It is provided that when the territorial limits of the State have been determined the area covered by the concession will be coterminous with the limits so determined. The annual payment to be made to the Ruler until oil is discovered in commercial quantities is Rs. 30,000. . u • • ir^i icko A well was drilled in the Jabal Ali area west of Dubai in 1951 and 1952 but no oil was discovered. No further drilling in the State has yet been undertaken. 82 In June 1949 the Ruler issued his declaration of jurisdiction over the sea-bed. As in the case of Abu Dhabi (paragraph 79 above) a dispute arose between him and Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited over his right to grant a separate concession for his sea-bed, and it was agreed that it should be referred to arbitration. On April 24, 1950, the Ruler granted a concession for his sea-bed to the Superior Oil Company on payment of Rs. 100,000 down with an annual payment of Rs. 100,000 and a royalty fixed at one-fifth of the proceeds of sales. ( ) The company had previously entered into a Political Agreement with His Majesty's Government,^ 5 ) the principles involved in which the Ruler agreed in writing to accept. In May 1952 the company gave notice of the termination of this concession. The Ruler thereupon offered a concession for the sea-bed to Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited. For domestic reasons the company as such was unwilling to accept the concession and it was obtained in the name of its General Manager in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Heseldin. The agreement was signed on August 7, 1952, for a period of 60 years.( 66 ) It provides for a down payment of £15,400, an annual payment of £4,000 until oil is discovered in commercial quantities and a royalty of 45. 6d. per ton. Except for the provision that payments are to be in sterling the concession conforms generally with the land agreements held by Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited. There is no obligation to drill within a specified period. The Ruler accepted in writing the principles involved in the accompanying Political Agreement.( 67 ) At the same time as the concession was signed the arbitrators who had been appointed by the Ruler and Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited gave an agreed award based on the findings in the Abu Dhabi case (paragraph 79 above). {d) Sharjah and Kalba 83. The Ruler of Sharjah granted a concession to Petroleum Concessions Limited with the right of transfer to Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited on September 17, 1937.C') It covers the State of Sharjah, including all islands and territorial waters, except for the area being used by Imperial Airways and the Royal Air Force, and provides that when the territorial limits of the State have been determined the area covered by the concession will be coterminous with the limits so determined. Under a schedule attached to the concession the company is debarred from undertaking the work in two areas, Jabal Faiyah and the Wadi al Hulu, (which were considered unsafe) without the Ruler's permission in writing. The annual payment to be made to the Ruler until oil is discovered in commercial quantities is Rs. 40,000.0 Under the schedule the company is ( 61 ) No. 3 IV, O.A.C. ( 62 ) No. 4 IV, O.A.C.

This period was extended by six years in 1946 and by a further five in 1951 so that the company are now under no obligation to drill until 1957.( '') No drilling has yet been undertaken within the limits of the State. 84. In 1946 the Ruler agreed to the exploration by a geological party of the Jabal Faiyah area. The exploration was duly carried out under the protection of the Bani Qitab who would not allow any of the Ruler's representatives to accompany the party. 85. The Regent of Kalba granted a concession to Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited on December 20, 1938.( 71 ) It covers the territory subject to the government of the Ruler of Kalba and its territorial waters. The annual payment to be made to the Ruler until oil is discovered in commercial quantities is Rs. 24,000. There is no obligation to start drilling within a specified period and no drilling has yet been undertaken. The company entered into a Political AgreementC 2 ) with His Majesty's Government regarding the concession but it was not communicated to the Regent. The Ruler of Sharjah accepted the obligations devolving on him under this concession when Kalba was reincorporated with Sharjah in 1952( 73 ) (paragraph 23 above). 86 In June 1949 the Ruler issued his declaration of jurisdiction over the sea-bed. In 1952 Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited entered into negotiations with him for a concession for it but his demands were so exorbitant that they broke them off. They resumed them in 1953 and m November of that year, after they had agreed to increase the annual payment due under the concession of 1937 from Rs. 30,000/- (paragraph 83 above footnote ( )) to Rs 85 000/- ( 74 ) he signed a statement confirming that the concession covered a the sea-bed and sub-soil outside the territorial waters of Sharjah over which his jurisdiction extended or might extend in the iuture.( {e) Ajman 87. In 1939 the Ruler granted Petroleum Pevelcpment (Trucial Coast) Limited sole exoloration rights for a total of six years. This period was subsequently extended.

In December 1938 the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah granted^ an exploration permit to Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited for 2^ years in the first place. The permit was revised and extended in 1941. On June 21, 1945, the Ruler granted a concession to Petroleum Concessions Limited, with right of transfer to Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, covering the State Oi Ras al Khaimah, including its islands and territorial waters, and providing that when the territorial limits of the State had been determined the area covered by the concession would be coterminous with the limits so determined^ 8 ') There is a provision relating to the possible formation of a Neutral Zone identical with that in the Umm al Qaiwain concession (paragraph 88 above). 1 he annual payment to be made to the Ruler until oil is discovered in commercial quantities is Rs. 60,000. There is no obligation to start drilling within a specified period and no drilling has yet been undertaken. The company entered into a Political Agreement with His Majesty's Government in March 1938 in respect of any concession which might subsequently be obtained for Ras al Khaimah.( 8J ) It was not communicated to the Ruler. In 1946 the latter gave an undertaking regarding the opening of a bank similar to that obtained for Umm al Qaiwain (paragraph 88 above).( 84 ) 91. On August 26, 1952, the Ruler agreed in writing that the concession of 1945 should be interpreted as covering the sea-bed outside the territorial waters and the company undertook in writing to increase their annual payment to Rs. 90 ,000/-.ry (h) Fujairah 92.

In a subsidiary document the company have agreed to make the prescribed payments in Indian rupees for as long as the present freedom of exchange between the Indian rupee and sterling permits.( 87 ) Her Majesty's Government have not given their formal approval to the grant of the permit pending the conclusion of a Political Agreement with the Company. nding^ 11 VIII.—Foreign Relations (a) General 93. All the Trucial States have undertaken to conduct their foreign relations through Her Majesty's Government and none of them has shown anv desire to evade this obligation.

Before the period under review there was evidence of much interference by the Governor of Hasa in the affairs of the Trucial States and misgivings were felt regarding Ibn Saud's intentions in the area( 88 ) but until 1949 nothing occurred to justify these apart from the annual despatch by him of parties to collect taxes on camels belonging to nomad tribes in the outlying parts of Abu Dhabi territory. The Ruler of Abu Dhabi mentioned the visits of these parties in general terms to the Political Agent Bahrain in 1934 but made no specific complaint until 1948 so that for many years they did not come to the notice of His Majesty's Government. In 1948 and again early in 1949 their violations of Abu Dhabi territory were brought to the notice of the Saudi Arabian Government but no formal protest was made,as all or most of the nomads concerned were believed to owe allegiance to Ibn Saud and it was not desired to re-open the boundary dispute. In 1950 when the dispute had been reopened a formal protest was made.C') This was met by a denial that there had been any trespass and a counter-protest against Abu Dhabi's interference with the Manasir. 95. During the period 1934 to 1938 attempts were made to negotiate with Ibn Saud the boundaries of his territory with the Trucial States, Qatar and Muscat, and it is possible that a satisfactory settlement might have been reachea on the basis of the ' Riyadh Line ' which secured most of the requirements ot the Mates for which His Majesty's Government were negotiating had it been possib e to cede to him Jabal Nakhsh in the Qatar peninsula or the Khor al Odaid, which had been officially recognised as long ago as 1878 as bem S vV / v 1l ?T k Maiestv's territory and in respect of which a pledge had been given y^ J Y Government in 1906 that they were willing to prevent its occ ^^ else but Abu Dhabi.

In September the Saudis replied accepting some but not all of the conditions.! ) In October they objected to some operations which Petroleum Development, Trucial Coast, were carrying out in the western part of Abu Dhabi territory which was claimed by them. A reply was sent refusing to restrict the company s activities in this area.( !,lS ) Correspondence and discussion followed about the setting up of a fact-finding commission and in February 1951 the Saudis agreed with one exception to proposals which His Majesty's Government had uiade about the formation of such a commission and the procedure it should adopt.(') 97. About this time Ibn Saud protested strongly against the employment of men from the Arab Legion to form a nucleus for the Frucial Oman Levies. He also renewed his objections to the undertaking of operations by Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast), Ltd., in the disputed area. It was decided to ignore the former protest but in February 1951 the oil company were asked for the time being to refrain from operating in Abu Dhabi territory west of longitude 53° SCX E. 98. In May 1951 the Saudi Arabian Ambassador in London suggested that the Amir Faisal should be invited to London for a discussion of the boundary and other disputes outstanding between His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Arabian Government. This proposal was accepted and discussions took place in London in August. So far as the boundary dispute was concerned it was agreed that {a) in order to fix the boundaries, a meeting should take place between the parties in the near future and that the Rulers of Abu Dhabi and Qatar should attend it; {b) in the meanwhile oil companies and the Trucial Oman Levies should not be allowed to operate in the disputed areas; and (c) if necessary a commission might be chosen to collect information which the parties to the meeting under {a) might require.( ino ) 99. The proposed conference opened at Damman in Saudi Arabia on January 28, 1952. The British delegation was led by the Political Resident and the Saudi Arabian by the Amir Faisal. The Rulers of Abu Dhabi and Qatar attended in person. These Rulers stated their claims and some discussion followed, but the Saudis refused in any way to modify their 1949 claim, and pressed for the appointment of a fact-finding commission. The conference was adjourned indefinitely on February 14 without any progress having been made in the settlement of the dispute, and it was agreed that the restrictions on the operations of the oil companies and the Trucial Oman Levies in the disputed area would continue to apply pending further discussions. 100. It was found impossible to resume the conference before the hot weather and meanwhile a Political Officer was deputed to visit Liwah and other disputed areas and report on the conditions prevailing there and the allegiances of the inhabitants. His detailed report was received in September^ 101 ) 101. During the summer some of the Shaikhs of the Buraimi area had visited Ibn Saud and accepted Saudi nationality. On August 31 Turki bin Ataishan with about 40 armed men having passed through undisputed Abu Dhabi territory arrived at Hamasah in the Muscat part of the Buraimi oasis and set himself up as Saudi Governor there. A small party of the Trucial Oman Levies was sent to one of the Abu Dhabi villages in the Buraimi oasis, and Royal Air Force aircraft carried out reconnaissances over the area. Muscat forces were preparing to advance on Buraimi but the Sultan was asked to hold his hand (chapter 6, paragraph 42) and in November a standstill agreement was reached with the Saudis whereby the forces already in Buraimi were to remain there but were not to be reinforced and life in the oasis was to revert to normal, pending negotiations for a peaceful settlement. With the consent of the Rulers of Abu Dhabi and the Sultan of Muscat, given very reluctantly by the latter. Her Majesty's Government then proposed tha'tlhe whole ( 96 ) Tel. from Jedda to F.O. 151 of May 28, 1950 (ES 1081 /39 of 1950) ( 97 ) Jedda to F.O. Despatch 98 of July 25, 1950 (ES 1081 /59 of 1950).

It was renewed in January 1953. 102. In spite of the standstill agreement Turki continued to intrigue with the tribes and there were numerous protests by Her Majesty's Government and counter-protests by the Saudis. In order to safeguard the interest of the Trucial States it was accordingly decided to bring the strength of the Trucial Oman Levies up to 500 and during the period of recruitment and training of the additional personnel to reinforce them with Aden Protectorate Levies, and also to station some armoured cars in the Trucial Coast. These reinforcements began to arrive in January 1953. During that month a 'party of Bani Ka'ab carrying a Saudi flag attacked a Levy Post in the Wadi al Qaur. The attack was easily beaten off. In March a tax-collector called Ibn Mansur arrived at Buraimi with 38 armed men. In view of these and other breaches by the Saudis of the standstill agreement on April 2 Her Majesty's Government informed the Saudi Arabian Government that thev would no longer consider this agreement or the 1951 agreement restricting the operations of the oil companies and the Trucial Oman Levies (paragraph 95 above) as operative.! 102 ) Additional troops were at once sent to the Buraimi oasis and a loose blockade of Hamasah was established in order io prevent the tribesmen having access to Turki. Posts were also established m western Abu Dhabi territory and Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd. were mlormed that they were free to operate in the disputed area. The position locally remained unchanged until the end of 1953. 103 In the note of April 2 to the Saudi Arabian Government the offer ot arbitration was once ?nore^ renewed.

One of the officials jumped into the sea and the other was arrested and released when the Trucial Coast was reached. A protest was received irom the Persian Government, but the incident appears subsequently to have been iorgotten due to the emergence of more serious disputes with that Government. 107. There is a large Persian element in Dubai and relations between Arabs and Persians on the Trucial Coast are usually friendly. (d) India and Pakistan 108. The Governments of India and Pakistan have shown little interest in the Trucial Coast since the transfer of power. It has been agreed that members of the Indian and Pakistani Legations in Bagdad may visit the Trucial Coast to enquire into the welfare of their nationals there but the only such visit paid was one by the Indian Charge d'Affaires at Bagdad in February 1952. There is considerable trade between Dubai and India and there are a number of Indian shopkeepers in Dubai, who are well treated and on good terms with the local Arabs and Persians. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited employ some Indians and Pakistanis. In 1949 a Pakistani anti-locust team operated in the Trucial Coast for a few months, and in 1950 a combined Indian and Pakistani anti-locust delegation visited the area. (e) The United States of America 109. The Trucial States are informally within the Consular area of the United States Consul-General at Dhahran. Since the abandonment by the Superior Oil Company of their Abu Dhabi sea-bed concession in 1952 American interests are limited to their share in Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited and such American personnel as it may employ, and the small Mission at Sharjah (paragraph 25 above. American warships pay frequent visits to the port, as each ship spends only four months in the Persian Gulf at a time (Chapter 2, paragraph 102) and during this period Commanding Officers wish to see as much of it as possible. 110. The United States Government have taken a close interest in the boundary dispute with the Saudis. Ibn Saud on several occasions discussed the situation with their Ambassador at Jedda, and although they have shown no desire to mediate and appear anxious to refrain from any kind of direct intervention they have from time to time expressed views on the subject to Her Majesty's Government. iX.—Miscellaneous id) Jurisdiction 111. The question of obtaining a cession of jurisdiction from the Trucial Coast Rulers was first raised in 1939 but was dropped because the Political Resident reported that the Rulers were under the impression that His Majesty's Government already enjoyed jurisdiction. At the end of the last war, in view of expected activities on the part of Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, it was considered essential to put the matter on a proper footing. All the Rulers were accordingly asked to give their formal consent to the exercise by His Majesty's Government of jurisdiction over British subjects and all foreigners, and all replied according their consent (Appendix I (i) to viii). It should be noted that the term ' foreigners ' is not interpreted as including subjects of other Trucial Shaikhdoms, e.g., a subject of Dubai arrested for an offence in Sharjah would be dealt with by the Ruler of the latter place and not by the Political Agent. Re-affirmation of the cession of jurisdiction has been included in the undertakings obtained from new Rulers also have been recognised since the original cession/ When Fujairah was recognised as a separate Shaikhdom in 1952 its Ruler undertook to recognise the jurisdiction of Her Majesty's Government over the persons and matters set out under Article 8 of the Trucial States Order in Council, 1950 112. The first Trucial States Order in Council was issued in 1946 after the cession of jurisdiction by all the Rulers. This was replaced bv a new Order in Council in 1949 to provicie for changes in the judicial arrangements that were considered desirable after His Majesty's Government had taken over responsibility ! i»ar&gt;, -I 163 a small maintenance party ( 108 ) No. 1 of 1951.

A further order was issued in 1952 to provide for the disappearance of Kalba as a separate State and the addition of Fujairah. Regulations have been issued under the Orders in Council dealing with the Trucial Oman Levies,C 0 ' 1 ) Miscellaneous Services by Her Majesty's Representatives, Traffic in Cultured Pearls, Air Navigation, Passport Control,( l07 ) Alcoholic Drinks and Special Police Officers.( ,0N ) m (b) Facilities for Royal Air Force 113. In 1927 the Trucial Coast Rulers were asked to allow the Royal Air Force to rent buildings in their towns for the storage of petrol, but they all refused permission.! 109 ) Opposition was encountered in particular from the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, whose attitude was extremely contumacious. In 1930 he refused to allow the Royal Air Force to moor a petrol barge in his creek and only gave way after some Ras al Khaimah pearling dhows had been seized by the Royal Navy. He then agreed in writing to accept responsibility for the safety of the barge and of all aircraft landing at Ras al Khaimah.( 110 ) Even after this he continued to give trouble, and early in 1931 he threatened to place himself under the protection of Ibn Saud, if further pressure were brought to bear on him. The ruler of Abu Dhabi likewise refused to agree to the installation of a petrol tank on Bam Yas Island. He was informed that one would be installed without his permission and action was taken accordingly. 114. In 1932 His Majesty's Government obtained facilities for the establish ment of an Air Station by Imperial Airways at Snarjah (paragraph 122 below). Although it is not specifically stated in the agreement that the Royal Air Force may use the station, this is implied by a provision that no charge will be made tor Royal Air Force aircraft landing at Sharjah. 115 In 1934 the Ruler of Dubai agreed in writing to provide a ' good jolly- boat ' for the storage of petrol by the Royal Air Force for a period ot six years on payment of a rent of Rs. 120/- a month.( J11 ) This agreement was terminated in 1941.( 112 ) 116. In 1935 the Ruler of Abu Dhabi at length agreed to grant facilities for the Royal Air Force on Bani Yas island and at Abu Dhabi,( ) and landing grounds were constructed at both places. The agreement was ^ a Period o tweWe^ears and stipulated a down payment of Rs. 5,000/- and a mon y p y This agreement was terminated at the beginning o 117.

After the war ^^^camps at Sharjah. The position was regularised164 by an exchange of letters (Appendix J (i) c (ii)) which accompanied the Civil Air Agreement of 1951. Under them the Royal Air Force are granted priority m the use of any aerodrome established in Sharjah territory tree ol charge, and the Ruler receives Rs. 500/- a month rent for the land occupied by the Royal Air l^orce camps for so long as it is required, together with the pay ot a stated number of guards for the protection of the camp. The rent was paid with effect August 15, 1945, the date of the cessation of hostilities with Japan. It should be noted that if the Royal Air Force at any time declare any of their buildings at Sharjah surplus to their needs they will so far as immovables are concerned become the property of the Ruler.( 115 ) 120. In 1942 Pan-American Airways, who were working under the direction of the United States Army, were permitted to make use of the Royal Air Force facilities at Sharjah with the consent of the Ruler. In 1944, when the Americans wished to construct additional accommodation themselves there, it was recom mended that the work should be carried out by the Royal Air Force so as not to prejudice His Majesty's Government's exclusive position on the Trucial Coast.( 116 ) So far as is known the construction was never undertaken. 121. After the arrival of Turki in Buraimi in August 1952 (paragraph 101 above) the Royal Air Force carried out many reconnaissances with aircraft based on Sharjah and subsequently constructed landing grounds in the Abu Dhabi Zone of the Buraimi oasis and near the Qatar-Abu Dhabi frontier. They were in charge of the operations on the Trucial Coast for so long as the Aden Protectorate Levies, which are under their control, were used to reinforce the Trucial Oman Levies. (c) Civil Aviation 122. In 1928 the Cabinet approved a decision to develop a strategic air route on the Arabian shore and a civii route on the Persian shore of the Gulf. In 1931 when it became clear that the Persian Government were unlikely to renew the permission for the civii air route over their territory which expired in 1932 it was decided that arrangements must be made at once for the establishment of a civil air route along the Arabian shore of the Gulf and that for this purpose some intermediate landing-ground must be found between Bahrain and Gwadur.( 117 ) The Political Resident was accordingly instructed to enter into negotiations with the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah and, it he refused the facilities asked for, with the Ruler of Dubai. Ras al Khaimah had been giving much trouble for some years over facilities required for the Royal Air Force and at once adopted an intransigent attitude. Dubai was somewhat more forthcoming but eventually pleaded his inability to grant the required facilities owing to trouble he was having at the time with his relations. The deadlock was suddenly resolved in March 1932 when the Ruler of Sharjah wrote to the Residency Agent offering facilities for both landplanes and flying-boats. A preliminary agreement was signed in May and a final one in July. This agreement was made for eleven years with His Majesty's Government^ 118 ) It granted facilities to the Imperial Airways Company and provided amongst other things for the building of a rest house by the Ruler for the passengers and staff ot the company. A landing ground was constructed and brought into use by the company in the following October. The rest house was built in the form of a fort and has since been regarded as the principal outward and visible sign of British authority in the Trucial Coast. It was in fact constructed by His Majesty's Government and its cost was recovered from rent due to the Ruler. Under the agieemcnt the Ruler was to receive pay for certain suards supplied by him, rent for the air station and rest house, a' personal subsidy of Rs. 500/- a month and a landing fee of Rs. 5/- for every commercial aeroplane landing on the aerodrome. No charge was to be made for Royal Air Force aircraft In a separate document (Appendix K) the Ruler was given a number of assurances in which amongst other things his independence was assured and he promised that British India Steam Navigation Company's mail steamers would call at Shariah The company had been consulted before this assurance was given and agreed to May^6 1948)' SaVing ' fr0m P ' R ' t0 A - 0 - C -.

No reaffirmation of these assurances was asked for by the Ruler when the Civil Air Agreement oi 1951 was signed but on the other hand they have never been withdrawn and must presumably be regarded as still in force. The 1932 agreement contained no mention of the installation of a wireless station. The Ruler was subsequently informed that it was proposed to erect one. He objected that it was not mentioned in the agreement and was given ' a suitable soothing reply.'( 120 ) 123. In 1936 alter prolonged negotiations involving the recognition of Kalba as an independent State (paragraph 23 above), its Ruler entered into an agreement granting facilities for a landing-ground for a period of 12 years in return for a payment of Rs. 400/- a month.( 12J ) It was not stated whether the facilities were to be enjoyed by civil or Royal Air Force aircraft and the agreement was presumably intended to cover both. A landing-ground was constructed for emergency purposes only. As it was no longer required in 1948, the agreement was not renewed when it expired in that year. 124. In 1937 the Ruler of Dubai entered into an agreement for the establishment of a landing base on the Dubai creek by Imperial Airways who wished to introduce a flying-boat service.( J ') Its period was for one year and the Ruler was to receive Rs. 440/- a month rent, which was to include the pay of guards, and a landing charge of Rs. 5 / - for any aircraft. In 1938 a further agreement was entered into with the Ruler for a period of five years.( 123 ) It followed the lines of the previous agreement except that the rent was raised to Rs. 940/- a month. 125. In 1938, 1939 and 1940 there were internal troubles in Dubai which led in 1940 to hostilities between Dubai and Sharjah (paragraph 20 above). In order to ensure the safety of the Sharjah landing-ground and the Dubai marine landing- base the Political Agent, Bahrain, used every means short of actual force on each occasion to effect a settlement and restore law and order—the earliest concrete instance of the change of policy which the establishment of landing-grounds in the Trucial Coast entailed. In 1938 flying-boats were diverted to Ras al Khaimah as it was held that their landing there was covered by the agreement obtained from its Ruler in 1930 (paragraph 113 above). Rather surprisingly the Ruler not only raised no objection but afforded every assistance. The war of 1940 between Dubai and Sharjah did not interfere with air traffic as it was of a static nature and only lasted for a few weeks. 126. In 1941 in the special circumstances of the war permission was granted for the landing of individual flights of Dutch (K.L.M.) commercial aircraft at Sharjah. 127. In 1943 the Rulers of Dubai and Sharjah both agreed to the renewal of their Civil Air Agreements for a further period oi five yeais. The latter made a request for more rent, which was not granted, and also called attention to the fact that, in spite of His Majesty's Governments undeitakmg (paragraph above), no mail steamer had called at Sharjah for nearly a year.( ) This matter was rectified. 128. In 1946, as a result of the signature of the Chicago Air Agreements by His Majesty's Government, it became necessary to ask all the Guif Rulers to grant rights to foreign aircraft. Sharjah and Dubai were asked to agree to His Majesty s Government 's according such rights to foreign aircraft on their behal as they might consider necessary and the other Trucial States' Rulers were asked to accoro the same rights'o foreign aircraft which fly over or land in their territory as were accorded by His Majesty's Government under mternational agreemen to ore.gn aircraft which might fly over or land in British terntory.( ) All the Rulers agreed. 129. In 1946 the subsidy payable to the Ruler of Sharjah under the Civil Air Agreement was inrreased to Rs 800/- a month and the landing ree to Ks. iu/ tor each aircraft Increases were also made in the rent and the pay of the guards.166 130. The British Overseas Airways Corporation s flying-boats services through the Persian Gulf ceased in 1947 but, as it was desired to retain mooring facilities in the Dubai creek for use in case of emergencies, the Dubai Civil Air Agreement was renewed in 1948 for a period of three years, the payment under it to the Ruler being reduced from Rs. 940/- to Rs. 600/- a month. It was not renewed again when the period expired in 1951. 131. In 1948 International Aeradio, Ltd., took over from the British Overseas Airways Corporation responsibility for telecommunications and the management of the rest-house at Sharjah. 132. In 1948 the Sharjah Civil Air Agreement of 1932 which had been renewed for five years in 1943 expired. Before its expiry the preparation ot a new Civil Air Agreement was taken in hand but, owing to the amount ol discussion this involved and the illness of the Ruler, the Agreement was not signed until November 15, 1951. Notice of renewal of the old Agreement was given three months before its expiry and accepted by the Ruler, and it was regarded as being in force until the new agreement was signed. 133. The Agreement of 1951, which is valid for ten years and renewable at the option of Her Majesty's Government on giving three months' notice, granted exclusive civil aviation rights in Sharjah to His Majesty's Government and provided for the appointment by His Majesty's Government of agents to exercise these rights, and for the grant or refusal by His Majesty's Government of certain specified privileges to aircraft of all nationalities^ 126 ) The financial provisions covered increased pay for guards, monthly rents of Rs. 1,420/- for the aerodrome, which had recently been extended, and of Rs. 1,000/- for the rest-house, a personal subsidy Rs. 1,000/- a month and a landing fee of Rs. 10/- for each commercial aircraft. The agreement was accompanied by Air Navigation Regulations which were made by the Ruler and applied to persons subject to His Majesty's jurisdiction by a Queen's Regulation^ 127 ) The various requirements of the Regulations were to be enforced by an ' authorised person ' to be nominated by His Majesty's Government. International Aeradio, Ltd., have been appointed as agents under the agreement and the Political Agent and the local Manager of International Aeradio, Ltd., as ' authorised persons ' under the Regulations. 134. The Sharjah aerodrome was originally constructed for civil purposes but in 1950 the Royal Air Force extended it to make it suitable for their jet aircrafU 128 ) It is classified as 'joint user.' The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation are responsible for its management and the provision of most facilities and the Air Ministry for its maintenance and for providing fire-fighting apparatus and an ambulance. It is not an international aerodrome but comes in the category of aerodromes made available for international use by special arrangement with Her Majesty's Government. 135. The oil companies operating in the Trucial Coast have the right under their concessions to construct airfields for their own purposes subject to Her Majesty's Government's approval. Such airfields have been constructed by Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast), Ltd., in Dubai and Abu Dhabi territory. Their use is ordinarily restricted to aircraft engaged in the companies' business, but Royal Air Force aircraft use them when occasion arises. 136. Her Majesty's Government enjoy exclusive civil aviation rights in Sharjah only and have at present no power to control civil aviation in any of the other Trucial Shaikhdoms except such as may be derived from their general Treaties and Agreements or from the agreements obtained from them in respect of foreign aircraft in 1946 (paragraph 128 above). id) Slavery (i) The Slave Traffic 137. The importation of slaves from Africa had ceased before the period under review, but before and during the last was a substantial number of persons were exported from the coast of Persian Baluchistan and, to a lesser extent it is believed, from the coast of what was then British Baluchistan mostly to the f 126 ) P.R. to P.O.

It is known that Fujairah was concerned in this traffic and it is probable that abductions also took place from the Trucial Coast towns, but as in those days the Government of India refrained from interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial States they did not come to notice. It is also believed that from time to time slaves have been sent by sea from the Trucial Coast to Qatar or Kuwait for sale in Saudi Arabia and two such cases in which Dubai was concerned, have come to notice since the last war (paragraph 20 above). Before the period under review, Dubai was reported as playing a prominent part in the slave traffic( 129 ) and it is probable that certain members of its ruling family and its mercantile community are still the principal agents through whom slave-dealers in Hamasah and Saudi Arabia obtain their goods. 138. After the last war a regular traffic in slaves between the Trucial Coast towns and Hamasah developed and a detailed report on the subject was submitted by the Political Resident at the beginning of 1949.( 150 ) This showed that in 1947 and 1948 reports had been received of 48 persons, mostly women and children, being sold into slavery, all except two of whom had been forcibly kidnapped. It should be noted here that although by their treaties the Rulers are only bound to stop the traffic in slaves by sea, none of them has ever denied his responsibility lor stopping it also by land. The Political Resident discussed the ways and means ot bringing political and economic pressure to bear upon the Rulers to enforce this responsibility and enquired whether resort could be had to naval bombardment when^ircuinstances appeared to justify this.C') He had previously recommended the bombardment of Hirah on account of the complicity of its Shaikh in an abduction and called attention to the fact that sanction had been received to bombardment of Abu Dhabi in similar circumstances in 1938. His enquiry led to much inter-departmental discussion and no definite reply appears to have been 'it but it was decided that naval bombardment was no longer practicable (ii) Domestic Slavery ir. iQS?r 13 ^ 139.

All the Rulers except Abu Dhabi and Fujairah have given an undertaking not to enter into negotiations with a bank for the opening ol a branch in their States without the approval of Her Majesty's Government (paragraph 73 above). 143., On January 5, 1946 the Imperial Bank of Iran (now the British Bank of the Middle East) entered into an agreement (Appendix L) with the Ruler of Dubai for the opening of a branch at that place. The agreement gives the Bank a monopoly for 20 years. The branch was opened in October 1946. 144. On February 5, 1953 the same Bank entered into an agreement (Appendix M (i)) with the Ruler of Sharjah for the opening of a branch at that place. The agreement was for 20 years but was not exclusive. By a subsidiary agreement (Appendix M (ii)) it was agreed that the branch would be opened for only two days a week, the Bank having the discretion to open it for six days a week should the volume of the work in the future justify this. The branch was opened in March 1953. The Ruler did not solicit approval before entering into negotiations with the Bank but was subsequently reminded of his obligation.( J i I ) WatberJ 145. In November 1953 the British Bank of the Middle East signed an agreement with the Ruler of Abu Dhabi. It is on the same lines as the Bank's agreement with Dubai (paragraph 143 above) with the exception of the following two provisions: — ' Article 12. It is agreed that the Bank will open a branch in Abu Dhabi territory within six months of the oil company which holds the concession (whether land or sea) confirming in writing to the Ruler that they have started the commercial exploitation of oil discovered in his territory.' ' Article 13 {b). If at any time the parties to this agreement are unable to settle between themselves any dispute that may arise it is agreed that they should request the Political Agent to arbitrate or to appoint an arbitrator, and the decision of the Political Agent or his appointee shall be accepted as final and binding on both parties.' (/) Post Office 146. The Government of India opened a post office in Dubai in 1941. On partition in 1947 it was taken over by the Pakistani authorities who handed it over to the General Post Office on April 1, 1948. British stamps are now used surcharged with rupee values only. (g) Telecommunications 147. In 1933, as a result ol arrangements made between Imperial and International Communications (later Cable and Wireless) Ltd and the Air Ministry, Imperial Airways made the Wireless Telegraph Station which they had established at Sharjah for civil aviation purposes (paragraph 122 above) available for the use of the general public.( 135 ) The Ruler, who had not been consulted, objected and it was not until 1937 that he informed the Political Agent Bahrain that he had tacitly admitted the principle of a public wireless station as he saw that it was of benefit to his subjects.( 130 ) Imperial Airways and their successors the British Overseas Airways Corporation continued to administer the Telesraoh Station until 1948. In 1947 Cable and Wireless on the assumption thai the Corporation would shortly be withdrawing from Sharjah put forward a proposal for seeking a concession there,( 137 ) but when the Corporation withdrew International Aeradio Ltd. took over the Station which thev still continue to administer Under the Civil Air Agreement of 1951 His Majesty's Government obtained the right to operate a wireless station directly or through representatives on their own behalf or behalf of others and to levy charges At the same time the Ruler was informed m writing (Appendix N) that he could send telegrams free of charge up to a limit of 2,000 words a year through the telegraph station. 148. In 1950 International Aeradio wished to open a telearanh office at Dubai but it was held that this was in the sphere of influence of Cabfe and Wireless. The latter accordingly entered into negotiations with the Ruler of Dubai and in 1951 obtained from him a concession (Appendix O) for 20 years. It covered both the establishment of a telegraph station and the installation of a telephone service ,rw, U) (■') P.R. to F.O. 1115/1/10/53 of March 11, 1953 (EA 1115/5 of 19531 I ifhi 0 ' O I.O.toF.O.

[n 1939 the Government of India opened a dispensary at Dubai and provided the services of an Indian Sub-Assistant Surgeon, the expenditure involved being shared with His Majesty's Government. 150. In 1941 His Majesty's Government and the Government of India agreed to contribute jointly a sum of Rs. 5,000/- towards the cost of a hospital leaving a balance of Rs. 8,000/- to be raised by local subscriptions^ 138 ) Unfortunately no action was taken at the time but during and after the war a fund was raised for the hospital from local contributions and from profits on the sale of cereals and the local commodities. After Her Majesty's Government took over responsibility for the Persian Gulf Residency all expenditure on the dispensary was debited to this fund. 151. In 1949 the services of a British doctor were obtained and paid for from the fund, His Majesty's Government only contributing £45 a year for attendance on the Agency staff at Sharjah. A hospital was then built at a cost of about £28,125 and was formally opened by the Ruler in 1951 and called the A1 Maktum Hospital after his father.( 139 ) Most of the fund was used on the building and equipment of the hospital and some difficulty has been experienced subsequently in obtaining the money required for its maintenance and the pay of the British doctor and his staff. At the end of 1952 the annual expenditure was estimated at Rs. 75,000 towards which the Ruler of Dubai was contributing Rs. 40,000 and about Rs. 10,000 was obtained from fees.( li0 ) Regular contributions on a much smaller scale have been promised by the other Rulers and Her Majesty's Government made a grant of £2 000 for expenditure on capital equipment in the financial year 1953-54. I he hospital is managed by a Committee of which the Rulers are members. 152. In 1953 a representative of the Red Cross Society visited the Trucial Coast and the Society subsequently undertook to equip and despatch a mobile dispensary to work there for one year, in the hope that it would be possible for a local branch of the Society to be formed to take it over after that The Pohtica Resident has reported that there is httle possibility of such an eventuality.t 153 The quarantine service on the Trucial Coast is administered by the formalities. Vaccination is earned out amongst the local population on as w oe a scale as possible. (0 Nationality Law and Travel Documents 154.

The India Office prepared a note entitled ' Red Oxide on Abu Musa 1898-1934' which was communicated to the Foreign Office in 1934.( ) It contains the history of two concessions granted by the Ruler of Sharjah prior to 1934, from which little benefit appears to have been derived. 157. In 1935 the Ruler granted a concession to Commander Bayldon to mine red oxide on the islands of Bu Musa and Sir Bu Nair on payment ot Rs. 6,000/- down and Rs. 2/- per ton royalty. The agreement (Appendix P (i)) was to remain in force for 21 years subject to the payment of royalty of not less than Rs. 2,000/- a year. The concession was worked by a company entitled the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company Ltd. (later known as Golden Valley Colours Ltd.). The grant of the Concession evoked strong protests from the Persian Government who claim the ownership of Bu Musa. It was accompanied by a supplementary agreement (Appendix P (ii)) covering a few points which had not been included in the main agreement. 158. The company worked the concession on the two islands until 1953 with an interruption of several years during the war and exported substantial quantities of red oxide. In 1953 having obtained a concession for some of the Abu Dhabi islands they discontinued operations on Bu Musa and Sir Bu Nair to the great annoyance of the Ruler of Sharjah. They have not given him notice of the abandonment of their concessions. He has brought a number of complaints against them in respect of matters relating to the concession and to a separate concession for the quarrying of stone on Bu Musa which they obtained from him. 159. In 1952 the company obtained a concession for the Tamb Islands from the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah on payment of Rs. 9,000/- down with a royalty of Rs. 4/- per ton subject to a minimum annual payment of Rs. 2,000/-. The concession was abandoned in the following year, apparently because the deposits of ore in the islands were considered not worth working, without any formal notice being given to the Ruler. 160. In 1953 the company obtained a concession from the Ruler of Abu Dhabi ' for all the territory owned or controlled by him,' but he specified eight islands (not including Halul) in which they might operated 145 ) The concession stipulates for the payment of a rental of Rs. 25,000 a year and royalty at Rs. 10/- per ton with a minimum of Rs. 40,000 a year conditional upon sufficient labour being available. The company is permitted to cancel the concession if it is of the opinion that there is not sufficient red oxide available to permit the extraction of 4,000 tons a year.( 146 ) {k) Anti-Locust Measures 161. Trucial Oman and the country to the south of it are regarded as a danger spot from the point of view of locust-breeding. The Pakistan Government sent an anti-locust team to the Trucial Coast in 1949 and at the end of that year the Desert Locust Survey took over responsibility for dealing with the area. Since then they have had one or more officers regularly stationed at Sharjah. Their parties have visited most of Trucial Oman and before the arrival of Turki at Hamasah penetrated south of Buraimi. In 1950 two of their officers were looted by the Shihuh in Ras al Khaimah territory but most of the property was recovered by the Ruler. Otherwise they have not been involved in any incident. They have, however, encountered much opposition from the tribesmen to the use of poison-bait for the destruction of hoppers owing to the belief that the bait is also injurious to animals. This matter has been taken up with the Trucial States Council, and it is believed that the prejudices of the tribesmen have now been overcome. Except at Buraimi locusts can do little damage in the Trucial States owing to the absence of cultivation and they are welcomed by the population as an addition to their food supply. The object of the Desert Locust Survey is to locate the breeding-grounds and destroy the hoppers in order to prevent swarms developing which will do damage elsewhere. ( 144 ) I.O. to P.O.

( ,46 ) The Company abandoned the concession early in 1954.171 CHAPTER 6 MUSCAT I.—General 1. His Highness Saiyid Sa'id bin Taimur bin Faisal, born in 1910, succeeded officially as Sultan of Muscat and Oman and Dependencies in February 1932 on the abdication of his father Saiyid Taimur. The Dependencies referred to in the territorial designation are Gwadur and Dhofar which are not part of Oman. The title ' Highness ' is used in conversation and personal correspondence conducted in English but the Sultan will not permit it to be used in official documents^ 1 ) Although most of his subjects give him no title other than Saiyid, it is probable that he would like to be addressed as ' Majesty.' The Foreign Office have held that he must himself formally adopt this style, which he has never done, and that it is not for Her Majesty's Government to take the initiative^ 2 ) He is entitled to a salute of 21 guns. He was awarded the K.C.LE. in 1938 and the G.C.LE. in 1945. He protested when the last award was made because the British Broadcasting Corporation included it amongst the honours granted to Indian Princes. In accordance with a request which he made when he received the K.C.I.E. no honour is written after his name either in private or official correspondence.^) His attitude in this and many other matters is no doubt due to his jealousy of his independence and his fear of being regarded as possessing the same status as the Ruler of an Indian State or a Gulf shaikhdom, which was in fact the treatment in practice accorded to his predecessors by the late British Government of India. He has one son Saiyid Qabus who was born in December 1940, and up to 1953 had lived the whole of his life in Dhofar. The Sultan paid an official visit to India in 1932 and again in 1937 when he stayed with the Viceroy and to England in 1938 where he was the guest of His Majesty's Government ior a fortnight and was received in audience by The King. He also visited England privately in 1953 and was received in audience by The Queen. He spends almost half his time away from his capital and keeps his family in Dhofar, where he often resides tor long periods. Before 1947 he also paid many visits of considerable duration to India. He was educated in India and Iraq and has a faiily good knowledge o English. He is a very astute Ruler, but is diffident and lacks force of charac er. He endeavours to make up for these deficiencies by adopting an a 1 ^ e o rega aloofness which does not make him popular with his fellow-Arabs^ He has three brothers. The eldest Saiyid Majid m 1953 was Wall ^ Sun Thyecond Saijnd Tarin was born in Turkev of a Turkish mother and educated in Turkey ana BE Bits rsM M° n niS .Sr after which he served for a time with ; ^ ^ t f t A1 Saeed It should Taimur is living at Bombay under , ^ e ' t Saivid Sa 'id who died in 1856 were all be noted that the f^enysons ofdieg y ^ slave . blood in their veins . by concubines and that the Muscat ru g Arabs will n The ruling families of the Gu f Sta.khdoms therefore, give their daughters m mar . g • j ^nfpntate who has commercial treaties with 2. The Sultan is an mdependent ^ (1953)(4) as the Government of the United States ( , , j j addition a commercial well as with Her Majesty's Government.^ There is in ^ Ang | 0 .French declaration of 1877 with the Netherlands h French Government declaration of 1862, Her Majesty s Government ana172 engage reciprocally to respect Muscat's independence.( li ) Under his treaty relations with Her Majesty's Government the Sultan is pledged never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation, save to Her Majesty's Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman or any of their dependencies,! 7 ) and the right to search Muscat vessels for slaves or arms has been ceded to Her Majesty's Government (paragraph 97 below).( 8 ) While the Sultan is in theory a wholly independent ruler, since the end of the eighteenth century British influence has been predominant in Muscat and the relations which obtain between its ruler and Her Majesty's Government approximate to those which obtain between Her Majesty's Government and the Gulf Shaikhdoms. As already indicated, however, Saiyid Sa'id is extremely jealous of his independence and while he will always turn to Her Majesty's Government for advice and assistance when he is in difficulties, on other occasions he is showing an increasing tendency to take a line of his own. Generally speaking, the more his facade of independence is respected the more willing he is to consult Her Majesty's Representatives or at least to keep them informed about his own country's affairs and his dealings with other powers. 3. The Sultan keeps all affairs under his close personal control. He has an Arab Minister of Internal Affairs and a British Minister for Foreign Affairs, who are left in control at Muscat during his absences but are given no authority to make decisions in any except very petty matters without consulting him. On such occasions he is usually represented for ceremonial purposes by his uncle Saiyid Shahab who is entitled to a salute of 13 guns when acting for his nephew. The Sultan is his own Finance Minister but has recently re-employed a Pakistani called Maqbul Hussain, who previously served as his Director of Customs and prior to that as Treasury Officer in the Muscat Political Agency, to assist in his financial matters. The Director of Customs is now Iskandar Hanna, an Egyptian Copt. In the towns and larger villages there are Walis or local governors who work under the orders of the Minister of Internal Affairs. When the British Minister for Foreign Affairs was first appointed the Sultan made him responsible generally for dealings with Her Majesty's Consulate but continued to transact important business himself direct with Her Majesty's Consul-General. At Gwadur besides the Wali who represents the Sultan there is a British Administrator who deals mainly with municipal matters under the supervision of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 4. Until the Commercial Treaty ol 19510 was signed the representative of Her Majesty's Government (and until 1947 of the Government of India) at Muscat was designated Political Agent, though since 1867 he was also held Her Majesty's Commission as Consul and for many years has always been referred to by the Sultan and the Omani tribesmen as such. At the time of the signing of the Treaty an informal agreement was reached with the Sultan that the designation ' Political Agent should be dropped.( ) Her Majesty's representative is now a Consul with the personal rank and salute of Consul-General. He is assisted by a Vice-Consul who in the absences of his superior officer, is only entitled to act' as Consul No exequaturs are issued by the Sultan but under the 1951 Treaty his formal consent and approval has to be obtained before a Consul or Vice-Consul is appointed At Gwadur an Indian or Pakistani is usually appointed by the Political Resident to hold charge of British interests. Until 1952 he was designated' but has now been made a Pro-Consul and is designated' as such There is no obligation to consult the Sultan before such an appointment is made. 5 During the twenty-five years under review Her Majesty's Government have maintained in Muscat a predominating influence which is not at present threatened by any other power. In recent years there has been some increase of American influence, but it has not been used to weaken Her Majesty's Government's nositinn The present Sultan, however, since his accession whilst retamin^ h ™dendsto S Her Majesty's Government and consulting them when in difficulties has teen extremely jealous of his independence and~has shown an increasing tendency to Majesty^; Government. 676 ' ^ matterS 0f SOme im P orta ' ce with ^ informing Her ( 6 ) No. 3 V, T.C.

Muscat is at present of no commercial and of little strategic value to them. Should, however, oil be found at a place m the Sultan s territories whence it could be piped to the coast of the Indian Ucean the position in this respect would be completely changed. As things are the most thcit can be said is that any abandonment by Her Majesty's oovernment ol their long-standing friendship with Muscat would be a break in tradition that could not fail to have a disturbing effect on their relations with the Persian Gulf Rulers generally. . 7* ^ instructions issued in 1953 to the new incumbent of the post of Political Resioent the objectives ot Her Majesty's Government in Muscat are defined as follows: — (i) to retain as iar as possible the relationship based on existing agreements between the United Kingdom and the Sultan of Muscat and to harmonise the Sultan's internal and external policies with the interests of Her Majesty's Government; (ii) to retain the facilities in the Sultanate at present granted to Her Majesty's forces; (hi) to secure recognition of the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate as near as possible to the line defined by the Sultan in 1937; (iv) to enable Petroleum Development (Oman) (Limited) to take full advantage (at the earliest moment) of their concession, which in Her Majesty's Government's view covers the Sultan's territory up to the line defined at (hi) above. With reference to (iv) the hope is expressed that the Sultan will be able to extend his authority peacefully and effectively over Central Oman and that Saudi influence will be excluded from that area, and it is stated that Her Majesty's Government are ready to assist the Sultan in this task but wish, if possible, to avoid direct involvement.( 11 ) II.—Internal Affairs 8. The main problem at the beginning of this period was the absenteeism of the Sultan, Saiyid Taimur, and his desire to abdicate. From the beginning of 1928 until his abdication at the end of 1931 he only spent between eight and nine months in Muscat. He disliked the place and probably resented the close control exercised over his affairs by the Government of India and its officers. He spent much of his time in India, but also visited Europe, the United States of America and Japan. In 1928 he visited the United Kingdom where he spent a month as the guest of The King, by whom he was received in audience, and underwent an operation for appendicitis. In March 1930 he sailed for India and informed the Political Resident that he did not intend to return. The Political Resident or Political Agent, Muscat, interviewed him on several occasions in India but failed to shake his resolve. After a final interview with him in November 1931 the Political Resident wrote to him saying that if he abdicated it would be necessary to reduce his monthly personal allowance from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 2,000, and that the arms subsidy of Rs. 1,00,000 which was personal to him would cease to be payable, and appealing to him to reconsider his decision.( 12 ) He replied that owing to his ailments he must persist in his refusal to return to Muscat, that he accepted his reduced allowance and that the Government of India could do what they wished about the arms subsidy. He accordingly announced his abdication from the date of the letter (November 13, 1931) and appointed his son Sa'id as his successor. In the circumstances it became necessary to accept the situation and proceed with the recognition of Sa'id as Sultan. 9. Sa'id had returned to Muscat from his school in Iraq in 1928, and had at once started training in administrative work. In 1929 he had been appointed President of the Council of Ministers, and in view of his father's prolonged absences quicklv became the virtual ruler of the country. He was Taimur's eldest son, had reached the age of 21, and had already shown promise of considerable ability. R LatoRa pS'/M ofoeSn. mUE 6230/267/91 of 1931).The Government of India appear to have been under the erroneous impression that some form of election was necessary, but once this had been removed there was no hesitation in accepting him. The Political Resident wrote to him on January 9, 1932, informing him that His Majesty's Government and the Govern ment of India recognised him officially as Sultan of Muscat and Oman, but owing to the incidence of Ramadhan he did not publicly announce his accession until February 10. At the beginning of March the Political Resident held a formal Durbar at Muscat during which he delivered to the new Sultan a ' Kharita ' from the Viceroy conveying congratulations and good wishes, to which^ the Sultan later sent a suitable repy. During the ceremony three of His Majesty's ships and two Royal Air Force flying-boats were present in the harbour. The shore battery fired a salute of thirty-one guns in honour of the Viceroy and the ships replied with a salute of twenty-one guns for the Sultan. A naval guard of honour was provided at the palace and the ships were dressed throughout the day. ( 13 ) 10. The French had been given prior intimation of the intention to recognise Sa'id, and subsequently at his request all the other Powers with whom he was in treaty relations, viz., the United States of America, France and the Netherlands, were officially informed of his accession by His Majesty's Government acting on his behalf. 11. Sa'id had apparently been required as a condition of his recognition to give an undertaking similar to that given by his father,( 14 ) though it is not clear how this requirement was conveyed to him. He accordingly wrote to the Political Resident on February 10, 1932, asking him to assure His Majesty's Government that he had accepted all the obligations to the High Government descending to him from his father, that he was determined to follow his father's policy in all his relations with Government, and that he relied on the help of the Government and declaring that in accordance with the wishes of his father he would be guided by His Majesty's Government's views in important matters (Appendix A). In 1938 and again in 1953 he stated with special reference to his father's promise not to grant permission for the exploitation of oil without consulting the British authoritiesC 5 ) that he did not consider himself bound by any undertakings given by his predecessors in which it was not expressly stated that they were binding upon successors.( 16 ) From what he said on both occasions it appears that he based his contention on a letter written by his father to the Political Agent, Muscat, in 1923 to the effect that if the arms subsidy was to be treated as personal to himself, any engagements made by him in which no mention was made of his successors were not binding on these successors.( 17 ) In 1953 the Foreign Office informed the Political Resident that although they felt that they could not insist that the Sultan was under a legal obligation to consult the British authorities before granting an oil concession, they desired that when a suitable opportunity occurred his attention should be drawn to the manner in which they believed the letter he wrote upon his accession was intended to be interpreted and that he should be reminded of his declaration that he would follow the policy of his father and consult Her Majesty's Government on all important matters, oil being such a matter.C 8 ) 12. Sa'id's first act after his accession was to abolish the Council of Ministers which his father had been induced by His Majesty's Government to create in return for assistance in the reconstruction of his finances. Sa'id has ever since ruled personally with the assistance of two or three Ministers to whom he delegates little authority. In reporting the abolition of the Council of Ministers the Political Resident called attention to the fact that Sa'id had a better education and wider outlook than any of his predecessors and recommended that ' he should be given every chance to administer his State on Arab lines, and every effort should be made to free him from those relics of the past which are galling to him, while he should try, at the same time, to build up a facade of independence in the eyes of the world.'( 19 ) This policy which was accepted by the Government of India( 20 ) has ( 13 ) I.O. to F.O.

At the same time he has remained consistently friendly to Her Majesty's Government, no doubt realising the extent to which he is dependent on their support. Her Majesty s Government now make no attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Muscat beyond from time to time encouraging the Sultan to develop his local resources and they only act on his behalf in external affairs when requested by him to do so. At the same time they are the only power represented in Muscat and undoubtedly continue to exercise a strong if not predominating influence there, while the outside world including the Omani tribes almost certainly credit them with more influence than they in fact possess. 13. The State finances were in a parlous condition when Sa'id took over and in 1931 the budget was reported to show a deficit of about £10,000 while a portion of the loan of £48,750 received from the Government of India in 1918 and 1920 remained to be re-paid. Sultan Sa'id with the assistance of British advisers for a year or two and later by his own unaided efforts quickly restored financial stability. The loan to the Government of India and other debts were paid off and in 1950 it was reported that the State revenues amounted to £225,000, that the expenditure was about half this and that there was a reserve of about £1,000,000. The Sultan was assisted in this by an increase in tariffs which was agreed to by His Majesty's Government in 1933 and by the great increase of the value of imports and exports which took place during the Second World War. Since the last British Financial Adviser left in 1933 he has been his own Finance Minister and has shown ability in this capacity though he has a tendency to err on the side of parsimony. Not only is his personal expenditure modest, but he fails to exercise the generosity which is necessary to win the affection of his tribes and he is hesitant about spending money on beneficent works such as schools and hospitals and on development schemes. At one time he used to send particulars of the Muscat State budget to the Political Agent but ceased to do so in 1948. He has never been willing to give any information about the income and expenditure in the Dhofar Province, which he treats as his private estate. Although the State is now solvent it still has a very small income compared with that of the oil-producing Shaikhdoms and there is unlikely to be any great improvement unless oil is discovered. It is believed that the Sultan has a fairly substantial fortune of his own set aside in addition to his State reserve. Most of the latter is not invested but is kept in the State Treasury. 14. In 1928 Mr. Bertram Thomas still held the post of Financial Adviser. He retained the appointment until 1930 when he was succeeded by Mr. Hedgcock. The latter came into conflict with the political authorities and resigned after about six months of office. Arrangements were then made for Captain Alban the Commandant of the Muscat Infantry to perform the functions of Financial Adviser in addition to his ordinary duties. When he left Muscat in 1933 nobody was found to succeed him as Financial Adviser and early in 1934 the Sultan abolished the post. He however made specific requests for the services of a British Adviser in 1937, in 1938 in an interview with the Viceroy and again in 1945. In the later year the Government of India sent him an Indian to interview for the appointment but he refused to accept him and reiterated his request for a British Adviser. When at length in 1949 a British Adviser was found for him in the person of Lt.-Col. B. Woods Ballard, C.I.E., M.B.E., he made him Minister of Foreign Affairs and not of Finance. It is probable that by this time he had decided that he preferred to keep the State's finances as a closely guarded secret under his own control. In 1953 Woods Ballard resigned on the termination of his contract and was replaced by Mr. N. Mc'L. Innes. 15. The bulk of the Muscat revenues is derived from customs duties. Under Article 6 of the Commercial Treaty of 1891( 21 ) the amount of import duty was limited to 5 per cent, ad valorem. In 1930 Taimur, in order to increase his revenues, applied for the removal of this limitation. His Majesty's Government were ready to aeree but considered it necessary first to obtain the consent of France, the United States of America and the Netherlands. Under the treaties between Muscat and the first two of these countries a similar limitation exists while the Netherlands are entitled to most -favoured-nation treatment.(') Sa'id after his accession suggested the denunciation of these treaties but it was agreed that although such i 21 ) XVI at p. 310, Aitchison, Vol. XI. ( 22 ) Nos. 1, 2 and 3 VI, T.C. 46639 M 2 A176 denunciation would be possible it was not desirable both because it would be attributed to the influence of His Majesty's Government and for other reasons.C) As a result of prolonged negotiations the French agreed to the increase of customs duties to 25 per cent, on tobacco and liquor of a specified strength and 10 per cent, on other goods. The Americans demanded most-favoured-nation treatment not only for their goods but for their nationals, a condition which the Sultan was unwilling to accept, and in these circumstances no approach was made to the Dutch. In 1933 the Sultan was formally notified of the concurrence of His Majesty's Government and the Government of the French Republic in the increases stated above on the understanding {a) that a similar increase would apply to ships of all other nations except those of the United States and the Netherlands and {h) that if any ships of these two countries exploited their Treaty advantage to the detriment of British or French trade the right of withdrawing their acquiescence in the increase of duties was reserved to the Governments concerned.( 24 ) Similar notes were addressed to him on behalf of the Governments of the Irish Free State and Canada. 16. The State's finances have also been supported by subsidies from Her Majesty's Government and the Government of India. The Zanzibar subsidy of Rs. 86,400 (£6,480) a year('') is payable in perpetuity to the lawful Sultan of Muscat provided he ' continues faithfully to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifest his friendship towards the British Government.'( 26 ) It was' accordingly held in 1938 that it was not feasible to use a threat to terminate the subsidy as a lever for insisting on the Sultan's consulting His Majesty's Government in the matter of his relations with foreign powers. The subsidy was previously paid bv the Government of India but His Majesty's Government accepted responsibility for it irom April 1, 1947, when they took over charge of the Persian Gulf posts. At the same time the Sultan asked that payments should be made to him in Muscat instead ot Bombay. Sa'id after his accession was informed that the Zanzibar subsidy would be continued to him on the conditions stated and that the arms traffic subsidy^ ), although it was personal to the late Sultan, would be contmued for three years in order to prevent the financial collapse of the State ( 28 ) When the three years expired the Political Resident recommended that it should be contmued until the end of 1935 on condition that the money would be snent on social services, such as sanitation and the building of a school and this recommendation was accepted. The subsidy was discontinued with effect from January 1, 1936, but the Sultan did not accept the situation and when he saw the Viceroy m Delhi 1937 he pressed for its renewal. The Government of India evaded the issue for as long as possible but in 1939 the Sultan threatened to abdicate if he were not given financial assistance and immediately after the outbreak of the war the Viceroy wrote to him apologising for the delay in replying to his request and promising its sympathetic consideration. As, however a war subsidv of £ 8 0°° a year was shortly after this granted to him the quekion of tte r newa of the arms subsidy was dropped. After the war it was agreed that it shoidd hp left to the Sultan to raise it again but he apparently never^did so ( 2 ') Under the Civil Air Agreement of 1934 (paragraph 91 below) a payment of £500 a vear was granted to the Sultan for the lease of the aerodromes and for the nriviWes enumerated in the agreement and was paid with retrospective effect from June 929 The amount was subsequently raised to £1,000 a year with effect from Tm Vrv i 1935. The agreement expired in 1938 and was not renewefand pre^umablv fte annual payment under it ceased.

He was given liberty of action in respect of taxes and tariffs provided British subjects and goods were given most-favoured nation treatment, and it was agreed that the British Consular authorities would at his request apply to British subjects his laws and regulations imposing taxation and duties, and police and municipal regulations, but apart from this the extra territorial jurisdiction conferred by the 1891 Treaty was only very slightly curtailed. The Sultan's desire that all privileges granted to Great Britain by the Treaty should be reciprocal was met so far as was practicable. This Treaty was to remain in force for twelve years after which it was automatically to remain in force unless notice of termination was given by one of the parties. The Sultan gave such notice as soon as he was in a position to do so in February 1950, but as negotiations for a new Treaty were prolonged the old one was with the consent of the parties extended up to December 31, 1951. The new Treaty was signed on December 20, 1951, and came into force on January 1, 1952, and is to remain in force for fifteen years after which it will automatically continue in force unless notice of termination is given by one of the parties.C 0 ) In asking for the termination of the previous Treaty the Sultan was probably actuated by a desire to exclude India, in view of the changed conditions there, and to abolish the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the British Consular authorities which he regarded as an infringement of his sovereignty. India and Pakistan are not parties to the Treaty. They were consulted on the subject and preferred to make their own arrangements. The Sultan was persuaded to agree to the retention of a limited amount of extra-territorial jurisdiction but this is covered by an exchange of letters and no mention of it is made in the Treaty. In other respects the new Treaty differs little from its predecessor. 18. Sa'id while he has met with little success in extending his influence over the tribes of the interior has made considerable progress in the consolidation of his control over the coastal areas. In 1931 before his accession he visited Sohar on the Batinah coast in a State gunboat and deposed the Wali, his uncle Saiyid Hamad, who was showing too much independence. In 1928 Shaikh Ali of the Bani Bu Ali at Sur was asserting his independence of Muscat and styling himself Amir of Jaalan.( 31 ) It is interesting to note that in September of that year Ali hoisted Ibn Saud's flag and in 1929 he visited that monarch and subsequently handed to the Resident at Aden a letter addressed to the Political Resident in which he virtually demanded independent recognition. In October 1928 a Muscat gunboat escorted by one of His Majesty's ships ineffectually bombarded a block-house at Sur and later in the year one of His Majesty's ships bombarded the same block house without achieving any result. In 1932 a combined operation by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force compelled Ali to yield and a customs port was established under the Muscat flag in his part of the town. He continued, however, to adopt a defiant attitude, and it was not until 1938 that he visited Muscat and made his formal submission to the Sultan. In 1930 the Shaikh of Khassab in the Musandam peninsula refused to admit some naval survey parties and defied the Sultan's authority. The place was bombarded by two of His Majesty's ships in company with the State gunboat and the Shaikh surrendered. Since 1932 British forces have never been called upon to support the Sultan's authority in any of the territory which he administers. The position in 1953 was as follows. The Shihuh in the Musandam peninsula were giving little trouble though it is doubtful whether the Sultan's Wali at Khassab exercised full control over them. The whole of the coast of the Gulf of Oman from the Muscat-Sharjah boundary in the north to Rus al Hadd in the south is under the Sultan's effective control. The southern coast of Arabia from Ras al Hadd to the western boundary of Dhofar is very sparsely inhabited by the Janabah, and although the Sultan had no organised administration there he appeared to have acquired sufficient influence over the tribe to contemplate constructing a road through their territory to Dhofar. Over the latter province he had completely established his authority at any rate up to the northern base of the hills and according to his own account up to and including the Mughsin oasis, where he had established a post. 19 At the outbreak of war in 1939 the Sultan promised His Majesty's Government all assistance in his power. Shortly afterwards he prohibited all trading with Germany, and he and his subjects contributed generously to war funds. ( 30 ) No. 11 V, T.C. ( 3] ) Para. 42 at p. 51, P.G. 13. 46639 2 A 2 /178 In return for the grant of facilities for His Majesty's Forces His Majesty's Govern ment promised to protect his territories against external aggression and to give such assistance as might be possible in the event of internal disturbances. They also agreed that {a) he should be a party to any peace treaty alfecting his territory {b) the facilities granted should terminate at the end of the War (c) his permission should be obtained before any attempt was made to enter into direct relations with the Omani leaders {d) Muscat would be kept supplied with foodstuffs {e) he would be granted a subsidy of £1,500 a month plus a grant of £3,750 for the repair of fortifications and (/) he would be supplied free with certain arms and equipment for which he had asked.( i2 ) The Sultan granted the Royal Air Force all the facilities they required at the airfields on the southern coast of Arabia and later these facilities were extended to the United States Forces, and he allowed the Royal Navy to make such use as they wished of Khor Quwai. He also raised the strength of the Muscat Infantry from 200 to 350. The war subsidy was continued until January 1, 1947, from which date the annual subsidy of £6,000 under the Civil Air Agreement oi that year became payable. Except for the blowing-up of the steamer Dahpu, it is believed by a Japanese torpedo, in Muscat harbour in 1943, Muscat saw nothing of the war though the rise in prices and the shortage of rice caused a good deal of distress and some agitation by the tribes of the interior. 20. Apart Irom a handful of police at Muscat and Matrah the only trained lorce which until recently the Sultan has had at his disposal is the Muscat Infantry which has an ordinary peacetime strength of about 200 under a British officer. This was raised in 1921 and was previously known as the Muscat Levy Corps.( 33 ) It has its headquarters at Bait al Falaj about four miles from Muscat. Its role is to defend Muscat and Matrah in the event of tribal attack and it is not ordinarily used for any purpose outside this area. It supplies guards for the Sultan's palace and for Her Majesty's Consulate in Muscat. It is well-armed and well-trained, but it has never been put to the test. It is recruited mainly from Buluchis and Arabs ol the coastal area, and though this material is not of the best its superior armament should enable it to withstand a tribal attack. A number of recruits used to be obtained from Mekran in what was once British Buluchistan and is now part of Pakistan. As a result, however, of a mutiny which took place in 1950 all the Mekranis were discharged and recruiting is now confined to Muscat territory. Increases of pay have not kept pace with the rise in the cost of living and a good standard of recruit is difficult to obtain. Prior to 1947 British officers were seconded from the Indian Army to command the force together with two or three Viceroy s Commissioned Officers to assist them in its training. Since that year it has so far been possible to obtain British officers with Indian Army experience, but this source is now drying up, and difficulty is likely to be experienced in future in finding suitable Commandants, the more so as all training is carried out in Urdu and the Sultan has hitherto resisted a suggestion that Arabic should be used instead. Officers of the Viceroy s Commissioned Officer type are still being obtained for the force through the good offices of the Government of Pakistan. The Sultan has also resisted a suggestion that the Muscat Infantry and his new force in the Batinah should be assimilated and placed under one command The latter force, known as the Batinah Force, was established by the Sultan in 1952 with its headquarters at Sohar. The services of two British officers with a knowledge of Arabic have been obtained for it and it has been recruited up to a strength of 80 Its role has not yet been defined but it is believed that it is designed to strengthen the Sultan's administration in the Batinah and in particular to prevent raiding by nomad tribes from the north and to facilitate the collection of customs on aoods arriving by land. It is also believed that the Sultan hopes that in due course he may be able to use it for extending his authority inland. Apart from these two forces the Sultan and his Wahs rely on armed, but untrained retainers to enforce their authority. In 1953 the raising of a force to cover contemplated operations by the oil company on the southern coast of Arabia (paragraph 62 below) was taken in hand. 21. The first Government school in Muscat was opened in 1928. It was transferred to a new building in 1940. Only primary education is imparted and the greatest difficulty is experienced in finding qualified teachers as there are few Muscatis suitable and available for employment and the Palestinians whose S t » 0 ' t0 J ?- £i Z pr 7l ?( 39 0f September 19 ' 1939 (E 6548/37/91 of 1939).

The Sultan also has a school at Salalah about which little is known and a well-attended but miserably housed primary school at Gwadur. A few Muscatis were once sent to Bahrain for education, but the experiment was not a success and the Sultan has recently been considering a proposal to send some of his subjects for secondary education to Aden. The Mission of the Dutch Reformed Church of America used to have schools in Muscat and Matrah, but these cater only for children of their own staff as in 1947 the Sultan to afford proof of his orthodoxy forbade others to attend them. The Hindu and Khojah communities also have their own schools. 22. In 1932 the Sultan formed a Municipal Committee consisting of six Muscat and three British subjects for the towns of Muscat and Matrah. A King's Regulation had already been issued in 1935 making applicable to British subjects rules and taxes imposed by the Muscat Government on their own subjects for the conservancy of these two towns subject to their approval by the Political Resident.(') By virtue of the Commercial Treaty of 1939 this Regulation became a dead letter. In 1938 to provide funds for the Municipality a tax of one anna per package was imposed on goods liable to customs duty imported from abroad and was made applicable to British subjects. In 1948 the Sultans brother, Saiyid Tariq was made Administrator of the Municipality, and when Lieutenant-Colonel Woods Ballard took over as Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1.949 he was made the ' High Authority ' responsible for its supervision. In 1952 a Sultanate Municipal Law, based on the law regulating the municipality at Quetta in Baluchistan when it was under British rule, was issued and applied to Muscat, Matrah and Gwadur. The Municipal Committee for Muscat and Matrah has greatly improved conditions in those towns but there is room for much further improvement. The Consulate Medical Officer has been appointed ex officio Municipal Health Officer and has assisted in anti-malarial work and sanitary measures generally. 23 All cases in the Muscat Courts are decided in accordance with Muhammadan (Shara) law. Appeals are referred to the Sultan who if he considers it necessary appoints special tribunals to hear them. Prisoners are confined m one of the old Portuguese forts, where conditions are medieval apart from some special accommodation which was provided in 1953 for prisoners sentenced by the Consulate Courts. 24 In 1947 an Egyptian vessel called the Star of Mex went ashore on the coast of Ras al Hadd.( 35 ) Efforts made by one of His Majesty's ships to salve her Med and much of her cargo was looted by local tribesmen. The owners asked the Muscat Government to admit their liability for the damages and loss sustained through looting but so far as is known they received no reply and the matter was oc since the last war persistent efforts have been made to persuade the Sultan to develop his local resources and to give him such assistance m this as was nracticabirhut up to date little or nothing has been done. In 1947 the services o the late Sir Cvril Fox were obtained through the Government of India to carry out « General aeological survey of Dhofar.

He made a number of practical recommendations the first of which was the employment ot experts as fisheries officers. Efforts to obtain such experts from Aden and Pakistan failed. The Foreign Office were then asked to assist and as a result of the enquiries they made, Captain Kendall of Messrs. Chas. Kendall and Partners came forward with a proposal to form a company for the development of the fisheries. He went to Muscat and discussed with the Sultan the grant of a concession to a holding company who would pass it on to another company to operate. The Sultan found that Kendall's intention was to obtain a monopoly and then sell it to the highest bidder and refused to accept the proposal. Kendall on his side complained of the unwillingness of the Sultan to make up his mind and of obstruction by vested interests. Nothing came of the matter and no further action has yet been taken on Dr. Bertram's recommendations. A small concession for extracting shark oil has however been given to a Bombay firm and in 1953 some Japanese firms were reported to be showing an interest in the Gwadur fisheries. The vested interests to which Kendall referred were represented chiefly by a Khojah called Haji Bhacker who controlled most of the fish export trade from Muscat. He died in 1953. At one time he operated a fish-meal factory at Matrah but he later found it more profitable to export the raw material to Europe for processing there. 27. Mr. Hartley who was serving as Agricultural Officer at Aden carried out an agricultural survey of Dhofar in 1947 and of the Batinah at the end of 1949. He reported that Dhofar was ideal for the production of certain kinds of fruit but that there was no market for it. He recommended the lining of the water-channels with concrete and the use of fertilisers, and advised against any ambitious scheme for producing and refining sugar. The Sultan in 1949 asked His Majesty's Government to obtain for him the services of an agricultural officer for Dhofar but when one was found for him he stated that he did not require him. In 1953 he renewed his request. With regard to the Batinah Mr. Hartley reported that the area under cultivation could be greatly extended if pumps were made available to lift the water. He suggested that fruit and vegetables should be the chief crops grown with a view to their supply to the oil companies. The Sultan agreed to the purchase of a certain number of pumps and to the establishment of a farm of 200 acres near Sohar for experimental and demonstration purposes, and the consent of the Government of Pakistan was obtained to the employment of one of their agricultural officers. The whole scheme has however been abandoned for the time being, possibly because the Sultan feels that he requires all his resources for dealing with the situation created by the presence of Turki at Buraimi. 28. In 1946 the oil company despatched a water geologist to Muscat to report amongst other things on the possibility of water development for the supply of Muscat and Matrah towns. He carried out a brief survey and recommended that the Sultan should take the advice of a firm of consulting engineers. This he did and subsequently on the basis of the advice received elaborate schemes were I PJ! e P are ^ ky Messrs. Holloway Brothers for a piped water supply not only for Muscat and Matrah but also for Sur. The Sultan found these too expensive. Since then Woods BaUard has constructed a dam in a ravine in the hills above Muscat which has had little effect on the water supply and apart from this nothing nas been done. p • ? 9 rv h 1 . 195 2 the Sultan asked the United States Consul-General, Dhahran, for Point IV aid He was offered the sum of 100,000 dollars to cover he services of mmeraJogical, agricultural and fisheries experts, who would carry out surveys and asked to sign an agreement accepting the conditions on which the aid was to be afforded. He had not signed this by the end of 1953 and it is probable 11^1 he does not wish to pursue the proposal as he has failed to reply to letters which thlnnitS States Consul-General has written to him on the subject Orpaiiisatlon' ol'whfch^Muscat 'k' nn?' 6 ' 8 ' A ^ airs ( . a PP lie d to the World Health measures and the conservation nf rain 3 nlen ^ er - / or assistance in anti-malarial measures ana tne conservation ot ram water, but in 1953 when thev were rpa.lv to send an advisory team to Muscat the Sultan put them off (') 31. The story of development in Muscat is a sad one.' A number of survevs h f® be rI e i ca ^ led f 0 ' t and re P 0 [. , | written but nothing has been donenartlv because of the difficulty of finding qualified experts willing To serve in Muscat on salaries [fires D'.o;,i 181 which the State can afford and partly because of the lack of resources to implement the proposals which have been made. The Sultan has said that he does not want any more experts who will only look at the country and write reports; what he requires is somebody who can suggest and implement small practical schemes and teach his people improved methods. III.— Relations between the Sultan and the Ibadhi Tribes of Oman 32. Relations between the Sultan and the tribes of the interior excluding those of the Dhahirah and the Buraimi area have been governed throughout the period by the Treaty of Sib (Appendix B).( ;iH ) The Sultan regards this Treaty as of a private nature and will not permit its communication to oil companies. It provides amongst other things for the internal independence of the tribes but is silent about their external relations. Before the Treaty was completed however the tribes' claim to complete independence was rejected by the Sultan and he has always maintained that the whole of the territory is under his sovereignty and that he is therefore responsible for its external relations, an attitude which has been consistently encouraged by Her Majesty's Government. So far as is known this position has never been formally accepted or denied by the Imam but his actions appear to imply his acceptance of it. Though he has written a few letters direct to the British political authorities and to Ibn Saud these have not dealt with important matters and in the recent boundary dispute with Saudi Arabia he wrote to the Sultan saying that he would accept any arrangement made by the Sultan with the British Government. He is believed at one time in 1952 and 1953 to have started issuing travel documents in his own name and to have desisted when he realised the implications of this action. His henchman Salih Ibn Isa, the leader of the Hinawi faction in Oman, stated to the Political Resident in March 1953 that while the Imam was entirely responsible for the internal affairs of Oman the Sultan was responsible for its external affairs.( i9 ) On the other hand the leader of the Ghafiri faction, Sulaiman bin Hamyar, has in recent years asserted his own complete independence of the Sultan and his right to deal direct with the British and other Governments. The possibility of entering into direct relations with the Imam and the Omani tribes has from time to time been considered by Her Majesty's Government but the idea has hitherto been rejected not only because such action would alienate the Sultan but also because it would automatically invalidate the claim of the Iraq Petroleum Company that their concession from the Sultan covers the whole of Oman and would further make it impossible to deny the right of Saudi Arabia to enter into similar relations.( ,0 ) 33. On Sa'id's accession in 1932 there was some discussion about the renewal of the Treaty of Sib, but it was decided that His Majesty's Government should take no hand in the matter.( 41 ) The Treaty was not renewed but is still regarded by both parties to it as being in force. In 1933 when one of the Sultan's subjects was murdered by Omani tribesmen the Sultan was informed under instructions from the Government of India that while the Government of India would accept no responsibility for enforcing the Treaty on either party thereto they were prepared to give their good offices in keeping the peace between them.( 42 ) In 1953 when Salih bin Isa asked the Political Resident what action Her Majesty's Government would take if the Sultan broke the terms of the Treaty he was given a similar reply. 34. The Treaty has worked well and there have been few breaches of it. Any disputes which have arisen have usually been settled by discussion between the Sultan and tribal representatives. In 1943 there was agitation in Oman over restrictions on the export of rice from Muscat and some talk of denouncing the Treaty. The eldest son of Isa Bin Salih the Hinawi leader visited the Political Agent in the absence of the Sultan in Dhofar, in order to complain. It was found possible to persuade him that the shortage of rice was not the fault of the Muscat Government and arrangements were made for the Omanis to receive their share of wheat and barley in its place.

Although the Imam and the tribesmen are content with the I reaty the , Sultan resents the restrictions it places on his sovereignty. From the early days of his reign he has been trying to ingratiate himself with the tribal Shaikhs by entertaining them when they come to Muscat, by giving them presents of money, though not on a very lavish scale, and by displaying his orthodoxy as an Ibadhi Muslim. He has, it is believed, cherished a hope that when the Imam, who is old and frequently ailing, dies he will be accepted as ruler of the interior in his place. He does not wish to be elected as Imam, as this would involve recognition oi the elective principle and would not ensure the continuance of the dynastic rule of his family over Oman.( 43 ) Apart from this on at least three occasions he has asked for the assistance of Her Majesty's Government in subjugation of Oman by force. In 1939 he proposed to raise a force of 1,000 men to re-assert his authority and maintain control and threatened to retire for good to Dhofar or to abdicate if he were not given financial assistance for this and other projects. On this occasion events were overtaken by the War. In 1945 he was encouraged by the illness of the Imam and approaches made to him by tribal leaders to make another plan for the conquest of Oman and in 1946 asked for the assistance of the Royal Air Force for this purpose. When this was refused because it would give rise to much criticism and might lead to the arraignment of His Majesty's Government before the Security Council of the United Nations( 44 ) the Sultan abandoned his scheme and would not accept a proposal that a small expedition led by a British Political Officer and including technical oil experts under an armed escort provided by the Sultan should visit the interior to make contact with the leading Shaikhs. While he was in London in 1953 in an interview with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs he again asked for financial assistance to raise a force of 1,500 men for the conquest of 'Oman but it was considered impolitic to encourage such a venture. 36. The Imam Muhammad bin Abdullah al Khalili was elected on the assassination of his predecessor in 1920 and in 1953 was believed to be about 75 years old. He is often ailing and since about 1938 has from time to time been reported to be on the point of death.( 15 ) Tribal representatives have from time to time discussed the election of a successor but have decided that this would not be proper during his life-time. In 1952 however they elected an assistant to work with him, in order to give themselves an opportunity of judging the suitability of this assistant to succeed him in due course. The Imam resides at Nizwah and most of the tribes of the interior acknowledge his sway as far north as Ibn, which he occupied in 1941, at the southern end of the Dhahirah. He also has influence over the tribes in the desert west ol the mountains. There are however one or two tribes even in central Oman such as the Janabah of Izz who acknowledge neither him nor the Sultan. He is represented by Walis in numerous centres maintains law and order through armed retainers and collects zakat on dates'and other produce. Muhammadan law is rigorously enforced and he is his own Chief Oadhi His rule is reported to be just and according to one traveller a sort of primitive golden age has until recently prevailed. Modernising influences are carefully excluded, and so far as is known doctors from the American Mission at Muscat are the only Christians who have been permitted to visit the territory under his influence during recent years. The tribes have enjoyed peace for a generation unde^ his rule. There have been occasional tribal affrays but he has quickly intervened o restore order. Although it is difficult to believe that the Imam is ignorant of the Sultans ambitions relations between them are friendly and thev have co-operated closely in the crisis created by the Saudis' occupation of Hamasah in Buraimi. 37. The first Omam tribal leader who showed a desire to change the quo was Sulaiman bin Hamyar. In 1946 he wrote a letter direct to the United ?n™ e l ConSl ! ] f Dhal l ran who asked the Sultan to reply to it on his behalf In 1950 he made two indirect approaches to the Political Resident for independent . recognition In the following year he performed the pilgrimage to Mecca and on both his outward and return journeys called on His Majesty's representatives in the Persian Gulf and repeated his request, but was told that his relations with His Majesty s Government must be conducted through the Sultan In 1952 he went to see Turki, the Saudi Amir in Buraimi, and was sent on to see Ibn Sand in ( 43 ) I.O. to F.O.

He does not appear to have declared himself a Saudi subject but still asserts his independence as Ruler of the Jabal Akhdar. He issues his own travel documents and refuses to accept a Sultanate passport. It is reported that on his return from Riyadh the Imam declared him an infidel and his assassination lawful. Since then however he appears to have made his peace with the Imam. 38. After Turki's arrival in Buraimi the Ibadhi tribesmen except for a few under Sulaiman's control rallied behind the Sultan and the Imam and would undoubtedly have attacked Turki had not Her Majesty's Government asked the Sultan to hold his hand. The present situation is confused and with the Imam's increasing weakness his administration is disintegrating. It would appear however that the Imam and the Hinawis are at one with the Sultan in their opposition to the Saudis and that by no means all of the Ghafiris are prepared to follow Sulaiman's lead. It is predicted that when the Imam dies serious fighting will break out between the two factions and whether this will be to the advantage of the Sultan or the Saudis remains to be seen. The latter have not yet claimed sovereignty oyer the Omani tribes but only asserted their right to deal with them direct as being independent. The tribal leaders are now anxious for an oil company to enter their country and it is probable that many of the tribesmen share this view, as large numbers of them have worked for oil companies in the Shaikhdoms and Saudi Arabia and seen the prosperity of the countries where oil has been found. The main obstacle to oil exploitation at present is not the fanaticism of the Imam but the fact that the Shaikhs do not want to share their profits with the Sultan. m h IY # Relations between the Sultan and the Sunni Tribes of the Dhahirah and the Buraimi area 39. These tribes were not signatories of the Treaty of Sib. The Imam maintains a Wali at Ibri at the southern end of the Dhahirah, and the Bani Ali and a few other tribesmen are subject to the Sultans influence but for the most part the tribes assert their independence both of the Sultan ano the imam and m 1952 a number of Shaikhs announced their allegiance to Ibn Saud About three- quarters of the Buraimi oasis, but not Buraimi village itself, is under the effective control of the Ruler of Abu Dhabi. This territory is not claimed by the Sultan and is outside the scope of this section. 40. Lorimer describes the Dhahirah as part of the Sultanate of Oman. Writing in the first decade of this century he reports that the hold of the Sultan on the district was slight but that he maintained a Wali supported by a garnson at Araqi He classifies both Jau, in which Buraimi lies and Mahadhah, the headquarters of the Bani Kaab, to the north ol it as ^dependent 0 m an . The Sultan bases his claim to Buraimi on its capture from the Wahhabis by his nredecessor Azzan in 1869. The latter installed a garrison there but it is unlikely fo have stayed there long as Azzan was driven from the throne the following year and dvnastic fighting and tribal insurrections continued for a number of years. We then no Sultan appears to have made any attempt to mstal a Wall or enforce l anH order in the area. In 1929 Sultan Faisal refused an invitation from the leading Na'im Shaikh to visit Buraimi on the score of expense. The present Sultan leading JNa f n pctahlish his authority over the whole area but has frequently been urged f the Dhahuah m 1945 and his Minister of the beyond sending h.s brother , ]2Z1 the mara route between, the R n ithiah and BuraM m 1948 and to assist the oil company in their negotiations Batman ana Burainu, u , d to take p 0SltlV e action until Turki with the Buraimi tribes in '. U a i| owances set himself they visLd him and in 1951 to some of the Shaikns ana ™nies of a number of letters from them he gave the Political R esl P ^ t0 g e ther with a copy of an agreement acknowledging their . ° D „ ed '®' C 0 ®n t i n „ th e leading Na'im Shaikh, Saqr bin Sultan, signed by them a PP 0 J^mg the leac ^ ^ ^ to communi with the ol'cTmpaS') Subsequent events have shown these documents to be of little value. 46639f 184 i i 41. The oil company, viz., Petroleum Development (Oman and Dhofar) Limited (paragraph 60 below), started exploration in the area in November 1938. One party of geologists set out from the Batinah Coast and visited Yanqul, the Jabal Hafit and Buraimi, and another proceeded from Sharjah via Abu Dhabi territory to Buraimi and the Jabal Hafit. They found the Shaikhs impossible to negotiate with and after surveying a small area both parties withdrew. In 1939 the company negotiated with the Ruler of Abu Dhabi for another visit to the area but as these negotiations proved unsuccessful they approached the Sultan. The Sultan gave his consent to the expedition provided motor transport was not used and entry was made to the area from his territory and not from Abu Dhabi. The company made the ban on motor vehicles an excuse for abandoning the enterprise. In 1946 a representative of the company paid a brief visit to Buraimi from the Trucial Coast to establish food and petrol dumps but apart from this no further attempts was made to penetrate the area until 1948 when a representative of the company without consulting the Sultan entered into agreements with some of the Shaikhs for the exploration of their territory in return for cash payments. When the Sultan heard of this he was very angry. A modus vivendi was eventually reached with him but he asked that action should be postponed until the following year. In 1949 the company's representative again visited the Buraimi area and the Sultan sent his Minister of the Interior with him. Negotiations broke down owing to the exorbitant demands of Shaikh Saqr of the Na'im and the fact that the shaikhs refused to accord the Sultan's representative any facilities or to enter into any agreement in which the Sultan's sovereignty over their territory was recognised. In 1952 the company made plans for another visit to the Buraimi area and drafted an agreement which they proposed to negotiate with the Shaikhs after consultation with the Sultan but they abandoned their proposal when Turki established himself at Hamasah. The company have no great hopes of finding oil in the area but wish to obtain access through it to more promising country further south. A' ^ Sh a mis, Shaikh of Hamasah in Buraimi and a Baluch Shaikh from the Dhahirah visited Riyadh and on their return hoisted the Saudi flag and started to issue Saudi travel documents. Two or three of the other Shaikhs thereupon visited the Political Officer at Sharjah and demanded that Her Majesty's Government and the oil company should enter into direct relations with them. On failing to obtain a satisfactory reply they went to Riyadh. On August 31 Turki bin Ataishan, who had been the Saudi Amir at Ras Tanurah. arrived at Hamasah with an armed escort of about 40 men and established himself as the Saudi Amir there. Thereupon all the leading Shaikhs declared their allegiance to Ibn Saud, except a few at the southern end of the Dhahirah, who were under the influence of the Sultan or the Imam, and Saqr bin Sultan the Na'im Shaikh at Buraimi village. The Sultan sent a small force to support Saqr and also gave him some financial assistance. With the encouragement of Her Majesty's Government the Sultan collected a large tribal force in the Batinah to deal with the tribes who had gone over to the Saudis and to assert his authority over the Buraimi area. He obtained the co-operation of the Imam who assembled a smaller force at Ibn (paragraph 38 above). By the middle of October however c aS H rea f dy ^ forward he was asked to hold his hand as negotiations with the Saudis for the settlement of the dispute by arbitration were in hand and it was feared that an advance by him in Buraimi might provoke a general conflict. He at once complied but has seized the occasion to saddle Her Majesty's Government with responsibility for all subsequent developments and in future when urged to assert his authority over the tribes will be able to plead that when he attempts to do so he is not permitted. 43. As in the case of Central Oman, Her Majesty's Government have from time to time considered a proposal to enter into direct relations with the tribes of the area and have rejected it for the same reasons (paragraph 32 above) Until recently, however, the Bani Ka'ab of Mahadhah have not been regarded as bem' on the same footing as the other tribes. So far as is known the Sultan made no claim to sovereignty over this tribe until 1926 when Mr. Bertram Thomas states that he secured their precarious attachment to MuscaU') Amongst the documents produced by the Sultan in 1931 (paragraph 40 above) is a verv forthrieht declaration of allegiance by their leading Shaikh Obaid bin Juma. In spite of this, (48) « Alarms and Excursions in Arabia,' p. 165.185 Obaid went over to the Saudis in 1952. A cousin of his, Abdullah bin Salim, whose father had once been the paramount Shaikh, shortly afterwards asked Her Majesty's Government to support his claim to the leadership of the tribe. Although care had been taken previously not to recognise the Sultan's claim to sovereigntly over the tribe it now became politic to do so, and Abdullah was sent to Muscat to make his submission. After that, with the Sultan's approval he received Her Majesty's Government's support against Obaid, and the latter fled from Mahadhah. It will be necessary therefore in future to regard the Bani Ka'ab as the Sultan's subjects unless provision is made to the contrary in any settlement of the boundary dispute which may be reached with the Saudis. V.—Gwadur 44. Although Gwadur has been under the sovereignty of Muscat since 1792 it was not included in the district of the Political Agent, Muscat until 1934. The Sultan maintains a Wali there and a small garrison. In 1946 having failed to obtain the services of a British officer for which he had asked he appointed an Indian Administrator to look after municipal affairs, and in 1949 the latter's place was taken by a British Administrator. A school and a dispensary are maintained, and the services of an Indian or Pakistani doctor are obtained from time to time, but he rarely stays for more than a few months. The British Administrator s attempts to improve conditions are hampered by lack of funds. The bulk of the population is Baluch, but in Gwadur town there are about 400 Ismali Khojas or Agakhams and 100 Hindus. Before the transfer of power in India these were all British subjects, as protected persons. The Hindus have now become Indian subjects while the Agakhanis are endeavouring to obtain citizenship of the United Kingdom for which it is probable that few of them have the requisite qualifications. British interests are in charge of an official who used to be called the British Agent, but since 1952 has been designated Pro-Consul. He exercises judicial powers under the Muscat Order-in-Council. The chief value of Gwadur to the Sultan l ies J' 11 its customs revenue which is usually much in excess of his expenditure on e place. 45. Before the transfer of power the Khan of Kalat never relinquished his claim to sovereignty over Gwadur.C) He renewed it [ n w hen the question of an oil concession for the territory arose (paragraph 65 below). In 1927 the Political Resident proposed the purchase of Gwadur by His Majesty s Government owing to its importance as a staging-post in the air route which was then under discussion.( 50 ) He suggested a sum of £135,000 as [he purchase price and to 25 per cent, of this should be paid to the Khan of KalaU ) Nothing came ot the nrooosal In 1939 the Sultan who at the time wished to raise funds for the conquest of Oman asked the Political Resident whether he thought the Govern ment of India would be willing to lease or buy Gwadur from him,( ) but owing to the outbreak of war the matter was not pursued then. Early in 1947 the Government of India tentatively raised the question of the retrocession of Gwadur bv sale to Kalat State( 53 ) but dropped it because there was not time to deal with the ., Kpfnrp the transfer of power in India. Before that event took place the Khan sought permiss ^on to negotiate direct with the Sultan for the return of Gwadur but it was decided that he could not be permitted to have direct relations • i f oirrt-i nnvprnment before the lapse of paramountcy.( ) After the with any foreign delayed his accession to Pakistan, and the Pakistan rov^rnnwnf recognised the Province of Mekran, within the limits of which Gwadur Government recogins Nawab who had announced his P.'.S kh' ' y Gwadur. . . 46., In 1948 S fpprolch^d with' proposal for the sale of Gwadur.

In reporting this the Political Resident suggested that before the Sultan was encouraged to dispose of Gwadur, its importance to His Majesty's Government from the points of view of strategy and air communications should be considered.C' 5 ) This was done and the conclusion reached was that as the Royal Air Force and immediate civil air interests were limited to obtaining a continuation of the facilities granted to His Majesty's Government under the civil air agreement of 1947 and to the long-term and rather doubtful possibility that Gwadur might become an important oil port, His Majesty's Government should not insist on their rights under the agreement of 1891 to the prejudice of any approach which the Government of Pakistan might make to the Sultan for the sale or return of Gwadur.C'') 47. Early in 1949 the Pakistan Government raised the question of the cession to them of Gwadur, and after asserting ' an irresistible claim ' on legal grounds offered to pay a price for it equal to the gross customs revenue for the ten years preceding the war.( 57 ) It was only to be expected that they would try to obtain the possession of the place. Quite apart from their obvious objections to the existence of a Muscat enclave in their territory and the possible commercial and strategic value of the place as a port, they were suffering substantial loss of revenue from its use as a centre for smuggling. There is also evidence to show that they had quite ungrounded fears that the Sultan might cede it to India. The Sultan was asked whether he would agree to sell Gwadur, and told that His Majesty's Government viewed the proposal favourably, but he replied that he did not feel able to take such an irrevocable decision which would alienate ancestral property and might antagonise public opinion.^ 8 ) When the Sultan visited Pakistan at the end of 1949 some unofficial approaches were made to him on the subject of Gwadur and on his return he informed the Political Resident that he was unwilling either to sell or lease the place.( 59 ) In 1950 reports were received of agitation in Mekran for the return of Gwadur fostered by the Nawab and of tribal gatherings to attack the place. There was some propaganda on the Pakistan radio and an attempt was made to blockade the enclave by land. The Pakistan Government gave an assurance that they were strongly opposed to any activities aimed at the forcible occupation of Gwadur and undertook to restrain the Nawab.( 60 ) The Political Resident was instructed to pass this information to the Sultan and at the same time to warn him that His Majesty's Government could not accept responsibility for the protection of Gwadur.( 61 ) The Pakistan Foreign Minister raised the question of Gwadur when he was on a visit to London in July 1950 and stressed the anxiety of his Government to obtain possession of the whole enclave either by sale or lease. He indicated that Pakistan would make a generous offer.( 62 ) In 1951 the Pakistan Government wished to send a delegation to Muscat to convey their offer to the Sultan, but he obstinately refused to receive it on the ground that Pakistan was a Dominion and that he had always dealt with British Dominions through His Majesty's Government^ 63 ) He stated that he would make an offer regarding Gwadur if the matter were dealt with by His Majesty's Government^ 64 ) He subsequently enquired in writing whether the agreement of 1891 regarding the cession of the territory( 65 ) was still valid and received a reply in the affirmative^ 66 ) He orally called the Political Agent's attention to the fact that this agreement prohibited him absolutely from ceding territory to anybody other than the British Government, and that no provision was made for cession with the permission of that Government. The Pakistan Government were informed of the Sultan's refusal to receive a delegation and told that His Majesty's Government were willing to transmit their offer regarding Gwadur if they so desired.( 67 ) They replied that they ( 55 ) P.R. to F.O.

He replied that for reasons of prestige he could never agree to the sale of Gwadur but that he might be willing to consider its lease to Her Majesty's Government for sub-lease to Pakistan, especially if some outward and visible sign of his sovereignty was retained there.( 69 ) This was passed on to the Pakistan Government. Early in 1953 they returned to the charge. They again expressed anxiety lest the Sultan might dispose of the territory to India in view of his recent conclusion of a treaty with that country and also complained of the smuggling of goods and the illegal entry of immigrants via Gwadur. The whole matter was discussed with the Pakistan Prime Minister and other Pakistani officials in London in June 1953. The Pakistanis maintained their legal right to the possession of Gwadur but expressed their willingness to pay something to the Sultan on the basis of a direct lease of the territory to Pakistan. It was agreed that Her Majesty's Government and the Pakistan Government should exchange all documents in their possession bearing on the legal question, and that the former should make a fresh review of it. It was also agreed that the Legal Adviser on the United Kingdom side should prepare the draft of a document which, while securing Pakistan's requirements, would stand a chance of acceptance by the Sultan.( 70 ) The legal advisers held that there was no doubt that the Sultan had acquired sovereignty over Gwadur by prescription and prepared a draft form of lease. Their opinion and the draft were passed on to the Commonwealth Relations Office for transmission to the Pakistan Government to whom it was to be suggested that they should endeavour to acquire control of Gwadur by leasing the territory direct from the Sultan. They were to be advised that Her Majesty's Government were ready to lend their good offices in attempting to negotiate such a lease but it was emphasised that they could not bring pressure to bear upon the Sultan.( 71 ) 48. In 1953 the Pakistan Government extended their customs regime to Pasni east of Gwadur on the Mekran coast and placed an official who had previously been Director of Customs at Muscat in charge of customs there. A blockade was instituted to prevent smuggling both into and out of Gwadur. It caused some distress until ways and means had been found of evading it. VI.—Boundaries (a) With the Trucial States 49. The Sultan when asked to define his frontiers with the Trucial Shaikhdoms usually refuses to co-operate and says that it is for others to state their claims and for him then to say whether he accepts them or not.( 72 ) So far as is known the position is as follows: — {a) The frontier of the Sultan's territory in the Musandam peninsula begins at Ras Sha'am on the west side of the peninsula and ends at Dibah bay on its east side. Between these points it has not been determined. The Shaikh of Bakhah on the west side of the peninsula at one time claimed to be independent but after the trouble between Bakhah and Sha'am in 1950 admitted himself to be a subject of the Sultan. The latter at the same time claimed part of Sha'am as his territory on the ground that the Shihuh who occupy it were his subjects but this claim was not admitted by the Political Resident and was not seriously pressed.The Sultan complains from time to time of encroachments by Ras al Khaimah in the vicinity of Khatt and it is desirable that the whole course of the frontier should be determined. ib) The western end of the northern frontier of the rest of the Sultanate with the Trucial Shaikhdoms is difficult to define, and is in any case subject to the result of the dispute with the Saudis. For present purposes the starting point may be regarded as the crest of Jabal Hafit ridge, the / 6 8\ pro to F O SA 44/6/1 of May 16, 1952 (EA 1085/5 of 1952). - PR. to F.O 1034/14/52 of August 8, 1952 (EA 1085/6 of 1952).

In the Buraimi oasis the villages of Buraimi and Hamasah and the hamlet of Suarah belong to Muscat and the rest to Abu Dhabi. The Sultan and the Ruler of Abu Dhabi are on good terms and up to date there has been no friction over boundary questions. North of Buraimi Bani Ka'ab country may be included in Sultanate territory with its eastern boundary in the vicinity of the Sharjah-Buraimi road. Its northern boundary is either south or north of the Wadi Hatta. The Bani Ka'ab claim this Wadi, both Dubai and Ajman own villages in it and the Muscat frontier post is a few miles east of the main watershed. (As is customary in Arabia the Wadi bears the same name on both sides of the watershed.) From this point the frontier runs north and crosses the Wadi al Qaur near its eastern debouchure into the costal plain. It then turns east and runs down a ridge and across the coastal plain to the sea between Murair and Khor Kalba. The Sultan has a frontier post at Khatam al Malahah where the ridge meets the plain. In 1953 the Ruler of Sharjah claimed a small village north of the Wadi al Qaur as part of the previous Shaikhdom of Kalba, but after an inspection of the spot he was informed that it appeared to belong to Muscat and should be so treated. It is probable that other disputes will arise about the boundary in this area until it has been properly defined. {b) With Saudi Arabia 50. In 1937 the Sultan with considerable reluctance stated in writing that he would raise no objections if the eastern limits of the territory belonging to Ibn Saud « were defined by a line based on the following points : — » ; The intersection of 52° E. and 23° N. '•— tpI i ) The intersection of 54° 40' E. and 22° 40' N. ^ The intersection of 55° 40 / E. and 22° N! The intersection of 55° E. and 20° N. The intersection of 52° E. and 19° N.( 73 ) \ A reply was sent to him that His Majesty's Government had taken note of the fact that while he was unable to state precisely the limits of his claims he laid no claim to any territory beyond the line he had defined.( 7 ') He has made no further pronouncement on the subject. At his request Her Majesty's Government are acting on his behalf in the negotiations with the Saudis on the subject of their south-eastern frontier which have been in progress since 1949. Until these negotiations have been brought to a successful conclusion it will be impossible to give any more accurate definition of the frontier between Oman and Saudi Arabia than that suggested by the Sultan. (c) Dhofar boundary 51. Lorimer states the Dhofar extends along the coast from Ras Dharbat Ali including Kharifot on the west to Ras Nus on the east.( 75 ) In 1929 Sultan Taimur stated in writing that the province extended from Ras Dharbat Ali on the west to the Wadi Rikut on the east.( 76 ) In 1946 the present Sultan informed a representative of the oil company that the area defined as Dhofar extended from Ras Dharbat Ali along the coast to about Ras Timrar beyond Jabal Samhan on the east and northwards to Ramlat al Mughsin and westwards to the Mahra.( 77 ) In 1947 he marked on a map what he regarded as the boundaries of Dhofar.( 78 ) In this the eastern boundary on the coast is shown as Ras Hasik just east of Jabal Samhan but he was only questioned at the time about the western boundary. The abandonment by Petroleum Concessions Limited of their Dhofar concession (paragraph 64 below) gave him grounds for wishing to extend the boundaries of the province and in June 1953 he informed the Political Resident that its eastern 56. boundary on the coast should be fixed at Ras Sharbatat, as the Bautahara tribe ( 73 ) E 3845/258/91 (1937).

The Political Resident was instructed to express a hope to the Sultan that he would not set aside his father's and his own previous definition. He approached the Sultan accordingly but was unable to persuade him to change his mind.( 79 ) 52. Ras Dharbat Ali appears to have been accepted by the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra as the western limit of the province on the coast. From here it has been stated that the boundary runs in a north-easterly direction along the Wadi Hanna whence it turns north-west and joins the Wadi Masilah.( S0 ) A more detailed description of it is to be found in a report furnished by Mr. W. H. Ingrams in 1935.( 81 ) 53. At the end of 1953 the Sultan gave Her Majesty's Consui-General the co-ordinates of what he then regarded as the boundary of the province as follows: Ras Sharbatat-20 o N 55 C E-19 0 N 53 0 E-18 o 45^ 52 0 E-18 0 N 52° 20 , E- 17° lO'N 52° 45 / E-Ras Dharbat Ali.( 82 ) This involves a slight modification of the northern boundary previously claimed by the Sultan (paragraph 50 above) and appears to place the western boundary substantially to the west of that referred to in the last preceding paragraph and of that shown in the War Office 1/1 million map of 1949. It was proposed to consult the Government of Aden before expressing any views on the matter to the Sultan. {d) Gwadur boundary 54. The application of two oil companies for a concession for Gwadur in 1938 at once raised the question of the demarcation of the frontier between the Sultan's territory and Kalat State. The Khan of Kalat took up the attitude that the mineral rights in Gwadur belonged to him as the Sultan only held the place for him in fief and that no demarcation was therefore necessary. He was told that the Government of India would not support this claim.( 8 ! ) The Sultan refused to negotiate with the Khan and insisted on dealing direct with the Government of India. The latter proposed to set up a boundary commission consisting of representatives of the two States each accompanied by a Political Officer. With the withdrawal by the two companies of their applications for a concession and the outbreak of war the whole matter was dropped. 55. In 1945 difficulty was experienced in deciding whether a certain murderer should be tried by the Kalat or the Muscat Courts because it was uncertain within which territory the murders concerned had been committed. The Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan accordingly proposed a boundary which he recommended should be observed by the Government of India's officers in Baluchistan and the Persian Gulf as the boundary so far as they were concerned for jurisdictional and similar purposes without any communication on the subject being made either to the Khan of Kalat or the Sultan of Muscat. The boundary proposed and the recommendations were accepted by the Government of India. It has not been defined geographically but is marked on a map which was forwarded by the Government of India to the India Office and other authorities.( 84 ) It gives Muscat roughly an area within a radius of 20 miles round Gwadur and approximates it is believed fairly closely to what is in fact at present treated as the boundary by both the Mekran State officials and the Sultan's officials in Gwadur. The Pakistan Government who are presumably in possession of the 1946 papers have not raised the question of the boundary probably because they hope to acquire the whole territory. VII.—Islands 56. So far as is known no dispute exists over any of the Muscat islands. In 1913 Little Quoin island was selected as a site for a lighthouse because ' not being Muscat territory its selection would involve no risk of difficulties with the Sultan.' f 79 ) Tel. from P.R. to P.O. 38, Saving, of September 5, 1953 (EA 15311/9 of 1953).

In 1951 when the Persian Gulf Lighting Service wished to erect a radio beacon on the island the Political Resident recommended that the Quoin Islands should be regarded as Muscat territory and the Sultan's approval obtained.C s ') This recommendation was accepted and approval obtained accordingly. 57. The Kuria Muria Islands, which are known locally as the Jazair Bin Ghalfan, off the southern coast of Arabia were ceded to Queen Victoria in 1854 by Sultan Said L( 86 ) They are nominally part of the Aden Colony but are dealt with administratively by the Political Resident.C 7 ) There are about fifty persons living on Hallaniyah and the other islands are uninhabited. Hallaniyah is visited from time to time by one of Her Majesty's ships with or without a Political Officer on board. On such occasions a few provisions are usually presented to the inhabitants who are extremely poor but otherwise nothing is done for their welfare. In 1950 they described themselves as Sultanate subjects and they probably derive from Murbat on the mainland from which place they obtain their supplies. The islands are now of no commercial or strategic value and in 1949 the Political Resident suggested that they might be offered to the Sultan as an inducement to part with Gwadur. The suggestion was not accepted as it was thought that there might be an advantage in retaining them for use as a quid pro quo on some other occasion.( 88 ) vm.—on {a) Muscat and Oman 58. The oil concession granted to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1925( 89 ) appears to have been abandoned owing to the disappointing results of geological surveys. 59. At the end of 1935 the Sultan asked the Political Agent to find a British company to prospect tor oil in his territories. In the following year he was told that a company had been found and would send a representative to visit him. Nothing came of this for the time being and in January 1937 he apparently on his own initiative sent some samples of oil seepages in Muscat to the Standard Oil Company of California. Some correspondence between him and the company followed and at the beginning of June the Political Resident was instructed to press the Sultan to submit any communication he wished to make to the companv through official channels and to remind him of his obligations not to grant an oil concession without consulting and without the approval of His Majesty's Government.{ ) No action was taken on this as by the time the instructions reached the Political Agent a representative ol Petroleum Concessions Limited had arrived in Muscat and started negotiations with the Sultan. These were rapidly completed and an agreement was signed on June 24.C 1 ) The agreement covers all the territory within the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, except Dhofar and Gwadur, but under Article 12 the company recognises that certain parts of the territory are not safe for its operations and the Sultan undertakes to use his good offices with a view to making it possible for representatives of the company to enter such parts to inform the company as soon as they became safe. The agreement is lor 75 years but it included an option of five years within which the companv were at liberty to terminate it. The company undertook to pay the Sultan Rs. 100,000 on signature and Rs. 5,000 a month during the option^ period. On declaring their intention ol taking up the concession they were to oav a further sum of Rs. 100,000 plus Rs. 84,000 a year for the first five years and Rs 96 000 a year for subsequent years unless the royalty payable to the Sultan at the rate'of Rs 3/- per ton of oil exceeded these amounts. In 1942 the option period was extended for two years and on May 8, 1944, the company made a declaration in writing taking up the concession.

When the original agreement was signed it was decided to ask the company to enter into a Political Agreement with Her Majesty's Government and by an exchange of letters to obtain the Sultan's agreement to any obligations which might devolve upon him as a result of it. Drafts of the documents were prepared and presented to the Sultan in November 1937. His reactions are reported to have been ' startingly hostile' no doubt on account of what he regarded as infringements of his independence. The whole matter was discussed with him in London in 1938 and various amendments were made in the drafts which removed his objections to them. In the course of the discussions the Sultan was informed that His Majesty's Government would in due course notify him in writing of their approval of the concession which he had granted.C 2 ) He objected strongly to this on the ground that his father's undertaking of 1923 was not binding on him (paragraph 11 above). He eventually agreed to a notification being sent to him as proposed but said he would merely file it and not acknowledge it. It is interesting to note that later in the year one of the companies competing for the Gwadur oil concession gave a written statement to him to the effect that any agreement between them and him would be contingent upon the approval ot His Majesty's Government and that he suggested that the other company which was competing should be instructed to do the same.( 93 ) An associate of Petroleum Concessions Limited called Petroleum Development (Oman and Dhofar) Limited was formed to operate both the concession for Muscat and Oman and that for Dhofar which was obtained at the same time and in September 1938 His Majesty's Government entered into two Political Agreementsf 4 ) with this company, one a General Agreement, ol which the Sultan had agreed to take cognisance in an exchange of letters, and the other a Pre-emption Agreement which was not to be shown to the Sultan. 1 ne exchange of letters with the Sultan took place m November 1938 and he accepted the General Political Agreement and its implications so far as he was concerned subject to one small amendment being made in its terms.( ) The agreement was amended accordingly and the Political Resident was instructed to inform he Sultan that His Majesty's Government had no objection to the concession granted by him,( 96 ) 61 In March 1951 after the abandonment of the Dhofar concession (naragraoh 64 below) the company operating the Muscat and Oman concession changed its name to Petroleum Development (Oman) Ltd. In 1953 it appointed a local representative to reside in Muscat. 62 Earlv surveys showed that there was little hope of finding oil in territory under the Sultan's full control, but from aerial surveys there appcaredtobea good orosoect of finding it in the foothills to the west and south-west of the mam Hajar ranse The company's efforts to obtain access to this area from the north have already been described (paragraph 41 above). When these failed they began to examine the^possibility of approaching it from the south. In 1949 a scheme was devised for landing on the southern coast of Arabl f a force of 200 men and penetrating the interior via the Huqf Wadi. Ihis has since been known as the Huqf Scheme although its scope was eventually limited to an area up to 50 kilometres only from the coast. The matter was first broached with the Suftan in 1949 and received by him with enthusiasm. Discussions regarding it continued throughout 1950 and 1951 and it was finally approved in principle by Her Maiestv's Government in April 1952 provided that the company agreed no to Lter any area except with the Sultan's approval and support and after he haa established himself there.C 7 ) The Sultan insisted on a force of not less than 400 m^n tn he mid for entirely by the company until oil was found and the royalties DOTaWe on ^^vere Sufficient to enable the State to meet the cost Negotiations between the Sultan and the company followed about responsibility for expenditure ancToriier matters and an agreement was finally reached in January 1953 whereby and otner maiL ^ - th i itia | cost 0 f t he transport required and up to 50 OOo' a'year to cover other expendtore.('«) The collection of equipment was taken in hand and in May a Commandant for the proposed force was appointed.

After his disappearance the prospects of raising the required force became brighter. (b) D ho far 63. The Sultan granted a concession for Dhofar to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. at the same time as he granted them the concession for Muscat and Oman and the terms of the two agreements were identical except that the payments under the Dhofar agreement were smaller and it had attached to it an ' amendment ' covering a number of minor matters peculiar to Dhofar. Its history down to 1944 is the same as that of the Muscat and Oman concession (paragraphs 59-60 above) and the Political Agreement and the exchange of letters with the Sultan cover both concessions jointly. 64. The company carried out a geological survey of a limited area round Salalah in 1938 with disappointing results. After the war the Sultan became impatient at the company's apparent neglect of his favourite province and at the end of 1946 they sent a representative to discuss further exploration with him. A more extensive survey was carried out in 1948 with similar results. When the Sultan learnt of this he pressed the company to abandon the concession if they did not propose to continue the search for oil. After a long delay due to the necessity of obtaining the consent of all their components they finally gave notice on December 20, 1950, of their desire to terminate their concession six months from that date, which the Sultan at once accepted.( 9 ^ He then asked the United States Consul General at Dhahran to find an American company who would be willing to take up a concession. This it appears the Consul General was unable to do and in 1953 the Sultan made an approach on the subject to Mr. Wendell Philipps an American engaged upon archaeological research in Dhofar. In June 1953 he informed the Political Resident that he had granted to the Phil-Pry or Company, which was a concern belonging to Wendell Philipps and not an oil company, a concession free of cost for exploration only for three years. This was to be passed on to any oil company willing to take it up. The terms of an operating concession had been discussed but such a concession would only be granted later if occasion arose. The City Services Company of America have since sent geologists to Dhofar and are reported to be interested in certain areas and to be sending out drilling apparatus. (c) Gwadur . 65. At the end of 1932 the Burmah Oil Company an entirely British concern and Indian Oil Concessions Limited which was half British and half American began to show an interest in Gwadur. In January 1938 both companies were informed by His Majesty s Government that there was no objection to their negotiating with the Sultan provided that their applications to him were submitted throu cr h the Political Agent and the latter was kept in touch with all stages of the negotiations^ 100 ) The companies were also told that the Sultan was under an obligation not to grant a concession without the approval of His Majesty's Government, that any oil concession obtained was subject to such approval and that in deciding whether to grant it or withhold it His Majesty's Government would have amongst other things to take into consideration the difficulties arising from the fact that the boundary between Muscat and Kalat territory had not been demarcated. When the matter was discussed with the Sultan in London he agreed that the demarcation of the boundary would be necessary but insisted that this matter should be arranged between him and the Government of India and not i ^ j ^ j him and the fvhan of Kalat. He went on to say however that he had decided to abandon the negotiations because of the necessity for the apDrovai of the Government to any concessions granted.( 101 ) He subsequently changed his attitude on the latter point and in July promised to stipulate in any concessions which he granted that no operations would be undertaken until the frontier had been demarcated.( ) Both companies applied to the Sultan for a concession and negotiations continued throughout 1938 and into 1939. The Sultan anneared to favour Indian Oil Concessions Limited and there was some discussion fn official circles whether His Majesty s Government should use their influence in an attempt (') P R. to F.O. 1533/3/51 of January 18, 1951 (EA 1536/5 of 1951).

Subsequently Indian Oil Concessions Limited also withdrew their application partly because their survey of neighbouring territory showed that there was little hope of finding oil in Gwadur and partly because of the outbreak of war. Since then no oil company has shown any interest in Gwadur. IX.—Foreign Relations (a) General 66. Before the last war the Sultan's freedom of action in dealing with other foreign powers was a matter of some concern to His Majesty's Government and the Government of India and from time to time ways and means ot curtailing it were discussed. Matters were brought to a head in 1937 when the Sultan wrote direct to the President of the United States of America, without informing the Political Resident, suggesting that he might visit that country. The Political Agent under the instructions of the Political Resident, who had previously consulted the India Office and the Government of India, wrote to the Sultan with reference to this matter pointing out that when it was to the advantage of his State he communicated with foreign powers through His Majesty's Government as in the case of the raising of the Muscat tariffs and asking him in view of his close relations and common interests with His Majesty s Government to inform them o an\ communications which he proposed to make to foreign powers.( ) The Sultan replied that he did not consider his writing direct to the President ot the United States of America, with whom he was in treaty relations, was a breach of his treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. The representations to foreign powers on the subject of the Muscat tariffs were made at his special request and not on the initiative of the Political Resident. He was confident that His Majesty s Goevrnment would never make such demands from him as neither he nor his predecessors were accustomed to. When he had matters m which e noug His Majesty's Government should be consulted he would not fail to do so. he had any communication to foreign powers which he considered it m his mteres to send through His Majesty's Government he would do so but otherwise he would continue to act in accordance with the old procedure. The opinion of the Foreign Office legal expert (Sir Eric Beckett) on the subject was as follows^ ' It would appear that there is no treaty which His Majesty s Government can appeal to as obliging the Sultan of Muscat to consult or even inform His Majesty s Government as regards his dealings with foreign powers unless he was contemplating alienating a bit of his territory in which case the declaration of 189 K 106 ) could be appealed to. Further, as a matter of strict law, it is m fac contrary to the declaration of 18 62( 107 ) for His Majesty's Government to insist that he should do so To compel him to do so is exercising our influence in a manner which a think) is inconsistent with independence.'( 108 ) A suggestion made in the same note that a threat to terminate the Zanzibar subsidy might be used for insisting on His Ma esty's Government being consulted on the Sultans relations with foreign powers was rejected as not being consistent with the conditions of the grant of subsidy.( 109 ) , 67 No further attempt has been made to induce the Sultan to keep His R IS : It Ei SS8 3 « ( 105 ) P.R. to I.O.

On the other hand when he is in difficulties as with the Saudis he asks Her Majesty s Government to act on his behalf. He is willing to receive a communication from a foreign power through Her Majesty's Consul-General when there is no other convenient channel provided it is expressly stated as being made on behall of the power concerned but objects if the Consul-General intervenes on his own initiative, e.g., if he asks for approval to the grant of a visa to the national of a State of whose interests Her Majesty's Government are not in charge unless he can show that he has officially been requested to do so by the State concerned. In 1938 he objected when the Iraqi Government issued a commission to the Political Agent to examine one of his subjects. He subsequently stated that he had no objection to the Political Agent's looking after Iraqi interests in Muscat provided he was officially notified that His Majesty's Government were in charge of Iraqi interests in his State.( 110 ) He was notified accordingly. In 1944 His Majesty's Minister at Jedda was asked by the Saudi Arabian Government to forward to a Court in Muscat a communication from the Shara Court at Mecca. He sent the communication to the Political Resident who in due course replied that the Sultan had asked that the case should be referred to him direct by the Saudi Government. His Majesty's Minister was then instructed to suggest to the Saudi Government that they should address a note direct to the Muscat Government and forward it through His Majesty's Legation to the Political Resident for delivery.( J11 ) 68. An apprehension was previously expressed( 112 ) that the Anglo-French declaration of 1862( 11 ' i ) might act as an impediment to the lease of Muscat territory for a naval base in the Musadam peninsula, but the point does not appear to have been further considered when in 1935 the Sultan's agreement was obtained for the use of Ghanam Island (paragraph 87 below) nor to have been raised when in 1947 a Civil Air Agreement was concluded under which His Majesty's Government pay rent for airfields at Salalah, Masirah and Gwadur (paragraph 92 below). (b) Saudi Arabia 69. So far as is known the present Sultan never entered into any kind of relations personal or official with the late King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud. He undoubtedly regarded him as something of an upstart and always feared aggression at his hands. When boundary negotiations with Saudi Arabia were resumed in 1949 he adhered to the views he had expressed in 1937 about the south-eastern frontier of that country (paragraph 50 above) and asked His Majesty's Government to negotiate on his behalf.( 114 ) He has always expressed inability to find any suitable person to represent him in the various talks which have taken place, and it has been difficult to obtain from him documentary or other evidence in support of his case, his argument usually being that it is for the Saudis to produce their evidence first and then for him to rebut it. The Saudis have refused to recognise his sovereignty over the Buraimi area, the Dhahirah and Oman proper and claim the right to deal direct with the tribes of these tracts as being independent (Chapter 5, paragraph 96). As already related (paragraph 42 above) in 1952 they established an Amir at Hamasah in the Buraimi oasis. (c) Persia 70. So far as is known the instructions issued by the Persian Government to the Governor of Bushire in 1928 that persons belonging to and arriving from Muscat (and also from the Shaikhdoms in the Persian Gulf) are to be considered Persian subjects and Persian passports issued to them still stand.( 115 ) The position is that the Persians do not claim sovereignty over Muscat (nor the Shaikhdoms other than Bahrain), but have not recognised its form of government and have no relations with it.( 116 ) In 1936 the Persian authorities refused to issue a residence ( 110 ) I.O. to F.O.

Apart from the above, few matters affecting relations between Muscat and Persia have occurred during the period under review. In 1933 a protest regarding the visit of a Persian armed dhow to Khassab met with a categorical denial. In 1934 the Persian Passport Officer at Quetta paid a visit to Gwadur without notice, being apparently unaware that it was not covered by the permission he had received from the Baluchistan authorities to visit Mekran. A protest was made to the Persian Government against his visiting Gwadur without first obtaining a visa, and it was stated that the Sultan had taken courteous exception to it.( 117 ) In the same year a protest was lodged regarding the seizure by the Persians of a Muscat dhow. In 1937 the Persian Government complained informally that their subjects were smuggling arms from Muscat, but the information furnished was too vague to permit of adequate investigation. It appeared, however, that a trickle of arms was reaching Persia from Muscat, the smugglers all being Persian subjects.! ) id) India 71. There are about 500 Hindus resident in Muscat territory, excluding Gwadur, who have adopted Indian nationality and there is substantial trade between Muscat and India, Muscat being largely dependent upon India for a market for her dates. Since the transfer of power in 1947 the Sultan has treated India with great respect and showed anxiety to be on good terms with her As the Government of India were a party to the Commercial Treaty ot 1939, he regarded it as still applying to India after the transfer of power at any rate until that country became a republic when he expressed some doubts on the subject. 72 Early in 1949 the Government of India asked His Majesty's Government to seek the agreement of the Sultan under the Treaty of 1939 to the opening of an Indian Consulate in Muscat, and stated that it was ^ intention m the firs instance to appoint a non-career Vice-Consul or Con suU ) The Sultan d ^ object at first to the opening of a Consulate, but stated his preference for a career Vice-Consul and that he would not in any case accept the appointment of a local Hindu called Rai Bahadur Gokuldass who according to local rumour the Government of India were proposing to select. Later in the year when it became known that India was to become a republic the Sultan formed the opinion that it was no longer possible for an Indian Consul to be appointed under the 1939 Treaty and said that the matter must await the execution of a new treaty between Muscat and India ( 119 ) His Majesty's Government held that the change of status in India made no difference to her position under the Treaty and the Sultan was informed accordingly, but refused to change his attitude. 73 Towards the end of 1949 the Sultan stayed in India for about six weeks ( 121 ) He spent most of his time in Bombay where apparently he wasno altogether satisfied with the treatment accordea to him by the United Kmgdo Deoutv High Commissioner although he made no official complaint on w ako naid a visit to New Delhi where he had some official fTHZ S Uusc!t Thould' l^ a under^&lt;:en a when 0 the^l 939°^ feat^ made a ^ r , te 0 f limited jurisdiction over their nationals then hy His Majesty s Cons , 85 below ). when the Treaty had been signed conceded by the Sultan ^p g P shou | d be tended in respect of India, but SThisIhe Sultan would not agreed) Two frigates of the Indian Navy visited '''J 'Vht 5 Indian Ambassador at Tehrn^ .i S »e5 £ » March .5. 1953 b, ('') Teheran to F.O. ^of Augusm ^ 193g) ( IIS ) I.O. to F.O.

It is to run for five years from the date of ratification and after that is terminable on six months' notice by either party. It had not been ratified by the end of 1953.( 127 ) (e) Pakistan 75. The Sultan has always regarded Pakistan with suspicion, possibly because of her attitude towards Gwadur. He has also insisted on his relations with Pakistan being conducted through Her Majesty's Government on the ground that she is a Dominion although he has more than once been informed that this is no obstacle to direct relations. In 1949, however, he paid an official visit to Karachi, where he was well received. In the same year a ship of the Roval Pakistan Navy visited Muscat. 76. After partition the Sultan held that Pakistan was not a party to the 1939 Commercial Treaty and that if she wished to become one she must formally accede to it. The Pakistanis held different views but the matter was never put to the test. When negotiations were started for the new Treaty of 1951 the Pakistan Government stated that they did not wish to be party to it and that they would prefer to make their own arrangements. They accordingly proposed to send a delegation to the Sultan in November 1951 to discuss the lines on which a separate Treaty might be concluded. He refused to receive such a delegation but promised to consider proposals for a Treaty if they were submitted to him through His Majesty s Government. The Pakistan Government were notified accoidmgly and informed that His Majesty's Government were willing to act as the TubTct (''7 m the rnar ' ner P ro P osed but nothing further has been heard on 77. Reference has been made elsewhere to the Pakistan Government's desire to obtain possession of Gwadur (paragraph 47 above) and to the Pakistani Post ?ki if ( Pf ra f a .P h 100 below). In 1950 the Sultan granted permission ? f e ® tabl ' s h m ent of pilot balloon observatories by the Pakistan Government a Matrah and Gwadur.

In 1951 they asked that their nationals should be excluded from the arrangement whereby Her Majesty's Consul-General exercises a limited jurisdiction over nationals of Commonwealth countries (paragraph 85 below).

No reports have since been received of any American cargoes being landed in Muscat territorv but it seems unlikely that if they were, preferential treatment would be claimed for 80. In March 1934 the United States Minister at Bagdad, accredited as Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy on special mission naid a short visit in Mncrat to convey the felicitations of the President of the Unifed States toX Sutan on the occasion of the centenary of the Treaty between the United States and Mmrat In 1938 the Sultan paid an official visit to'the United States al his ow^estion (paragraph 66 above). No business of importance was discussed but it is interesting ( 126 ) P.R. to P.O. Despatch 43 of May 7, 1953 (EA 10385 12 of 1953&gt; ( 127 ) It was ratified in February 1954. .

Apart from these two matters the Sultan had few if any dealings with the United States before the Second World War. During the war he agreed to the use of the Salalah and Masirah airfields by the United States forces. 81. In 1946 he received a visit from the United States Consul at Dhahran who informed him orally that Muscat was in his consular area. This was a surprise to the Sultan who was under the impression that United States interests in Muscat were in charge of their Consul at Bombay. Since then United States Consular Officers and warships have paid comparatively frequent visits to Muscat. In 1946 the Sultan granted permission for United States civil aircraft to overfly Muscat territory after protesting because the first approach on the subject was made through the Political Agent. In 1952 he applied to the United States Consul- General at Dhahran for Point-IV Aid (paragraph 29 above) and asked him to find an American company to take over the Dhofar oil concession, and he subsequently granted an exploratory concession to an American company (paragraph 64 above). 82. Although the Sultan appears anxious to obtain any material aid he can from the Americans he has shown no sign yet of turning to them rather than to Her Majesty's Government for advice and assistance in political matters. (g) France 83. The French continued to keep their Consulate building in Muscat in renair until 1945 when they returned it to the Sultan.C' 1 ) They have made no attempt to intervene in Muscat affairs during the period under report though occasional visits have been made there by their Consular officers and warships In 1933 they agreed to an increase of the Muscat tariffs in spite of the provisions of the Treaty of 1844 (paragraph 15 above). 84 In 1946 the Muscat Government were informed officially that Muscat was under the Consular jurisdiction of the French Consul-General in Bombay, but the present position is uncertain. In 1951 the Foreign Office refused to take th initiative in clarifying it and held that it must be left to the French to ma ^ e first move^ ) In 1952 in talks at the Quai d'Orsay it appeared that the French were thinking of making their representative to the Yemen but nothing further has been heard on the subject.! ) In the same year me French Consul at Aden asked a Dr. Barthoux who was on a visit to Muscat to make enquiries about the French Consulate building and the land adjoining it which the cvSn^Vi haH nnrrhased in 1907.( 133 ) He gave him a letter on the subject addressed to Her Majesty's Consul, and this combined with the fact that the British Passport Officer at Aden had granted him a visa without consulting the Muscat Government so infuriated the Sultan that he refused to see Dr^ Barthoux or to reply to his enquiries beyond sending an oral message that the French Government must write to him officially about the Consulate building.

The Sultan, jealous as always of his independence and bearing in mind the changed status of India, gave notice of his desire to terminate the Commercial Treaty of 1939 as soon as it was permissible for him to do so, his chief object being the elimination of the article which conferred jurisdiction on His Majesty. This article was in fact omitted from the Treaty of 1951 but the Sultan was persuaded to exchange letters (Appendix C (i) and (ii)) agreeing that the British Consular authorities should continue to exercise full jurisdiction over {a) citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, {b) Southern Rhodesian citizens, and ic) British- protected persons, excluding Muslims in all classes, and that in respect of the nationals (including Muslims) of other Commonwealth countries, with certain specified exceptions, they should hear and decide cases, except those in which the complainant or plaintiff was the Sultan's Government or a national of the Sultan. The same exchange of letters provides for the automatic application of all the Sultan's laws and regulations to British nationals and for the deportation of any such national at the Sultan's personal request. In a separate letter the Political Resident informed the Sultan that the Governments of the Union of South Africa and of Pakistan had intimated that they did not wish that their nationals should come under the jurisdiction of the British Consular authorities under these arrangements. This gives rise to an anomalous situation especially in respect of Pakistanis, of whom there are a certain number resident in Muscat, as the Sultan has refused to take jurisdiction in cases in which British Commonwealth nationals are concerned and no Muscat interests are involved. 86. A new Order in Council is under preparation to give elfect to these changes, and meanwhile the Order in Council of 1949 is being administered subject to them. Their effect has been greatly to reduce the judicial work of Her Majesty's Consulate as the number of persons over whom full jurisdiction has been retained is very small. (b) Facilities for the Royal Navy 87. In 1935 the Sultan agreed in writing (Appendix D (i)) that the Royal Navy could construct small buildings on the northern end of Ghanam Island, and a mooring for an oil barge in Khor Quwai, the channel which separates the island from the Musandam Peninsula. Naval personnel were to be free to visit the whole of the island provided they did not interfere with the goats there but the buildings were to be restricted to a limited area. No flag was to be flown. During the War the naval buildings at Khor Quwai were extended and a wireless station was erected there. A flag was also flown. The Political Resident held that the Sultan s undertaking to give His Majesty's Government all the facilities they required during the War covered these developments and that no reference to the Sultan was necessary.( ') In 1945 Khor Quwai was made over to the Royal Air Force for air-sea rescue work with the Sultan's approval. In April 1946 all Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel were evacuated from Khor Quwai and the wireless apparatus was dismantled. The base was placed in charge of a caretaker and arrangements were made for one of His Majesty's ships to visit it at frequent intervals. At the end of 1946 the Sultan enquired to what extent Ghanam Island was being utilised. The Political Agent replied stating the Roval Navy's requirements and promising that no naval personnel would be stationed on the island, no additional buildings would be erected and the wireless station would not be brought in use without his pei mission (Appendix D (ii)). The Sultan accepted the proposals without making any further conditions (Appendix D (iii) and (iv)). 88. Under Article (6 (4) (c)) of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation of 1951( 134 ) the Royal Navy are permitted to import their requirements into Muscat territory free of customs duties, provided they conform with the customs formalities. No prior permission is required for Her Majesty's ships to visit Muscat territory but it is necessary to give the Sultan prior notice, ^. n . ( ^. . consult him before any visit is paid to a place which is not ordinarily visited, if it is intended to make any landings there. Naval parties are not allowed to move inland for shooting or other purposes without the Sultan's permission. p) No H VT C EXt ' 4515 ' Ext ' 4516 0f AU8USt 25 ' 1943 (E 5037 / 4420 /91 Of 1943). ■H ill199 . (c) facilities for the Royal Air Force 89. Before the Second World War the Sultan readily granted the Royal Air Force any facilities they asked for without consideration and permitted them to import their requirements free of customs duty. During this period the Royal Air Force constructed a number of airfields on the Batinah Coast and along the Southern Coast of Arabia within the Sultan's territory. An exchange of letters covering the grant of facilities took place shortly after the signing of the Civil Air Agreement in 1934. During the war all facilities required were granted as part of the consideration for the War Subsidy (paragraph 19 above). After the war the position was regularised by exchanges of letters (Appendix E (i) to (iv)) made at the time of the signing of the Civil Air Agreement of 1947 (paragraph 92 below). Under these the Royal Air Force are permitted to use and station personnel at the Salalah and Masirah airfields only. The subsidy of £6,000 payable under the Civil Air Agreement is held to cover all the facilities granted and the rent of the area occupied at the time it was signed. The grant of facilities is to cease when the present validity of the Civil Air Agreement expires, /.e., on April 5, 1954, unless the Sultan accords specific permission for its extension and then only on such conditions as may be determined by him. At the same time the Political Agent wrote two letters to the Sultan accepting Special Rules laid down by him for the conduct and security of personnel and passengers of air services and of the Royal Air Force at Salalah and Masirah and conveying a number of assurances (Appendix E (v) and (vi)). The rules cover such matters as movement after dark, the flying of flags, smoking in the town, shooting and the importation of alcohol. The assurances included amongst other things undertakings that on the expiry of the Civil Air Agreement or of any extension of it all permanent buildings at Salalah and Masirah would revert to the Sultan free of charge and that he would be supplied with 10,000 rounds of small-arms ammunition annually during its currency. The import free of duty of Royal Air Force requirements is covered by Article 6 (4) (c) of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.C 5 ) 90. Detachments of the Royal Air Force under the command of the Air Officer Commanding, Aden, are maintained at the two airfields coveied by the letters together with a detachment of the Aden Protectorate Levies at Masirah. Since 1947 the Royal Air Force have not sought facilities elsewhere in Muscat territory. (d) Civil Aviation 91. In 1929 the Sultan's permission was obtained for the construction of an aerodrome at Gwadur and its use by Imperial Airways, and he subsequently authorised its use by Dutch and French aircraft. Gwadur was also used foi a time as a landing-place for Imperial Airways flying boats. The position was not regularised until 1934 when a Civil Air Agreement was entered into with the Sultan whereby he granted His Majesty's Government exclusive rights to establish and maintain aerodromes in his territory as his agents. Under it his formal authorisa tion had to be obtained for any scheduled services and his agreement was required to the use of the aerodromes by aircraft other than British. A subsidy of £500 a vear was provided for in the Agreement, and this was paid with effect from 19^9. there appears to have been a private understanding that this sum was to cover the use of Gwadur and Shinas only and that if any other aerodromes were taken into use it would be increased. The amount was raised to £1,000 for 1935 owing to the increased use of Gwadur for aircraft landings. The Agreement was^ for four years onlv and it was not renewed when it expired in 1938 as the use of Gwadur had by then ceased except for emergency purposes. It was accompanied by Air Navigation Regulations which in 1936 were enforced against persons subject to His Majesty s jurisdiction by a King's Regulation.! ) 92 During the war the Royal Air Force established aerodromes at Salalah in Dhofar and on Masirah Island, and in 1946 the British Overseas Airways Corporation were making regular use of these^ Negotiations were accordingly starferi for a new Civil Air Agreement. At the beginning of 1947 the British Overseas Airways Corporation abandoned the use of these aerodromes, but it was decided to continue the negotiations and t0 / ee Pf f Q , a F.?d ro mes open or civil aviation.( 137 ) The agreement was signed on April 5, 1947.( ) It repeats the I ( 135 ) No. 11 V, T.C.

The last of these was included because at the time of the signing of the agreement the British Overseas Airways Corpora tion were maintaining mooring buoys there for emergency landings by flying boats. These have since been removed. The agreement is renewable at the option of Her Majesty's Government and with the concurrence of the Sultan at the conclusion of seven years, i.e., in 1954.( 139 ) The amount of subsidy payable is £6.000 a year and the Article providing for this was subject to revision after three years, i.e., in 1950. The Sultan has not, however, asked for its revision. In 1951 His Majesty's Government considered the possibility of reducing the amount but the Political Resident advised against it.( 140 ) The agreement was accompanied by a new set of Air Navigation Regulations, which have not yet been enforced against persons subjects to Her Majesty 's jurisdiction, and by a list of General Conditions laid down by the Sultan to govern the use of aerodromes within his territory. The Political Agent also wrote to the Sultan agreeing to Special Rules laid down by him and conveying a number of assurances (Appendix E (v) and (vi)). These affect the Royal Air Force more than civil aviation personnel and passengers (paragraph 89 above). A copy of the Civil Air Agreement with the Air Navigation Regulations and list of General Conditions but not the other documents accom panying it was registered with the International Civil Aviation Organisation( 141 ) without the consent of the Sultan, who would probably prefer to treat the agreement as confidential. 93. The agreement has worked satisfactorily. Authority to permit the use of the Salalah and Masirah aerodromes by civil aircraft has been delegated to the Air Officer Commanding, Aden. Up to date no request for an authorisation for a scheduled service to use these aerodromes has been passed on to the Sultan and it is not known what fees he proposes to charge for such use. In 1949 he stated his intention of charging a fee of £5 a year for each aircraft over-flying Muscat territory on a scheduled service. It was pointed out to him that it was not customary to charge fees for the mere privilege of over-flying( 142 ), and though he would not commit himself when he granted an authorisation to Quantas Airways in 1951 to over-fly his territory he did not in fact make any charge.! 143 ) In 1947 the Sultan with much reluctance permitted French military aircraft to land at Salalah and Masirah as a special case on the understanding that this permission would not be regarded as a precedent.! 144 ) There was some friction with the Sultan in 1948 owing to the failure of the Royal Air Force to pay to him the customs duty due on fuel supplied by them to civil aircraft at the rate of 2 annas a gallon, efforts which had been made during the negotiations for the Agreement to persuade him to exempt such fuel from duty having failed. The payment of all arrears was eventually made and the arrangement has worked smoothly since. In 1951 the Sultan, while he was at Muscat, was asked to agree to an exchange of letters to ensure that the flying approaches at Salalah and Masirah were kept clear of buildings. He refused to accept the proposal until he had himself visited Salalah. As it was considered unlikely that any buildings would in fact be erected, the matter was dropped.! 145 ) 94. The only airfield in Muscat territory not covered by the agreement of which use is ordinarily made by civil aircraft is that at Muscat itself. It is small and surrounded by hills and can only be used by the smaller types of modern aircraft. Hitherto the Sultan has only permitted its use on special occasions by- aircraft carrying passengers to or from Muscat on His or Her Majesty's Government's business. Towards the end of 1953 however he gave permission to the Gulf Aviation Company at Bahrain to establish a regular service between Bahrain and Muscat upon terms to be agreed after an experimental period of three months. Owing to the expense involved in improving the runway it was not certain by the end of 1953 whether the Company would pursue the project. ( 138 ) I.O. to F.O. Ext. 928/47 of May 6, 1947 (W 3412/16/802 of 1947).

Although no reports appear to exist on the subject it may be presumed that domestic slavery is widespread in Muscat and that it is regarded as a lawful institution. The Sultan has however honourably observed the provisions of the Treaty of 1873( 146 ) and when called upon to do so takes such action as is in his power to prevent the traffic in slaves, which is totally prohibited by proclamations issued by Saiyid Turki in 1873 and 1884 (Appendix F (i) and (ii)). He has also raised no objection to the exercise by Her Majesty's Consul-General of the power to manumit. Between 1928 and 1945 manumissions averaged 29 a year. 96. When a Political Officer visited Buraimi in 1938 with the oil company s representatives (paragraph 41 above) he reported that about 1,000 slaves were sold in the Hamasah market every year for export to Saudi Arabia and that they were mostly abducted from Persia via the Batinah coast. In 1942 the Political Resident reported that this traffic was still continuing and that the Sultan was powerless to stop it.( 147 ) The market at Hamasah was still operating after the war and was then mostly supplied with persons abducted from the Batinah Coast itself or from the Trucial Coast (Chapter 3, paragraph 138). With the gradual consolidation of the Sultan's authority on the Batinah and with the establishment of the Trucial Oman Levies the traffic'has dwindled to very small proportions in recent years. Sif if) Arms 97. The question of the arms traffic from Muscat which assumed such importance in the first two decades of the century( 14S ) is no longer the cause of any anxiety. When the arms subsidy ceased in 1936, the Political Resident expressed the opinion that the Sultan was no longer bound by Saiyid Faisal's engagement ol 1912 because the arms subsidy which formed the consideration tor it had been withdrawn, nor by Saiyid Taimur's adherence to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919( 149 ) because that Convention had been replaced by another one m t0 whi^h Muscat had not adhered and which had not even been nought into operation^ 150 ) The present Sultan however has never specifically repudiated these undertakings nor has he withdrawn the proclamations issued by Faisal in 1898 forbidding the export of arms and ammunition to India and Persia and giving British and Persian vessels the right to search Muscat vessels for these artic es (Appendix G (i) and (ii)). Faisal's engagement of 1912 was not embodied in a formal agreement. In return for a subsidy and on certain other conditions he issued a notification (Appendix G (iii)) in which all arms and ammunition held at the time bv arms dealers or subsequently imported were to be deposited. The correspondence on the subject is summarised in a memorandum entitled Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf ' prepared by the Political Department of the India Office and dated February 20, 1913.( 151 ) 1 i m ¥ (g) Banks 98 After the Second World War His Majesty's Government endeavoured to persuade a British Bank to open a Branch at Muscat. In 1946 they succeeded m interesting the Imperial Bank of Iran in the proposal and in persuading the Su tan to grant that Bank an option. This option was not taken up and the Eastern Bank entered the field. In 1948 the Imperial Bank of Iran changed their minds and for a time it appeared that the two Banks would compete for a concession from the Sultan. The Eastern Bank however delayed taking action, and in July 1948 an agreement (Appendix H) was signed between the Sultan of Muscat and the Imperial Bank of Iran (now the British Bank of the Middle East) for a period of twenty years, during which the Bank is to have a monopoly. It opened a branch in Muscat in September of the same year, since when the agreement has worked satisfactorily In 1953 the Bank were negotiating with the Sultan for land for the new premises which under the agreement they are bound to build.

Until the transfer of power in 1947 the Government of India maintained a post office in Muscat and a post and telegraph office in Gwadur, unsurcharged Indian stamps being used in both. In 1944 at the Sultan's suggestion they introduced a special set of surcharged stamps to commemorate the bicentenary of the Al bu Sa'id dynasty. On the transfer of power the Pakistan Government took over both post offices. On April 1, 1948, the General Post Office, London, took over the Muscat post office and brought into use British stamps surcharged with rupee values only as the Sultan objected to a surcharge of ' Muscat'T 52 ) In 1953 the Sultan expressed a desire to introduce his own stamps without giving any indication that he wished to take over the administration of the post office. 100. It was not found possible to make arrangements for the Gwadur post and telegraph office to be taken over on April 1, 1948, and the Pakistan Government were asked to continue to run it for the time being. Later when the Sultan desired that this arrangement should be terminated both for political reasons and because of the inefficient manner in which the office was being run, the Pakistan Government demurred and it was considered undesirable to press them for fear of accentuating the controversy over the retrocession of GwadurU 153 ) They still continue to run the office using unsurcharged Pakistan stamps and insisting on payment being made in Pakistan currency although the only local currency recognised by the Muscat Government is the Indian rupee. They have recently introduced a wireless station to supplement a land-line which is rarely in working order and have taken steps to improve the postal services, about which there had been many complaints. (/) Telecommunications 101. In 1937 after Messrs. Cable and Wireless Ltd. had taken over the cable station at Muscat from the Indo-European Telegraph Department the Sultan asked for payment for the telegraph facilities they enjoyed. It was generally agreed that although under the agreements of 1864 and 1865( 154 ) His Majesty's Government had used the facilities free of charge, now that a commercial company had taken over the Sultan was entitled to charge rent, but he was urged to make it a purely nominal one. He accordingly granted a licence (Appendix I (i)) to the company in 1939 valid until 1987 on payment of a yearly rent of £1 for each cable landed. At the same time he gave permission to the company to instal an emergency wireless set. 102. In 1950 he entered into an agreement with the company for the installation of a telephone service at Muscat. Its terms are briefly as follows: — {a) The Company has exclusive permission to instal and maintain the telephone service between Muscat and Muttrah, commencing on the 1st January, 1950, and expiring on 31st December, 1987. (b) The Company shall provide and maintain six free telephone lines including one for the Sultan's Palace. (c) The Company will undertake to train and employ suitable subjects of the Sultan for operating the telephone system as far as is possible and will afford reasonable facilities for two Sultanate employees to study the installation, operation and maintenance of the telephone system.( J65 ) 103. In 1951 after prolonged negotiations the Sultan granted the company a Wireless Telephone and Wireless Telegraph Licence (Appendix I (ii)). The licence is valid until 1987 and no rental is payable but the Sultan is guaranteed certain services free of charge. At the time of the granting of the licence the Company's representative wrote a letter to the Sultan amplifying the provisions of some of its Articles (Appendix I (iii)). (/) Quarantine and Medical 104. Although Her Majesty's Government are not internationally responsible for quarantine at Muscat, the Medical Officer appointed by them to hold charge of the Muscat Charitable Hospital acts as Quarantine Medical Officer on behalf ( 152 ) C.R.O. to P.O.

He pays an allowance of Rs. 150 - a month to the Quarantine Medical Officer. 105. The Sultan has not adhered to the International Sanitary Convention of 1926 but has agreed to follow generally the recently issued International Sanitary Regulations with certain reservations. In 1952 the World Health Organisation proposed to write to him asking him to consider the apphcation of these Regulations to Muscat but it is not known what transpired.( ) In U45 ne raised objections to the issue of International Health Certificates by the Medical Officer in charge of the hospital but the practice was persisted in. 106. The Muscat Charitable Hospital which until a few ^ years ago was known as either the Agency or the Consulate Hospital was built about 1 J; Sultan Saiyid Faisal donated the land, the Government of India contributed Rs 0 0 000 and a sum of Rs. 40,000 was obtained by subscriptions from merchants Faisal publicly laid the foundation stone. ^Subsequently ^ the Government of India paid the staff and supplied medicines while the cost oi the Smtenance of the building and ot any improvements was ^t Irom public subscrbtions and a contribution of Rs. 1,200/- a year from the Sultan The hospita?fund was about Rs. 20,000 in credit when His Majesty s Government took over responsibility for the Persian Gulf Residency j ^ wh 107 Since then Her Majesty's Government have always desired to be treed from anv fin^c af commitmint in respect of this hospital but have continued trom any nnancidi cumum. ^ CnUan was nersuaded to increase his preparing some plans has done nothing in this f he bu ii din g Health Officer.

The Indian Rupee is the currency in general use in the ports of Muscat and Matrah and in Gwadur territory but elsewhere the Maria Theresa dollar is preferred and in the interior and in Dhofar nothing else is accepted. The Pakistan Rupee is ordinarily only accepted by the Pakistan Post Office at Gwadur. The Maria Theresa dollar is a silver coin minted commercially as opportunity offers. Its value vis-a-vis the Indian rupee fluctuates greatly. At the beginning of the last war it was for a time worth less than one Indian Rupee; according to the latest reports it is now worth about three-and-a-half. The Sultan was once reported to be accumulating as many of these dollars as possible in his Treasury with a view to making them so scarce that the tribes of the interior would be forced to accept the Indian Rupee. It was also reported at the time that large quantities of dollars were being exported from Sultanate territory for their silver content. 111. There is a subsidiary coin known as the baiza in which the retail prices of local food-stulfs and other produce are usually fixed. Its value varies vis-a-vis^ both the rupee and the dollar. In 1948 the Sultan had his own nickel baiza coinage minted and issued a communique (Appendix J) fixing the baiza rate at 200 to the Maria Theresa dollar and 100 to the Indian rupee. He proposed to issue further communiques varying the rate vis-a-vis the rupee to accord with changes in the rate between the rupee and the Maria Theresa dollar but so far as is known has never done so. At the end of 1950 the baiza rate vis-a-vis the rupee was reported to be 64 at Muscat and 48 at Matrah. (m) Protocol and Consular Privileges 112. The Political Resident and Her Majesty's Consul-General call first on the Sultan or the person appointed to represent him during his absences. If the call is made officially in uniform it is always returned at Her Majesty's Consulate; otherwise it is often returned as a matter of courtesy, but not of obligation, unless the call is a private one to discuss business. It is customary for the Consul-General to pay formal calls on the Sultan or his representative on the two 'Ids, and for the Sultan or his representative to pay similar calls on the Consul-General on New Years' Day and Her Majesty's Birthday, which in the Persian Gulf is celebrated on April 21. On the latter occasion the shore batteries fire a royal salute. These calls are not returned. Her Majesty's ships salute the country on arrival at Muscat and the salute is returned by the shore batteries. Commanding Officers call formally on the Sultan or his representative and the call is usually returned in person on board and invariably so if the Commanding Officer is of or above the rank of Captain. Elsewhere in the Sultanate the Walis call first upon the Political Resident and Consular or other visiting officers call first upon the Walis. 113. In 1938 the Sultan agreed in writing to exempt from Customs dues, goods imported for the specific use of His Majestys Consulate and the personal use of His Majesty's Consul (Appendix K (i)). In 1948 he issued a decree prohibiting the import of all kinds of alcoholic liquor. At the same time he agreed orally to make a special exemption in favour of His Majesty's Consulate, and to allow a reasonable supply of liquor to Europeans and Anglo-Indians under a permit system for which His Majesty's Consulate would be responsible.( 160 ) He refused to grant a similar concession to the Hindus. His oral undertaking is referred to in a letter which he wrote at the time of the signing of the 1951 Treaty (Appendix K (ii)). In that letter he confirmed the privileges granted in 1938, and agreed that the term ' Consul ' used in his letter of that year should be read as including Consul-General, Consul, Vice-Consul and Consular Agent, {n) Lighterage at Muscat 114. The firm of Haji Bhacker has for many years held a contract for all lighterage at Muscat harbour. Its methods were antiquated and inefficient and at the instance of Messrs, Gray Mackenzie and Co. the Sultan has on several occasions been pressed to allow the latter firm to make their own arrangements for lighterage in respect of ships for which they are acting as agents, but has refused to do so .r 1 ) The firm of Haji Bhacker has recently imported a motor tug and improved its methods and Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Co. have for the time being ceased to complain. ( 159 ) P.R. to P.O. Despatch 1 of January 4, 1949 (E 752/1117/91 of 1949). ( 160 ) P.R. to P.O.
