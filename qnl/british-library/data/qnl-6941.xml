I have dieeuseed thie point with a piod •»ny MeaopotJwiwi offioera, nad ha*e jwnerally found thai opposed to anything of the kind. Dut so far a» I know, the -Aaleaale exclueion of Indi««»hna never Wen plated; and I apprehend that the terms of aur for Meoopotmia - if and when we «ei one - are likely to render such exclusion wholly iapraoUcable. . • 6. la the olrouBMtsaoes I venture with all respect to question the expediency, at the present juncture, of a declaration to the Office and ¥ar Office on the lines of the Secretary of States Minute. The future of Mesopotaisia is still uncertain. Very difficult and delicate problewa are before us* upon the soluAica of which will depend, in sosm tteasure, the whole future of British influence and authority in the East. The question is one in which India nwst, io any eventual ity, have a Material interest. It is scarcely oon- ceivable that, with her fleoaraphical advanta^ee and past connections with Iraq, she will fail to seoore her share of the benefite that will accrue froa the eetabiishment of settled ''OTemaent la «n arva of such enormous economic potential ities. India Mar or aear not have eauee for conplaint against the Hesopoteaian policy of Sis Uajeety's ■'rovsrnment; but I cannot see what she has te nin by idoptinp- en attitude of Si*m.or deolininr to take any further part in the groat work. She nay eiabarrass His llajssty*sI k OoTernmerit by to doins; bat how will she benefit herself? Above all, the present ssoment eeenft to m inopportune for it&amp;im the line ana*Re«t«4. We ere pasting throupji a period of transition. The emy of occupation is bein^ rapidly deiaobili.-sed, and the «reate«t difficulty is being eiperieneed in re- staffing the rariouii quaai-oifil senrieee for'whioh it has hitherto tuppliod toe personnel. 'fhe looal adsinistration is at it* witaV end to find ass and to preTeiit toe breakdown of essential \ senrioes. I venture to urge that we should, at any rate, wait until the position is to sots* extent restored, before announoinp an intention of oloeiiw the Indian source of supply, | . * 7, As regards toe question of JOMt* i* 'V ■ perhaps be mentioned that, before the*»r, to* Indian &lt;trtsy furnished garrisons for various plaoes aver whioh the (JovonusaBt of India exercised no adalaistrative control, e.g. Ceylon, the Straits Sottlwseata, Kauritius (prior to 1910), SMaliland, Hang Kong and horthom China. -</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000325_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B331</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000325</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B331</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Note on Indian Immigration into Mesopotamia</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1919/1919</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-07T11:48:35</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (5 folios)</extent><extent>The foliation for this memorandum commences at folio 74, and terminates at folio 78, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
