The letter includes a translation of a report (folio 352) sent to Kemball by the British Agent at Sharjah, Hajee Yacoob, dated 26 June 1853, with reports that a number of boats carrying slaves had landed at ports on the Arab coast, including Rusul Khymah [Ra's al-Khaymah], Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi] and Amulgavine [Umm al-Qaywayn], carrying an estimated total of 424 slaves. Appended to Yacoob's report is the translation of a letter (folio 352v) sent by the Imam of Muscat to Yacoob, dated 3 March 1853, in which the Imam reports of numerous vessels belonging to the 'tribes of the north' being involved in the slave trade who, he states, he had warned to no avail, about exporting slaves.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051555.0x00005c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
