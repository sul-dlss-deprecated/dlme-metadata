Calcutta^ the 27th January 1910. My Lord, We have the honour to reply to your despatch No. 28 (Secret), dated the 26th November 1909, and to place the following facts before your Lordship, in connection with the grant of R20,000 initial and R900 a year recurring made by us towards the construction and purchase of equipment for the hospital at Maskat. 2. Prior to June 1873 the patients at Maskat had to attend for treatment at the Agency Surgeon’s private house. This practice was, however, found to be inconvenient and we authorised the rental of a separate house for the dispensary ; but the sanction so accorded was not acted on as His Highness the Sultan shortly afterwards offered a house in the town, free of charge, for the purpose. The offer was accepted and the house continued to be so occupied until April 1907 when it was dismantled owing to the fact that it was unsafe. The dispensary was then moved first to the Hospital Assistant’s house and later to the Government quarters belonging to the consular Dragoman and the Postmaster. 3. The Agency Surgeon at Maskat reported that this new arrangement was in every way unsatisfactory ; the quarters are small, dirty and insanitary, and the work of the hospital was carried on with the greatest difficulty. At the same time the demands for medical assistance showed a continuous increase ; there was a total attendance of some 1,800 (old and new) patients each month and the small number of beds available for in-door patients were constantly filled. European patients had to be accommodated in the house of the Agency Surgeon. The political authorities in consequence proposed to construct a new building and to meet the cost involved partly by contributions from His Highness the Sultan and the public at Maskat, and partly from a contribution from Government. In their application for the latter they based their claim on the following grounds : — (a) If the proposed hospital were not built Government would be committed to an expenditure of at least R 20,000 for quarters for' 2 the Postmaster and Munshi, in whose quarters the present hospital is located. (b) the building of a hospital would produce important political results, as it would practically close the door against any Foreign Power that might desire to establish a hospital at Maskat or Matrah, and would strengthen our influence at Maskat. 4. Since it was clear that even if the hospital were maintained in its present unsatisfactory position we should have to incur some considerable expense in providing quarters for the Postmaster and Munshi, we considered a grant of R20,000 towards the building of the hospital to be justifiable and we accordingly sanctioned it on the conditions specified in our Foreign Secretary’s letter of the 13th September 1909 to the address of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office. 5. We would add, in conclusion, that we did not regard in the circumstances the grant strictly in the light of a charitable contribution though (as noted by your Lordship) had the expenditure been incurred in India it would have been covered by the terms of the Resolution enclosed with your financial despatch No. 98 of 14th August 1908 in regard to such contributions. We note, however, for our future guidance, your ruling that the authority to make such grants is limited to expenditure in India itself. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble Servants, (Signed) MINTO. „ O’MOORE CREAGH. „ J. O. MILLER. „ W. L. HARVEY.Copy. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FINANCE DEPARTMENT.

To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Loud, My attention has been called to the letter from your Secretary in the Foreign Department, dated Grant by Government of India towards the cost of construction, and 'purchase of equipment, for the Muscat Hospital. 13th September last, from which it appears that Your Excellency’s Government have made a grant of Rs. 20,000 initial, and Rs. 900 a year recurring, towards the construc tion of the building, and the purchase of equipment, for the Muscat Hospital. 2. Under paragraph III., 1 (a), of the draft Resolution enclosed in my Financial Despatch No. 98, dated 14th August 1908, I reserved my sanction to expenditure of an unusual nature except in cases where authority was granted by that Resolution. It has, perhaps, been argued that the present case is covered by paragraph III. (9), which authorises grants not exceeding Rs. 10,000 a year recurring, or Rs. 50,000 non-recurring, to charitable institutions. If so, it is important to bear in mind that the power to make such grants was not intended to be exercised outside India. I desire to be informed whether the grant under consideration was made as coming under the portion of the Resolution to which I have referred, and, if not, under what powers it was made. 1 have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn.Simifl 'iie /3 Cepteubor 1GOO.

There have been several cases which though properly hospital cases, have hexl to be treated or} board owing to the absence of any hospital accommodation for Europeans in the Gulf. The hospital at Bushire will not take Beri-beri cases - natives or Europeans. A case may have to wait a week before there is an opportunity for passage to Bombay. Two men sent to Bombay for surgical treatment returned seriously infected with malaria and were subsequently invalided home. Mi scat in the hot weather is more suitable for a hospital than any other place in the Gulf. The climate though hotter is less unhealthy than Bombay. (Sgd) S. Litchfield Commander H.M.S.

Agency Surgeon, on the subject of the need for the erection of a proper Hospital building in Muscat, 2. - The defects of the present building are well known to you and I need add nothing on this point to what is said in Captain Scott f s letter. I have approached the Sultan with regard to the idea and he has been pleased to take it up warmly and to announce his intention of calling a public meeting for the purpose of collecting subscriptions. I enclose copy of a notice which is being circulated to British subjects about the meeting and &lt;hicb. explains the line of action that we propose to take. 3. - The sum of money required, Rs.40,000, for the building alone apart from equipment is very great, andwe shall, no doubt, have difficulty in raising it even with the assistance of whatever contribution the Government of India may be willing to give. I am therefore endeavouring to tap every possible source of subscriptions and I write bo ask whether you think there is any chance that the Admiralty would give either a donation towards the new building or a yearly subscription or both in view of the advantage which it will be to the Royal Navy Ships station^ in these waters, to have a proper hospital available f&lt;i the treatment of the sick. The plan for the Hospital includes a European ward containing at least two beds and a yearly subscription G.Bird R.N, from . Persian Gulf Division, H.M.S.

If a proper ward had been available for the two sailors from H.M.S. ''Perseus” who were sick here a short while ago I do not think that their attacks of fever would have been so severe, or that the results, in one of the cases at least, would have been so serious. I shall be most grateful for any assistance that you can secure for our scheme. I have etc... (Sgd) R.H.Holland Political Agent and H.B.M's Consul MUSCATCopy /-n From, Captain Norman Scott I.M.S. Agency Surgeon, Muscat. To, R.E.Holland, Esq., I.C.S. Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. Sir, AGENCY HOSPITAL Muscat the 28th December 1908. Plea for the I have the honour to invite your attention to the urgent need^of a moaernly built conditions under v/hich the work of the Agency Dispensary has and equipped Hospital at been and is being carried on. Muscat. 2. - I venture to suggest you the emphatic need there is for a new Hospital building to allow of the modern treatment of disease under suitable hygienic conditions, such as would serve to impress the people of Muscat vi.t 1 . respect for Western Surgery and Medicine. I took over charge of the Muscat Dispensary in December 1906. At that time work was being carried on in a,n old Arab house lent to the Government by Sir Saiyid Faisal, G.C.I.E., Sultan of Muscat and Oman. This house was in a filthy and insanitary condition and to make matters worse was totally unsafe for habitation owing to its dilapidated condition which in itself constituted a public danger. 3. - In April 1907 the room used as a Dispensary fell down with a deafening crash. Happily this occurred at 3.30 p.m. when no patients were present, a serious acci dent being thereby avoided. Fortunately Mr. Harrison of the Public Works Department was present in Muscat' and condemned the remainder of the building as dangerous and uninhabitableuninhabitable. M$uor Grey, the Political Agent at that time, transferred the v/ork of the Dispensary to the Hospital Assistant's quarter (which is British propeity). This is a very small and very old house totally unsuited for use as a Dispensary several of the rooms of which are also in a dangerous state and cannot be used. This step lost the professional n ork of the Hospital a great deal of prestige compelling me as it did to refuse admission to any indoor patients and only permitting me to see,, treat and have the outpatients dressed in a small and ill suited room, where it was quite impossible to do them justice. The entrance to the building being by steep ladder, precluded the attendance of any women and made its access difficult to everybody more especially to the sick. During this period I was forced to refuse operation to several patients suffering from stone in the bladder. 4.- In August 1907 a small boy while fishing in his boat in the harbour was speared right through his thigh and into his abdomen by a large swordfish. This necessi tated an immediate operation which was done under the most difficult and unfavourable conditions. Fortunately the boy survived and had by force of circumstances to be accommodated in the Hospital Assistant's quarters. This proved to be the last straw in regard to the Hospital Assistant's forbearance for in.October 1907 he (a Hindu) addressed me a very strongly worded complaint in regard to the great unpleasantness and hardships, in addition to the bad climate of Muscat, he had to sustain by having a totally inadequate quarter left for his use. He added that even what remained was rendered public by thethe eonstmt presence of patients and unwholesome owing to the adjacency of the dressing table. I presented this document to Major Grey heartily endorsing the truth of the facts stated. Major Grey then transferred (October 1907) the Dispensary to the Government quarters inhabited by the Consular Dragoman and Postmaster finding accommo dation for them elsewhere. This, although the house is also an old Arab one, was a slight step for the better permitting as it does a possibility of admitting some 12 indoor patients and providing one adequate room for use as a pharmacy. However as youjare personally aware, I have demonstrated to you the dirty and insanitary condition of the entire basement necessitating all the rooms being barricaded up. The quarter for the compounder is totally inadequate consisting of one small room. There are only two good rooms fit for use as wards, the other rooms simply consisting of screened verandahs. My Office and consul tation room is situated in a verandah. The only room available for surgical operations leads to the rest of the building by narrow and tortuous passages which do not permit of the use of a stretcher. This renders the transfer of patients to be operated on from the wards to the operating room extremely difficult. The operating room has also to be used as a reception room for women, and it has once had to be requisitioned for the use of a European sailor off a British man-of-war who was suffering from Appendicitis. 5.- There are also no quarters for our Hospital servants or even for a sweeper, although that difficulty could be got over by repairing the basement. Patients therefore have no one but an old watchman to attend to them during the night. The conservancy of the Hospital is carried ont © carried on under the greatest difficulties. Besides the site of the present house is in my opinion unsuitable, adjoining as it does the Sepoys' Quarters, and being so near to the high rocks. The construction of the building is entirely faulty for use as a Hospital and very large sums of money ^ould have to be spent to render it at all suitable. In regard to the work done at the Dispensary about 500 new patients apply for treatment on an average during each month and there is a total attendance ofsome 1800 (old and new) cases a month. Since the Hospital has been in the present quarters, a matter of some 14 months, the rooms available as wards have been constantly filled, there being 8 to 12 indoor patients always under treatment suffering from widely varying diseases medical and surgical. Had there been more and better accommodation to offer especially for women many more of the inhabitants would have sought relief as indoor patients. This year since the wards have been available 150 indoor patients have been treated as against 54 in the preceding year. The annual attend ance of new outdoor cases is 6180 this year in place of 5190 last year, an increase of 1000 and being 340 in advance of any previous year. 6.- Finally you asked ibe to place the fact on record that I have been compelled at different times, owing to the insanitary and unsuitable state of the Hospital, to treat several patients in my own house and to use my verandah as an operating theatre. The following is a list of these cases. (1) J.W. Gumming Esq. (2) Do. (3) French sailor from R.F. 11 Javelin e'. Blaekwater Fever. Severe Bronchitis. Abscess of the thigh, (operated on) (4)@ (4) B.I.Ship, Engineer (5) Arab woman. Abscess (operated on) Amputation of breast. Additionally as you are aware a sailor (suffering from appendicitis) from the British man-of-war ’’Perseus' was treated first of all in your house and subsequently in the operating room of the Hospital. At the time of writing this, an officer of the Indian Army has had to be landed from the British India Mail suffering from what may turn out to be Enteric fever, and has been accommodated at the Consulate. These facts plead eloquently the urgent need there is for a properly equipped ward for Europeans in the proposed new Hospital, if one did exist it has been suggested the Admiralty might be willing to bear some of the cost as frequently the Senior Naval Officer would be glad to be abl° to land sailors for treatment. 7.- In regard to the Hospital fittings, furniture, and instruments they are with the exception of a modern eye case and a lithotrite case, absolutely only fit to be condemned. They are old antiquated septic instruments impossible of sterilisation without destruction, and of ancient cumbersome patterns. The beds are old dirty charpoys mostly falling to bits and the whole tout ensemble is amply sufficient to dishearten any one. I have, etc.... (Sgd) Norman Scott, Capt. I.M.S. Agency Surgeon . MUSCATTHE MUSCAT HOSPITAL. Until two years ago, the Muscat Hospital T *as carried on in an old Arab house kindly lent for the purpose by H.H. the Sultan. Thd building became unsafe in April 1907, and had to be pulled down. The Hospital was moved at first to the Hospital Assistant's house and then to the Goverbment quarters belonging to the Consular Dragoman and Postmaster. The Hospital is still located in these quarters, but the arrangement can only be a temporary one, since in the first place the house is for various reasons unsuitable^,s a Hospital and in the second place the quarters will soon be needed again for the Dragoman and Postmaster. In order therefore that the important and useful medical work done in Muscat may not come to a standstill it is most necessary that a special building should be erected for the Hospital The idea was brought to the notice of the Sultan and His Highness has been graciously pleased not only to favour the scheme warmly but to announce his intention of initiating personally the necessary measures for its development. The piece of land on which the old Hospital stood before it fell down; has with the consent of His Highness been granted by the owners free of charge for the erection of a Hospital and negotiations have^Gegun for the acquisi tion of two other pieces of land which are also required at the back of the firbt piece. This is a good beginning, but it is, as it were, only the first step in a long journey, since the building will cost Rs.40,000 according to the rough estimate that has been made, and it cannot be b-gun until it is known how much money will be available. His Highness the Sultan/ has ordered that a subscription list should be opened under his own patronage for the Hospital and I therefore write this letter to all British subjects in Muscat to ask them to subscribe generously to this list. Most persons living in Muscat or Mutrah owe a debt of gratitude to the Hospital for help which they have received from it in times of sickness. For this reason it is their duty to give. But besides this every man whatever his religion or caste may be, will earn merit by giving freely according to his means, since to provide for the relief of suffering and the cure of disease is the highest and best form of charity. Whatever money is given will certainly be spent without waste and in the best and most economical way for the benefit of the sick. His Highness has intimated his intention of holding a public meeting for the purpose of discussing the question at the Sultan's Palace on 6th February 1909 at 9 a.nu I understand that one question for discussion will be whether the names of subscribers or a fixed sum and upwards should be commemorated by an inscription to be placed on the wall within the Hospital. It is my earnest hope that all British subjects will join with me in attending this meeting, and that they will give liberal subscriptions so that the Hospital may be well built and that, it may be usefil, for many generations to come, both to Arab and British subjects in Muscat.
