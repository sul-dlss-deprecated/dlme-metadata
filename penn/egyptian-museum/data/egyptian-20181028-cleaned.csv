The block originally belonged to the pylon gateway of a royal ""sunshade"" or solar chapel dedicated to the worship of the Aten. This building was ornately decorated with inlaid faience, now missing, composing the figures of Akhenaten and Meretaten, as well as most other parts of the decoration. The sunshade chapel was a relatively small, probably single-chamber, building that would have originally stood on a raised podium inside of a larger building.The inscriptions state this building to have been located "" in Akhetaten"" - the capital city of Tell el-Amarna. This piece was part of what was once a larger block that included the door frame and lintel of the left side of the chapel pylon. It was cut down during the reign of Merenptah (Dynasty 19 ) when the block was  reused as a plinth for a sphinx. Inscriptions on the edges of the block have the titulary of Merenptah and the epithet:""beloved of Ra-Horakhty in Heliopolis"". The reused  block must have stood in a temple at Heliopolis. It was reused a third time as a door threshold in Medieval Cairo. It was recovered from the Mousky area of Cairo in 1899 by the Egyptian Service des Antiquites and sold to Mr. Jones Wister of Germantown, Philadelphia.",,,,king|sun|Aten,231.9,,66.0,,,cm,31-60-1,http://www.penn.museum/collections/object/35223,https://upmaa-pennmuseum.netdna-ssl.com/collections/assets/

It was excavated in the area of the  sacred enclosure of the temple of the god Ptah at Memphis, Egypt. The sphinx, a lion with a human head, represents the power of the Egyptian king, both to protect his people and to conquer the enemies of Egypt. This statue was buried up to its shoulders; only the exposed head was attacked by windblown sand, which eroded the facial features and the royal false beard. The inscriptions on the chest and around the base give the five names of Ramses II. His son and successor, Merenptah, added his own cartouches to the shoulders after his father's death. This sphinx, the the largest in the Western hemisphere, was quarried at Aswan and transported by river to the Ptah Temple at Memphis, 600 miles away. While it has never been placed on a scale, it is estimated to weigh just under 13 tons.",,,,Sphinx,,362.0,145.0,,,cm,,http://www.penn.museum/collections/object/118724,https://upmaa-pennmuseum.netdna-ssl.com/collections/assets/
