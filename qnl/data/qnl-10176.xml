The emphasis in the papers is on the various ways through which the gold is sourced around the world, particularly other parts of the Middle East, such as the Levant. This is in contrast to previous periods when concern with gold smuggling primarily focused on Indian sources of contraband gold. The correspondence is primarily between the Political Agency in Kuwait, the Political Residency in Bahrain, and the Government of Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Gold trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000161#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000161#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000161#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000161#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
