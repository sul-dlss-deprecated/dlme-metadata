He relates his familyâ€™s background including tribe and noteworthy ancestors, and recollects the nature of the community before the relocation from Qurna. In doing so Abdelbaset describes traditions of the village, such as myths and festive occasions like weddings. His work as an artist, for a living and as a hobby, is also discussed, including his painting of the facades of houses in Old Qurna (for which they were famous), and how his mother and other relatives often assisted him.  He gives his account of the relocation of residents from Qurna, including past resettlements, the relocations that began in 2006, and what he characterizes as the unfairness of the process. Abdelbaset emphasizes the challenges of dealing with government bureaucracy, such as the need to continually provide home ownership documentation and even then the conflicting decisions from officials that made it difficult to receive his rightful compensation. He also talks about the implications of the relocation on tourism and on Egypt more generally, and expresses his wish to return to live in his childhood village back on the hillside. His mother makes some comments during the interview as well.</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
