T /e have the honour to bring to'^TOr^ hrat the situation as far as is known to us regarding the Ajman agreement is as follows The present agreement expires on the 22nd March 1944, and there is a clause giving us the option ol one year’s extension on the same terms. The Company, however, put forward proposals for a renewal of the exploration or option period for a period up to 5 years after the war or, alternatively, a concession agreement. These new proposals are under discussion between our Managing director (ir.Skliros) and the India Office. Our Managing Director has now instructed us that pending the conclusion of a new agreement we are to inform the Kuler of Ajman that it is the Company’s intention to exercise its rights under Article No.7 of the existing agreement to an ex tension of the exploration period up to and including 22nd Larch 1945. This action is to be taken to safeguard the Company 1 ® rights as the new agreement may not be concluded before the 23rd Larch 1944. 2 We enclose therefore, for your information, copies of our letter to the Ruler of Apman explaining to him that the Company intends to exercise its rights to one year’s extension under Article 7. A copy of the form of acknov.'lodgment which the Ruler is being asked to sign is also enclosed. 3.

Dear Mr. Peel, Viith reference to your letter of 24th February, the proposals made the Political Resident in the Persian C-ulf for the extensions of the Ajman Agreement and the option periods in the Muscat/Oman and Dhofar Concessions are acceptable to the Company. Tie are also prepared to accept arbitration by His Majesty*s Government in the event of a dispute arising as to the date upon which men and material can be made available for the necessary exploration work, I enclose two draft agreements which would, in our opinion, cover the Political Resident's proposals; the Dhofar Agreanent would follow the same lines as that for Oman. As regards the Ajman Licence, we have telegraphed to our Bahrein Manager instructing him to apply to the Ruler of Ajman for the extension of our existing Agreement for a further year from 23 rd March, 1 944 in order to safeguard our rights pending the conclusion of the proposed new Agreement, The terms of the existing Agreement do provide for such a year's extension if the Company has not coupleted its exploration work. This right, however, presupposes that the exploration work has actually been commenced in the previous five years but we believe that the Ruler will grant the extension as a matter of fjrm dity. From our point of view, we shall be in a better position if negotiating an extension to an Agreement still in force rather than a renewal of one which has expired and would give the Ruler the opportunity to ask for revised conditions of payment, etc. Yours sincerely, 3d.

No, 350? and goes on to say that the Ruler on November 26th signed an agreement between and himself (i.e, the Ruler) to suspension. The Managing Directors' proposals for extensions in both cases were submitted to the Political Agent and the Political Resident respectively, Mr, Packer hopes to obtain the Political Resident's view on the latter's arrival in Bahrein in the first week of December and he promises to report progress. Meanwhile Mr, Packer understands unofficially that the Political Agent does not favour the • Managing Directors Ajman (?) proposals. The Political /.gent (or Resident, the text is not clear) has been informed of the Managing Directors' alternatives in both cases. The cable as received was corrupt in parts and if the sense is not clear perhaps you will let us know in order that if necessary a repetition of the doubtful passages may be obtained.

Dear Mr. Harrison, Many thanks for your letter of the 8th instant in which you give the text of a telegram from Packer. There is no necessity to call for a repetition as the meaning is clear enough for present purposes. The first portion, regarding an agreement between H.M.G-. and the Ruler, obviously refers to Qatar and presumably we shall hear from you in due course on this matter. The remainder of the telegram refers to instructions sent by us to Packer regarding our .Agreements with the Shaikh of Ajman and the Sultan of Oman and Dhofar. The Ajman Agreement, which gives us survey and exploration rights only, expires in March, 1944 and we instructed Packer to endeavour to obtain an extension of the existing Agreement for a period expiring five years after the conclusion of an Armistice between Great Britain and Germany and Japan, whichever shall be the later, on the grounds that our operations have been interrupted by reasons beyond our control. If, however, the Political Resident docs not favour such an approach, we gave Packer instructions as to the terms which he was authorised to offer the Shaikh for a 75 year Concession in exercise of our right under Article 3 of the existing Agreement, Either of these alternative settlements are acceptable to us but we considered that the first alternative might be preferred by the Political Resident who might not wish to have negotiations for an Oil Concession opened at the present time in the Persian Gulf area.
