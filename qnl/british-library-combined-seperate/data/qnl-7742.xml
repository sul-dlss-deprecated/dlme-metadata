It consists partly of copies of correspondence between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Craven William Fowle, succeeded by Major Charles Geoffrey Prior) and the Political Agent at Bahrain (Hugh Weightman), and partly of copies of correspondence received by the Foreign Office from the British Minister at Jedda (Sir Reader William Bullard), which have been forwarded by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Under-Secretary of State for India. Matters discussed in the correspondence include changes to the value of the Saudi riyal, Ibn Saud's [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd's] indebtedness to the Qusaibi [Āl Quṣaybī] family, and concerns held both by the Political Resident and by the Political Agent that members of the Qusaibi family could attempt to establish themselves as official representatives of Ibn Saud in Bahrain. The file also includes a short report from the British Minister at Jedda, which discusses the state of affairs in Saudi Arabia generally.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Quṣaybī (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Finance</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000266#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000266#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
