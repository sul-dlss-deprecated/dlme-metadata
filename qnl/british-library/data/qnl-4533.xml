Note by Political Department, Jndin OHice, on points for (liscnssion with Sir R- ( ox. I. 1. Policy of His Majesty s Government.—Certain conclusions regarding the i'utiire administration of Mesopotamia were formulated by His Majesty's Government in March IDI7 after the occupation ol' Baghdad. The main conclusions were: (1) that the circumstances ot' the Basra Vila vet were such as to require the permanent retention of British administration ; but (2) that the Baghdad Vilayet should be organised, with British assistance and support, as an Arab State under indigenous administration. 2. Pledges to King of Hejaz.—Certain pledges affecting Mesopotamia were given by Sir II. MacMahon to the Slierif of Mecca in 1915, during the negotiations preceding the Arab revolt of the following year. In a letter dated the Ulth October 1915, Sir 11. MacMahon pledged the British Govern ment 'to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs ' within a specilied area, which included both the Basra and Baghdad Vilayets, and he added an undertaking that 4&lt; when the situation permits, Great Britain will ' give to the Arabs her advice and will assist them to establish what may ' appear to be the most suitable forms of government in these various ' Territories.' This declaration was accompanied (i) by the general proviso that 'it is ' understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance ' of Great Britain only, and that such Kuropean advisers and ollicials as ' may be required for the formation of a sound form of administration 'will be British;'' and u'i) by thr following special caveat in regard to Mesopotamia : - ' With regard to the Vilayets of Baghdad and Basra, the Arabs will recognise that the established position and interests of Great Britain will necessitate special vuuisurcs of admrnistrative control in order to secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local populations and to safeguard our mutual economic interests.'' The Sherif replied (5th November 1915) that the provinces of Irak were ' parts of the pure Arab Kingdom,' that they were 'greatly valued by Arabs far and near,' and that ' we cannot satisfy the Arab nations or make them submit to give up such a title to nobility. At the same time he agreed ' fo leave tmder the Urilish Adininislration foe a short lime those ' districts now occupied by the British troops, without the rights ol either ' party being prejudiced thereby (especially those of the Arab nation, which interests are to it economic and vital), and against a suitable sum paid as 'compensation to the Arab Kingdom for the period of occupation. 1 he Sherif s proposal was never lormally accepted, Sir H. MacMahon merely replying that the matter required ' a much fuller and more detailed consideration than the circumstances o( the time allowed, lie ignored the question of compensation. 1 he Sherif, however, in closing the conespon- dence (1st January I91())was careful to keep this question alive; and he reverted to it later in the year (25th August 1910) in acknowledging the grant to him of a monthly subsidy ol 120,000/. by His Majesty s Government. In this latter communication he spoke of his t rovernment being under Great Britain's guardianship and protection during her occupation of /•asm and Irak. ' Quite recently (4th February 1918) Sir R. \\ ingate has been authorised to give renewed assurances to King Hussain in the tollowing terms : ' His Majesty's Government along with their Allies stand for the cause of the liberation of the oppressed nations, and are determined *o stand S S 40—4 is , Ao , 4 , 1 ^ ; n thpi,- struirde for the reconstruction of an ])y the Ara &gt; i H &lt;'| M ^ ^ ^ once a-^ain replace Ottoman violence, Aral, world m l.y Tnrkl.h olllcials. and unit} the am c - ^ iornicr vlednes tv His Highness ^ U l* ¥c*.

In regard to Bagbda I '^ declarations have been less definite, but Omcral Maude s pr.«h.n.a..o.. of the HJth March 11)17, in the course of which he invite -l the l).igl!&gt;la^ Arabs to join their kinsmen 'in realising the aspirations ol your race, pointed clearly in the same direction. II. 4 It is not suggested that the policy of His Majesty's ( Jovernmrni , as laid down in March 1917, should be modified in essence It is scarce y thinkable that we should suffer the results already achieved to be entirely thrown awav; or that we should allow a country ol such historic assonat inns and future economic possibilities to revert to the blio-hting conditions under which it has stagnated for centuries past, and from which it has at Iriigtu been rescued at so heavv a cost in 1 British blood and treasme. In p.n tn n &lt;n , local conditions being what they are, it seems essential that liasnl shonk remain to all intents and purposes a British port (whether lornially annexed to the British Crown or not), and that the surrounding district should he under effective British control. But, though our aims may remain mi &gt;- stantially the same, it may not he possible, in view ol the great change that has taken place in the general political situation during the past &gt; eai, to realise them in full or in the manner originally contemplated. An eai &gt; reconsideration and readjustment of the policy to lie pursued in the occupie' territory during the continuance of the war seems therelore necessary. 5. The main new factors in the situation may be classified broadly umlei two heads', viz.:—(i) the general trend of the war m Kurope ; and (ii) the general change of outlook in regard to questions of imperial policy which the war has brought about, and, in particular, the spread of the doctrine ol /'self-determination ' under the powerful advocacy of the President of the I nited States. 0. As regards (1), the issue of the conflict still remains in doubt. But the possibility must at least be contemplated that complete victoi\, followed by u peace dictated to the conquered enemy, may prove to b( unattainable ; and that the Allies may have to content themselves with t I VTT „ U 1 „ - U oo of ' IK power alone is m occupation ol enemy territory, li the ( entral J oweis huu*. offer to treat on the basis of mutual relinquishment of conquests, a claim on our part to retain control over Lower Mesopotamia, even il urged on humanitarian grounds, might meet with hut little support; and our case at the Peace Conference will be rendered none the stronger by the lad 'hat three of our adversaries ('lermany, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria) will )eiii the position, which we alone shall occupy anion# the Allies of huvincr enemy territory to bargain with. It must be assumed that, in the event of a peace by negotiation, Mesopotamia will have to take its chance in the o-eneral settlement. It would be as impossible to claim for it any special exemption irom considerations allectingthe disposal of other territory at present in hostile occupation as it would be to stand out for the full fruits of our victories in a particular theatre ol war il no other obstacle stood in the way of universal peace. It is scarcely to be supposed that the war-weary democracies of ( dvai I &gt;rit.ain and I-ranee (to say nothing of other Allied nations), once thev liund themselves in sightof a settlement in Europe on reasonably acceptable lines, would consent to continue the struggle merely for the sake'of a policy uis it could plausiMv he represented to tliem) of imperialist expansion in the Last. It is relevant to add that a situation of this kind may conceivably present itsell at no very distant date. Xo one, particularly at the present 11111 111 ^o'lld \eu1111o to predict the course ol events in the near future. Hut it is at least possible that the growing pressure of democratic agitation may before long compel all the belligerent countries to address themselves seriously to the question of peace. i. A\ ith regard to factor No. (2) it may be quite true that Mesopotamia, by reason of its local conditions, diversity of population, itc., is ill qualified for the exercise of ' self-determination.But it does not follow that an attempt will not have to be made to put the principle into operation. The Prime .Minister, speaking on British war aims on the oth Januarv 1918, included Mesopotamia among the parts of the present Ottoman Empire ■entitled to a recognition of their separate national conditions'; and President \\ ilson has also spoken of the rights of these districts to security and autonomy. 'Autonomy 'and 'separate national conditions' do not seem compatible with annexation (as was contemplated bv His Majesty's (Jovernment in the case ol lUisraj^in any form; while it is not easv to reconcile them even with British suzerainty or a British Protectorate, unless the people concerned, or the local chiefs or leaders on their behalf, can be induced to accept our assistance and supervision of their own accord. S. The conclusions that seem to follow are (i) that if our claim to control the destinies of Mesopotamia after the war is to be established, it will have to be based on other grounds than mere right of conquest, and (ii) that the nature of British supervision will have to be less direct and overt than was contemplated in March PJ1 &lt;. 1 Ins being the position, our policy during the period of military occupation should, while avoiding the creation of a I U-itish administrative system of a permanent character, aim at placing British interests and iniluence in the country (already very favourably established) on so secure a basis as to guarantee their maintenance under any administrative system that may ultimately be introduced. r l he question arises: Is the policy now being pursued a right one, both in its positive and negative aspects / and, it not, what modifications are desirable? It should be made quite clear that, in raising this point, it is not intended to reflect in the smallest degree on the invaluable services rendered by tSir Percy Cox and his able staff of political officers in the occupied territory. On the contrary, the excellence of the work already accomplished, and the magnitude of the results achieved, are appreciated to the full. I he attitude displayed by the people of Basra on the occasion of the Civil Commissioner's recent visit bears striking testimony to the popularity of the British connection among one section at least of the inhabitants of the occupied districts. It alfords proof, if proof were needed, that the material results of British control are bearing fruit in the increasing prosperity, contentment, and goodwill of the native population. But it is felt that local political action would be placed under a handicap, and might be prevented from attaining its maximum of utility, if the Civil Commissioner were not furnished at this critical juncture with full and authoritative infor mation as to the general trend of affairs in Europe, with their inevitable reaction upon the Mesopotamian situation, or if he were allowed to retain the impression (as he might well do, unless otherwise advised) that the premises on which the policy of March 1017 were based can be assumed•1 with equal coufi.lence al the preseul time. It i. ..n tUe^o sronnd. that Sir l'. ( ox has been smimioned to ICurope to confer personally with Mis Majesty s Government. 9 Sir P Cox will doubtless be invited to discuss the whole question of British poliev in Mesopotamia in the li.^ht of the new conditions that have l,e.'n described. Stated succinctly, tlie principal questions to be put to him •nv (0 Is the administrative system now being built up adapted to the contin -encv of the cessation of direct British control? (2) What further means 0 if any, can be devised locally tq secure that, whatever lorin the ultimate settlement mav.take, the main ol)ject desid.'rated by I lis Majesty's Government, viz., a Mesopotamia under British inllnence, shall be secured to the utmost extent that circumstances permit V r l he question is one to which the local authorities are alone competent to furnish the reply, and Sir P Cox will doubtless be able to indicate the particular channels into which discussion can most profitably be directed. The following points for consideration are tentatively suggested (I'i What elements in the population is it specially desirable to strengthen and encourage, with a view to ensuring that, if and when the moment for 44 self -determination ' arises, there will be a decisive pronouncement in favour of continuing the British connection ? (2) What materials exist for setting up a local administration or adminis trations of a suitable character? (3) Can any Arab authority, dynastic or representative, be discovered that would command the necessary moral sanction in the country as a whole ? (4) Supposing a Rider, or ruling body, to be forthcoming, by what means can he, or they, be brought to identify themselves with British interests, and to co-operate whole-heartedly with their British advisers ? (5) Given the establishment of a friendly administration under British supervision, to what extent, and for how long, would it require the assistance of British or [ntlian troops or police? (0) Lastly, what steps can be taken to consolidate British commercial interests in Mesopotamia? III.—CoM MKliClAL 1 )KVELOi^\l i'.N'J. 10. River Navigation. —Commereial and industrial development affords an important and (provided everything in the nature of exploitation of the country in outside interests is rigorously avoided; perfectly legitimate means of consolidating British inHuence in Mesopotamia. One question calling lor special consideration is that of Biver Navigation. The Trade Commissioners (Messrs. Holland and ^ ilson) who visited Mesopotamia in the early part of BUT, expressed the view (paragraph ')8 of their Report) that 'in the first instance ' and for a considerable time to come, the main business of transport, both of passengers and goods, on the Tigris should be carried on by one, Compamj, to he exclusively British in constitution '; and they recommended that this Company should be 'constituted on the lines proposed in 191*3,' with the omission of the 1 urkish and German elements. Lord Inchcape being C oncessionnaire, and Messrs. Lynch receiving an appropriate share. A similar proposal was made by Lord Inchcape himself, in a letter to Lord llardinge, dated the l!0th October 1917, in which he expressed the willing ness of his lirm to start business, when the time arrived, ' as arranged before the war, ' and sought permission to establish a house at Baghdad forthwith. Sn I. Cox, io whom Lord Inchcape's proposals were communicated, was of 1 1 lie history of tbo Concession negotiated in 1913 is stated in Appendix VII. (pp. 94-l&gt;7&gt; ot the toriinnssiouers Report. It provided for the creation of an Anglo-Ottoman Company 'v' j i,. i a Pe as C(), ' , essi&lt;mnaire) to exercise the exclusive right of navigation on the i i is am ,np utite.s (lerman ( Hiighdad Railway Company) participation was subsequently aann Led ' tlle |V 1U of capital beiny:—Uritish (»&gt;., the Inchcape-Lynch interests) per cent.; i urkish 30 per cent.; German '20 per cent. Special provision was made to — ^ &lt; cti\e iitish conti-ol. I he whole arrangement remained unratified at the outbreakopinion (telegram of i'Sth December 191 7) that it would be 'contrary to the ' interests of the country that monopoly of shipping on river should be ' granted to any firm,^ and that ' we shall be wp IJ advised to allow native ' Indian and British subjects to run steamboats on both rivers subject to 44 suitable guarantees and payment of conservancy dues.' He urged that no assurances or undertakings should be given to Lord Inchcape, Messrs. Lynch, or anybody else, that would prejudice independent consideration of the whole question. It may be observed, parenthetically, that, the proposed concession could not come into actual operation until after the war, as control over navigation must remain in the hands of the military so long as hostilities last. What Lord Inchcape had in view, in desiring to open house at once, was pre sumably the general advantage of being first in the lield. The whole question was fully discussed by the Middle East Committee on the 18th February 1918. Opinions were somewhat divided, and it was eventually resolved kt that no steps should be taken to come to an arrangement with ' Lord Inchcape or any other firm until the views of Sir Percy Cox had been 4&lt; obtained regarding the various points raised in the discussion.' Lord Inchcape has since (15th March) written again to Lord llardinge waiving the question of a monopoly, but renewing his request for permission 'to ' establish my organisation at Baghdad now, so that 1 may be in a position ' to begin operations as soon as local circumstances permit.' He lias been informed in reply that the matter will be discussed with Sir P. ('ox. 11. Banking 1 .—Another question of vital importance to the future interests of trade is that of Banking. On this point the following extract from Lord Inchcape's letter of the 'K)th October may be quoted :— ' At the same time it is very desirable that banking development in Mesopotamia should be in good hands in the general interest of British trade, and not left too much to small fry such as small Indian Banks, and eventually 1 contemplate using my influence towards the establishment of a powerful Banking Syndicate, in which possibly Indian and Australian interests as well as British might be associated. I consider this is really necessary, to counter activity of the German Banks in Turkey.' 1 It seems clear that present banking arrangements in Mesopotamia will have sooner or later to be strengthened, and Lord Inchcape's willingness to interest himself in the matter is a point to be borne in mind in considering the question of allowing his lirni to obtain an immediate footing at Baghdad. 12. The early establishment of (1) a Commercial Bureau, and (2) an Agricultural Department in Mesopotamia, as recommended by the Trade Commissioners, are other points that might usefully be discussed.
