The range of hills or mountains in the background probably indicate Jebel Shamsan, or the Shamsan Range, often referred to as ‘Shum Shum’ or ‘Sham Sham’. A number of buildings have been indicated along the shoreline.The sketch on verso depicts a scene on the Danube, looking out across the river from an elevated position. A steamer can be seen in the lower centre foreground. Low hills can be seen in the background.The title indicates that the sketch was made at the site of Trajan’s Bridge, a Roman segmental arch bridge, constructed in 103–5 AD, that spanned the lower Danube between the shores of modern-day Romania and Serbia. Although the bridge was dismantled within two centuries of its construction, the entrance pillars on either shoreline were still visible and are indicated here along the left hand edge and immediately right of the centre of the image.InscriptionsRecto, in pencil:Upper right corner: ‘Aden 11.
