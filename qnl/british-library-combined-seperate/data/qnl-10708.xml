Following official enquiries, the suspicion that Salih Sasoon Mahlab (also spelt Nahlab) was charging excessive brokerage on goods he bought from Kuwait merchants and sold to British Government officials, was disproved and he was allowed to return to Kuwait and resume his business. The main correspondents are Shaikh Salim El Mubarak as Subah [Āl Ṣabāḥ, Shaikh Sālim bin Mubārak], Captain Percy Gordon Loch, the British Political Agent, Kuwait and Lieutenant Colonel Evelyn Berkeley Howell, the Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basra. The petition from Salih Sasoon Mahlab to the Ruler of Kuwait and the letters exchanged between the Ruler of Kuwait and the British Political Agent at Kuwait are in Arabic.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basrah Vilayet</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Salih Sasoon Mahlab</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Deportation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b1#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b1#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b1#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
