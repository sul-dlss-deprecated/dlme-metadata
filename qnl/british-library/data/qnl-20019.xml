No. 3, dated Bushire ; the Uth January 1896. From— Colonel F. A, Wilson , Political Resident, Persian Gnlf, 1°—T' 1 ® Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my telegram of the 4tli instant regarding the attack on Sohar, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Govern ment of India, copy of a letter No. 332, dated 26th December last, from the Political Agent, Muscat, reporting particulars of the rising. No. 332, dated Muscat, the 26th December 1895. From — Major J. Hayes Sadler , Her Britannic Majesty's Political Agent and Consul, Muscat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my telegram of this day's date, I have the honour to report that on the 24th instant the Sultan informed me that he had received letters from certain of the Sheikhs of the Yal Saad at Suweik warning Mm that Seyyid Saood-bin-Azzan-was advancing against Sohar with a party of 200 men. I had arranged to pay the Sultan a visit that morning, and this news reached me as I was on my way to see him. The letters from the Sheikhs were dated the 23rd instant, and Seyyid Saood was then thought to be within half a day's journey from Sohar. The'Sultan told me he had written to Sheikh Zaid-bin-Khalifah to call on the Nairn to rise in defence of the town, and that he was collecting other re-inforcements. 2. Late in the evening of the 24th the Sultan sent a party of 120 men under Sheikh Hamood-bin-Nasir for the relief of Sohar in the S. S. Moshtari a vessel belonging to the B. &amp; P. S. N. Company, and they were expected to reach their destination on the morning of the 25th. 3. This morning the Sultan received a letter, translated purport of which I enclose, from his Wali at Sohar written on the 23rd instant saying that the Hawasinah and its cognate tribes had collected in liozah and were to march on Sohar on the 22nd, and that they and the Yal Saad were expecting the arrival of Seyyid Saood bin Azzam. The Wali reminds the Sultan that Sohar is defenceless and asks urgently for reinforcements in men, money, and supplies. 4. We do not yet know the extent of the rising, but matters point to the possibility of there being a serious combination against the Sultan's authority on the Batinah Coast. From the reports that have been received it is ques tionable whether the Sultan's reinforcements, despatched on the 24th will have reached Sohar in time to aid in its defence, or, if so, whether they could hold out against the number Seyyid Saood might be able to bring against the place, backed, as he is said to be, by the Hawasinah, some of the^Yal Saad and possibly by the other tribes in the Batinah. The defences are in a ruinous state, the town is feebly garrisoned, reliable arms and supplies are wanting and the' Wali, Nasir bin Muhammad, is unpopular, altogether there would seem to be every inducement to invite an attack. 5. I have sent a warning to British subjects to look after their property, and, if possible, remove it to a place of safety. Saood-bin-Azzan, if he attacks' Sohar, is not likely to interfere with British subjects, but past events have shown that the leaders are not able to restrain their followers from plunder for long, and I therefore deemed it advisable to ask in the telegram I am sendcg yon to-day for a man-of-war to protect the interests of our subjects on the Batinah Coast.Telegram, dated the 27tli December 1895. From—The First Assistant, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Eollowins: from Political Assent at Muscat;— Begin*. Hawasinah have risen in Batinah.

Telegram, dated the 28th December 1895. From—Her Majesty^s Agent and Consul-General, Zanzibar, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. % I have reason to believe that money is being collected here for Saleh-bin- Ali and Muscat rebels, and that a ' Hawala '* for four thousand dollars has already been sent there in the name of Rashid-bin-Sleim. The Muscat Agents to whom this money is forwarded are, I am informed, a Banyan named Chater- bhoy and Mahomed Ali, Agent of standing here named Kaki ( ?), Sultan secretly favours the movement, having been persuaded by Hilal-bin- Amer that although we will not let him reign at Muscat he may rule Oman through puppet of the Rostak branch, I have no means of communicating in cypher with Muscat.

With reference to any action on our part should the Sultan ask for assistance, I would solicit a reference to section IV, paragraph 27 i of the Muscat Precis for June 1873, to Julv 1874. I presume that our action would be confined to protecting the lives and property of our subjects in the towns on the Batinah Coast and 1 propose to be guided by this principle till I am able to receive your orders. • Translated purport of a letter from the Wali of SoW, to the Sultan of Muscat, dated 6th Kajab, 1^313 (2iird December 1895). Jfter compliments. —I inform you, my master, that the Hawasinah and their cognate tribes have risen against us. Tliey arranged to collect in Rozah and rise on the 5th instant. One of my people went to them and found this out and one of my friends also informed me. I sent Saeed-al-Adwani to get information, and he reports the matter as I have stated. We have made all pre parations for war, but your tower is dilapidated, and has no munitions of war. The 25 rifles I got from you I have given to the men in the towers; send us munitions of war, rice, coffee, money ; see, we have no money you left on account of heavy expenses; send us a party of Wahabis; send them in the mail or in boats towed by the mail. Fear not so long as I have breath. « « « * * Please send us a gun quickly, for the guns we have here are useless, and do not put me in fault from want of men aud money. Your servant Mubarak's gun has burst, send him another; send me 3 Henry-Martini rifles and am munition; send back your servantZaid-bin-Khatran sharp: if you have rein forcements send them. Don't neglect us and be remiss. We hear that the rebels, the Hawasinah and the Beni Saad, are expecting Saood-bin-Azzan. No. 10, dated Bushire, the 19th January 1896. From— Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Govern meat of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of correspondence ending witli my letter No. 3, dated 11th instant, I have the honour to forward Enclosure from Senior affiS' dated 4th Jan- copy of the report from the Political Agent, uary 1896. Muscat, marginally noted, from which it will be seen that the attempted rising against the Sultan's authority on the Batinah Coast has collapsed. There would seem no further cause for anxiety at present. No. 18, dated Muscat, the 9th January 1896. From— M ajor J. Hayes Sadleb , Her Britannic Majesty's Political Agent and ^ Consul, Muscat, To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In continuation of my report No. 332, dated the 26th December 1895, I have the honour to enclose copy of a telegram I despatched to you on the 2nd instant, together with copy of a letter, dated the 4th January 1896, from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, reporting his proceedings on the Batinah Coast. . , .. . avjij 2 Although matters were not quite so bad as the previous reports had led the Local Government to suppose, it would appear, nevertheless, that a serious attempt was made by Seyyid Saood-bin-Azzan to surprise Sohar. Seyyid Saood appeared before the walls of the town on the night of the 23rd December,Attempt by Saeod-bin-Azzan to attack Sohar. havin'- previouslv bribed the Mukabil who held one portion of the town to let him and his party in. The Wali received intimation of the treachery of the Mukabil in time to replace them by more trusty guards before the attack was made, and was able to collect a force considerably larger than the attacking party. Accordingly when Seyyid Saood made for the quarter in which he expected to find his allies, he was met with a fire from the walls, and finding the garrison were on the alert and that the surprise had failed, he retired. 3. The Hawasinah had not risen in a body as was inferred from the Wali s first report. A party of them joined Seyyid Saood, but the main portion of the tribe held back, waiting to see how events would declare themselves, Seyyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis, too, made no move, and he is the principal factor in Batineh affairs. Report has it that though bearing no good will towards the ruling family in Muscat, he w 7 as not over anxious for the success of his nephew's enterprise, not wishing to see at Sohar a possible rival from his own family to his influence at Rustak, and outwardly at least he gave him no assistance. Seyyid Saood has since proceeded to the Sharkiyyah where it is expected that he will meet Sheikh Salih-bin-Ali. 4. No information has yet been received as to the progress of events at Dhofar. Dated H. M.'s S. Sphinx at Sohar, the 4th January 1896. From—C ommander C. Baker , Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, To—The Political Agent, Muscat. In accordance with a request expressed in a letter to me from Captain Ducat, Acting Resident, Bushire, dated 1st instant, I have the honour to report, for your information, that I left that place at 3 p.m ., 1st instant, and proceeded direct to Sohar on the Batinah Coast with despatch. On arrival there at 7 a.m ., 4th, I communicated with the shore and requested the AVali to visit me. From him I gained the following information concerning the threatened invasion or rebellion. It appears that a force amounting in his estimation to a thousand Arabs under Seyyid Saood-bin-Keis, and armed, arrived under the walls of the town 12 days since from this date. The Wali had one day's notice of their coming and was prepared. Some desultory firing took place, and the rebels finding the place too strongly garrisoned only remained one night and returned from whence they came, viz., Restock. They have not molested any other town or village on the coast. Everything is perfectly quiet and nothing further is apprehended. No reason therefore exists for my remaining, and I leave for Muscat this evening. I should like to bring to your notice the prompt way and efficient means employed by the Wali in repelling the late attack; he deserves great credit, and this might, to his advantage, be mentioned to is His Majesty the Sultan. 4 Exd.—W.
