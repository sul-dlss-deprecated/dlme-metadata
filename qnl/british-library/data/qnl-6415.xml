Usual ending. Translation of a Confidential Letter No.R.4/1518, dated the 12th Safar 1353, equivalent to 26th May 1934, from His Excellency the Ruler of Koweit to the Political Agent, Koweit. After compliments, With the hand of pleasure I have received your confidential letter No. C.193, dated the 9th inst. (23.5.34), and understood what it contained with regard to the military aeroplanes belonging to or used in the service of His Majesty's Government. We always have pleasure in assisting in any matters that appertain to His Majesty's Government. The said military aeroplanes have, in the past, been using the aerodrome without ever being asked for anything in the way of fees, and the benzine which is imported and stored for their use is exempt from customs duty - all this in order to assist His Majesty's Government. V/e now confirm that they, the military aeroplanes, shall also enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, and without any prior permission or being charged anything. We, however, should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bahrein Government charges on account of the said aeroplanes an annual rental of £120 apart from the customs duty which it levies on benzine. We pray therefore that His Majesty's Government will very kindly put us on an equality with others in this respect. Usual ending. Draft Letter to His Excellency Sheikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah, K,C.I,E,, C.S.I., Ruler of Koweit. I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency's letter No. R 4/1518 of 12th Safar 1353 (26th May 1934) to the Political Agent, Koweit, and note that Your Excellency confirms that the Royal Air Force aeroplanes shall enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, without prior permission, and without being charged anything. I am directed by His Majesty 5 s Government to thank Your Excellency for this. 2. In the same letter Your Excellency draws attention to the fact that the Bahrein State are paid an annual rental of £120 in connection with Royal Air Force aeroplanes, and asks to be put on an equality with that State. 3./ ^These letters are confidential and are not for publication. The Draft Letter to the Sheikh is still under consideration.3, His Majesty's Goverranent have directed me to reply as follows: It is possible that Your Excellency has not appreciated the difference between conditions at Bahrein and Koweit. ^.t Bahrein there are two aerodromes, one on Manamah Island ? for which the Royal Air Force pay the £120 referred to, and which is a military aerodrome, established before the civil route was opened, and the other on Muharraq., which is used by civil and Royal Air Force aircraft, for which the same Agreement has been signed by His Excellency Sheikh Hamad as has been signed by you. 4, Moreover the £120 already referred to also includes the site for the Royal Air Force base, quarters for personnel, Rest House, cbc. , which is situated' on Uanamah. 5, iit Koweit there is only one civil aerodrome, and no base. His Majesty's Government regret, therefore, that they cannot pay Your Excellency the £120 which is paid to Bahrein, and Your Excellency, in the light of the above facts, will doubtless see that conditions in the two States are materially different.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000036_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B434</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000036</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B434</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Koweit Civil Air Agreement'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1940/1940</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-01T10:21:14</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (4 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at 1 on the first folio and terminates at 4 on the last folio.
