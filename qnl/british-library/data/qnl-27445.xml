Mr.Eden considers that a career consulate should be opened at Dizful, or some other town, near the headquarters of the 10th Army, which are to be moved to Khorramabad. It is proposed to appoint Mr. H.G.Jakins, at present His Majesty's Consul at Suez, to this pofet, which, it is hoped he will be available to open in October next. * A * *.• ' : V- ' • *. V ■ 1 * ’ . ‘ • 3. Mr. Eden also wishes to raise the career vice consulate at Isfahan, the re-opening of which was sanctioned in Treasury letter E.8404/2 of the loth November, 1941, to a full consulate, and to create a post of a career vice-consul at Shiraz under the superintendence of His Majesty's Consul there. 4. It has also become necessary to strengthen the staff at Ahwaz and His Majesty's Minister at Tehran has i-jroposed that an officer should be obtained from the Government of India to take over His Majesty's Consulate there. The Government of India have offered to provide a suitable man with a good knowledge of Persian and Mr.Eden is anxious to accept this offer. Mr.Baillie, who is at present His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz, would thus be freed for service elsewhere in Persia. 5. In these circumstances I am to express the hope that Their Lordships will be moved to authorise, subject The Secretary to the Treasury.2 . to the acceptance by the Government of India of a moiety, the expenditure involved in the creation of a full consulate at Dizful, the elevation of the post at Isfahan to a full consulate and the* appointment of a career vice-consul at Shiraz. • 6 . I am also to explain that the proposed appointment-^ of an officer of the Indian Political Service at Ahwaz will involve a raoiety of the resultant expenditure devolving on Imperial funds, and, in addition, one half of Mr.Baillie’s remuneration will, pending his definite appointment elsewhere likewise continue to be a charge on Imperial funds. In the absence of provision for these concurrent payments, I am to request Their Lordships* sanction for them, subject to the Government of India accepting liability for their share. 4 A obpy of this lette.p is being sent' to the India Office in the hope that te6**6tary ? of State for India will be able to accept, on behalf of the Government bf India, a moiety of the expenditure Involved, I am, &amp;c,, (Sd) A.B.HUTCHEON. /Ext.3859/42 With the Compliments of the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

Rat ed: 6th Pebr uary . i948l 7 Sir, I hsve the honour to refer to paragrauii_5_of rny despatch No &gt;2 C ircular , (182/2/42)^ of the 13th January,' 194^r, regarding the place of Area Liaison Officers in the scheme for extended Consular activ ities. 2. It has now been decided that in the areas occupied hy ^ r itish troops A.I.O f s are military officers and, as far as Consulates are concerned, cannot go beyond their present duties of passing on information and assisting Consular Officers in propaganda work. In unoccupied areas, uovover, (at present Shiraz Sc Isfahan only are concerned) \,L.0 T s, who hold Consular rank, will actually work as assistants to Consuls in adminstrative as well as propaganda matters. Their duties are, however, main ly touring and, though they will be able to hold charge of the lonsulata offices while the Jonauls are on Lour, they should on no account be retained at Headquarters for this purpose for 'acre than ten days in any one month. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, (I'd.) R. V.3111 LARDSECRET .Copy TTo.48 (720/12/42) mx r X Britiah Consil^te, 3Ji T RA2* sj - ( 14th I ay, 1342. 3ir, J t have the honour to invito a reference to yonr Circular Despatch No.6 (182/10/42) of the 6th February in regard to the place of Area Liaieon Officers in the ache e for extended Consular activities, as well as to your endorsement No.218/8/42 of February 5th covering papers notifying the appointment/ of Ir. R.J.Belgrave as Vice-Consul at Shiraa. 2. The in^t ucVions i^iued to Nt.Belyravc by the Director of Combined Intelligence Centre Irajv require of him activities somewhat more colt rehensive than th-x c envisaged in your Circu ’ar despatch uni^r reference He is required in effect to watch and submit suggestions and reco lendations .3 to action to be taken against enemy agents, 'ifth Coluanists etc., and in general to tako a very active part in the distribution of publicity material, besides assisting His Ha^esty’s Consul in 6r linary Consular routine. 3. Recently, moreover, Mr. Belgrave has been re ceiving telegrams from the Security Officer in Tehran directing him to contact the local Police Authorities in the matter of Fifth Column activities (vide your telegrams lTos.TIl/116, 128, 147, of the 25th and 89th April and the 6th of May respectively). 4. In view of the fact that, in 3 ^ far as the ye si-an authorities are concerned, r. Belgrave's status is that of a Vice-Consul at His Majesty’s Consulate, r have main tained the opinion, with which Mr. Balgrave has expressed concurrence, that any approach to the local authorities on such subjects as security, activities of enemy agents etc., should be made by me personally and not by the Vice-Consul, in order to preserve, as far as possible, the Area Liaison Officer’s cover. Sir. R. .Bullard, His Majesty’s Minister etc. ,etc., TEHRAN. 5./2 5. This in, of course, in many ?/aye desirable, tmt in practice thin procedure is somewhat irksome to me, and somewhat cramping to the Area Liaison Officer. As you are aware the staff of this Consulate is the same as it was ten years ago (excluding the \rea liaison Officer’s own staff) and it wftuld he a great convenience to me if a greater measure of -latitude ^ould he allowed to the ~ r iee-Cone\&gt;l, :ua \rea liaison Officer, to have direct contact with the Shiraz Police Authorities on matters ’ailing clearly within his sphere. 6. X therefore revested ?. el grove to discuss this matter in the first instance with the Security Officer on his recent visit to Tehran. In this connection therefore I now quote extracts from a minute recordeiL on May 10th by B^lgravet- tt (i) it was decided that it would he desirable for the Consul to inform Firuz that the Vice-Consul was really there as an officer on special duty concerned with Security matters and the Vice-Consul could then contact the local Police Chief who would also be informed and, on occasion, Firuz himself on Security matters, always in the Consul’s name, but with more freedom than &gt;M eviouuly. (ii) The A.L.O. should ~ome rather more out into the o~en in the matter of employing agents etc., vith a view to getting more definite evidence for local action against ‘ifth Columnists. In this connection it would he of con siderable assistance to him to have either one or more Indian agents working Urectly under him in Ihiraz and a satisfactory interpreter, which is not obtainable in Shiraz. T his should be a man who could be taken into his confidence, and who lias experience in this type of work. ' 7. \s regards (i) above I agree and would request your permission so to proceed. 0. s regards (ii) I have no objection but I will make it clear to Mr .Bel grave that, his agents will -wet have access to the Consulate compound or offices and that any interviews etc., u t he apronged to t ke -lace elsewhere. I have the honour to be, nir, Your mo-t obedient, humble Servant. (Sgd.) T.V.EPSTTAN, His Majesty’s Consul03 v 5 U \ p V: i COPT (m ci^ir) SXT. 3266/42.
