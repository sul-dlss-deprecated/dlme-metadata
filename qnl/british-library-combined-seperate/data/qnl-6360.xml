The British had information which led them to believe such properties were being used as private property but that they could be restored to the use intended by the donors.The Government of India's recommendation led to updated lists (ff 78-80; f 73) being compiled by the British Consul at Jeddah. Included in the file is a copy (ff 51-52) of the memorandum 'Indian Waqfs and analogous properties in the Hejaz' by HM Minister, Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan).The principal correspondents in the file are: the British Consul, Jedda; the Viceroy; and the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Pilgrims</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Jeddah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mecca</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Muslims</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00015a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00015a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
