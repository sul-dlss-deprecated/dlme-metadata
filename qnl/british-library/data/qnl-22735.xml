Dear Sir, Your kind letter of 24th December has been noted and has received my personal attention. I have reviewed the Company's files on the matter of the bridge across Sitrah Channel and find that the Bahrein Government gave permission, dated 16th July, 1934, for the erection of the bridge, providing the Company acted as follows (a) The Company pay for the cost of moving the boats, then at Ma 1 amir Town, to a point north of the proposed bridge site. (b) The Company pay for the cost of 're-greasing' the boats after they were moved. (c) The Company leave an opening underneath the bridge deck to allow a passageway for small sailing boats to pass under after removal of their masts. All of the above obligations were discharged faithfully by the Company, and I am, therefore, unable to offer you any encouragement in the matter as you request. In reference to Mr. Skinner's promises to you regarding the hiring of all able-bodies men from Ma'amir, I can personally assure you that Ma'amir residents are given full consideration in this matter, consistent with the Company's current requirements for labour. Yours very truly, Original signed by xi. M. Brown R. M. BROWN, mm/vm CH IEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE, ^ PAy THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY, LIMITED.

Respected Sir, With due respect and humble submission I beg to lay these following few lines under your kind consideration. I have great pleasure to bring to your mind about the promises which were given to the people of Ma^mir by the Bapco 1 s Director Mr» Skinner in his time. Dear Sir, at the time of building the bridge of Sitra and also lying the pipes which are in the south of the town ^ now, we, the people of Ma 1 amir, refused and opposed that. But after that the matter was settled by giving these two conditions by the Director to us. The first was to open the boat crossing way beneath the bridge. The second was to give us whole jobs in the Bapco 1 s works. By contract not to receive any harm ^ J™; Company. I thank Mr. Skinner for his favour. He paid whatever said. After long time the bridge was in need ox more power v cross the heavy loads on. So I was requested by him to be agree for closing the way for the period not more than three months. I am sorry the way since that time was not opened. I have found now that the second condition was left also. I counted the Company's coolies from this town, there are 35 persons only. I sent in these days three men of my sons for jobs to Mr ' ^sswood, they were refused. I dare to bring to your mind more about our cars' road ^your trucks began takin mud ^om it. Therefore it became unusefull. So I desire you to pay attention to this case and settle it justly. I thank you for ever.

' /' '-i' The Adviser to the Bahrein Government, The Advlserate, MAHAMA. Dear Sir, The Company desires me to draw the attention of the Government to certain information that Mr. J# F. Gornall has ascertained from the Government records which clouds the Company's title to a road right of way from the Refinery to Sitra Island. Records of the Company's operations in the area in question are not too informative, however, they indicate that permission was granted to the Company to construct Sitra bridge in December 1933 al ^ that the Company received Title Deed Ifo. 84 of 1353 for R.W./l in July 1934• The road in question, therefore was built either at or before the above mentioned dates, across land which was presumably thought to be Government land by all concerned and apparently no claim of private ownership was made for a number of years as it was not until October 9th, 1940 that the Company applied for Reservation known as GR/1B, which was granted by the Political Agent * s letter dated 5th October, 1941. I am attaching map BR-5057-0-D drawn from Government maps held in the Government Land Department, which indicates that part of Government Reservation GR/1B has in fact been registered in the name of a private owner and other areas have been claimed but have as yet not been registered. In the Company's original Lease, Article II, 'The Sheikh grants gratuitously to the Company all land uncultivated at the date of this lease in any part of the territory under his control. In the lands so registered the Company shall for the period of this lease enjoy full proprietory rights'. The Company has, when there has been any doubt at all regarding the possibility of cultivated land and/or private ownership, applied to the Government for a Reservation, thus giving the Land Department of the Government opportunity of checking its records and invite claims before granting the reservation.No. FA-154. - 2 - 12th February, It Is probable that any uncertainty of ownership could have far reaching effects as most of the Company's facilities are situated on Government Reservations which have been accepted by the Company on the understanding that all claims have been dealt with by the Government previous to the granting of the reservation. I bring this matter to your attention with a view to correcting any error that may have occurred In the area In question, GR/1B, and to confirm that-the Company's titles to the other various Government Reservations that have been granted by the Government to the Company are valid In accordance with the terms of the Company's Lease* Yours very truly, ORIGINAL SIGNED BY i R.

File GR-2A Dear Sirs I am to thank you for your letter No, C/L-5 dated 8th May, 194$&gt; in regard to the reservation on behalf of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited of a plot of land north of Government Reservation GR-l /A on Sitra Island. The Company appreciates the desire of the Bahrein Govern ment to prevent the area from becoming marshland after sand has been removed. It has been suggested that a strip of land not less than 50 feet wide all along the sea shore be left intact and outside the reserved area, and that sand should only be removed to a depth of six inches inside the area. The recovery of sand for a depth of a few inches only would hardly constitute a practical and economic oper ation, and the amount obtained would be small, compared with require ments, The Company 1 s intention was to excavate the site to a depth of several feet, depending on the thickness of the sand deposit, and an examination of the contours of the area indicates that, if this were done, flooding of the area, apart from the actual, workings would not result. It would appear the most practical way of obtaining sand from the proposed reservation would be to excavate as close to the sea shore as possible, leaving an area on completion which would be flooded at high tide, but restricted in extent to the actual minimum excavation. | Therefore, it would be appreciated if you would kindly re open this subject with the Bahrein Government, as the requirement of sand for fill purposes in connection with their operations on Sitra Island is becoming acute. It is the Company's considered opinion that, if sand is taken from this area in the manner described, no harmful effect would be caused to the surrounding area. !73(TETI &gt; T- .. '•••*2-—PA-585.
