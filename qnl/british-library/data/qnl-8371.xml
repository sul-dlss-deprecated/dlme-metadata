Hope or James Braithwaite Peile would be suited to it.The letter also asks Pelly's opinions on the real feeling of the peoples in the Gaekwar's territory with regards to the affair, whether their sympathy is real as is being reported in the papers or whether it has been bought, and if it is real does it stem from disloyalty to the British Government or some 'idiosyncrasy of the native mind beyond comprehension'.The letter concludes by asking Pelly to inform Andrew Richard Scoble that he has conducted the case with great ability and good judgement.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023552914.0x000010#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
