This correspondence also discusses broader issues related to customs dues and the British presence in Kuwait.The majority of the correspondence is between British officials but the file also contains a limited amount of correspondence between the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah and the Political Agency in Kuwait that is in Arabic (accompanied by English translations).The file also contains a small amount of correspondence concerning the entry requirements (into Kuwait) for nationals of Syria, Lebanon and Egypt (folios 42-44).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customs duty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000b5#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000b5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
