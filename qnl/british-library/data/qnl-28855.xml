I submit a draft to the Air Ministry regarding the use of the Anson. What are your views on Colonel Hay's Paragraph 4-? 1 am afraid the Treasury will jib at sanctioning £7&gt;000 for the purchase of an air craft unless they can be assured that it will result in a corresponding economy in the Political Resident's other travelling arrangements. Colonel Hay rather suggests that it will mean additional expenditure. Possibly it might be best to defer any action until we can discuss with Colonel Hay in July. u ^ ^ f o frEXT. 1 CW 47 . DRAFT LETTER d) 22 HiiAi W47 / M# W, Low, Esq*, Air Ministry, King Charles Street, London, S.W.l. Would you please refer to your letter «P.280/S6 of 14th April about maintenance of the Muscat landing ground and the nrovision of an Aircraft for the use of the Bolitical Resident. 2© We have now heard from the Political Resident that he will be able to */UVw C*. final the necessary funds^ during the current ^inancial^ear at any rate^ to provide for the maintenance of the Muscat landing ground j As regards your suggestion that he and the Political Agent, Muscat, should make occasional use of the Anson CaIsacA ^ established at Shaibah^he says he is very grateful for this offer and would like to take advantage of it. ( He mentionfi. incidentally that the Anson is at present /onon the charge of the Air Staff Liaison Officer, We should be grateful if you would inform local R.A.F. Authori^ioo accordingly* Bahrein. the ToursPlease refer to your demi-official letter No. Sxt. 804/47 dated the 16th April 1947. 2. With regard to the maintenance of the Muscat land ing ground I think I can pro hah ly find the necessary funds during the current financial year without asking for any additional allotment, hut in future years provision should, I think, he made for its maintenance under the appropriate head in the Muscat Agency budget. 3. I am very grateful for the Air Ministry’s suggestion that the Political Agent Muscat and myself should make occasional use of the Anson established at Shaihah* Actually this Anson is at present on the charge of the Air Staff Liaison Officer Bahrain and I have already been told that X can apply for it when necessary* On the only occasion I did apply for it it was unserviceable and I am informed that it has only 20 hours flying left before it has to undergo a general overhaul. However for the present it is available and I shall not hesitate to ask for it if occasion arises. 1 4. I have examined further the possibility of obtaining and maintaining an aeroplane for the exclusive use of myself and my officers and I have been informed that it is possible to obtain a De Havilland Rapide, which would be most suitable , for about £ 7,000. Arrangements could probably be made for Messrs. Airwork Ltd. who have their headquarters at 15 Chesterfield Street, London, W.I., to staff and maintain this aeroplane as they are already under contract with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to staff and maintain a fleet of the same type of aircraft. If you agree that this proposal should be pursued I will get into touch with Airwrk’s Chief Pilot at Abadan unless you consider it more satisfactory to take the matter up at your end with Airwork’s Head Office in London. 5. I would point out however that even if an aircraft is made available I do not think it will be possible for the Political Resident to dispense entirely with the use of the n Nearchus' or some similar vessel. It would not be possibike to carry sufficient staff and records in an aircraft of the type proposed for a prolonged tour, and for tours, for instance, along the Trucial Coast and the Batinah it is desirable that the Political Resident should have a vessel on which he can spend the night owing to the lack of suitable accommodation on shore. When the Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf is relieved of his commitment at Basra he will probably be able to take me on tour more frequently than in the past in H.M.S. H Wild Goose' which has a cabin especially fitted up for me. Unfortunately however unlike the old 'Lawrence' she has practically no accommodation for my staff. 3.P.

AIR MINISTRY, WHITEHALL, S.W. 1 . . 42 th April, 1947 cA^ Kimg Charles Street, EXT ‘ ^ ft II I © Please refer to your letter of the 13th March 1947 enclosing a copy of a letter from the Political KesTdent in the Persian Gulf suggesting that we should keep the Muscat Landing Ground in proper repair and locate at Bahrein an aircraft which could land at Muscat and be used occasionally by the Political Resident. With regard to the first request, the airfield at Muscat is not reauired by the R.A.F. and we cannot foresee any future^uSe for it. I am afraid therefore that we cannot undertake its maintenance primarily for the benefit of the political officers on the spot* Could not the India Office provide the estimated £100 a year required? We have consulted Medme about the Political Resident’s second request. It appears that there is now no communication aircraft established at Bahrein. There would, however, be no objection to the occasional use by the Political Resident and the Political Agent, Muscat of the Anson established at Shaibah provided that their requirements do not clash in any way with those of the R.A.F. This Anson is fitted with a type of airscrew which should render it capable of using the small landing ground at Muscat. But of course, the acceptance of the task would be on the understanding that the landing ground is in proper condition. P. Donaldson Bsq., C.M.G., India Office, S.W.l. /If /I suggest an alternative draft for consideration. The Political esident has evidently gone into this question thoroughly with the local R.A.F. people at Bahrein and his present letter is presumbly the result of careful consideration. He does not make it very clear how far he considers such an aircraft should be available simply for journeys between Bahrein and ! uscat, but in paragraph 4 he speaks of the type being suitable for landing on the creeks of the Arab Shore of the Gulf which seems to envisage something wider. I should tilin': that the proposal* to have a Sea Otter at Bahrein for the joint use of the Political authorities and Liaison Officer would meet most of the Political Resident*s reauirements and would, no doubt, be a good deal easier to get the Air Ministry to agree to than the idea of providing a special aircraft for the Political Resident. The Air Ministry would, I think, probably be prepared to carry the expense on their Vote and I suggest that it might be best to leave it to the Air Ministry to raise the question of expense. I do not think the Admiralty or Foreign Office would j)TO ^rly be concerned with the-Political Residents limited proposal and I suggest we might leave them out of it. ftE xt.486/47 DRAFT LETTS® (W^t H.W.LOW, Esq., Air Ministry.

It is also most desirable that the Political Resident should be able to visit Muscat at short notice. If a Sea Otter could be provided e„t Bahrein, as the political Resident suggests, I think that he and the Political Agent, Muscat, would be able to make good use of it. I hope it would also be available for the Political Agent, Bahrein, and possibly other Political Officers to use as required - e.g. for the Political Agent, Bahrein to visit the Trucial Coast. 3, We should be grateful to know whether the Air Ministry would be prepared to make the necessary arrange ents. It would, I think, be desirable to arrive at an understanding as to how far such ar/ 0I ^ an aircraft, if provided, would be iVtonded for the use of the Political authorities and how far for that of the Air Staff Liaison Officer, Sincere f.v (S*d) £ K DONALDSONBxt. if 86/47 DRAFT LETTER M*W.Low, Esq # , Air Ministry. ^ i: CONFIDENTIAL on I enclosd a copy of a letter we have received from ^he Political Resident in the Persian Gul£ about coramunicatians between Bahrein and Muscat in which he proposes that the j^.ir Ministry should be •asked^to arrange foi^ the Muscat landing ground to be kept in Woper repair and^to locate at Bahrein a t^pe of aircraft which can land safely at Muscat. This is one aspect oi? the more general question of the provision \of transport to enable the Political Resid^nt^ and the Political Agents subordinate to him^to tour freely in the course of thein duties in the Persian Gulf. We were about ip address Colonel Hay to enquire whether Ut would be /suitablesuitable either to arrange for the R. A.F in Bahrein to carry an extra aircraft on their strength which could be used on occasion when required for transporting the Political Authorities in the G-ulf or whether we should try to arrange with AIOC for a machine which could be chartered for this purpose, / As Hay has recommended the use of an aircraft for touring, he has already answered one of the questions which we would have been putting to him, but before we return a reply we shall be glad to have your cccments on the proposal, generally and to know in particular whether the arrangements contemplated could be made. If so, the question would arise whether the cost of the journeys or of the maintenance of the aircraft should be borne on your vote or ours. Hitherto the expenses of hiring the Basra Port Trust Lighthouse Tender, when use was made of her exclusively for the Political Resident, has been shared between Indian and U,K* /revnues' ® revenues (the U.K.yshare falling on the Foreign Office vote). In future, the whole cost of the Persian Gulf administration will fall on the India Office vote for 13(47/48 &amp;ndi on the Foreign Office vote thereafter, \ I am sending a copy of this letter to Dodds at the Admiralty in cAse he has any comments and to Garran, Eastern Department, Foreign Office, \During the War the Royal Air Force arranged to keep the Muscat landing-ground in a reasonable state of repair, and in the early part of the War aircraft landed there fairly frequently. The present position is that no attempt is being made to keep the landing- ground in repair and that even if it were kept in proper repair it is too small and too closely surrounded by hills for any aircraft at present on charge of the Royal Air Force to land safely. 2. Communications by sea with Muscat are very bad, only one steamer calling in each direction roughly every three weeks, and I consider it important that we should have there a landing ground that can be used and an aircraft available locally that can use it. This will make it possible to bring away at short notice an officer who is urgently required for consultation or who is seriously ill, and will enable the Political Resident or any other officer to visit Muscat promptly should an emergency arise requiring his presence there, 3, It is not difficult to keep the landing- ground such as it is in repair as it very rarely rains in Muscat and expenditure should ordinarily not exceed £100 a year. The provision of a suitable type of aircraft is a more difficult matter. I think in due course the Political Resident should be provided with an aircraft of his own for touring purposes but I do not press for this at present as there would be considerable difficulty and expense in providing a crew and arranging for maintenance. Meanwhile the Royal Air Force have more than once stated their readiness to assist me by making an aircraft available for me should necessity arise. The only aircraft at present stationed in Bahrain is an Anson which is I understand on the joint charge of the Air Staff Liaison Of^jcer, Bahrair, and the Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force, Bahrain. Though it might be possible for this aircraft to use the Muscat aerodrome if it were put in a proper state of repair, I am informed that there would be some risk in its doing so. 4. I would accordingly request that the Air Ministry may be moved to arrange for the Muscat landing- ground to be kept in proper repair and to locate at Bahrain^a type of^aircraft which can land safely at Muscat. should be located here The beat type would perhaps be a Sea Otter which could make use not only of Muscat but of any other small landing-grounds which larger aircraft cannot visit, and could also land on the numerous creeks which are found on the Arab shore of the Persian E.

We have not had any complaints about the difficulty of touring^/' ; since Col.Hay took over from Sir Geoffrey Prior. None the less the position has not got any easier in that time and if we were to put this suggestion up to Col.Hay I think we should be given a good case to put up to the departments concerned here for making this alteration in the Political Resident’s means of transport.

Our idea is that a aeroplane specially suited to your requirements might be procured and placed on the strength of the R*A.F* at Bahrein wh o would provide for maintenance and crew and would have the use of it when not required by you.

In conversation in this Office recently Hallows brought up the question of transport for the officers in the Gulf. He suggested that the best solution would be that the Gulf should have its own aircraft. This would avoid the long periods now occupied by travelling when on tour, could easily be made available to other officers, for example to take the Political Agent, Muscat to Dhofar, and would certainly not be any more expensive than the present method of chartering'Nearchus'. It could be maintained in either of two ways: - (a) by putting it on to the strength of the ftsA.F. at Bahrein and making it available to them when not required by the political authorities, /(»)v (b) by chartering one when required from A.I.O.C. who would probably be able to operate an extra aircraft if they had the promise of regular hire for it. We should be glad of your comments on this suggestion along with any specific recommendations, estimate of cost, etc. you may be able to add so that we can put it up to the Treasury and the other interested government departments here. j . iManaging Directors.

This vessel, now lying at Alexandria, is believed to be practically ready for sea, and is undoubtedly a most outstanding vessel having the advantage that s&amp;e has not been used on war service, and will we think be found in most excellent order. It is expected that plans and full particulars will be Lin our possession within the next few days and if this vessel is likely to be considered suitable for the purpose in view, we shall be very pleased to foiward more detailed information as soon as available. We remain,Ext.1982/46 Vessel for Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf -•-i/ Now that it has been decided by H.M.G. that the Political Resident must remove himself immediately from Bushire, although there is no proper accommodation for him elsewhere available^ at the moment, the question of providing the Political Resident with a yacht becomes of more immediate importance and interest, since the provision of such a vessel would not only assist in solving the accommodation question, but would also help from the point of view of prestige which one must assume will suffer from this certain withdrawal from Bushire. The prospects, however, of being able to provide the Resident with a vessel in the near future are unfortunately not bright in spite of ihe intensive efforts we have made in this direction over a period of more than a year. Our task has been made more difficult by the strict specifications as to size, draugjbt etc., which have been considered necessary. At nresent there are three possibilities in view - none of them very promising:- (a) Conversion of a naval vesse l, as suggested by the Government of India in their telegram 9125 of 27th October 1945* This is not regarded here as a good proposition, but we have now obtained figures from the Admiralty vessels which might be made available (see R.I.N. Liaison Officers note flagged). - / Vt* (b) Purchase/of Motor Yacht ” Phi lam til • Apart frcm the fact that this vessel is rather deep in the draught it is otherwise excellent for the purpose, but unfortunately we have now been informed that it is unlikely that the vessel will cane on to the market for the time being. Itr~ is just possible that something might be done by a personal approach to the owner (Mr* T*0*M* Sopwith)* (c) Construction of a new vesse l* This is undoubtedly the most satisfactory solution from the long term ./ point of view, but it would cost about £ 150,000 4 to build and would take about 18 months* Future responsibility for control and expenditure in the Persian Gulf as between H*M.G* and the Government of India is, at present, of course, quite uncertain and until seme agreement is arrived at it appears unlikely that either H.M.G* or the Government of India will be in a position to commit themselves ib the expenditure o#L a vessel* The question may, however, have to be considered fairly soon* I think that all we can do at the moment is to inform the Government of India of the latest position regarding the possibility of providing a vessel and, a draft letter is attached with this purpose*Ext. 1982/46 H.L.Weip;htman, Esq., C.I.E., External Affairs Deoartment, Go^mment of ^ndia.

Forsyth, H.I.N.L.O., Room 150a., J India Office, London. Lear Sir, With reference to your recent enquiry of our Gosport Office concerning the possibility of chartering a yacht on behalf of the India Office, we have given this matter due consideration and after a full enquiry concerning the vessels of this size that are likely to be available, we are of the opinion that the best and most economical course would be to purchase the most suitable vessel that is available until such time as it is possible to replace her with a new craft. At the moment, we have available the Steam Yachts '’HELIOPOLIS” and M SAYONARA n which are both lying at Southampton in our charge, and we enclose particulars. The former can be purchased im mediately, and we understand that a figure of about £8,000 would be accepted for her as she lies in her present condition. Having been used throughout the war period she will naturally require a thorough refit which we shall be pleased to undertake as presumably there would be no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permits. 'SAYONAHA' we consider is the moresuitable on account of the spacious accommodation and is more adaptable for service in a hot climate. She has also been on service but is in better condition than 'HELI0P0LIS rt and we imagine that a figure of £10/12,000 would be favourably considered. Undoubtedly, the most attractive vessel is 'PHILANTE' which we also have lying here. She is essentially modern being fitted with diesel engines with a wide cruising radius, and most ex cellent accommodation. We have recently had an opportunity of 1 p.t .o1 seeing her former owner who is considering the possibility of resuming ownership, but if you think she is likely to be considered we would endeavour to obtain an early decision, as to whether she can be offered to the India Office. We shall be pleased to forward any further information that may be desired concerning these vessels and to let you have particulars of any others that may become available if you will kindly confirm that the matter is still under con sideration.

He deputed an officer to visit and report on 'Seaflower'. Commander Taylor considers that the draughts of all are excessive with the exception of 'Shemara', w Seaf lower', 'Aletes' and 'Kenkora'. The two latter are, however, only about 165 ft* in length between perpendiculars and are too small, while it now appears that the 'Seaflower' was built in 1882 and is not at all suitable. /ThisThis leaves 'Shemara' as apparently the only ' • m 0 possibility* We appreciate that for the reasons explained in paragraph 1 of your letter of the 18th July to Chapman it may not be easy to persuade the owner to sell her but, in the circumstances, we feel we must ask you to make a further approach to the owner. We suggest that you might explain Itur to him^the Government are looking for a yacht for the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and that of all the vessels available th^ ,, Shemara ,, appears to be the only one suitable for the purpose in view.

Liaison Officer here we have decided that the only practical possibility 1 is one called the 'Shemara'* This is a first-class yacht of modern design and in good condition, of length 212 ft.,, beam 30 ft. draught 13 ft., built in 1938 with two Atlas diesel engines and a speed of 15 knots. The trouble about her, however, is the price (the owner was asking £125,000 in 1940)\ and the fact that the Minister of War Transport m *-* 0 **^'** 1 ' told the owner/a few weeks ago that she was not required for any further service and was likely to be released ti»-hlin in the near future* As you will see from the enclosed letter, however, we are asking the Ministry of War Transport to approach the owner once more in order to see whether his / attitude has in any way changed* We also require a figure to go on before^ financial implications can be properly considered. We will continue to keep you in touch with developments but if you have any conments in the meanwhile^we should be glad to receive them by telegram* I am sending a copy of this letter to Galloway. /Via /fa* 6+j\jUst J7- * ^ /I It , //Q JU**f**' K7 kph cUl* , r A fcL N F.

Chapman, ^ Further to our meeting of yesterday, I have looked up the 'SHSMARA* papers end find that the reason the 'SKEMABA' was not acquired was that she was such an expensive yacht that, unlike the majority of cases, it just did not pay us to acquire. In February, 1940, the owner was asking £126,000 for her. only a few weeks ago he was enquiring, through our Minister, whether she could he released hack to him and has been told that she is likely to be released in the near future and will not he required for any further service. Che does not, therefore, look to he the best ship to pursue. While I am writing to you, I might mention that 'CONQUKROR' is definitely free as the owner does not want her hack. ,&gt;he is oil burning and just over 2^X) , . We turned her down at the meeting, I think, because she was too old; (she was built in 1911) but in view of the difficulties we are having she might go into our list. 3he has been suggested to me to meet a requirement for the American Array in the Far £ast and I think it would be a good thing if she could be either accepted or ruled out definitely in the near future. Yours sincerely. R.K. Chapman Esq., Military Branch, Admiralty, S. .1. o ( &gt;y to: F.A.K. Harrison Ksq., India office Lt.Jdr« l&lt;• O• Lewis, P. Cdr. Taylor, R.I.H.L.O. India OITice.(\di) Vessel for the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, In their telegram No, 2071 flagged, the Government of India /aid that they thought the hJ&amp;DNE suitable for the purpose in v ■ iud, subject to the alterations suggested by the Resident, The • ^•eminent of India also raised the question of the cost of purchase and maintenance and we therefore asked the M, &lt;V.T, for an approximation of the figure in order that we might approach the Treasury, In their letter of the 20th April below the M, tf.T, say that they think they will have to of fer the GjC&amp;LNE back to her owner at the end of the Japanese war and that they cannot sell her outright to the Government of India, but suggest we might use the AUDI'S as a stop-gap for the Political Resident’s purpose and replace her if the owner insists on having her back. This is at variance with what the told us earlier (see my Minute of 2?th September 1944), but I suppose it is not much use reproaching them with it now. The course now suggested by the Jl.W.T, seems to me a most unsatisfactory one and one which we could not reccranend either to the Government of India or to ^ the Treasury, Contrary to what the M.^.T. sav I- believe theet ftu/no alterations 'have yet b een ma ce 'lb the ~ane- I unaerstand frcm the R. I.N. Liaison urricei^ffchat she is still in commission in the Mediterranean, It would probably take not less than six months to have her fitted up for the Political Resident's purpose and by that time the M. J.T. would want to offer her back to the owner, I have discussed the matter with Commander Taylor, R.I.N,Liaison Officer here. As regards the UfldiDNE, he says that while she would probably be quite good for the Political Resident's purpose, she is not perfect; for example she has had to be strengthened a good deal internally to take the guns which she is now carrying. This has added considerably to her weight /withwith the result that even when re-converted she will probably lie so low in the water that the lower scuttles will have to'* be blanked out and the lower regions will have to rely entirely on artificial light. Moreover she has German diesel engines, replacements for which may be difficult to obtain. He suggested that we should consult the Admiralty further on an alternative , choice and said that he thought a frigate or scoop, many of which will be surplus to requirements after the war, might be adapted for the Political Resiaent's purpose as well as a yacht* The yachts requisitioned for naval, wartime service have been mostly altered so severely for their new purpose that it would be a considerable business to fit them up again as peacetime yachts. A draft letter to the Acaniralty on these lines is submitted. Gi-** oURGENT India Office, Whitehall, London, S«W. 1.

While there are no legal objections to this as we have bought ohe snip and her disposal is theoretically entirely in our hands, as I have mentioned in earlier letters, we have given to-the late owner an assurance Ihatfha -will he given the first refusal nn the event of our deciding to dispose of the ship when she is no longer required for naval service. While this does nob &gt;ie us down to returning the ship to the owner, we nevertheless feel that we have a moral obligation to treat the owner no worse than we should treat any other yacht owner from whom we had purchased his vessel. In other words, we should feel bound to offer the owner the yacht for-purchase at about the time we are disposing of yachts generally. In fact yachts are coming forward for disposal now and .while we could leave the ’•BYAilTE'’ until the last minute, I feel we could .not defer offering the yacht back to the ov/ner much oeyond the end of the Japanese war. I appreciate that this may affect the position and we have already spliien to the owner to ascertain whether he still wished to retain the right to ffret refusal. . He replied-with an emphatic affirmative and my. impress!oh is that he would not be very accommodating if we wen-t toJlim now with any proposal for the retention of the yacht a±te]g *var purposes made this unnecessary. As I tie work has already been done on the shi. D.M. Cleary Esq.Political Resident, I think we should go forward on the basis that she is a stop-gap until the end of the Japanese war eases the shipping situation. If at that time the late owner is more amenable she can continue for the Political Resident; if ,not, then either we or the Indian Government must endeavour to replace her. This would mean a comparatively short-term char-^mw* e.g. six months. As regards the other point in your second paragraph, we have in mind a bare-boat charter which means unrestricted use of the ship and the right to make any alterations on the part of the charterer. There is, of course, a clause which provides that on the termination of the charter, charterer must return the ship to the owner, i.e. the Ministry, in the same 'good order and condition as when taken up, fair wear and tear excepted, i.e. the Indian Government .would have to make good any alterations they had carried out. As, however, the ship has been on Naval service T'or some years and the present alteration and presumably any put in hand later on by India would have the effect of making her less like a Naval Auxiliary and more like a yacht, I should think there would be no difficulty on this score as on resale such improvements would have their effect on the sale price and we could adjust with India, In fact, India would thus be recompensed for any work they carried out on the ship to improve her. While I am on the subject of charter terms, I should mention the other main provision in the Charter Party, i.e. that the Indian Government would be responsible for the insurance of the 'SVAIINE' against both marine and war risks at a valuation agreed between us. As regards hire, we should expect to receive £4,000 per annum .'of which £1,600 would represent the normal profit element. I am sending a copy of this letter to Chapmanat the Admi ralty.

She is appreciably smaller than Nearchus which we have always found very tight fit and far smaller than Lawrence which was considered minimum size in 1913. Diesel engines will of course make more space available but seas have not become any smoother. 3. Accommodation required was summarised in F.O.C.R.I.N.*s letter No.4697 of July 1st 19l3 but I think despite increased staff we can do with slightly less now. Apart from accommodation for ship's officers there should be (a) for Residen t. Reception room, sleeping cabin, bath and w.c. and also small dining room for four preferably all in one block. (b) 2 two berth cabins and w.c. for Residency officers for one 8in £l« berth and three double berth with bath and w.c. . (d) for Chiefs. Two double berth cabins with bath and w.c. (e) Retainers and menials. Both covered and deck accommodation for 20* (f) Office room to accommodate six. 4. It is essential that vessel should be thoroughly examined after repairs and before purchase by independent expert. It is also essential that launches etc. should be tested and put in full running order before despatch as no repairs can be made locally. Fans and tropical fittings must be fitted on usual tropical scale before despatch. 5. Cox made point in 1913 that Resident's cabin should be double and for peace time with married officer this is reasonable. 6. It is essential that vessel is fully equipped qith wireless and in peace time two small saiutingcauiuone will be required. plfcIQRr' lii tfARD TELEGRAM : ’ 'J'il' j | 945 A llotted to BxtyeCTSIl ^diJg nTtmont * oJU« CONSIH From Government of India&gt; External Affairs Dept*, Secretary of State for India.

Vifar Of firm.- mentioned this confidentially to the Air Ministry, and after consultation with us they wrote personally to the Air Officer Canmanding, Iraq on this matter, without of courso making any suggestion that you had made any complaint. The Air Officer Commanding has now replied, giving his assurance that everything will be done to avoid further incidents of this sort, so I hope our representations will have had some effect. It seems that one of the R.A.F’s difficulties is that the aerodromes which you normally have to use are too small for large aircraft such as Lodesta# or Hudsons, and that the alternative must be a Proctor or an Anson. The latter type has only recently been added to the Air Officer Commanding’s establishment and was not available at the time of your last journey.

Air Headquarters, Iraq and Persia, R.A.P. PAIPORCiS. 22nd July, 19U* Dear Thank you for your letter of 5th July 1944 with regard to Sir Geoiirey Prior’s alleged tiair-raising experiences whilst flying around the Persian Gulf in my aircraft. I have no doubt that the story which has reached you had been exaggerated, but there has certainly been one incident, and 1 have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Political Resident will not be exposed to any risk again. Upon the last occasion the Political Resident was flown in one of ray communication aircraft, he proceeded from Eushire to Lingeh and back in a Blenheim. It was not possible to use a larger, and perhaps more comfortable, aircraft for the flight, owing to the limited size of Lingeh airfield. The aircraft landed at Shaibah en route to Bushire, and soon after taking off from this airfield the radio receiver went unserviceable. Despite this, the pilot, not wishing to delay the departure of the Political Resident, continued to Bushire, where he emplaned Sir Geoffrey and completed the return flight to Lingeh. Whilst flying from Lingeh to Bushire, the aircraft ran into adverse weather conditions of which the pilot had no knowledge owing to his radio receiver being out of action. Normally, of course, the pilot would have been warned by W/P of the weather conditions prevailing, and would not have attempted the flight until a satisfactory meteorological forecast was received. The pilot reached Bushire safely, however, and the flight, so far as the Political Resident was concerned, was at an eni. The pilot then took off for Shaibah, again without a weather report, and once more ran into adverse weather which eventually culminated in his becoming lost and crash-landing. As a result of this accident, a Summary of Evidence has been taken against the pilot and he now awaits trial by Court Martial. I am grateful for your offer to help, but I am in fact well off for communication aircraft and could not possibly justify a call for any additional to my present establishment. The only difficulty is that the aerodromes normally used by the Political Resident are small and consequently I cannot use a Lodestar or a Hudson, and the alternative must be either a Proctor or an Anson. Me do not like to use a single-engine aircraft in the Gulf and the Ansons have only recently been added to my establishment and were not available at the time of the Political Resident's last journey. \ ^ /YouYou may rest assured, however, that everything will be done to avoid any further incidents.

On the whole she appears to be quite a suitable vessel, if her service with the Royal Navy has not altered her original condition too much o'*the worse, though she is perhaps somewhat on the small side. It so happens that Colonel Galloway is just leaving for Muscat, via Egypt, and it has occurred to me that it would be useful to take the opportunity of letting him have a look at the'Evadne’ on his way through.

She is a yacht of 506 gross tons and is 193 ft. long by 26 ft. 5 ins. She has two 750 h.p. Diesel engines with a speed of 16 knots, and is O'vned by the Ministry of War Transport. The latter department have, I believe, been discussing* the problem with the * India Office. 3. The vessel’s draft at her last docking in 1942 was ll 1 !” forward and 12* 8'’ aft. This will be reduced when the Admiralty have removed the guns and gear which have been fitted. Her lower side scuttles have been blanked owing to increased draft, and it is not certain that they can be unblanked, unless considerably more of the added weight than the armament is removed. Any additions necessary for her new service should be kept to a minimum in order to avoid the reduction of her endurance by reducing the amounts of oil, v/ater and stores carried. 4. The vessel has not been refitted for 14 months and arrangements could be made for this to be done before she is handed over. Her engines are of German manufacture and it is considered that adequate spares should be made available before she goes to the Persian Gulf. 5.

End s,r ^L£ CCP U * A L ' (S 3382/2157/91) 14th June, 1944 / * Dear Feel, I have now had a reply to my letter of the 28th April to Thompson (E 2491/2157/91), about the ’’Nearchus 1 '. It appears that the reason for the cancellation of the Political ivesident^ cruise was an accident to the Stiffe Bank light-vessel, which required immediate attention. The 'Nearchus' had therefore to undertake a spe.cial trip, from which she did not return to Fao until 9th March and this threw all the subsequent plans out of gear. The Consul-General at Basra telegraphed to Prior, at the Fort Director's request, on 24th February that the cruise had to be cancelled, though apparently the reasons for this were not explained. The 'Nearchus' left again on 11 th March on her normal inspection cruise to visit buoys, light-houses and light- vessels in the Gulf, and the American Minister and the American Consul at Basra were taken on board as a personal favour to the latter, who is a friend of the Port Director and has alv/ays been most co-operative where matters of common interest were concerned. Their presence on board had nothing to do with the cancellation of the Political Resident's tour and no deviation was made on their account from the vessel's normal and necessary lights-tending cruise. It will be seen from this that there is no foundation for the R. L. Peel, iisq., C. B. *ii. , M. C. , suggestion that the Political Resident was treated in a cavalier way and that the sole reason for the cancellation of his proposed tour was an accident to a light-vessel. India Office, Thompsonxho mpson adds that the ,, Nearchus H is under the • absolute control of the Port Directorate, and suggests that, while the Port Director is helpful and cooperative, and is believed to be perfectly willing to continue to allow the Political Resident rea.enable facilities, it seems somewhat undignified for the latter to have to rely for his official tours on a foreign Port Directorate*JP*- EXT. 2621/A4. 11 ^ ,i ^ .

Suddenly, we had passed the end of the aerodrome and I saw to ray alarm a series of horrible-looking nullahs, 6 feet wide or more and as deei- flashing past a foot or two below us in guick succession. .^.s soon us we got a little lift and I could take my eye off this appalling sight I looked around for the Cause ana saw the. t the gills ~ ehind the engines, which LUST be wound flush before the take off so as not to interfere with the clip stream, were still projecting. phi- was obviously the cause of our lack of buoyancy and I drew the ^iiot *s attention to it at once. He promptly wouna them in. if there had not been a slight breeze and if we had not been' just air-borne on leaving the edge of this very v.ide aerodrome, we should have hit one of these nullahs at more than a hundred miles an hour with a full load of petrol aud there would have been two vacancies in our already 7 ' depleted cadre. ■? sv-n s ■,r' Y ' Y V'' o.

In the Cas e of the lingah trip the weather deteriorated rapidly as we got nearer Bushire, and though we had left with plenty of time in hand we landed in the twilight. I ur^ed the pilot to spend the night as the outlook was very threatening, but he insisted on pushing on say ing there were night landing facilities at Shaibah . Actually he hit the coa^t thirty miles south of Kuwait, found he had insufficient petrol to turn and. make Bahrain and dec idea to crash land in the darkness.

The wretched pilot and wireless operator remained clinging to it and holding down a wingfor nearly ten hours, until they were rescued with great difficulty by a Sunderland which had to land in a five foot swell. The moment they left it the plane turned turtle and sank. 5. last year, five out of the six archaic Vincents which we used were v/ritten off, and I mention all this to show you that the air is not an unmixed blessing in the 1 Gulf, where we have nothing but obsolete planes, not ^occasion- intended for passenger work. dlven B.C.A.G.^leave something ally to be desired, for you will remember I was booked on the Hannibal that disappeared into the sea off Task, aid owed my life to ■ 1he fact that the Hearchus was delayed a week.

As I have done more than my share of flying in the last fifteen years I am, 1 think, entitled to draw a distinction. if an H.A.H, officer crashes any where he is a hero, and his family is provided for, whereas the Political officer who crashes is just unlucky- luggage.

I had gathered that the proposal in Admiralty letter T.013143/43 of 26th April for the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to use the NKARCHUS did not commend itself to you, and so had further enquiries made. 2 . I am informed that there is a motor-yacht, the NAZ -PERWER of 800 tons, now lying at Suez, which was offered for sale in 1941. She is 249 ft. by 32 ft. by 13 ft. 8 ins. draft, and belongs to His Highness Prince Youssauf Kamel. 3. If you think that she might be suitable, I suggest that you arrange for her to be inspected by the Royal Indian Navy. If this would be difficult to arrange, we could have her looked at by the Royal Naval authorities in the Hastern Mediterranean, though I assume that any negotiations for purchase would be ' carried out by the Government of India. 4. I imagine that a coal-burning vessel would not be so suitable for this duty as an oil-burner, but in case you would like to consider them, I mi ;ht mention that we kn ow of two coal-burners which possibly could b?^avaliable, both of which were contraband patrol yachts in 1940 and are fitted for hot climates.

The Admiralty have since informed us that this letter was written without having seen Sir David Monteath's letter of the 22nd April, and enquired whether the proposal put forward about Liie Nearchus would meet our purpose, or whether we wished them to pursue further enquiries about a yacht. (Apparently they have in mind a yacht which is believed at present in the Levant, but which they are not quite sure is still available.) he admiralty were told that we regarded the separate yacht as much ohe better solution. Their enquiries for a yacht, however, are sure to take time in any case and in the meantime we may as well teul Sir Olaf Garoe what they say about the Ifearchus. If this means tnat the Port Directorate are now prepared to ' SO back to the old arrangement whereby the Nearchus is hired as required tor the Resident l^and is used only for that and lighting and buoying), it would seem wise to get that fixed up as the best interim solution. 2.

As it has not been possible to allocate a suitable vessel.for this service My Lords have requested the local naval authority to investigate the possibility of releasing the NEARCHUS from her present service and making her again available for the political Residents tours. 2 . The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, states that the NSARCHUS, owned and operated by the Basra Port Directorate, is continually employed as Light Tender in the Gulf on behalf of the Government of India. Although the vessel cannot be released from light and buoy work, it is understood that the port Directorate would gladly accommodate the Political Resident and his staff for his periodical tours, combining this with light trips or adjusting the light trips as necessary* 3.

Up to a year ago Prior was able to make use of the M Nearchu 8 rt , the lighthouse tender belonging to the Basra Port Trust, but he was then informed that, owing to age and loss of speed and the increased requirements of the naval authorities for buoying, the Basra Port Trust were no longer able to make the 'Nearchus' available. Nevertheless, Prior was able to arrange last January for the M Nearchus M to take him on a tour in March, but was informed by the Port Director early in March that the cruise had to be cancelled. Bater on, Prior ascertained that at the time when the ^Nearchus ' 1 should have been taking him on his cruise, she had been placed at the disposal of the United States Minister at Bagdad for a similar tour. The India Office consider that such cavalier treatment of tat Political Resident calls for an enquiry and would like to know whether the Port Director was acting on his own or unuer instructions, and if so, from whom, toe should therefore be greteful if you would enquire into the circumstances in which the services of the 'Nearchus” were denied to Prior in order to take the United States Minister instead, toe should also like to know the extent to which the Iraqi Government dispose of the 'Nearchus”.FILE ^ r* D - y - A ^Jptted to Mr* Peel* r?;? n r D :j JmVARB TELBORiM '*' ' SECRET i 14814 I r 4-4 Fran Q’o Dated.

British influence in the Sheikhdoms depends to a great extent on the personal influence of the Resident and his three Political Agents with the Rulers. This j* turn is largely determined by the opportunities which the Political Resident has for visiting their territories and making contact with them personally and, if need be, unexpectedly. Unless he has adequate transport at his disposal, and the ordinary steamer &lt; services in the Gulf are now practically non-existent, it is obvious that the Political Resident cannot properly carry out his duties.

It was Sir Percy’s contention, born of long experience, that negotiations were conducted very much more successfully on board the ’Lawrence* free from shore influence. e* The present Political Resident, Sir Geoffrey Prior, up to a year ago mad 6 use of a vessel named the ’Nearchus*, a lighthouse tender about 580 tons belonging to the Basra Port Trust, which was hired for his tours as required. A year ago he was told that owing to age and loss of speed and the increased requirements of the Naval Authorities for buoying, the Basra Port Trust were no longer able to make the . » ’Nearchus* available# Since then the Resident has had to make shift with such ad hoc arrangements as could be /providedwmm provided by the Navy, the R.A.P. or the • ^ Ministry of War Transport, or to make his journeys by launch, a method which on occasion involves considerable danger and at all times lacks the advantages of a ship of adequate size# Either method results in a most unsatisfactory state of affairs, since both prohibit the Resident from making any extended tours and make it impossible for him to take with him even the small staff required for cyphering and other purposes# In a recent despatch Sir Geoffrey Prior said ^ that owing tojlack of adequate transport he was now being required to run the Gulf with one hand tied behind his back. The Ministry of War Transport on our behalf recently had correspondence v/ith the Admiralty regarding the possibility of providing the Political Resident with a yacht released by the Navy, but much to our disappointment this came to nothing.

(In any case it seems rather derogatory for a great 'fleval jBower like ourselves to be dependent on the Iraqis in such a matter). The S.N.O. Persian Gulf and Ls£ C.-in-C. Eastern Fleet were a^Lso consulted at an earlier stage but had nothing to suggest. Is there anything you can do to help us in this matter, to which both we end the Government of India attach &lt; ‘-vf.— the greatest importance? I fully realise that vital operational requirements must come first, but^i t—a a true ney that the Political Resident also has an important part to play in \ our operational preparations in the Persian Gulf and he cannot perform these functions if his mobility is restricted. /ifIf the local Naval Authorities can still suggest nothing, would it he possible to pursue further the proposal to make a yacht available? We had k S fmt hoped that with the—introduction of the kA-A, ~ new classes of frigates and corvettes the Navy might not now have so much % use for the yachts they requisitioned earlier on in the War. What is needed \ is a good seagoing vessel; the Political Resident points out that of necessity the regular touring has to be done in the cold season and that a stiff sharaal in the Gulf is fully equal to anything one is likely to meet in the North Sea. She would need a saloon (for inte r alia , conferences) and a reasonable amount of cabin accommodation for the Resident and a minimum staff apart from her own officers. The matter of draught is of course also important^ SUeJl because of the f-low-of water on the Arabian Goast, and for the name . /reason i \reason a sturdy seagoing launch would he a necessary item of equipment# There should he no difficulty about producing a crew from India* $ut these are details# C, tvJO* 'c^U- w-' « ^ tdj ^ /-fi jt?

As regards the 'NEARCHUS' I do not there is any pressure we could bring to the use of the ship by the Political Resident, far as we are aware the 'NS ARC HUS' is ov/ned by Iraqi Government and, in spite of the implication paragraph 4 of telegram No.7^3 from the Political Resident to the Secretary of state, it seems unlikely that the Government of India have any control over the 'NEARCHUS', though they have a contract with the Basra Port Trust for maintaining the Persian Gulf Lights. You will know the position better than we can and you will also have noticed that the Government of India have recently cut down the Resident Minister’s tour grant. . * ^ tjt- c ^ _ - - ^ „ vt ^JL JL, ' It looks as though any arrangements made between the Political Resident and the Port Director were overriden by the Iraqi Government. Should not further enquiries be made into this by the Foreign Office? i£o there . seems an ^ likelihood of success, the Foreign Office might ask the Minister in Bagdad to endeavour to ootarn the services of the 'NEARCHUS' for the Political Resident. if the Iraqi Government will not help, the only other local source of assistance seems to be the Royal ^/| Navy and you may wish to consider whether a further approach should be made there.

As you perhaps know, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, Principal Sea Transport Officer, India, and C.in C,, Eastern Fleet, have been unable to suggest a suitable vessel, and Air Transport also has been sought from the Air Ministry without success. M.W.T.R., Basra did suggest in addition to the 'JAMNAGAR', a small oil-burner, G.R.T. 252, named 'RESANG' at present employed commercially in the Gulf, and this might be better than nothing. I have not seen anything to suggest that the Political Resident has considered this ship, but I imagine he would have turned her down on account of size. If he is still anxious to secure a vessel and would accept 'RESANG', we will try to get her allocated. Although the following is for your confidential information and not a matter which I would like you to convey by telegram to the Political Resident in view of the high degree of secrecy, I feel you should know that the V demands for shipping in the Indian Ocean for operational / ‘ purposes this year are colossal.

Apparently there is some chance that one of these might be made available by the Admiralty, since they are tending rather to discard them now for naval work. Probably, however, some difficulty as regards manning would arise. I suggested that possibly the Government of India might be able to help in this respect if a yacht were made available.

Please see the submission at EXT.3859/43• We there informed the Covernnent of India that the best we could do was to arrange for the Jam / ]Nagar* a ship under the control of the Ministry of War Transport* to be available for the Resident's tours when required, as soon as the repairs which she was then undergoing had been completed. The Government of India now telegraph (telegram No•8570 ot 9th October below) saying that the Jam^Hagar is totally unsuitable for the Resident's requirements, and pressing most strongly their original suggestion for the transfer to the Persian Gulf Division of a ship of 750-1000 tons, to be available at brief notice for the Resident's purposes when required. They add, however, that if the Nearchus were relieved of the responsibility for the additionaltrttpyages (which was one of the reasons that the Basra Port Directorate gave in inrorming the Political Resident that it would be no longer available for his tours), a partial solution of the problem would be achieved# It seems very difficult to go back to the Admiralty (who will almost certainly continue to resist the proposal to transfer a vessel to the Persian Gulf Division), without making quite sure that the Ministry of War Transport can suggest no alternative solution. A draft letter to the Ministry of War Transport on these lines is therefore submitted •DRAFT LETT-BR H* C* Boyle, Esq Ministry of War Transport.

You will realise that an aircraft may remain perfectly airworthy long after it has been superseded operationally, and it is obviously more economical to continue to use it for non-operational jobs such as communication (which it can do quite satisfactorily) than to scrap it,anl build a new aircraft for the other jobs. 3. The strength of the Plight at Habbaniya, at our last report, was 5 Blenheims, 2 Oxfords, 2 Lodestars, 2 Hudsons, 2 DH89A, 1 W 4 ll 4 sley, 2 Fairchilds, 4 Moths, and 4 Hart Variants. You will see, therefore, thatj although a Blenheim may well have been the only aircraft available at a given time, there are others there. And that, ws fe-el, gives the Political Resident a better chance of getting air transport than if he were allotted^a private aircraft, since if that went unserviceable he would have nomng to fall back on.

After further representations from India- including a private and personal telegram from the Viceroy - we accordingly wrote officially to the Air Ministry on June 3th and the becretary of State sent a personal letter to bi ^ 1 .-i.rchib.ild tnclair on tne same date# Both these letters urged very strongly, in accordance 'with a suggestion by the Govemment° of India, that the A. 0.0. Iraq should be provided with a twin engined aircraft of the Dakota type, which would primarily be tne use of the Resident but would also be available for other purposes (Ext.2951/43). 2. We have now received replies to these two letters, as well as a belated reply from the Admiralty, to our letter of March ^5th. Prom Anese letters and from, telegrams copied to us by the Admiralty, M.V/.T., and Air Ministry, the present position may be summarised as follows (a) The Admiralty have consulted the G.in C. Eastern Fleet, who, however, is unable to make any suggestions. The Admiralty letter below adds that it is not possible to allocate a vessel from another Gommand to meet this requirement. (b) The 1^.7.have arranged with their representative at Basra ohat the Jamnpar (a vessel of 57« gross tons** recently taken over by M. *». T# from the naval base at Khorramsiiar) should be made available to the Political Resident for his tours when required# This vessel, however, is at present undergoing alterations and repairs, but should be ready about the end of tais month (see telegrams from M.W.T. representative Basra, No. 351 of May 27th and 379 of June 10th‘ and M.17.T. telegram No. Mast 1810 of June 16th)• 'V Th£ L.t.

Headquarters replied - (i) tiiat their limited communication and transport resources precluded their allotting one aircraft for the exclusive use of ohe Resident, and in any case they deprecated as uneconomical specific allotments of this nature. (This objection is based upon a misapprehension of our request^ which was for an aircraft to be primarily for the use of the Resident but also available for other purposes)^ (ii; that the a.0. C.Iraq had with one exception been able to meet all requests from the Resident and so long as his future requests were not more numerous than in the past Headquarters considered that they could be met from this source. t Pr (VvA 2 &lt;3j /u P/?.i The letters from the .dr Ministry and Sir Archibald Sinclair underline Na./lg'fdf- these two points, and conclude by turning down our request.

NEARCHUS to enable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to carry out his official tours, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to inform you that they have made enquiries of the Commander-in-chief, Eastern Fleet but regret that no suitable alternative to NEARCHUS can be found. It is not possible to allocate a vessel from another Command to meet this requirement. The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf has, however, reported that although a vessel cannot be allocated permanently for the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Ministry of War Transport have agreed locally with the Political Resident to make suitable arrangements for him and his staff to take passage in S.S.JAMNAGAR (recently taken over by the Ministry of War Transport from the Naval Base Khoramshar) or other Ministry of War Transport vessel when he requires to carry out official tours in the Persian Gulf.

Unfortunately, however, the general shortage of transport aircraft makes it impossible to accede to the Government of India*s request. Headquarters, Royal Air Force, Middle Hast, state that with one exception they have been able so far to meet all the requests of the Political Resident for air transport and that so long as future requests are not ihore numerous they consider that they can be met from the Communications Plight at Habbaniya. 3. In this connection it appears that the Resident has been misinformed with regard to the strength of that Plight, watch consists of a total of twenty four aircraft. It is agreed that not all the aircraft are suitable for the Resident's purposes, but nevertheless the Council concur with the opinion of the Command that there should be no difficulty in meeting the majority of the Political Resident's requirements from aircraft already in the country.

The Government of India’s telegram No.2042 of March 13th, which was despatched during the Political Resident's visit to New Delhi, emphasised the serious situation which faced the latter owing to the fact that the L.T. Nearchus was no longer available for his tours. It also stressed the inadequacy of war time communications in the Gulf, and added that the Naval Authorities both there and in India had been unable to help by providing sea transport for the Resident. The Government of India urged on the other hand that war conditions made it more than ever necessary that the Resident should be able to tour freely and rapidly to all points in his charge; and they accordingly asked that either a suitable vessel should be added to the charge of the Persian G-ulf Division on the understanding that it would be made available at brief notice for the Resident's purposes or a twin-engined transport aircraft should be added to the charge of the R.A.P. Command in Iraq on similar terms. 2. In the submission above the Government of India's telegram it was decided to urge the Admiralty to accede to their first request, but without making any mention of the fact that the G-ovemment of India had suggested as a pis aller the provision of a transport aircraft; and not to approach the Air Ministry unless and until it became clear that the Admiralty could not help. 3* The Admiralty have never replied to our letter^*- As a result of oral, enquiry it was eventually discoversctf^^ing themselves unable to accede to our request, fcha± they had referred the matter to the Ministry of War Transport. The latter told us that it was improbable that they would be able to help, but they telegraphed to their representative at Basra enquiring whether, after consultation with the Political Resident, he could make any suggestions for solving the problem. He replied that the Resident was asking for a steamer for periods of ten days or more to carry a party of seventeen; for this purpose it might on occasions be possible to allocate the Tinombo (827 gross tons with accommodation for ten first class, twelve second class and 500 deck passengers), but meanwhile he was arranging accommodation as best possible by the Tinombo, the Resang (250 gross tons) or other vessels which though not so convenient afforded a reasonable alternative. Colonel Prior has reported, however, that he was offered space on the Tinombo with the proviso that he could not take first class passengers; and that, as it was impossible to move without them, he was obliged to refuse. In reply to an enquiry by the Ministry of War Transport their Basra representative has stated that another vessel, the Jamnagar, would be suitable for the Political Residents tours; but that it will have to undergo alterations and repairs which are likely to take two months. i- + It ihcuT fhA dtak 4* As recently as May 31st we wrote to the Ministry of War Transport asking them to impress once more upon their Basra representative the importance of meeting the Resident's needs, and to enquire of him how the matter now stood (Ext. 2847/43) • Hardly had we done so, however, than we received the Government of India's telegram No.4310 of June 1st which urges that, since it is evident that the Resident's needs cannot be met from local resources and since there is apparently no prospect of providing him with a suitable ship, H.M.G. should give further immediate consideration to the provision of a twin-engined aircraft of the Dakota type. The Government of Indiafsrequest is strongly supported in a private and personal telegram from the Viceroy. 5» I©n May 7th, before it had been established that the help afforded by the Ministry of War Transport would be inadequate, we made an informal approach to the Air Ministry. They were given a copy of the Government of India's telegram of March 13th, the position was explained to them, and they were asked whether it was likely that, if it became clear that no ship could be provided, they/ii + It kcub 1hcuT fhA ^jL^cfic. oV^a c£ao^ 9 M f$t&gt; they would be able to comply with the Government of India's request for a transport aircraft. The Air Ministry took action rather more quickly than we had expected, telegraphing to A.H.Q. Iraq with the request that they would meet the Resident's requirements to the best of their ability from their present resources. The telegram added that the Air Ministry could not allot to Iraq additional transport aircraft (Ext.2433/43) • They also sent us an official letter dated May 12th (Ext.2522/43;. The Political Resident has since reported that the A.O.C. Iraq has no cornraunication aircraft apart from the Oxford machine which he himself uses, and can offer nothing for the Resident's tours except a Blenheim which is suitable only for an emergency dash. 6. It is submitted that in view of the Government of India's strong representations we should now bring all possible pressure to bear on the Air Ministry to comply with the request made in the Government of India's latest telegram. For this purpose a draft official letter has been prejjared, together with a draft personal letter from the Secretary of State to Sir Archibald Sinclair. vi. +3.

This letter followed an informal approach made on May^tth by this Office to the 1 Air Ministry, who were furnished with a copy of the Government of India*s telegram No.2042 of Larch 13th (further copy enclosed herewith). It was pointed out that this telegram emphasised the serious situation v/hich faced the Political Resident owing to the inability of the Basra Port Directorate to continue to make available the L.T.

This meant that he/' i I ‘l - tea Lin r *jo :s*i ^noaorr lis.^d* icrx'l 'v;--- •r ' ^rf- CKT s kVas &lt; ^ en ied the use of his sole^means of transport at a time when coranunications in the Gulf were seriously restricted owing to war conditions and when, Oil the other hand, it was more than ever necessary that he should be able to tour freely and rapidly, oince the •Naval authorities in the area were unable .to assist, the Government of India had requested what a vessel might be added to the charge of the Persian Gulf Division on the understanding that it would be available at brief notice for the Resident's puiposes; or^xailing tnis, that a twin~engined transport aircraft should be added to the charge of the R.A.P. Command in Iraq, to be available for the Resident’s journeys as and when required. It was explained to the Air l&amp;nistry tnat on receipt of this telegram the India Office had made strong representations to the Admiralty in favour of the first alternative advanced by the Government of India; out had decided to take no action on the second alternative until it became evident that no * suitable vessel could be made available. The Admiralty/3 Acb dralty had not found it possible to furnish the assistance n^Lired; and the Ilinistry of War Transport, to whoa they had referred the matter, could likewise offer no vessel for the purpose, though they had enquired of their representative at Basra whether he could assist the Resident from the resources at his disposal* In these circumstances, and in viev/ of the lapse of time since the receipt of the Government of Indian telegram, the Air Ministry were asked informally whether it was probable that they would be able to comply with the second alternative request made by the (Government of India, The Air ministry there upon despatched to Iraq their signal \ No.Ox,6861/ of May 9th, and addressed to this Office their letter under reference. 4. It has since become increasingly cleai that there is no prospect of its being possible to make available a suitable ship for the Resident’s use; and the lanistry of War Transport’s representative at Basra lias suggested/suggested no expedient which can be regarded as iji any satisfactory. Lr&gt;reover ■, the Resident has reported that^ apart fran the Oxford aircraft used by the A.O.G. himself . t the R.A.P. Gosjuiiand in Iraq have no communication aircraft and can offer him nothing except a Blenheim which is only suitable for an emergency dash. The Government of India have, therefore, in a further telegram IJ 0 . 43 IO of June 1st, 01 which a copy is enclosed, urge^that II.Ii.G. should give immediate consideration to the possibility of providing the A.O.G. Iraq with a tv/in-engined aircraft ■type, 01 the Dakota,/which would primarily be for the use of the Resident but would also be available for other purposes. They ask that a decision should be taken witn zhe least possible delay since they regard the Resident's continued immobility with increasing apprehension.

The Viceroy has telegraphed to me personally strongly supporting this request and I should be most grateful if you would give it sympathetic consideration. The circumstances which make it necessary to ask for this are fully stated in the official letter and we have tried our best without success to get assistance from the Admiralty or Ministry of War Transport which would make it unnecessary. I am sure you will appreciate how vitally important it is at the present time that we should maintain, as a primary war interest, a fully effective Political administr ation on the Arab shore of the Gulf (which for the present purpose can be regarded as extending round the south coast of Arabia as far as Salalah). Vie are making considerable demands on the Rulers of the states in this area for facilities required in the interests of our war effort; and I think it may fairly be said that of these demands none are more important to us than those made on behalf of the R.A.F. You will know better than I what is being done to open up the air route along tne southern coast of Arabia; and what part is played in the network of our air communications by the R.A.F. establishments at Bahrein, Sharjah and elsewhere.

DE?T. 2 1 A PR INDIA OFFICE!• The various arrangements made from time to time for providing transport for the Political Hesident*s tours are described in Mr. Gibson 1 s note at PZ. 63 I 8 / 39 . Up to 1926 the Resident had at his complete disposal a despatch vessel, the R.I.M.S. 'Lawrence'. In the period 1926 to 1931 he was able to hire, first the 'Patrick Stewart', a cable ship of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, for about seven weeks a year; and later a vessel of the B. I.S.N.Company. (The Government of India met the whole cost both of the 'Lawrence' and of the hire of the two latter ships). Thereafter until 1939 the Resident had to make shift with the assistance of the Navy, the R.A.P*, Imperial Airways and afe.il steamers. 2. The Political Resident’s telegram to the Government of India No. T/266 of September 23rd 1939, to which their telegram below refers, described how the outbreak of war, while depriving him almost conpletely of the aids to travel enumerated at the end of the last paragraph, had made it more than ever necessary for him to tour to all places of political importance in the Gulf. He therefore asked that the Government of India j if they could not place a despatch vessel at his disposal for the duration of the war, should agree to his hiring the 'Nearchus’’ a vessel of 380 tons belonging to the Basra Port Trust and used for maintaining the lights and buoys along the whole course of the Gulf. The terms of hire were £57 (Rs« 760 ) a day, with the concession that no charge would be made forxinjrneys on the ^gj^el’s normal duty; and the Resident askecljuor this purpose^an additional grant of Rs. 69,0 00 (representing 90 days hire) should be sanctioned for afyjgdHiti rmnl year. He estimated that this would be sufficient for his maximum requirements. He commented that the vessel was very small and would be far from comfortable in rough w e at her ^ but that she had adequate accommodation for him and his office staff. 3* The Government of India’s telegram No. 1793 of October llth^said that, having been unable to procure a despatch vessel for the Resident, they proposed to sanction his hire of the 'Nearchus'. They added that the expenditure involved should be treated as special war expenditure, to be allocated between H.M.G. and the Government of India in accordance with whatever principles might be agreed upon regarding the incidence of such expenditure on the Arab coast. This arrange ment was approved by the Treasury (PZ.7259/39). 4* The Basra Port Trust have now told the Political Resident that they can no longer make the 'Nearchus' available for his tours; and he has taken the opportunity of his visit to New Delhi to discuss the resulting situation with the Government of India. Mail steamers now visit the Gulf with decreasing frequency; and neither the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, nor the Flag Officer Conmanding, R.I.N., can help. On the other hand, the Government of India consider it vital that in present circumstances the Resident should be able to tour freely and rapidly to all points in his charge. They draw attention in particular to the economic crisis which has arisen on the Arab shore owing to the cessation of cereal imports from India; and to the need for closer attention to the Persian shore, where the Senior Naval Officer recently asked the Resident to institute a coast watching scheme. To meet this situation the Government of India that either - (a) a vessel of between 750 and 1,000 tons should be added to the charge of the Persian Gulf Division on the2 . understanding that it 'would 'be available at brief* notice for the Residents purposes; or, failing this, (b) a twin-engined transport aircraft should be added to the charge of the R.A.F, Command in Iraq to be available for the Resident * s Journeys as and when * required. f\ The Government of India stress the urgent necessity for the adoption of one of these measures. They do not, however, oifer to make any financial contribution towards either of them. (It is assumed that the Government of India bear no part of the cost of either the Persian Gulf I&amp;vision or the R.A.F. Comnand in Iraq; perhaps the Financial Secretary will advise on this point.). This telegram has not been circulated except to the Foreign Office, as it was feared that the Admiralty and or the Air Ministry might each take the line that it is for the other to do what is required. For the same reason it is proposed to approach the Admiralty, on the lines suggested by the Government of India, with a self- contained letter; but not to approach the Air Ministry until it is clear that the Admiralty are unable to help. Even with this method of ar^ptroach it is unlikely that either Department will be prepared to comply with our request; but the draft letter to the Admiralty which follows is intended to serve as a first step. yfarj^gtaff, Financial Secretary, r* ^ ^ IU ' . v u UO ■ For any observations. i&amp;&gt; DRAFT LETTER.

The © S.W.l. £$ UAR 1943 Sir, I am directed ‘by the Secretary of State for India to refer to his telegram No. 2610 of October 2?th 1939 which sanctioned the arrangements ^ * proposed in the telegram from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf No. T/266 of September 23rd 1939 and the Government of India' s telegram No. 1793 of October 11th 1939, for the hire of the L.T. 'Nearchus' by the Political Resident for the purpose of his tours. Copy of these three telegrams was forwarded, to the Admiralty under India Office Nos. PZ.5970/39 and 6345/39. — . __ * &gt; _ L» -- * 2. The Political Resident has now been informed by the Basra Port Directorate (to whom the Nearchus belongs) that owing to (a) the increasing age and loss of speed of this vessel and (b) the increased&amp;oyages of the Naval authorities/! *rm ./ 2 . authorities, they are no longer able to make her available for his tours. The oenior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, is unable to assist; ;and mail steamers no longer operate in the Gulf to a schedule of any value to the Resident. W*. fo tb4 $]£ % The Government of India^emphasiseythat the interests within the Resident's charge,S^always important bat are doubly so in time of war, particularly ■when the Persian Gulf States, owing to the cessation of cereal imports from India, are being subjected to unprecedented economic stresses which may have repercussions upon their political stability. They ... . ’ - &lt; , add that in their opinion the Persian littoral requires far closer attention than it has hitherto received (in this connection I am to refer to the Political Resident *s telegram to H.M. Minister, Tehran Lo. 611 of February 16th - further copy enclosed for ease of reference - reporting that the Senior Naval Officer had asked the Resident to institute a coast watching scheme along the full length of this c(jjbt). While therefore it has always been important that the Resident/Resident should 'be mobile, the Government of India consider it vital in present circumstances that he should be able to tour freely and rapidly to all points of his charge.. 4. llie Government of India have consulted the Flag Officer Comnanding, R.I.N., who however is unable to assist since he is himself seriously short of craft for operational purposes. They have therefore felt obliged to request that H.M.G. should examine urgently the possibility of putting into th&lt;? ^ulf a vessel of between 750 and 1,000 tons which, they suggest, might be added to the charge of the Persian Gulf Division on the understanding that it would be available at brief notice for the Resident's purposes. The Government of India add that they fully realise the shortage of craft of this kind ^but they consider it of the first importance as a war measure to ensure the continued mobility of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. They regal’d this^as an inescapable requirement if a of- fkji /m. deterioration's to be avoided. 5. Mr. Amery fully supports the Government of India's/India's request and hopes that, ■i-ha ggr'y Vv. i^X^i &lt;^r fc g»«At^pressure on shipping at their disposal. Lords Consnissioners of the Admiralty -will find it possible to spare a vessel for this purpose* He would be glad to learn their views at the earliest possible date. 6. a copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office.

There is’additional reason for retaining .angah. I have just seen Lean who states it is on the locust Immigration route at point served by no other means of telecommunication. If Lingah is closed down we may get no warning of flights until days or even weeks have elapsed.

Despatch vessel for use of Persian Gulf Resident. 2. Ever since the loss of the 'Lawrence', Resident has been gravely handicapped for transport despite temporary expedients such as the 'Patrick-Stewart', Since then, situation has become increasingly difficult and we have been obliged.to depend on (a) begging lifts from sloops; (b) begging lifts from flying boats; (e) Imperial Airways; (d) mail steamers. Loch drew {attention to the position as 7£3$7 3 3 long ago as 19 33, in private letter of October 6 th to Walton and Fraser= fytis r. 3. Matter has now become acute; (a) sloops are no longer available as they are entirely occupied with naval duties; (b) the flying boats have been withdrawn, and their suecesriors are impossible for touringo A request for a plane to bring Galloway to Bahrain has just been refused; (c) Imperial Airways now have much reduced service and only land at Bahrain and Dibai. They cannot guarantee passage till last minute and it is impossible to transport office or staff this means. (d) Mail steamers are irregular, (last down mail/ RECD.POL.DEff? 2 5SEP1939 INDIA OFFICE \r * *~ \ r‘ i 5970 L-1M2 J mail was 4 days late) and overcrowdedo They do not call at majority of places Resident has to visit, and owing to fortnightly calls at certain pwcts he may he marooned for long periods. It is impossible to do highly confidential work while being trodden underfoot, and despite every precaution it is only question of time before one or more of 40 confidential boxes gets lost or stolen. Further, owing to Admiralty restrictions they cannot use wireless in the open sea, so we may be cut off for 48 or 72 hours at a stretch. In other words Resident is now completely immobilised. Whereas touring was formerly eminently desirable, it is now vital necessity. We can no longer rely on Navy who are fully occupied with their own problems. Resident must be able to tour all places of political importance and make sufficiently long stops to ^t to know Sheikhs befor e difficult questions arise* Arabs are amenable to personal influence, and his ability to make prolonged tours was undoubtedly the secret of Sir P.Z. Gox 3 s influence with them, 5. (a). If I cannot tour, my appointment loses two-thirds of its value. I therefore hope that the Government of India will place despatch vessel at the disposal of the Resident for the duration of the war; (b) If this is impossible I suggest the following. I have ascertained that the 'Nearchus' is available for £57 per diem with the valuable concession that no charge will be made for journeys on normal duty. She is very small (580 tons) and would be far from comfortable in rough weather, but has adequate ac c oramo da tion/accommodation for me and also for the office staff (which is most important) and is otherwise suitable, I request that additional grant of Rs«&gt;46*000 be made immediately available (representing 60 days hire) for the current financial year and Rs*69 3 000 for next year* I will, of course, endeavour to take advantage of her normal bruises as far as possible and consider figures mentioned should be maximum requirements? (c) I presume expenditure debitable to war and request favourable sanction at earliest possible date to enable me to fit in tours with her normal duties® An early start is essential so as not to be delayed by bad weather®</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000fb_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3689</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000fb</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3689</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 29/111 'Bushire: provision of transport for tours of Political Resident'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-10-11T22:48:25</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (320 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 322; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the provision of transport facilities for tours of the Political Resident at Bushire to the Persian Gulf, by ship and aircraft.The file is composed of correspondence between the Political Resident at Bushire, the Viceroy, the British Legation at Tehran, the Treasury, the Foreign Office, the India Office, the Secretary of State for India, the Air Ministry, the Ministry of War, the Admiralty, the Government of India, and Camper &amp; Nicholsons Limited.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Tours</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Treasury</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000fb#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
