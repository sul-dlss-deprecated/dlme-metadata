The letter also records Sultan Ahmed Khan's reaction to Mr Khamkoff's approaches on discovering Russian intentions of extending their influence through Khiva, Bokhara and Turcomania [Turkmenistan] and that Mr Khamkoff had been obliged to depart without any real success; and that he had also received a flat refusal from Dost Mahomed Khan to the proposal. The letter also states that Mr Khamkoff's motives for remaining in Herat over the winter were not clear, but that the fact that the survey party then arrived in key places in the spring, the same time as an army would arrive could be significant in this. The letter also notes that Mr Khamkoff collected scientific facts on archaeological remains and geological and botanical specimens, which were believed to be complete and valuable.The letter goes on to discuss the rumours relating to the mission's expenditure, which Pelly believes to have been exaggerated as reports of the missions actions and lifestyle did not suggest any excess, and the gift which they gave to the Sirdar was valued by him at 1000 tomans. It also attempts to account for the reasoning behind the Russian mission, which Pelly believe's followed on from Persia's failed attempt to take Herat and their subsequent desire to determine whether they could reach Hindoostan [Hindustan] from Candahar and avoid the plain of Herat; and the suggestion that in entertaining the Russian mission at Herat the Sirdar's intention was to attempt to make the British court their friendship again.The letter concludes by asking His Lordship what salary he should draw for the period he has been employed on this special duty, and stating that he had drawn an advance on the salary from Bombay in order to cover expenses incurred en route.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023882889.0x000014#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
