For two years the agents heard not a word as to what had become of the ves sel. Burton would not answer any letters, then they applied to the Foreign Office. Bu rton gave evasive replies until he got to Biazil, whence he wrote saying he had spent all the money (£280), and that they still owed him £320 for articles supplied to the crew. His bill is published in cxtenso and it is a curiosity. Burton appears to have kept a general store. The bill begins— To one bottle brandy, 4^. 2d. To tin sardines, Is. 2d. To 20 lbs, rice, 4s. 6d. and so on. The agents are going to sue Burton in a civil court, and he will L-ave to comerhome. J. A ugustus Grant, Ath Goorkhas. RUSSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA.—II. (By a Travkller.) ( I n considering Russia in the East there are two parties always to be kept in view—the old re-actionary Russian party, whose motto is ag gression and intervention in European affairs, God above, the Czar below ; and the new liberal party who had a hard struggle in carrying out •mancipation, which they could only effect by the influence of the Czar, as the majority of the Council of the Enipire voted against the mea sure. With the former party uo Englishman ®nght to have any sympathy. But with the lat ter all ought to feel, as their programme is— liberal institutions at home, peace and commerce abroad. There are three measures lately passed in Rus sia which indicate the slow but sure progress Of the liberal party. A reduction has been made in the army of 340,000 men. In 1664 it amounted to 1,135,000 infantry and 9G,000 cavalry ; now it •tandsat 805, OuO infantry and 75,000 cavalry. The military budget was in 1864 £25,000,000 sterling, it is now £19,000,000 sterling. On the other hand the Education grant has received a great •ugmentation, amounting to £2,500.000 sterling. 3t stands in proportion to the entire budget of £63,000,000 sterling at 30 per l ^OUO, while in l 1 ranee it is 11 per 1,000, and in Prussia 14 per 1000, though the proportion of pupils to the population in Russia is only 2 per cent. ; in France it is 12^ percent, and in Prussia 16| per cent. The third measure came into operation last January which makes a great reduction on the postage of journals and letters abroad. The Russian liberals feel that the development of trade with Asia is of great consequence for Russia, and particularly in the direction of Central Asia, where the manufacturing industry of Russia can find a veut and from which she herself can be supplied with cotton, minerals, &amp;g. Her position •n the Oxus gives her a secure position for trade. The important questiun for us here is—is it to be regarded is a menace to India ? As to any move on India with armies, Russia never measur ed herself but once against England and the effects of that in the Crimean War the present generation will never forget. The Russians know well the indomitable pluck the English displayed during the mutiny against fearful odds, and they admire them for it. They know therefore that any active designs against India would call out ail the energy of the British empire iu defence, •^nd would inflict great damage on ''j';- real d iru- &gt; tl. in India in stirring up the embers of disaffection. The limit assigned to a letter like this will not allow treating this subject in full, but the following points deserve consideration. Would not the nearness of frontiers be an ad vantage in this respect, that both parties would be come better acquainted with each other and consequently misunderstandings might be re moved 1 As matters are now, both parties are in the hands of mercenary native agents, spies who have a great temptation to get up-sensation re ports to magyiify and distort statements. Already we see the evil effects of this in the absurd ru mours which have been brought by some of these native agents, men who -know nothing of international policy, but who take up the bazar M gup.' The only w T ay to meet this is by having consuls in Central Asia who will furnish reports on their own responsibility, but that cannot be done until Central Asia is more settled. With such rulers as there are in Bokhara and Kokand, no agents-of any kind would be safe, they might now be flayed alive. The reports of these native agents get into the native papers in India and mislead very much. Next to having responsible agents the best thing to meet intrigue would be by information. The natives are grossly ignorant regarding Russia—they fancy for instance, because she is a power with immense territory that she is therefore-strong, though in Siberia she has only a population of three millions. They have no idea of the weakness of her financial condition, of her feebleness in an aggressive war against a power like England and of the many causes which must make a .pacific policy her interest for many years. With them '\i is omne ignolum pro riiag~ nifieo. The sooner the bugbear of the im mense aggressive .power of Russia is dispelled the better for the interests of India. The Ind ian authorities ought not to be indifferent to this. If false reports and incorrect information are constantly circulated without contradiction people somehow come to believe them. A common error among the Muhammadans for instance is that Russia would prop up the Moslem power. The Bokhara people will soon find their mistake in this, but the simplest acquaintance with Russian history would show, that ever since the day when Russia drove the Tartars out of Moscow the career of Russia has been invariably one of anta gonism to the Moslems. The same doom im pends over the Mussulman power in Central Asia at the hands of Russia as awaited the Algerines from the French. The Russians are on the Oius, and while .no statesman would propose an intervention such as the unfortunate Cabul one—yet may notthesteps they are taking to secure a good military posi tion there, he in the end subservient to the inter ests of England, who, secure behind the barriers of the Himalayas, can calmly look out on the waves of discord rolling on in Afghanistan. Rus sia will have to spend large sums of money on those turbulent races of Central Asia, and when after a long struggle she lias tranquillised them may she not be only preparing the way at her own heavy expense for English trade in Central Asia, opening out the Oxus to our mer chants, and making a channel for civilization and Christianity to flow through High Asia, she having to pay the costs while we reap the fruits ? While theirs is the outlay ours may be the profit. Her armies may be the pioneers to level the last bastions of Moslem pride in Asia. You lately stated the important fact—'The carrying trade of Russia seems to be in the hands chiefly of foreigners. Last year of 2,022 vessels which arrived at St. Petersburg only 97 were under the Russian flag, the remainder belonging to 17 other nations, among them being 1,068 British. Last year 9 Russian and 6 English vessels sailed from Cronstadt to the Aynnv ' 1 myself Crimean war English merchants and agents met with no molestation but were treated as friends Mich ell in his valuable work, 'The liussian* in Central Asia,'' confirms this view. He writes ;— ' The security and development of the Russian trade in Central Asia must eventually benefit England. Bokhara at -present supplies Russia with cotton, dried fruit and other goods, and im ports their value from Russia, half in hardware, wooden boxes and coarse prints and half in specie. That specie is all that the Central Asiatics have to offer in return for English manufactured goods, which they highly esteem, but which they cannot buy with their inferior products. As prosperi ty coming in the wake of tranquillity becomes more general in the plains of Turkestan, so will the demand for English manufactures, and the means of purchasing them, now almost absent, become available.'* Trade is a pacifier and makes nations better acquainted. Russians and English work together in harmony at Pekin, they co-operate in the settlement tff the difficulties in Greece. An eminent English statesman well acquainted with Russia has asked the question —' The English and Russian empires, from the inevitable force of circumstances and their unavoid able expansion, must approach on the frontiers of India, why should not their respective subjects meet as friends ?' Grant Duff M. P., one of the leading liberals of England, in an ablearticle inth^ 81st number of the North British Review entitled ' Russia under Alexander II.,' pntSTjrward V;- following prop' iition well des-ervi g .v-O'^ion :— ' The Governments ot England and Russia ought to be not rivals but a support-to each Other in Asia, Neither of us can hurt the other s fi ious- ly except by exciting insurrection among our respective subjects or stimulating the'hostility of the tribes conterminous to our bordeis « policy must react against the pover that uses ior against both the cry of religion in danger and the cry for independence could easily he raised. 1 ' By the principle of' unavoidable expansion' we are come to be neighbours.

LONDON LETTER London, March IS. The Reform Bill h as been very coldly receiv ed. It has been throughout the week the sing'-o topic of conversation, and even now it is difti cult to understand which way public opinion tends. The papers are for once useless as indi cators. The Times dislikes the Bill, but then the Times, upon points, reflects Mr. Lowe. The liberal dailies support it, but reluctantly, and the liberal weeklies, which are more independent both of parties and of non-electors, are openly opposed. 1 do not think the provisions of the bill in themselves -excite much hostility, bat there is a general feeling that they furnish no grounds for a settlement, and a general arvioy- ance that no settlemeut should have be v. se cured. The Tories intend to avaii themselves of this lateut irritation, and h-.v^ iecided .to j, . •••ier&lt;t.tfcojm|^^ding of the ,, ou 12Ui April • i. _U' adment to the tc c t iirrge*^ Uiiment to the OUSA-''THE FRIEND OF INDIA. [A piul 19, 1866. / i i- quafitjon,' They believe that although in a mi nority they wi'l be joined by fourteen or fifteen discontented persons who, like Mr. Lowe, want office and dread democracy, and that forty or fifty more liberals, county members, crotchetty members, and excessively rich men who have no fear for their seats, will stay away from the divi sion. In that case they will win, and the Go vernment will be superseded either by a Tory Ministry, or by Mr. Gladstone. I am informed that the former is the more probable, Mr. Glad stone thinking that tLe Liberals need a year or two of opposition to brace their minds, and feel ing that there is no other way of getting rid of old men who now load down the party. He must go into dock to get rid of the barnacles. On the other hand, should the Tories fail they will fight the bill in Committee inch by inch, and try to make it conservative by either raising or lowering the county franchise, and by contend ing for £8 as the borough limit.. The action of the Lords need not be very gravely considered^ If the bill passes the Lower House by a majority of more than, ten they will accept it, and if not, not. Individually my impression is that the bill will not pass, but the members of the Government seem coufident, and there is a whisper that a section of the Tories will refuse to follow Mr. Disraeli, arguing that if this bill is thrown out there is jj-e to be agitation lor another and much more dangerous one. Nearly a month how ever hais still to elapse, and within that month fifty things may happen—Earl Russell may die, or King William of Prussia may have made up his ( mind to war, or the Fishery question in Canada may have produced such heart-burnings as to make war imminent with America. In any of these cases the bill will drop, and indeed as its opponents are enthusiastic and its friends luke warm almost any accident will be sufficient. Supposing the bill,to pass without the Savings Bank clause, which was doomed from the first night, its effect will probably be considerable. The workmen gain the control of about 159 seatf=, and though they may not all pull together they certainly will elect none but the strongest liber als. The counties too will be decidedly liberal ized. The new constituency will be composed almost exclusively of small occupiers, villa re sidents, professional men and upper tradesmen, and in many counties the unrepresented bor oughs will be masters of the field. The six metropolitan counties, Lancashire, Warwickshire, Somersetshire, and every county in which there are places like Tunbridge Wells, will return li berals, and in the next Parliament the Tories as a pai ty will probably be extinct,. Of course a uew Conservative paity will form itself pretty lapidly, but as yet -its oases are imperceptible, and indeed they must in any case depend great- !/ upon the action of the liberals. There may be a cry for direct taxation, or for the abolition of primogeniture, or for great ecclesiastical changes, or for radical reform in Ireland, or for a spirited foreign policy, but no politician will venture to say that he sees the precise point up on which the struggle will turn. All he is sure of is that it will not be the ' sacredness' of pro perly, on which the lower class is very nearly as bigoted as the upper, except when deluded by the theory that realized wealth ought to support the entire burden of tho State. An impot pro- grettif is possible in England but not a compul- aory subdivision. A latent feeling that changes under any suffrage will be very gradual influences all parties, and helps to produce the languor ob served in all reform debates. Mr. Lowe, to be sure, talked as if England were an egg set up on its end to be a^cked over by the first breath of - b)it peoulc see tliafc this/vjsJ^-* v %ik why J/- 4iCL.wel It is said that in the event of the Tories ob taining power Mr. Disraeli will be created a peer, Viscount Hughenden, and sent as Ambassador to Paris, a post he would fill well. A large section of his own party dislike him excessively, and he has two permanent disqualifications for his post as leader of the Conservative opposition. He is absolutely without inventiveness as witness his India Bill, and he is perpetually trying small dodges to secure temporary ends, now coquetting with Mr. Bright, now conciliating ultramontanes, and again milking absurd bids for tte support of the clergy, acting in fact aa if he thought policy a means to votes and not votes a means to se cure a polic}'. Many Tories, perhaps a majority, believe that unless Mr. Disraeli can be shelved it is useless to struggle for power, and in such cases a statesman however powerful must some times obey the party mandate. It seems clear that the Reform Bill is Earl RuSsell's. Mr. Gladstone in introducing it made a speech absolutely without reference to princi ples of any kind, devoted himself to details and treated these details too much in the style of the minor chapters in a budget. He left the im pression that he did not like the bill, and was- simply acting as the mouthpiece of a Cabinet which had arrived at the bill by a process of ex haustion, rejecting every suggestion as it came till the absolute necessity of doing something made them light upon seven pounds in the boroughs, and double that figure for the coun ties. No other member of the Government has yet spoken except Mr., Villiers who simply rapped at Mr. Lowe. Mr. Goschen was to have spoken but did not, and Sir George Grey who really un derstand# the question did not open his mouth. The debate therefore was on the whole poor, but both sides will gather up their loins for the con test on 12th April, and we shall probably have some sharp encounters., A good deal of apprehension is entertained here as to the position of affairs in Central Eu rope. The Prussian Government having dis- as Hayti and Cuba could hold them all, but Florida, which is hardly culturable by white men,, may be added to be governed by a white govern or as a territory. The popular impression in India, that the South cannot be cultivated by white labour, is a delusion arising from our ignor ance as to the capacities of an acclimatized white race, and the cruelty of expulsion will unfortun ately not strike the Americans, who though a kindly people seem more affected by antipa thies of colour than any race except the Chinese. This is the far future, but on the immediate future no opinion can be worth anything. My own is that the South will not be admitted unless it agrees that the unenfranchised popula tion shall not count in deciding the number of representatives, and that the struggle between the President and Congress will last till the next elections, (November) when the freeholders will issue their final decree., T. MILITARY LETTER. Iv London,. March 19. After much agitation the Military authorities have come to the resolution of not confining the distribution of the unattached Lieutenant-Col onelcies and majority which the Reductions will place at their disposal to the regiments now on the home establishment, in which it is necessary to strike off two Companies. These promotions are for the Infantry generally, and they will be offered to the Senior Majors and Captains until they are all taken up. This is a wise course,although no doubt it will give some additional trouble at the Horse-Guards and will probably delay the promotions themselves owing to the necessitv of commuuicating with officers at a distance. But BP of g ivil) g a J1 ' a j or or Captain a step missed its Parliament must have the Duchies to » , , , , , misbeu iw. t . i.- _ of rank merely because his reg;ment happens to compensate its people, and has told Austria so. The Kaiser Aoes not oppose, but as Holstein is e his, he demands territorial compensation. There upon. Count von Bismark threatens war under the belief that Austria will immediately retire, but the menace wounds the pride of the Haps- burgs, and the Kaiser quietly calls a confer ence of Marshals to decide on plans of defence should the Prussians begin to move. The Count would go farther and fight, but the king feels the war would be general and hesitates, and there the matter stands. A very slight step forward on either side would now lead to blows, but it is just possible that step' may, not be taken, Prussia fearing lest the result should be the final loss of her trans-Rhenan possessions. If war broke out Napoleon would join the weak er with the frontier of the Rhine as payment for his assistance. Individually I cannot believe in actual hostilities, but the Hapsburgs are not squeezable people, and Count von Bismark squeezes very hard. The news from America is curious. To judge by appearances the President has won, the South will be re*admitted, and society there will be re built upon the basis of serfage. I have never however judged American politics by external appearances, and my own conviction is that the apparent popularity of the President is a delu sion, that the freeholders who in the long run govern the Union will not endorse his action, that the South will be kept out sternly, and that if admitted there will be another struggle, pro bably upon the question of paying the^debt, which will produce another civil war. The North must win whether the struggle is at the polls or in the field and will then end the question fin- at home, was too manifest to allow the fnbt arrangement to stand. As at present fixed, 1 be lieve the plan to be adopted will be this. Tll^r'' oldest Major serving with a regiment will be of fered an unattached Lieutenant-Colonelcy ;if he accepts it the Senior Captain of the Army will be put into his majority. Should that Captain belong to a reducible regiment at home the eleventh Captain.(the first liable to half-pay) will fail into his place ; should he on the other hand belong to a regiment abroad, with the establish ment or which it is not intended to interfere, his Company will be filled by the transfer thereto of a junior Captain from a regiment abolit to be reduced. When the 30 Senior Line Captains hare thus been given tho majorities left vacant by the promotion of 30 Majors to Lieutenant Col onelcies, the next 30 will be offered the minor advantage of unattached majorities, and when these are accepted 60 of the supernumerary Captains will have been provided for either in their own or in some other regiments. The re* maining 22, as I have already informed you, will be kept on until, first a death takes place among those senior to him, or seeoyid a full pay or half pay retirement, or third two re* tirements of Captains or senior officers by the sale-of their Commissions. In this last case, that is to say when the next Captain but one sends ia his papers, the Government will give him his £1,800, or such portion of it as he may be en titled to from service and purchase combined out of the resorve fund. No promotion will take pk»e, -^epro race e ither [ ^ Captain will fall into hie ■S-H'- iiai, Of course the Gove^if rusual / X7A pril 19, 1866.] THE FRIEND OF INDIA. 459 this fact will make officeiwintending retirement less likely to oblige them. But officers in this position, unless they cau aftord to be very patient in the way of holding on, are at the inevcy of the authorities. An exchange is not likely to be avail able, for men do not like to come in as super- numeraries with their names in italics at the bottom of the list. So it will, be with the super abundant Lieutenants. They will remain on until a retirement in their own rank takes place, when the retiring Lieutenant being paid out of the reserve fund, and no Ensign being promoted in this rank, the extra payment or rather the want of it is not so likely to cause delay, as few men enter the service who are not prepared to experience such a loss as the £100 or £150 generally given beyond the regulation price for a lieutenancy.. The novelty in the Military world during the last few days has been the Queen's visit to A'ldershottv She drove in an open carriage from Windsor on one of the coldest East-windy days we have experienced this year, and before she got back to the castle she must have gone over 50 miles of ground. She looked very well, was in high spirits and most affable to the staff. There were a smaller number of troops to show her than ha^ been collected at Aldershott for several years. The r4th Hussars had gone oft to Hounslow a week before and the 31-st to Ports mouth on the previous day only. Consequently besides the artillery and—I beg pardon—the Military Train, the only regiments on the ground were the 3d and 8th Hussars, and the 13th, 17th, i2d, 63d, 69th aud 71st. This was one Cavalry and three infantry regiments below even the usual winter strength. However, in a few weeks the Camp will begin to fill rapidly. The 17th Lan cers reinforce the Cavalry Brigade this week, aud the 15th Hussars will follow about the end of next month. The Slst move up from Ports mouth to-day, the 66th will change from Devon- port as soon as the 70 th from New Zealand make their number. The 89th and 48th from Shorn- clitt'e will follow before long^ although I know not by what regiments they are to be re lieved—not, it is to he supposed, the 40th, 43rd or 68th from New Zealand. Possibly the 80th or 1st Bdttaliou-lSth from India may succeed them in that lesser and less disagreeable camp. The regiments arrived or immediately expected from foreign service are to be quartered as fol lows—44th at Dover, 64th and 56th at Gosport and Portsmouth, 70th at Devonport and 72nd at Edinburgh. The men of the last named regiment are said to be suffering much from the cold in Edinburgh Castle. It is quite ettled at the Quarter-Master Gen eral's Office that no Indian Reliefs will be sent on from the Colonies next year, and thus the con templated move of the 2-25th from Ceylou is abunduued. The following battalions are warned to be ready for embarkation in July—'-the 2nd Battalion Royals, 1st Battalion 2nd Queen's, 1st Battalion 3id Buffs, 1st Battalion 5th Fusiliers, aud 37th Regiment. The order has come by surprise upon the last named corps which had looked forward with certainty to a stay at home till 1867. Since my last the death of a well known Indian General has been announced, Lieuten- ant-General Archibald Brown Dyce has died at Southampton in the 66th year of his age. The deceased served in 1822 with the force sent to Ghersetty. In 1824 he served in the Burmese war as Brigade-Major to the 5th Madras Brigade with the column under Brigadier-General Morri son in Arracan. He commanded the 6th Madras Native Infantry, with the field force employed in Goomsoor, in 1837. He commanded the Chica- cole Light infantry with the force under Major- General Wilson at Adotli in 1838, and was se lected to command the field force unctei^he spe- ' cial or ders of t hj Fu.'iticul C omm iasi. vvab of Kuruoo'i ' action at Shorapore 18th October, 1839, and was thanked by the Government, and was presented by the officers of that corps with the sword of the captured Nawab. He also held the com mand of the 14th Madras Native Infantry in China in 1842. In 1847, in consequence of the rebellion in Goomsoor, he was selected to com mand the Northern Division, with the rank of Bligadier-General, and vested with full po litical authority in the disturbed districts ; and,, on the suppression of the outbreak, re* ceived the thanks of the Government. By his death, the following Army promotions will take place. Major-General C. R. Bowers to have the rank of Lieutenant-General ; Major- General Sir Robert Garrett,. K. C, P., Col onel of the 43rd Light Infautry, to be Lieuten- ant-General on the establishment ; Colouel J. R.. Brunker, Inspecting Field-Officer at Bristol, to be Major-General ; Major Philip Dickson, half pay Royal Artillery, to be Lieutenant-Col onel ; and Captain Augustus Davies, 74th High landers, to be Major in the Army. Sir R. Gar rett's promotiofi to the rank of Lieutenant-Gen eral will not cause him to vacate the command of the South Eastern District until probably early in 1867.

They think that the object of these exhibitions is to ascertain their ability to pay new taxes. Believing that rarity and not general usefulness was required iu the articles sent, they wished to exhibit abnormally formed chil dren and cattle.

' Hav ing been requested ,to lay down a rule as to the floral ornamentation of Churches, I would advise that, when ever such ornamentation is desired, the custom till late ly prevailing in this diocese be adhered to. No one, I believe, would object to simple decoration as distin guished from devices and symbols. These, whether floral or otherwise, I would exclude. Nor should any floral decoration appear on or about the Holy Table. In making this exception I do not differ from the late Bishop of London, and other authorities in matters of ritual.' This will at least prevent the possibility of any future collision between the Bishop and his clergy in open church during service. — Like most of the financial institutions called into existence by the Bombay cotton wealth the Bank of Guzerat is in a bad way. It was established by Mr. Premchund Roychund who has been forced by the searching criticisms of the Bombay Gazette to otter an explanation which, that journal declares, makes the matter worse. It seems that Mr. Premchund paid two-thirds of the capital for Port Canning shares which the Bank made over on credit to the house of Cama, which afterwards failed.
