Hir, 1 have the honour to submit the following resume of our relations with the Upper lafai tribe of the Aden protectorate, with my recommendations thereon, for consideration and sanction if approved. di . Gultan Kahtan bin Oraer entered into treaty relations witli us in 19o5, and was granted nn annual stipend of ts.IHuL. hile Khhtan was in vcien for t ie - purpose of signing the treaty, his brother daleh bin Oiaer took possession of the family M har” and deprived our stipendiary of his position as leader. Govern ment decided to help Gultnn l ahtan and gave him a present of dollars 300Q to assist him in regaining his position, but his efforts although continued throughout his life were unavailing. The Government of India considered it desirable to uphold Viira so as to counteract Turkish influence in our Protectorate. ^ultan Lahtan died in September 1T13 and his a son Gmer succeeded to his clairs but it was realised at the time that as long as Saleh bin Oraer remained in possession of the family’s ’’uar' 3 ahtan’s son Omer would, like his father remain a claimant only. i&gt;ut the alternative, to throw him overboard and to recog nise w&gt;aleh bin Gmer could not at that time be considered as it would have put a premium on the latter’s pro- /Turco-Islamic? ^urco-Iajltimic proclivities, ij^leh bii^Craer h^d more over not approached us with his claim to the succession nor whs it considered likely that he would do so, as he had held the allegiance of at least oiie half of the tribesmen and the de facto leader-ship of the tribe since the date that Kahtan visited Aden in l^Ub and there w*a no sicn that Omer bin Kahtan would prove more successful than his father in asserting his rights. it was, therefore, recommended that if the Government were prepared to put up with the stake of affairs that had been in vogue since the late Gultan Kahtan 1 s deposition (l) his son Omer be given a period of grace to rehabilitate himself, say for one year, and the stipend be paid to him, or (ii) Galeh be ignored as wad done in the lifetime of Kahtan, fVv as Galeh’s adherents were pro-Turkish or pro-Islamic and to substantiate this by recognition of Omer bin Kahtaiu’s claim to the Gultanate. The Government of India agreed to both these proposals. lights have continued between trie two parties, but our nominee has failed to establish his superiority over his uncle. During the war, however, SultM Gale* made overtures to us and considering the advantages to be gained by alienating him from the Turks, he was encouraged by this icesidency. Gultaxy/proveu his borta fides and stood by us loyally. he was pro-Turk and pro-Imam at one time but is not so any longer. The consensus of opinion in Yafa has always been that unless the two rivals were reconciled, there will be construit trouble in that quarter. Both parties wer * therefore asked to come to terms, a* to continue bolster up a dead cause was clearly of no avail *nd /weTrr-v, v#e had to scc^pt, the conditions of to-day. h. after protracted negotiation* the rivnla agreed to be reconciled on the following condition* (1) Suit an Saleh bin o^ter to be acknowledged a* the Sultan of the Upper Yafai*, 'ind to receive the stipend hitherto paid to the 'de Jure' Sultan Omer bin KaWNen. (2) Sultan Omer to pay dollars 4000 as blood- money compensation to the heirs of the people killed in the fights between the two parties. (o) Sultan Omer -nd his relative* to return to the fa illy M wuere ••ultan Saleh and his sons will also reside. (4) That the Government be requested to double , the stipend in view of the extra expenditure that will henceforth be necessary. 6. From the above it will be noticed that Sultan Saleh scores all through, which further proves hi* stability. There is no objection to our fornal recognition of him as Sultan and transfer of the exist ing stipend to his name, and i would recommend that this be done. As regard* the payment of blood-money our late nominee has nothing wherewith to satisfy this part of the bargain. Although there is nothing on paper he appears to have been promised the amount by Lieut.-Colonel Wood, G.X.L., late First Assistant iiesident, as a basis for the negotiations, and this promise it is incumbent on the Government now to fulfil. it is therefore requested that sanction may b# accorded to the payment of 4QC0 dollars (M.T.) to the parties concerned. With reference to item 4, 1 an of opinion that since the new oultan is to be recipient of the stipend in future, we should not altogether desert Gmer after having backed him and Vila father ao long. An / animalannu?il stipend of is. 600 will meet the c^se, which is recommended for aonction. v,* Although on the face of it, the eettiement Hppe&amp;rs to be a one-sided arrangement, and the Oovern- rnent is called upon to p»y a heavy sura to get it» protege to aciaiowledge his rival as the *de facto* and *de jure* sultan, the only benefit acciruino tc. nira being permission to return to the ancestral *i&gt;ar, * yet from a political point of view it should be very satisfactory as it should put an end to an extreraely unsatiafactory condition of affairs, atop inter-tribal warfare within fafai boundaries, gain a strong partisan and remove him from the temptation of coquetting with the imam. b. \ copy of this letter h s been forwarded to the hovernraent of Bombay, political I'epartmont, wd the government of India, Foreign bepartmont. i have the honour to be, dir, ur most obedient servant, (signed) o. v. a.

Sir, \ With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No.5362, dated the 12th September 1913, I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, that Sultan Kahtan bin Umar of Upper Yafa died on the 26th idem. His son Umar bin Kahtan writes to say that he has succeeded his father, and expresses his hopes that Government will confirm him in his father’s position, i.e., continue to him the yearly stipend of Rs.1,200. Sheikh Abdul Rehman bin Kasim, the Uuflahi; Mahomed and Utaar Muthana, the Bthubie, and Mohsin bin Askar, the Nakib of Mausatta, all 'stipendiaries of ours, have also written to me confirming the report of Sultan Kahtan’s death and recommending that ;his son Umar may be accepted as the rightful successor. 2. As long as the late Sultan Kahtan*s brother, Saleh bin Umar, remains in possession of the family’s H Bar , ‘ (head quarters) his son Umar will, like his father, remain a figure head. At the same time to throw him over board and to recognise Saleh bin Umar will put a premium on the latter’s pro Turko-Imamic proclivities. Saleh he? not yet approached me with his claims for succession nor do I think he will do so, for ever since Kahtan*s deposition in 1903 his brother Saleh h*® held the allegiance of almost one half of the tribesmen. He has further more been collecting his brother’s dues and his xrrival’s death will not diminish his gains, unless Kahtan*s son Umar proves : himself the stronger. It would then be oolitic to waitand watch to which side the general feeling in Upper ^5, Yafa fluctuates. If Government are prepared to put up with the state of affairs that has been in vogue since the late Sultan Kahtan's deposition - and I do not see what else we can do at this distance - I would suggest one of two alternatives (1) that his son Onar he given a period of grace to rehabilitate himself, say one year, and that the stipend he paid to him provisionally or (2) that we ignore Saleh now as we did in Kahtan’s life~ time and substantiate by recognition Dinar 1 s claims to the Sultanate. The latter course appears to be more politic. Our friendly stipendiaries in Yafa urge this course: Saleh 1 ® adherents are pro-Turkish or pro-imam. I have, etc., Sd/- J. A.

In reply, I am to say that, in the circumstances stated the Government of India agree with the Governor in Council that it would be advisable to continue for the present our support to Ulnar.

In that letter the Government of India expressed the view that, for reasons given, the better policy was to continue recognition of Sultan Kahtan. The papers were forwarded to the Political Resident at Aden for further report, but no change in the position occurred until May when the Resident had an int e rview with certain representatives of the Yaffai, on the 17th of that month, of w hich I am to attach a note.

On a consideration of the promises made at that interview, the Resident was told that if he ^vas satisfied that Sultan Kahtan’s position with the Yaffai tribe had been re-established to the extent contemplated at the time the pay ment was promised, he was authorised to pay down the remaining moiety of 3,000 dollars promised to Sultan Kahtan as due alter his re-entry into his dar, the payment of which was discussed in the accompaniments of my letter of hp • .... December 1905[] above referred to and * Pr ”' No - 171 had been intended to enable him, by pay- ment of blood money, to effect a reconciliation and re-establish himself in the position he held when he first came down to Aden. 84. I am now to submit, for the information of the Government of India, the Resident’s No. 5046, dated the 24th August 1906, in which he reports that he is satisfied with Kahtan’s position owing to the reconciliation with Haidara, and has therefore paid the amount which he promised on the 17th May, and that he is also paying Kahtan’s stipend at the rate of Rs. 2 per dollar, subject * Pro. No. 103 in External a., August 1901 , Nos. to the understanding mentioned in the 102-103 Government of India letter* of the 6th August 1901. 5 . I am in conclusion to say that no further move will be made in regard to the relations with the Yaffai tribes, pending the final orders of the Secretary of State on the general policy to he followed, but it appeared to His Excellency the Governor in Council imperative to make good these pre-existing promises. Note of an interview held on the 17th May 1906 between Major-General E. Be Brath, Eolitical Resident, Aden, and Sultan Muhammad bin Manassar and other representatives oj the Upper Yaffai tribe. Resident interviewed (1) Sultan Muhammad bin Manassar, Kahtan’s cousin, (2) Kahtan’s son Umar, (3) Manassar bin Alawi of Haidara’s faction and (4; a nephew of Kahtan. They produced an agreement entered into between Kahtan and Haidara and duly attested, and on this they wanted the Resident’s imprimatur. Sultan Ahmed Eadthl of Lahej was also to he consulted and it was understood that he had a hand in promoting the project (owing doubtless to his matrimonial alli ance in the Maussata clan). The bond was recited in detail. It will be sufficient to say that by it all things were to be in common between the two scions of the house of Sheikh Ali, Harhara, including a stipend not by any means that now enjoyed by Kahtan, but another and prospective one it was contemplated that Government w r ould grant to Haidara. The quartette made it clear that after this re-union things would work smoothly in that country, and Government would then be wel comed there. The Resident congratulated them on the good friendship evinced between the two, at one time irreconcilable, representatives of the house of Sheikh Ali Harhara, but made it clear that the arrangement was purely a private one and further required no seal or imprimatur from himself. If, however, the union of the two Sultans meant the rehabilitation of Kahtan, our nominee, he would be pleased to ask Government at once to pay down the moiety of the $3,000 promised to Kahtan as due after his re-entry into his dar, and that as regards further assistance in the way of arms and money, as suggested by the party, Government would prefer to have some anterior and visible demonstration of the power which the proposed re-union promised to exercise. After Kahtan’s re-installation, the Resident would advise the desirability of Haidara’s inclusion in the list of stipendiaries and would further consider the question of arms and ammunition. The party said they would journey to Lahej and there await Government’s decision, which the Resident reminded them could not be expected earlier than the lapse of two months’ time. 2 . They then spoke of ‘Ali Mohsin’ Askar and asked if they might recall him to our allegiance. Further, would the Resident ask the Amir to use his influence in his recall. The Resident replied that as ‘ Ali Mohsin had gratuit ously insulted the Political Agent and committed an unfriendly act on the border, the first step lay with him. We 9.could do without his services, hut if he spontaneously returned, the question of liis pardon would be considered, hut might be refused. Muhammad bin Manas- sar said that he and that Sheikh were once good friends and so he hoped he might be allowed to address ’Ali Mohsin. The Resident said that so long as he worked as from himself, there was no objection. II. P. JACOB, Major, Political Agent, D*thala. No. 5046, dated Aden Residency, the 24th August 1906.

It appears that shortly after the conclusion • 8ab-.ocio.nre to Pro. Ko. 181 io s^ret B, Ma, of Protectorate Treaty * with Sultan 1904, Nos. 153-203. Kahtan m October 1903, it came to the t Enclosure to Fro. No. lea m ibid.. notice of the Residency Officials that the Sultan, who had been deposed f during his absence in Aden, would not be able to reinstate himself amongst his tribesmen without some pecuniary assist ance from Government to enable him to pay blood money in satisfaction of 10certain deaths which took place in the fighting that ensued between him and liis brother shortly after his deposition and to incur other expenses to conciliate his tribesmen. The then Political Officer at D 5 thala (Major Merewetber) appears to have promised him a sum of 3,000 dollars for this purpose. Apparently the Resident proposed to give this amount as a debit against his grant for ‘ Darbar Presents * and the 3,000 dollars were withdrawn from the Treasury and 3&lt;ept in deposit with the Political Officer at D’thala for ready payment. These matters were only reported to Government in the Resident’s letter No. 370, dated the 22nd January 1905, and I am to attach a copy of the resolution which issued thereon. A moiety of these 3,000 dollars had'apparently already been paid to Sultan Kahtan in December 1904, as appears from Captain Jacob’s * Sub-enclosure to Pro. No. 474 in Secret E., June report * of 30th August 1905, copy of which was submitted to the Government ^ , Ti , „„ , of India with my letter f No. 8301, dated the 22nd December 190o. The fnrther history of the matter has been fully reported for the information of the Government of India in my letter No 241-P., dated the 15th September 1908. There appears to have been no prompt report by the Resident of Sultan Kahtan\s difficulties after the treaty had been negotiated nor does the omission appear to have attracted attention when the report of January 1905 was received by Government.

J I have the honour to report that the Budget grants for this Residency for the current year under “ Entertainment of Chiefs and Envoys ” and “ Darbar Presents” are Rs. 11,000 and Rs. 39,000, respectively. Under the former head the recorded expenditure up to 31st December 1904 amounts to Rs. 11,124-9-1, showing an excess of Rs. 124-9-1, while under the latter the expenditure up to the same date has reached the sum of Rs. 29,907-3-2, leaving a balance of Rs. 9,092-12-10. It will he seen that the average expenditure under Entertainment, (fee.” is Rs. 1,236, while that under “ Darbar Presents ” is Rs. 3,323. Eor the remaining three Monthly average 3,323 *6 o months of the financial year, therefore, it xs will be necessary to have for “ Entertain- Por three months ... 9,969 0 0 ^nmit Rs, 3, / 08, together with Rs. 124- Balance iu hand 9,(k&gt;2i2io 1-9, the excess expenditure already in- ~ 876 3 2 curred, thus making a total of Rs. 3,832- , ^ _ 1 ' 9 » or in figures Rs. 4,000, and R 1 000° ar ^ resen ^ S * '^' S ' ^ ^ as s k owrL the margin, or in round figures Besides there is a special advance of 3,000 dollars (Rs. 4,260) to the Political Officer, D’thala, which is intended to be given to Sultan Kahtan bin Umr Harhara. This amount is being given to enable Sultan Kabtan to regain ms Dar and to pay up some blood money amounting to about $2,000, as otherwise I was given to understand by Major Mere wether that Sultan Kabtan would not be able to re-establish himself amongst the tribesmen. Provision will have to be made for this under “ Darbar Presents.” The additional allotment of Rs. 1,000 asked for above will therefore have to be raised to Rs. 5,300. ooh, tCt 1 , e f plained m my TOnfidentia 1 letter No. 197, dated the 29th November 1904, that entertainment and presents are claimed by the tribes as a matter of right and though every effort is being made to disabuse their 1112 e 'S e p a s e I 0 s f t 1 r J t 1 r minds of this idea the notion seems to die hard. The Chiefs and their followers fcierefore still continue to come in for what they deem their “ dues.” I enclose herewith a statement* showing the names of the principal Chiefs who \isited Aden from time to time during the past nine months, and would particularly invite attention to the more important amongst them— (i) The Ahdali Sultan with a following of 25 men arrived in June 1904 to hid farewell to General Maitland before his departure from Aden on retirement, and to see at the same time the new Resident. He had to be entertained in a manner suitable to his rank, and given presents proportionate to his importance. (it) The circumstances under which the Eadthli Sultan was liberally treated have already been explained in my letter No. 412, dated the 30th December 1904. (Hi) Also the Amir of D’thala with a following of 24 men arrived at Aden to conclude a new treaty. In such instances the Chiefs and their followers are received and entertained in keeping with the importance of the occasion. 3. I would add that in applying for the extra grants, I have fixed the figures at the lowest limit, as I am at present taking advantage of the presence of plague in Aden and trying to dissuade the Chiefs and their followers from coming in, and it is hoped by economic management to make the amounts asked for meet all requirements.

Min y Let Unde Secre Come Unde SecreFrom The ASSISTANT SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA m the Foreign Department^ To J. J. HEATON, Esq., OFFICIATING CHIEF SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of BOMBAY, Politicax Department. Dated Fort William, the 16th February 1906. Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of the Hon’ble Sir Steyning Edgerley’s letter No. 8304, dated the 22nd December 1905, relative to the treaty with the Upper Yalfai. 2. The Government of India understand that the Bombay Government recommend that the treaty entered into with Sultan Kahtan in October 1903, should be denounced, and that an interval should be allowed to elapse before a new treaty is concluded with whatever individual, or individuals, may eventually be considered to possess most influence over the tnbe. I am to say that, in the opinion of the Government of India, the course proposed is not free from objection as long as the boundary question with the Turkish Govern ment remains unsettled; and in this connection, I am to transmit a c0 Py Secret despatch No. 130, dated the 24th July 1902, to the Secretary of State, in which the advantage from an international point of view of bemg m treaty relations with the Upper Yaftai is set forth in some detail. 3. Again, in the Secret despatch from the Secretary of State for India, No. 42, dated the 8th December 1905, a copy of which was forwarded to the Government of Bombay with the endorsement from this Department, No. 133 E.vB., dated the 12th January 1906, attention has been djawn to the necessity of proceeding with caution in the North-East districts of the Aden Hinterland, which have not yet been recognised by the Ottoman Government as being within the British sphere. The observations contained in this despatc have an application to the present case, since, though the Yanai are within the British Protectorate, the limits of their territory are somewhat undefined, and an international dispute might easily arise with reference to some portion of the area occupied by the tribe. Indeed, the fact reported in your letter No. 864, dated 31st January 1906, and its enclosure, that the Sheikhs of Rubeaten, which has been recognised as belonging to Yaffa, have received intriguing communications from the Mudir of Rada on behalf of the Turks, indicates how dangerous it might be to withdraw the direct treaty which we now have with Sultan Kahtan, whose appanage Rubeaten is said to be. 4. The Bombay Government bring to notice that Sultan Kahtan is no longer in a position to perform the obligations which he undertook, and which are set out in the treaty. The Governor-General in Council agrees that, if serious or repeated breaches of tribal engagements were shown to have taken place, and if Kahtan by reason of his deposition were unable to afford proper2 satisfaction in respect of such breaches, it might become necessary to recognise some other tribal leader. But from paragraph 7 of the Resident’s letter No. 6857, dated the 6th November 1905, it- would appear that neither Kahtan nor his fellow-tribesmen are chargeable at present with any specific violation of the terms of the treaty or with any positively improper conduct, and if this is so, it may he regarded as an additional reason in favour of allowing matters to remain as they now are, and for continuing payment to Kahtan of the small stipend which we are formally pledged to grant him as representative of the Upper Yaffai. 5. Captain Jacob, in his note of the 30th August 1905, indicates that Ali-hin-Mohsin Askar is not fulfilling the conditions under which his allowance was granted to him and I am to point out that, as this allowance is purely personal and conditional on his rendering satisfactory service, it might he desirable in the first instance to consider the probable effect of ceasing to pay any sum to him before taking action in regard to the regular stipend of Kahtan-bin-Omer, who, at any rate, was the titular Sultan of the Upper Yaffai, and is the brother of one of the Sheikhs, Saleh-bin-Omar, who is now put forward as one of the real leaders of the tribe. 6. In conclusion, I am to request that the matter may be considered further in the light of the above remarks, and that, if His Excellency the Governor in Council still adheres to his present opinion, the precise nature of the ill effects which it is anticipated will result from our continued recognition of Kahtan may be more clearly explained.

Yaffai. 2. I am to forward, for the orders of the Government of India, a copy of a letter No. 6857, dated the Cth November 1905, and of its enclosures, from the Political Resident, Aden, from which it will be seen that Sultan Kahtan does not occupy the position with his tribesmen which he was represented to possess when the treaty of October 1903 was concluded with him. He is evidently unable to fulfil his covenants with us and has lost any nominal position he held amongst the Yaffai. It is probably true that in the stress of boundary delimita tion persons coming forward as representing the tribe were too readily accepted at their own valuation. It will be seen that there is a divergence of opinion between Major Jacob and General Mason as to the best attitude to adopt. The latter is of opinion that it would be impolitic to abandon Sultan Kahtan at the present juncture. He suggests that the loss of his position by Sultan Kahtan was the direct outcome of his having entered into treaty relations with us and therefore recommends that the stipend of $ 50 per mensem now paid to him should be converted into a personal allowance. 3. His Excellency is inclined to believe that he could never have had more than a purely nominal position and that if he had really been a person of weio-ht m the counsels of the tribe his visit to Aden would not have led to the results attributed to it. His Excellency the Governor in Council thinks that it would .better therefore to intimate to Sultan Kahtan that Government treated with him as Chief and that, as he is not in a position to perform the oblio-ations he undertook, Government must recognize that fact and act accordino-ly i e consider the agreement with him at an end. It is for the Governmental India o consider whether anything in the shape of compensation should be paid to oultan Kahtan. His Excellency the Governor in Council is not inclined to4. As to the desirability of concluding a treaty with either Haidera bin Mahomed or Saleh bin Omar, who are reported to be men of great influence, I am to say that His Excellency the Governor in Council is inclined to recom mend that the Political Officers should wait to be approached. His Excellency thinks that the suggestions referred to in paragraph 6 ol the Resident s letter are altogether undesirable. Our relations with the Yaflai are altogether different to those with the Wahidi of Balahaf and have in the past been almost non-existent. It is preferable to wait and in the meantime Major Jacob should feel his way and make sure as to who is the person or persons whose influence over the tribe is most weighty and also endeavour to foster friendly relations with the tribe and so pave the way to some more material agreement.

Jacob, concerning the affairs of Sultan Kahtan bin Omar of the Upper Yaffai, 2, I have issued orders for the payment of YafFai stipends at the enhanced rate sanctioned in Government Hesolution No. 1370, dated the 1st March 1905, subject to the understanding therein prescribed and I have accepted Major Jacob’s suggestion to, for the present, withhold this concession from Sultan Kahtan. 3. As to the policy to be now pursued, it must of course be admitted that the present position under which our nominee continues to lack support and remains practically unrecognized and unrespected by his tribe is undesirable and pregnant with possible mischief. This office letter No. 224, dated the 2nd August 1903, first communicated the fact that Sultan Kahtan’s advances to the British Government had resulted in a sort of domestic revolution amongst his adherents and his practical deposition. It was hoped at that time that this was the work of only a section of the tribe and that Sultan Kahtan would be able to reinstate himself upon his return to his country. 4. It is not clear from the records whether he ever actually ma'le any real progress in that direction, but a treaty was concluded with him at D’thala in October 1903 and the fact was communicated to Government in this office letter JSo. 285, dated the 22nd October 1903. 5. Since then hostilities and differences have continued between Sultan Kahtan and his^brother Saleh bin Omar and hitherto Sultan Kahtan has failed to re-establish nimself in the position which he occupied before he first came to Adeu and the loss cf which was due to that visit. Incidental reference has been made to this petty warfare in this office letter No. 54, dated 2nd March ^1904, and in letter No. 6190, dated the 12th October last, Sultan Kahtan s deposition was also alluded to in explaining certain account objections m regard to the non-adjustment of the 3,000 dollars advanced to the Political Officer at D thala to assist Sultan Kahtan towards paying blood-money in satisfaction of certain deaths which took place in the fighting which ensued between him and his brother shortly after Sultan Kahtan’s deposition. 6. Colonel Scallon has left upon record his approval of the suggestion that the Balahaf precedent should be followed and that the Political Officer at Id tha a should now be authorized to summon to D’thala or to some other suitable place the leading Sheikhs and personages of the Upper Yaffai with a View to either the reinstatement of Sultan Kahtan or the election of some other Sultan. In the event of the decision being adverse to Sultan Kahtan, he was of opinion that the balance of deposit 1,500 dollars still with Major Jacob should be paid to him by way of compensation for the loss of prestige and position for which his connection with this Residency appears to have been primarily responsible. Colonel Scallon considered that this payment should bo made in hnal settlement of Sultan Kahtan’s claims upon Government. Q . ^ “ would a PP ear the most convenient under the circum stances, but it is I think a matter for consideration whether in view of the main awkward fact that Sultan Kahtan’s deposition was due to his acceptance of our Pol 1597—22 overtures such a course would be really politic. In the Balahaf case Government agreed to the election of Sultan Mohsin in place of Sultan Saleh bin Abdulla who had been formerly recognized but had subsequently proved weak and incompetent. But in that case there was the additional ground of Sultan Saleh bin. Abdulla having violated one of his treaty stipulations with the British Government which in the present case does not exist. 8. In the absence of some such additional ground it may be held that our abandonment of Sultan Kahtan at the present juncture would be impolitic and entail a certain loss of prestige on our part which it is desirable to, if possible, avoid. Major Jacob urges that it is impracticable and undesirable to enforce compliance with our will. But it is at least not impracticable to continue to him an allowance, his original receipt of which may be said to have cost him his throne. And 1 would suggest that possibly the simplest solution of the problem would be to now convert this into a personal allowance and to pr^ss tor a reconciliation of the brothers and the inclusion of either Saleh bin Omar or Haidera bin Mahomed or both as signatories to the treaty subsisting between us and the Upper Yaffai. 9. This will, of course, entail the necessity of stipends to the individual or individuals included, but it would seem to be the line of least resistance out of a distinctly awkward predicament. And I await the orders of Government before issuing fresh instructions in the matter to Major Jacob. Kahan bin Omar, Sultan Upper Yaffa. It is now nine months since, at my predecessors suggestion, $ 1,500 was h an (lml over to Ali bin Mohsin Askar who was to act as a medium in the rehabilitation of bultan Katitan and his re-entrance into his “ Bar. ” The moiety lies in my treasure chest. Satisfaction for deaths from the fighting which ensued over Kahtan’s deposition on the occasion of his visit at our instance to Aden to sign the treaty has not yet been made. The Sultan has many enemies and his restoration promised by Ali bin Mobsin within a couple of months has not been effected, nor is there any likelihood of this consummation. In the meantime Kahtan bin Omar is drawing a monthly stipend of $50 per month. He sends from time to time letters recommending his people for gifts, but these I consis tently dishonour in conformity with my reiterated refusal in writing to him to treat the recommendations of one who is certainly no de facto ruler and scarcely even a ruler dejure* Mv suggestion is that the balance of $1,500 be. forthwith paid to Kahtan and he be told that if in two months from this date he is still unable to appease his electors and be acclaimed once more by popular vote as Sultan, he has ipso facto no further claun on our support and must make way for another whose title is stronger. If he is ignored by his own he can no longer with any show of reason expect further recognition of his claims and I fail to see why we should continue to him month by month the payment of bis stipend. He is practically deposed by popular will and it is against every political principle to uphold one who has forfeited his electors’ confidence. We should lay ourselves open to the charge of forcing a ruler upon his unwilling subjects and be in danger of losing our prestige in Upper Yafa, which indeed is now a process in steady development when people see that we persist in Kahtan’s restoration and he as persistently remains deposed. To force compliance with our will is impracticable and undesirable, the alternative is to work along the line of the people’s choice and make it our own. It is incumbent on us to uphold the strongest man. We have a treaty with Kahtan as Sultan, but not with him as Kahtan We are pledged to support and finance him as long as he maintains his position. He is already deposed by his people and it is no breach of faith if, after due notice we fuspend the payment to him of a stipend. Such a threat will serve as an incentive to him to labour to retrieve his fortunes. Now he is toying with us while we get no return of our disbursements to him. It is only right to remark that our selection of Kahtan, and mdee that of many others of our stipendiaries there, was the result of an inordinate has e o prove to the Turks, who pretended to dispute our predommence m Upper Jaffa as one of the nine cantons, the fact of treaties already in being with its chiefs, and it is an °P e “ secret^hat we precipitated affairs in this country. It had been wiser to have cone uded some nexus with those whom the Turks before us had signalled out as the worthiest recipients of their doles. Their right band man was Sultan Haidara bin Muhammad and secondly. Saleh bin Omar, Kahtan’s brother. All these, it la true, were originally of the family of Sheikh Ali Barbara. I he house of Sheikh Ali was divided against itself, Kahtan3 took refnge with the Dthubi section, Haidara betook himself to the Maasata clan of whom the Askar family are of great repute and are scylod the “ fathers of Yaffa. To have selected as our nominee the Turkish choice would have been a sounder policy and have for ever defeated Turkish intrigue on that border. Now we shall be subjected to the probability of constant intrigue, flaidara is a man of great influence and should, I submit, with expediency be taken under our wing, more especially as we must for sometime continue to exercise control from a distance. The presence on the border of a strong and disappointed man is a weak and vulnerable spot in our line of defence. Recognise ivahtan as deposed by his people and replace a weak man by a strong and we shall be able to leave Upper Yaffa for a time without concern or anxiety. I may add that Haidara s father strongly favoured the British Government. The Turks were ever present on tn o ho ^ er and we were in Aden. Hence the Yaffai's coquetry with, and declension to, the lurks. Ihe Yaffai is a commodity merely. He belongs to the highest bidder. Ali bin Mohsin, our intermediary, is a vain and crafty person and at heart inimical to the one he is aftecung to reinstate. His aim is to win British favour, he is the soi-ditant light of the Upper Yalta country. I would in future totally ignore him and his pretensions to influence. He neither can, nor will, do honest work for us. Finally with regard to the proposal to pay the Upper Yaffa stipendiaries at the enhanced rate of a 2-rupee dollar, I would advocate this privilege and I have clearly notified to all the stipendiaries that the concession is one of pure grace and liable to withdrawal if a recipient ceases to render loyal service and should be granted from and after the 1st proximo to all save Sultan Kahtan bin Omer, and for the reasons above detailed. We shall thus be the better able to guage his worth and power, and this will be a further incentive to him to regain his “ Bar ” if indeed he be able to do so. (Signed) H. F.

Hancock, First Assistant Resident, Aden. Forwarded with compliments to First Assistant Resident for the consideration of the Resident. It is known that Colonel Scallon would prefer to postpone for a time the re-adjustment of Upper Yaffai politics, and I am in complete accord with him, but feel sure that we can with advantage now begin quietly, and from a distance, to move in that country on the lines I have indicated so as to be ready at a later date to pick up the threads and advance towards a more perfect consolidation of our interests on that north-east-frontier. /No. 3808, dated Bombay Castle, the 17th June 1905. From—The Hon'ble Mr. S. W. Edgerley, C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Govern ment of Bombay, Political Department, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to state, for the information of the Government of India, that the Accountant-General, Bombay, in submitting for sanction detailed bills of expenditure incurred by the Political Resident, Aden, duiing anuary 1905, pointed out that the sanction of tl e Government of India was neces sary to pass a monthly recurring charge of 7 dollars paid to Rashid Kasim on 'behalf of Sheikh* Mutahir Ali of ^ Ardaf on the Shaibi-Mares border, as an allowance for inspecting and guarding the boundary pillars in his country, from the 25th January to the 31st December 1904, ^ amounting in all to Rs. 105-4-5. The Political Resident, to whom the subject was referred for report, explains in his letter No. 2940, dated 21st May last (a copy of which is enclosed), that an agreement was entered into by the late Captain Warneford on the 4th October 1903, by which Sheikh Mutahir Ali was to receive a monthly stipend of 7 dollars in consideration of the assistance he had rendered to the British Government, and particularly for the preservation of the four boundary pillars on the borders. 2. I am to observe that the treaty with the Amir of Dthala provided for the preservation of the boundary pillars on the frontier line of his country, and that no arrangement has been sanctioned for the preservation of the pillars on the boundary line running north-east beyond his boundaries through the Shaibi-Mares country already demarcated. 3. In these circumstances, I am to request that, in view of the agreement above referred to, the Government of India may be moved to accord sanction to the charge amounting to Rs. 105-4-5, paid to Rashid Kasim on behalf of Sheikh Mutahir Ali, from 25th January to 31st December 1904, and to the charges on that account for future months. 4. As Captain Warneford is dead and General Maitland has retired, it is not possible to submit any explanation of the failure to report the agreement at the time for approval. His Excellency the Governor in Council, however, is of opinion that there is nothing objectionable in the agreement. No. 2940, dated Aden, the 21st May 1905. From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident at Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to paragraph 1 of Government Resolution No. 2025, dated the 29th March 1905, requesting me to explain the circumstances under which an allowance of seven dollars per mensem was paid to Rashid Kasim, on behalf of Sheikh Mutahir Ali of Abu Sahm-al-Ardaf in the country of Shaib, and enquiring why the previous sanction of Government was not obtained to its payment, the charge being one of a recurring nature, I have the honour to state that when Musaid Mutahir, the eldest son of the Chief of Ardaf, on the Shaibi-Mares border, visited Dthala in October 1903, the late Captain Warneford, who was then Political Officer, took the opportunity of suggesting to the Resident to give effect to the idea, which General Maitland then seemed to have entertained, regarding the future care of the boundary pillars, and is alluded to later on in 1904 in paragraph 8 of his confidential letter No. 76, dated the 2nd April 1904, on the subject of the new treaty with the Amir of Dthala, namely, to pay the local Sheikhs, on whose borders the pillars stand, a small sum for each pillar as long as it remained standing. General Maitland then agreed; and on Captain Warneford’s recommendation, it was /decided that Sheikh Mutahir Ali should he paid a sum of seven dollars per mensem in consideration of the assistance he had rendered to the British Government, and particularly the Aden Boundary Commission, and also mainly for the preservation of the four boundary pillars on his borders. An agreement to this effect was thereupon concluded on the 24th October 1903, and a copy of it is herewith enclosed for the information of Government. 2 . It would seem that, as this monthly allowance was paid from the Durbar presents, Captain Warneford did not deem it necessary to obtain the previous sanction of Government. However, as the Accountant-General con siders that the sanction of Government is necessary for the charges which have already been incurred, and which may be incurred hereafter, I have the honour to apply for the same. The Sheikh in question is, it is reported by the present Political Officer, pre-eminently a loyal friend of Government, and of no little importance, not alone in the Shaibi country, but also as a medium m our relations with the Upper Yaffai country, the friendship of whose Sheikhs and tribesmen it is the Political Officer’s prime duty closely to cultivate. Agreement between the Resident at Aden and the Sheikh Mutahir Ali of Ardaf in Skaib, regarding the care of the boundary pillars. The Resident will pay always to the Sheikh Mutahir Ali from the kind ness of Government the sum of dollars seven^ per mensem in token of the friendship and assistance rendered by the said Sheikh to the British^ Govern ment, and particularly to the Aden Boundary Commission. The said Sheikh agrees to always remain in friendship and obedience to the British Government and in assistance to its officers, and also that he will preserve and guard the boundary pillars that have been put up on the frontier of the said Sheikh’s country, and when they are damaged or broken that he will repair them.

To GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. • SECRET. External. The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BROBRICK, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. * Fort William, the 9th February 1905. Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 30 (Secret) of 15th July last, we * No. 7818, dated the 19th December 1904, with have the llOUOUr to transmit tO yOU a enclosure. copy of a letter* from the Government of Bombay, enclosing, together with their observations thereon, a report from the Political Resident at Aden, on the subject of our future relations with the tribes in the Aden Hinterland. The Bombay Government do not consider that it is practicable to adopt either of the definite proposals put forward by you for discussion, viz., that whether by the superior influence of the Sultan of Lahej, or by a clear under standing with each separate tribe, the Government of India should induce the tribes to come to an arrangement among themselves in the matter of common duties, such as the protection of their trade routes and the settlement of religious and inter-tribal disputes. They are also unable to propound any definite scheme for revising our relations with the tribes in such a manner as materially to diminish the chances of conflict and disturbance in the Hinterland. They are in favour, however, of advantage being taken of every opportunity as it occurs to treat the stipends of the Chiefs as a means of increasing our hold upon them. We agree generally with this recommendation, provided that it is clearly understood that increased subsidies involve on the part of the Chief additional and definite obligations, such as have been imposed upon the Amir of Dthala, by Article IX of the recent agreement; but would prefer to reserve a final expression of our opinion until we have had experience of the practical effect of the provisions of that Article. Upon the larger question of our relations with the tribes, we most readily assure His Majesty’s Government that there is no intention or desire on the part of the Government of India to extend their obligations towards the Chiefs, or to depart from the fundamental principles which have hitherto regulated our connection with them. Recent events have tended to develop this connec tion, and have unavoidably widened the sphere of our responsibilities. On the other hand not the least valuable of their results should be the opportunity now afforded to us of employing a means of conciliation hitherto untried in the Aden Hinterland, but very familiar on other parts of the frontier of the Indian Empire, namely, the personal influence of British Political Officers in2 close touch with the people under their charge. Few officers with the necessary local knowledge and qualifications have in the past been produced under the system hitherto regulating the relations of the Residency at Aden with the tribal Chiefs, but it may be hoped that, if a Political representative be perma- nently maintained at Dthala, this important factor will be broug it to bear, with happy results, upon our dealir.gs with the inhabitants of the interior.

Political Department. Bombay Castle, VZth December 1904. Prom C. H. A. HILL, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay ; To S. M. FRASER, Esq., C.I.E., Officiating Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. Sir, I am directed to reply to your letter No. 2483-E.A., dated the 5th August 1904, with which was forwarded a copy of the Secret Despatch from the Secretary of State No. 30, dated the 15th July last, dealing with the question of our relations with the tribes in the Hinterland of Aden, and I am to enclose a copy of the report No. 197, dated the 19th November 1904, from the Political Resident, Aden, reporting his opinion on the subject. 2. In his Despatch of the 1st April 1904 the Secretary of State defined the extent to which he was prepared to recognise that our obligations have increased as being (1) the performance of friendly offices for the Turkish officers; and (2), in particular, the restraint of the tribes within the British Pro tectorate from committing offences beyond the border. In the Despatch of July last the Secretary of State reiterates his recognition of the fact that to this extent the responsibility of the Government of India in regard to the external relations of the protected tribes has increased, and he proceeds to make certain suggestions for regulating our policy towards the tribes in internal affairs. Two definite proposals are put forward for discussion, first, that by the superior influence of the Sultan of Lahej, or secondly, that by a clear understanding with each separate tribe, Government might induce the tribes to come to an arrangement amongst themselves in the matter of (a) common duties, such as the protection of their trade routes, and (b) those connected with religious and inter-tribal disputes. 3. The Governor in Council has given this important question his most attentive consideration. It does not seem to him to be necessary to trace at length the history of the development of our policy towards the Arab tribes in the neighbourhood of Aden, since the final stage of this has still been, as quoted by the Secretary of State, the “ principle of tribal responsibility coupled with the minimum of British interference;” and the problem at present confronting us is not so much, whether that policy is to be abandoned, as in what manner it can be adapted, if adaptation is needed, to the circumstances brought about by the operations of the Boundary Commission. 4. I am now to turn to the specific suggestion of the Secretary of State. It will be seen that the Political Resident at Aden is averse to the proposal to impose upon any one Chief, such as the Sultan of Lahej, the responsibility of maintaining authority over any considerable number of the tribes. As the Government of India are doubtless aware, the authority of the Sultan of Lahej does not extend even to the Subaihi, who are theoretically his vassals; still less does he enjoy any real power over the Haushabi, although he was, for some time at least, their conqueror. Moreover, any attempt unduly to exaggerate tiie importance or influence of any one tribe has the inevitable result of alienating the others who are by no means prepared to view with a friendly eye an increase con 18442 in the status and privileges of any ^or^advi^aXhelp. . of Lahej and to the convenience of a policy ° £ “ vi cw, hut the the drawbacks here referred to av measure calculated to create a pre- pondeTting 11 inCn^^Tvour of any L tribe would have lamentable con- seq uences to our relations with the others. 5. Under these circumstances, the^Governmoid. unable to regard the first proposal ,, support the alternative afford a solution of the problem Nor, a^ ^ it P ^ ould be hopeless to suggestion.

Accompaniment to lettev No. 7818, dated the \Qth Decembev 1901, to the Government of India, Foreign Department. Letter No. 197, dated the 19 th November 1904. From—Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden; To—C. H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government ofjBombay, Political Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 4989, dated the 11th August 1904, calling for the report required by the Government of India Office Despatch No. 30 (Secret), dated the 15tli July 1904, wherein His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India has indicated the need for a clear under standing as to the intentions and limitations of the protectorate agreements entered into with the Arab tribes in the Aden Hinterland, and desires to be favoured with the views of the Indian Government as to the extent of their obligations to the tribes and their means of executing them. 2. In reply, I have the honour to state that the Secretary of State’s remarks do not apparently have reference to the increased responsibilities devolving upon the British Government in consequence of the demarcation of the frontier. These have been already discussed in the correspondence regarding the proposal for a frontier levy and the new treaty with the Amir of Dthala. I am now called upon to define precisely the obligations imposed upon us by the existing protectorate treaties. What these liabilities are seems to me to be clearly understood as will appear from Bombay Government letter to the Government of India, No. 5151, dated the 14th July 1902, and my predecessor’s letters Nos. 144 and 167, dated respectively the 28th April and 7th June 1903. 3 . I may, however, again point out that though under the earlier agree ments we only made peace and friendship wiih the tribes, and they undertook to keep open the trade routes and protect travellers on them, the later protec torate treaties invariably provide for the following stipulations as succinctly summarized in paragraph 5 of General Maitland’s confidential letter No. 76, dated the 2nd April 1904 :— , (I) Peace and friendship and freedom of intercourse, that is to say, the subjects of each shall be free to come and go in the territories of the other, and shall mutually be accorded protection and respect. (II) Then come the protectorate clauses— (&amp;) The gracious favour and protection of His Majesty the King- Emperor is accorded to the territory of the Chief and its depen dencies. (6) The Chief binds himself and his successors and his tribe to refrain from entering into any correspondence or treaty with any other nation or power; and also promises to give immediate notice of any attempt at interference. (c) The Chief binds himself and his successors not to cede, or otherwise dispose of, any part of his territories to any power other than the British Government. (III) The Chief promises, on behalf of himself, his successors and his tribe, to keep open the roads in his territory and to protect persons usin^- them for the purposes of trade whether going towards Aden or comin' therefrom. ° 4. The first of these stipulations does not impose any obligation except that when the Arab Chiefs and their followers come to Aden they are to be afforded protection and treated with respect. The word “ respect ” is in the minds of the tribesmen ordinarily synonymous with entertainment in the guest- CON 18452 house and liberal presents. Though no opportunity is lost in impressing upon the Arab Chiefs and their followers that the hospitality accorded and the nresents given are conditional on their good behaviour, it has been diiGcult to disabuse their minds of the notion they have formed, and they claim both hospitalitv and gifts as a matter of right. The liabilities in this respect nuist, therefore,' continue to exist, and Government are themselves aware of the la ge amounts annually spent in entertainment and presents. 5 Bv the protectorate clause of the treaties we have taken upon ourselves I national responsibility, inasmuch as we have * cro ^ f the tribes against foreign aggression. This is more or less well understood y a l the tribesmen, particularly those on the frontier, to whom I believe, the matter has been fully explained by the Commission. As to the best means of fulfil- ling this responsibility, it must apparently be decided on each occasion as necessity arises. 6 The third stipulation is binding on the Chief, but corresponding there to there is a public duty devolving upon the British Government to se e that the safety of the caravan routes is maintained in the interests of tiade. As to best to fulfil this obligation is the question. It is suggested m the Secretary of State’s despatch that it might be possible either by the superior influence of the Sultan of Lahej, or by a clear understanding ^ induce the tribes to come to a common arrangement amongst themselve. reference to the protection of the trade routes which is a duty common to all of them Interruption on the roads, if not invariably is frequently the result of inter-tribal dilferences. So long, therefore, as Wood feuds and quarrels, which often break out in open strife, continue to exist between the tribes or their sub-sections, it will, it seems to me, be impossi e 0 , voluntarily come to any common understanding or even, if they do, to mak them adhere to it for any length of time. 7 In this connection another course suggests itself, namely, to make one or more of the important Chiefs responsible for the safety oi the routes^ Bu the policy of using one Chief to control tribes other than his own has not been r, success^ and I do not think ever could he successful for any length of tune as has been illustrated in the history of the Abdali. The Sultan of Lahcj cou not maintain his authority over the Subaihis, and more recent events showed that he had no influence over the Haushabi, whose Sultan m a '' eak ulaced himself under subjection to the Abdah. So long as the selected Sultan Fs of strong individuality and character the arrangement would work well. Butin the event of his successor proving to he weak it cannot W maintaine except with the moral and material support of the British. Affording such assistance to any Chief to keep his authority over tribes other than his own, that is throw in' the weight of our power in favour of one tribe against anot er, would; it seemoto me, bo°not quite'consistent with our traditional policy of non-interference in inter-tribal matters. 8 The only measures we can adopt at present to enforce the maintenance of the safety of the trade routes are either punitive expeditions or discontinu ance of the stipends and presents.

In continuation of my letter No. ‘/20-P., dated the 16th September 1903, I am directed to forward, for the orders of the Government of India, copy of a letter No. 255, dated the 30th September 1903, from the Political Resident, Aden, reporting the conclusion of a provisional treaty with the Hadthrami sec tions of the Yatfai tribe and requesting permission to conclude a treaty with the Shaikh of the Shaibi Clan. 2. I am to state that any remarks the Bombay Government may desire to make will follow, possibly by telegram. No. 255, dated Camp Dchala, the 30thiSeptember 1903. From —Major-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. In continuation of my No. 222, dated 3rd September 19)3, I have the honour to report that I have ventured, in anticipation of the sanction of Gov ernment, to conclude a treaty with one of the smaller sections of the Yaffai, viz., the Hadthrami. 2. The Chief of this Section, Sheikh Mohsin bin-Mohsin, is a person of some importance. The territory occupied by his tribesmen is of a considerable extent, lying immediately behind, and contiguous to, the District of Dthabiani, one of the border districts of Yaffa, our claim to which is disputed by the Turkish Commission. 3 . The Chief, who had been very helpful when the Survey party and Captain Warneford w r ent into Rubiaten, was anxious for a treaty, and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I thought it advisable to give him one, distinctly explaining to him at the same time that approval and ratification by Government were necessary before the treaty had any value. The terms of the treaty are identical with those of the Dthubi and Muflahai treaties and the stipend is only ten dollars per mensem. I trust that my action will be approv ed, and that the Government of India will be pleased to ratify the treaty. 4. In paragraph 7 of my letter No. 224, dated 2nd August 1903, it was stated that there was some doubt about the Daudi Section, who might bedependents and not a regular section of the Yaffai-as-Saffah Fi further knowledge of the tribe we have now gained, I think the Daudi may eliminated as a section, and the Hadthrami substituted Ihey are quite imle pendorit of any other section, while the Daudi appear to be ircc y s 1 Sultan Kahtan-bin-Omar, and would therefore be covered by the treaty tlie latter. 5 . I would further ask permission to conclude a treaty on the same terms, and granting the same stipend, with Sheikh Ah Mana-as-Sakladi, the heredi tary Sheikh of the whole Shaibi clan. I did not originally contemplate enter in 0, into any separate agreement with the Shaibi, but Captain jU* no , opinion tU Jthe Shaibi are actually on the frontier, and the Mausa ta have somewhat less power over them than we supposed, a t^^,.^h Al' i ana and his successors, and the grant of a small stipend would dist nctly tend to the peace and security of that part of the border. I concur in this view and I venture to hope that sanction to the engagement may be conveyed by tele gram, so that it can be carried out before 1 leave for Aden at the end of October. 6 . With regard to the announcement of the treaties, the permission given me to delay doing this in Government of India telegram No. 20C4.K, of 1st Septemberjhas been very useful, more particularly in the case of the Maiisatta. I propose, however, to announce the treaties before leaving Dtbala for Aden and will telegraph the date later. OrEnclosure No. 2. Telegram, dated the 3rd January 1904».

I am to append the treaty in triplicate, and to recommend it for ratifi cation by the Government of India. 3.

The treaty is identical with the treaty concluded with the Dthubi clan of the Yaffai, but the stipend is only ten dollars per mensem. 3. The treaty was signed and sealed by Sheikh Ali-bin-Moneh at Sulek on the 5th December in the presence of Captain Warneford, and the signature is duly attested. It was signed by me at Aden on the 14th December. This is stated in the treaty, and I trust the procedure will be approved, as it is that which is to be adopted, with the sanction of the Government of India, in the case of the treaty with Sultan Saleh-bin-Abdulla of the Upper Yaffai. 4. The treaty will take effect from the date of the first signature. Foreign Office Press—No. 431—13-2-04—54.TREATY WITH THE SHAIBI TRIBE OF YAFFAI-AS-SUFAL. The British Government and Ali-hin-Mane the Sakladi Sheikh of the Shaibi tribe, being desirous of entering into relations of peace and friendship; The British Government have named and appointed Major-General Pelham James Maitland, C.B., Political Resident at Aden, to conclude a treaty for this purpose. The said Major-General Pelham James Maitland, C.B., and the Sheikh Ali-bin-Mane the Sakladi aforesaid, have agreed upon and concluded the following Articles:— I • There shall be peace and friendship between the British and the Shaibi.

Ill The said Sheikh Ali-bin-Mane the Sakladi hereby agrees and promises on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and the whole of the Shaibi tribe to refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, or treaty with any foreign nation or Power ; and further promises to give immediate notice to the Resident at Aden, or other British officer, of the attempt by any other Power to interfere with the territory of the Shaibi and its dependencies. IY The said Sheikh Ali-bin-Mane the Sakladi hereby binds himself and his heirs and successors for ever that they will not cede, sell, mortgage, lease, hire, or give, or otherwise dispose of, the territory of the Shaibi, or any part of the same, at any time, to any Power other than the British Government. Y The said Sheikh Ali-bin-Mane the Sakladi further promises on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and his tribesmen, that they will keep open the roads in the country of the Shaibi, and that they will protect all persons who may be going in the direction of Aden for the purpose of trade, or returning therefrom.

With reference to Foreign Department telegram No. 2529 E.-A., dated the 23rd October 1903, I am directed to forward, for the consideration of the Oovernment of India, copy of a letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 323, dated the 18th December 1903, on the subject of a treaty negotiated with Sheikh Mohsin-bin-Farid, the Upper Aulaki Chief of Yeshbum. 2 . I am to append the treaty in triplicate, and to recommend it for ratification by the Government of India. No. 323, dated Aden, the 18th December 1903. From—M ajor-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident at Aden, To The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to state that on the 8th instant I concluded a treaty with Sheikh Mohsin-bin-Farid, the Upper Aulaki Chief of Yeshbum (ordinarily spoken of as the “ Upper Aulaki Sheikh ”). The terms of tbe treaty are practically identical with that concluded in October last with Sultan Kahtan of the Upper Yalfai (not yet ratified) and with other Upper Yalfai treaties. The Chief accepted the 2nd Article, grant- in 0, the gracious favour and protection of His Majesty, with the exception o the particular word “himaya” (protection), which is understood to imply subjection. It will be remembered that the Nakibs of the Mausatta Yatlai would not*agree to this Article at all, and that it was omitted in their treaty. On the present occasion the difficulty has been got over by the substitution of the word “mudafa” for “himaya’ , . Both words mean protection, but « muc iafa ” does not necessarily carry with it a sense of the inferiority or dependency of the person or people protected. The stipend granted to the Chief of Yeshbum is sixty dollars per mensem. As Government are aware, the Sheikh is a person of considerable consequence, havin 0, real power over bis half of the Upper Aulaki (the Ahl Maan), and we could hardly have refused, in the present circumstances, to give more, it he had held out for it. The treaty is submitted herewith for ratification, if approved. Foreign Office Press—No. 433—13-2-04—54.TREATY WITH SHEIKH MOHSIN-BIN-FARID-BIN-NASAR-AL-YESLAMI-AL AULAKI.

In forwarding these papers, I am to observe that the Governor in Council is of opinion that the geographical position of the Behan*al*Kasab tribe alone is sufficient to render it desirable to conclude a Protectorate Treaty with them, and I am further to recommend the proposal of the Resident for the grant of a stipend of $30 per mensem to the Chief.

C.I.E., I.C S., Acting Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to report that shortly after the despatch of my telegram of 20th December, the Chief of Behan-al-Knsab, Sharif Ahmad*am-Mohsin un expectedly arrived in Aden with Salim bin Alt bin Nimran, the Sheikh of the Muradi tribe; Ali bin Husen, nephew of the ruling Sheikh of the Musahain; and Muhammad bin Shamak bin Ghanam, the son of the Chief of the Bal Harith. These men were brought by the Sharif as the representatives of the three principal Arab tribes in his district. They collectively desired that they might he formally taken under British protection. 2. This is the second visit we have received from Sharif Ahmad. He came to Dthala in September last, and asked that the frontier of his district might be surveyed, with a view to demarcation. This is a most unusual request. Even those who are sincerely anxious to be protected from Turkish domination, regard survey operations with suspicion, and very frequently with dislike. 3. The geographical position of Behan-al-Kasab was explained in my letter No. 341 of 30th December. It is the lower part of the tract drained by the Wadi Behan, which runs into the desert. It is adjacent to the territory of the Aulaki Sultan of Nisab, and there is no doubt that he claims and exercises some sort of suzerainty over it. With reference to the telegram from the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, dated 10th January (replied to on 12th January) I would observe that Behan-al-Kasab appears to me to be so closely connected, both geographically and politically, with the Aulaki country, and also with Beda, that its exclusion from the British Protectorate would not only be disliked by both, and possibly resented by the Aulaki Sultan, but would give to the Turkish Officials a vantage ground for intrigue which they would be likely to use to the detriment of British interests. 4 . Various efforts have been made by the Turks to obtain a footing in Behan-al-Kasab, or at least to create a party there, but so far, I believe, without much result. Should we, however, deliberately hand over the district to Turkey,2 the people would have to do the best they could for themselves. We should have the Sharifs and Sayads denouncing us, and undermining our influence, instead of supporting it, and the advantages which we nope to irain by laying down a boundary line to the desert would, I believe, be largely discounted. 5 From a geographical point of view also, the outer limits of Behan-al Kasab are the natural border, in continuation of the districts dependent on Heda, and they appear to be within the line drawn north-east from Lakamat-as-Shuh, to which the Turkish Government have agreed as representing the general run of the frontier in that region. 6 Of course our knowledge of the geography of the country is vague, and we have no certain information of the actual location of the various tribes. But it is at least reasonably cetrain that Behan-al-Kasab, or by far the greater part of it, lies within the north-east line of the Turks; and secondly, that the exclusion of the district would have a very undesirable effect. 7. The Government of India, in their telegram to the Secretary of State for India of 29th April 1903, said: “ We have always contemplated that it would be necessary to include in our protectorate * Behan*ai-Kasab. Beda an(i £ ower l$ehan,* which is under- stood to be under Aulaki protection.' In his reply of 4th May the Secretary of State authorised the negotiation of treaties with the Upper Aulaki, including if necessary, Lower Behan and Beda. Personally I have from the first felt assured of the advisability of including Behan-al-Kasab in the British 1 rotee- torate • but I have had doubts as to whether a separate treaty should be made with the Chief: first because it seemed possible that the district would be covered by a treaty with the Aulaki Sultan ; and, secondly because, that Chiet mio-ht perhaps feel aggrieved at our concluding an independent treaty with Behan-al-Kasab, at least without his consent. The opportunity which presented itself was one that would probably not occur again in the same very favourable form The Beda treaty has hung fire, and that with the Sultan of N isab is not yet coneluded. The British Ambassador at Constantinople is anxious, 1 understand, that we should be in a position, as we cannot at present demarcate the boundary from the Sana to the desert, to notify to Turkey where we consider that boundary to lie. For this purpose treaties with the Chiefs included in the protectorate, and a better acquaintance with their territories are required. Both these objects appeared to me to be served by the conclusion of a treaty with Sharif Ahmad, and I therefore acted on the general sanction contained in the Secretary of State’s telegram of 4th May 1903. 8 Mr. Bury is of opinion, from what he knows of the Aulaki Saltan, and the politics of that region, that the treaty with Sharif Ahmad will not be seriously objected to at Nisab. 9 The treaty is now forwarded for ratification, if approved. It will be seen that it is purely a protectorate treaty following the one given to the Lower Yaffai Sultan in 1895. No mention of a stipend is made in it, but 1 promised Sharif Ahmad to recommend him for a stipend of thirty dollars per mensem ; and as he is likely to be a faithful and useful ally, I hope the Gov- ernment of India will be pleased to sanction this allowance. 10 I would venture to suggest that, if the treaty meets with the approval of Government, its ratification, and that of the treaty with Sheikh Mohsin bin Farid, the Upper Aulaki Chief of Yeshbum, should not be long delayed. I am of opinion that, in this case, it is desirable that the treaties should be announced, and the payment of the stipends commenced, as soon as possible. G. I. C. P. 0.—So. 3730 P.

Enclosures of a letter to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, Eo. dated the 14th January, 1904.No 2.24), dated Aden, the 2nd August 1903 (Confidential). From— Brigadier-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident at Aden, To—The Hon'ble Mr. S. W. Edgf:rley, C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to report the present state of affairs with regard to the Upper Yaffai. I think it will he advisable, in the first instance, to give a brief account of this tribe, whose strength and position gives them peculiar importance. 2 . Originally the Yaffai were one tribe and extended over a large part of the south-west corner of Arabia. They were the dominant race in this part of the Arabian Peninsula, and are still regarded as the most powerful tribe in Yemen ; but portions of the Yaffai have split off, and became attached to, or incorporated in, other tribes, while the tribe itself has become divided into the two portions which have hitherto been known to us as the Upper Yaffai and the Lower Yaffai, hut which are properly designated “ Yaffai-as-Saffal ” and “ Yaffai Beni Kasid’k 3. It is not necessary here to attempt a description of the country of the Yaffai (known as “ Yaffa ”), hut it may he stated that it is of very considerable extent and almost entirely mountainous. It appears to he on the whole well watered, fertile, and thickly populated. The inhabitants speak of it as the “blessed YaffaThe people, especially the Upper Yaffai, differ from the great majority of those in the Aden Protectorate in being real fighting men. Bands of Yaffai are frequently employed by the Chiefs of less warlike tribes in their contests with each other, and occasionally the Yaffai take service at Hyderabad. The Haiti Chief of Shehr and Mokalla is of Upper l r affai origin, and usually has a body of Y r affai tribesmen in his pay. Never theless, the Yaffai generally, especially the Yaffai-as-Saffal, keep a good deal to themselves. Until recently the Chiefs of the latter have never visited Aden, nor have we had any direct relations with them. T. In all questions connected with the tribes in Southern Arabia it is necessary to bear in mind the nature of the tribal organisation in this country, and the position of the Chiefs. I think it is now clearly understood that the power of the Sultans of the tribes of Southern Arabia is limited They are elected by the tribe, always, it is true, from the members of a certain family, hut on the understanding that the power bestowed by the tribesmen may he taken away by them, and given to another member of the family, at pleasure. In many cases a Sultan heads a confederacy rather than a tribe, several clans of different origin agreeing to support &amp; Sviltan. v&gt;}io \s, prinms inter pares, a leader rather than a ruler. No Sultan has despotic powder. Some are of course much stronger than others, but few can put a tribesman to death for any cause whatever. In some instances the Sultan has hardly any direct authority at all. He can act only “ ba-al-basr”, that is by diplomacy. On the other hand, even the most loosely knit confederacies appear to have greater powers of cohesion than would be imagined, and elect Sultans from the same family for genera tion after generation. No tribe or group of tribes can do without a Sultan. It seems to be felt that in war (that is to say, in a contest involving the whole tribe) a leader is required who shall be apart from the jealousies of the Sheikhs of the various sections. The Sultan is also useful as a Court of Appeal, to whom disputes between the Sheikhs and their tribesmen can be referred. Further, almost all tribes have dependents. These are either weak tribes, or fragments of tribes, who receive protection, in return for which they are bound to fight for their protectors; or they are the non-fighting inhabitants of districts which have become incorporated in the possessions of the tribe, and who pay tribute in some form or other. In the former case the people are classed as “ asakar” (soldiers), in the latter they are simply “ rayah” (subjects). Over such depend encies the Sultans usually exercise real authority. 5 . The family of Bin Afif, of Kara, Sultans of the Yaffai Beni Kasid were originally Chiefs of the whole Yaffai tribe. It is said that about 100 years a r '0 Sultan Saif of this line gave a part of his country to a favourite follower] named Ali Harhara, who thus became an important Sheikh. We donot know the details of the story, nor are they of importance for present purposes. The main fact is that the descendants of Sheikh Ali became Sultan of the Yaffai-as-Saffal, comprising about two-thirds of the whole tribe. The family is now very numerous, numbering, according to Captain Warneford, some 400 persons. They form, therefore, what would be called in a Pathan tribe a “ Khan Khel ” of considerable strength. Jealousies and rivalries are, of course, rife among so large a number of persons all belonging to a ruling family, and several of whom are pretenders to the position of Sultan. I append a genealogical table which shows the principal members of the family, and their relationship to one another. It will be seen that there are two branches, viz., the direct descendants of Sheikh Ali Harhara, known as Ahl Khel Sheikh Ali, and a collateral branch, the descendants of Kahtan, a brother of Sheikh Ali. Until recently the Sultans appear to have been selected from the Ahl Sheikh Ali, but the present Sultan, Kahtan-bin-Omar, belongs to the other branch. 6 . The strength of the Yaffai tribe appears to be greater than we supposed. Hunter placed that of the Upper Yaffai at 15,000 fighting men. Captain Warneford, who has had good opportunities for arriving at a conclu sion, says that the Yaffai themselves compute their fighting strength at between forty and fifty thousand. He himself thinks they ma^ have as many as 30,000 fighting men altogether, though this is a maximum estimate. The fighting strength of the Lower Yaffai is about 10,000 men. Even if the Yaffai-as-Satfal can only turn out 20,000 to 25,000 men all told, they are a formidable tribe, though they are not yet so well armed as some of the other tribes in Southern Arabia. 7. The Yaffai-as-Saffal are sub-divided into five sections as below :— Fighting strength about (1) Mausatta—Nakib Ali Askar ... ... ... 10,000 (2) Dthubi—Sheikh Muhammad Muthanna-bin-Atif Jaber ... 7,000 (3) Muflahi—Sheikh Abdul Rahman ... ... ... 3,000 (4) Bosi—Sheikh Salim-bin-Ali ... ... ... 500 (5) Daudi—Sheikh Saleh-bin-Abdul Rab, A1 Fardi ... ... 500 The above is Captain Warneford’s enumeration, but there is a little doubt about the Daudi, who may be dependents, and not a regular section of the tribe. In addition to the above, there are— Fighting strength about (6) The Shaibi—Sheikh Maneh-bin-AH, As Sakladi ... ... 2,500 The Shaibi, though of Yaffai origin, are dependents of the Mausatta. They have a number of sub-sections who are more or less at feud with each other, and they are altogether a very disunited clan. The dependencies of Yaffa-as-Saffal appear to be— (1) Kubaten,which adjoins the Shaibi country. (2) Rayu. (3) Juban. (4) Ard-al-had. This district occupies, it is understood, the eastern portion of Yaffa, and marches with the Homakani tribe of Beda. 8 . The leading Sheikh of the Mausatta, who bears the title of Nakib, claims to be the actual head of all the Yaffai-as-Saffal, on the ground that he is the principal Sheikh of the principal section. At the election of a Sultan the Nakib binds the turban on the head of the latter, and theoretically no election is complete until this ceremony has been performed. The Sultans have no direct authority over any of the sections of the Yaffai proper, who claim and exercise complete independence in the management of their own affairs, and in settling disputes with each other. 9. The election of Kahtan-bin-Omar to the position of Sultan was not accepted by the Mausatta, who have never acknowledged his authority; and as this section, together with the Shaibi, amounts to about half of the3 whole Yaffai-as-Saffal, Kahtan-bin-Omar has not exercised even the very modified amount of authority accorded to Sultans of the tribe. . Moreover, be at one time accepted a stipend from the Turks, and this no doubt excited distrust and indignation among the majority of the tribesmen of all sections, who are opposed to Turkisn domination. It would appear, however, that Sultan Kahtan did not actually receive the stipend for any length of time, and he has long since broken off connection with the Turks, thereby regaining much of his former influence. The Dthubi, the section next in importance to the Mausatta, are supporters of Sultan Kahtan, as are also the Muflahi. Kahtan exercises authority to a greater or less extent over the dependent districts, and he is at the present time personally respected by the whole Yaffai-as-Saflal, including those who are politically opposed to him. The Mausatta have frequently expressed their intention of setting up a Sultan of their own from the members of the Ahl Sheikh Ali, but so far they have not done so. 10. On the receipt of the Secretary of State’s telegram of 4th May 1903, it was intimated to the Upper Yaffai that we were prepared to enter into negotiations with them for the conclusion of regular agreements which would put them on the same footing as the other tribes in the Aden Protectorate. The Mausatta had all along expressed a desire for a treaty, and it was under stood that the other sections were all willing to enter into engagements. As we gradually improved our knowledge of the actual state of affairs in the tribe, it became increasingly apparent that a treaty with the tribe as a whole was impracticable; but there seemed no reason why treaties should not be concluded with the Mausatta, the Dthubi, and the Muflahi, and with Sultan Kahtan ; the latter as representing the dependents of the Yaffai-as-Saffal, over whom he may be said to actually rule. The Bosi and Daudi being small sections, and whose country does not touch the frontier, might, it was thought, be left out, especially as they had never made any advance to us; while the Shaibi, though of importance, both from their numbers and geographical position, would be answered for by the Mausatta. There is a precedent for separate treaties or agreements in the case of the Subaihi, and also of the Wahidis of Balahaf and Bir Ali. 11 . The first section to come forward was the Dthubi. Their Sheikhs, Muhammad Muthanna-bin-Atif Jaber, and his brother, Amr Muthanna, visited Aden in May, and signed a treaty on the 11th of that month. They were distinctly informed, before witnesses, that the treaty would not be ratified unless other Chiefs of the Yaffai came in and concluded similar agreements, but that, if ratified, the payment of the stipend would commence from the date of the signing of the treaty. 12. After some delay, partly caused by the great age of Nakib Ali Askar and the great heat then prevailing, the Sheikhs of the Mausatta came in and signed a treaty on the 5th July. 13. The treaty with the Dthubi was partly a treaty of peace and friend ship, and partly a protective treaty. It appeared necessary to include provision for the former ; first, because we have had no previous understanding of any kind with the Yaffai-as-Saffal; and, secondly, because the Dthubi would never have entered on a treaty which did not include provision for a stipend. To their minds this was the essential point of the whole proceeding. There is no precedent for any such provision being included in a protective treaty with any of the Aden tribes. Ostensibly stipends are granted by Government on account of the services rendered by the Sultan or tribe in keeping open the roads and protecting travellers. This the Dthubi have duly undertaken to do; and although there has so far been little trade with the country of the Upper Yaffai, it undoubtedly produces coffee and other articles of export, while the opening out of so well populated tract may be expected to increase the demand for piece-goods and other imports. The protective clauses follow exactly those of the treaty of 1895 with the Lower Yaffai, as directed in the telegram of 4th May, already quoted. 14. The treaty with the Mausatta is on the same lines, but it took much longer to arrange, and finally it was agreed to leave out the first of theprotective clauses. In translating the phrase “ gracious favour and protection 99 , the Sheikhs could not get over the word “humaiyah”, which is the nearest Arabic equivalent for “ protection ”, They considered that it would have the appearance of placing them in the same position, as regards the British Government, as their own dependent tribes hold towards the Yaffai in * general, and they frankly said that this would not he pleasing to their tribesmen. Nevertheless, they readily accepted the succeeding clause, which contains the undertaking to refrain from entering into any correspondence or agreement with a foreign Power; also the next clause, binding themselves and their successors not to cede, or otherwise dispose of, any part of their territory to any Power other than the British Government. 15. It was pointed out to them that, if they insisted on the omission of the first clause, they would place themselves at a disadvantage, in so much that they would be binding themselves to certain things without obtaining an equivalent. They replied that they were aware of the fact, but were content to give the required undertakings without a formal promise of protection, trusting that the British Government would come to their assistance it neces sary. They added that, as regards the Turks, they were confident of being able to keep them out of their country. \ 16. I may add that, if I had pressed the protective clause, nothing would have persuaded the Sheikhs that we had not ulterior designs on their country, and as the omission of the clause clearly diminishes the responsibilities of the British Government as regards the Mausatta, it seemed best to let it go without making any great demur. 17. It will be noticed that both in this treaty and in that with the Dthubi, the dependencies of the tribes are not named. This was purposely done in accordance with the instructions contained in the Secretary of State’s telegram of 4th May to avoid pledges likely to cause difficulty when demarcation takes place. The most important dependency of these two sections appears to be the Shaibi country, the inclusion of which in the British Protectorate has been settled. 18. With regard to the stipends, I think a grant of forty dollars a month to the Dthubi, and fifty dollars to the Mausatta, may be regarded as moderate. It was not until after much negotiation that the latter was accepted, old Nakib Ali Askar letting out, in the course of conversation, that they had expected to get 300 dollars a month. 19. Sultan Kahtan came in almost on the heels of the Mausatta, with a great following of over 200 men. This was a far larger number than he should have brought down, and an effort was made to reduce their numbers at Dthala, but practically without success. The first week of his stay in Aden was, there fore, taken up in getting rid of this crowd, all of whom expected entertainment, and some small present on leaving. W~e succeeded with some difficulty in reducing the party to 28 persons, and were proceeding to settle the matter of the treaty with every expectation of a favourable result, when letters were received from Yaffai, through the Sultan of Lahej, that there had been a sort of domestic revolution among the adherents of Sultan K. ah tan which had 1 resulted in his deposition, on the ground that he was selling the country to the / British, and in the election of his brother, Saleh, in his place; this seems to ' have been carried out by some of the Ahl Sheikh Ali, supported mainly by one or two sub-divisions of the Dthubi. The Sheikhs of the Dthubi and most of the section are, it is believed, quite staunch, and Sheikh Abdul llahman of the Muflahi has told Captain Warneford that, notwithstanding this event, he intends to visit Aden as soon as Sultan Kahtan returns. Captain Warneford’s opinion is that the affair is not one of much importance, and that Sultan ] Kahtan will regain his position as soon as he gets back. Sheikh Ali Mohsin Askar, the nephew, and probably successor, of Nakib Ali Askar of the Mausatta, returned to Aden on hearing the news, and informed us that, as he himself had been instrumental in bringing Sultan Kahtan to Aden, the latter would receive support from the Mausatta (hitherto his principal opponents), and that his restoration would be speedily effected.20 . Nevertheless, it was impossible to conclude a treaty with a Sultan who admitted that he had been deposed in his own town, though this act might be only the work of a small portion of the tribe headed by his personal enemies. I therefore informed Sultan Kahtan that I should he unable to discuss anv agreement with him at present, but that, when he recovered his position, 1 should be happy to enter into negotiations. He was naturally disappointed, and pointed out that he would lose prestige if he were now to go hack without a treaty, but, of course, tins did not alter the facts of the case. All that we could do was to be somewhat more liberal in the matter of presents than would otherwise have been the case, and to be especially careful not to diminish in any way the personal respect with which he was treated. Sultan Kahtan has now left in a fairly contented state of mind, and it is possible that we may soon hear of the retirement of Saleh, who, according to Captain Warneford, is a somewhat unwilling actor in the affair. Personally, however, I am inclined to think that this event will not take place very soon, and that there may be a struggle of some duration before matters are finally settled. 21 . The incident shows that there is still a good deal of distrust among the Yaffai (see my telegram of 18th April 1903), but, on the other hand, there appears to have been recently some approach to an understanding between the main factions of the tribe, the principal men on both sides having to a certain extent sunk their differences, and agreed on a policy of friendship with the British Government. The movement against Sultan Kahtan has doubtless been engineered by the pro-Turkish party, with or without assistance from Kataba. Stories have been spread by the Turks of disasters in Somaliland, and their own speedy return to Jihaf and Jalela. To these tales colour has been given by the despatch of the detachments of British and Native infantry to Berbera last month, and more recently by the orders for the move of the Sapper Company from Dthala. No doubt encouragement has thus been given to the minority who, from fanaticism or jealousy, are inclined to the Turks, and they have played on the feelings of some of the much larger number who are simjdy suspicious. 22 . The treaties with the Dthubi and the Mausatta are forwarded by this mail in a separate cover. I would ask that, if they are approved by Govern ment, they may now be ratified. I hoped to have been able to send the treaties with Sultan Kahtan and with the Muflahi section as well, so that all four agreements might have been ratified together. But, in the circumstances which now exist, I am of opinion that it would be preferable not to delay the conclusion of the treaties with the Dtlmbi and Mausatta. These sections together represent about two-thirds of the whole tribe; and if they will act in concert, must dominate the remainder. I think that by the ratifying the treaties and commencing payment of the stipends, they would receive the support which it is desirable they should have in order to induce them to actively intervene in favour of Kahtan, or at least for the suppression of the pro-Turkish party. But if the treaties are ratified, I should he glad to be permitted to select the moment when the announcement of the ratification should be made.

Foreign Office PreeB—No. 884—20*8*03—64.No. 250, dated Aden, the 9th August 1903 (Confidential). From— Brigadier-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident at Aden, To—The Hon’ble Mr. S. W. Edgerley, C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the Roiiour to state that X received from Colonel Wahab, on the 5th instant, a copy of his letter to the Secretary, Government of India, No. 308, dated 28th July 1903, which I had not before seen. The letter, which was probably written before the receipt of the telegrams of the Government of India of 25th July, is of a controversial character, but I think I may notice one point, viz., the remark in paragraph 4 regarding the expediency of men tioning, in the treaty with the Mausatta, the outlying dependencies of Nawa and Juban. 2 . I have explained in paragraph 17 of my letter No. 224 of 2nd August, sent by last mail, that we purposely avoided mentioning the dependencies of the tribes in the treaties. The instructions of the Secretary of State were to avoid pledges likely to cause difficulty when demarcation takes place. Further, it has not been customary to name dependencies in treaties with the Aden tribes. I do not think there is any instance in which dependencies have been named in such treaties. In the absence of very much fuller information than we possess, it would, I think, have been highly dangerous to insert in a treaty the names of dependencies which are on the border land between the Yaffai-as- Saffal and Turkish territory. As far as our information goes, the Turks are likely to put in a claim to Juban, and nothing definite is known here about Nawa. 3. I would add that, as I understand the position, it appears to be peculiarly the province of the Boundary Commission to determine the status of the outlying districts on the borders of the tribes within the sphere of British influence, and that any attempt on the part of this Besidency to enter into such questions would lead to complications, and possibly create those difficulties which I was specially instructed to avoid. 4i. With regard to the grievances of Ali Mohsin Askar and his quarrel with his uncle, Ali Askar, the Nakib of the Mausatta, which form the subject of Colonel Wahab’s No. 312, dated 3rd August 1903, a brief explanation is perhaps desirable. Ali Mohsin Askar, though usually regarded as the probable successor to the Chiefship of the Mausatta, and the person who carries on, in the name of his uncle, most of the business of the tribe, has no claim to have his name inserted in a treaty; and if he had proposed this, his uncle would probably have disallowed it at once. Ali Mohsin Askar, besides what he has done for the Commission, has certainly been of assistance in arranging the Mausatta treaty, and in appeasing the feud between his uncle and Sultan Kahtan. He placed, however, rather a high value on his services, and wanted a regular stipend for himself. This was impracticable, stipends being only granted by treaty; but after much discussion I told him that I would allow him a fixed sum out of the allotment for Darbar presents which is at the disposal of the Resident. Government will no doubt remember that, when I first took up the appointment of Resident at Aden, the whole of the allotment (now standing at Rs. 31,000) was apportioned among the tribes. This was a tentative arrangement. After watching its working for some time I reported against it, and Government approved its abandonment. But there seemed to me no insuperable objection to granting a sort of personal allowance out of the “ Darbar Presents ”, as a special case. The allowance (twenty dollars a month) is strictly contingent on Ali Mohsin Askar’s good behaviour and further assistance when required. He appeared to be well satisfied and our parting was perfectly cordial. 5. The quarrel between Ali Mohsin Askar and his uncle was on this wise. Under arrangements made by the First Political Assistant, the Nakib was given a lump sum, calculated on a certain scale, for the parting presents2 to his less important followers. He gave this, or a considerable portion of it, to Ali Mohsin Askar for distribution. The latter appears to have unduly favoured his own friends, or followers, and the Nakib was greatly incensed. Ali Askar is very irascible, and in spite of his great age very masterful. We understand that his quarrels with his relations are frequent. Whether in consequence of Ali Mohsin Askar’s behaviour over the distribution of the presents, Ali Askar has also refused to give the latter any share of the stipend, we do not know, but the whole dispute is a family affair, which except at the present moment would probably be of little importance. Ali Mohsin Askar has apparently been trying to play off the Commission against the E-esidency. 6 . Colonel Wahab has written to the Nakib, asking his assistance in the matter of the Shaibi border, and I am writing to him to support Colonel Wahab’s request. I have also been informed by Captain Warneford that Ali Mohsin Askar, after an interview with himself, thought better of refusing to help the Commission in the matter of the Shaibi border, and wrote to them proffering assistance. He now appears to have returned to his home in Yaffa, Foreign Office Press—No. 1001—4-9.03—54. tTelegram, dated the 19th August 1903.

Sir, I am directed to forward, for the approval and ratification of the Government of India, the treaties (in duplicate) negotiated by the Political Resident, Aden, with the Sheikhs of the Dthubi and Mausatta clans o£ the Upper Yaifai tribe, in which they pledge themselves, inter alia, not to dispose of their territory to any other Power than the British Government. 2 .

The Governor in Council is of opinion that the amounts agreed upon are extremely moderate, having regard to the character and strength of the tribe, and may be sanctioned. 3 .

No. 224, dated the 2nd August 1903. From—Brigadier-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident, Aden ; To—The Honourable Mr. S.W. Edgkrley, C.I.E., I. C. S., Secretary to the Gov ernment of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to report the present state of affairs with regard to the Upper Yafifai. I think it will be advisable, in the first instance, to give a brief account of this tribe, whose strength and position gives them peculiar importance. 2 . Originally the Yaffai were one tribe and extended over a large part of the south-west corner of Arabia. They were the dominant race in this part of the Arabian Peninsula, and are still regarded as the most powerful tribe in Yemen, but portions of the Yaffai have split off and became attached to, or incorporated in, other tribes, while the tribe itself has become divided into the two portions which have hitherto been known to us as the Upper Yaffai and the Lower Yaffai, hut which are properly designated “ STaffai as Saffal ” and “ Yaffai Beni Kashi.’' 3. It is not necessary here to attempt a description of the country of the Yaffai (known as “ Tafia but it may be stated that it is of very considerable extent and almost entirely mountainous. It appears to be on the whole well watered, fertile and thickly populated. The inhabitants speak of it as the “ blessed Yaffa.” The people, especially the Upper Yaffai, differ from the great majority of those in the Aden protectorate in being real fighting men. Bands of Yaffai are frequently employed by the chiefs of less warlike tribes in their contests with each other, and occasionally the Yaffai take service at Hyderabad. The Kaiti Chief of Shahar and Mokalla is of Upper Yaffai origin, and usually has a body of Yaffai tribesmen in his pay. Nevertheless, the Yaffai generally, especially the Yaffai as Saffal, keep a good deal to them selves. Until recently the chiefs of the latter have never visited Aden, nor have we had any direct relations with them. 4. In all questions connected with the tribes in Southern Arabia it is necessary to bear in mind the nature of the tribal organization in this country and the position of the chiefs. I think it is now clearly understood that the power of the Sultans of the tribes of Southern Arabia is limited. They are elected by the tribe, always, it is true, from the members of a certain family, hut on the understanding that the power bestowed by the tribesmen may be taken away by them and given to another member of the family at pleasure. In many cases a Sultan heads a confederacy rather than a tribe, several clans of different origin agreeing to support a Sultan who is primus inter pares —a leader, rather than a ruler. No Sultan has despotic power. Some are, of course, much stronger than others, hut few can put a tribesman to death for any cause what ever. In some instances the Sultan has hardly any direct authority at all. He can act only “ ba-al-basr,” that is, by diplomacy. On the other hand, even the most loosely knit confederacies appear to have greater powers of cohesion than would be imagined, and elect Sultans from the same family for generation after generation. No tribe or group of tribes can do without a Sultan. It seems to be felt that in war (that is to say, in a contest involving the whole tribe) a leader is required who shall be apart from the jealousies of the Sheikhs of the various sections. The Sultan is also useful as a court of appeal, to whom disputes between the Sheikhs and their immediate tribes men can be referred. Further, almost all tribes have dependants. These are either weak tribes or fragments cf tribes who receive protection, in con 467—1iMQ 2 return for wliich they are hound to fight for their protectors, or they are the non-fighting ‘inhabitants of districts which have become incor porated in the possessions of the tribe and who pay tribute in some form or other. In the former case the people are classed as “ asakar ” (soldiers), in the latter they are simply “ rayah” (subjects). Over such dependencies the Sultans usually exercise real authority. 5 . The family of Bin Afif of Kara, Sultans of the Yaffai Beni Kasid, were originally chiefs of the whole Yaffai tribe. It is said that about 100 years ao’O Sultan Saif of this line gave a part of his country to a favourite follower named Ali Harhara, who thus became an important Sheikh. We do not know the details of the story, nor are they of importance for present purposes. The main fact is that the descendants of Sheikh Ali became Sultans of the Yaffai as Saffal, comprising about two-thirds of the whole tribe. The family is now very numerous, numbering, according to Captain Warneford, some 400 persons. They form, therefore, what would be called in a Pathan tribe a “ Khan Khel ” of considerable strength. Jealousies and rivalries are of course rife among so large a number of persons all belonging to a ruling family, and several of whom are pretenders to the position of Sultan. 1 append a genealogical table which shows the principal members of the family and their relationship to one another. It will he seen that there are two branches, pz. f —the direet descend ants of Sheikh Ali Harhara, known as Ahl Khel Sheikh Ali, and a collateral branch, the descendants of Kahtan, a brother of Sheikh Ali. Until recently the Sultans appear to have been selected from the Ahl Sheikh Ali, but the present Sultan, Kahtan bin Omar, belongs to the other branch. 6 . The strength of the Y^affai tribe appears to be greater than we supposed. Hunter placed that of the Upper Yaffai at 15,000 fighting men. Captain Warneford, who has had good opportunities for arriving at a conclu sion, says that the Yaffai themselves compute their fighting strength at between forty and fifty thousand. lie himself thinks they may have as many as 30,000 fighting men altogether, though this is a maximum estimate. The fighting strength of the Lower Yaffai is about 10,000 men. Even if the Yaffai as Saftal can only turn out 20,000 to 25,000 men all told, they are a formidable tribe, though they are not yet so well armed as some of the other tribes in Southern Arabia. 7 . The Yaffai as Saffal are sub-divided into five sections as below:— Fighting strength. (1) Mausatta—Nakib Ali Askar, about ... .„ ... 10,000 (2) Dtbubi—Sheikh Muhammad Muthanna bin Atif Jaber, about. 7,000 (3) Muflahi—Sheikh Abdul Rahman, about ... ... 3,000 (4) Bosi—Sheikh Salim bin Ali, about ... ... ... 500 (5) Daudi—Sheikh Saleh bin Abdul Rab A1 Fardi, about ... 600 The above is Captain Warneford’s enumeration, but there is a little doubt about the Daudi, who may be dependants and not a regular section of the tribe. In addition to the above there are (d) The Shaibi Sheikh Maneh bin Ali as Sakladi, about ... 2,500 The Shaibi, though of Yaffai origin, are dependants of the Mausatta. They have a number of sub-sections who are more or less at feud with each other, and they are altogether a very disunited clan. The dependencies of Yaffai as Saffal appear to be— (1) Rubaten, which adjoins the Shaibi country. (2) Baym (3) Juban. (4) Ard-al-had. This district occupies, it is understood, the eastern portion of l r affa, and marches with the Homakani tribe of Beda.3 8 . The leading Sheikh of the Mausatta, who hears the title of Nakib, claims to he the actual head of all the Yaffai as Salfal, on the ground that he is the principal Sheikh of the principal section. At the election ol a Sultan the Nakib binds the turban on the head of the latter, and theoretically no election is complete until this ceremony has been performed. 1 he Sultans have no direct authority over any of the sections of the Yaffai proper, who claim and exercise complete independence in the management of their own affairs and in settling disputes with each other. 9 . The election of Kahtan bin Omar to the position of Sultan was not accepted by the Mausatta, who have never acknowledged his authority, and as this section, together with the Shaibi, amounts to about half of the whole Yattai as Saffal, Kahtan bin Omar has not exercised even the very modified amount of authority accorded to Sultans of the tribe. Moreover, he at one time accepted a stipend from the Turks, and this no doubt excited distrust and indignation among the majority of the tribesmen of all sections who are opposed to Turkish domination. It would appear, however, that Sultan Kahtan did not actually receive the stipend for any length of time, and he has long since broken off connection with the Turks, thereby regaining much ot his former influence. The Dthubi, the section next in importance to the Mausatta, are supporters of Sultan Kahtan, as are also the Muflahi. Kahtan exercises authority to a greater or less extent over the dependent districts, and he is at the present time personally respected by the whole Yaffai as Saffal, me udmg those who are politically opposed to him. The Mausatta have frequently expressed their intention of setting up a Sultan of their own from the members of the Ahl Sheikh All, but so tar they have not done so. 10 On the receipt ot the Secretary of State’s telegram of 4th May 19 )3, it was'intimated to the Upper Yaifai that we were prepared to enter into negotiations with them for the conclusion of regular agreements which would nut them on the same footing as the other tribes in the Aden protectorate. The Mausatta had all along expressed a desire for a treaty, and it was understood that the other sections were all willing to cuter into engage ments. As we gradually improved our knowledge ot the actual state of affairs in the tribe, it became increasingly apparent that a treaty with the tribe as a whole was impracticable, hut there seemed no reason why treaties should not be concluded with the Mausatta, the Dthubi and the Muflahi and with Sultan Kahtan, the latter as representing the dependents of the Yattai as Satta over whom he may be said to actually rule. The Bos, and Baud, being sma 1 sections and whose country does not touch the frontier, might, it was thought, bs left out, especially as they had never made any advance to us while the Shaibi, though of importance, both from their numbers and geographioa posi tion, would be answered for by the Mausatta. There is a precedent for separate treaties or agreements in the case of the Subaihi, and also of the Wahidis of Balahaf and Bir All. 11 The first section to come forward was the Dthubi. Their Sheikhs, Muhammad Muthanna bin Atif Jahar, and his brother Amr Muthanna visited Aden in May and signed a treaty on the Uth of that month. They were distinctly informed, before witnesses, that the treaty would not be ratified unless other chiefs of the Yaffai came in and concluded similar agreements but that if ratified the payment of the stipend would commence from the date ot the signing of the treaty. 12 After some delay, partly caused by the great age of Nakib All Askar, and the gr7at heaUhen prevailing, the Sheikhs of the Mausatta came in and signed a treaty on the 5th July. 13 The treaty with the Dthuhi was partly a treaty of peace and friend- ship and partly a protective treaty. It appeared necessary to include pro- vidon for the former-first, because we have had no previous understanding Tan ' kind with the Yaffai as Saffal; and secondly,_ beeause the Dthubi wmuY never have entered on a treaty which did not include provision for con 467—24 a stipend. To their minds this was the essential point of the whole pro ceeding. There is no precedent for any such provision being included in a protective treaty with any of the Aden tribes. Ostensibly stipends are granted by Government on account of the services rendered by the Sultan, or tribe, in keeping open the roads and protecting travellers. This the Dthubi have duly- undertaken to do, and although there has so far been little trade with the country of the Upper Yaffai, it undoubtedly produces coffee and other articles of export, while the opening out of so well populated tract may be expected to increase the demand for piece-goods and other imports. The protective clauses follow exacUy those of the treaty of 1895 with the Lower Yaffai as directed in the telegram of 4th May, already quoted. 14. The treaty with the Mausatta is on the same lines, hut it took much longer to arrange, and finally it was agreed to leave out the first of the pro tective clauses. In translating the phrase “ gracious favour and protection ” the Sheikhs could not get over the word “ humaiyah,” which is the nearest Arabic equivalent for “ protection They considered that it would have the appearance of placing them in the same position, as regards the British Government, as their own dependent tribes hold towards the Yaffai in general, and they frankly said that this would not be pleasing to their tribesmen. Nevertheless, they readily accepted the succeeding clause, which contains the undertaking to refrain from entering into any correspondence or agreement with a foreign power; also the next clause, binding themselves and their successors not to cede or otherwise dispose of, any part of their territory to any power other than the British Government. 15. It was pointed out to them that, if they insisted on the omission of the first clause, they would place themselves at a disadvantage, in so much that they would be binding themselves to certain things without obtaining an equi valent. They replied that they were aware of the fact, but were content to give the required undertakings without a formal promise of protection, trusting that the British Government would come to their assistance if neces sary. They added that, as regards the Turks, they were confident of being able to keep them out of their country. 1(5. I may add that, if I had pressed the protective clause, nothing would have persuaded the Sheikhs that we had not ulterior designs on their country, and as the omission of the clause clearly diminishes the responsibilities of the British Government as regards the Mausatta, it seemed best to let it without making any greater demur. 17. It will be noticed that both in this treaty and in that with the Dthubi the dependencies of the tribes are not named. This was purposely done in accordance with the instructions contained in the Secretary of State’s teleo-ram of 4th May to avoid pledges likely to cause difficulty when demarcation takes place. The most important dependency of these two sections appears to be the Shaibi country, the inclusion of which in the British protectorate has been settled. 18. With regard to the stipends, I think a grant of forty dollars a month to the Dthubi and fifty dollars to the Mausatta may be regarded as moderate. It was not until after much negotiation that the latter was accepted, old Nakib Ali Askar letting out, in the course of conversation, that they had expected to get 300 dollars a month. 19. Sultan Kahtan came in almost on the heels of the Mausatta with a great following of over 200 men. This was a far larger number than he should have brought down, and an effort was made to reduce their numbers at Dthala, but practically without success. The first week of his stay in Aden was therefore taken up in getting rid of this crowd, all of whom expected entertainment, and some small present on leaving. We succeeded with some difficulty in reducing the party to 28 persons, and were proceeding to settle the matter of the treaty, with every expectation of a favourable result, when letters were received from Yaffa, through the Sultan of Lahej, that there had been a sort of domestic revolution among the adherents5 tmSSim of Sultan Kahtan which had resulted in his deposition, on the ground that he was selling the country to the British, and in the election of his brother Saleh in his place. This seems to have been carried out by some of the Ahl Sheikh Ali, supported mainly by one or two sub-divisions of the Dthubi. The Sheikhs of the Dthubi and most of the section are, it is believed, quite staunch, and Sheikh Abdul Rehman of the Muflahi has told Captain Warneford that, not withstanding this event, he intends to visit Aden as soon as Sultan Kahtan returns. Captain Warneford’s opinion is that the affair is not one of much importance, and that Sultan Kahtan will regain his position as soon as he gets back. Sheikh Ali Mohsin Askar, the nephew, and probably successor, of Kakib Ali Askar, of the Mausatta, returned to Aden on hearing the news, and informed us that as he himself had been instrumental in bringing Sultan Kahtan to Aden, the latter would receive support from the Mausatta (hitherto his principal opponents) and that his restoration would be speedily effected. 20 . Nevertheless it was impossible to conclude a treaty with a Sultan who admitted that he had been deposed in his own town, though this act might be only the work of a small portion of the tribe headed by his personal enemies. I therefore informed Sultan Kahtan that I should be unable to discuss any agree ment with him at present, but that when he recovered his position I should be happy to enter into negotiations. He was naturally disappointed, and pointed out that he would lose prestige if he were now to go back without a treaty, but of course this did not alter the facts of the case. AH that we could do was to be somewhat more liberal in the matter of presents than would otherwise have been the case, and to be especially careful not to diminish in any way the personal respect with which he was treated. Sultan Kahtan has now left in a fairly contented state of mind, and it is possible that we may soon hear of the retire ment of Saleh, who, according to Captain Warneford, is a somewhat unwilling actor in the affair. Personally, however, I am ipclined to think that this event will not take place very soon, and that that may be a struggle of some duration before matters are finally settled. 21. The incident shows that there is still a good deal of distrust among the Yaffai {see my telegram of 18th April 1903), but on the other hand there appears to have been recently some approach to an understanding between the main factions of the tribe, the principal men on both sides having to a certain extent sunk their differences and agreed on a policy of friend ship with the British Government. The movement against Sultan Kahtan has doubtless been engineered by the pro-Turkish party, with or without assistance from Kataba. Stories have been spread by the Turks of disasters in Somali land, and their own speedy return to Jihaf and Jalela. To these tales colour has been given by the despatch of the detachments of British and Native Infantry to Berbera last month, and more recently by the orders for the move of the Sapper Company from Dthala. No doubt encouragement has thus been &lt;uven to the minority who, from fanaticism or jealousy, are inclined to the Turks, and they have played on the feelings of some of the much larger number who are simply suspicious. 22. The treaties with the Dthubi and the Mausatta are forwarded by this mail in a separate cover. I would ask that, if they are approved by Govern ment, they may now be ratified. I hoped to have been able to send the treaties with Sultan Kahtan and with the Muflahi section as well, so that all four agreements might have been ratified together. But in the circumstances which now exist, I am of opinion that it would he preferable not to delay the conclusion of the treaties with the Dthubi and Mausatta. These sections together represent about two-thirds of the whole tribe, and if they will act in concert, must dominate the remainder. I think that by ratifying the treaties and commenc ing payment of the stipends they would receive tne support which it is desirable they should have in order to induce them to actively intervene in favour of Kahtan, or at least for the suppression of the pro-Turkish party. But if the treaties are ratified, I should be glad to be permitted to select the moment when the announcement of the ratification should be made.=53 Treaty with the Dthubi section of the Yajfai-as-Sajfal.

The Sheikh of Yeshbum will probably come in, but the Sultan of Nisab, who is the more important, is very unwilling to leave his country. He has, however, sent an accredited Agent to settle terms of the treaty. Agent has accepted treaty identical with that given to Dthubi and Muflahai Yaffai with of hundred dollars per month {sic). It is proposed that Agent shall now take back treaty for Sultan’s seal. Act of sealing is to be witnessed by Bury or other person in our behalf, who will return with Agent for that purpose. When he comes back with treaty, duly sealed, I will sign. It is undoubtedly of great importance to conclude treaty without further delay, and I would, therefore, ask permission to carry it out as proposed, in the special circumstances.

Edgerley, C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Gi /em inent of Bombay, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, I am directed to forward, for the orders of the Government of India, copy of a letter No. 285, dated the 22nd October 1903, from the Political Resident, Aden, on the subject of a treaty negotiated with Sultan Kahtan-bin- Omar of the Yaffai-as-Safal. 2 . I am to append the treaty (in duplicate), and to recommend that the Government of India may be moved to ratify it at an early date. No. 285, dated Camp Dthala, the 22nd October 1903. Fiom Major-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident at Aden, To—'The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to report that a treaty was concluded with Sultan Kahtan-bin-Omar of the Yaffai-as-Safal on the 21st instant, and it is forwarded by this mail for ratification, if approved. The stipend granted to the Sultan is fifty dollars per mensem, the same amount as that allowed to the Nakibs of the Mausatta. This is not a large sum, considering the rank and pretensions of Sultan Kahtan as head of a powerful tribe. 2 . Sultan Kahtan has accepted the nrotective clause II, to which the Mausatta Nakibs objected, and the treaty is practically identical with those given to the Dthube and Muflahai clans. 3. The only differences are that, in clauses I and HE, the words “ under his authority” are applied to qualify the word “ tribesmen ”, because the whole of the tribesmen of the Yaffai-as-Safal are by no means under Sultan Kahtan’s Fide my letter No. 224, dated the 2nd August authority ; tllOUgh (in theory) all the 190 *' t clans follow him in war. Also in clause IY, the words “ being under his authority and jurisdiction ” have been inserted after “ territory of the Yaffai-as-Safal ”. These words exist in all treaties in clause II.

The Sultan of the Yaffai-as-Sufal and his successors shall visit Aden when they please. They shall be treated with respect and he given passes to carry arms. . II. —In compliance with the wish of the aforesaid Sultan Kahtan-bin- Omer Har-Uara, Sultan of the Yaffai-as-Sufal, the British Government hereby undertakes to extend to the territory of the Sultan of Yaffai-as-Sufal and its2 dependencies, being under the authority and jurisdiction of the said Sultan, the gracious favour and protection of His Majesty the King-Emperor. III.—The said Sultan Kahtan-bin-Omer Har-Hara hereby agrees and promises, on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and the tribesmen of the Yaffai-as-Sufal under his authority to refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, or treaty with any foreign nation or Power; and, further, promises to give immediate notice to the Resident at Aden or other British officer of the attempt by any other Power to interfere with the territory of the Yaffai-as-Sufal and its dependencies. IY.—The said Sultan Kahtan-bin-Omer Har-Hara hereby binds himself and his heirs and successors for ever that they will not cede, sell, mortgage, lease, hire or give, or otherwise dispose of the territory of the Yaffai-as-Sufal, being under his authority and jurisdiction or any part of the same, at any time, to any Power other than the British Government.

In consideration thereof the British Government agrees to pay to the said Sultan and to his successor, or successors, a monthly sum of fifty (50) dollars, the half of which is twenty-five dollars.
