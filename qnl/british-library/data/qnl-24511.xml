It is from the local point of view of those who are familiar with or have to live at Henjam im portant that the cultivated valley should be inclu ded in our limits, in order to provide a distraction and occupation for the Telegraph Staff.

B. Eustace, Com mander His Majesty’s Ship 'Fox* and Senior Naval Of ficer Persian Gulf Division, to Vice-Admiral Sir Ed mund S. Pod, K.C.V.O., Commander-in-Chief, East In dies Station. I have the honour to forward, in compliance with the request of His Britannic Majesty’s Resident, a plan of the Limits of the Telegraph Station, Henjam, as defined by his telegram of 30th March 1906. A lack of materials has prevented the plan beirg prepared upon as large a scale as contemplated, but I submit that this scale will suffice for reference. The Southern limit, viz. a line S. 77° E and N. 77° W. through Table Hill, will ensure the supply of sweet water to the cultivated lands in Wady Mushi, - the water supply from the North is salt and has to be deflected from the gardens by bunds. This line also avoids the area examined by Russians (?) when searching for mineral oil. The area within these limits is roughly 3.4 square miles (nautical). About two-thirds of this area consists of barren rocky hills in a state of disintegration, due to the presence5 that are being washed away by the rain; a process which is also assisted by bhe fre quent earthquakes nhab cause fissures and shake down portions of the hillsides* The remaining third is a plain of sand and clay of which only a small portion can be cultivated, owing to the salts brought down from the hills by rain and wind. j Most of the wells in this zone only produce hrackish water, so that during the summer and autumn, water must be obtained from wells in the South side of Henlam, where sweet water can always be found.

Captain Eustace of His Majesty's Ship 'Pox” replied:- An East and West line from sea io sea, through the North part of Table Hill, hounds the valley (of Wady Mushi), and all reclaimed land now cultivated by the Telegraph Department. This line is 2.25 miles in length and the greatest breadth viz., from Table Hill to Cable Beacon on N. point of Henjam Island is 1.35 miles. Estimated area is 3.4 square miles, the majority of which is bare rock and sand, unfit for cultivation. 22nd April 1906. His Britannic Majesty's Legation considered that above was excessive. 25th A pril 1906 . Captain Eustace suggested that the above area be reduced to 700 acres, and that tne limits might be a N. 66 E and N. 52 W Hines from Table Hill to East and West Shores. This omits much worthless land contained in limits first pro posed (East and 1 est line througn j.able Hill).Note. Owing to magnetic influence the E. and W. line was found to he N. 77 W. and S. 77° E true, whilst an error in calculation reduced the area con tained ty this Southern Limit from 3.4 square miles to 1,200 acres (roughly). The extreme East point of the last suggested limit is an old stone cairn now whitewashed, on.the shore, Just to southward of mouth of the largest stream that runs out of Wady Mushi. The extreme south point is the old stone cairn on the top of Table Hill about 100 yards S.W. \ 4f the extreme North Cliff. The extreme western point is where the left shoulder of Jebal meets H. W. L. on the Western Shore of Henjam. The extreme North point is the Cable Beacon on the North Sand spit of Henjam. This area contains about 700 acres, also the sources of the sweet water that drains towards the reclaimed land in Wady Mushi, also the catchments areas for all tanks or wells on the slopes of Jebal Mushi. The Arabs of Henjam include in 'Mushi' the entire valley of that name, and also all the slopes of Jebal Mushi ; or brieily, the area suggested on 31st March 1906. (N.B.)(N.B.).

We should be glad of your opinion on general question m of retaining our position there.)FY CONFIDENTIAL. Jo.1462. XVI. K • Sir 5 'HERMES' at KARACHI, 18th May 1906. Vfith reference to Government of India telegram, Foreign Department 1640 E.A., of 22nd April 1906, which reached me just as I was leaving Maskat for Bombay on the 23rd ultimo, I have the honour to offer the following remarks for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- General in Council, observing that it v/as unfortunate that the telegram did not reach me a day or two earlier, when I could have studied the question on the spot, as I only left Hen jam on the 21st ultimo; but as I had walked over the concession with Captain Eustace of the 'Fox' on one occasion, and with Mr Lobo the Telegraph Clerk, on a second, I have a fair knowledge of it, and I have also consulted Captain Eustace, who was at Hen jam off and on for fully a month and has a thorough knowledge of the Island. 2.- While I am always adverse to giving up any territoy or concession without a 'quid pro quo', my idea always having been to hold on to all we have and to get hold of as much more as we can, - still there are occasions when it may be politically expedknt to give up something, il friction is decreased arid our own interests do not suffer. 3 .- The only plan I have of the concession was ma.de by the Captain of the 'Fox' and his officers, and in defer ence to a request of Major Cox's, was sent by me to him on the 19th April, so that I have not had the advantage of having it before me; but I think it will be found that if we reserve the area contained by lines drawn from fable Hill N.66 0 E. and N 52° W. we shall have all the best of the he Secretary to ^ ^ T The Government of Inca a. Foreign Department. cone essi onconcession, and should thus be able to surrender a good strip of land to the Persians - probably 500 or 600 acres (but it is difficult to estimate the acreage), and give them suitable building land on the east side of the Island with an anchor age for their soa.ts, but if this is done, our concession should be absolutely our own, no one being a.llowed to reside there or to enter into it without the permission of the British Representative in writing, and our telegraph staff should be free from all inrerference from the Persian Customs and other Of fb cials. The water supply being one of the difficulties in Henjam cane shoulr be taken,to retain all tanks and wells in our portion of the concession for the sole use of our subjects living there; this should be clearly laid down. 4. - With these safeguards, and if the Political Resident concurs,. I see no objection to reducing the area of our con cession, now that we have admitted Persian sovereignty ovef the island* I may not be correct in my view as to what por tion of our concession could be given up, and would suggest that Major Cox should define the limits, as I understand he will visit Henjam shortly. 5. - From a Naval point of view, Table Hill must be retained as it commands the entrance to the Gulf and a wireless telegraph station could be erected there which would keep us in touch with Khor Kawi, which I consider to be much the best strategical position in the Gulf (vide my letter, No. 286/1462. II. H. of 26th A ril 1906, para 2.2. My predecessor undoubtedly held the same opinion. 6. - Henjam is a good anchorage and boats can always land there, on the lee side of the spit which runs out from Cable Spit on the north side of the Island; it is a capital placeplace fort he crews, as they can bathe and play foot ball, and get healthy exercise. It compares very favourably with Basidu, which although a good anchorage for small vessels, is difficult of approach . for a ship drawing 20 feet of water, and it coa-ands no view of the entrance to the Gulf.. Should, however. Hen jam he ma.de a quarantine station, and it therefore becomes necessary to abandon it, I think Basidu is the next best place, but in this case a survey is most advis able, as the shoals are said to be extending. 7.- I think I should touch on the question of Clarence Strait - a fine piece of water - as a possible base. While, no doubt, there is good anchorage between Quoin Hill and Kuwai and higher up off Laft Kedim, the tides run strong and ships are not in a good strategical position as compared to Hen'jam or Khor Kawi, but a large Fleet could shelter there, and sea would rarely, if ever, stop coaling operations. The soundings are far apart and scanty and a survey is desirable if there is any intention of using these waters. 8.- In conclusion, it will be seen that I am in favour of retaining our position in Hen jam, but that I consider that area, of our concession may be rdduced under the safeguard suggested. 9.- A copy of this letter has been sent to the Admiralty; but it has been written without reference to them, and their Lordships may not concur in the views I have expressed. Should this prove to be the case, I shall inform you in due course. I have, &amp;c., (sd) Edmund S. Poe.

The Arabs of Henjam include in 'Mashi' the entire valley of that name and also all the slopes of Jebel Mtishi or briefly the area suggested on 31st March 1906. IT.B. Should it become necessary to allow sites for the Persian Colony in Henjam under their own Kalantar or Mudir then it is suggested that the S.E.end of Wadi Mashi be assigned them with the well at Sideru for this sweet water supply. The numerous ruins of *iunds and villages in this por tion indicate that at no very distant date it contained a con- s id enable population. I am of opinion that by clearing out old, digging new well and repairing the old bunds very much of its former fertility could be restored.

With reference to the views expressed by him therein, I venture to hope that it may be mode clear to the Persian Government that interference of this nature by their local Customs officials can but result in the production of incidents as undesired presumably by the Persian Government as they are by ourselves. No. 67 P., dated the 24th February 1906. From—H. Whitby Smith, Esq., Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, Karachi, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram, 65 words, of the 26th January 1906, I have the honour to say that I met ML. Stas, Director of Customs at Henjam, on the 12th February 1906, and allotted a site for the Persian Customs House building. I also set aside a water tank for use by the Persian officials. The agreement, which I understand has been forwarded to you for confirmation, explains fully what was done. The site allotted to the Persians for a Customs House is nearer to our building than was at first thought to be desirable, but I do not think there is any reasonable objection to it from our point of view, provided always that the Persian officials behave themselves properly. 2. As you are aware, our staff at Henjam have in the past often suffered from petty annoyances from the Persian Customs officials there. I expressed a hope to M. Stas that these would now cease, and that the Customs officials would confine themselves to their own work and not interfere in matters with which they have no concern. A typical case of such interference occurred while I was at Henjam. Last year we erected a small beacon on the sea shore within our limits, for the guidance of ships, to enable them to anchor clear of our cables. This beacon was knocked down in a storm and during our recent visit to Henjam we wished to erect another, somewhat stronger, on the same spot. Accordingly when we reached Henjam some of ship’s officers and men landed to begin the work, but as soon as they began to dig, a Persian Customs man appeared and wanted to stop the work. Our men continued to dig and then this man got into the hole that was being made with a loaded rifle in his hands and defied them to go on with the woik. It was only on receipt of orders from M. Stas that he got out of the hole and ceased to obstruct us. The beacon was then erected. 3. It is quite bad enough to have low class Persians, such as the inferior Customs officials usually are, wandering about within our limits, generally with rifles in their hands, but when to this is added interference by them in all sorts of matters with which they have no concern, the position becomes intolerable, and if continued it will be necessary to resume the site itfe have now by courtesy allotted to them and to obtain their remova a oget lei rom within our limits.4 13tli February 1906.

His Majesty’s Government will be willing, as soon as a satisfactory settlement has been arrived at, to notify to Arabs, if the Persian Government desire it, His Majesty’s Government’s recognition of Persian sovereignty, and to endeavour to obtain their acquiescence. We do not favour the suggestion contained in your telegram No. 41 of the 8 th Pebruary that Arabs should be offered British domicile at Bassidu. It is admitted that Arabs are Persian subjects, and although the station is British property, it stands on a Persian island. Accommodation and adequate protec tion could not conveniently be afforded to the Arabs, while awkward questions might be asked as to their status and as to limits of station, which are unde- p rom —E.

Please see Mr. Grant Huff’s telegram of 1st April and sub sequent messages from Major Cox, dated 3rd, 4th, and 5th April, which he has presumably repeated to Foreign Office. We support the view that the Persian Government should be dissuaded from any attempt to alter existing status on Henjam or to extend authority o/er, or to levy customs or taxes from, Arabs occupying the island beyond the limits of our Telegraph Station. They have not done this hitherto, and it ought to be sufficient that we have agreed to permit the Persian flag to be hoisted and Customs post to be built within the limits of our station area. The present excitement will probably subside, if the Arabs are assured by us that the Persian Government will not interfere with their existing autonomy. At any rate we would not employ British ships to coerce Arabs unless they threatened British subjects or pro perty and would not allow a Persian ship to operate against them in the existing circumstances. Action taken by Major Cox seems judicious and has our approval. Hr. Thomson reports that our station at Henjam includes possible site of a quarantine station on the island which is perhaps the least unsuitable place for such a station at the mouth of the gulf. He denies the necessity of any such station, but warns us that the conference might insist on this in which case it would he most desirable to keep the whole of the present area in British hands and so ensure actual control over the station by a British officer. The necessity for the maintenance of the position at Henjam is further indicated by this fact. Addressed to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India; repeated to Mr. Grant Huff and Major Cox.

POb, K.CV.O., Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station. I have the honour to forward, in compliance with the request of His Britannic Majesty’s Resident, a plan of the limits of the Telegraph Station, Henjam, as defined by his telegram of 30th March 1906. A lack of materials has prevented the plan being prepared upon as large a scale as contemplated, but I submit that this scale will suffice for reference. The southern limit, viz., a line S. 77 0 E. and N. 77 0 W. through Table Hill, will ensure the supply of sweetwater to the cultivated lands in Wady Mushi,—the water-supply from the north is salt and has to be deflected from the gardens by bunds. This line also avoids the area examined by Russians (?) when searching for mineral oil. The area within these limits is roughly 3 4 square miles (nautical). About two-thirds of this area consists of barren rocky hills in a state of disintegration, due to the presence of salts that are being washed away by the rain ; a process which is also assisted by the frequent earthquakes that cause fissures and shake down portions of the hill-sides.cv 9 The remaining third is a plain of sand and clay of which only a small por tion can be cuhifated, owing to the salts brought down from the fulls by ram and wind. Most of the wells in this zone only produce brackish water so that during the summer and autumn, water must be obtained from wells m the south side of Henjam, where sweet water can always be found.

While I am always adverse to giving up any territory or concession without a quid ^pro quo, my idea always having been to hold on to all we have and to get hold of as much more as we can, still there are occasions when it may be politically expedient to give up something if friction is decreased and our own interests do not suffer. 3. The only plan I have of the concession was made by the Captain of the &lt;c Eox” and his officers, and in deference to a request of Major Cox’s, was sent by me to him on the 19th April, so that I have not the advantage of having it before me ; but I think it will be found that, if we reserve the area contained by lines drawn from Table Hill N. 66° E. and N. 52° W., we shall have all the best of the concession, and should thus be able to surrender a good strip of land to the Persians—probably 500 or 600 acres (but it is difficult to estimate the acreage), and give them suitable building land on the east side of the island with an anchorage for their boats; but if this is done, our concession should be absolutely our own, no one being allowed to reside there or to enter into it without the permission of the British representative in writing, and our telegraph staff should be free from all interference from the Persian Customs and other officials. The water-supply being one of the difficulties in Henjam, care should be taken to retain all tanks and wells in our portion of the concession for the sole use of our subjects living there; this should be clearly laid down. 4. With these safeguards, and if the Political Resident concurs, I see no objection to reducing the area of our concession, now that we have admitted Persian sovereignty over the island. I may not be correct in my view as to what portion of our concession could be given up, and would suggest that Major Cox should define the limits, as I understand he will visit Henjam shortly. 5. Erom a naval point of view, Table Hill must be retained as it commands the entrance to the Gulf, and a wireless telegraph station could be erected there, which would keep us in touch vs’ith Khor Kawi, which I consider to be much the best strategical position in the Gulf (vide my letter No. 286-1462-11. H. of 26th April 1906, paragraph 2). My predecessor un doubtedly held the same opinion. 6. Henjam is a good anchorage, and boats can always land there, on the lee side of the spit, which runs out from Cable Spit on the north side of the island; it is a capital place for the crews, as they can bathe and play football and get healthy exercise. It compares very favourable with Basidu, which, although a good anchorage for small vessels, is difficult of approach for a ship drawing 20 feet of water, and it commands no view of the entrance to the Gulf. Should, however, Henjam be made a quarantine station, and it, therefore, becomes necessary to abandon it, I think Basidu is the next best place; but in this case a survey is most advisable, as the shoals are said to be extending.No. 1128 , dated Bushire, the 2 oth (received 28 th) May 1906 .

Proposed Limits of British Telegraph station at Henjam. 30th March /potf.—His Britannic Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, requested to know the limits of area claimed. o ls t March /potf.-Captain Eustace of H. M. S. ‘‘Fox ” replied :-An East and West line from sea to sea, through the North part of Table Hill bounds the valley (of Wady Mushi)^ and all reclaimed land now cultivated by the Telegraph Department. &lt; This line is 2*25 miles m length and the greatest breadth, viz'., from' Table Hill to Cable Beacon on N. point of Henjam Island is 1-35 miles. Estimated area is 3*4 square miles, the majority of which is bare rock and sand, unfit for cultivation.22nd April 1906.—Hk Britannic Majesty’s Legation considered that above was excessive. April Captain Eustace suggested that the above area be reduced to 700 acres, and that the limits might be a N. 66 E and N. 52 limes (sic) from Table Hill to East and West Shores. This omits much worth ess land contained in limits first proposed (East and West line through Table Hi ). Note. Owing to magnetic influence the East and West line was found to be N. 7 7° W. aud S. 77 0 E true, whilst an error in calculation reduced the area contained by this southern limit from 3*4 square miles to 1,200 acres (roughly). The extreme East point of the last suggested limit is an old stone cairn now whitewashed, on the shore, just to Southward of mouth of the largest stream that runs out of Wady Mushi. The extreme South point is the old stone cairn on the top of Table Hill about 100 yards S. W of the extreme North Cliff The extreme Western point is where the left shoulder of Jebal Mushi meets H. W. L. on the Western Shore of Henjam. The extreme North point is the Cable Beacon on the North Sand spit of Henjam. This area contains about 700 acres, also the sources of the sweet water that drains towards the reclaimed land in Wady Mushi, also the catchments areas for all tanks or wells on the slopes of Jebal Mushi. The Arabs of Henjam include in “ Mushi ” the entire valley of that name, and also all the slopes of Jebal Mushi; or briefly, the area suggested on 31 st March 1906. —Should it become necessary to allow sites for a Persian Colony in Henjam under their own Kalantar or Mudir, then it is suggested that the S. E. end of Wady Mushi be assigned to them with the well at Sideru for their sweet water-supply. The numerous ruins of bunds and villages in this portion indicate that at no distant date, it contained a considerable population. I am of opinion that by clearing out old and digging new wells and repairing the old bunds, very much of its former fertility could be restored. The fresh water for their subsistence could be obtained in this part of Henjam at a considerable less cost than by any scheme to obtain more water from our limits, where the existing supply is inadequate to the support of our present personnel. I would strongly deprecate any further increase to the population within our limits until the existing stock of water is trebled by the restoration of the old tanks as an insurance against the recurrence of droughts and water famines.

Sir In accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram No. 52 of the 5th instant on the sul&gt; jecu of Hen jam I at once addressed to the Persian Government the note copy of which I have the honour to enclose. Although I have not yet succeeded in obtaining a written answer to my notes of February 20th and April 7th the Mushir-ed-Dowleh informed me on the 19th instant that the demand of His Majesty's Government for the land at Henjam occupied from 1868 to 1880 by the Indo-European Telegraph Department placed the Persian Government in a very difficult position. The land in question covered an area of over three square miles and it was impossible for the Shah to alienate such a large extent of his ter ritory. Besides, if this land was granted to Great, Britain, Russia, who was ever on the look out for an opportunity of demanding territory on the northern frontier Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P.,. iiH or onrp make a similar re*' frontier of Persia would au once ma K e quest. The Persian Government were prepared to grant a reasonable area of land round the houses of the Telegraph officials and if further land were needed, it could he rented in the usual manner. I replied that I had no instructions uo accept- less than the area held by the Indo-European Telegraph Department from 1868 to 1880. I again pointed out to His Excellency that the ) land required had been held by us for 12 years with out the smallest protest on the part of the Persian Government. If the Russians made demands it would not be difficult to pub them off by saying that the land at Henjam had been in possession of Great Brit ain for nearly forty years. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh answered that if the land had been held for this period it had been acquired without the knowledge or consent of the Persian Government. No land was men tioned in the original concession. In my telegram No.113 of the 19th instant I ventured to suggest that the area demanded viz., 3.4 square miles is rather extensive. I do not thinkthink that m their present mood the Persian Govern ment are likely to acquiesce in our occupying so large a concession and unless, for reasons of which I am unaware, it is really necessary to hold out for tne whole, it might he more politic to ask for less and 80 corne to a compromise. I also tranemn a copy of a note to the Mushlr- ed-Dowleh giving the exact area of the land denanded according to the details furnished to me by His Maj esty's Consul at Bushire. I have &amp;c., (Signed) Evelyn Grant Duff,(&amp;) Mr. Grant DaXf to Mushir-ed-Dowleh. April 3rd, 1906. In accordance with your request I instructed His Majesty's Consul General at Bushire to obtain the measurements of the land occupied by the offi cials of the I.E.T. Department, at Henjam from 1863 to 1880. The total area of the land is about 3.4 square miles. The east and west line from sea to sea along the southern boundary line is 2i miles long.

Your Excellency denied all knowledge of such an intention on the part of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and promised to inquire from the Grand Vizier if his Highness had given such instructions. As I had the honour to inform your Excellency, it is, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, desirable that the limits of the British telegraph station at Henjam shall he satisfactorily settled, and I have already, in my note of the 12th instant, placed before your Excellency the views of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the matter. ’ Till this question is disposed of, His Majesty’s Government must object to any coercive action against the Arabs resident on Henjam, as likely to endanger the British telegraph officials in charge of the station, and in the event of the Darya Begi or any other Persian official attempting to take such measures, His Majesty’s Government will be compelled to send a ship of Avar to the island. There is, as I explained to your Excellency, much excitement among the Arabs, avIio apparently recognize the Sultan of Muscat as their Sovereign. In these circumstances I hope that the Persian Government Avill refrain from any measure which might lead to regrettable consequences. As soon as a satisfactory agreement has been reached regarding the limits of the telegraph station, I am to state that His Majesty’s Government Avill he prepared, should the Persian Government so desire, to notify to the Arab community their recognition of Persian sovereignty, and Avill endeavour to obtain their acquiescence.

Foreign Office, February 20, 1906. You should inform Persian Government that, until the limits of the British telegraph station have been satisfactorily settled, His Majesty’s Government will be obliged to object to any coercive action being taken by the Persian Government against the Arabs. Such action would be considered likely to endanger the safety of British telegraph officials, and if taken would lead to adoption of Major Cox’s suggestion to send a war-ship to the spot. As an additional reason for an early settlement of the question on the lines indicated in my telegram No. 8 of the 9th January, you should urge the present state of excitement which exists among the Arabs (see Lieutenant Shakespeare’s letter to the Resident of the 24th October, 1905). His Majesty’s Government will be willing, as soon as a satisfactory settlement has been arrived at, to notify to Arabs, if the Persian Government desire it, His Majesty’s Government’s recognition of Persian sovereignty, and to endeavour to obtain their acquiescence. We do not favour the suggestion contained in your telegram No. 41 of the 8th February, that Arabs should be offered British domicile at Basidu. It is admitted that Arabs are Persian subjects, and although the station is British property, it stands on a Persian island. Accommodation and adequate protection could not conveniently be afforded to the Arabs, while awkward questions might be asked as to their status and as to limits of station, which are undefined.w Draft.

On 10th January Consul-General at Bn shire reported to Government of India Arab community at Henjam who recognized Sultan of Muscat as Sovereign, prepared to offer forcible resistance to Persian authority, and asked permission owing to uncertain state of things in Persia to suspend action on orders received apparently instructing* him to intimate to Arabs that His Majesty’s Government recognized Persian sovereignty over island. If it was decided that he ought to give intimation, he said that presence of man-of-war was necessary. On 20th January I telegraphed to Bushire and Government of India that I thought it better to delay notification for the present. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire now telegraphs as follows, /th February :— “ Please see inclosures to my letter 12th January regarding Arabs at Henjam. Darya Begthas now returned from India.

Addressed to the Government of India. I have repeatedV:— v&gt; &gt; 3oa$/ju. The difficulty with the Arabs on Henjcm Island has risen from the foot that they regard themselves as subjects not of Persia hut of the British protected Chief of Behai. After we had re-established our telegraph station on the island in April 1904, (under a Concession from the late Shah of 1868) Sir A. Hardinge informed the Persian Covemment that *th*ere is no intention on the part of the 'Government of India to support any such claim (i.e. to 'Henjam) of the Chief of Behai, or to repudiate the 'authority of the Persian Government over Hen jam'. In July 1904 our local telegraph officials reported that the Arabs on the island had represented that they were subjects not of Persia hut of Behai and that if compelled they 'would resist tlui Persian Customs to the * 'utmost'. &gt; The Persian Government sent a Customs llirza to thte island in November 1904, and his arrival was followed by difficulties rising from his establishing quarters, hoisting the Persian flatt, etc., in such proximity to our J grfcd Telegraph buildings as to create ^practical inconvenience and confusion to ourselves, as'id incidentally to increase the feeling of the Arabs against the Persian officials. In December 1904 the Viceroy proposed to send guards to Hen jam, but action was deferred in consequence of representations Sir A. Hardinge. Since then there 'nos been a continual controversy with the Persian, Govern ment as to the Units to be assigned to the Telegraph Station, within which the Persian Customs could not trespass. Instructions were sent to Mr. Grant Duff on the 9th January 1906 that we regard the fact of our former1 oocupation from 1868 to 1880 as equivalent to a formal oonoession of the land then held by us. If the Persian Government aooept this, the difficult],! should solve itself. Meanwhile constant reports have been received frm Bushire that the excitement of the Arabs on the island is not cooling dovn. For instance, in April 1905, the Assistant Resident after visiting the island reported that if he told the Arabs that they could not look to us for protection they would attach the Persian Customs officials, and our telegraph officials vjould be exposed to serious danger. Again t on PA October 1905,he reported that the Arabs were as bitterly opposed to the Persians as ever, that what has Kept them quiet is 'a lingering hope that we shall eventually remove the Persian flagstaffs off is n the island'; that it is useless to continue Keeping the Arabs Uninformed as the longer the delatf in telling them L^ that we recognised Persian sovereignty, the greater will be their resentment against us. He added that 'there 'would be no risK to our telegraph officials in informing 'the Arabs that they could hope for nothing from the 'British Government ' if only - and this is the whole point 'the Persian Mudir was not, so to speaK, in the very 'shadow of the Telegraph Office.

The Foreign Department telegram Do. 4385 E.A., of the 1st December 1905, only reached me on return from tour on the 24th December 1905 and has not yet been acted upon; in the meantime further telegrams on the same subject have passed. In view of the unsatisfactory attitude of the Persian Government to British claims as reported by hr.

Main object of our resumption of former rights would thereby be nullified Situation is very similar to that of Jask in 1887 and suggests solution by similar methods. We would advocate conclusion of Agreement with Persian Government defining area of British telegraph station Within those limits no Persian buildings or flagstaffs would of course be erected. Outside they might be erected anywhere, or in any numbers, in return for such an agreement conceding reasonable area, we should be willing to convey formal recognition of Persian sovereignty over island to Arabs, to use our influence to tranquillize latter, and to abstain from sending military guard unless Persia does the same. If anangement is declined, we might say that despatch of guard will be necessary for protection of our station. Do you think an arrangement on these lines is feasible ? Removal of Persian flags from British demarcated area might further be explained by needs of signalling station. Result would be a British enclave on a Persian island.” Grant Duff’s reply, dated 28th September, is as follows :— “ Your telegram of 27th September. Hen jam. I am confident that Persian Government would oppose establishment of British enclave as proposed. Our best policy at present is, I think, that recommended in Hardinge’s Despatch No. 39, June 28th last, to Consul General, Bushire, copy of which was sent you. If His Majesty’s Government are prepared to threaten despatch of Indian guard to Henjam, probably Persian Government would consent to an arrangement on lines suggested, but mere diplomatic pressure would fail on account of the Shah’s and Grand Vizier’s suspicions of our doings in south Persia. As correspondence regarding Henjam was sent to Poreign Office, I would suggest that your telegram and my reply be repeated home.” Kirk’s memorandum, dated 22nd August, shows clearly the objections to permitting further encroachment on our station, and we trust Grant Duff may be authorised to effect settlement at Teheran on lines indicated in our telegram of 27th September, using, if necessary, threat of despatching guard, which he believes will be effective.No. 523, dated Bushire, the 5th (received 14th)November lf05 (C nfidential.)

No. C. 40, dated Bunder Abtas, the 24th October 1905 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant W. R. I. Shakespear, I.A., Assistant Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Bunder Abbas, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have honour to report for your information that on my arrival at Hen jam on the 14th October 1905, the Sheikh of that island came to me and again demanded that a reply should be given him as to his status. 2 . On coming on board the I. G. T. S. Patrick Stewart the Sheikh requested me to accord him a private interview, which I did. At this interview he bluntly pointed out that it was now some eight months since I had promised to give him an answer to his question as to whether he and his people were to be under British protection or Persian subjects, and asked also when it was proposed to remove the Persian Customs’ official and flagstaffs. He again vehemently explained that he and his people were firmly resolved not to permit Persian interference at any cost, and that it was because of his promise to me in Pebruary last that he had not allowed his people to remove the Persian Mudir, as they desired, in their own way. 3. I had a very long conversation with the Sheikh, in which he repeated all his previous arguments, and showed very plainly that he is every whit as determined not to have Persians on the island as he was last Pebruary. In accordance with your instructions all that I could do was to tell him that the matter was still under discussion and that he would harm no one so much as himself by permitting any open emeute. 4 . I would submit that I am placed in a most difficult position as regards Heniam ; although I am fully aware that the Sheikh has not the shadow of a hope of any British protection being extended to him of the kind that he desires vet time after time I have to fend him off by what is nothing less than prevarication. He has waited now patiently nine months for a detinite answer, and again I was only able to keep him quiet by pointing out how much he would damage his own case by not being able to restrain his people. 5. At the same time I would again bring to notice that what really has kept the Arabs quiet is a lingering hope that we shall eventually r ®® ov ® ,he Persian flagstafts off the island as we did in the case of Tamb and Abu Musa. I cannot attempt to destroy this idea without at once divulging 11 ----- the sligrhest hint that the whole there was no the immediate situation as it really exists, for on ^ likelihood of the Persian flagstaffs being entirely removed Question would he “If the Persian flagstaffs are not gomg to be removed, what is the British Government discussing and for what are we waiting ? fi In mv humble opinion it is useless to continue keeping the Arabs uninformed any longer as the longer the delay before they receive what must to them be an unfavourable answer the greater will be their resentment ; against ourselves.7 The laving of the new telegraph lire, in spite of repeated assurances in Kishm and elsewhere that it is for the Persian Government has given colour tnthe^idea that is only a question of time when the British Government will lakeover not only Hen jam but also Kishm Island. The Arabs of Kishm Spoke of this quite openly to me; how much greater strength the idea is likely to give to the hopes of the Henjam Arabs can he easily imagined. 8 There would be no risk to our telegraph officials in informing the Arabs that they could hope for nothing from the British Government it only— and this is the whole point-the Persian Mudir was not, so to speak, m the very shadow of the Telegraph Office. If it could he managed to delimitate our*boundaries at Henjam, remove the Mudir and the Persian fla^stafls clear outside thoss boundaries; and if this could all be done at a very enly cate, we might then tell the Arabs and let the Mudir take bis chance without-, I think, our officials running any very great risk. But I cannot too strong y uro , e that there is a very grave risk in giving the Sheikh the only possible answer under present circumstances, and these seem likely to continue ; on the other hand, the delay cannot be indefinitely prolonged. 9. The Sheikh has some 200 or more followers willing to go further than lie mio-ht perhaps himself, and what effect an unfavourable (and I may add an unexpected) answer is likely to have on such a mob of uneducated Asiatics, for whom their independence has been a burning question for the last nine months, needs no description ; I am not prepared to say how far they would go, nor whether they would respect the ties of hospitality which at present make them very good friends with our telegraph officials. 10. In my last interview I explained to the Sheikh that as he had waited eight months very patiently it would be foolish not to wait two or three months more. He agreed to wait, hut Government should be left in no doubt that the temper of the Arabs is not by any means the same as in lebruary or April last. 11 . Of course, in the event of an outbreak, the Arabs would soon be overcome by the Persian Government, but I am convinced the Persians will not establish their authority without some bloodshed. Although the Customs post was established at Henjam in Hecember 1904, it has so far not collected a single kran of duty from the Arabs, and on the few occasions that Persians have visited the Arab village they have been received churlishly, if not, threateningly.[ Confidential. ] No, 524, dated Bushire, the 5th (received 14th) November 1905.

These stores had only lately been landed. The Customs Mudir could give me no information why they were brought. As these stores are now ready, it is likely the Persians may commence building operations at any moment, so it would be as well that the limits of our station are clearly defined at an early date. 2588 r.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 27th August 1905 with enclosures dealing on affairs at Hen;)am. Before remarking on the points in the corres pondence affecting the Telegraph Department, I have to observe that there is no disposition on the part of the Telegraph staff in the island to champion Arab versus Persian rights and interests; strict in structions have been given to the Assistant supeiin— tendent in charge of the Telegraph Station to culti vate friendly relations with both parties and to re port for your information and disposal all matters occurring on the island of a political nature. Under the circumstances already known to you the position of the Assistant Superintendent and his staff, since the advent of the Persian oificials there, has been a difficult and a trying one. • With regard to the points raised affecting the Telegraph+ t have to remark that the chief Telegraph Department, - ca,,,, „! d! nioult.es «t He„ 3 a, arises non the fast that no limit. 01 occupation have teen l.xeh lor the 'Telegraph station' and until these are clearly flM d vie must expect annoyance Iron the Persian au thorities. » is clear Iron their proceedings on the island that they »tsh to he as close as possltle to n+ for tlie protection they think the Telegraph Station o-Ox - - this affords t-nem. nagstalls:- m the event o! pernlsslon helng attained for the Telegraph Station heconing a Lloyd's signal Station, the most convenient place for our flagstaff would he 50 yards to the eastward of the j peroanent hutldlnge and as It would m this position he in direct line with the Persian East Plagstoff effective signalling would he Interfered with; It would therefore be necessary to arrange for the re moval of this Flagstaff entirely or have It shifted „ a place closer to the seashore and on a dower level to ours. Customs Hut;- Its present position with regardto our temporary offices and camp is most incon veniently close and distinctly objectionable on sani tary grounds. The site for the permanent Customs buildings, as now selected by the Customs officials, has the same objections. This new site has no doubt been selected as they know our buildings will be completed shortly, and they want to come near ns for protection, as they did in the lirsu instance. For the objections mentioned above, I would strongly urge tlie O;.8to-s officials be urged to erect their building at least 400 yards from the Tele graph Station buildings in the direction of the vil lage. There is plenty of space in that direction. The other points raised (l) with reference to acquiring in time the limits of concession for the Telegraph Station by right of usage, (2) a sepoy guard for the protection of the station, and (3) 'Bast' being given to the Arabs at the station in case of actual oppression by the Persian are purely political considerations on which I can offer no opinion■ ii ^ opinion, but would venture to suggest that the pre cise position of the Telegraph Department in rela tion to these and rights of the Department and staff on the island should he clearly defined, when it will I hope, he x )0SS i'b3L e for friendly co-operation with the Persians. Under instructions from the Director-in-Chief o± this Department, I am at present in correspondence with the Persian Minister of Telegraphs at Tehran through the Director at that Station on the subject of starting work on the telegraphic connection be tween Henjam and Bunder Abbas. It is likely the work will be started in October, when it will be possi ble for me to visit Henjam and submit to you my final views on the matters at issue. As the Persian Government intend building a Telegraph Office on the Island, I could perhaps dur ing my visit fix on the site for this, in co-opera tion with the Persian officials.Paraphrase of telegram from the Government of D 27th India to Mr. Grant Duff September, 1905. R 28th The situation at Henjam is both undignified and inconvenient. It seems to us that a local settle ment allowing for the erection of Persian flagstaff© and buildings in close and undesirable proximity to the buildings of the British Telegraph Station is in admissible. Such a settlement would nullify the main object that we had in view in resuming our for mer rights. The situation at Jask in 1887 was very similar and the methods then adopted suggest them selves as being applicable in the present instance. Our suggestion is that the area of the British Tele- graph Station should be defined in an agreement con cluded with the Persian Government. Outside this area the Persian Government might erect buildings or flagstaffs in any number, but within its limits they would of course be prohibited. If a reasonable area were conceded by such an agreement we should be will ing to undertake not to send a guard unless the Per sians did the same, to convey to the Arabs a formal recognitionrecognition of Persian sovereignty over the island, and to use our influence in tranquillizing them. SiiOuld they decline to conclude such an agree ment, we might inform the Persian Government that,in order to protect our section, we shall be forced to despatch a guard to the island. Necessity for re moving Persian flagstaffs from British demarcated area might further be put down to needs of signalling station. Do you think that an arrangement on these lines, resulting in the formation of a British 'enclave' on a Persian island, is feasible?

Your Excellency:- I requested Abbas Kuli Khan to call on Your Excellency yesterday and draw your attention to the fact that a Persian builder and workmen arrived on the 20th instant at Henjam and announced their intention of erecting a building within the limits of the British concession. I instructed Abbas Kuli Khan to ask Your Excellency to be so good as to send orders to the local authorities to suspend the con struction of the building until the question of the limits of the British Concession could be formally settled between His Majesty’s Legation and the Persian Government. I understand that Your Excellency has laid my request before His Majesty the Shah. In accordance with the verbal promise I gave Your Excellency on Wednesday last, I transnit a map showing approximately the limits of the British Concession originally granted by the late Shah to 3 &gt;' A \ His Excellency the Mouchir ed DowlehI the Indo-European Telegraph Department. Your Excellency is doubtless av/are that before tne Henjam Office was closed in 1880 a considerable sum of money was spent by the Telegraph Department in con structing wells and in other respects improving the ground in the neighbourhood of the Office and in other parts of the Concession. The wells referred to are barely sufficient to supply the needs of our signallers and it will be impossible to supply from our tanks Persian Customs or other officials stationed on the island unless their number is very limited. The temporary Custom house now existing on the island, although it was constructed within the British Con cession without reference to His Majesty's Legation,does not I understand, interfere with the working of the telegraph Office; but as I have already had the honour to Inform Your Excellency the erection of the permanent building within our concession, on the site which has apparently been chosen, is strongly objected to, both on Departmental and sanitary grounds. The position now occupied by the Customs flag is also inconvenient. As Your Excellency is pro bably 0 1probably aware, the British Telegraph Office at Hen- jam is in future to be used as a signalling station for passing ships, and the present position of the Customs House flag will, it is considered, be likely to cause confusion. In these circumstances I have the honour to request Your Excellency to give instruc tions for the flag to be so placed as not to inter fere with our signalling arrangements. I have no doubt that the most convenient site for the flag could be settled locally by the British and Persian Officials. As His Majesty 1 s Government attach importance to an early settlement of the limits of the British concession at Henjam I request Your Excellency to be so good as to lay the matter before His Majesty the Shah and to inform me as soon as possible of the views of the Persian Government. (Signed) E. Grant Duff.Sir:- T am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne tc acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant relative to the British Telegraph- Station on Henjam Island. Lord Lansdowne has given the matter his careful consideration, in communication with His Majesty*s Minister at Tehran. Sir A. Hardinge adheres to the views expressed in his despatch to the Government of India No.39 of June 28th last. He agrees in the opinion of Mr. Grant Duff that the Persian Govern ment would oppose any arrangement tending to create a British enclave on Ken jam, as they are already sus picious of British designs on the island and their suspicions are steadily fostered by the Russian Le gation at Tehran. He admits that a show of force would probably induce the Persian, Government to yield The Under Secretary of State, India Office.&gt;6 yield in the matter, hut he doubts if the results of such action would justify the suspicions and diffi culties which it would inevitably arouse. Lord Lansdowne is, on the whole, disposed to concur in Sir A. Hardinge's view. His Lordship would suggest, for Mr. BrodriciHs consideration, that further efforts should be made to settle the matter locally, but that, if the amenities of the Telegraph Station are seriously affected by Persian encroach ments, Mr. Grant Duff should be instructed to ad dress a protest to the D ersian Government.

Sir Arthur Hardinge advo cated that some agreement should, if possible, be come to with the local Persian authorities as to the limits of the telegraph station at Henjam. He thought we could successfully prevent the erection of any new buildings, not authorised by us, within the boundary of our old station limits by a protest, which / if disregarded^ few of our Sepoys at Bushire might be sent to enforce. It will be noticed that in this arrangement there is a possibility admitted of allowing the erection of some Persian buildings within our boundary.

' ^ The Government of India do not accept the view that the case ✓ ✓ admits of local settlement.

If this arrangement is declined hy the Persian Govern ent we are to inform that Government that the despatch of a guard will he necessary for the protection of our station. Mr Grant Puff is of opinion that this threat will he sufficient prohahly to obtain the consent of the Persian Government to the p-r-ssant proposal of the Indian Government. He considers mere diplomatic pressure would fail to help us. In the circumstances, as an early settlement of the case is most desirable, the course of action advised hy the Indian Government would appear to he the best to bring about the desired result. 13th October,1905( 5 FOREIGN SECRET TELEGRAMS.

Following sent to Tehran 27th September ‘ Henjam situation, which is both inconvenient and undignified, does not seem to us to admit of local settlement, allowing for erection of Persian buildings and flagstaff’s in close and undesirable proximity to British telegraph buildings. Main object of our resumption of former rights would thereby be nullified. Situation is very similar to that of Jask in 1887 and suggests solution by similar methods. We would advocate conclusion of Agreement with Persian Government defining area of British telegraph station. Within those limits no Persian buildings or flagstaffs would of course be erected. Outside they might be erected anywhere, or in any numbers. In return for such an agreement cm island to Arabs, to use our influence to tranqu from sending military guard unless Persia does tl “ If arrangement is declined, we might say that despatch of guard will be necessary for protection of our station. Do you think an arrangement on these lines is feasible ? Removal of Persian flags from British demarcated area might further be explained by needs of signalling station. Result would be a British enclave on a Persian island.” Grant Duff’s reply, dated 28th September, is as follows :— “ Your telegram of 27th September. Henjam. I am confident that Persian Government would oppose establishment of British enclave as proposed. Our best policy at present is, I think, that recommended in Hardinge’s Despatch No. 39, June 28th last, to Consul General, Bushire, copy of which was sent you. If His Majesty’s Government are prepared to threaten despatch of Indian guard to Henjam, probably Persian Government would consent to an arrangement on lines suggested, but mere diplomatic pressure would fail on account of the Shah’s and Grand Vizier’s suspicions of our doings in south Persia. As correspondence regarding Henjam was sent to Foreign Office, I would suggest that your telegram and my reply be repeated home.” Kirk’s memorandum, dated 22nd August, shows clearly the objections to permitting further encroachment on our station, and we trust Grant Duff may be authorised to effect settlement at Teheran on lines indicated in our telegram of 27th September, using, if necessary, threat of despatching guard, which he believes will be effective. should be willing to convey formal recognitionir 1—111 mu ' Minute Paper.

I have delayed returning these papers until could consult the Birector of Telegraphs of the Persian GUlf Seci - 10n &gt; now at home on leave, on the questions that have heen raised in them. He has been all over the ground at Henjam some months ago, and I had also some personal knowledge of it before our telegraph office was reopened there. Sir Arthur Hardinge points out that Henjam being Persian territory the Persian Government have an undeniable right to place a Customs House and Coast guard there. The quest-ion however arises whether it can be claimed that this building and the officials connected with it should be located within the bounds of the British concession. We are told that the Director of Customs at Bunder Abbas has invited tenders for the erection of a substantial building at Henjam. There seems every probability that^unless a protest is made, this building will be put up inside the British concession without reference' to the Telegraph authorities as to its site. The correspondence shows that the Persian officials appear to think they can erect flagstaffs and buildings on the British Telegraph station where they please. We have now obtained authority to connect Henjam vith Bunder Abbas so that the doubt about obtaining this / concession imi Tii-rui1riin; the above extension need not stand in the way of clearing up the position at Henjam,more particu larly as regards the limits of the Telegraph Station there^ ind the powers of the local Persian officials to encroachon them. Int map that accompanies the correspondence shows \ t ' ie 0:r the Telegraph station at Henjam when the office was closed there in 1880. We may fairly claim that / on our reopening the Telegraph station there we have the right to reoccupy the same ground. So far the Persian tj.fici.als appear only to have erected a temporary Customs House and some temporary Customs shelters within the boundary of the British Telegraph station. The site they have cnosen i or these does not, it is 'believed, inconvenience any telegraph arrangements, and is possibly the best site in the island for the purposes of a Customs House as ships visiting Henjam usually anchor off this part of the coast. Por these reasons and as a matter of courtesy we might agree to the Customs House remaining within the limits of the Telegraph station provided only a limited number of men were employed in it. As to the Customs flagstaff it should be placed as is usual in the neighbourhood of the customs House. In its present position it will possibly interfere with the working of the flagstaff, that has to be erected so that the Henjam telegraph office may be made a Lloyd’s signalling station, which has been ordered. If the Persian Government desire to continue to fly their flag inside the boundaries of the Telegraph station, there appears to be no particular objection to this, and probably its present situation will not interfere with our ship . signalling for Lloyd’s. Itt . It has to he remembered that a considerable portion ol tne ground within the limits of the British Telegraph Station forms the catchment area for the rain that is ^^ollected in the water tanks* To allow the Persian official! with their followers and animals a free use of this ground would completely ruin the v/ater supply of the Telegraph es tablishment* Sir Arthur Hardinge has expressed himself as doubtful whether it would be judicious at this moment to put forward a formal claim that the limits of the Telegraph station are as shown in the map. If however our claim to this area cei were question^later on, he considers we could successfully prevent the erection of any new building not authorised by us by the despatch, if our protest was disregarded, of a few Sepoys from Bushire. The reply to the Foreign Office might perhaps be that the Secretary of State agrees generally with Sir A.Hardinge’s views^but he considers that our claim to the whole of the old area of the British Telegraph station should be made immediately any other question arises of Persian officials attempting to erect any structure whether permanent or temporary within its limits. 1^ might oe added that instructions had been given to the Director in Chief of the Telegraph Department to enjoin his local staff at Henjam to co-operate in a friendly spirit with the Persian officials there.The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the - JjUu.

Ify Lord:- I have the honour to transmit herewith copies of telegrams, as marked in the margin, and of a despatch addressed hy me to His Majesty’s Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject of affairs at Henjam. I have at the same time the honour to in close a copy of a note received hy me from Mr. Nans in reply to representations which I had made to him on the impropriety of the language alleged in Major Cox* telegram Mo. 85 to have been used at Henj am by Mr. St as, but which, from rry slight personal acquain tance with that officer, who is a quiet and concili atory person, I am inclined to think must have been misrepresented, especially if he spoke through an Arab interpreter. I am asking Major Cox however, to enquire into and report fully on the facts. The relations between the Indo-European Telegraph Department's Agent and the Customs Author! ties The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., SgC ., &amp;c., &amp;C.Authorities at Henjani have beer from the beginning rather unfortunate. The former resented the appear ance on the island of a Persian Customs Official and assumed, I think without adequate justification, that his sole function was to spy on the doings of the Telegraph Staff and involve it in difficulties with the Arabs. He therefore obtained permission from the Government of India to refuse to allow the Customs I'irza to draii water from the tanks adjacent to the telegraph office, which, originally construct ed by the Portuguese, had been repaired by the tele graph Staff during its occupation of Henjam in the reign of the late Shah, hoping thereby to drive him from the island as he could not, owing to the Hos tility of the Arabs, obtain water or supplies from their village. The result has been a certain amount of fric tion which can, I think, only be terminated oy a recognition on our part that, Henjam being Persian territory, the Persian Government have an undeniable right''tMi ■ iJinbot € right-to place a Customs House and Coast guard on the island, and hy friendly co-operation between the two administrations. I have very little doubt that I shall be able to persuade Monsieur Naus to send in structions conceived in this spirit to Monsieur Stas and that these incidents will prove a merely tempor ary cause of reciprocal irritation. I have &amp;c., (For the Minister) (Signed) Evelyn Grant Duff.Copy. No.39. { ^ULAHE K, June 28 th, 1905. Sir: - I have received and considered your despatch No.59 of the 2nd instant respecting affairs at Hen- jam. It suggests to me the following observations. Persian sovereignty being unquestionable at Hen- jam, our wisest plan appears to be to recognise it, with all its consequences, in an ungrudging spirit. Some of these consequences, such as the presence of the Customs Mirza, may be disagreeable and inconven ient, but I do not believe that we shall render them less so by such measures as trying to starve, the Mirza out by cutting off his water supply, or dis playing resentment at the presence oi Persian flags, or encouraging the Arab villagers to believe that we sympathise with their dislike of Persian authority. It was inevitable when we reestablished our telegraph station at Henjam that the attention of the Govern- Major Cox, C.I„E. &amp;C ., &amp;C • j w . me ntGovernment at Tehran should he directed to that is' lend and that a Customs bureau and Persian flag should he planted there, as has heen done at Sirri Ilf' i where there are not, as at nenjoin, any foieign ±e J sldents, much less any foreign oixlcials. Ij- ''-- e Arabs resent this state of things and threaten ven geance on our telegraph station as its cause, then it seems to me that our only course is to explain politely hut quite plainly to the Sheikh that what ever view he may hold as to the legal rights over Henjam of the Chief of Debai, the British Government recognises it like Kishm as being a part of Persia, that it will not therefore, as it did in the case || 0 f Tumb and Abu Musa, insist on the lowering of the Persian flags and that it warns the Arabs as their friend that if they resist Persian authority or at tack the telegraph or Customs officials, the only result will he that Persian troops will be sent to the island and that we may have to bring there a Sepoy guard. It is probable that if this is made quite clear to the Arab villagers they will bow to the inevitableinevitable, but if they do not, and if the Customs I'drza or one of our own telegraph staff is assaulted they will in the end get the worst of it, as in the lirst Instance the Persians will doubtless send over from Lingan or Bunder Abbas a detachment of ragged serbazee sufficiently well armed to suppress them, and in the latter case we shall have a justification for sending a few Sepoys there, without affording the Persian Government a pretext for refusing us further telegraph concessions on the ground that these sooner or later Involve an Indian military occupation on Persian soil. For the reasons above stated I should deprecate any petty conflicts between our officials and those of the Persian Government about flag staffs, sites of huts &amp;c., or any appearance of a disposition on the part of the telegraph staff to champion Arab versus Persian rights and interests. With respect to the various details with which your despatch deals I would recommend that you should discuss them with the Director General of Customs at Bushire IV'BusMre and endeavour to come to an agree sn ., would te referred to Monsieur Naus and to myself, anywhich if the former approved of it would doubt less be confirmed by the Persian Government. It would probably be simpler to deal with Mr. Heynssens thfin with the Darya Beggi since the latter would be afraid as in the matter of the Consular site at Bunder Abbas to recommend your proposals here icr - ear of being suspected of having been overreached or bribed by you, and an European would more easily appreciate objections which you might make on sanitary or other practical grounds. As regards (l) flagstaffs, it is not proualle that the telegraph superintendent will be consulted unless he volunteers an opinion and points out ade quate reasons for not placing the flagstaffs in a particular position. If it can be shown that the flags or flagstaffs interfere with signalling opera tions, that would be a good reason for requesting that they should be shifted, but unless some such ground as this exists, it is difficult to see why we should object to their presence. You observe thatthat two flagstaffe are superfluous am that one should be eliminated but I should not have thought i that it made any difference whether one or several Persian flags flew on Henjam. The flag is the symbol of Persian sovereignty, and its reduplication, how ever frivolous, has no significance to which we can take exception. (2) Customs hut. If any practical objection exists, as I gather is the case, to the present site of the Customs hut, I would suggest your asking Mr. Heynssens to remove it elsewhere, rather than at tempt yourself to remove it by force and thus raise in a form prejudicial to ourselves, the entire ques tion of the limits of the telegraph concession. I pointed out in an official note some time ago, ad dressed by me to the Persian Government, tha^ the present site was inconvenient to the telegraph offi cials and I will mention that matter again, but the Persian Foreign Office will only refer it to Monsieur Naus and I think therefore that it had better, if possible, be settled local! .y iDG'tWBS HeynssensHey ns s e ns and yours eIf. Darya Beggi's mat shelters. Unless the erection of a permanent building on the site occu. pied by these shelters is in itself objectionable from our point of view I should not attempt to inter fere with the action of the Persian authorities as it does not matter to us whether the sites they select for their buildings are the most suitable or nou. If the erection of the building is positively incon venient to the telegraph officials, the Darya Beggi ould doubtless be persuaded by you, on this being explained to him, to select another site. ( 4 ) The building mentioned by His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas is probably a permanent resi dence, either for the Customs official or for the telegraph clerks v/hom the Persian Government propose sending to Henjam when the line to Bunder Abbas is completed. A more important question is that of the limits of the concession and I agree with you in thinking it desirable that the whole area shown on your map.up 1,0 the suggested southern boundary should be in- e xii cl eel v/iihin them. I am not sure , however, that it would be judicious at this moment to put forward a formal claim. It would be best first to put such part of the area as is capable of it under cultiva tion, complete the repairs to the wells and the tanks and then quietly enclose the whole or place boundary marks along the southern border. If, owing to the telegraph line to Bunder Abbas or to the opening of a quarantine station Henjaxn became a more important place and our claim to this area were questioned lat er on, we could point both to the earlier record cited by you and to our redelimitation as conclusive evidence of a right derived from usage, and could, I think, successfully prevent the erection of any new building not authorised by us within these limits by the despatch, if our protest was disregarded, of a few of your Sepoys from Bushire to enforce it. But it would, I think, be desirable at this stage quietly to build up your 'accomplished fact' before challeng ing a discussion with the Persian Government. Thelatter will in any case I Imagine, even if v/e enclose am cultivate up to the Southern boundary maintain that it cannot he precluded from erecting structures on the actual foreshore, this being in its view an inherent and inalienable sovereign attribute. It could probably, however, be induced to desist from erecting such structures north of the village if I were able to satisfy it that the telegraph officials had valid and sufficient grounds, unconnected with political considerations, for objecting to them. Generally speaking I believe the system which will be found most advantageous in the interests of our station at Henjan is to endeavour to settle all these questions as far as possible on the spot in a spirit of friendliness and co-operation with the Persian authorities, assisting the latter in return wherever we can and avoiding any appearance of regarding Per sian rights in Henjam with illwill or of seeking, for political objects, to curtail them. Our Russian friends will not fail to suggest to the Persians that we have political designs on the island and any indi cations on our part of protesting against the Persian flagi2.ag as unnecessary or protecting the Arabs against tne Persians will be regarded, by an already suspici ous people as confirming the truth of these sugges tions. No doubt if the Persians reject our friendly overtures and adopt an obstructive attitude we may be compelled to have recourse to different methods, but I think that such extreme steps as the forcible deportation of the Customs Mirza to another part of the island should not be contemplated until all the resources of pacific diplomacy have been exhausted. If the Customs Mirza bears any resemblance to most of his species I should have imagined that it would have been very easy to prevail on him by a small present of money not merely to abstain from ob structing, but cordially to co-operate in the objects of the telegraph staff, and that this in the long run would prove the most economical course. I am &amp;c., (Signed) A.H.Hardinge. PS I have not anticipated in this despatch the contingency of actual oppression of the Henjarn ArabsArabs by Persian officials, as distinct from the more legitimate presence of a Persian Customs Officer and flag. Should such oppression occur, the Telegraph Superintendent would be justified in allow ing the villagers to take 'bast' in his station, as has often happened in places in the inferior o± |j Persia, and this would give me a ground for demanding here that the grievances of the natives of Henjam should be redressed.4 Copy. No.59. Sir: - B U S H I R E, 2nd June, ISO5. I have the honour to submit the report regarding the position at Henjam promised in rry telegram of the 1st instant, to you and that of the Foreign Depart ment, Simla. I proceeded to the island from Muscat taking Lieutenant Shakespear with me and gave the telegraph Superintendent a day's notice of our corning. The Sheikh of the Arab village did not put in an appearance, but I learnt from the Telegraph Superin- tendent that most of his villagers were on the point oi leaving for the pearl fisheries and were no douht busy with their preparations. I left a note for him saying that I was sorry to have missed him, but that in any case I was confident that until he had had an opportunity of meeting myself or His Britannic majes ty's Consul,Bunder Abbas, he would as heretoiore abide Sir A.Hardinge, K.C.B. &amp;c., &amp;c. , &amp;c *abide by the advice of the Telegrapn Superintendent. This note and the fact that most of the Araos will now be away pearling will, I think, obviate any dan ger of a breach of the peace arising on the island for some weeks to come. The Customs representative, who was there when we arrived, was a new man (the third incumoent), and had only been installed two or three days before, his predecessor having suddenly fallen ill and navxng had to leave hurriedly for Bunder Abbas. Lieutenant Shakespear had already informed the Director of Customs at Bunder Abbas that we could no longer supply their representative on the island with water from our meagre store and the new Ivliraa was duly informed to that effect by the Telegraph Super intendent in writing on May 25th. As a matter of fact the man had already made an arrangement by which a Persian brings him over water by boat daily from the opposite settlement of Derishtan in Kishm. This is only possible in fair weather, but the Mirza will no doubt be able to accumulate a sufficient quantity of water to provide against a few days stoppage of - supplysupply owing to occasional heavy seas in the straits. The Telegraph Superintendent had taken for granted that the Mirz-a on ceasing to he supplied from our tanks would he thrown on the mercy of the Arabs, hut this is evidently not going to he the case and it is clear that nothing short of expulsion from our set tlement will prevent him from sheltering himself in the shadow of our presence. For the reasons before explained however, for the next few weeks or at any rate until this report has reached higher authority, matters are likely to remain quiescent, supposing that no fresh element of unrest he introduced. I have now the honour to record the present situation in regard to one or two matters of detail and to request consideration of them and such action as may he deemed necessary. (I) Plagst&amp;ffs. At present we have no flag- staffs anywhere on the Telegraph st&amp;eion, wnn o^s the Persians rejoice in two, vide sketch map attach ed; one of which I will call (a) 200 yards to the east of our station and the other (h) about 400 yardto the west ot it and known as the Customs flagstaff. From both of these the Persian flag is now flown, though up to the return to the island last year no Persian flag had ever been hoisted on it. The erection of (a) in its present position was reported in Residency telegram dated 3rd January 1905 and the Minister in his telegram of 14th Janu ary replied that he was suggesting to the Persian Government that some arrangement should be come to between our telegraph clerk and the local officials as to the position of the said flagstaff. He has not however since been consulted. The Persian flag commenced to be flown from it on the 14th October 1904. Flagstaff (b) was erected by the Director Gen eral of Customs during his visit to Henjam on 20th November 1904. It was set up on an elevated spot overlooking cur telegraph buildings, and was planted among some masonry debris which are averred by old servants of the Telegraph Department who served there at the time of our former occupation to be the remains of the quarters occupied by Mr. Floyer, one of the TelegraphTelegraph stall. The present Superintendent was not consulted in any way as to the position chosen. In connection with these flagstalls, when visiting Bunder Alohas recently, the Darya Begi inlorm ed Lieutenant Shakeepear that he thought the Govern ment llagstall might he shifted north-eastwards to the sea shore, hut that the Customs flag would remain where it was. (II) Customs Hut. For position see sketch map. This was alec a point with regard to which the Minister in his telegram of January 14th suggested that an arrangement should he come to between our Telegraph clerk and the local officials, hut no local official appeared at Henjarn to consult our Telegraph Superintendent and the Belgian Customs administration had the hut erected where it pleased them, without reference to him. The Director Persian Gulf Tele graphs objects to its position. (HI) Quite recently preparatory to his visit to Henjam the Darya Begi had two mat shelters run up at the landing place for his own use and this spotv [ is now suggested as the probable site which the Per sian authorities have their eye upon for a permanent building and there is in any case no tangible evi dence at present to support the above surmise. (IV) On the other hand His Male sty* s Consul at Bunder Abbas reports on good authority that the Director of Customs has invited tenders for the erec tion of a substantial building on Henjam, and that one well-known merchant gave a tender for £000 tomans. That figure was considered too high and the Director is said to be anxious to get it done for 2500 tomans. It is not known for what purpose such a building is contemplated; whether for Customs premises or for a -telegraph office. Having recorded the foregoing items of fact or information I respectfully invite a scrutiny of the accompanying sketch map. The first thing to be done before any questions of site can be satisfactorily considered seems to be for us to decide what limits we are in a position to claim for the 'British Tele graph Station'. I submit that on our old record we cancan claim irorn the northern shore of the Island hack to the cliff line on the southern side of the valley containing our cultivation, and along that boundary east and west from sea to sea, as shewn by the red line in the sketch map. In the time of our former occupation v/e seem to have held this much undisputed- ly* furthermore a considerable amount of British money was spent on the maintenance and the erection of the numerous rain water reservoirs on the rocky ground north of the va!3,ey and round the plinth, and in the valley itself an industrious British community excavated numerous wells and thereby kept under cul tivation a considerable tract of ground. Tnis culti vation has been restarted and the tract supplies its own evidence of our previous occupation. The present Superintendent has done a good deal in the way o± clearing out wells, making bunds and planting date palms. A small crop of grain has even been sown and gathered this season under his direction. It seems important therefore if we are going to maintain the station on Henjam, that we should not forego our claimclaim to this cultivated tract, if only to give a little distraction and interest in life to our Tele graph Staff. The next, point for consideration seerns to he this: Supposing we are in a position to claim for the British Telegraph station the limits indicated above, what does the substantiation of that claim Involve? How far can we prevent the Persian Government from taking up sites within those limits without our con currence? and within what limits can we talk of M encroachment on our ground” vide Minister’s telegram of 14th January 1905. In this connection I understand it to be the view of the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs from a departmental standpoint that in any case no struc tures, buildings or flagstaffs should be allowed to the north of a line passing east and west through the village shewn on the sketch map. I presume we shall at least endeavour to secure this. Then as to the present and future position of the Persian Flagstaffs; in the first place it seems unnecessaryunnecessary and gratuitous that there should he two tlagstatle perched one on each side of our new tele graph buildings under construction. One should he eliminated. If (a) is to remain, there seems no par- ticu3.ar objection to its present site, for a flag staff only, but if it is intended to mark a site for Customs quarters as is said to be the case, I agree with the Assistant Superintendent in thinking that the site is open to objection as apart from the fact that it looks down on our buildings the drainage from it would run down a gully to one of the newly repair ed water reservoirs and befoul it. I may mention that the village shewn on the plan consists merely of four or five mud tenements and a few more thatched huts. Ordinarily I believe they are as often as not unoccupied. At present they are tenanted by labourers working on our telegraph build ing or menials of the Telegraph establishments. The building shewn as the Hoin-ut-Tuj jar* s go down is merely a mud tenement built and used by the Mo in' s agent or farmer when there is any export of salt go inggoing on. There are still some earthy heaps of salt lying on the shore as shewn in the plan, said to be long to the Mo in's man. I trust that the foregoing observations, read by the light of the plan, will make the actual posi tion clear and will enable the Government of India and His Majesty's Legation to come to a definite decision as to what line it is expedient for us to adopt both with regard to the limits of our Telegraph Station and other points dealt with in the foregoing.

Consul's report as to the attitude of the Arabs shows that the establishment of Customs Mirza is, as we anticipated, seriously impairing our relations with them, and the safety of the Telegraph station may even be endangered. We do not see moreover why any responsibility should be assumed by us for the safety or subsistence of an official whose sole raison d'etre upon the island is to spy upon us. Might it not be advisable under these circumstances to inform Persian Government that they must either permit us to station an Indian guard there for the protection of our men or remove the Mirza at once from the neighbourhood of the station, (this would be tantamount to withdrawing him from the island alto gether)? . The latter alternative would, in our opinion, be preferable, as it would dispense with a cosily guardguard and, by restoring the status quo, re-establish our prestige with the Arabs. In our opinion the present position is thoroughly unsatisfactory and might easily develop into a situation which we our selves would regret no less than the Persian Govern ment . Paraphrase of Sir A.Hardinge*s telegram No.89 to India, May 7th, 1905. Henjam. The answer of the Persian Government to a request for the removal of the Mirza or for an Indian guard to protect our station will undoubtedly be an offer to send Persian troops to protect both. Matters would scarcely be improved by this. Need we go out of our v/ay to protect the Mirza? If the Arabs were to threaten to kill him perhaps he would leave the island without waiting for Monsieur Naus* orders. A similar thing happened on the Transcas pian frontier.

I agree with opinion expressed by Telegraph Superintendent, with whom I have been in communication, that simplest plan is for him to inform Customs Mirza in writing that he cannot be permitted any longer to draw water from our tanks as the supply is low.

The two Persian Ilagstaffs meanwhile remain in positions which are open to objection and to which we have not agreed. At Bunder Abbas moreover tenders are being invited for some building on the island. Your Excellency may think it expedient, pending the receiptreceipt of my report, to inform Persian Government that we must he consulted as to the site for the contemplated building and as to the final position of their flagstaffs. Paraphrase of Sir A.Hardinge's telegram to Bushire No.56, June 2nd, 1905. Unless position of Persian flagstaff is practi cally inconvenient to our office for telegraphic pur poses we ca n h ardly dictate to Persian Government as to where they are to place it and I think we should carefully avoid suggesting that we regard with un friendly eyes the Persian sovereignty over the island. As condition of extension of telegraph line to Bunder Addas Shah insisted on having a Persian telegraph office on the island and this is perhaps the build ing for which tender is Invited.

I understood that we had had to refuse water to the Customs Mirza for fear of trouble with the natives from whom he was in fear of his life. It would seem on the other hand that it is the natives who are afraid of him. His unfriendly action is explicable under the circumstances, for it is pro bably due to our having cut off his water. I hard ly think we could forcibly deport an official of the Persian Government from Persian territory. I would suggest your informing Director General that his latest demand is inadmissible and that we shall notnot consider ourselves bound to permit his continued residence on our station land out of courtesy to the Persian Government if he acts in a vexatious manner. Paraphrase 01 telegram from Rushire to Sir A. Hardinge, No.85, June 28th 1905. The Superintendent of Telegraphs at Hergam tele graphs as follows 'On June 25th, the Director of Customs at Bunder Abbas proceeded on the Customs steamer to Henjam and visited the Arab village. The male population were away at the pearl fisheries and only a few men re mained in charge of the women. The IDirector invited a Persian of Kishm, who lives among the Arabs, to be come Persian Customs Mudir of the village. A house and a flagstaff were to be erected for him, as had been done on the North side of the island, and he was to have a salary of 2,000 krans a year. The Director continued that it was not intended to levy Customs duties, hut that these measures were necessary in order to prevent the English laying claim to the islandisland later on'. I shall he glad of early instructions as to what reply I am to give to the Aral Sheikh, who is expected from the-Pirate Coast in a few days, should he refer to me or to Mr. Shakespear. Our re-occupation of the Telegraph station should not alter the status quo to the prejudice of these Arabs and I submit that it is incumbent on us to make sure that it does not do so. (Signed) Cox.

If we ask for the removal of the Mirza or for establishment of an Indian guard to protect our station, Persian Government will undoubtedly reply with an offer to send Persian troops for the security of both. This will not improve matters. Perhaps the Customs Mirza would leave the island without waiting for instruc tions from Monsieur Naus if the Arabs were to threaten to kill him. This has happened on the Trans-Caspian frontier. Do you think we need go. out of our way to protect the Mirza?

Tho Government of India understand that the Reglement ouanier is not yet settled. If so, could not the Persians nsert a post at uenjam ? The objection to this post is &gt;ased, firstly, on the maintenance of status„fluo, as sustoms nave not hitherto heon levied; cocondly on the “act that the Persian Coast is already adequately protected 3 y Customs posts against contraband importations from ienjam and local trade on the island would not warrant tn. sjstablisnment of a post there; thirdly, that it might lead to regrettable friction with the telegrapn officials; and lastly, that it would probably cause disturbances and trouble with local Arabs that by endangering the safety of the telegraph station might compel the nritish Govern- me iit to tahe measures for its protection, as at Cnarbur wnicn it is desirable to avoid. You will remember that Arab Sheika threatened resistance to r, Persian authority over them, and the imposition of tax ation on uis kinsmen as direct result of re-establish ment of a uritish telegraph station might react injurious- ly on our relations witn D#bai.

I have the honour to refer to previous correspondence from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to your address regarding the difficult state of affairs at Henj am and the restlessness of the Arab inhabitants of the island. During the recent tour of His Excellency the Naval Commandcr- in-Chief, I discussed the position at Hcnjam with His Excel lency. I explained to His Excellency that owing to the erec tion of Persian flag staffs and the institution of a Persian Customs bureau on the island,the Arabs had realised that they were being brought unuer Persian rule; that during my tour in February last the Sheikh had spoken to n® of his intention of never acknowledging Persian sovereignty and that he had requested British protection; that I had succeeded in ob taining a promise from the Sheikh that there should be no trou' ble of disturbance until I either wrote to him or came per sonally to see him after receding an answer to the referenci of his case which i promised to make; that the Arabs had nownow begun to suspect us of colluding with the Persian Government in some nefarious design on the island, in con sequence of the Customs inspector living near the telegraph station and receiving from the telegraph officials water, which the Arabs had refused him. During the halt of the squadron at Ilorumz, the Agent of the LIoin-ut-Tujar at Tehran (who leases these islands on the part of the Gulf) can® on board the flagship to pay his respects. Hen jam being within this official*s jurisdiction and as I had already spoken to him regarding the removal of the flagstaff to another site, I requested \ His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief to receive this of- further ficial as a matter of policy hoping thereby to still/induce him to carry out the removal. His Excellency received the Agent and later in the afternoon was escorted by him when visiting the Horfoz Fort. His Excellency spoke to the Agent and explained the difficulty of the situation at Henjam, surge sting that to avoid trouble with the Arabs, all flag staffs should be removed entirely. ■ The Agent said } e would do his best. I would now bring to your notice that the Captain of H.M.3. 'Prosc&amp;pine ' who was at Henjam a few days ago and apparently had some conversation with the Arabs, informedne that they were very restless and that the telegraph officials were in a most insecure, not to say, dangerous position. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in formed me in reply to my original report that there was no question of Henjam being other than Persian soil; I have accordingly to inform the Sheikh that ho is a Persian sub ject and that we can have no further dealings with him poli tically. Being anxious to avoid any conflict on the island I have so far said nothing to the Sheikh but the dolay can not be indefinite; I shall be compelled to inform him within a fortnight or three weeks. I am apprehensive that on receipt of the news that they can no longer look to us for protection the Arabs Persian will come down and kill the/Customs official and perhaps any other they may find on the xsland; it will be seen how very dangerous is the position of the telegraph officials. The Arabs have sworn never to acknowledge the Persians as their masters and I firmly beliwve have every intention of keeping their word. So far it has bean entirely due to our in fluence with then that the Persian Customs official has existed as long as lie has. I would request instruction by telegram before I proceed^ ■ 4 • proceed to Henjam to irforn the Sheikh of his position.

I have not acted upon this despatch. I did not interview the Arabs when I visited Hen jam a month ago and I derived th® impression that danger of any actual breach of peace was over estimated, as the Superintendent least did not display the iBXfc anxiety for the safety of th® telegraph staff. I will, however, maintain vigilance. I do net think any harm is likely to arise from delaying to go to the Shtikh if there is any likelihood of an early settlement of the cable question and the despatch of a sepoy guard, and I would suggest Lieutt. Shakespear being instructedto avoid going then® for th@ presan t except in the case of emergency, and inform the Sheikh, if applied to, that he has placed his reprcsentation before Government and is await ing instructions,- if it is considered undesirable delay in timation. I agree that the terms suggested by Shakespear t© go too far.

THE Molitashem-es-Sultaneli, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, called on me on tlie 26tli ultimo, on behalf of the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, and read me a telegram from the Darya Begi, Governor of the Gulf Ports, reporting that the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s officials at Henjam had removed the Persian flag and hoisted the British flag over the ruins of the old telegraph station reoccupied by them. He added that the Persian Government wished for explanations as to these proceedings, which t ley evidently regarded, to judge by his remarks, as indicating a disposition on our part to question the Shah’s sovereign rights over the island, and as having, in connection with the recent incident respecting Tamb and Abumusa, some possible political signincance. I replied that I would telegraph for information to His Majesty’s Acting Resident at Bushire, but that I was convinced that no political significance need be deemed to attach to any steps taken by the telegraph officials. It was possible that the flagstafl might have been removed for building purposes ; the Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh could, however, assure the Mushir-ed-Dowleh from me that we had no intention of challenging the fena s On receipt of the inclosed telegram from Major Cox, I addressed to the Persian Government the note of which I have the honour to inclose a copy herewith, and which embodies the views expressed by the Government of India m a telegram received y me on this subject on the 20th April last. , • r In this telegram the Government of India observed that our ^occupation of Heniam should not be made a pretext for disturbing the status quo there by ® duction of Persian officials, and Major Cox, m reporting a rumour Customs Department intended to place a post there, suggested that we ^ght ob ect to their doing so I do not see how we can well remonstrate against such a n e . , sranh station with an European staff, is reopened on Henjam, and if ships, as is prob- fbirtakf to caB ng there.

Major Cox to Sir A. Hardinge. (Telegraphic.) P. ‘ Bushire, July 2, 1904. FLAGS at Henjam. I have ascertained that statement that our telegraph officials removed the Persian and hoisted the British flag is unfounded. The position is still that described in Government of India’s telegram to you of the 20th April; the original Persian flagstaff still stands on our plinth, and no British flag has been hoisted. As to flags at other places, I beg to report that our telegraph stations at Task, Gwadur, and Bushire all have regular official flagstaffs with signalling yards, and are entitled to fly flag. 2 understand that there has never been a Persian flag on Henjam, but only a pole on a plinth over the British station, which was erected some years ago by the Malik-ut-Tujjar after an unsuccessful attempt to raise it on the south coast of the island. The erection of this flag and pole was resisted at the time by the local Arabs on the ground that Henjam belongs to the Sheikh of Bahai, one of the six Arab Chiefs on the south coast of the Persian Gulf, who are under the protection of the Government of India. Their is no intention on the part of the Government of India to support any such claim on the part of the Sheikh of Bahai or to repudiate the authority of the Persian Government over Henjam. r Should it, therefore, as probably will be the case, be necessary to remove the pole in order to complete the building, such removal need in no way be regarded as having any political significance, more especially as it would not be the flag, but merely a flagless pole which would be taken away for necessary building purposes, and which coifld, if needed, be re-erected elsewhere. Should a flag be eventually flown at Henjam it will be similar to those which have been flown for many years past with the consent of the Persian Government at other telegraph stations on the coast, such as Jask Gwadur and Bushire, and which, I may mention parenthetically, are necessary for signalling purposes, and cannot be regarded as having a political object. I trust that these explanations may prove satisfactory to your Excellency. I need scarcely add that His Britannic Majesty’s Government has never denied the sovereignty of Persia over Henjam, as is shown by the fact that our occupation is derived by the concession granted to us by His Majesty the late Shah. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARBINGE..2 Neither of these channels, both of which I have personally visited, have a sufficient depth of water to enable a 2 nd class cruiser to communicate at anv time with a telegraph station at Bassidore. As for this British possession on the north-west corner of Kishm Island it is of no practical value for naval purposes, but it is invaluable in givin 0, us a claim, so that no other foreign Power shall in the future obtain a footing on the island. In mentioning the approaches to Bassidore, I have neglected to note the one through Clarence Strait, because it is not likely that we could find time to navigate such a difficult strait for the sake of communicating with a telegraph station in a critical time. 1 4. In the event of a foreign Power making a fortified port in the Persian Gulf, it will probably be necessary to have a fortified coaling station at the entrance to the Gulf, and to seize certain strategic positions so as to command the entrance to the Persian Gulf. The islands of Kishm, Hormuz, Larak, and Hen jam should then be held; the two former cover Bunder Abbas, and their occupation would make the holding of that place by a hostile country an impossibility. 5. Whilst visiting the Maklab Promontory in company with His Excel lency the Viceroy, both Malcolm and Elphinstone Inlets were visited. Both these places are capable of sheltering large fleets, but they are not suitable for our purposes; at the same time they should not be allowed to fall into the hands of any other Power. 6 . Khor Kawi, which was visited on the same occasion, appeared to me a most suitable place for a naval coaling station. It is easy of approach from the south, and not difficult from the north, although at that entrance the tides aie strong. A spur of rock shaped like a pier runs out at rieffit ano&gt;lpo +r» wmuu is umy aoout 51 miles distant. 7. In conclusion, I would surest that tho .... v. —^ a, huluuu irnoe or Arabs.

[Confidential). I.— Maskat. The cove is small for modern vessels, although it has a good depth of water, and when a northerly wind blows it becomes rough inside, even opposite the coaling sheds in Makalla Bay. 2. The Hyacinth, Argonaut, and Fox were anchored off the mouth of the harbour, Fomone just inside, the It. I. M. S. Hardinge inside of her, and Sphinx, Lapwing, and the It. I. M. S. Lawrence inside of the Hardinge. 3. The new vessel belonging to the Sultan of Maskat was there. She is small, more like a yacht than a ship of war, and has not any fighting value, except against dhows. 4. The army and the forts are of no use except against the neighbouring Arabs, and are not worth taking into account* II.— Mtjsa®£»~Promontory. (a) Kubbat Ghazira [Malcolm Inlet). 5. Is a fine large harbour, with a great depth of water. There are two coves on the north-east side, which would serve as anchorages, the better of the two appearing to be the one with the village of Eilam at its head. Erom the westerly cove it is easy to climb the ridge of the Maklab Isthmus, and look down upon Elphinstone Inlet. 6. Malcolm Inlet would shelter a large fleet, hut it is not suitable as a coaling station, as it would not be easy to defend. Vessels could safely coal in it from colliers, and it would serve as a good temporary anchorage. (6) Kubbat Shabus. 7. Is small, but would afford shelter to small craft. I did not go inside it. (c) Hubat Shisa (Combermere Cove). 8. Is a large bay open to the eastward. There is a sheltered anchorage inside Red Islands for one or two vessels, but it is not of any value except as a temporary shelter from north-westerly winds. (d) Fafc-al-Assad Strait. 9 Is quite easy to pass through. The tides are strong and a good speed tould be maintained. It is quite 3 cables across, the rocks drop so perpendi- ilarly that they look like door-posts.2 (e) The Bays on the northern part of the Promontory. 10. Are all exposed to the north, as the chart shews. (/) Khor Kawi. 11. Is a fine sheltered anchorage. It is 3 cables wide at the northern entrance, and about 6 to 7 cables wide most of its length; the depth of water is from 15 to 19 fathoms according to the chart. 12. It is formed by the island of Jezirat al Ghanam (Sheep Island) and the mainland. The island is about 100 feet high at its lowest saddle, and from its northern end a rocky point juts out about 2 cables and looks like a pier. In the angle thus formed is a ledge of rock which appears to have about 3 feet of water on it, and to cover about an acre. This rocky point makes the harbour secure against any swell rolling in from the northward. 13. To the southward of the point is a Bay formed by an indentation in the island. 11. The Khor appears capable of sheltering several large cruisers at single anchor, and more if moored, besides a number of small craft. 15. Owing to the tides, the northern entrance is more difficult than the southern to enter. The latter is land locked, owing to the conformation of the Musandam Promontory, but for a steam*ship both are quite easy of approach. 16. Khor Kawi may, on further examination, turn out to be very suitable for a coaling station; a survey will shortly be undertaken. Its strategical position is excellent, and in conjunction with the Islands of Kishm, Henjam, Larak, and Hormuz, it will form a strong position for the control of the entrance to the Gulf. 17. The danger of ships being taken by surprise can be averted by forming a signal station on the high hill on Sheep Island, from which a long ran»e of vision can be obtained, and warning given in sufficient time of the approach of anv vessel. * 18. The bay at the south-east corner of the southern entrance will also be examined to ascertain its capabilities as a torpedo station. (#) Khor ash Shem (Klphinstone Inlet). 19. Is a magnificent piece of water, 7 miles long. It has anchorages all over it, and many coves. The usual anchorage is near Telegraph Island, which is about the hottest part of it. 20. Surrounded by high mountains and barren rocky hills, no breeze can reach Telegraph Island, or the middle of the Khor, consequently the air must be still and the radiation great. In fact the heat is too great for Europeans to bear, and even the Arab nomads who fish there, move in the hot weather. At 3 p.m. on 20th November (when I visited it) the thermometer stood at 86 0 E. If this is the winter temperature, what must it be in summer ? 21. By landing and climbing the ridge in the Maklab Isthmus, about 200 feet high, one can look down on Malcolm Inlet, and have a fine view of it (except the cove with Filam at its head) and of Elphinstone Inlet. The rid° &lt; e is about equidistant from both inlets. 22 . lo defend Elphinstone Inlet it would be necessary to hold the ridge of the Maklab Isthmus, as well as the entrance, but owing to the heat it could not be occupied from July to October, and therefore as a naval station it is not of much value. III.— Shargah. 23. This place is quite open to the northward, and with a northerly wind a nasty swell rolls into the roadstead. 21. The Jowashmi Sheikh of Shargah resides here and it is the centre of the pearling fishery, but otherwise it is not of any importance The Sheikh is acknowledged as the most important of the Trucial Chiefs. »IV. —Bunder Abbas. 25. This town is situated on the mainland of Persia opposite the town of Kishm in the Island of Kism, from which it is distant about 13 miles. 26. The water is shallow, and ships lie a good 4 miles from the shore, although the Sphinx can go in to about miles from the town. Ten and a quarter miles from it is Hormuz Island, and almost due south, about 18 miles, is Larak Island. 27. Between the town of Kishm and Bunder Abbas and to the westward is a good roadstead at the entrance of the Clarence Strait. This strait would he navigable by large ships, if it were buoyed, as far as Bassidu, which is nearly 65 miles to the westward by this channel. 28. A good anchorage is reported off Laft point, but this is 32 miles from Kishm, and too much out of the way for war purposes. 29. This entrance to the Clarence Strait was, and might be again, the rendezvous of a large expeditionary force operating in Southern Persia. V.— Hen jam Strait. 30. There is a temporary anchorage off Henjam Island in the strait between that Island and Kishm, and at this point a telegraph station formerly existed. It is about to be resumed by the Government of India, and could be used as a war signal station, if required, as it is easy of approach from either the east or west. 31. It is not of any use as a permanent anchorage or depdt. As it is only 31 miles from Khor Kawi it could easily be connected with it by cable when found necessary, should that place become a coaling station. VI.— Bassidu. 32. As a deep water channel was said to exist to the southward of Kishm Island, ! examined it in H. M. S. Sphinx, followed later by the K. I. M. S. Lawrence. 33. A 4 to fathom channel was found, a tracing of which will be sent to the Hydrographer, but it is not easy to find, except in fine weather and by use of the lead. It is not at any time suitable for a second class cruiser, but she might use it with care in clear weather. 34. Bassidu was used in the old days by small craft belonging to the Indian Navy. There is deep and good anchorage off it, but it is a small craft place. On going to Lingah from it in the Sphinx we passed over a long bank with 3J fathoms on it—this being the only passage. 35 The pier is in fairly good order, but most of the old buildings are in ruins A heap of old coal, probably about 5 tons, lies in the open. There is a flagstaff on which the British flag is hoisted, and an old Arab (the British A&lt;?enO receives Rs. 12 a year for doing so (in addition to Rs. 30 as agent, and Rs. 7 for taking mails to and from Lingah). He is a Briton of the British. 36. According to a plan the area of British territory is roughly 600 acres. 37. The Agent confirmed the statement that Singao is British, but that old Bassidu is not. He stated that the Russian Consul at Bunder Abbas visited Bassidu last spring with a Persian official. 38 Some of the Arabs living at Lingah and in other parts of Kishm are verv anxious to settle at Bassidu under the British, and thus escape the heavy Customs dues, but they have not hitherto been encouraged to do so. Tt would nrobably soon absorb the trade from Lingah and the adjacent ports iiTbecame a free port under the protection of the Government of india. granted to the British in 1820 hy the Iman of Maskat, who at that timc hadl lease of the island of Kishm. When the Persiansforcibly resumed the island no challenge to our rights was ever made, and we have thus kept a footing there. VIL— Lingah. 40. This is an important town, owing to it being a trading centre, and the fact that, unlike most Gulf ports, large vessels can lie within a mile or so of the shore. The anchorage is exposed to the south-west, but sheltered from most winds. 41. Several of the domed cisterns mentioned in N. I. D. Report No. 694 were empty when I was at Lingah and others had only a little dirty water in them. They appeared to have a capacity of about 60,000 gallons each. VIII.— Bahrein. 42. I visited this place in the Sphinx. A second class cruiser drawing not more than 22 feet 6 inches could enter Bahrein harbour one hour before high tide, and anchor 5 miles from the town and about 4 miles from Muharrak. 43. Bahrein is not of any value as a base for war purposes. 44. I notice that in the N. I. D. Report No. 694, Bar al Katr is said to be under Turkish control. This is not the case. The British support the independence of the Sheikhs, and have lately objected to a Turkish Mudir being appointed for the district. IX.—Koweit. 45. The importance of the Bay of Koweit has been somewhat over-rated, and that of Khor Abdullah lost sight of until it is too late, the Turks having now established themselves at Umkasr, and on the island of Bubiyan. 46. A large vessel could lie in the anchorage in any weather, but a collier could not lie alongside her in a Shamal. Vessels lie about 2 miles from the shore. 47. During the stay of the squadron many small caravans were observed to enter and leave the town, showing that there is probably a considerable trade overland. 48. ^ I proceeded up the Bay in the Sphinx. A second class cruiser can go up to within 2^ miles of the shore near Jehara, which town is over half a mile inland. It is a fine bay, but the shallowness of the water near the shore detracts from its value. The head of the bay is, however, of course more sheltered than the part of it near Koweit. X.— Khor Abdttleah. 49. Leaving Koweit with my flag in the Sphinx at 10 p.m., followed by the Lawrence, I proceeded to Khor Abdullah, and entered it at daylight on the following day, passing Ras al Geit, the Turkish post on the south-east of Bubiyan Island, where the Turkish flag was flying. This post cannot be approached to within about 3 miles by water, owing to the mud flats off it. We arrived at the bar between Warba Island and the mainland, and found 2 fathoms at low water. Passing over it into deep water we entered the Khor leading to Umkasr, navigation being quite easy, except for the bar. Arriving near Umkasr, which is a Turkish fort with no village, we anchored, and, after looking round, proceeded out of the Khor. 50. Our observation led us to the conclusion that the proposed railway will probably come to a point on the mainland opposite the north-west corner of Bubiyan Island, where there is a sheet of water, with plenty of depth and room for an anchorage. It can also be approached easily at any time of tide. 51. Bubiyan Island and the shore on the mainland opposite are claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit. He has now been formally taken under Britishprotection by the Indian QoTemment, and has been directed to establish two posts, one on the north side of Bubiyan island and the other on the north west corner, and the Turks will he warned by him to leave the island. 52. On proceeding out of the Khor Abdullah I noticed a flat with 4 fathoms on it, at about hours’ flood. The Khor requires a careful survey. XI.— Khor Musa. 53. Having anchored off Khor Musa at 11-30 p.m. in the Sphinx with the Lawrence in company, we proceeded up the Khor at daylight on the following day. When once^ we were sure that we had struck the entrance, navigation was quite easy. This is ascertained by seeing Bu Saif, a low point with a few trees on it, and the islet of A itch Shaham. Trom this the Khor is a splendid sheet of water, ending at anchorage No. 1. where a large fleet could anchor. Here it branches into the inlet leading to No. 2, which we did not enter, and to No. 3 anchorage. We went up to within about miles of No. 3, and anchored in 36 feet, whilst a party landed to test the mud flats. It was thought that at high water springs the flats would be covered. The landing at No. 1 will be a difficulty, no doubt, for the banks appear to be no more than mud flats, which may be covered at high water springs under some circumstances. XII.— The Khors Generally. 54. Until a railway is brought from the interior to either Khor Abdullah or Khor Musa, they are not of value to a country strong on land, so that their development belongs rather to the future than the present. I suppose in time Bussia will connect her railway system with Khor Musa, and Germany will connect her Bagdad Bailway system with Khor Abdullah. It is incumbent on us, therefore, to prepare to hold the entrance to the Gulf, unless we can keep those Powers away from it altogether, which should be our constant aim. XIII.— Conclusion. 55. The Hyacinth and Hardinge having been given a rendezvous 9 miles south-south-east of Khor Musa, His Excellency the Viceroy re-embarked in the Hardinge and I returned to the Hyacinth at 7 p.m., and we pro ceeded to Bushire, where the squadron anchored next morning 5J miles from the shore, and bj miles by water from Bushire town.

We are strongly of opinion that, in the event of the Russians occupying Bunder Abbas or any other Persian harbour near the entrance of the Gulf, or acquiring political or naval privileges there, such as would constitute a violation of the understanding of 1834, .our Naval Officer Commanding in the Gulf should have instructions at once to plant the British flag upon the three islands of Hormuz, Henjam and Kishm. We would occupy Hormuz, not with the idea of making it our principal naval station, but in order to prevent its being taken by Russia, and because its possession would give us command of Bunder Abbas. Heniam and Kishm in our opinion must necessarily be taken together. The smaller island is required because the best available harbour in this part of the Gulf appears to be that which lies between it and Kishm, and Kishm. is necessary to us because we already possess a plot of British territory upon it at Bassidore, and because it would be indispensable as a base of supplies t Vide tlie Viceroy’, telegram of the 18th March for Henjam Your Lordship is aware f 1899 . of the conditions under which we hold nossession of Bassidore. Though we no longer use the place as a coaling depot, we keen an agent there, who flies the British flag, which seems for the present, to be all that is required, as an assertion of our proprietary rights. I here are no independent local chiefs or authorities in the islands with whom we could enter into relations. With the exception of the tract in our possession at Bassidore, the islands are under Fersian authority, and since Lieutenant Hunt s visit, the Kalantar of Kishm, Sheikh Hasan, is said to have been superseded at the instance of the Director-General of Customs in Southern Persia by another offidah ^ harbour of Khor ash shem or Elphinstone’s Inlet upon the western side of the Musandim promontory possesses many advantages, but we consider it less suitable for our ultimate naval station at the mouth of the Gulf because of f A \its distance from thcmain tmcic of^mer^ l^k of supplies, and the u ^ see n0 objection, in the contingency Musandim.

Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in tbe Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential memo randum No. 2345 E.-A., dated 21st December 1900, forwarding, for early report, copy of a Secret despatch, with enclosures, from Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, No. 30, dated 23rd November 1900, on the subject of the islands of Henjam, Kishm and Hormuz. 2. I forward, herewith, a report submitted to me by Lieutenant Hunt, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas, who visited the island of Kishm for the purpose of obtaining information. The island of Kishm, otherwise called Jezirat-al-Tawilah, is the largest island in the Persian Gulf, and is 60 miles in length, its greatest breadth being 19* miles, but averaging only about 7 miles. It lies parallel to the mainland of Persia, from which it is separated by the Clarence Strait which varies in width from t Persian Gulf Pilot. 1 to 7 miles.+ Kishm, the principal town The Gazetteer says 3 to s miles. on t,i ie island, is situated at the eastern most point of the island, nearly opposite Bunder Abbas. It will be seen from a reference to Curzon’s “ Persia,” Vol. II, page 411, that a Cantonment of English and Indian troops, several hundred strong, w T as, in 1820, established on the island in the vicinity of Kishm, with the idea of overawing the Joasmi pirates. Bassidore, at the north-western extremity of the island, has also been occupied as the head-quarters of the Indian Naval Squadron, hut has been, for a long time, abandoned. It has been frequently spoken of as a British possession, but I have been unable to ascertain from the records of this office on wdiat tenure the place was held by us. With reference to this island, it may, I think, be accepted that the climate, from the beginning of May to the end of October, is very trying, wffiile supplies would have to he brought from India, though arrangements for a sufficient water-supply could be made without difficulty. Heniam is a small barren island situated to the south of Kishm, and separated from it by a strait about half-a-mile in width. It is about 5 miles long bv 24 broad. If the reservoirs were repaired, there would probably be sufficient water-supply on the island for a small number of men ^ There is a small Arab population on the island. The island of Hormuz, K miles m circumference, is situated to the north-east of Kishm, being 15 miles distant from that island, and 12 miles south-east of Bunder Abbas. The watei-supp y is scanty, and no supplies would be obtainable. 3 There is, I think, no reasonable doubt that these three island s.^ at t le nresent time form an integral portion of the Persian dominions. The islan s of Kishm and Hormuz, and, presumably, Henjam were, as appanages of Bunde7Abbas rented by the Imams of Maskat from the Shahs of Persia but the ruler of Maskat can now have no claim to any of the islands. Bassidore the ruler ot ivia l lieve in 182 2, perhaps under some arrangement with ^6 ArKeilfh of Bunder Abbas, but our right of occupancy is, I understand, only prescriptive. Report by LunTESm Hunt, Assistant Resident and His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas, on the islands of Kishm, Henjam and Hormuz. L—Kishm. Abb^Ltu is very Seldom thfnKpSy Golnoro™Stt°er Jlacf isstrong enough to make his authority felt in the island, which is under a Kalantar, generally known as the Sheikh, who pays his revenue in the usual way The present Kalantar is Sheikh Hassan, who has held this position for many years, with the exception of one year when another man was appointed He is an Arab, descended from a Nejdi family, whose forefathers migrated from Nejd some two hundred years ago, and, after working up to Basrah,°came down the Gulf until they finally settled on the island of Kishm. Population.—-The population of the island is entirely Arab. The chief town, Kishm, is situated at the extreme east of the island, and is said to contain 1,700 houses and some 6,000 inhabitants. From Kishm to Bassidore at the other end of the island there are 363 villages or hamlets, containing from 10 to 100 houses each; at a very moderate computation, therefore, the island must contain between 35,000 and 40,000 souls. A large proportion of the people leave in the date season to work upon the mainland. Water. —The town of Kishm itself has 7 “ Birkas ” and 3 wells. In good years, the reservoirs usually suffice for the needs of the population, hut in dry years they fail, as do frequently, too, the wells, these latter being very shallow. The inhabitants then bring their water from Dergoon, a village about a farsakli distant, where there are several good wells which do not fail. The whole island of Kishm appears to he fairly off for water, althouoh most of the w r ells are doubtless slightly brackish. They are all, however, very shallow and deep ; boring might possibly strike purer water. Climate .—The inhabitants claim, and their neighbours allow, that in the hot weather the heat in Kishm is not so oppressive as in Bunder Abbas, and that the climate is altogether more healthy. This may be the case, as the island is less shut in, and is more open to the breezes; but in the matter of temperature, I should imagine, the difference can only be slight. Sapp lies. There is a considerable area of cultivation in the shape of wheat, barley, vegetables and date groves, all depending upon the winter rain fan. I am informed that, in average years, the corn and dates produced suffice lor the wants^ of the population, and they are independent, except as regards rice, which is imported from Bombay or Karachi. The date groves are not very productive, as they cannot be properly irrigated. There are a few camels and about 1,000 head of cattle, sheep and goats upon the island. ^ Fodder and pasture is good and plentiful, comparing favour ably with the mainland. The bazar of Kishm tow r n is a clean, good and fairly arge one. It is supplied partly from Bunder Abbas, and partly by direct importation from India. l j j The only textile manufacture of the island is a thin cotton stuff called Me-farrash”, used, as its name implies, to cover ordinary matting m rooms. There are 25 looms engaged in producing this. A few dhows, too, are built every year on the island. During the past few years Kishm has been subject to earthquakes, which have from time to time destroyed nearly half the town. Ihe maliat proper (asl) paid is 3,000 tomans per annum; this, with the cus omary presents, &amp;c. (asl-u-far), amounts to 4,000 tomans, more or less according to the strength of the Deputy Governor of the time at Bunder Abbas. II.— Henjam. Henjam has, for years past, been leased to the Moin-ut-Tujjar, who was, I e icve, ^xpe ed Hom Bushire for intrigue. He has an agent in Bunder k nnrw n an ^ ^ va ^ ua ^ e 011 account of its salt mines, from which some 5,000 to 7,000 tons of salt are exported yearly to Calcutta. The exporters pay a tax lor this salt at the rate of so much a boat-load to the Shaikh of Kishm, who is supposed to make it over to the Moin’s agent. The Sheikh, however, does not observe this ceremony, unless the Moin happens to be influential enough to enforce compliance. Shaikh Hassan provides the labour for the dig ging out of the salt and the boats for lightering.There are three wells and reservoirs on this island ahont two miles away from the mines, and the water is said to he good; hut it is customary for people, who work there, to take their water with them. There is no cultivation. The climate resembles that of Kishm. III.— Hormtjz. ^ This island is like Henjam, Larak and Bostana, leased to the Moin-ut- Tujjar. It apparently contains considerable mineral wealth in the shape of red ochre, salt and copper or iron. The ochre is chiefly worked, and the salt to a lesser extent. The rock salt does not appear to he worked at all. There is only one village, situated in the vicinity of the old Portuguese fort, and containing from 150 to 200 houses. There are six reservoirs and wells, the water of the well being unfit to drink. The climate probably differs in no essential particular from that of Bunder Abbas. There is practically no cultivation. In the date season nearly all the inhabitants go to work at Minab. The island is under the Deputy Governor of Bunder Abbas, and has no Chief or Kalantar. (Sd.) Verb Hunt.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODR.ICK, Sis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Poet William, the 21 st January 1904 . Sir During the recent tour of His Excellency the Viceroy in the Persian 3 u i f in tlie company of the Naval Commander-m-Chief. Rear-Admiral A kmson- Willes, the question of the selection of naval positions in the Gulf, which has oreatly occupied the attention both of His Majesty’s Government aud °f « « Government A of India in recent years, was carefully considered _ by Their Fvcellencies In company they visited and examined all the principal ports, hilKiurs ° or anchorages in those waters, and arrived at conclusions respecting them which the Naval Commander-in-Chief has already reported to the Admiralty in a letter, dated 8th December, copy of which was sent to us and is forwarded herewith. The enclosures to this despatch also contain a corre- spondence S passed between the Government of India and the Adnnral on the same subject, while the squadron was still m the lersian Gulf. ^ 2. 'From this correspondence it will he seen that the subjects under examination fell under three heads - (i) The selection of suitable naval bases or coaling stations at the entrance to the Gulf. (ii) The choice of a telegraph station either at Henjam or Bassidore (Basiduh). /un The features and potentialities of the various khors or maritime inlets at the upper end of the Gulf, to which it seems likely that trans-Turkish or trans-Persian Endways may be taken at some future date. 3 We propose to address you in the present despatch on the first two f i, ' ™iiiects We will reserve the third for a further communication, only Int^nin- on the prlsent occasion that, in paragraph 51 of his letter to Se Admiralty Rear-Admiral Atkinson-Willes hig been under a mis- the -A din y, nature of establishing a protectorate over th^Sheikh of Koweit have been taken by the Government of India, and no directions of the character named have been ^sned to him. 1 he subject is K1S d S£ S KoiSS of InA steps whicli hare not teen taken.4 The question of the position to he assumed by Great Britain at the entrance to the Persian Gulf either in the event of hostilities with a forei-n Power or—which is perhaps even more important—with a view to preventing the acquisition of coaling stations or harbours by such Powers m time of peace, resolves itself into a decision as to the best stations to he occupied on the northern and southern sides of the entrance. Stations outside the Gulf, or inside it at any distance from the mouth, will not enable a fleet to operate with nearly so much rapidity or advantage: while the configuration of the entrance, the two sides of which are in sight of each other, is such as to give to a naval Power suitably established on either coast, a command of the interior waters so absolute as to enable it to dispense with stations further up the Gulf, and to exercise a commanding control over the movements of a Power possessing any such bases. Por this purpose the anchorage at the eastern end of Kishm Island, which is formed by the islands of Kishm, Larak, and Hormuz, being enclosed between them and the mainland, on which stands the port of Bunder Abbas, appears to afford an almost ideal position on the northern side x The anchorage extends far up the channel between Hishm and the mainland, which is known as Clarence Straits. It is well screened^ from the sea; it would accommodate the largest fleet; it commands an important Persian trading port and trade route; and there has been for a long time past a consensus of expert naval opinion that this is the first position that should be occupied by Great Britain, together with the adjoining islands, in the event of such action being required, i The anchorage in question is not one where a coaling station would probably be established, or which ^ would call for defence. But as a place of rendezvous for a fleet that desired to com mand the entry to the Gulf, and to prevent the acquisition of Bunder Abbas or the neighbouring islands by a foreign Power, it would appear to be admirably adapted for the purpose. 5. The investigation conducted by the Viceroy and the Admiral on the oppo site shores of the mouth of the Gulf, where they explored the various harbours, inlets, and fiords of the curiously indented promontory commonly known as Cape Musandim, led to equally clear conclusions. It will be seen from the report of the Naval Commander-in-Chief that he advocates establishing a lien as a coaling station upon the anchorage of Khor Kawi on the western side of the peninsula, presuming that further surveys, which he ordered, but the results of which we have not yet learned, confirm its desirability as an anchorage. .At the same time it would be necessary to take steps to prevent the occupation, by foreign Powers of the fine harbours of Kubbat Ghazira (Malcolm Inlet) and Khor-ash-Shem (Elphinstone Inlet), which pierce the peninsula at its narrowest point, and are only prevented from mingling their waters by a narrow isthmus or tongue of land a few hundred yards in width. These harbours are not required by us, because there are superior positions elsewhere, and because of their torrid and insupportable climate in the summer. At the same time it is undesirable that any foreign flag should be planted in either of them, or that any question, save of British ownership, should arise. Portunately this question is one that admits of easy solution. Elphinstone Inlet has already once been in British occupation. The plinth of the former Telegraph Station on a small island in the interior of the Khor is still standing: and the cable itself was taken in former days from Malcolm Inlet across the narrow isthmus that we have described. In Lord George- Hamilton’s despatch No. 4 (Secret), dated 27th Eebruary 1903, we received permission to re-occupy the old Telegraph Station at a suitable opportunity. It seems to us that the best way of effecting this re-occupation and of preventing the contingency of foreign rivalry would be to erect a flagstaff on the isthmus that commands the two harbours, and also on Telegraph Island. The posts will be put up unobtrusively, and the action is likely not only not to attract attention, but in all probability to remain undiscovered for a long time, so rarely are these waters visited by any but British vessels and so infrequently even by these. We believe that we should have no difficulty in arranging with the local tribes—who consist only of a few miserable communities of fishermen, occupy ing tiny villages in the inner recesses of the coves, and acknowledging no Chief or master—to take care of the flagstaffs, and occasionally, or when required, to hoist a flag upon them. We would propose, as recommended by the Admiralin his letter to us, to take similar action in planting a flagstaff on Sheep Island, which constitutes the outer protection of Khor Kawi. 6. In their tour of the Musandim Promontory, the Viceroy and the Naval Commander-in-Chief further considered the desirability of placing a light-house on some suitable site at the extremity of the peninsula, both in the interests of navigation, which is compelled to avoid the neighbouring channels exo ®Pt bv daylight, and in order still farther to emphasise our hold over t e Musandim harbours and islands. This light might he placed either on e rocky point of Cape Musandim or on one of the three islands, called the Quoins, that are situated at a little distance^ from it in the open sea. We believe that, for nautical purposes, the latter might he slightly the^ superior position: hut the political advantages of placing the light upon a point of the Musandim Peninsula are deserving of serious consideration, and will probably incline us to select this locality. The matter is one upon which we are about to consult the authorities interested, and we will address you again upon it. In the event of a light-house being built, we think that the cost might properly he charged to Indian revenues. 7 We now pass to a diseussion o£ the second question to which we have referred, viz., that of the re-opening of a British telegraph station at Henjam or Bassidore. We need not recapitulate the arguments which we have employed on a previous occasion, in favour of such a measure; for they have already obtained the approval of His Majesty’s Government. The only question at issue is the choice between the two sites ; and it was this question that H Excellency the Viceroy and the Admiral charged themselves more particulai y with the endeavour to decide. ' 8. The arguments in favour of Henjam appeared to them to be so conclusive, and are so clearly stated in the Admiral’s two letters that it is un necessary to recapitulate them here. The earlier discussions on the matter, particularly by the naval authorities, appear to have rested on some misappr - Csbn of the object which it is sought to secure, We did not propose the re-institution of our former cable station at Hen 3 am m order to create a naval port or station there (for, as we have shown, there are superior positions nearer . to the mouth of the Gulf), but in order to provide for our ships a place of , telegraphic call and signal station at no great distance from the entrance, and to strengthen our hold upon the island of Kishm, where we already possess a | British settlement at the western extremity, and to which the smalier islan of Henjam physically belongs. For these purposes there ean be no doubt that Heniam is a greatly superior locality to Bassidore. It possess _ 1 , f advanta“es that, while Bassidore is rather out of the way and difficult of access except to small vessels, ships of any size can anchor tempoiarily Heniam Moreover, it would bo easy to connect the latter by cable with Kbo lawfS'a time of Emergency, should the Khor ever be utilised as a coaling station. ^ ^ of the meth od b y which if ^ Majesty’s Government approve of the sugge^ions '^^^SThe Persian rnTnmSt 'and solicit theif^e mtit to re-establish Lr former Telegraph Sn A. Jdaram^ , , r • there, with the materials and the necessaiy 1 vuv British Telegraph Station stood from 1869 to 1881 is still m a guuu which the Butisn xeiegiap northern shore of the island, S nt tt'Gencht'whil^he cahie L laid to the sea is clearly visible. The Malik-ut-Tajar, who held a lease of the Kishm salt-mines, erected a flag-poleon this foundation some 12 years ago; but it does not appear that a flag was ever hoisted upon it, nor are there any representatives of the Persian Govern ment now upon the island. In fact, so far as the Viceroy was able to ascertain, connections are maintained by the inhabitants with the opposite or Arab Coast of the Gulf that might almost entitle Henjam to be described as a derelict, upon which no trace of Persian sovereignty is now in existence. 10. On 21st September 1903, Sir A. Hardinge addressed a telegram to the Poreign Office in which he said that his original proposal which we have just described must, he thought, be modified because of his inability to trace among the records in the Tehran Legation the original Persian of the Shah’s authorisation of 1868, a copy of which was forwarded to your piedecessor with our Secret despatch No. 56 (External) of 7th May 1903. We do not appreciate the force of this argument. The absence or the loss of the Persian original cannot possibly alter the facts that the concession was granted; that it was acted upon for 12 years; and that incontestable traces of occupation still survive on the spot. It appears to us, therefore, to be open to His Majesty’s Government to adopt whichever method of procedure they may prefer. 11. The choice may be expected in part to turn upon the present attitude of the Persian Government and the policy that it is desired to pursue towards them. The experience of His Excellency the Viceroy during his recent visit to Bushire, the subsequent behaviour of the Persian Government with regard to that incident, and the general tone of unfriendliness that has characterised their recent communications, undoubtedly justify the adoption of a firm attitude, and will probably not have predisposed His Majesty’s Govern ment to any unnecessary display of courtesy. In these circumstances, it may be thought desirable to act upon Sir A. Hardinge’s advice, and to restore the telegraph station without more ado. We should be grateful for early instructions on the subject, in order that the cable may be laid and the necessary buildings re-erected during the present cool season. Failing the adoption of this plan, w T e think that the second alternative would be pre ferable to the first, although it is to be feared, as anticipated by Sir A. Hardinge in his letter to the Marquess of Lansdowne of 27th June 1903. that any procedure that might open the door for discussion or protest, could not fail to be attended by considerable delay. 12 . In either case the Persian Government might be conciliated by the proposal to carry on the telegraph wire either by land or by sea from Heniam to Bunder Abbas. When the Viceroy was at the latter place, he was earnestly pressed both by the local traders and also by the Salar-i-Moazzam, Governor of the Gulf Ports, to lend bis assistance to the connection of Bunder Abbas by telegraph with the outer world; and it is scarcely credible that the Persian Government, unless they mean to be deliberately unpleasant, should not welcome an extension which will be both of political and of commercial advantage to them. Should they do so, they might opportunely be reminded that, under the Convention of 2nd April 1868, we possess the right to continue our land line from Jask to some point between that place and Bunder Abbas, a phrase which might be interpreted as applicable to any spot short of Bunder Abbas itself, such as the British Consulate at Naband, four miles on the Jask side of the towm. .13* fhe event of His Majesty’s Government accepting our proposals for the immediate re-institution of a cable station at Henjam, w r e trust that they will, upon reconsideration, consent to bear at least one half of the cost of the arrano’e- a ,iguested in Our Secret despatch No. 56 (External), dated the 7thMay iyU3. Ike telegraph is asked for in the main in the interests of the naval squadron which is maintained in the Persian Gulf by His Majesty’s Govern ment : and also on political grounds, which are divided in even proportions between the Imperial Government and the Government of India. The larger part of the expenditure on the shores of the Gulf is already borne by Indfan revenues : and it does not seem fair that any fresh measures that may be required to sustain our influence on the sea—the charge of which has hitherto been assumed by the Home Government (with substantial contributions Horn our selves) should be debited exclusively to Indian funds.14. We have now detailed at some length the proposals which we recom mend for the protection of our paramount naval, strategical, and political ^Interests in the Persian Gulf. It seems to us most desirable that the oppor tunity of acting while action is still easy, and before we can he forestalled, should not he sacrificed : and we trust to receive early permission (in the case of Henjam, which has already been accepted in principle, if possible by tele graph) to proceed in the manner described. We have the honour to he, Sir, Tour most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) CUKZON. „ KITCHENER. „ T. RALEIGH. „ E. E.-G. LAW. „ E. R. ELLES. „ A. T. ARUNDEL.

From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—His Excellency Rear-Admiral G. Atkinson-Willes, Naval Commander-in- Chief, East Indian Station. I am desired to refer to your letters No. 872, dated 6th September 1903, and No. 872 (sic), dated 16th October 1903, on the subject of the recent surveys of possible ports on the Persian Coast of the Gulf and of an additional cable station in those waters. 2. As you are aware the desirability of establishing such a cable station for naval purposes has been accepted by all parties; and the sole question that remains for decision appears to be whether it should he located as originally proposed by the Government of India at Henjam, where we had such a station from 1869 to 1881, or at Bassidore, which is a British possession and was considered to he more suitable by the Admiralty. It would appear from the correspondence that has been forwarded to us, that the question has been regarded by the Naval officers in the Gulf whose reports we have seen, and also by the Admiralty at home, in relation to the selection of a defended naval port in the Gulf, rather than of a station for purposes of telegraphic commu nication These considerations may coincide; hut, on the other hand, they may he widely different. The place that is most suitable for a naval anchorage and establishment may be unsuitable for a cable station, and vice versd. It is, however the latter and not the former contingency that is mainly involved m the present case : and it is with this object in view that I am directed especially to solicit your advice. 3. At the same time the question of naval bases, ports of call, or coaling stations in the Gulf is one of supreme importance to British interests; and I am also to enquire whether you have any observations or recommendations to make upon this subject to the Government of India as the result of your present cruise in the Gulf. . ^ ^ No. 1295, dated “ Hyacinth” at Bushire, the 3rd December 1903 (Confidential).
