Stalinism Sir, I transmit to you herewith a copy of a memorandum entitled houndations of Stalinism ” which has been prepared in the belief that an examination of the principles laid down in “ Problems of Leninism ” and the “ Short History of the Communist Party ” will reveal the mainsprings of the Soviet approach to international affairs at the present time. The memorandum attempts to set out briefly and systematically the principal doctrines bearing on Soviet foreign policy and is accordingly of value to all who seek to understand the Soviet attitude to world problems to-day, and who have not had the opportunity to study the books themselves. The memorandum should be read by all members of your staff. 2. The enclosed memorandum will also be of use in carrying out the new publicity policy which was the subject of my telegram No. 6. circular, of 23rd January last, though it was not prepared for this purpose and will be followed later by more directly suitable material. It is not a confidential document, but it is not parti cularly suited for distribution in its present form. It should, however, prove useful as a source of authoritative Soviet pronounce ments. In this connexion 1 would draw your attention in particular to the following passages:— Paragraph 6 and Note 25, where it is shown that Social Democracy, and in particular its “ left wing,” is singled out as the principal enemy of Communism which must wage relentless war against it. Paragraph 16 and Notes 37 and 41, where it is shown that . according to Communist doctrine the Soviet Union will not be safe until Communism has been established in other countries. Paragraph 17 and Notes 39 and 55, which show how in Soviet foreign policy the observance of moral principles, such as the right of small nations to self-determination, is entirely sub ordinated to the pursuit of what are conceived to be the real Soviet interests. His Majesty’s Representative at 14620 35001—38Paragraphs 19-21 and Notes 40, 43 and 45, which reveal that revolution should only be embarked on when success is virtually certain and should then be carried through with the utmost determination. Note 50, which makes it clear that the dictatorship of the proletariat to be set up as a result of successful revolution would resemble all other dictatorships in being essentially an instrument in the hands of the ruling class for the suppression of its enemies. 3. Extra copies of this despatch are enclosed for distribution to Consular Officers under your superintendence within the metropolitan territory of the country in which you reside. Copies have been addressed direct to Consular Officers outside your metropolitan territory. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ERNEST BEVIN.2 The basic teachings of Stalin are con tained in his book Problems of Leninism and in the Short History of the Communist Party. The latter was published in 1938. Of the former, the first edition appeared in 1924, and the latest (11th) Russian edition in 1940. The latest English edition was issued as recently as October 1945, and it is still officially sold by the Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House. Each successive edition has been brought up to date in accordance with Stalin’s own instructions, and at any given moment the latest edition has contained those of Stalin’s writings which are of particular relevance to the policy of the Communist Party of the U.S.S.R. Both these works are obligatory reading for members of the Communist Party of the U.S.S.R. Together they form the corpus of the fundamental teachings from which the whole of Communist and Soviet behaviour draws its inspiration. They reveal, there fore, the mainsprings of the Soviet approach to international affairs at the present time and thus stand in the same relation to Soviet foreign policy as Mein Kamyf did to Nazi policy. These works are accessible to the British reading public in English versions, but copies are sometimes in short supply, and they are diffuse and difficult books to read. The following memorandum attempts to set out briefly and systematically the principal doctrines bearing on foreign policy which Stalin expounds in them, and to show their connexion with Soviet thinking to-day. For convenience, the quotations from Stalin’s two books which illustrate the theme of this memorandum are for the most part contained in the note&amp;. Ideology and Political Strategy 2. Stalin’s teachings on the theory of communism are ultimately derived from the materialistic philosophy of Marx and Engels and their dialectical analysis of history as interpreted and handed down to him in apostolic succession by Lenin. Stalin regards the fundamental tenets of Marxism-Leninism, i.e., its guiding princi ples in the fields of method, philosophy and the interpretation of history, as un assailable. But, following Lenin, Stalin does not claim the sanctity of dogma for the political teachings based on the application of these guiding principles to real life. These teachings are a means of effecting3 political change [Note 1], a guide to action [Note 2] and an integral theory of revolu tion [Note 3]; but they are not an immu table doctrine. They must be modified from time to time to bring them into line with changing circumstances [Note 4]. 3. Although the party’s basic teachings about the theory of communism are subject to periodical revision, its political strategy remains steady throughout each successive period of the revolution [Note 5]. In any major period, tactics may change, but the basic strategy will remain unaltered [Note 6]. -(Continued over page) NOTES (Unless otherwise stated, quotations are taken from Problems of Leninism, English translation of 11th Edition, published in Moscow by the Foreign Languages Publishing House, 2nd October, 1945 : and the Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), English trans lation, published in Moscow by the Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1943.) 1. “ Marx said that the materialist theory could not confine itself to explaining the world, that it must also change it.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 28.) 2. “ . . . . the attempt of practical workers to brush theory aside runs counter to the whole spirit of Leninism and is fraught with serious dangers to the cause .... Of course, theory becomes aimless, if it is not connected with revolutionary practice, just as practice gropes in the dark if its path is not illumined by revolutionary theory. But theory can become a tremendous force in the working- class movement if it is built up in indissoluble con nexion with revolutionary practice; for it, and it alone, can give the movement confidence, the power of orientation, and an understanding of the inherent connexion between surrounding events; for it, and it alone, can help practice to discern not only how and in which direction classes are moving at the present time, but also how and in which direction they will move in the near future.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 26.) “ The Marxist-Leninist theory is not a dogma but a guide to action.” (Short History, p. 356.) 3. “ Instead of an integral revolutionary theory there were contradictory theoretical postulates and fragments of theory, which were divorced fron* the actual revolutionary struggle of the masses and had degenerated into threadbare dogmas. For the sake of appearances, Marx’s theory was mentioned, of course, but only to rob it of its living, revolutionary spirit.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 20—in criticism of Social Democracy.) 4. “Lenin said that ‘revolutionary theory is not a dogma,’ that it ‘ undergoes final formulation only when brought into close contact with the practice of the really mass and really revolutionary move ment ’ (‘ Left-wing ’ Communism, an Infantile Disorder); for theory must serve practice, for ‘ theory must answer the questions raised by practice ’ (What the ‘ Friends of the People ’ are), for it must be tested by the data of practice.”' (Problems of Leninism, pp. 23-24.) “ The Marxist-Leninist theory is the science of the development of society, the science of the working-class movement, the science of the pro letarian revolution, the science of the building of the Communist society. And as a science it does not and cannot stand still, but develops and perfects itself. Clearly, in its development it is bound to- become enriched by new experience and new know ledge, and some of its propositions and conclusions are bound to change in the course of time, are bound to be replaced by new conclusions and propositions corresponding to the new historical conditions. (Short History, p. 355.) 5. “ Strategy deals with the main forces of the revolution and their reserves. It changes with the passing of the revolution from one stage to another, but remains essentially unchanged throughout a given stage.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 70.) 6. “ . . . . during the second and third stages of the revolution, tactics changed dozens of times, whereas the strategical plans remained unchanged. B 2 110-404 Basic Political Strategy since 1917 4. Since 1917 the revolution has been in its “ third stage ” [Note 7]. In 1924 Stalin gave the following definition of this period and of the strategy to be used during it: ‘ £ Third stage : Commenced after the October revolution. Objective : to consolidate the dictatorship of the pro letariat in one country, using it as a base for the overthrow of imperialism in all countries. The revolution is spreading beyond the confines of one country; the epoch of world revolution has commenced. The main forces of the revolution : the dictatorship of the proletariat in one country, the revolutionary movement of the proletariat in all countries. Main reserves : the semi-proletarian and small- peasant masses in the developed countries, the liberation movement in the colonies and dependent countries. Direction of the main blow : isolation of the petty bourgeois democrats, isolation of the parties of the Second International, which constitute the main support of the policy of compromise with imperialism. Plan for the disposition of forces : alliance of the proletarian revo lution with the liberation movement in the colonies and dependent countries ” (Prob lems of Leninism, p. 69-70). This defini tion has been included in each successive edition of Problems of Leninism, and in his Letter to Comrade Ivanov, published in Pravda on 12th February, 1938, Stalin emphatically repudiated the suggestion that his teachings in the Problems of Leninism were out of date ('Note 8]. His letter made it clear that these teachings would retain their validity so long as the U.S.S.Ii. was surrounded by bourgeois States. Tactical Deviations from Basic Political Strategy 5. Stalin’s basic strategy as defined above is both aggressive and revolutionary; but owing to the weakness of the Soviet Union and of the Communist parties in other countries he has rarely been able to put his basic teachings on foreign affairs into practice. Since his accession to power, the Soviet Union’s need for peace has demanded the postponement of the party’s more ambitious designs for the spreading of the revolution to other countries [Note 9], though Stalin has never denied that he con sidered the extension of the revolution to “ a number of other countries ” to be desirable [see Note 341. Up to 1933, the Soviet NOTES “ Tactics deal with the forms of struggle and the forms of organisation of the proletariat, with their changes and combinations. During a given stage of the revolution tactics may change several times, depending on the flow or ebb, the rise or decline, of the revolution.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 71.) 7. ‘‘ Our revolution has already passed through two stages, and after the October revolution it has entered a third stage. Our strategy changed accordingly.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 69.) ” .... if the revolution in Europe has begun to ebb, does not this mean that Lenin’s thesis of a new epoch, the epoch of world revolution, has lost its force? Does this not mean that the proletarian revolution in the West has been cancelled? ” It does not. “ The epoch of the world revolution represents a new stage in the revolution; it covers a whole strategic period which may occupy years, or perhaps decades. In the course of this period there will occur, nay, must occur, ebbs and flows in the revo lutionary tide . . . .” (Stalin’s Eeport to the Fourteenth Conference of the Communist Party, 9th May, 1925.) 8. ” As we are not living in an island but in a ‘ system of States,’ of wdiich an important part is behaving in a hostile manner towards socialism and constitutes a danger of intervention and restoration, we say openly and frankly that the victory of socialism in our country is not yet assured. It follows from the foregoing that the second problem (i.e., the problem of foreign relations) is not yet solved and still remains to be solved. Moreover, the second problem cannot be solved in the way we solved the first (i.e., class relations inside the U.S.S.R.), that is, by the efforts of our country alone. This second problem can only be solved by the conjunction of serious efforts on the part of the international proletariat and the still more serious efforts of the whole Soviet people .... Now you can judge if the passage in question from the Problems of Leninism about the victory of socialism in one country is out of date. I wish myself that it were out of date, I wish there were no such things in the world as annoying as the capitalist environ ment, the danger of armed attack, the danger of a restoration of capitalism, &amp;c But unfor tunately all these annoying things continue to exist.” (Pravda, 14th February, 1988.) 9. ” Some think that Leninism is opposed to reforms, opposed to compromises and to agreements in general. This is absolutely wrong. Bolsheviks know as well as anybody else that in a certain sense * every little helps,’ that under certain conditions reforms in general, and compromises and agree ments in particular, are necessary and useful.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 78.) Under certain conditions, in a certain situation, the proletarian Power may find itself constrained temporarily to leave the path of the revolutionary reconstruction of the existing order of things and to take the path of its gradual transformation, .... the path of flanking movements, of reforms and con cessions to the non-proletarian classes—in order to disintegrate these classes, to give the revolution a respite, to recuperate and prepare the conditions for a new offensive.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 79.) “To carry on a war for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie, a war which is a hundred times more difficult, prolonged and complicated than the most stubborn of ordinary wars between States, and to refuse beforehand to manoeuvre, to utilise the conflict of interests (even though temporarily) among one’s enemies, to refuse to temporise and to compromise with possible, (even though transient, unstable, vacillating and conditional) allies—is not this ridiculous in the extreme? Is it not as though, in the difficult ascent of an unexplored and hereto fore inaccessible mountain, we were to renounce5 (3 » 4 * * I • 9 * NOTES Government was anxious to secure a period of quiet for recovery, rehabilitation and the establishment of commercial relations with the outside w^orld [Note 10J. This explains the conciliatory tone of many of Stalin’s public pronouncements after Lenin's death. In this period the Soviet Government disavowed the international threat of communism, though the Com munist Party of the Soviet Union, in its analyses of the international situation, always foreshadowed the ultimate weaken ing of the capitalist system [Note 11 j and the possibility of a new revolutionary upsurge, and with this end in view kept the Comintern alive. From 1933 onwards the non-Soviet world was divided against itself as a result of the aggressive policies of the Axis Powers, and Stalin was able to a cer tain extent to play oh one camp against the other. His Foreign Minister courted the V League Powers, who would presumably be the allies of Russia in the event of a German-Soviet war; yet the Soviet Govern ment was at pains to insist on its readiness to maintain good political and economic relations with the Axis countries. In this period, therefore, Communist strategy was subordinated to diplomatic expediency [Note 12]. (f'ontinued over page) beforehand the idea that at times we might have to go in zig-zags, sometimes retracing our steps, sometimes giving up the course once selected and trying various others? ” (Lenin quoted by Stalin, Problems of Leninism, p. 78.) 10. “I think that the existence of two opposite systems, the capitalist system and the Socialist system, does not exclude the possibility of ... . agreements. I think that such agreements are possible and expedient in conditions of peaceful development. Exports and imports are the most suitable ground for such agreements. We require equipment, raw material (raw cotton for example), semi-manufactures (metals, &amp;c.), while the capital ists require a market for their goods. This pro vides a basis for agreement. The capitalists require oil, timber, grain products, and we require a market for these goods. Here is another basis for agree ment. We require credits, the capitalists require good interest for their credits. Here is still another basis for agreements in the field of credit. It is well known that the Soviet organs are most punctual in their payments. “ The same thing may be said in regard to the diplomatic field. We are pursuing a policy of peace and we are prepared to sign a pact of non-aggression with bourgeois States. We are pursuing a policy of peace .... including complete abolition of stand ing armies, which we declared to the whole world as far back as the time of the Genoa Conference. Here is a basis for agreement in the diplomatic field. The limits to these agreements? The limits are set by the opposite characters of the two systems .between which there is rivalry and conflict. Within the limits permitted by these two systems, but only within these limits, agreement is quite possible. This is proved by the experience of the agreements concluded with Germany, Italy, Japan, &amp;c. “ Are these agreements merely experiments? Or can they be of a more or less prolonged character? That does not altogether depend upon us alone. It depends also upon the other parties. It depends upon the general situation. A war may upset any and every agreement .... We would like these agreements to have a more or less solid character. But that depends, of course, not only upon us, but upon the other parties.” (Stalin’s ” Interview with the First American Labour Delegation in Russia,” 9th September, 1927, quoted in Problems of Leninism, 10th Russian edition, p. 187.) ” .... in order to begin (at least begin) insti tuting a correct world economy, the victory of the proletariat in at least a few advanced countries is necessary. So long as this has not been achieved, our party must seek circuitous paths of co-operating with capitalist groups in the economic arena.” (Stalin’s article, ” The Party After the Seizure of Power (Pravda, 6th—7th November, 1921).) 11. “ Are we in a period of decline of the revo lutionary movement, a period merely of gathering forces, or are we in a period when the conditions are maturing for a new revolutionary upsurge, a period of preparation of the working class for impending class battles? It is on this line that the tactical line of the Communist Parties depends. The amendment of the delegation of the C.P.S.U. (B), which was subsequently adopted by the congress, was a good one for the very reason that it clearly indicated the line based on the latter prospect, the prospect of maturing conditions for a new revolu tionary upsurge.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 245.) 12. “ Our orientation in the past and our orienta tion at the present time is towards the U.S.S.R., and towards the U.S.S.R. alone. (Loud applause.] And if the interests of the U.S.S.R. demand rapproche ment with one country or another which is not interested in disturbing peace, we take this step without hesitation ....6 From 1939 to June 1941 Com munist policy throughout the world reflected Stalin’s anxiety to placate the Germans. But where a choice had to be made between placating the Germans and securing strategic advantages for the U.S.S.R., the decision was in favour of the latter alternative, and Stalin’s basic strategy was manifested in the role played by the Kuusinen Government in the winter war against Finland, and in the use made of the Communist parties of the Baltic States and the other territories annexed by the U.S.S.R. in Eastern Europe. From June 1941 to the victory over Japan, the Communists of all countries subordinated their local interests to the major aim of helping the Soviet Union to win the war. But throughout the whole of the long period of relative inactivity which fol lowed the Revolution, Stalin’s basic ideas remained in reserve for use when con ditions became more favourable [Note 13]. During the second world war the relations between the Soviet Union and its allies continued to be marred by the same reser vations, the same suspicion and the same latent hostility which have always charac terised the Soviet attitude towards the non- Soviet world, and after the end of the war, when the Allies drifted apart and their relations began once more to approximate to the ideal picture of two opposing camps which Lenin and Stalin had drawn in the early years of the revolution, the old strategy began to reappear. The resem blance of current reality to the original ideological scheme has grown steadily closer since 1945, and has been underlined by the post-war drive for ideological orthodoxy. Stalin’s Version of the “ Two Worlds ” Theory 6. Since the October Revolution Stalin has regarded the world as divided into two hostile camps, the camp of socialism and the camp of capitalism [Note 14], The capitalist camp may at times be divided against itself, but all its members are fundamentally hostile to the U.S.S.R. Stalin asserts on general philosophical grounds [Note 15] that the two opposing camps will struggle against each other [Note 16]. In this struggle, the Soviet camp, as representing the young, rising and progressive forces of society, will NOTES “ Our ioreign policy is clear. It is a policy of preserving peace and strengthening commercial relations with all countries. The U.S.S.R. does not think of threatening anybody—let alone of attacking anybody. We stand for peace and champion the cause of peace. But we are not afraid of threats and are prepared to answer the instigators of war blow for blow.” (Problems of Leninism, pp. 467 and 469.) 13. ” The object of this strategy is to gain time, to demoralise the enemy, and to accumulate forces in order later to assume the offensive. ” The signing of the Brest-Litovsk Peace may be taken as a model of this strategy, for it enabled the party to gain time, to take advantage of the conflicts in the camp of the imperialists, to demoralise the forces of the enemy, to retain the support of the peasantry, and to accumulate forces in preparation for the offensive against Kolchak and Denikin .... “ It cannot be denied that in a sense this is a reformist path. But it must be borne in mind that there is a fundamental distinction here, which con sists in the fact that in this case the reform emanates from the proletarian Power, it strengthens the proletarian Power, it procures for it a necessary respite; its purpose is to disintegrate, not the revo lution, but the non-proletarian classes. ” Under such conditions a reform is thus trans formed into its opposite.” (Problems of Leninism, pp. 74 and 79.) 14. “ At the one pole we find capitalism stabilising itself, consolidating the position it has reached and continuing its development. At the other pole we find the Soviet system stabilising itself, consoli dating the positions it has won and marching forward on the road to victory. “ Who will defeat whom? This is the essence of the question.” (Stalin’s Report to the 14th Con ference of the Communist Party, 9th May, 1925.) 15. ” The fight between the old and the new, between the dying and developing, is the very basis of our existence.” (Report to 15th Partv Congress, 1927.) 16. “ Uneven economic and political develop ment,” says Lenin, “is an absolute law of capitalism. Hence, the victory of socialism is possible first in several or even in one capitalist country, taken singly. The victorious proletariat of that country, having expropriated the capitalists and organised its own Socialist production, would stand up against the rest of the world, the capitalist wnrld, attracting to its cause the oppressed classes of other countries, raising revolts in those countries against the capitalists, and in the event of necessity coming out even with armed force against the exploiting classes and their States.” For “ the free union of nations in socialism is impossible without a more or less prolonged and stubborn struggle by the Socialist republics against the baclcward States.” (Lenin, Selected Works, vol. V, p. 141.) (Problems of Leninism, p. 103.) “ The dialectical method therefore holds that the process of development from the lower to the higher takes place not as a harmonious unfolding of phenomena, but as a disclosure of the contradic tions inherent in things and phenomena, as a ‘ struggle ’ of opposite tendencies which operate on' the basis of these contradictions . . . .” “Development is the ‘struggle’ of opposites.” (Lenin, Selected Works, Eng. ed., vol. XI, pp. 81-82.) (Short History, p. 109.) “It is impossible to imagine that the working class of one or more countries could advance to socialism or still more to communism while the capitalists of other countries looked on indifferently and sat with folded hands. Still less can it be imagined that the working class in the capitalist countries wnll agree to be a simple spectator of the victorious development of socialism in this or that7 eventually prevail [Note 17], But this victory will not come of its own accord; it will have to be won by force [Note 18]. A peaceful victory over capitalism is not to be expected [Note 19]. In present cir cumstances, capitalism can only be over thrown by means of revolution [Note 20]. (Continued over page) NOTES country. In reality the capitalists will do everything in their power to strangle such a country. In reality every serious step towards socialism and still more towards communism in this or that country will inevitably be accompanied by an irresistible effort on the part of the working class of the capitalist countries to establish dictatorship and socialism in their countries. Thus in the course of the further development of the international revolution two world centres will develop: the Socialist centre, attracting to itself all the countries gravitating towards socialism, and the capitalist centre, attract ing to itself the countries gravitating towards capitalism. The struggle of these two centres for mastery of the economy of the world will decide the fate of capitalism and communism throughout the world. For the final defeat of world capitalism means the victory of socialism in the arena of world economy.” (Problems of Leninism, 10th Itussian edition, p. 194.) 17. ” Further, if the world is in a state of constant movement and development, if the dying away of the old and the upgrowth of the new is a law r of development, then it is clear that there can be no ‘ immutable ’ social systems, no ‘ eternal principles ’ of private property and exploitation, no ‘ external ideas ’ of the subjugation of the peasant to the land lord, or the worker to the capitalist. “ Hence the capitalist system can be replaced by the Socialist system, just as at one time the feudal system was replaced by the capitalist system. “ Hence we must not base our orientation on the strata of society which are no longer developing, even though they at present constitute the pre« dominant force, but on those strata which are developing and have a future before them, even though they at present do not constitute the pre dominant force.” (Short History, p. 110.) 18. ‘ ‘ The classes which are doomed to disappear from the stage of history are the last to see that their role has ended. To persuade them of this is impossible Therefore the doomed classes take up arms and begin to defend with everything at their disposal their existence as a ruling class. .... The rich experience of history teaches that as yet not a single class has voluntarily given way to another class. There is no such precedent in the whole of world history. And the Communists have learnt this lesson of history. The Communists would welcome the voluntary departure of the bourgeoisie. But such an outcome is unlikely, as experience teaches. Therefore the Communists wish to be prepared for the worst, and call upon the working class to be vigilant and to be prepared to fight .... You are wrong if you think that the Communists are enamoured of violence. They would gladly renounce the method of violence if the ruling classes were prepared to give way to the working class. But the experience of history speaks against any such hypothesis.” (Conversation with H. G. Wells, 1934, Problems of Leninism, 10th Russian edition, p. 608 et seq.) 19. ” Of course, in the remote future, if the prole tariat is victorious in the most important capitalist countries, and if the present capitalist encirclement is replaced by a Socialist encirclement, a ‘ peaceful ’ path of development is quite possible for certain capitalist countries, whose capitalists, in view of the ‘ unfavourable ’ international situation, will con sider it expedient ‘ voluntarily ’ to make substantial concessions to the proletariat. But this supposition applies only to a remote and possible future. With regard to the immediate future, there is no ground whatsoever for this supposition.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 45.) 20. “ Further, if the passing of slow quantitative changes into rapid and abrupt qualitative changes is a law of development, then it Is clear that revo lutions made by oppressed classes are a quite natural and inevitable phenomenon.8 NOTES which will take the form of a protracted and violent struggle to the death [Note 21]. This revolution must be prepared by aggravating the contradictions which are already undermining the strength of the capitalist system [Note 22]. These contra dictions are three in number [Note 23] :— (a) That between labour and capital. (b) That between the Imperialist Powers. (c) That between the ruling nations and the colonial and dependent peoples. These contradictions must be exploited [Note 24] and Social Democracy, which tends to gloss over them, must be ceaselessly attacked [Note 25]. Eventually these con tradictions will bring about the downfall of imperialism; but iji the meanwhile there may be—and indeed there probably will be “ Hence the transition from capitalism to socialism and the liberation of the working class from the yoke of capitalism cannot be effected by slow changes, by reforms, but only by a qualitative change of the capitalist system, by revolution. “ Hence, in order not to err in policy, one must be a revolutionary, not a reformist.” (Short History, p. 111.) 21. ‘‘ Revolution, the replacement of one social structure by another, was always a struggle, a harsh and cruel struggle, a struggle for life and death .... As you see, for Communists the process of replacing one social structure by another is not simply a spontaneous and peaceful process, but a complex, protracted and violent process.” (Con versation with H. G. Wells, 1934. Problems of Leninism, 10th Russian edition, p. 608.) 22. “ Further, if development proceeds by way of the disclosure of internal contradictions, by way of collisions between opposite forces on the basis of these contradictions and so as to overcome these contradictions, then it is clear that the class struggle of the proletariat is a quite natural and inevitable phenomen. “ Hence we must not cover up the contradictions of the capitalist system, but disclose and unravel them; we must not try to check the class struggle but carry it to its conclusion. . “ Hence, in order not to err in policy, one must pursue an uncompromising proletarian class policy, not a reformist policy of harmony of the interests of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, not a com promisers’ policy of ‘ the growing of capitalism into socialism.’ ” (Short History, p. 111.) 23. “ Of these contradictions, there are three which must be regarded as the most important. “ The first contradiction is the contradiction between labour and capital .... “ The second contradiction is the contradiction among the various financial groups and imperialist Powers in their strqggle for sources of raw materials, for foreign territory .... “ The third contradiction is the contradiction between the handful of ruling, ‘ civilised ’ nations and the hundreds of millions of the colonial and dependent peoples of the world .... “ Such, in general, are the principal contradic tions of imperialism which have converted the old, ‘ flourishing ’ capitalism into moribund capitalism.” (Problems of Leninism, pp. 15 and 16.) 24. ” . . . . contradictions, conflicts and wars (the imperialist war, for instance) among the bourgeois States hostile to the proletarian State, can be utilised by the proletariat in its offensive or in manoeuvring in the event of a forced retreat.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 71.) 25. ‘‘ A chasm opened between social-democracy and Marxism. Henceforth, the only vehicle and bul wark of Marxism is Leninism, communism. ” But matters did not end there. The October Revolution went further than drawing a line of demarcation b#tween social democracy and Marx ism; it cast social democracy into the camp of the downright defenders of capitalism against the first proletarian dictatorship in the world Present- day social democratism is an ideological prop of capitalism. Lenin was a thousand times right when he said that the present Social Democratic politicians are ‘ real agents of the bourgeoisie in the labour movement, the labour lieutenants of the capitalist class,’ that in the ‘ civil war between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie ’ they would inevitably range themselves ‘ on the side of Versailles against the Communards.’ It is impos sible to put an end to capitalism without putting an end to social democratism in the labour movement.” (Problems of Leninism., pp. 204 and 205.) ” In order that the fight against social democracy may be carried on successfully, attention must be concentrated on fighting the so-called ‘ Left ’ wing of social democracy, that ‘ Left ’ wing which, by9 110-40 c —a series of conflicts [Note 26] stretching over a period of many years [Note 27 j between the U.S.S.R. and the outside world. During-this period of conflict, in accordance with the law of the uneven de velopment of capitalism, the balance of power will constantly be changing between the capitalist States; and the changing balance of power will require a constant redistribution of markets, colonies and spheres of influence. Such redistributions cannot be effected peacefully, and in conse quence the capitalist States will tend to fight among themselves [Note 28]. Alter natively they will try to find a way out of their difficulties at the expense of the U.S.S.R. [Note 29]. It follows that so long as the capitalist environment exists, there will be a danger of war [Note 30]. All these doctrines are indissociably con nected with Stalin’s philosophy of history. ^ The connexion is set out in detail in sec tion 2 of chapter IV of the Short His tory of the Communist Party, in which he shows how the dialectical study of nature and society leads to his principles of political action. It should never for a moment be forgotten that this basic philosophy and its accompanying strategy underlie and will outlast any tactical deviations which Stalin may have occasion to make. The Implications of the “ Two Worlds ” Theory 7. Stalin’s analysis of the international situation demands that the Soviet Union should do everything in its power to ^strengthen itself and weaken its potential enemies. The Strengthening of the U.S.S.R. 8. The internal measures which Stalin has taken to strengthen the U.S.S.R.—the development of the war potential of the country and of its armed forces, the col lectivisation of its agriculture, his far- reaching security measures, his totalitarian political system with its emphasis on ortho doxy of action and belief, his pursuit of economic autarchy and his suppression of contacts with the outside world—do not come within the scope of this paper, which is concerned chiefly with international affairs. The external military measures which the Soviet Government has taken since the end of the second world war to strengthen its position—the establishment NOTES playing with ‘ Left ’ phrases and thus adroitly fooling the workers, is retarding their defection from social democracy. It is obvious that unless the ‘ Left ’ social democrats are smashed it will be impossible to overcome social democracy as a whole.” (Problems of Leninism, pp. 245 and 246.) 26. “ ‘ We are 'living,’ says Lenin, ‘ not merely in a State, but in a system of States, and the existence of the Soviet Kepublic side by side with imperialist States for a long time is unthinkable. One or the other must triumph in the end. And before that end supervenes a series of frightful collisions between the Soviet Kepublic and the bourgeois States will be inevitable. That means that if the ruling class, the proletariat, wants to hold sway, it must prove its capacity to do so by military organisation also.” (Lenin, Selected Works, vol. VIII, p. 33.) (Problems of Leninism, p. 160.) 27. ” . . . . the transition from capitalism to communism, must not be regarded as a fleeting period of ‘ super-revolutionary ’ acts and decrees, but as an entire historical era, replete with civil wars and external conflicts, with persistent organisa tional work and economic construction, with advances and retreats, victories and defeats “ You will have to go through fifteen, twenty, fifty years of civil w^ars and international conflicts, not only to change existing conditions, but also to change yourselves and to make yourselves capable of wielding political power.” (Marx, quoted in Problems of Leninism, p. 41.) 28. ” The monopolistic possession of ‘ spheres of influence ’ and colonies; the uneven development of the different capitalist countries, leading to a frenzied struggle for the redivision of the world between the countries which have already seized territories and those claiming their ‘ share ’; imperialist wars as the only method of restoring the disturbed ‘ equilibrium ’—all this leads to the aggravation of the third front, the inter-capitalist front, which weakens imperialism and facilitates the amalgamation of the first two fronts against imperialism: the front of the revolutionary proletariat and the front of colonial emancipation. ‘‘Hence the third conclusion: that under imperialism wars cannot be averted, and that a coalition between the proletarian revolution in Europe and the colonial revolution in the East in a united world front of revolution against the world front of imperialism is inevitable.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 30.) 29. ‘‘ Every time, when the contradictions of capitalism begin to grow acute, the bourgeoisie directs its gaze towards the U.S.S.R.; would it not be possible to solve this or that contradiction of capitalism, or all the contradictions together, at the expense of the U.S.S.R Hence the tendency towards wild attacks on the U.S.S.R. and towards intervention, a tendency which must grow stronger in connexion with the development of the economic crisis.” (Problems of Leninism, 10th Russian edition, p. 357.) 30. ‘‘ The war broke out as an inevitable result of the development of world economic and political forces on the basis of modern monopoly capitalism. .... Perhaps the catastrophes of war could be avoided if there existed the possibility of periodically redistributing raw materials and markets among countries in accordance with their economic weight— by means of adopting co-ordinated and peaceful decisions. This, however, cannot be accomplished under present capitalist conditions of the develop ment of world economy. Thus the first crisis of the capitalist system of the world economy resulted in the first world war and the second crisis resulted in the second world war.” (Stalin’s election speech, 9th February, 1946.)10 of a security belt along the western fron tiers of the U.S.S.R., and the standardisa tion of armaments with certain countries of the Soviet orbit—follow logically from Stalin’s analysis of relations between the Soviet and non-Soviet worlds. The poli tical and economic measures now being taken by the Soviet Government to strengthen its position in the post-war world also lit exactly into the pattern of his basic teachings. 9. Stalin, who has always paid great attention to the question of his allies [Note 31] has constantly maintained that the natural external allies of the Soviet Union were the Communist Parties and the workers of industrially advanced countries and the liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries. This doctrine corresponds with Zhdanov’s statement at the recent Conference of European Com munist Parties that “ The anti-imperialist camp bases itself on the support of the workers and democratic movements in all countries, on the fraternal Communist Parties in all countries, on the fighters of the National Liberation Movement in the colonies and dependent countries, and on the support of all the democratic forces which exist in every country.” It follows that Stalin's basic ideas regarding the international disposition of forces have re mained unchanged since 1924. It must however, be added that Stalin s teaching insists on the Communists being the domi nant partners in any alliance in which they participate [Note 32]. 10. The foregoing quotation from Zhdanov shows that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union still assumes that the Communist Parties of other countries will always support the policies of the U.S.S.R. In this Zhdanov is confirming the realisation of the following principle laid down by Stalin in 1927 : “ In present conditions one cannot call oneself a Marxist unless one openly and devotedly supports the first proletarian dictatorship in the world ” (Problems of Leninism, p. 204). 11. For the greater part of the inter-war period, Communist interest in the £ ‘ libera tion movements of the colonial and depen dent countries ” was half-hearted. But the post-war world has provided opportunities for increased activity, and the Soviet claim to be the champion of the sovereignty and independence of colonial and dependent territories has been made the subject of intensive propaganda intended to win friends for the Soviet Union and to increase Soviet influence in independence movements throughout the world. NOTES 31. “ Those who are marching towards and pre paring to assume power cannot but be interested in the question of who are their real allies. (Problems of Leninism, p. 49.) 82. “ It must only be borne in mind that the alliance of workers and peasants under the dictatorship of the proletariat is not an ordinal y alliance. It is a special form of class alliance between the working class and the labouring masses of the peasantry, which sets itself the object: (a) of strengthening the position of the working class, (b) of ensuring the leading role of the working class within this alliance; (c) of abolishing classes and class society. Any other conception of the alliance of workers and peasants is opportunism, Men- shevism, S.-R.-ism—anything you like, but not Marxism, not Leninism.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 215.) “ This does not mean, of course, that the proletariat must support every peasant movement. What we have in mind here is support for those movements and those struggles of the peasantry which, directly or indirectly, assist the emancipation movement of'the proletariat, which, in one way or another, bring grist to the mill of the proletarian revolution, which help to transform the peasantry into a reserve and ally of the working class. (Problems of Leninism, p. 50.)11 110-40 NOTES 12. The propaganda put out by the Soviet Union about the virtues of Soviet internal and external policy is calculated to serve the same purpose. The current aims and the nature of this propaganda were set out in detail in Zhdanov’s speech to the confer ence which established the Cominform. 13. The last of the measures taken by the Soviet Union to strengthen itself against the outside world is its policy of economic autarchy and its refusal to con clude economic agreements which might weaken its position vis-a-vis the countries of the capitalist camp [Note 33]. The Weakening of the Non-Soviet World 14. The efforts being made by the Soviet Government to weaken their potential enemies are an even more striking indica tion of their adherence to Stalin’s basic doctrines. Their propaganda is designed to stir up trouble between capital and labour, between Britain and the United States, between Latin America and the United States, between the United States and the countries which hope to benefit from the Marshall Plan, and between the colonial Powers and their colonies and dependencies [cf. Note 23]. In accord ance with the principle that the difficulties of the capitalist system must be aggra vated, Soviet propaganda is attacking everything which promises to solve these difficulties [cf. Note 22]. It is criticising Social Democracy because it tends to pre vent class war [cf. Note 25]; it is dis paraging everything that has been achieved since the end of the Second World War in the field of colonial reforms because the maintenance of discontent in the colonies is to the advantage of the Soviet Union. x\nd it is opposed to all international groupings of which the Soviet Union is not a member, partly because Stalin’s doc trines call for the promotion of discord between non-Soviet Powers, and partly because of a fear that any such groupings will be directed against the U.S.S.R [Note 34]. Breaching the Wall of Capitalism 15. The territorial acquisitions made by the U.S.S.R. during the war and the Soviet policy in South-Eastern Europe and Poland since the end of the war have shown that Stalin still adheres to his maxim of breaching the wall of capitalism [Note 35], and Zhdanov’s speech to the Communist Parties represented in the Cominform provided confirmation that the leaders of the U.S.S.R. regard their suc cesses in Eastern Europe in precisely this light [Note 36]. 33. “ We can never accept conditions of bon dage.” (Stalin’s “ Interview with the First American Labour Delegation in Russia,’’ 9th September, 1927.) Cf. following quotation from Zhdanov’s speech to the foundation conference of the Cominform: — ” The Soviet Union .... has always maintained that credit conditions should not have an enslaving character, and should never lead to the economic and political subjugation of the debtor State by the creditor State. Proceeding from the same political contention, the Soviet Union has always maintained the attitude that foreign credks should not be the main means for the rehabilitation of a country’s economy Only on such conditions can a country’s independence be safeguarded against the encroachments of foreign capital, which is always apt to display a tendency to exploit credit as a means for political and economic enslavement.” 34. ‘ ‘ Is this proposal about a bloc of West Euro pean countries—including France, Belgium, Luxem bourg and Germany, and excluding the Soviet Union—is this a friendly or hostile act in regard to the Soviet Union? In our opinion this act is hostile, and this is not our opinion alone.” (Vyshinsky’s speech of 24th October, 1947, to Political Committee of General Assembly.) 35. ” Now the proletarian revolution must be regarded primarily as the result of the development of the contradictions within the world system of imperialism, as the result of the snapping of the chain of the imperialist world front in one country or another. “ Where will the revolution begin? Where, in what country, can the front of capital be pierced first? ” Where industry is more developed, where the proletariat constitutes the majority, w'here there is more culture, where there is more democracy—that w r as the reply usually given formerly. ‘‘ No, objects the Leninist theory of revolution; not necessarily where industry is more developed, and so forth. The front of capital will be pierced where the chain of imperialism is weakest, for the proletarian revolution is the result of the breaking of the chain of the world imperialist front at its weakest link; . . . .” (Problems of Leninism, p. 31.) 36. “ If the most important result of the first w T orld war was the breaching of the united imperialist front with Russia’s breaking away from the world system of capitalism and, as a result of the victory of the Socialist rdgime in the U.S.S.R., the end of capitalism as an all-embracing system of w r orld rule; then the second world war, the rout of fascism, the weakening of the world position of capitalism and the strengthening of the anti- Fascist movement led to the breaking away from the imperialist system of a number of countries of Central and South-Eastern Europe.” (Zhdanov, Review of World Situation, Foundation meeting of Cominform.) (Continued over page)12 Spreading the Soviet Variety of Socialism 16. The corollary of breaching the wall of capitalism is the spreading of the Soviet variety of socialism to other countries [Note 37]. Stalin has always held that the Soviet Union will not be safe against inter vention and the risk of a restoration of the pre-revolutionary order of things until the Soviet variety of socialism has been estab lished in ‘ a number ’ of other countries. Moreover, at the 17th Party Congress in January 1934 he said that if there were to be a second world war, “it is sure to unleash revolution and jeopardise the very existence of capitalism in a number of countries It can hardly be doubted that a second war against the U.S.S.R. will lead to the complete defeat of the aggres sors, to revolution in a number of countries in Europe and in Asia, and to the destruc tion of the frowr^ecus-landlord Govern ments in those countries ’’ (Problems of Leninism, pp. 462 and 464). Much of this prophecy has come true. Moreover, it is clear from Zhdanov’s remarks about Viet- Nam and Indonesia in his speech to the Communist Parties represented in the Cominform that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is still thinking in terms of swinging colonial and dependent countries from one camp into the other. This is an old idea of Stalin’s [Note 38] now being developed after twenty years of relative inactivity. It follows from this that Stalin’s teachings about the establish ment of socialism in other countries and the attraction of these Socialist countries into the orbit of the U.S.S.R. call for examination as a guide to Soviet policy in the near future. 17. His general approval of the strategy of extending the Soviet variety of socialism to other countries is subject to two main qualifications: first, that independence movements in colonies and dependent countries must only be encouraged when they promise to further the interests of the U.S.S.R. as the leading country of world revolution [Note 39]; and, secondly, that revolution should not be tried until there is virtual certainty of rapid success [Note 40] His injunction to Communists NOTES 37. “ Docs it mean that with the forces of only one country it can finally consolidate socialism and fully guarantee that country against intervention and, consequently, also against restoration? No, it does not. Nor this the victory of the revolution in at least several countries is needed. Therefore, the devekqmieiyt and support of revolution in other countries is an essential task of the victorious revo lution. Therefore, the revolutipn in the victorious country must regard itself not as a self-sufficient entity, but as an aid, as a means of hastening the victory of the proletariat in other countries. “ Lenin expressed this thought in a nutshell when he said that the task of the victorious revolution is to do ‘ the utmost possible in one country for the development, support and awakening of the revo lution in all countrfes.’ ” (Lenin, Selected Works, vol. VII, p. 182.) (Problems of Leninism, p. 38.) “ It goes without saying that for the complete victory of socialisjn, for complete security against the restoration of the old order, the united efforts of the proletarians of several countries are neces sary.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 105.) 38., ‘‘ Are the revolutionary possibilities latent in the revolutionary liberation movement of the oppressed countries already exhausted or not; and if not, is there any hope, any ground to expect that these possibilities can be utilised for the proletarian revolution, that the dependent and colonial countries can be transformed from a reserve of the imperialist bourgeoisie into a reserve of the revolutionary proletariat, into an ally of the latter? ” (Problems of Leninism, p. 61.) 39. ” This does not mean, of course, that the proletariat must support every national movement, everywhere and always, in every single concrete case. It means that support must be given to such national movements as tend to weaken, to over throw imperialism, and not to strengthen and pre serve it. Cases occur when the national movements in certain oppressed countries come into conflict with the interests of the development of the prole tarian movement. In such cases support is, of course, entirely out of the question. The question of the rights of nations is not an isolated, self- sufficient question; it is a part of the general problem of the proletarian revolution, subordinate to the whole, and must be considered from the point of view of the whole.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 62 .) “ It should be borne in mind that besides the right of nations to self-determination there is also the right of the working class to consolidate its power, and to this latter right the right of self- determination is subordinate. There are occasions when the right of self-determination conflicts with the other, the higher right, the right of a working class which has assumed power to consolidate that power. In such cases—this must be said bluntly— the right to self-determination cannot and must not serve as an obstacle to the exercise by the working class of its right to dictatorship.” (Report to the 12th Congress of the Communist Party, 23rd April, 1923.) 40. ” Never play with insurrection, but when beginning it firmly realise that you must go to the end. You must concentrate a great superiority of forces at the decisive point, at the decisive moment, otherwise the enemy, who has the advantage of better preparation and organisation, will destroy the insurgents. Once the insurrection has begun, you must act with the greatest determination, and by all means, without fail, take the offensive. ‘ The defensive is the death of every armed rising.’ You must try to take the enemy by surprise and seize the moment when his forces are scattered. You must strive for daily successes, even if small (one might say hourly, if it is the case of one town), and at all costs retain ‘moral ascendancy.'” (Lenin, Collected Works, vol. XXI, Russian edition, pp. 319-20.) (Problems of Leninism, pp. 72 and 73.)13 D 2 110-40 is not to play at revolution. Before they start, they must be sure they can carry it through to the end. Subject to these two qualifications, Stalin is in favour of estab lishing the Soviet system outside the borders of' the U.S.S.R. [Note 41]. Long-Term Colonial Designs 18. In view of this, it is worth recalling that, according to his basic doctrine, the separation of colonies from their metro politan Powers is advocated by communism with a view to their ultimate incorporation into a union of nations based on the model of the U.S.S.R. [Note 42]; and that, according to Zhdanov's speech at the foundation meeting of the Cominform, the time for the separation of the colonies is now ripe [ see Note 44]. ‘-n When to Resort to Revolution 19. Although the colonies are not being neglected, the point of chief interest at the present time is Stalin’s teaching on the circumstances in which Communist parties outside the U.S.S.R. may start a revolution. 20. His first stipulation is that revolu tion should not be undertaken until over whelming forces have been concentrated at the enemy’s most vulnerable spot [Note 43]. This concentration should be effected at the decisive moment, when revolution is knocking on the door. This happens “only when the “lower classes ' do not want the old way and when the “ upper classes ” cannot carry on in the old way — only then can revolution triumph [Note 44]. Stalin quotes Lenin as saying “ The decisive battle may be deemed to ^ have fully matured when £ all the class forces hostile to us have become sufficiently entangled, are sufficiently at loggerheads with each other, have sufficiently weakened themselves in a struggle which is beyond their strength ’; when ‘ all the vacilla ting, wavering, unstable, intermediate elements—the petty bgurgeoisie —have sufficiently exposed themselves in the eyes of the people, have sufficiently disgraced themselves through their practical bank ruptcy’; when ‘among the proletariat a mass sentiment in favour of supporting the most determined, supremely bold, revolu tionary action against the bourgeoisie has arisen and begun vigorously to grow. Then revolution is indeed ripe; then, indeed, if we have correctly gauged all the conditions indicated .... above, and if we have chosen the moment rightly, our victory is assured’ ” (Problems of Lenin ism, p. 73). NOTES 41. “But, as is well known, Lenin’s theory of revolution is not limited only to this side of the question. It is also the theory of the development of the world revolution. The victory of socialism in one country is not a self-sufficient task. The revolu tion which has been victorious in one country must regard itself not as a self-sufficient entity, but as an aid, a means for hastening the victory of the proletariat in all countries. For the victory of the revolution in one country, in the present case Kussia, is not only the product of the uneven development and progressive decay of imperialism; it is at the same time the beginning of and the ground-work for the world revolution.’’ (Problems of Leninism, p. 120.) 42. “ The Soviet power is the most inter nationalist of all State organisations in class society, for, since it destroys every kind of national oppres sion and rests on the collaboration of the labouring masses of the various nationalities, it facilitates, by virtue of this, the amalgamation of these masses into a single State union.’’ (Problems of Leninism, P- 47.) . * , “ Communism knows that the union of the nations in a single world economic system is possible only on the basis of mutual confidence and voluntary agreement, and that the road to the formation of a voluntary union of nations lies through the separa tion of the colonies from the ‘ integral ’ imperialist ‘ whole,’ through the transformation of the colonies into independent States.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 65.) “ . . . . that remarkable organisation for the collaboration of nations which is called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics—the living prototype of the future union of nations in a single world economic system. (Problems of Leninism, p. 66.)• “ The weight of emphasis in the internationalist education of the workers in the oppressing countries must necessarily consist in advocating and urging them to demand freedom of secession for oppressed countries. Without this there can be no inter nationalism. It is our right and duty to treat every Social Democrat of an oppressing nation who fails to conduct such propaganda as an imperialist and a scoundrel. This is an absolute demand, even if the chance of secession being possible and ‘ feasible ’ before the introduction of socialism is only one in a thousand .... “ On the other hand, a Social Democrat belonging to a small nation must emphasise in his agitation the second word of our general formula: ‘ voluntary union ’ of nations. He may, without violating his duties as an internationalist, be in favour of either the political independence of his nation or its inclusion in a neighbouring State X, Y, Z, &amp;c. But in all cases he must fight against small-nation narrow'-mindedness, insularity and aloofness, he must fight for the recognition of the whole and the general, for the subordination of the interests of the particular to the interests of the general.” (Lenin, Collected Works, Russian edition, vol. XIX, pp. 261-262.) (Problems of Leninism, p. 67.) 43. “ . . . . the concentration of the main forces of the revolution at the enemy’s most vulnerable spot at the decisive moment, when the revolution has already become ripe, wffien the offensive is going full-steam ahead, wdien insurrection is knocking at; the door, and when bringing the reserves up to the vanguard is the decisive condition of success.’' (Problems of Leninism, p. 72.) 44. “ it is not enough for revolution that the exploited and oppressed masses should under stand the impossibility of living in the old way and demand changes; it is essential for revolution that the exploiters should not be able to live and rule in the old way. Only when the ‘ lower classes ’ do not want the old way, and w T hen the ‘ upper classes ' cannot carry on in the old way —only then can revo lution triumph. This truth’may be expressed in14 The Consolidation of Gains Won by Revo lution 21. Provided these conditions are ful filled, Stalin recommends that the prole tariat should boldly start a revolution, even though it is a minority movement [Note 45]. The seizure of power by a minority demands the use of armed force to overthrow the existing authorities, and it cannot be over emphasised how much importance Stalin, who learnt a good deal from the failure of the 1905 insurrection, attaches to arms, synchronisation and co ordination in the conduct of a revolution [Note 46]. But for him the successful conclusion of the fighting is only a begin ning. Once the Communists are in power, they must destroy the old machinery oi Government and undertake the long and difficult task of eradicating all traces of bourgeois influence and capitalist men tality [Note 47]. To this end the resistance of the landowners and capita lists must be smashed, the workers must be rallied round the Communist parties and an army must be organised to deal with external enemies [Note 48]. These tasks NOTES other words: Revolution is impossible without a, natioyi-wide crisis [affecting both the exploited ond the exploiters). It follows that for revolution it is essential, first, that a majority of the workers (or at least a majority of the class-conscious, thinking, politically active workers) should fully understand that revolution is necessary and be ready to sacrifice their lives for it; secondly, that the ruling classes should be passing through a governmental crisis, which draws even the most backward masses into politics .... weaken the Government and make it possible for the revolutionaries to overthrow it rapidly.” (Lenin, Selected Works, vol. X, p. 127.) [Problems of Leninism, p. 38.) That this idea is still running through the minds of the rulers of the U.S.S.R. is shown by the following excerpt from Zhdanov’s speech at the foundation meeting of the Cominform: ‘‘The peoples of the colonies no longer want to live in the old way. The ruling classes in the mother countries can no longer administer the colonies in the old way.” 45. “ The opportunists assert that the proletariat cannot and ought not to take power unless it consti tutes a majority in the country. No proofs are adduced, for there are no proofs, either theoretical or practical, that can justify this absurd thesis .... suppose a historical situation has arisen (a war, an agrarian crisis, &amp;c.) in which the proletariat, consti tuting a minority of the population, has an oppor tunity to rally around itself the vast majority of the labouring masses; why should it not take power then? Why should not the proletariat take advantage of a favourable international and internal situation to pierce the front of capital and hasten the general issue? ” [Problems of Leninism, p. 22.) 46. “We went into action without arms, bare handed, and that is why we failed. ‘ Arms, Oh give us arms! ’ cried the insurgent proletariat in desperation. At the.sight of the enemy they ground their teeth, flung themselves into battle like heroes, but because they had no arms they were vanquished in the struggle. Hence it follows beyond doubt that first of all we must arm, and, being armed, make a concerted attack on the enemy.” (Stalin’s leaflet What are the Facts? issued by the All-Caucasian Committee of Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, 26th March, 1905.) ‘ ‘ The hour of insurrection is nigh! It is imperative that it find us fully armed. Only then, only with a general, nation-wide and simultaneous armed insurrection, can we defeat our vile enemy . . . .” (Attributed to Stalin by L. Beria, On the History of Bolshevik Organisations in Trans caucasia, p. 62.) 47. “ The Socialist revolution is not an unex pected and instantaneous blow—it is the prolonged action of the proletarian masses, who attack and capture the positions of the bourgeoisie.' (Stalin: “ Anarchism or Socialism,” article quoted in L. Beria, On the History of Bolshevik Organisations in Transcaucasia, pp. 98-106.) 48. “ 4 The fundamental question of revolution is the question of power.’ (Lenin) .... The seizure of power is only the beginning. For many reasons the bourgeoisie that is overthrown in one country remains for a long time stronger than the proletariat which has overthrown it. Therefore, the whole point is to retain power, to consolidate it, to make it invincible. What is needed to attain this? To attain this it is necessary to carry out at least the three main tasks that confront the dictatorship of the proletariat 4 on the morrow ’ of victory: — “ [a) to break the resistance of the landlords and capitalists who have been overthrown and expro priated by the revolution, to liquidate every attempt on their part to restore the power of capital; 44 (6) to organise construction in such a way as to rally all the labouring people around the prole tariat, and to carry on this work along the lines of15 NOTES will take a whole historical epoch [Note 49], and will require the dictatorship of the proletariat, which Stalin, quoting Lenin, dehned as ‘ c a persistent struggle, bloody and bloodless, violent and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative, against the forces and traditions of the old society.” {Problems of Leninism, p. 41). Stalin also quotes Lenin as saying that “ the dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, i.e., the victory of the democratic revolution ’ ’ is not “ the organisation of order,” but t£ the organisation of • war ’ ’ {Problems of Leninism, p. 34). Stalin envisages the con solidation of the dictatorship of the prole tariat as a gradual process, proceeding side by side with the remorseless undermining of the landowners and the bourgeoisie and the suppression of any opposition which ^may be offered by representatives of the old society. He frankly admits that the dictatorship of the proletariat, like any other dictatorship, is an instrument in the hands of the ruling class for the sup pression of its enemies [Note 50]; but Stalin differs from other dictators in that he does not conceal his belief that his principles for establishing and consolida ting the dictatorship of the proletariat in the U.S.S.R. are well adapted to facilitate the spread of revolution to third countries [see Note 54], and to replace the old governments and parties of those countries by new regimes subservient to the U.S.S.R. and based on his principle of starting with Communist hegemony and finishing with Communist dictatorship [Note 51]. The forms of government adopted by these sub- ^ servient States may vary, but their essence will always be the same : the dictatorship of the proletariat [Note 52]. Moreover, the process of building up the dictatorship of the proletariat is an expanding one and may be expected to lead to the spread of revolution to other countries [Note 53]. The New Form of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat 22. The extension to non-Russian States of the Soviet method of establishing the dictatorshp of the proletariat was fore shadowed by Stalin as long ago as December 1924 [Note 54]. The applica tion of Stalin’s tactics in present-day conditions was described by Marshal Tito in his speech of 27th September, 1947, and by Zhdanov, in his speech to the meeting which established the Cominform. 23. These speeches and the declaration of the Cominform envisage the steady consolidation of the “ dictatorship of the preparing for the liquidation, the abolition of classes; “ (c) to arm the revolution, to organise the army of the revolution for the struggle against foreign enemies, for the struggle against imperialism. “ The dictatorship of the proletariat is needed to carry out, to fulfil these tasks.” (Problems of Leninism, pp. 39-^40.) 49. ‘‘ ‘ The transition from capitalism to com munism,’ says Lenin, ‘ represents an entire histori cal epoch.’ ” (Problems of Leninism, p. 40.) 50. “ The dictatorship of the proletariat arises not on the basis of the bourgeois order, but in the process of the breaking up of this order, in the process of the expropriation of the landlords and capitalists, in the process of the socialisation of the principal instruments and means of production, in the process of violent proletarian revolution. The dictatorship of the proletariat is revolutionary power based on the use of force against the bourgeoisie. The State is a machine in the hands of the ruling class for suppressing the resistance of its class enemies. In this respect the dictatorship of the proletariat is no different in essence from the dic tatorship of any other class, for the proletarian State is a machine for the suppression of the bourgeoisie.' (Problems of Leninism, p. 43.) 51. “ The hegemony of the proletariat was the embryo of, and the transition stage to, the dictator ship of the proletariat.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 51.) 52. ” The forms of bourgeois States are extremely varied, but in essence they are all the same; in one way or another, in the final analysis, all these States are inevitably the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The transition from capitalism to communism will certainly create a great variety and abundance of political forms, but their essence will inevitably be the same: the dictatorship of the proletariat.” (Lenin, Selected Works, vol. VII, p. 34, in Problems of Leninism, p. 636.) 53. “ Marx proposed only that the work of the revolution be crowned with the establishment of proletarian State power, by hurling, step by step, one section of the bourgeoisie after another from the heights of power, in order, after the attainment of power by the proletariat, to kindle the fire of revolu tion in every country ” (Problems of Leninism, p. 36.) 54. “ One of the peculiar features of the October Kevolution is the fact that this revolution represents the classic application of Lenin’s theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Some com rades believe that this theory is a purely ‘ Eussian ’ theory, applicable only to Russian conditions. That is wrong. It is absolutely wrong .... Lenin’s theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat is not a purely ‘ Russian ’ theory, but a theory which applies to all countries. Bolshevism is not only a Russian phenomenon. ‘Bolshevism,’ say Lenin, is ‘ a model of tactics for all.’ ” (Problems of Leninism, p. 99.) (Continued over page)16 proletariat” in the guise of “People’s Fronts,” consisting of blocs of parties accepting the programme and the leader ship of the Communist parties of their respective countries. In spite of Soviet propaganda about the right of small nations to self-determination, no country bordering on the Soviet Union in which the “ dictatorship of the proletariat ” has once been established can expect ever to be allowed to leave the Soviet bloc [Note 55]. Conclusion 24. It would be consistent with Stalin’s teaching for the Communists in other countries to launch a revolution if, but only if, the conditions set out in paragraph 20 are realised. If the Marshall Plan fails, if the Council of Foreign Ministers fails to reach agreement about Germany, and if economic difficulties lead to political dead lock in Western Europe, the resulting con ditions might approximate closely to those specified by Stalin as propitious for a Com munist revolution. It is unlikely that the Communists would begin a revolution unless they were confident of quick success [Note 56]; but if they did begin, they would no doubt carry it through with the utmost determination. 25. Again, according to Stalin’s teach ing, this would involve a grave risk of intervention from both sides. The danger of capitalist intervention was an important theme in Stalin’s writings in the years immediately following the 1917 revolution [Note 57], and as late as 1938 he was still insisting on this danger [Note 8]. But in spite of his fear of intervention, even at the time when the U .S.S.R. was weak he wrote that it would pay to help the'cause of revolution in other countries, if neces sary with armed force [Note 58]. The most recent edition of Problems of Leninism includes his statements that the revolution is still under way [Note 59] and that he believes that it is to the interest of the U.S.S.R. to further the cause of the NOTES 55. “ When a life and death struggle is being waged, and is spreading between proletarian Russia and the imperialist entente, only two alternatives confront the border regions: either they join forces with Russia, and then the toiling masses of the border regions will be emancipated from imperialist oppression; or they join forces with the entente, and then the yoke of imperialism is inevitable. There is no third solution. The so-called independence of a so-called independent Georgia, Armenia, Roland, Finland, &amp;c., is only an illusion, and conceals the utter dependence of those apologies for States on one group of imperialists or another. Of course, the border regions of Russia, the nations and tribes which inhabit these regions, just as all other nations, possess the inalienable right to secede from Russia, and if any of these nations decided by a majority to secede from Russia, as was the case with h inland in 1917, Russia, presumably, would be obliged to record the fact and sanction the secession. But the question here is not that of the indubitable rights of nations, but of. the interests of the masses of the people both in the centre and the border regions; it it a question of the character—determined by those interests—of the agitation which our party must carry on if it does not wish to repudiate itself and if it wishes to influence the will of the toiling masses of^ the nationalities in a definite direction. And the ^ interests of tlie masses of the people render the demand for the secession of the border regions at the present stage of the revolution a profoundly counter-revolutionary one.” (Extract from Pravda, 10th October, 1920.) 56. “ The overthrow of the bourgeoisie can be successfully accomplished only when certain absolutely necessary conditions exist, in the absence of which there can be even no question of the pro letariat taking power.” (Problems of Leninism, P- 37.) , . 57. ” It should not be forgotten that for the time being the revolution has been victorious in only one country. It should not be forgotten that as long as the' capitalist encirclement exists the danger of intervention, with all the consequences resulting from this danger, will exist.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 136.) 58. “ While it is true that the final victory of socialism in the first country to emancipate itself is impossible without the combined efforts of the proletarians of several countries, it is equally true that the development of the world revolution will be the more rapid and thorough, the more effective the assistance rendered by the first Socialist country to the workers and labouring masses of all other countries. “ In what should this assistance be expressed? “ It should be expressed, first, in the victorious country achieving the utmost possible in one country for the development, support and awaken ing of the revolution in all countries.’ ” (Lenin, Selected Works, vol. VII, p. 182.) “ Second, it should be expressed in that the ‘ victorious proletariat ’ of one country, having expropriated the capitalists and organised its own Socialist production, would stand up against the rest of the world, the capitalist world, attracting to its cause the oppressed classes of other countries, raising revolts in those countries against the capitalists, and in the event of necessity coming out even with armed force against the exploiting classes and their States.’ ” (Lenin, Selected Works, vol. V, p. 141.) (Problems of Leninism, p. 122.) 59. “ Consequently, Lenin fought the adherents of ' permanent ’ revolution, not over the question of uninterruptedness, for he himself maintained the point of view of uninterrupted revolution, but because they underestimated the role of the peasantry . . . .” (Problems of Leninism, p. 36.)17 revolution in other countries [Note 60]; he realises that this may involve intervention on both sides, and given his preference for not fighting until he is sure to win, he may be expected to show prudence and to limit the risk of intervention. But he believes that the economic difficulties of the capita list world are in themselves likely to lead to intervention and war [see Note 29] and the establishment of the Cominform shows that he seems to take seriously the danger of a third world war arising according to Marxist theory out of the economic crisis which the Russians so confidently expect in the west. If therefore revolution were to break out in any important country of Western Europe, we must not exclude the possibility that Stalin might be guided, other things being equal, by the revolu tionary aspect of his ideology [Note 61], ^which has been relatively dormant for twenty-six years. NOTES 60. “ Formerly it was the accepted thing to speak of the proletarian revolution in one or another developed country as of something separate and self-sufficient, facing a separate national front of capital as its opposite. Now, this point of view is no longer adequate. Now we must speak of the w'orld proletarian revolution; for the separate national fronts of capital have become links in a single chain called the world front of imperialism, which must be opposed by a common front of the revolutionary movement in all countries. (Problems of Leninism, p. 31.) 61. “ . . . . we are doing work which, if success ful, will change the whole world and free the entire working class.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 357.) ” . . . . the October Revolution is a revolution of an international, world order.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 198.) ” . . . . the October Revolution has ushered in a new era, the era of proletarian revolutions in the countries of imperialism.’' (Problems of Leninism, p. 199.) ” . . . . the October Revolution has ushered in a new era, the era of colonial revolutions which are being conducted in the oppressed countries of the world, in alliance with the proletariat and under the leadership of the proletariat.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 201.) . . . While shaking imperialism, the October Revolution has at the same time created—in the first proletarian dictatorship—a powerful and open base for the world revolutionary movement, a base such as the world revolutionary movement never possessed before and on which it can now rely. It has created a powerful and open centre of the world revolutionary movement, such as the world revolu tionary movement never possessed before and around which it can now rally and organise a united revolutionary front of the proletarians and of the oppressed nations of all countries against imperial ism.” (Problems of Leninism, p. 202.) *mmmuii His Excellency the Political Persian Gulf, presents his compliments Resident, tos- The Political Agent, (B/208 -83/7) The Political Agent, (K/80 -83/7) The Political Agent, (U/75 -83/7) Muscat # y and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned document/* PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, Dated the 1st July 1948* BABBAIB* Ss£j&gt;Xgfl.ce„to PXeylpug^gprrgsjgpj^jgnjija* p^?er^pttsA. 9f No*246 Intel of 17th June 1948 from Foreign Office, London* Renewal of Atheist Propaganda in the U.S.S.R.© SJLUL OUTWARD TELEGRAM En Clair (By Confidential Bag).

It is arguable that the temporary divergencies from orthodoxy have been progressively more exaggerated, and each subsequent reversion to the first principles of Soviet Socialism more em phatic and more ruthless. It is beyond argument, however, that extremely wide deviations from the Leninist line were countenanced under the stress of the last war and that the subsequent correction in the present phase is being pressed home with maximum vigour. Any lingering doubts on this score must have been sharply dispelled by the authoritative expositions of Soviet policy given by Zhdanov and Malen kov at the Cominform foundation meeting ^in Poland in September 1947, and by Molotov in his Revolution Anniversary speech on 6th November, 1947. These addresses were obviously intended to serve as fundamental guidance to party propa gandists and instructors inside the Soviet Union and to Communists and their well- wishers everywhere, and they convey the unmistakable message that in this latest period the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and ipso facto the Soviet Govern ment, are openly and unequivocally pur suing the basic aims of Leninism as inter preted and formulated in the writings of Stalin. It is desirable therefore to consider precisely what this return to orthodoxy means as regards both the internal and ex ternal policies of the Soviet Union in the light of the official pronouncement of the Soviet authorities themselves. The Theory of Leninism 2. Orthodox Soviet ideology is the inter pretation of Lenin's doctrines which Stalin, by careful selection, has formulated and put on record. Leninism, in Stalin's defi nition, is 'Marxism of the imperialist epoch and of the proletarian revolution ”; it provides the international proletariat wuth a militant theory and programme, and with the strategy and tactics necessary to accomplish a Socialist resolution and establish the dictatorship of the proleta riat. Its goal is ' the victory of Commu nism throughout the world.” 3. On the basis of Marxist historical materialism, Lenin established the dogma that the end of the 19th century saw capi talism enter its final phase—imperialism. Because of its inherent contradictions, im perialism (i.e., “ capitalism on its death bed ') would inevitably perish, to be replaced by the dictatorship of the prole tariat, which in its turn would usher in the Utopia of communism. Leninists, however, must not await the pre-ordained dissolu tion of capitalism passively—this would be to accept the theory of “spontaneity ' or “ opportunism,” which was vigorously de nounced by both Lenin and Stalin—but must accelerate the process by exposing, aggravating and exploiting the contradic tions of imperialistic capitalism. They must assume and maintain the position of vanguard of the forces aiming to overthrow the old order and ensure that the latter was succeeded by the dictatorship of the prole tariat. (The “ dictatorship of the proleta riat ' is of course a euphemism; it means the dictatorship of the “ vanguard ” of the proletariat, who are, in practice, the small minority of professional revolutionaries). 4. The chief enemies, according to Leninism, are the non-revolutionary refor mists who betray the masses whom they pro-2 fess to represent by softening the capitalist contradictions and blurring the edges of the class struggle by coming to terms with imperialism. ' under a bourgeois regime,'’ said Stalin, “ reformist tactics achieve re forms which serve merely to bolster up that regime and to disrupt the revolutionary forces.' (Leninism, page 158). In all phases of the revolution, therefore, the chief line of attack of the revolutionists must be to isolate, discredit and destroy the reformists, whether these are the bourgeois liberals (as in pre-1917 Russia), the petty bourgeois democrats (as between February and October 1917), or the parties affiliated to the Second International (as after the October Revolution). This, Lenin and Stalin are careful to point out, does not preclude a revolutionist from utilising re forms when they can serve as a revolu tionary tactic to “ re-invigorate the forces of revolution ' and “ serve as a base for the further development of the revolutionary movement.' Stalin is specific on this point: A revolutionist may sponsor a reform because he sees in it a means for linking up constitutional action with un constitutional action, because he feels he can make use of it as a screen behind which he can strengthen this clandestine vrork whose aim it is to educate and prepare the masses for the revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeoisie.' (Leninism, page 158). Ultimately, according to Leninism, there can be no peaceful transition from capi talism to socialism. In Lenin’s own words : “ The proletarian revolution cannot take place without the forcible destruction of the bourgeois state machine and its replace ment by a new machine.’’ (Lenin Works, Volume XV, page 453). 5. The three main contradictions of capitalism are defined as (1) the conflict between labour and capital; (2) the conflict between various financial groups and the different imperialist powers in their com petition for the sources of raw materials and for markets; and (3) the conflict be tween the small group of dominant “ civi lised ” nations, on the one hand, and the hundreds of millions of persons who make up the colonial and dependent peoples of the world, on the other. As imperialism develops, so these contradictions become deeper; the class struggle is sharpened, imperialist wars for the seizure of foreign territory become inevitable, and the build ing of railways and industrial and com mercial centres entailed in the exploitation of backward territories leads to the appearance there of a “proletariat,” the awakening of a national consciousness and the strengthening of the movement for national independence. 6. The Russian revolution was the first great convulsion of capitalism. The fact that it occurred in a notoriously backward country and that it was not immediately followed, as Marx and Lenin had antici pated, by a chain of successful revolutions throughout Europe, is responsible for one of the most important “extensions' of Marxism contributed by Lenin—his formu lation of the law' of unequal economic and political development, as a result of which, he concluded, different countries would achieve the Socialist revolution at different paces and by different methods; in the pro cess they would adopt different forms of Socialist organisation but the result, in essence, would be the same. From this law arose the highly significant theory of the^ possibility of “ socialism in one country alone.” ^ 7. The slogan of “ socialism in one country ” in no way implied the abandon ment of the theory and goal of world revo lution. t£ The world-wide significance of the October Revolution,” Stalin wrote in December 1924, k ‘ lies not only in the fact that it was the first step taken by any country wdiatsoever to shatter imperialism, that it brought into being the first little island of socialism in the ocean of imperi alism, but likewise in the fact that the October Revolution is the first stage in the world revolution and has set up a power ful base from which the world revolution can continue to' develop.” (Leninism, page 216). Stalin explained unequivocally and in scrupulous detail the relationship between “ socialism in one country ” and^ the aim of world revolution, defining the r respective roles of the Soviet Union and the revolutionaries, (i.e., Communists) of other countries. The establishment of socialism within the frontiers of Soviet Russia was possible with the unaided forces of that country, provided only that the Russian workers enjoyed the sympathy and support of the workers in other lands; but for the victory of socialism in one country, in the sense of a full guarantee against the restoration of the old regime, “ the support of our revolution by the workers of all lands and, even more than this, the victory of the workers in a few countries at least, are indispensable preliminary conditions without which there can be no adequate guarantees against intervention in the first land where the workers have been victorious and against a restoration of the old regime there, and without which the3 final triumph of socialism cannot be assured.” (Leninism, page 55). 8. Thus, in Stalin’s view, the best and surest method of attaining world revolu tion was to consolidate and strengthen the bridgehead already won so that at the appropriate time it could be used as a base for further advances. The first task of the Soviet State, therefore, and the duty of Communists everywhere, was to defend the Soviet bridgehead at all costs as the citadel and base of all who sought to bring about the establishment of world communism. Through the Communist International this'view was, in fact, accep ted by the Communist Parties of all countries, and Soviet State policy thus became identical with world Communist policy. 9. This initially defensive strategy did not preclude offensive action in the long run a^and, on behalf of the Soviet Union, Stalin accepted precise obligations in this respect: “ In the first place,” he wrote, “ the pro letariat of the victorious revolutionary country ' must do its utmost to develop, support and awaken the revolution in all other countries ’ (Lenin); secondly, the victorious proletariat of the one country ‘. . . . would rise against the remainder of the capitalist world, winning over to its cause the oppressed classes in other lands, inciting them to revolt against the capitalists and even, when needs must, having recourse to armed intervention against the exploiting classes and their States ’ (Lenin).” Stalin continued : ‘‘ Characteristically enough, such help on the part of the victorious country not only Chastens the victory of the proletariat in other lands, but, by the very fact of hastening this victory, it ensures the final victory of socialism in the first country where the proletarian revolution has triumphed.” (Leninism, page 215.) 10. The victory of the October Revolu tion in Russia, according to Lenin, marked the beginning of a new epoch, “ the epoch of the world revolution, an epoch full of conflicts and wars, of flow and ebb, of victories and defeats, an epoch which would, in the end, lead to the victory of the proletariat in the chief capitalist countries.” During that epoch the prin ciples of strategy would remain unchanged but tactics, meaning “ the determination of the line to be taken by the proletariat during a comparatively short period,” would vary. This distinction between strategy and tactics is of fundamental importance and explains such apparent 1 anomalies as the New Economic Policy, the policy of Communist co-operation in popu- 113—34 lar fronts, and even, in the Communist view, the Soviet-German Non-Aggressive Pact of 1939. Soviet Internal Policy, 1917-39 11. On the basis of Stalin’s general appreciation Soviet policy between the two world wars, while never losing sight of the ultimate goal of a world Communist society, concentrated on its intermediate objectives. In his report to the 18th Party Congress in 1939 in which he reviewed the past history of the Soviet Union, Stalin divided the period into two phases, the first from the October Revolution to the liquidation of the exploiting classes {i.e., to the end of N.E.P. and the collectivisation of agriculture), and the second from the liquidation of capi talist elements in town and country to the adoption of the new Constitution of 1936, by which time the Socialist economy was regarded as firmly established. 12. In the earlier period the Soviet State set itself three main tasks : (a) the suppression of the overthrown classes within the Soviet Union; (5) the safe guarding of the country against attacks from abroad; both actual and potential; and (c) the economic organisation and cul tural education of the masses (the latter term implying the conditioning of the people to accept the doctrines of Marxism- Leninism). The third of these tasks was somewhat neglected in practice because the State was primarily preoccupied in defending its own existence and achieving a sufficient degree of economic reconstruc tion to press forward to the introduction of a Socialist economy. 13. In the second phase the tasks were (a) to organise a Socialist economy through out the country and to liquidate the last remnants of capitalism; (b) to organise a modern army for national defence; and (c) to organise the “ cultural ” revolution. The changes in these functions of the State are significant. The task of suppressing hostile classes had now dwindled to that of protecting established Socialist property from thieves and swindlers; the function of national defence was conserved to the full, z.e., the armed forces were maintained and developed, as were the punitive and intelli gence organs required to counter the danger from, as Stalin put it, “spies and wreckers continually being sent into the country by foreign intelligence agencies ”; while the task of economic and cultural organisation had become much more important. In short, the State had achieved a sufficient degree of consolidation to feel that it was in a position to move forward. c*4 14. In 1939 Stalin announced that the Soviet State had achieved the construction of socialism in one country. But, he pointed out, it still had to go on to the achievement of communism. (In the event, of course, further development along these lines was prevented by the war.) Soviet Foreign Policy, 1917-39 15. The functions of Soviet foreign policy between 1917 and 1939 were closely interlocked with those of internal policy. The messianic purpose of blazing the trail for and constantly advancing the world wide Communist Society was never lost sight of, but equally, after the first flush of success had waned, it was never forgotten that the first essential to that end was to ensure the continued existence, consolida tion and strengthening of the one Socialist State. That one State’s collapse would have involved not only itself but the whole cause of world revolution. Therefore, when the period of intervention had ended, the first move of the Soviet Government was to con clude a number of bilateral treaties and trade agreements, all designed to give the weak new regime a sorely needed breathing- space in which to acquire strength. The most effective move in this direction, how ever, was the proclamation in 1924, when a certain temporary stabilisation of the capitalist world had taken place and the expectation of immediate universal revolu tion had faded, of the doctrine of “ social ism in one country.” This slogan went far towards persuading the outside world that the theory of universal revolution had been discarded and that the Soviet Union might, at best, take a normal part in international collaboration or, at worst, concentrate on its own vast tasks of reconstruction and development, even though remaining aloof from the rest of the world. The pronounce ments of the most responsible Soviet authorities at the time contradicted these conclusions (see paragraph 9) and further evidence against them was provided by the existence and activities of the Comintern which from time to time did indeed directly handicap the Soviet Government in its striving for relations with the West which would be entirely free from dangerous complications {e.g., vis-a-vis the United Kingdom in 1927). 16. There was in fact a befogging duality of principle in the Soviet theory of foreign relations and a peculiar corresponding duality in Soviet foreign policy in practice. On the one hand, the Soviet rulers were pledged by all the canons of Marx, Lenin and Stalin to the basic aim of a world dictatorship of the proletariat; this implied an implacable enmity towards every form of bourgeois Government. On the other hand, since the biggest set-back that that aim could suffer would have been the overwhelming of the Socialist State from outside, the Soviet Union was unable to attempt to further it by an offensive policy so long as such a policy entailed any risk of disaster. However, the All-Union Com munist Party, which was de facto the Soviet Government, did not regard foreign rela tions as solely the relations between sovereign States represented by their re spective Governments. In the Marxist view the peoples of the world are not sec tioned off into purely geographical or national communities whose aspirations are, or can be, expressed by their Govern ments; the real division of the peoples of ^ the world is the supra-national class ^ division, the division between the bour geoisie and the proletariat, the rulers and the ruled, and the Communist Soviet Government has always in practice arro gated to itself the right to maintain liaison with and even speak for the proletariat of the whole world. The vanguard of the proletariat are, of course, the National Communist Parties with which the Soviet State has maintained a permanent alliance based on a literal identity of interests. 17. The result of this dual foreign policy was that stable alliances with foreign Governments were impossible and any pacts concluded by the Soviet Union could be no more than tactical manoeuvres. It meant, in fact, that the Soviet Government was able simultaneously to pursue defensive and ^ aggressive aims; the former in its formal &gt; dealings with other Governments, and the latter through its alliance with all prole tariats aiming at the overthrow of capitalism. Both these courses were, of course, appropriately modified according to the “ebbs and flows” which Lenin had predicted for the epoch following the October revolution (see paragraph 10). 18. The defensive line of Soviet policy was accentuated after Hitler’s advent to power, when the Soviet Union found itself menaced from both West and East. From then on Soviet policy concentrated on the quest for collective security (the U.S.S.R. entered the League of Nations, described in the Comintern programme of 1928 as “ the counter-revolutionary Holy Alliance of Imperialist Powers ”), mutual aid pacts (e.g., with France and Czechoslovakia) and the advocacy of drastic disarmament. In 1939, still with the same object, the Kremlin5 turned about and concluded the Non- Aggression Pact with Germany; but all these efforts to maintain the Soviet Union in safe isolation ended in failure with the German invasion in 1941. The Great Patriotic War 19. In Soviet eyes the second world war was the first of those clashes with the capitalist world which Lenin had predicted. It brought to the Soviet Union four years of desperate struggle for survival, during which many of the fundamental principles of Leninism had to be discarded, at least temporarily, for immediate advantage; and it ended in a victory which left the Soviet State, though badly mauled, as one of the only two giant Powers in the post-war world. Soviet policy in the past three years has developed against the background of these two facts and, as was pointed out in paragraph 1, its makers have chosen to steer their course by the orthodox ideology. Soviet Internal Policy since the War 20. The period of the “ patriotic war ” brought almost as much spiritual as material damage to Soviet progress along the Marxist-Leninist path. The alliance with the Western democracies, with the concomitant temporary abandonment of Marxist exclusiveness, the return of the old Russian patriotism in its full vigour, the prestige enjoyed by the armed forces to the detriment of the party, the increased tolerance towards the Orthodox Church— these enforced concessions to human nature gave rise to all manner of political and literary heresies and to the hope that after the war the Soviet Union would take its place as a normal member of the comity of nations, that longed-for political liberties would be finally restored, and that the sacrificing of generations of Soviet citizens in the name of remote and chimerical ideals would come to an end. Many people, both within and without the Soviet Union, even contrived to view the country’s entire past revolutionary history in the hopeful light of a praiseworthy battle for national development and survival. It is now clear, however, that the history of the Soviet Union during the patriotic war must be regarded as a temporary anomaly, chiefly significant in that it shows up the pro found difference between the aspirations of the Communist Party and those of the Russian people and affords a glimpse of the spiritual opposition with which the proponents of Marxism-Leninism have to contend. 21. In the international field the Soviet Union emerged from the war immensely 113—34 strengthened; internally, on the other hand, the regime found itself weakened to an alarming extent. Apart from purely economic deterioration—which, when war time development to the east and south of the Urals is taken into consideration, may prove to have been by no means as disastrous as has been generally assumed— serious rifts appeared in the country’s political structure. Although the Com munist Party had remained in unshakable control throughout the blackest period of the war, a marked ideological deterioration had set in which, if allowed to continue unchecked, would have led to wholesale abandonment of Communist principles and even, in consequence of this, to the end of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Communist Party itself, which had increased its membership to over 6 million, of which number over 60 per cent, were admitted during the war and were politically uneducated, was in danger of becoming little more than an association of Soviet patriots; large numbers of Soviet citizens had had contact with the West and had compared what they saw there with material conditions in the Soviet Union to the great disadvantage of the latter; the alliance between the Soviet Union and the Western democracies had temporarily reversed the campaign of vilification of the bourgeois West; the swift somersault involved in the Soviet- German Pact of 1939 was not without its psychological aftermath of uneasy doubt ing; and finally the readmission before the war of Russian patriotism and historical pride, and its large-scale harnessing during the war, had undone much of the £C cultural” (i.e., ideological) conditioning of the Soviet people achieved prior to 1939. 22. Such were the psychological com plexities confronting the Soviet authorities in addition to the comparatively straight forward problem of making good the material ravages of the war. They could, of course, have simplified this latter task infinitely by allowing the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism to sink into gradual oblivion, by concentrating on economic reconstruction and by allowing the Soviet Union to assume that place in the comity of nations which the rest of the world was only to willing to grant her. That this was not the course which the Soviet leaders had chosen to follow became apparent in January 1946, when, in an address on the 22nd anniversary of Lenin’s death, Alek sandrov, then head of the Central Com mittee’s Propaganda and Agitation Direc torate, officially revived the slogan of com munism as the party’s ultimate goal, a c* 26 slogan which was reiterated in the Central Committee’s election appeal of 2nd February. 23. It is perhaps appropriate at this point to indicate briefly what the Soviet leaders understand by the development from socialism to communism. The dis tinction between these two forms of society was defined by Stalin in the address he gave at the first All-Union Congress of Stakhanovites in 1935 and his analysis has been closely adhered to by all subse quent Soviet writers on the subject. The basic principle of the Socialist society, Stalin said, is that every member of it works according to his ability and receives the products of industry and agriculture according to the value of his work to the community; in practice this means that the cultural and technical level of the working class is still low' and that the distinction between mental and physical work con tinues to exist, since the productivity of labour is not yet high enough to assure an abundance of goods. Communism is a higher phase of development than socialism. The basic principle of the Com munist society is that every member of it works according to his ability and receives the products of industry and agriculture according to his needs as a culturally developed person. This postulates that the productivity of labour shall have risen sufficiently to guarantee an abundance of goods and that the cultural and technical level of the working class has become high enough to obliterate the distinction between mental and physical work. 24. According to Marxism the State apparatus (the armed forces, organs of enforcement, intelligence, security, &amp;c.) has no function to perform when communism has been attained, and therefore withers away. At the 18th Party Congress in 1939 Stalin was careful to point out that this could only be the case if the existing capitalist encirclement of the Soviet Union were replaced by a Socialist encirclement. The State apparatus would be conserved, he said, “if the danger of military attack from abroad is not removed, it being under stood that the forms taken by our State apparatus will be altered in conformity with alterations in internal and external circumstances.” This means in effect that the Soviet State will continue to exist until such time as the world Communist society has been achieved. 25. The party’s post-war drive for ideological revival began to develop in earnest in May 1946, when the party journal Bolshevik heralded the new move ment in an article demanding that the remnants of capitalism be expunged from people’s minds and that the Soviet press extol and propagate the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism. The same article significantly stressed the part to be played by literature and the arts in achieving the Communist society. The following month the periodical Culture and Life was founded to co-ordinate the propagation of the doctrines of communism through the cultural media. Its first number reaffirmed that the Soviet people were now confronted with the task of perfecting socialism and beginning the transition to communism, which would demand heroic efforts on the part of all Soviet citizens; the press was therefore exhorted to launch a high- powered campaign to train people in a Socialist attitude to work and to combat obsolete ideology, lack of discipline and culture, laziness, bureaucracy and careless- ^ ness and, at the same time, to exercise the^. utmost vigilance in guarding the State interests of the Soviet Union and in exposing warmongers and “ imperialist practices carried on under the banner of concern for democracy and order.” The next development was the ideological “ purge ” of the literary and artistic world which began in August 1946 when the Central Committee of the party attacked two Leningrad journals and the literary world in general for having per mitted Soviet literature to sink into the slough of non-political writing, counter revolutionary “ idealism ” and doctrines of the art-for-art’s-sake type. The cam paign for artistic purification spread rapidly to the theatre and the cinema, the defections of which were the subject of ^ specific fulminations from the party’s _&gt; Central Committee in August and Septem ber, and by the end of the year Soviet arts and letters had been brought back into line and harnessed to the requirements of the State. Henceforth, it was made evident, their purpose was to be to help on the fourth and subsequent five-year plans and at the same time to glorify the Soviet State, its strength, its achievements, and its immeasurable superiority to the rest of the world. 26. By the end of 1946 it had become fairly clear that the party leaders had never for one moment relinquished their ideal of achieving communism throughout the world. The immediate means to this end remained the traditional Stalinist method of consolidating socialism in the Soviet Union and of building up its politi cal, economic and military might. By this time, too, the pre-war spectre of a hostile “capitalist encirclement” had been7 successfully restored to its place in the forefront of Soviet propaganda and emo tionally much heightened by a skilful identification of the obnoxious concepts of fascism and racialism with “ bourgeois ideology ' ’ in general. 27. The year 1947 saw the development of a ponderous propaganda campaign for the reconditioning of the Soviet people. It was explained to them over and over again that the Soviet Union was in transi tion from socialism to communism and that this development was taking place in conditions of hostile bourgeois encircle ment, with the protagonists of reaction watching carefully for every opportunity of destroying the Socialist State. From this it followed that every Soviet citizen would not only have to toil self-sacrificingly in order to make good the ravages of the Jfcwar and to increase the country’s economic wealth sufficiently to achieve the Com- ^munist society, but that he would also have to labour to increase the country’s military might and be constantly on the watch for enemy infiltration ranging from ideological pressure to outright espionage. This dual motivation was synthesised in the concept of “ Soviet Patriotism,” which formed the background of the internal propaganda of the year. 28. The summer of 1947 saw the forma tion of the All-Union Society for the Dis semination of Political and Scientific Knowledge, a vast organisation for the co ordination of propaganda among the Soviet masses whose enthusiastic co-operation rather than docile acquiescence was obviously essential to the success of the ^Communist Party’s projects. The 'society’s published aims were (a) to develop a Socialist awareness in the masses, (b) to explain to them Soviet foreign and inter nal policy, (c) to inculcate Soviet pride, (d) to acquaint them with the principles of science, and (e) to combat anti-scientific views and remnants of alien ideology. This jargon simply meant that the society’s tasks were to persuade the masses to work harder and not to seek enrichment by the various illegal means which are notorious in Soviet reality, to propagate the official doctrine of the ever-present danger of aggression from the Western Powers, and thus justify all the Soviet Union’s actions in foreign and domestic affairs, to root out the average citizen’s ingrained suspicion that life is easier and better abroad, and replace it with an uninhibited Soviet chau vinism, to raise the low standards of tech nical efficiency and to discourage any religious beliefs or respect for ideas which have not been officially approved. 29. With this machinery for mass con ditioning in action the Soviet authorities next turned their attention to the “ pro fessional ” class of the intelligentsia, i.e., the engineers, office workers, civil servants, teachers and academic workers, and the vast body of the bureaucracy in its entirety, on which the Soviet authority really rests and which has swollen so enormously under Stalin in at least partial contradiction of Lenin’s policy and ideas. (In practice the workers and peasants have long since become mere adjuncts to the country’s material resources, although the question of their proper exploitation and control cannot be ignored, and is indeed, as shown above, receiving due attention). It is not overlooked that the Kussian intelligentsia inherits a tradition of progressive inde pendent thought and that, much as the party is striving to harness that tradition to its own ends, there is at least the possi bility that with improving material condi tions it might try to reassert itself. It is true that the class has considerable vested interest in the continuation of the State apparatus in its present form, but if it is to play its part as the conservative back bone of Soviet power, it must be completely dependent, completely dependable and com pletely orthodox. For that reason it is the main target for the party’s propaganda and campaigns for ideological purity. 30. The first important move in bringing Soviet thought back into orthodox party channels after the laxiety of the war period was made in the summer of 1947, when Zhdanov at tacked contemporary Soviet philosophy. The chief victim of the readjustment was no less a person than G. Aleksandrov who lost his position as the party’s propaganda chief for having shown excessive “ objec tivity ’ ’ towards non-Marxist philosophical systems. Later in the year Varga, the party’s star economist, was arraigned for the same attitude towards Western econo mics, and Rubinstein for being insuffi ciently critical of Western psychology. Also, in the summer of 1947, the formerly innocuous journal Literary Gazette was transformed into a militant organ devoted, as it announced, to “ the propaganda of Soviet Socialist culture and its growing world significance, the unmasking of re actionary bourgeois culture, the affirmation of Soviet patriotism, the battle against admiration for things foreign, and the demonstration of the superiority of Soviet democracy over false bourgeois demo cracy.” The violence of its tirades left the intelligentsia in no doubt about the utter impossibility of divorcing itself from the8 * Soviet Union’s crusade for communism. In January 1948 came a drive for the re valuation of Russian classical literature, the purpose of which was to point out that the works of even the best Russian writers of the past contained certain “ internal contradictions '' and were not without out worn ideas and sentiments alien to the spirit of Soviet man. Finally, the recent purge ’ ’ of outstanding Soviet composers completed the process of hermetically sealing oh all Soviet intellectual life from the West and imposing party directives as the only basis for creative activity. 31. This re-dedication of Soviet thought is the post-war background against which the pronouncements of Zhdanov, Malenkov and Molotov in the last part of 1947 must be read. Malenkov, in particular, summed up and explained the entire process of the return to Communist orthodoxy in his speech at the Cominform foundation meeting in Poland. The war, he said, had left certain weaknesses in the Soviet State and the Communist Party and ideology and organisational standards had declined. He also drew attention to the “ survival of bourgeois thinking” among the Soviet intelligentsia and to the need to press on with the inculcation of Soviet patriotism, to eradicate subservience to foreign ideas, to emphasise Soviet vigilance, and so to increase production as to make the Soviet Union militarily and economically strong enough to face any crisis. Molotov, in his address on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the October revolution, said that the third period of Soviet development had now begun. He, too, pointed to the tenacity of “capitalist survivals” in the Soviet Union, but added that there were now “ vast opportunities to conduct the struggle for the elimination of these survivals with success.” 32. To-day, then, the Soviet policy makers have gone far towards trans forming the Soviet Union into a rigidly controlled community in which all economic, intellectual and emotional forces are canalised in the service of the Party-State. In the process they are not above utilising the natural emotions of their peoples even when those feelings are in direct conflict with Marxist teachings. The most flagrant example of this is the pandering to Russian nationalism, the strength of which became strikingly apparent in the course of the war. The lesson having been duly absorbed, the party leaders have continued to turn this non-Marxist spiritual force to their own use while at the same time trying to reconcile it with official doctrines. The feat of squaring this particular circle is accomplished by the concept of Soviet patriotism. Soviet patriotism is patriotism of a higher type ” ; its essence is loyalty to the Soviet ideal and thus, unlike ordinary patriotism, it is subject to no limitations of country, race or creed, so that, in theory, there is no reason why Poles, Serbs, Roumanians or Englishmen, if sufficiently purified of bourgeois instincts, should not subscribe to it. It thus retains the dynamic of the German Herrenvolk theory, while skilfully avoiding the latter’s antagonising exclusiveness. The same opportunism is shown in the exploitation of religion and Slavism. The Russian Orthodox Church is allowed to function because, apart from the support it gives to the regime inside the Soviet Union, it can and does reach out into other Ortho dox fields, combat hostile religious forces^ such as Roman Catholicism, and enhance the prestige and influence of Moscow in the spiritual realm. The All-Slav movement also serves an obvious immediate tactical purpose in Eastern Europe, although in this case, in view of its dangerous exclu siveness, it is not to be expected that it will ever be given more than a secondary role. 33. In actual fact, now that the achieve ment of communism has become an affair of the Soviet State, the part to be played by each Soviet citizen has dwindled to working to strengthen the State in every way and to following blindly the instruc tions of his superiors. In the two and a half years since the end of the war, the Soviet leaders have accurately assessed the discrepancies between Soviet post-war reality and the path of development^ mapped out by Stalin at the 18th Party Congress, and they have applied with ruth less consistency the correctives necessary to force the Soviet people back on to that path. The short period of limited contact with other ideas and of the resurgence of traditional Russian ideals is now over and further developments within the Soviet Union, as long as the present phase lasts, can only be in the direction of sundering what minor connexions may still exist with the capitalist world, of concentrating all forces on the preservation of the Soviet myth in its entirety, and so strengthening the material might of the Soviet community that all other communities will be con strained to succumb to it. Soviet Foreign Policy since the War 34. It has been reiterated countless times by Soviet spokesmen and propagandists that a fundamental change occurred in the9 * A t- balance of world forces as a result of the war. The status and prestige of the Soviet union were immeasurably enhanced in the international field and the ranks of its faithful allies and instruments, the national Communist parties, had swollen enormously; while, by Soviet calculations, the capitalist system, including the United States, was moving rapidly and inescapably towards its next profound cyclical crisis— a crisis which had begun in 1937 but the full operation of which had been artificially and temporarily averted by the war. In these circumstances it was clearly possible to strengthen the security of the Soviet base of world revolution externally as well as internally. If the aim underlying the slogan “Socialism in one country” was, as Stalin asserted in 1925, “ the consolida tion of the dictatorship of the proletariat one country where it could be used as a fulcrum for the overthrow of imperialism ^tn all countries ” (Leninism, p. 148), the time had surely come to lay the emphasis on the Soviet Union’s role as the cc fulcrum.” 35. The first step in the execution of this post-war strategy was to seep into the vacuum left in Eastern Europe by the war. This was accomplished by territorial exten sion of the U.S.S.R. and the methodical installation of docile satellite Governments in the countries over which the Red army flowed in the wake of the defeated Germans. (The facts that trained Com munist cadres were held in storage in Moscow for this purpose and, incidentally, that spying activities against the Allies were in progress at least as early as 1942, as shown in the Royal Commission’s Report on the Canadian Spy Case, reinforce the ^^rgument that the Soviet Government at no time abandoned the aim of world revolu tion.) This process is commonly called the establishment of the Soviet Union’s Western security belt, but it represented at the same time an extension of the “ Socialist bridge-head ” and a direct political, economic and military strengthening of the Soviet base in the form of additional man-power, raw materials and industrial potential, not to mention useful support and votes at inter national conferences and in international organisations. 36. The Soviet Union's attitude with regard to international organisations has been strictly logical. She entered such bodies as were likely to further Soviet aims and refused to participate in organisations or on terms which might require conces sions from her. Thus, Soviet representa tion in the United Nations afforded a useful platform for propaganda and opportunity for impeding co-operative projects bene ficial to the capitalist countries, while the veto provision in the Security Council gave a sure guarantee that no measures could be adopted which might conceivably interfere with Soviet designs. From U.N.R.R.A. the Western Republics of the U.S.S.R. drew considerable material benefit, but member ship of such bodies as the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation and U.N.E.S.C.O. offered no tangible advantage and was therefore declined. The principle followed by Moscow in these questions was to co-operate only in such cases where the aims of Soviet policy could be directly advanced and its interests defended, where there was no risk of being forced to accept obligations which might hamper the execution of the basic strategy, and where there was a possibility of blocking the purposes of the capitalist States. 37. In the first two years following the war there was no vital urgency apparent in Soviet policy. The strategy designed to advance the world revolution was systematically implemented through the pressure of the Soviet Government in all international relations, through the now impressive influence of the national Com munist parties and through propaganda. Looming steadily nearer, moreover, was the inevitable economic crisis which would con vulse the United States, paralyse Western Europe and produce the revolutionary situation, which, in the Soviet apprecia tion, seemed to be round the corner. Mean while, there was a good deal of cleaning up, consolidation, conditioning and reconstruc tion to be done in the Soviet Union itself and in the satellite States, and preparations made for the exploitation of the revolu tionary situation when it arrived. With the enunciation of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, however, Soviet policy swiftly became more positive, more dynamic and more open. 38. According to Stalin’s economists, a deep economic crisis is due in the United States and the countries of Western Europe in the very near future. In the United States it will be a crisis of over-production, as a result of which American imperialism will become even more naked, and in the Western European countries it will be a crisis of under-production due to lack of purchasing power to acquire essential raw materials. In both cases the crisis will lead to large-scale unemployment, reduced standards of living for the masses, intensi fication of the battle for world markets and increased militarisation. It was for these10 t developments that the Soviet Union could afford to wait in the confident expectation that they would culminate in a true revolu tionary situation in the course of which there would be a considerable possibility of the respective proletariats seizing power and thus carrying the world revolution a huge stride forward. The Marshall Plan caused a rude awakening because it raised the possibility that the crisis of the capi talist world might in actual fact be at least deferred, thus knocking the bottom out of Soviet calculations as far as the immediate future is concerned. These fears had to be seriously entertained because some such development had been foreseen by the leading economist, Varga, who had fallen into disfavour in consequence, in his book, “ Changes in Capitalist Economy as a Result of the Second World War.' Varga had suggested that war-time Government control over national economies in the capitalist States would be continued in the post-war period and thus defer the opera tion of the inevitable crisis for possibly ten years. The European Recovery Pro gramme is precisely that type of Govern ment action, and however much Soviet propaganda may protest and Rowever much the plan may be denounced as American imperialism, the fear must, nevertheless, be present in the minds of the Soviet leaders that common action by the Governments of the capitalist States might prevent the advent of the Marxist crisis in the imme diate future and even lead to long-term stabilisation of the capitalist world. 39. The concrete expression of the Soviet reaction to the European Recovery Pro gramme was the creation of the Cominform, the purpose of which officially was the exchange of information between the nine Communist Parties represented in it and the co-ordination of action by them in case of necessity. Its function was to resist imperialist aggression in the shape of the alleged United States policy of economic expansion and to work for a democratic peace and the liberation of oppressed peoples—the word ‘ £ democratic ’ ’ meaning, by Soviet interpretation, “ safe for the dictatorship of, the proletariat.” The challenging manner in which the creation of the new organisation was proclaimed was also designed to retain on the Soviet side the initiative on which such great store is set in Communist strategy. 40. The post-war disposition of world forces, as seen by Moscow, was clearly stated by Zhdanov at the Cominform meeting of September 1947. As long ago as 1925 Stalin had enunciated that &lt;c the world has been divided into two camps, the imperialist camp and the anti-imperialist camp The two most important capi talist countries, Britain and the United States, present themselves as an Anglo- American alliance leading the other capi talist countries. On the other hand, at the head of the various countries which are dis satisfied with imperialism and carry on a life-and-death struggle with it is our country, the Soviet Union.” Zhdanov took precisely the same starting-point in 1947. The relative strength of the two camps, he pointed out, had, however, radi cally altered. The imperialist camp had lost three of its six major Powers—Ger many, Japan and Italy—-as a result of the war; the new democracies of Eastern Europe had transferred to the rival group ing; France had ceased to be a Great Power and Britain was greatly weakened; only the / '' N Pnited States remained unimpaired and^ indeed strengthened. In addition, the' peoples of the colonial and dependent coun tries were clamouring for liberation, the aspirations of the proletariats of the capitalist countries were being ruthlessly suppressed, and serious antagonisms were active in the relations between the capitalist States themselves. In other words, the three contradictions inherent in capitalism (see paragraph 5) were at play. The anti imperialist camp, on the other hand, had enjoyed a great accession of strength. It had recruited the “ new democracies,” the strength of local Communist Parties had grown enormously and the prestige of the Soviet Union had made it more than ever a rallying-point and beacon of hope for all oppressed peoples. 41. The actual order of battle drawn up ^ by Zhdanov was as follows. The impe rialist camp consists of the United States supported by Britain and France; by Belgium and Holland, as imperialist countries; by Turkey and Greece, as reactionary countries; and by the countries of the Middle East, South America and China, as political or economic dependants of the United States. The ‘ ‘ democratic ’ ’ group contains the U.S.S.R. and the new democracies, and Roumania, Hungary and Finland, which have broken with imperialism; Indonesia and Viet-Nam are “ adherents ” and [ndia, Egypt and Syria C£ sympathisers ”, while the workers and the democratic move ment throughout the world, the various Communist Parties and the national liberation movements in exploited terri tories are also among the supporters of the anti-imperialist camp.11 42. Malenkov, also at the Cominform foundation meeting, summarised the Soviet appreciation of the post-war position, when he said that “ the centre of the class struggle has shifted to the international arena.” He then went on to describe the methods which the All-Union Communist Party was adopting to meet the situation. Soviet policy, he asserted, was directed towards “undermining imperialism”; it would continue to unmask all the enemies of peace and resist attempts to ‘ £ ignore the democratic camp or minimise its signifi cance, to sow intrigues against it or form hostile blocs and groups.” Soviet diplo macy was to be entrusted only to selected cadres capable of ensuring that the party line was followed in foreign policy and it would be assisted in its work by the “moral-political, ideological and cultural ^ links between the U.S.S.R. and working- class and progressive circles abroad ” ^ which had been forged during or as a result of the war. This statement amounted to an assertion that the Soviet Union would utilise for its own purposes organisations such as the trade union, youth and women’s movements, and the various Soviet Friend ship Societies abroad. Proof of the success of this line was afforded in the recent coup in Czechoslovakia, where the Communist- dominated trade union organisation played as important a role as the police force in ensuring the Communist victory. 43. In practice the Cominform Declara tion, despite its presentation of capitalism in the guise of aggressor, was an announce ment that the Soviet camp was going on to the offensive, that the national Communist Parties represented in the new organisation ,Awere to be controlled by Moscow on a tighter rein, and that the strategy and tactics of Leninism were to be followed more strictly than previously. The strike action organised by the French Communist Party in the autumn of 1947 was an example of the new line in action. It was almost certainly dictated from Moscow and contrary to the judgment of the local Communist Party. It was designed to nullify Marshall aid to France in advance by creating economic chaos and, by dis crediting the “ Third Force ” in France, to lead to a situation in which Frenchmen would have to choose between de Gaulle, painted as black reaction, on the one hand, and the Communists as the defenders of democracy and progress, on the other. In the second respect at any rate the plan failed in its object, thus suggesting that the Stalin technique is most likely to blunder when provoked into hasty counteraction. The Rome strike in December last was also an abortive move, and the Markos Junta has yet to prove its worth to the revolutionary cause. The recent developments in Czecho slovakia, on the other hand, were an example of Stalinist tactics perfectly executed and calculated to establish the initiative once more on the Soviet side. 44. Another Soviet reaction to the European Recovery Programme was the accelerated tempo at which the Soviet Government rushed through its political and economic pacts with satellite States. The ultimate aim here is to achieve a perfectly integrated political, economic' and military system of the east European States and the Soviet Union, capable of being wielded as a single instrument of Soviet policy. Conclusion 45. The long-term policy of the Soviet Union has always been based on the un shakable dogma that capitalism is doomed and has entered its final stage before dis solution. The Soviet Union, as the base of expanding Marxist socialism, has accepted the obligation to work by all possible means for the overthrow of capitalism everywhere and its replacement by the dictatorship of the proletariat as the preparatory phase preceding the advent of a world Socialist society. On principle, however, the Soviet Government has never in the past been pre pared to expose the Soviet State, and thus the entire Marxist aspiration, to the risk of disaster. Although, since the last war, it is genuinely believed that there has been a vast swing of power in favour of the rising forces of communism and that the Capitalist system is greatly enfeebled, it is a reasonable assumption that the Soviet State as such will still be guided by that principle and that, in pursuit of the Com munist goal, the Soviet leaders will limit themselves to ‘ £ all means short of war ’ ’ so long as they believe that the outcome of a war would be uncertain, i.e., until they are confident that the strength controlled by the Soviet Union has far surpassed that of the United States. 46. The several assertions of Stalin, Zhdanov, Molotov and other Soviet spokes men that Soviet foreign policy envisages the co-existence “for a long time' of the Capitalist and Socialist systems and that “ co-operation is therefore possible between them on terms of reciprocity and the ful filment of obligations undertaken,” cannot, however, be taken at their face-value. To be properly understood such statements must be considered in conjunction with Lenin’s more candid dictum, reaffirmed by12 Stalin at the XIVth Party Congress, that “we are living not merely in one State but in a system of States, and it is incon ceivable that the Soviet Republic should continue to exist interminably side by side with imperialist States. Ultimately one or the other must conquer ' ’ (Leninism, page 234). This latter doctrine means in practice that war is ultimately inevitable between the Capitalist world and the Socialist world, unless the former allows itself to be swallowed up by the latter without opposition, and since the second alternative obviously cannot be prudently assumed Soviet policy must be to prepare by all possible means for the first. The professions of belief in the mutual com patibility of the two systems, which always contain loop-holes in the form of conditions, are part of the preparation for the harsher probability. They are calculated to lull suspicion and to throw the blame for failure to co-operate on other shoulders; and they cost nothing. In another apposite passage, also quoted with approval by Stalin (Leninism, page 22), Lenin showed plainly what the Soviet Communist regards as the only basis of international co-operation. “ In no circumstances,” he wrote, “ under no possible conditions can it (i.e. inter national imperialism) live at peace with the Soviet Republic .... Here is the greatest difficulty of the Russian Revolution, its supreme historical problem—the need to solve international problems, the need to promote the world revolution.' 47. There is no evidence in the history of the Soviet Union to support any hope that Soviet policy may forsake of its own volition or in the foreseeable future the basic principles laid down by Lenin and Stalin. From the point of view of the revo lutionary leaders still in power they have been vindicated by events and it would be folly to abandon them now for methods favoured by those whom they continue to regard as the enemy. Moreover, the future generation of Soviet leaders is being educated according to the same rigid principles and any sort of original thinking is denounced and ruthlessly stamped out as ^ heretical deviation. Whatever changes of personnel may occur, therefore, it is likely /** that the watchword of Stalin, already as safely canonised as Lenin, will still hold good. “ There can be no doubt,” he said, “ that as long as we remain faithful to this (?’.£., the Marxist-Leninist) doctrine, as long as we possess this compass, we shall be successful in our work.” -» i rs 14743 118—34</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000369_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/162</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000369</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/162</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 6/23 Communism (Including Soviet Broadcasts, Anti-Communistic Policy and Stalinism, etc)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1948/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-05-29T22:22:43</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (29 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 31; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains copies of anti-Communist publications and briefings that were produced by the Foreign Office and sent to British diplomatic posts throughout the Middle East including the Political Agency and Consulate in Muscat.
