U5'o You wlllhave already received a copy of Jedda telegram No«177 of the 87th December regaraing the oaudi-Kowelt Agreements. 2# It see is almost Impossible tv&gt; reach any agreement over Uj musabala , and it occurs to us that a solution might be to remove ^\n c\ » 'IbU all mention of musabala from the Agreements. Article 9 of the Trade Agreement Is not very satisfactory from the legal point of view since it confers no powers or rights on either side which they do not possess in an/ case. If the Sheikh of Koweit is willing to let tribesmea from iiaudl territory enter Kowelt terri tory for muaabala or for any other purpose without getting his permission beforehand, he can let them do so without a written agreement to this effect between himself and Ibn Gaud. Similarly, if Ibn .iaud wishes to say that his tribesmen must not leave iiaudi territory without a document issued by the baud! authorities, he is free to db so without any agreement with the sheikh. In practice, no doubt, Ibn Saud finds great difficulty in controlling Bedouin on the desert frontier and he wishes the Sheikh to do it for him. At any rate it setms that our best course now would be to b &gt; j fel^ try to get both sides to agree to the orals^ion of Article 9 of the „ ^ . tVd '-ni Traae Agreement and the words w or musabala * 1 in Article 9 of the Bon • h- Volslnage Agreement and the whole of Article 11(5) of that .Agreement. 3. As regards the exilistment of the nationals of one government in the armed forces of thfe other, there seems no difficulty about this and we suggest it would be best to omit Article 10 of the Bon Voislnage Agreement altogether. ^ ^ 4. As regards the list of tribes in Article 7 of the Schedule to the Bon Voisinage Agreement, we think- that it would be best for the Sheikh to make a list of the tribes whom he claims as his subjects, C0PY SENT BY AIR MAIL ls/ • Gibson, Seq, 0 f /O. &gt; '-fo (W Cup jtMJ' o* U .ft- ■ 2. 9^55- as suggested in paragraph 6 of Trott'ti telegram. 8. iVe also agree with Trott that the insertion of the words 'third Arab State' in Articles 1 and 2 of the Extradition Agreement shoula be a satisfactory solution. 6.

After ' t journey ,, insert ''and Kuwait authorities will inform Saudi Agent in Kuwait of names and tribes of persons arriving and of articles they carry away from Kuwait'. With regard to (b). Hafiz has agreed to omission. With regard to (d). Hafis agrees to suggested inser tion and with regard to foreigners not falling under terms of agreement resulting from insertion he suggests exchange of letters later through ordinary diplomatic channels. 3. Shaikh has agreed to all the above and Hafiz has sent message to Mng and expects confirmation tomorrow or next day. With regard to (c). Hafiz hopes that Mng / willwill agree to omisBion of list but has Jut following alternatives to him to either of which Shaikh will agree. Ul&gt;:' (i) Omit Article 7 of Schedule to -t^on Toisinage and h' m through an exchange of letters to arrange for a Joint connuission to meet in the future to settle tribal question or (2) add sentence saying that as Kuwait claims nationals in some of the above mentioned tribes ^omission 'but is not interested it is agreed to settle •♦in the othera*) matter in the future by a joint commission. 5. In Saudi draft frade Agreement first paragraph of Article 9 of that agreement has not been included but Hafiz has agreed to insertion of wording as proposed for Article n (5) of Bon Voismage Treaty, ^ur draft would also need amend ment if proposals are accepted • This seems necessary to qualify paragraph (2) of Article i of Trade Agreement. 6* i request immediate instructions. -POLITICAL. ^ # I JO (Copy sent to Govt.of India under JP.L.No.G/186 of 29/2/40).Telegram Cy* TPvom Political Agent, Kuwait.

Dated and received the 28th February 1940• URGEITT. - / Brief remarks on my telegram No.C/76 of 28th February are (a) Kuwait cannot object to Saudis imposing restrictions on their people and as regards our informing Saudi Agent here of purchases there seems no local objection. Kuwait soon after war broke out imposed regulations that all bedouins must obtain clearance papers from local authorities for exports so only new departure for Kuwait will be to inform Saudi Agent as regards Saudis, hafiz could not agree to total exclusion of Article. (b) and (d). Ho remarks. (c) Question of joint commission is of course new but Hafiz did not seem to think commission would materialize early, in any case Kuwait seems to have nothing to lose by a settlement, it appears that Bin Saud sets great store on list of tribes and v/ithout something on the above lines I doubt if we shall be able to (?omission) agreement# •POLITICAL. ¥.L 0 (Copy sent to Govt# of India under P.L.Ko*0/186 of 29/2/40).Telegram Cy.

(b) Ho comments. (c) It may be expected that Ibn Saud will not agree to total omission of list of tribes for all time and Hafiz's first alternative to which Shaikh agrees seems best solution. (d) Hafi^s suggestion for exchange of letters to cover foreigners of non-Arab States introduces wider implications which presumably will not bear consideration in present circumstances. -Resident.

On being informed by King's personal agent of establishment of this post the Political Agent, Kuwait, ? objected ( mut. ) His Ilaj- esty , s Government and Shaiich of Kuwait could not permit it. i Ibn Saud is at a lost to understand why he should not establish a customs post in the neutral zone; it is not he says contrary to intentions of Uquair protocol and he would have no objection to Shaikh establishing such a post. Moreover in agreement recently concluded with Iraq provision is made for establishment oy both parties of customs post in their neutral zone. King pressed me for earliest possible reply as he says matter is of urgent importance to him.

I enclose a copy of a telegrain from Jedda regarding the desire of Tbn Saud to estalolisli a customs post at Wafra in the middle of the Saudi-Koweit Keutral Zone. S, The agreement of the 3nd December 192B here called the Uqair Protocol says that in the neutral aone Tf the Cfovemments of Nejd and Koweit will share equal ^rights'. 1 do not know enough about the history of the zone to s ay whether any attempt has ever been made to provide for its joint control by the two parties, or whether aiiy control at all is exercised by anybody within its borders at the present time. But assuming that the wording of the Agreement of the 2£nd December is our sole guide, it seems to us that (a) While this wording does not preclude the establishment of a customs post by one party with the consent of the other, it may be regarded as precluding its establishment without the consent of the other, but (b) it cannot have been intended that there should be no authority exercised within the zone at all, if the practical need for the exercise of such authority were ever felt. 3. We feel therefore that an obligation must be assumed to rest on each of the parties to accept any reasonable suggestions made by the other for the joint control of the zone, or, failing that, not unreasonably or vexatiously to withhold consent to any reasonable measures of control instituted by the other, on the understanding that he himself is free to take parallel and simultaneous measures. 4. The question whether Ibn Saud's desire to have a customs post at Vvafra is in fact 'reasonable' is not one on which we would wish to dogmatise without fuller information as to the local JilLo topography. But we observe that one of the specified routes MO laid down in (or at least to be deduced from) Articles 1 and 7 of the Trade Agreement recently initialled at Koweit, i.e. that between Subaihiyah in southern Koweit and Al Qarya in north eastern Hasa, must almost certainly pass through the neutral zone. It is possible that Wafra is the only group of wells, either inside or outside the zone, from which this route and other routes leading from the zone into Saudi Arabia can be watched. 5. It is rather surprising that in the circumstances it should not have occurred to anyone, either here or in Saudi Arabia or Koweit, to deal with the neutral zone in the Trade Agreement. Article 1 (1) of the Agreement says that 'all goods which leave Koweit territory for Saudi Arabia' must be accompanied by a manifest, be carried in a caravan, etc. ut many of these goods probably leave Koweit territory for the neutral zone in the first place, even though their ultimate destination may be uaudi Arabia.

The establishment in the zone either of e joint customs post or else of separate Saudi and Koweit customs posts may be an eminently reasonable practical measure. But the results might be, from a legal point of view, that persons in the aone, whether residents or visitors, who would not, vti ila still in the zone, have comiaitted any offence against the law of Koweit by leaving Koweit without manifests etc., (or at least would not have done so so far as the Agreement is concerned - see, for instance, Article 4, which says nothing about the neutral sone) might find themselves apprehended ^ or intending to commit an offence against the Saudi State which would not and could not be actually committed until they reached the Saudi border and took goods into Saudi Arabian territory with out having fulfilled the formalities of the Trade Agreement. 7. It is possible that Ibn Saud has tumbled to the fact that any amount of goods might leave Koweit for ostensible destinations in the presumably thinly-populated neutral zone without any of the safeguards contained in the Trade Agreement being applicable, and might from there be smuggled into Saudi Arabia. There seems at first glance to be much to be said for his point of view and some sort of agreement on the subject seems eminently desirable. The only pity is Ibn Saud did net raise this question long before, instead of springing it on us like this at the last moment. i fc ■ i c i I 8. Incidentally, Article 8 of the Extradition Agreement is of interest in this connexion. It clearly contemplates that Saudi or Koweit officials may enter the zone and aj-prehend absconders from Saudi Arabia or Koweit. It also contemplates that fugitives from the zone may be dealt with in Saudi Arabia or Koweit. On the other hand it eajs nothing about dealing with persons who have committed offences in the zone #iile still within its borders. This point would not, however, be strictly relevant to an extradition agreement between the two parties having rights in the zone. 9.

He thinks that a fort would be the first step to upsetting the status quo in the Neutral Zone with the eventual object of opening up the way for oil exploitations. His Highness thinks that the request is only a cloak to hide the real intention. He states that there is water close to the southern boundary of the Neutral Zone in Saudi territory, and that Ibn Saud could establish a fort in that region. He adds that there is no trade route through the Zone though odd camel caravans may pass that way. A number of tribesmen and herdsmen move south by this route. 3* With regard to anti-smuggling measure mentioned ^ b-btS in India Office telegram No.2175 Of the 6th May, 1940, I d) not think that a problem really exists.

For your own information, 3haikh , s main objection is his suspicion that Ibn Saudis real object is to undermine the status qu o in the neutral zone and force his hand over oil negotiations. 3. The Shaikh is very tenacions of his rights in the neutral zone and it would be very difficult to convince him that they would not be prejudiced by Saudi mut.) proposal. On the other hand ?on this point Uquair protocol is vague and you will see from Mr. Kyre^s letter of 29th April to India Office, that position is such that, in the absence of mutual agreement. His Majesty # s Government might have to advise the Shaikh to assent to Ibn 3aud f s proposal if, on further consideration, the V /necessi ty1 2« necsssity of proposal were clearly established and Shaikh's objections should appear unreasonable and vexatious.

If a person in Saudi Arabian territory is suspected of having brought in goods from Koweit in contravention of the Trade Agreement signed on the 1940 between the two Governments and escapes into Koweit territory, the competent authorities in Koweit,oi receipt of news thereof, shall arrest him and seize any goods in his possession.

(4) To His Majesty r s Minister at Jedda from the Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Monsieur le Ministre, I have received your note of today's date and take note of your assurance that it is the intention of the Government of the United Kingdom and of the Government of Koweit that the provisions of the Extradition Agreement concluded this day. and particularly the provisions of Article 3 (2; thereof, shall apply equally whether the person committing an offence for which extradition is demanded is a Badu or not. On behalf of the Government of Saudi Arabia I hereby assure you that it is the intention of ths Government of Saudi Arabia also to interpret the Agreement in this way.■^■1 ■ 1504/22?/25). I have discussed the two new notes with Mr, Baggallay and understand that so far as can Toe judged the intention of the negotiators is bo separate the question of the tribes from the Schedule to the Bon Voisinage Agreement, and that the general purpose of the notes is to decide wiiich tribes or sections of tribes are dependent upon Saudi Arabia and upon Koweit respectively. The first thing that strikes one about the notes therefore is that there is no list of Koweit tribes. Secondly the notes speak of determining the nationality, of elements (i.e. presumably tribal groups or sections) when really something like 'tribal dependenGe ,, is meant, our conception of nationality being something which affects the individual, A third point is that it is not clear whether the arrangements to settle this question are to be made direct between Saudi Arabia and Koweit or through His Majesty's Government. , Li I have made tentative amendments in both ^otes to meet the first two points, and as regards the third I have Inserted provisionally the Saudi and Koweiti Governments, One further point occurs to one in connexion with the Bon Voisinage Agreement and Schedule. There is not so far as I can see anything*in the Agreement to link it with the Schedule, although it seems perfectly clear that the latter is intended to serve as a guide to the Frontier Officers in carrying out their duties under the Agreement, I find some difficulty in selecting a suitable place for inserting the necessary link, but it would suffice for the purpose if, in Article 3 (l) of the Agreement, after the words 'application of the provisions w of this Agreement'the words 'in accordance with the annexed 'Schedule' were inserted# * serve a casual reference in Article 11 (4).I.Z.2790/4-0.

Dated 2nd received 3rd December 1940. ..pi*' .A S/0 d ; Ibn Saud attaches very great importance to My telegram No.277. maintenance of original wording of second exchange of letters annexed to Extradition Agreement. Intention was to say not that provision for Extradition Agreement applies equally to bedouin (please see note accompanying your despatch No.283 of November 2Srd 1939) but that only type of crime which a bedouin ever commits is a crime of violence which cannot be classed as a political offence. Ibn Saud ! s draft followed exactly the wording of exchange of letters annexed to the h Iraqi-Saudi Arabian Extradition Agreement and to adopt suggested re-draft would be to accord more favourable treat ment to bedouin of Kuwait tnan to those of Iraq. I pointed out that English text could hot be allowed to stand as wording was whatever the intention, offensive to bedouin. Yusuf Yasin finally agreed that if text of letter 3 remained in form of Saudi draft he would re-draft first and b. fSfq - ATO • second sentences of letter 4 in following sense: 'I agree that offences which bedouin usually commit fall within those specified in Article 3 of Extradition Agreement and that it would be incorrect to describe such offences as political'.

My comments are: 1 (a) S'rom this it can 'be surmized that Bin Saud is satisfied with the Agreement as seen after it has heen six months in force. Kuwait is also satisfied, therefore, there appears to he no objection to increasing the period to five years. I have not approached Shaikh who will agree with what we suggest, particularly if our suggestion coincides with Bin Saud's views. ('b) Addition of 'or of any.other purpose not specified in the article' is necessary to safeguard the free movement of herdsmen. 2 (a) Yusuf Yasin's views seem to 'be correct. (h) Yusuf Yasin's statement is correct, hut presumably s. 6. mfp— 1407 SiP—(M-2339)— 25-5-37 —300,000. 1 111 ' 'Io /atf ( terms of extradition agreement woull come into play 'before the surrendering of individuals. Minister*s correction is an added * precaution to which I think we can agree. (c) I doubt if the term ?&gt; A raihdar ' could 'be held to include all the Eashayida, the whole of which tribe the Shaikh claims. It is clear that Bin Saud would never agree to the Eashayida heing cut from his list, and inserted under Kuwait, and as there is no doubt that the whole tribe is not subject to Kuwait, 'but only elements as is the case with the Ajman etc. the insertion of the term 'A rai'bda r' under 'Tribes of Kuwait' will fully safeguard the Shaikh's interests. It is recognised here that no trihes are in origin Kuwaiti, 'but it is possible that all are not even Nejdi, therefore the note should 'be worded as settled previously, i.e. to decide which elements are Kuwaiti and not, as Yusuf Yasin points out, to decide also which are Nejdi. The omission of the words 'or Saudi Arabia respectively' in the foreign Office drafts should 'bring the note into line with 'Bin Saud's and the Shaikh's views and also meet the needs of correct diplomatic language. 3. foreign Office have excluded the letter which provided for negotiations concerning the extradition or foreigners other than Arah foreigners. His Majesty's Goverment agreed to hold the matter over for discussion at a later date. Some form of note is therefore necessary to cover the point. 4. If it is finally agreed that the Arabic text should prevail I hope we shall 'be given an opportunity to see a final Arabic draft before the signature copies are prepared.

Political Resident, Bushire. i \\l P Your telegram No.T/635 November 6th. Kuwait Saudi Agreements. 2. Shaikh has agreed to l(b), 2(a) (b) and 3 but not to 2(c). Shaikh has strongly pressed for ^ i rv v is exclusion of letters concerning tribal allegiance prefer- ing to leave question open. 3. These letters could not be acceptable to Shaikh in their present form. They show no tribes under heading ••Tribes of Kuwait* 1 and thus last paragraph of second letter implies that we on Shaikh's behalf agree that there are none. This is not true for we know Shaikh claims of major portion of Eashida and elements in other tribes. In the event of committee as visualised being appointed no provision has been made for arbitration when a deadlock occurs as occur it will ? An arbitrator there must be and one whose decision will not only be final but will be acceptable to bot/i parties. 4. 1 consider that no useful purpose can be served by retaining this exchange of letters and that they are in fact a potential source of friction between the two countries. I suggest such pressure as .nay be possible be exerted to induce Saudi Government to agree to exclusion of /i of letters. Should tribal trouble occur later then (iueetion can be reo B ened and an equitable solution sought.

' * n . is aware of the above position as is presumabl3 r the case and is not himself signing the agree- ments, I go not see why he should expect to receive signed copies. If however you really think that he will take serious offence if he is not given such copies, I am willing to recom mend to Plis Majesty's Government that this should be done, * As already pointed out it will not be possible to give him signed copies of the notes accompanying the agreements. 4, please see paragraph 4 of Prior's telegram T/150 March 2nd 1940. Galloway's letter to the Sheikh of March 4th 1940 omitted mention of the 'request to His Majesty's Government to conclude the agreements' and also implied a further formal communication. Would you see any difficulty now in making a formal communication on the lines indicated by Prior and would you expect to receive a satisfactory reply from the Sheikh? 5.

P.A reports tiiat the Shaikh is definitely opposed to the est^l ishment of a post 'by Bin Sa'ud at li are; - Wafra. His reason! (1) tnat there is no trade route through the neutral zone, though odd caravans pass that way; (2) that there is water close to the southern boundary of the Neutral Sone, in Sa'udi territory, where Bin 3a f ud could establish a post; and (5) that the establishment of a post at Wafra would be the first step by Bin Sa'ud to upsetting the status quo, with the eventual object of opening up way to oil negotiations. 2. P.A does not think that the ant i-smuggling measures of the Kuwait Agreement should be applied as he does not thinx that a problem exists. He says that all articles leaving Kuwait for Sa'udi Arabia do so on mani fests but he does not say if the manifest system is uded for articles leaving Kuwait for the Neutral Zone. 3. May the Shaikh's objections be communicated to the India Office reference their telegram at r-bb adding that with regard to the application of the anti- smjiggling measures of the Kuwait Agreement, P.A is Deing asked to report if the manifest system is used for goods^leaving Kuwait for the Neutral Zone. 4*. jOjut ' JY - I I V ^ % ^ ^ // r -. i f/tx a*-, ^ _ 5 7. c//| A.

U /^c The Jedda draft of the^/Bon Voislnage Agreement dis cussed with the Saudi Govt. (Vol.D.143 p.163) did not list the Saudi or Kuwait tribes. As a result of the discussion the Saudi Govt, inserted as Article 7 (D.150 p.62) a list of the tribes they claimed as theirs and asked that a list of the Kuwait tribes should be added (ibid p.45). The Shaikh of Kuwait objected to this (ibid p.97 para.2 (b), p.98 para.3 (b) &amp; p.129 para#6 (iii)jfand the Foreign Office suggested its omission (ibid p.149 para.3). Minister Jedda suggested that the Shaikh should make a list of those bedouin who were by common consent Kuwaitis (ibid p#152 para.6) and the India Office endorsed this suggestion (ibid p.211 para.2 (c)). The Shaikh wished to keep the question fluid (p.9 corr.) but in discussions with Hafiz Wahba at Kuwait which followed shortly after agreed to an exchange of letters (p.2o corr.para.4 and pp.42-3 corr.). Reference to corr.relating to certain changes in the text of the letters is given in para.3 of^ note of 19.12.41 at N-p.21. h 11 31.3.42. * S. v !&gt; 5 3/^^ I should be grateful if C*A«could comment on S.63 and refer me to any precedents liy own opinion is i^olinett-4er-tre that who are responsible for conducting the foreign affairs of Kuwait are one of the parties to the Agreement and not the bhaikh. It will be noted - vide pp# 142-46 etc., that the ^isru Agreements haite-JBtg^w signed M for the (iovernment of the united Kingdom M and not H for the ahaikh of Jtuwait 11 . ttJUic 13-4.42- The correspondence regarding the Bahrain Transit Dues agreement which appears to be the closest parallel is not on tour so I cannot say whether signed copies were in that case given to the Bahrain Government; I think not. Our position at Kuwait however, is not as strong as that at Bahrain cf. enclosure to D.O. letter No•PZ.7459/36 dated 29 -10—36, and while it is true that the agreements are to be signed 'for the Government of the United Kingdom' the preamble (p. 140 corr.) states that the said Government are acting on behalf of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait. the Foreign Office are prepared to concede the point it would appear to be more politic to give the Shaikh signed copies.
