Telegram P., No. 240, dated (and received) 21st September 1911. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. Please refer to your telegram No. 60 and that of February 16th sent from Busreh. Foreign Office have wired as follows : — It is suggested by India Office that in their negotiations regarding Khor- remabad-Mohammerah line, the Persian Railway Syndicate should simultaneously with their application to the Persian Government, apply also to the Sheikh so as to safeguard his interests. What are your views ?” finds. Negotiations are in progress between Treasurer General and Syndicate, and latter have presented draft contract. In reply to Foreign Office I propose to advise that we should keep the Sheikh informed of developments, but that there is no more need now, than formerly to apply to him personally, provided that we take good care that his interests are safeguarded. I telegraphed some time ago recommending that draft contract be submitted to you in connection with Sheikh’s rights. Article 4 proposes that Persian Government should give any land required for railway free of cost. Such an arrangement would seem to disregard the Sheikh’s rights. Telegram P., No, 242-941, dated 29th September 1911. From—The Political Resident, Bushire, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Please refer to your telegram No. 240. I concur with course suggested by Your Excellency. ^ Sheikh will doubtless, on receipt of information from us, com municate with Persian Government and demand to be consulted. May I forthwith make a communication to him ? Telegram P., No. 462, dated (and received) 30th September 1911. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To The Toreign Office, London. (Repeated Bushire under No. 255). Please refer to my telegram No. 414 and your No. 267. In my opinion application to the Sheikh would offend Persian Government and serve no useful purpose. But I recommend that the Sheikh should be kept informed, and due2 precautions taken to ensure his rights being safeguarded. It would be advisable I think to let the Sheikh know as soon as possible that negotiations are in pro gress between the Persian Government and the Syndicate f he will then doubtless inform the former he expects to be consulted with Cox. Do you authorise me to inform the Sheikh in this sense ? I shall, of course, keep the Syndicate informed and, as far as possible, consult their convenience as to the time for making a communication to the Sheikh. Telegram P., No. 258, dated (and received) 1st October 1911. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. Please inform Sheikh that a British group of high standing, the Persian Railway Syndicate, has been in negotiations with Treasurer General with a view to a loan to the Persian Government for the construction of a railway from Khor Musa or Mohammerah to Khorremabad; construction and working of the line to be entrusted to Syndicate acting on behalf of Persian Government; and that with a view to submitting scheme to Mejlis, proposals of Syndicate have been represented to Treasurer General. Please see my telegram No 240. What are your views as to how we should deal with Sheikh in regard to article IV. Telegram P., No. 245-965, dated 2nd October 1911. From—The Political Resident, Bushire, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated His Majesty’s Consul, Moham merah). Please refer to your telegram No. 258. In my opinion we should communicate general terms of land acquisition clause and advise him to telegraph to Persian Government, saying that rumours as to railway concessions have come to his ears and that in accordance with rights under his Firman he expects that his rights will be recognised by Persian Government in all matters affecting land covered by those Firmans. Telegram P., No. 266, dated (and received) 6th October 1911. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. (Repeated Mohammerah under No. 58.) Kindly refer to your telegram No. 245-965. The Secretary of State has approved the course proposed by you. The substance of clause 4 is contained in the final paragraph of my telegram No. 240. Addressed Bushire, repeated Mohammerah. Telegram P., dated (and received) 12th October 1911. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Foreign Office, London. (Repeated Bushire under No. 278.) I am informed by Shuster that he has sounded the Cabinet and leading deputies, and that in view of the coolness towards the project displayed by even the moderate party, he considers it advisable not to submit the railway scheme to the Mejlis. Opposition, it appears, is chiefly due to the spheres of influence dictating the limits to the project. The reference is to my telegram No. 476. &gt;/?)No. 83-C. (Confidential), dated Mohammerah, the 7th October 1911. From— Captain L. Haworth, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you that in accordance with the instructions contained in your telegrams Nos. 964 and 965 of the 2nd October I informed the Sheikh of Mohammerah that a company of high standing had approached the Persian Government with the offer of a loan for the construction of a railway from Mohammerah or Khor Musa to Khorremabad, that the company was an entirely British one and proposed to construct and work the line and that the Treasury General had placed the proposals before the Cabinet with a view to their being submitted to the Mejlis. The^Sheikh left himself entirely in our hands and said that he trusted that we would see that his rights were maintained : as in my former conversation with him on the subject he referred to the fact that a railway would render him far more accessible to the Persian Government and said that he relied on us to support him against encroachments. I would suggest that while pursuing the terms of article 4 that all land would be given by the Persian Government free, it might be possible to make a private arrangement with the Sheikh allotting him a certain number of shares in the Company: it has to be remembered that though the Persian Government is or may be content to give the land free they do so in return for definite con sideration, the Sheikh who does not participate in that consideration can hardly be expected to follow their example. In so far as the railway line passes through the Sheikh’s territories he will be expected to give protection and safety to its employes : the Suzerain power then receives the benefits of the concession in the Sheikh’s lands, but it will be latter in reality who will be called upon to supply all that the Company requires, a fact which I trust will not be lost sight of in the carrying on of the negotiations. ♦ G.

November 25th. 1911* Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edv/ard Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, no: 1831, of the 15th instant, in which the Secretary of State for India endorses the view expressed by the Government of Ihdia as to the importance of obtaining a foothold at Khor Musa. I am to state in reply that Sir Edward Grey entire ly concurs in this view; but I am to recall to you the opinion of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, as contain ed in his telegram no: 452 of September 30, that an ap plication to the Sheikh of Mohammerah would be offensive to the Persian Government; and I am to add that, in pre sent circumstances, Sir Edward Grey does not consider that it would be practicable to pursue negotiations on the subject at Tehran. As you will percieve from the accompanying copy of a letter dated June 15th from Mr. Greenway - which is enclosed for convenience of reference - the Persian Railway Syndicate are already aware of the importance of securing a foothold at Khor Musa; but their attention will be again called to the matter when negotiations on the general subject of r&amp;ilfcay construction are re* sumed.

Capital would be provided by 5 per cent, bonds at 871, same as loan, interest being guaranteed by Persian Government, and secured firstly by first charge on railway and receipts, and secondly by any tangible Government present or future revenue available for hypothecation. For this secondly suggest special 4 per cent, increase in southern customs or any other increased tariff. Amount of bonds must suffice at net price to cover first, cost of survey; second, cost of construction and equipment, including cost of wharves, jetties, Ac., at port; and third, interest and administration expenses during construction.

I AM obliged for your letter of the 30th ultimo commenting on the draft telegram submitted with my letter of the 11th idem. As regaids the point dealt with in the second paragraph of your letter—viz., the power given to the Persian Government to acquire the railways—the syndicate are entirely of your view, and have guarded against this in the text of articles 19 and 34 of the draft contract sent to Mr. Brown, whereby it is made clear— 1. That the bonds shall be repayable by an amortisation fund of 1 per cent, per annum, commencing five years after the railway is opened ; and 2. That the Government can only determine the contract two years after the bonds shall have been redeemed in accordance with the terms of the contract. This, as you point out, ensures a tenure of twenty-five to thirty years. Should it be considered desirable to adapt the Bushire-Firuzabad-Shiraz road for motor traction the syndicate would be quite prepared to consider some arrangement for undertaking the work. As regards your objection to article 22, Mr. Brown had in his telegram of the 29th ultimo, copy of which has been sent to you, raised the same point, and the syndicate have met it (as you will see from reference to article 38 on page 14 of enclosed copy of telegram to Mr. Brown # ) by suggesting that one arbitrator shall be nominated by them and one by the Treasurer-General. v I will shortly send you a copy of the draft contract showing all the alterations up to date, in order that you may be in a position to follow any further telegraphic correspondence more closely.

Mr. Greenway to Mr. Mallet.—(Received September 8.) Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London, Dear Mr. Mallet, September 7, 1911. WHEN writing my letter of the 4th instant I assumed that the figure of twenty-five or thirty years given for the tenure that would be secured by an amortisation fund at the rate of 1 per cent, per annum was about the correct actuarial figure, but on looking into the question I find that the actual figures are as below : — A 1 per cent, accumulating sinking fund invested at— 5 per cent, per annum would require 36| years to extinguish the principal. 4.1 5 J J J 5) 38f 55 5 5 » 4 n &gt;&gt; 41 5 5 5 5 55 H &gt;&gt; 55 43f &gt;5 5 5 55 3 &gt;&gt; 55 47 55 55 55 ol 2 &gt;&gt; 5? 55 50f 55 55 55 Therefore the tenure secured by a 1 per cent, amortisation fund applied in annual purchases of the bonds (the most remunerative method of employing the money, and therefore the quickest method of extinguishing the bonds) would be 36j years, plus the five years before it came into operation, i.e., a minimum period of 41| years from the date of opening any one line for traffic. I do not understand the reference you have had from the Board of Trade, because we have had no communication with them on the subject. Possibly their letter referred to some other negotiations for railways in Persia ? In any case we have not suggested any payment by the Persian Government towards the sinking fund, other than the 1 per cent, per annum which is to be provided out of the railway earnings, or by the Government if the railway earnings do not suffice to cover this 1 per cent., in addition to the working expenses, interest on bonds, &amp;c. Our syndicate, of course, desires to secure the longest tenure possible, and will bear this in mind in arranging the details of the amortisation scheme with the Persian Government. Under the Bagdad Bailway concession the Germans, I believe, have a tenure of 100 years, and this we should secure if we can arrange that the amortisation be effected by annual drawings at the rate of 1 per cent.

The syndicate shall be entitled to retain for its own benefit the balance, if any, between the estimated, cost ol the construction and equipment of the said railway and the actual cost of the construction theieof foi the4 purpose of defraying any costs, charges, and expenses which may be incurred by the syndicate in connection with the subscription of the bonds mentioned in article 19 hereof or otherwise in relation to this contract and for its profit in connection therewith. Art. 17. Upon the completion of the said survey the syndicate shall notify the^ Government the period within which the said railway will be constructed, in order tha^ the same may be opened for public traffic, and shall commence the construction thereof within a period of six calendar months after the bonds mentioned in article 19 shall have been issued by the syndicate, and shall proceed with the construction thereof when commenced with all due diligence, in order that the same may be opened for public traffic as speedily as the circumstances will permit. Provided that the period to be notified by the syndicate for the construction of the said railway shall be subject to such extension as the circumstances may require in the event of the labour available for the construction thereof being inadequate or in the event of any delay arising from adverse political conditions. Art. 18. The Government will appoint a qualified British or American engineer, who shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the syndicate, for the purpose of examining the works and of certifying that the same have been constructed in accordance with the said surveys, plans, and specifications, and that the same are ready to be opened for public traffic. Art. 19. Before the syndicate shall be required to proceed with the construction of the said railway the Government shall create and the syndicate shall he authorised to issue a special loan of railway bonds sufficient at the price of 87|- per cent, to provide the amount of the estimate mentioned in article 13 hereof. Such railway bonds shall constitute a direct obligation of the Government to the holders or bearers thereof, and shall carry interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum from the date of issue, and shall be repayable by means of an amortisation fund of 1 per cent, per annum commencing five years after the said railway shall have been opened for public traffic. The principal moneys, interest, and other moneys payable in respect of the said railway bonds shall constitute a first charge upon the railways and the net receipts of the railways mentioned in article 1 hereof, and shall be further secured by a charge or appropriation in a manner and to an extent to be approved by the syndicate upon such revenues of Southern Persia as may be applicable to the purpose and he approved. Such customs duties or other securities shall be paid to the Imperial Bank of Persia at some branch in Persia to be named by the syndicate to a special account twenty-one days prior to the date for payment of each half-year’s interest in respect of the said bonds. Should the amount so paid in not be sufficient for the payment of the said interest and to provide the proportionate part of the yearly amortisation fund, the Government shall forthwith make up any deficiency. The amounts so deposited shall be applied by the said bank in paying the interest to become due in respect of the bonds next after the date when such payment ought, in accordance with the provisions of this clause, to have been made, and the bank shall apply the balance of the moneys so deposited, or such part thereof as may be necessary, in redemption of the bonds in manner provided by the conditions endorsed on the bonds. Should the sums so deposited exceed the said liabilities, the Government shall be entitled to withdraw the balance in its favour immediately after the making up of each half-yearly account. The interest upon the said railway bonds during the construction of the said railway and for a period of two years after the same shall have been opened for public traffic shall be paid and provided by the syndicate so far as the provision for that purpose contained in the estimated cost will extend. Provided, however, that, should the company be prevented from constructing the railway on account of circumstances over which the syndicate has no control, the interest and amortisation fund in respect of the bonds shall, during the period that the syndicate are so prevented from constructing the railway, be paid by 7 the Government. Art. 20. The proceeds of the issue of the said railway bonds shall he deposited in a bank in London to he approved by the syndicate to the order of the syndicate and shall be applied by the syndicate as and when required for the purpose of defraying the cost of the construction of the said railway in accordance with the plans, surveys, specifica tions, and estimates hereinbefore mentioned and of paying the interest upon the said railway bonds during the period and to the extent mentioned in article 19 hereof. Art. 21. I he Government may at any time within a period of five years from the dale of this contract require the syndicate to proceed with the survey of any of the i ail ways mentioned in article 2 hereof other than the railway hereinbefore firstly descnbed upon the same terms as are hereinbefore provided in respect of the railway 7 hereinbefore firstly described.n Art. 22. On completion of the railway hereinbefore firstly described, or earlier if the Government and the syndicate shall so agree, the Government may require the syndicate to proceed with, or the syndicate at its option may require the Government to grant to it the right to proceed with, the construction of the railway hereinbefore secondly described upon terms identical with the terms hereinbefore contained relating to the construction of the railway hereinbefore firstly described, and the syndicate shall thereupon, and subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, be bound to proceed with due diligence with the construction and equipment of the railway hereinbefore secondly described. Art. 23. On the completion of the railway hereinbefore secondly described, or earlier if the Government and the syndicate shall so agree, the Government may require the syndicate to proceed with, or the syndicate at its option may require the Government to grant to it the right to proceed with, the construction of the railway hereinbefore thirdly described upon terms identical with the terms hereinbefore contained relating to the construction of the railway hereinbefore secondly described, and the syndicate shall thereupon, and subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, be bound to proceed with due diligence with the construction and equipment of the railway hereinbefore thirdly described. Art. 24. On the completion of the railway hereinbefore thirdly described, or earlier if the Government and the syndicate shall so agree, the Government may require the syndicate to proceed with, or the syndicate at its option may require the Government to grant to it the right to proceed with, the construction of the railway hereinbefore fourthly described upon terms identical with the terms hereinbefore contained relating to the construction of the railway hereinbefore thirdly described, and the syndicate shall thereupon, and subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, be bound to proceed with due diligence with the construction and equipment of the railway hereinbefore fourthly described. Art. 25. Each of the railways mentioned in article 1 hereof, as and when completed and opened for public traffic, shall be worked and administered by the syndicate on behalf of and for the benefit and at the risk of the Government, at least until such time as the whole of the railway bonds to be issued for provision of the necessary funds for the construction and equipment of the said railways, or any one of them, shall have been redeemed by means of the amortisation fund of 1 per cent, per annum to be constituted for the redemption thereof. The syndicate shall carry on the working and administration of the said railways with due diligence and proper care, and shall provide a train service sufficient for the development of the traffic upon the said railways, when the same shall be opened for public traffic, and shall, subject to the provisions of this contract, so carry on the said railways as to produce the best results both for the said railways and for the district to be served thereby. Art. 26. The syndicate shall receive as its remuneration in each year for working the said railways pursuant to article 25 hereof, and for the expenses of its administration in London, a commission at the rate of 5 per cent, of the gross receipts of the said railways. Art. 27. For the purposes of this contract the gross receipts of the said railways shall be the aggregate amounts, whether ordinary or extraordinary, which shall be received by the syndicate on such part of the said railways as shall be for the time being open for public traffic. Art. 28. From the gross receipts from the working of the said railways there shall be deducted the following expenses :—• (a.) Working expenses. (6.) Cost of maintenance, both ordinary and extraordinary, of the lines, buildings, materials, telegraph, telephones, &amp;c. (c.) Cost of the renewal of the fixed material and rolling stock. (d.) Expenses arising by reason of accidents or thefts, fires, or force majeure. (e.) Costs of insurance of the buildings, merchandise, or passengers in connection with the said railways. (/.) The remuneration of the syndicate mentioned in article 26 hereof. {g.) Subject to the liability of the syndicate to pay and provide the interest during construction and for a period of two years thereafter in manner mentioned in article 19 hereof, the amounts required for the payment of the interest upon and the provision of the amortisation fund for any railway bonds issued m accordance with the provisions hereof, for the provision of funds for the construction and equipment of the said railways, or for the purposes of this contract. [2195 h —2] CIf the gross receipts do not suffice to meet the above expenses, the Government will, when and so soon as the accounts of the said railways lor any year shall have been completed, and within one month after payment thereof shall have been demanded by the syndicate, make up whatever deficit there may be. In the event of the gross receipts showing a surplus over the above expenses, then, subject to the payment of any previous existing deficit, such surplus shall be carried to the credit of a separate account to he applied from time to time, as the circumstances of the said railways may require, in the maintenance thereof, or in the replacement of any part of the equipment thereof, or in the construction and equipment of any extension of the said railways, and until so applied the moneys standing to the credit of such account shall be invested in the name of or under the control of the syndicate ; or In the event of the gross receipts showing a surplus over the above expenses, then, subject to the payment of any previous existing deficit, one-hal f of such surplus shall be carried to the credit of a separate account to be applied from time to time, as the circumstances of the said railways may require, in the maintenance thereof, or in the replacement of any part of the equipment thereof, or in the construction and equipment of any extension of the said railways, and until so applied the moneys standing to the credit of such account shall be invested in the name of or under the control of the syndicate, and the remaining half thereof shall be handed over to the Treasurer-General of the Government. Art. 29. The syndicate shall, during the administration of the said railways, keep proper accounts in a form usually adopted by railways, and the Treasurer-General of the Government, provided that such Treasurer-General be a natural-born citizen of the United States of America, shall be entitled at all times to inspect and audit such accounts. The syndicate shall in each year during the period aforesaid present to the Government a full statement of the receipts and expenditures connected with the said railways properly classified under the respective divisions of receipts and expenditure usually adopted by railways and including all expenditure mentioned in article 28 hereof. Except in so far as any objection in writing shall be raised by the accountant or accountants of the Government to the said accounts, and such objections shall remain outstanding, the said accounts shall be deemed to be binding upon the Government and the syndicate at the expiration of three months after the same shall have been delivered to the Government. Art. 30. As the traffic of the said railways so requires, the Government will from time to time, at the request of the syndicate, provide all such additional locomotives, rolling stock, installations, stations, buildings, goods-sheds, sidings, and other like conveniences necessary for the proper working of the said railways, provided that the syndicate shall not, if the Treasurer-General for the time being of the Government shall be a natural-born citizen of the United States of America, be entitled without the previous sanction of the Treasurer-General to rt quire the Government to incur any capital expenditure which would necessitate the issue by the Government of railway bonds other than as hereinbefore provided for the provision of funds for the construction and equipment of the said railways. Art. 31. The Government may require the syndicate to execute, and the syndicate will, as and when so required, execute, at the expense of the Government, all such additional works as the Government may deem necessary or expedient for the greater security of the public, or for the policing of the said railways, or for the convenience of the traffic thereon. Every such requisition shall be in writing, specifying the works to be executed, and shall be accompanied by a deposit with the bankers of the syndicate m Tehran of the agreed estimated cost of the works so specified, and during the construction of such works the amount so deposited shall be paid over to the syndicate in proportional amounts as required. Art. 32. The tariffs of the said railways shall be calculated upon a sterling basis at the current rate of exchange, and shall be fixed from time to time by the syndicate (with the approval of the Treasurer-General, if a natural-born citizen of the United States of America) upon the basis, as nearly as possible, of obtaining sufficient gross receipts to provide for the expenses mentioned in article 28 hereof, the object of the Government being the development of the districts to be served by the said railways by means of a tariff as low as can be reasonably fixed, and not the receipt of profits from the said railways. Art. 33. Public officials travelling by order of the competent authorities, and producing a certificate signed by such authorities to that effect, shall pay one-half of the tariff rates. The syndicate shall not issue any free passes to any persons other than their own directors, staff, and employes. The syndicate may in special cases issue to special persons tickets at one-half of the tariff rates.Art. 34. When and so soon as all the railway bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this contract shall have been redeemed, and all moneys which shall have been advanced upon the securities of the said railways or any of them or the receipts ^thereof shall have been repaid, and all moneys payable by the Government to the syndicate under the provisions hereof at the date of the notice shall have been paid, the Government may thereafter, on giving two years’ notice in writing, determine this contract, and at the expiration of such notice, and upon payment of any moneys payable to the syndicate by the Government under the provisions hereof at the date of such expiration, the syndicate shall place the Government in full possession of the said railways, their dependencies and equipment. Art. 35.

Art. 36. Every obligation of the syndicate under this contract shall be subject to the exception of force majeure, and the Government will indemnify the syndicate and the enterprise of the said railways against any damages caused by Government forces or campaign or by armed forces in rebellion against the lawful Government, the amount of the damage sustained and the mode of indemnification, in default of agreement between the Government and the syndicate, to be determined by arbitration in the manner provided by article 38 hereof. In the event of the suspension of the traffic on the said railways by force majeure, the obligation of the Government to make good any deficit in the gross receipts of the said railways as provided by article 28 hereof shall be in no way affected or diminished. Art. 37. In the event of any payment to be made by the Government hereunder being made in cash, the same shall be made at the current market rate of exchange. Art. 38. In the event of any dispute or difference arising between the parties to the present concession in respect of its interpretation or the rights or responsibilities of either of the parties therefrom resulting, such dispute or difference shall be submitted to two arbitrators at Tehran, one of whom shall be nominated by the syndicate and the other by the Treasurer-General, and to an umpire who shall be appointed by the arbitrators before they proceed to arbitrate.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 1, Commercial, of the 26th February, 1911, I have the honour to forward a copy of a communication, with enclosure, which I have addressed to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, on the subject of the proposed opening of the Luristan road. I have, &amp;c. P. z. COX, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Majesty's Consul-General for Ears, &amp;c. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Bushire, July 27, 1911. I HAVE the honour to refer to my letter of the 25th July, 1911, forwarding a copy of Lieutenant Wilson’s report on the projected Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railway. 2. In that report the possibility of a cart-road being constructed from Dizful to Khoremabad and Burujird is incidentially touched upon in some detail, being intimately bound up with the question of railway construction. No mention is, how ever, made of the possibility of opening up a caravan route through Luristan, to report on which was one of the objects of his deputation '(ride paragraph 11 of the enclosure to my letter of the 2nd October, 1910). The report, which I enclose herewith, deals with this question as far as possible on its own merits, as a proposition deserving of consideration independently of the construction of a railway line. 3. The present position in regard to this matter may be summarised as follows :— The Persian Transport Company’s concession for the Arabistan-Luristan road j expires next year; they have applied to the Persian Government for a ten years’ extension of their concession, until 24th August, 1922, as an ordinary matter of business, without the intervention of His Majesty’s Legation. This extension has not yet been granted, but Messrs. Lynch Brothers have still great hopes of obtaining it. 'Che Russian Government has no objection to such an extension, on the understanding that the concession relates only to carriage-roads and contains nothing which could enable the company to claim the right to construct railways. There seems good reason to hope that the extension desired will ultimately be conceded, in which case there will be nothing to prevent the company from setting to work on the road, should they desire to do so, except the anarchical conditions which still obtain in Luristan. Lieutenant Wilson points out that the trace of the caravan route does not corres pond, for some 70 miles of its length out of 220 from Dizful to Burujird, with that of the proposed cart-road, and that the company is likely to be unwilling to incur expenses in making such a road, building serais, &amp;c., if there is a prospect of its being replaced within a few years by a cart-road along another route, or by a railway ; he expresses the belief that the company will probably be disinclined to take active measures in the matter until some decision has been come to with regard to the construction of the railway in regard to which they claim preferential treatment. fife urges, however, that they should lose noj time in sending an engineer over both the caravan and cart-road alignments, in order that they may be placed in possession of reliable estimates of cost, &amp;c. Mr. B. Sotham, an engineer in the company’s service, went to Burujird with, I understand, this object in view in June of this year, but returned to Tehran without [2141 x —2]mmmm ■ — accomplishing anything, considering the country too disturbed to allow of his travelling to Khoremabad. As the company were at that moment engaged in negotiations with the Persian Government for an extension, on the grounds that the country had been, and still was, too disturbed to enable them to initiate operations, it is possible that Mr. Sotham’s visit and return was rather in the nature of a demonstration of the correctness of their contention than a serious attempt to travel over the road. There seems reason to hope, however, from Lieutenant Y\ ilsons report that con ditions may be more favourable this autumn, and it is to be hoped that, should this turn out to be the case, the company will not fail to avail themselves of the opportunity afforded them. . _ , i , r p I concur with Lieutenant Wilson in hoping that the proposed transfer of the “ Mai amir ” subsidy to the Lunstan road will receive favourable consideration at the hands of His Majesty’s Government in this connection. ^ ? . I have forwarded a copy of this despatch to His Majesty s roreign Omce and to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Majesty’s Consul-General for Pars, &lt;bc. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Lieutenant Wdson to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox. Bushire, July 27, 1911. 1 HAVE the honour to address you on the subject of the opening of the Luristaa road, for which the Persian Transport Company hold a concession. 2. The question has assumed fresh importance during the year owing to (1) the approaching expiry of the period in which the company was obliged, on pain of cancellation of the concession, to complete the road; (2) the entry into the region of practical politics of a Mohammerah-Khoremabad railway; (3) the energetic action taken by the Bakhtiari Governor-General of Luristan, the Amir Mufakham, to restore order in Luristan. 3. It seems desirable, therefore, that I should recapitulate briefly the main facts regarding the caravan route. Cart-road possibilities have already been discussed in my report on the proposed Arabistan-Luristan railway. The route which should be adopted for a caravan track from Dizful to Khoremabad is undoubtedly that via the Kiyalan pass, and onwards to Burujird via Zagheh. It is this route which commended itself to the common sense of previous road-makers, and was recommended by Captain Lorimer when His Majesty’s vice-consul for Arabistan. The distance from Dizful to Khoremabad by this route is approximately 124 miles, in eight stages, as follows: Kal’eh Husainiyeh. Kal’eh Riza. Birinjzar. Sargul. Mishwand. Kal’eh Nasir. Chimashk. Shahin Shah. Khoremabad. Serais are in existence and are in good repair at Chimashk and Shahin Shah, and in fair order at Kal’eh Nasir and Kal’eh Riza, leaving four new ones to be erected by the company. The road is already practicable for loaded mules, and no great outlay would be necessary to put it into very fair order. No large bridges are necessary, but three or four small ones are needed, which can be built at small expense by local labour of local material. 4. The Amir Mufakham, Governor-General of Luristan, has assured me of his desire to see the road opened by us, and of his readiness to assist us, provided that he receives definite and categorical orders on the subject from the central Government. His active measures to restore order in his province, and the success that has up to now attended his efforts, give every reason to hope that he will soon be in a position to make good his promises.The best possible guarantee that he will bestir himself, and the best chance of his giving effect to the scheme, will be afforded by the deputation to Luristan of an engineer by the Persian Transport Compan} 7 , empowered to negotiate and provided with the necessary orders from the central Government to the Governor-General. tk competent engineer once on the spot, difficulties will vanish in the face of a deter mined effort to get the thing done, an effort which the company have yet to make. 5. At the same time, it cannot be denied that the Persian Transport Company have more reason at the present moment than, perhaps, at any previous time to hesitate before embarking on this enterprise. They have not as yet obtained an extension of their concession, though, were they to start work promptly, they might still get the road into working order before the 22nd August, 1912. For 70 miles or so the caravan track does not correspond with the proposed cart-track alignment, which diverges between KaTeh Riza and Birinjzar, and runs to Jaidar across the Kashgan to Madian Rud, and thence to Khoremabad. 6. A decision on the part of His Majesty’s Government to press the construction of the cart-road through Luristan might be held by the company to render much of their expenditure on the Kiyalan route unproductive, though not necessarily so, as, for some years to come, traffic would have to be solely by pack mules, which would naturally be taken over the Kiyalan route. Upon this and allied questions the opinion of an experienced engineer would be of value. 7. Should the company decide to commence work on the caravan route, I am of the opinion that they should, for the present, deal with the tribes through the Governor- General, and not direct, as the chiefs are quite untrustworthy and incapable of enforc ing compliance by their followers with the terms of any agreement which they may conclude. 8. The transfer of the u Malamir ” subsidy to the Luristan road would, no doubt, be a great inducement to the company to commence work on a caravan track indepen dently of the cart track or railway question, and I venture to express a hope that the proposal will not be lost sight of in this connection. I have, &amp;c. A. T. WILSON, Lieutenant, I. A.EASTERN DEPARTMENT. [August 21. j SECRET SERIES. 8 Section 4. [33029] No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 21.) (No. 1.) Sir, Bushire, July 25, 1911. IN case the matter may be under lively consideration at His Majesty’s Foreign honour to forward, for your Excellency’s information, copies of a letter, with enclosures, which I have addressed to the Government of India, forwarding Lieutenant Wilson’s report upon the projected Mohammerah-Khoremabad Lailway. 2. In view of the insecurity of communication by post, I have sent a duplicate co py of this communication, addressed to your Excellency, through the Foreign Office, London. (Confidential.) Sir, Bushire, July 25, 1911. I HAVE the honour to refer to the correspondence starting with my letter dated the 2nd October, 1910, recommending Lieutenant Wilson’s deputation to examine the possibilities of railway alignments from Dizful northwards through Luristan. The Government of India will have seen from the interesting diaries which he has furnished during his absence that his journeys have been by no means uneventful, but a combination of judgment and good fortune has brought him through safely, and I now have the honour to submit a copy of his report for the information of higher authority. I may mention incidentally that, in considering the Khor Musa (or Mohammerah)-Khoremabad project as a whole he has found it advisable to bring up to date the report on the Mohammerah—Dizful section which was forwarded to the Government of India under my despatch of the 2nd October, 1910. The result forms Part II of his report. Office, I venture to submit direct two copies of a communication, with enclosures, which I have addressed to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment, forwarding a copy of Lieutenant Wilson’s report upon the projected Mohammerah- Khoremabad Railway. I have also sent a copy to His Majesty’s India Office and to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. I have, &amp;c. P. Z.

In case consideration of the question may be imminent, I have ventured to submit copies of this letter and its enclosures direct to His Majesty’s Foreign and India Offices. I have, &amp;c. P. Z.

The supplementary tracing vrhich I have asked him to prepare, and which if laid over his map,* will indicate the course of his subsidiary wanderings, will show that he has made a comprehensive examination of the tract within the limits of which a practicable alignment might conceivably fall, and the result of his investigations is to confirm the primd facie impression formed by previous travellers, e.g., Sir Thomas^ Gordon and Captain Lorimer, that the best alignment would be found either up, or to the west of, the Kashgan valley. The full details, which are furnished in Part III 0 f the present report, in regard to both alternatives, will, it is hoped, enable ^railway experts to arrive at definite conclusions as to the practicability and probable cost of a railway through this piece of country, which, on the grounds explained by him Lieutenant Wilson is convinced is the only one which can be regarded as reasonably practicable. For the cheaper of the two alignments, taking the distance from Moham- merah to Dizful as 174 miles, and from Dizful to Khoremabad as 185 miles total 359—he estimates that the cost per mile will work out to 6,395L for the 5-feet gauge and 4,460Z. for a metre gauge line, and favours the latter alternative. 3. In the course of his deputation, Lieutenant Wilson has incidentally given much thought to other aspects of the contemplated railway than the purely practical one, and in Part I of his report he endeavours to marshal the principal, general, and political considerations affecting the project considered both independently, and in their bearing on the Gulf section of the Bagdad Bailway, as they now present themselves to his mind. The trend of his arguments on the whole is in favour of a rest on our oars for the present in regard to the pushing of the project, at all events, in respect of the section from Dizful onwards. 4. The salient points of his observations appear to me to be these :— (1.) In the course of his return journey he passed through Bagdad, and had the advantage of discussing recent developments with Mr. Lorimer, who had just returned from Constantinople. As the result of their deliberations he is convinced that the construction of the Bagdad-Gulf section is essential to the preservation of our interests in Bagdad itself and in Mesopotamia generally, and further that it would be premature to despair of our ultimately obtaining a predominant part in the management of the Gulf section. (2.) That in any case the Bagdad-Bussorah connection will pay even if deprived of the Persian trade which may be deflected to the Mohammerah line, and that consequently the building of the latter line, though it may delay the construction and reduce the profits of the other, will not prevent its eventual completion. He doubts, therefore, whether the Mohammerah line will prove, except temporarily, to possess so much competitive or political advantage as is at present supposed. (3.) He is inclined to share the apprehension which the Sheikh of Mohammerah recently expressed,! tlie piercing of the Luristan “ buffer ” may have the effect of destroying the territorial isolation of Arabistan, to which, combined with our consistent support, Sheikh Khaz’al Khan, in a great measure, owes the present strength of his position. This apprehension would be accentuated if the line were made international. (4.) He thinks that owing to the chronically disturbed state of Luristan, we may find ourselves obliged to intervene to protect the line. I he foregoing and other minor considerations bring bim to the view that no action should be taken by us beyond Dizful unless the German or Turkish attitude in regard to the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway forces it upon us; and that from Dizful north wards we should rely for the present on our road concession to maintain the commercial interests which we now possess in the markets focussing at Hamadan. 5. I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by my discussing in detail the many points raised in his report, especially as there is, in regard to several of them, scope for wide difference of view, or even for the use of the same facts for argument in an opposite direction. On the whole, the conclusions to which Lieutenant Wilson is led, brings us to a position which, speaking broadly, does not differ greatly from that indicated in Sir George Barclay’s telegram No. 68 of the 27th February to the Foreign Office, and in my telegram of the 17th March.]: 1 here are certain aspects of the question, however, on which I venture to touch briefly. * Not reproduced. t Resident to Government of India, May 14; Resident to Minister, May 14, 1911. j lo Ilis Majesty s Minister, No. 45, of which a cop 3 T was forwarded to the Roreigm Department with my letter of March 19, 1911.6. Firstly, I would observe that we seem warranted in considering that the strong* disapproval with which the announcement of our application for an option or concession to construct this line was received in Russian and German quarters, is in itself primd facie evidence of the value of the project to us, both as a means of safeguarding the •pmmercial inteiests which we already possess in the region of which Hamadan is the centre, and as a lever for obtaining satisfactory terms in regard to the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway. 7. The Apprehensions of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. —I am inclined to doubt if tie giounds foi them are so serious as the sheikh and Lieutenant Wilson anticipate. I presum i in this connection that we should take all possible steps to safeguard the sheikh s interests, and in any case, the connection of Tehran by rail with Kermanshah, and of Mohammerah with Dizful, would inevitably make Mohammerah more accessible from Tehran than now, and I doubt whether the more ability of a Persian regiment to ci oss Lunstan would greatly alter the position, as far as the sheikh is concerned. b rom a financial point of view the latter could not fail to benefit greatly from the construction of the line. As it is, the customs revenue has greatly increased since he resigned it to the central Government ten years ago, in return for an annuity which then represented a much larger percentage of the receipts than it does now, and should a further development of Mohammerah as a port of entry take place he would certainly be entitled to our support in pressing for a substantial increase of his piesent compensatory allowance. 8. The Value of the Khor Musa Outlet for the Railway. —'Lieutenant Wilson’s somewhat pessimistic views of the possibilities of Khor Musa as a commercial terminus do not take into account its strategical advantages, and generally differ a good deal from the conclusions arrived at by His Majesty’s naval authorities when the locality was examined in 1904 (vide the papers marginally cited, to which I beg reference).* 9. The Question of Internationalisation. —This is an aspect of the railway project, which I should regard with great apprehension did I not presume that it was intended’ and would be possibly, either to circumvent the difficulty altogether or to effect an arrangement for keeping the control sufficiently in our hands in the way suggested by the Regent. | In this connection Captain Haworth suggests^: to me, and I beg that the point may be considered, that the mere existence and the nature of our engagements to the Sheikh of Mohammerah—of which the Persian Government, and I, believe, the Russian Government, are generally aware—make it possible for us to claim independently of any Anglo-Russian convention, that Mohammerah territory is a sphere of British influence, in the development of which we are entitled to have a predominant voice, and which we are under no obligation either to regard as neutral ground except vis-a-vis Russia, or to admit the intrusion therein of any foreign element except under conditions conducive to our own interest and those of the sheikh. Whether or not this view can be strictly maintained in theory, it is a fact that we have more than once in recent years made effective use of it in practice, and our special position has, I submit, received tacit recognition. I may instance our negotiations with the Netherlands Government in regard to the Dutch option for an irrigation concession on the Karim, and our frank communication to the Turkish authorities in connection with the Zain incident. § 10. Turning to the present aspect of the railway question as indicated by the refusal of the Government of the day in Tehran to accede to our application for an option, I venture, in conclusion, to offer the following suggestion :— That we should forthwith secure a lease from the Sheikh of Mohammerah of the shores and islets of the Khor Musa. These are a recognised part of the Fallahieh district, which was granted to him by Royal farman in January 1903. The sheikh would be in precisely the same position in respect of a lease of it as he was in the case of the oil company’s site on Abadan, of which his ownership is covered by a farman in exactly similar terms. If any action in this direction were decided upon, it would be important to put through the necessary preliminaries, such as an unobtrusive examina tion of sites, with as little delay as possible. || The possibility in the last resort of preventing a concession going to other parties * * * § * Enclosure to Government of India in the Foreign Department, Secret letter, March 24, 1904. f Vide Foreign Office despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador, St. Petersburgh, No. 129, May 10, 1910. f Sir George Barclay to Foreign Office despatch No. 55, April 18, 1911. § Vide Sub-Enclosure 3 to Embassy despatch No. 402, June 21, 1910, to His Majesty’s Foreign Office. || Vide Enclosure to despatch No. 50, July 16, 1910, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, and letter 'of same date to Government of India.by inducing the sheikh to demand one himself is a contingency which wiil not perhaps be lost sight of, but which it seems premature, in the absence of fresh developments, to do more than adumbrate here. I have, &amp;c. P. z. COX, Political Resident in the Persian Gvlf. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Pieutenant Wilson to Lieutenant‘Colonel Cox. g- r Bushire, July 25, 1911. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith my report on the proposed Ihohammerah- Khoremabad Railway, which I take the liberty to summarise briefly below. 2. I estimate the cost of the whole line to be about 2,335,000Z. from Mohammerah toKhoremabad, equivalent to about 6,480Z. a-mile for 360 miles, on a ruling gradient of 1 in 50. The above figures are for Russian gauge (5 feet). At metre gauge the approximate cost would, I believe, be 1,650,000L 3. I believe the project to have a fair prospect of commercial success were metre gauge to be adopted, though there seems even then to be no likelihood of it being worth 'while for any Rritish company to build it without a guaiantee from the Rritish or Persian Government. _ ^ . . 4. On the general question of its effect on Rritish strategical, political and com mercial interests, I express, with the greatest deference, my belief that our strategical position vis-d-vis Russia will not be substantially altered by the railway, if built, but I regard its probable effect on our political interests in the Gulf and in South-West Persia generally with some apprehension. The tendency of the railway will be to weaken the autonomous position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, thus paving the w r ay for a recrudescence in Arabistan of the anarchy which reigns supreme everywhere else in Persia, and which so handicapped our commerce in the years 1889-1895 between the opening of the Karun and the accession of the present sheikh. 5. Its inception will make the construction of railways in the north by Russia, and the continuation of the Khanikin line to Kermanshah inevitable, if indeed this is not already the case, though of course the converse of the proposition equally holds good. Since the Persian Government, as far as we can see, are not likely to be able to govern Luristan more effectively during the next decade than they have done in the past two centuries, we must face the contingency of being called upon to take our own measures for the protection of the line at some future time. The Lur tribes are not at all formidable enemies, in my opinion, but the possibility of being called^ upon kq guard such a long line of railway will be a considerable addition to our commitments in this part of Persia, without, it seems to be, any commensurate gain to our commerce. An international expedition with the same object would be even more objectionable. The prospect of the line being placed under international control is not one that we can view with complacency ; it could scarcely fail to prejudice gravely our position m Arabistan, and would lead to complications with the sheikh. 6. As regards the effect of the line on our commerce in Persia, I have expressed the belief that our predominance in the markets of which Hamadan is the centre will not be seriously threatened until Kermanshah is linked up with Bagdad, and that the projected Luristan line would not appreciably alter the proportion of British imports now con sumed, though it should lead to a substantial increase in the quantity of goods^ passing through the hands of British firms and imported and exported in British ships. Its main effect would be to displace the Russian sugar and hardware now entering from the north by the produce of Germany, France, and Austria (though imported, we may hope, by British firms) and Russian oil by the products of the Anglo-Persian ^ Oil Company, but the demand in Western Persia for the last-named commodity is not likely to assume importance for many years to come. # . 7. The effect of the proposed railway on the Bagdad-Persian Gulf line would e, I believe, to deprive the latter of a considerable proportion of its upward tratnc, an impair its prospects of being financially profitable until irrigation on a large scale is introduced into Mesopotamia, but this result will not be attained unless the line is prolonged at once to Burujird at least.I cannot believe, however, that it will for long postpone the construction of the Bagdad—Persian Gulf line, nor permanently damage its position. I am much impressed with the inadequacy of the Tigris and the importance to us of a Bagdad-Bussorah Ga ail way which will place the capital of Mesopotamia in close touch with British shipping ^ftnd go far to help us to retain our position in Bagdad, if honestly worked. If Bagdad is linked up with Europe, but not with the Gulf (and the Tigris is no substitute for a railway for this purpose) a hundred factors will tend to alienate Mesopotamia from the Principal seats of our commercial and political influence in the Middle East, and a diminution of our political prestige will follow, a serious matter when it is remembered that Bagdad is the centre of the pilgrim traffic of large sections of the Mahommedan world. I he Bombay mills, moreover, are indisputably destined to find in Mesopotamia a large and increasing market for their products. 8. I submit that we should use the Mohammerah—Khoremabad option only as a lever to obtain fair terms for ourselves on the Bagdad—Persian Gulf Railways, and that we should not take active steps to build it unless forced to do so by, for instance, the prospect of the right to do so being granted to others, or by failure on our part to obtain a predominant share in the Bagdad—Gulf section. In the latter contingency, I have advocated the construction of a Mohammerah—Dizful line, connected with Khoremabad and Burujird by good cart roads, for which we already have a concession, in this way securing to ourselves most of the benefits of the railway without the political risks which, it is suggested, its construction would involve. 9. The map accompanying this report is the result of a continued plane table and prismatic compass survey ; the original sheets are forwarded without any adjustment or alteration; each week’s work was inked in regularly, as it was impossible to keep the work in pencil only so long a period; the map is, in consequence, I fear, unsuited to photographic reproduction, and will have to be redrawn by a draughtsman ; in extenuation of my defective caligraphy I can only say that I had no tables or chairs in camp with me and no draughtsman’s apparatus; all detail on the map except south of the Kabir Kuh represents actual observation by myself, and I have not “ compiled ” any portion of it, except north of Khoremabad, where I was prohibited by my instructions from surveying. 10. Breakdown of my camera at the outset of my journey unfortunately prevented my obtaining any photographic records; the photogravures enclosed herewith are extracted from De Morgan’s “ Mission Scientifique en Perse.” 11.

WILSON, On Special Duty. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Report by Lieutenant Wilson on the proposed Railway from Khor Musa to Khoremabad, and its prolongation to Burujird. Part I.—General and Political Considerations. WHILST fully realising that any decision on the part of His Majesty’s Government, in regard to the construction of railways in South-western Persia, must ultimately depend upon considerations of which I am for the most part ignorant, and regarding which I am not competent to express an opinion, it seems, nevertheless, convenient that I should preface this report on the practical aspects of the projected Luristan line by a brief summary of some of the principal general and political considerations affecting it, as far as I am aware of them. 2. The Attitude of the Russian Government. The attitude of the Russian Government to the Luristan project has undergone a notable change since 1907, and it had declared its strong dislike, on commercial grounds, of any railway which approaches the Russian zone from the south, whilst recognising our right to construct the Luristan line as far as Khoremabad, Russian Foreign [2150 4] C6 Ministers have been unanimous in their belief that the Russian public opinion would be strongly opposed to any action by Great Britain in such a direction. No great outcry, however, seems to have been made by the Russian press, which has shown less interest in the matter than that of Germany, and Russia has been unable to^ offer any valid reason for opposing us in this direction, whilst assisting Germany to join up Bagdad^ with Tehran. _ . . -ini Hostile as Russia undoubtedly is to the project, it seems improbable that she will be able to press her objections so strongly as to affect materially whatever decision may be arrived at by His Majesty’s Government. Her need of British capital for railways in the north alone suffices to make her practically unable to offer deteimined diplomatic opposition to our proposals. &gt; . She may, however, effectively oppose our entry into the Russian sphere by an extension of our line to Burujird, and may place obstacles in the way of any connection beino' made between our terminus there and Russian lines which may, in the meantime, have been brought down from the north ; she might also hamper us by stipulating for international control, and by opposing the running of motor traffic on our roads, should we desire to initiate such between Khoiemabad and Burujird, for instance, or from Burujird northwards. . 3. Relation of the Project to and its effect on the Bagdad Railway. As long as 1891, M. de Morgan, chief of the “ Delegation Scientifique en Perse,” in his published reports, discussed briefly the Luristan railway project, and came to the conclusion that, as a commercial speculation, it could not bear comparison with the Bagdad-Kermanshah line, which had few physical difficulties to contend with. From the purely commercial point of view this seems not improbable, particularly when it is remembered that a Bagdad-Kermanshah line might form part of a great through route to India from Europe via Constantinople. But it will connect Western Persia with the sea by a section passing wholly through Turkish territory, and having its terminus in non-Persian territory, a state of things contrary to the interests of Persia generally. On the other hand, the principal shrines of the Shi’eh faith are close to Bagdad, and thus even the passenger traffic on the Khanikin will be in itself a source of profit.* As regards good traffic: from Bagdad the stream of exports from Persia will inevitably flow towards the Gulf in the main, and imports will follow this route for the most part, whether the Persian Gulf—Bagdad Railway be constructed or not. It may be assumed, therefore, that the Bagdad-Kermanshah line will be remunerative from the first, even though it will be subject to the competition of the Luristan line, which would deprive it of a considerable portion of its goods traffic, and a part of its passenger traffic. Being shorter, and for the whole of its length in Persian soil, thus avoiding Turkish dues and exactions, the Luristan line will have an initial advantage which no reasonable adjustment of rates on the Turkish line could entirely neutralise. Even at present the weight of goods imported to and exported from Kermanshah via Khanikin, aggregates nearly 50,000 tons. I conclude, therefore, that the Luristan line would have a markedly unfavourable, but not ruinous effect on the Persian Gulf-Bagdad line, and to a much less degree on the Bagdad Railway as a whole. Its‘ construction might so reduce the prospective traffic on the Persian Gulf-Bagdad Railway as to make it impossible for the latter to earn enough to be financially profitable for some years to come, or until irrigation on a large scale has been introduced and extended in Mesopotamia, thus robbing the line of its attraction to investors. I cannot, however, believe that the construction of the Luristan line will for long postpone the realisation of the Bagdad-Gulf project, nor permanently damage the financial prospects of the latter; its effects are likely, however, to be sufficiently to make the threat of its construction a valuable lever when negotiating with Germany or Turkey. The value of the line as a lever will be small, however, unless prolonged beyond Khoremabad to the great commercial centres of which Hamadan is the chief, or at least as far as Burujird. From Bussorah to Bagdad by rail (350) miles is no further * The number of pilgrims from Persia who passed Khanikin in 1905 was 95,000; in 1910, 55,000, according to Turkish quarantine statistics; a considerable increase may be expected as a result of railway construction on this line.than from Mohammerah to Khoremabad, and the former line will undoubtedly be cheaper to construct than the latter. I have suggested (paragraph 9 ) a rate of 4/. a-ton as the cheapest average rate we can afford to charge on goods between Mohammerah and Khoremabad. How does ■this compare with the actual river rates and prospective railway rates between xlagdad and Bussorah ? The following tables may throw some light on the point.— Statement showing Freights charged in 1910 on Goods between Bussorah and Bagdad and vice versa. Class. Imports. Exports. Total. Rate per Ton.

The conclusion I draw from these figures is, that if Khoremabad is to be the distributing centre and terminus of the Luristan line, it will not be able io compete with BaoHad, which has great initial advantages over a small isolated town like Khoremabad.' In order to fulfil its object the line must be prolonged at all events as far as Burujird. We have not given up all hope of participating in the Bagdad-Bussorah Bailway, the construction of which is of the greatest importance to us as a set-off to the Constantinople—Bagdad line, which will tend to alienate Mesopotamia from the principal seats of our commercial and political influence in the Middle East. Until we are forced to abandon hope of retaining a predominant share in such a line, it would seem to be against our interests to take any active steps towards the construction of a Luristan line, which is in itself politically and perhaps strategically objectionable, and which may ultimately prejudice our interests in Mesopotamia.8 Even were we to pursue the scheme, however, the necessity for us to join in 'building the Bagdad-Bussorah line would be none the less imperative in the interests of our position in Mesopotamia. Were we to build a railway from Mohammerah to Dizful (a line costing but little and with every prospect of paying its way at^ metre gauge eventually, if the feeder* roads to the north were built and properly organised), and to reserve to ourselves the right to extend it to Khoremabad, we should prevent any possibility of railway enterprise by other nations in this region, and at the same time retain in our hands a valuable lever to force the Turks to give us a predominant share in the Tigris Valley Bailway Company when it comes to be formed. ^ It is scarcely necessary to add that there is no point south of Khoremabad except Dizful which could be made a terminus of the projected line, and the suggestions of the Bussian Government in this connection are quite impracticable. 4. Attitude of the Persian Government. The superior advantages of the Luristan Bailway over the Bagdad-Kermanshah project from the point of view of the Persian Government, if the former is alternative to and not in addition to the latter, is so strong as to need no laboured demonstration. It is to Persia’s interest that her exports and imports should flow in channels wholly within her borders and under her control, and that ail the indirect benefits following on the establishment of an important port should accrue to her and not to the Turkish Government. It is to her interest to strengthen her hold upon her south-western provinces, and no more powerful interest than the railway now under discussion could be desired for the purpose. No alignment between the northern end of the Gulf and Western Persia, by which I mean the country of which Kermanshah and Hamadan are the centres, will suit the Central Government equally well. The next best, from her point of viewq would be a Mohammerah-Ispahan line, but this has been pronounced, after careful expert examina tion by Major W. B. Morton, B.E., to present prohibitive physical obstacles to a cart-road, from which it may he inferred that a railway is likewise impracticable. The rescript of Nasr-ud-Din Shah in reference to a Tehran-Shushter railway is w T ell known, and need not be further referred to. The Persian Government may be expected, I conclude, ultimately to favour the project, though great difficulty will doubtless be met with in obtaining a concession on anything like equitable terms. It will probably be difficult to reconcile the rights of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in the matter, as guaranteed to him by us, with the claims and pretensions of the Persian Government. 5. Probable effect of proposed Pailway on British Political, Strategical, and Commercial Interests. On this subject the view which I respectfully submit below may be summarised by saying that the prospect is unattractive as a commercial speculation, and its political disadvantages, which are ultimately largely commercial ones, outweigh, in my belief, any advantage wBich it may afford to our commerce in West Persia ; strategically the line would appear to be of small importance to us. The arguments against the construction of a line connecting Arabistan with West Persia may be summarised as follows :— We are already strongly established in Arabistan with sufficient security for our trade, and with every opportunity for increasing it by extension of oil works, irrigation, &amp;c Whilst a light railway to Dizful would undoubtedly assist the develop ment of the province (as w^ould also the Luristan road from Dizful to Burujird), the Karun at present provides a sufficiently good channel as far as Shushter for local requirements, and, as regards Dizful, there is nothing to prevent the utilisation of the Diz for that purpose to within 20 miles of that town. The Luristan line will contribute but little to the development of Arabistan (Mohammerah, of course, being excluded), as the agricultural products of the province must always go south, not north, by boat and not by rail, and it is from the south that the vast bulk of its needs must be supplied; if under international and not British control the line may lead to an actual diminution of our prestige and to all sorts of complications with the sheikh. Bussia’s economic and political progress southwards has hitherto been checked by the Zagros Mountains; if these be pierced by a railway our position in Arabistan willTdg weakened, and there is nothing to show that we shall obtain anything like adequate compensation in the markets of West Persia, in which British goods greatly preponderate at present, and are likely to do so at all events until Kermanshah is joined up with Bagdad. 1 r. The following figures for the foreign trade of Hamadan supplied by the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia may be considered, I think, to support this contention :— British trade— United King-dom—^ £ Piece goods (worth about lOOt a ton) India— Spices, copper ware, tea, cotton, yam, thread, indigo • * .. 850,000 180,000 Total British trade .. .. • • .. 1,030,000 Russian trade— Sugar .. .. .. .. ,. Oil Glass, hardware, &amp;c. Irom from Ardabil .. .. .. ,, Cheap prints, &amp;c. •• 80,000 10,000 ,, 5,000 6,000 .. 7,000 Germany, America, and France— Drugs, woollens, fancy goods, synthetic indigo .. Turkey— Skins, figs, dates 108,000 100,000 32,000 Total foreign trade ., .. • , 240,000 The construction of the railway would probably cause a displacement of Russian oil by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and of Russian sugar and hardware by the produce of Western Europe, but it seems that British trade would only benefit by the general improvement in commerce that may be expected to follow upon the construction of the line. I do not forget that it is British firms who may be expected to import sugar and hardware in displacement of Russian products, thus enabling them to increase their exports, but I do not think that the prospective profits under this head are likely to be sufficient to affect materially the situation as I have depicted it. We have built up considerable commercial interests in Arabistan under the security provided by the strong and autonomous regime of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. A railway connecting Arabistan with Western Persia can scarcely fail to weaken his powers, without bringing to him or to us any counterbalancing advantage. ^ His rent- roll will be somewhat swelled, it is true, but that will not compensate him for the destruction of the geographical isolation of his territories from the rest of Persia which will follow the construction of the railway. As for the Turks, he would sooner deal with them single-handed than with the aid of such a two-edged weapon as the armed assistance of the Persian Government. The temporary extension of the Persian Government’s influence and maleficent administrative activity to Arabistan from 1880 to 1895 was synchronous with a period of almost continuous disorder, which so hampered British commercial enterprise in the provinces that the opening of the Karun remained for years almost without effect and our trade was nearly strangled, and it is only now beginning to recover from the effects of that treatment. This state of things ceased only when Sheikh Khaz’al, by his wise and far-seeing policy, contrived to emancipate himself from the arbitrary interference of the Persian Government, patriarchically and without molestation, so long as he paid the Government revenue regularly, which he has done ever since. There is no reason whatever to suppose that an extension of the Persian Government’s facilities for inter ference will not have precisely the same effect in the future as in the past. The projected line will in no way meet Indian passenger traffic or mail require ments, and the advantage which it will secure to our commerce in Central Persia will presumably be neutralised to a large extent by Russian railway construction advancing part passu from the north. The construction of the Bagdad-Kermanshah line, if we have a predominant share in the Bagdad-Gulf section, will assist our commerce in an almost degree, and leave us relatively to Russia in much the same position we at present occupy in the markets of Central Persia. [2150 x —1] D10 Finally it S66ms improl)al)l6 that tliG Persian Government could itself permanently secure the safety of the railway if built, or even the freedom of the construction from molestation by the tribesmen ; we might easily be called on to send troops to Khoremabad to protect the line from destruction, and it is not endangered thereby. International interference with the same object would he even more _ obnoxious to us This obiection applies, it is true, to road construction m Lunstan, but m the latter case* the capital involved is comparatively quite small, and the amount of damage that can be done less. , . , ., 6 Such are some of the arguments which may be urged against the railway apart from its financial aspects, which are dealt with below (paragraph 9). In favour of the line it may be urged that the Bagdad-Kermanshah line, connected as it is with Bussorah bv river only, is not suited to convey agricultural produce to the sea, that it will not sufficiently develop the export trade, which will be hampered by transit dues, and it is upon an increased export trade that we must rely to obtain any substantial increase in the volume of our imports. It may furthei be said that Turkish obstruction may be counted on as a certainty, and that we shall in practice be unable to guarantee that freight rates will not be manipulated to our disadvantage, as in the case of the Hambur^-Amerika line. But if these objections can be satisfactorily met, much of the necessity from our point of view of the Luristan line, would seem to disappear. Control of the Bagdad section should enable us to prevent differential rates on the Khanikin-Kermanshah extension. , It may be pointed out that the Mohammerah line is vastly superior, from the point of view of purely Persian interests, and that our oil industry m South-western Persia will benefit by the line, and stress may be laid on the rapid increase of trade that will follow the construction of the railroad; this is undoubtedly a good argument, but it presupposes the restoration and maintenance of order m South-western Persia, a consummation still far distant, specially in Luristan. To a large extent, moreover, the Bagdad-Kermanshah Railway will have the same effect at a minimum of expense and without the political and financial risks that, it has been suggested, a railway may involve. n nr t , As regards the effect of the railway upon the Sheikh of Mohammerah, it may be held that, as in the past so in the future, he will adapt himself to altered circumstances, and, with our support, maintain his present position vis-d-yis the Persian Government, An investigation of this point, however, involves the discussion of probabilities and contingencies too remote for consideration within the limits of this report. 7.° It may be urged that, for strategical reasons connected with the defence of India, it is undesirable that a connection should be made by rail between Central Persia and the head of the Persian Gulf, but such considerations apply with greater force to the Trans-Persian Railway, which, it is understood, has been accepted in principle by the Government of India, subject to proper safeguards. In any case, as long as we have naval predominance in the Gulf, the Luristan Railway can have little value to Russia, more particularly if its terminus be at Mohammerah, up the Shatt-el- Arab River, and not at Khor Musa. It may also be argued, on the other hand, that “the time may come when the power of rapidly moving a force to Tehran or its neighbourhood by so short a from India may be of great advantage ” (memorandum by Major Baird, D.S.O., dated the 5th June, 1907, printed by chief of stall’s division, India). Such prospective value to us seems, however, very problematic, as also its military value to Russia, and I do not think that we need have any serious apprehensions as to the strategical effect of the line upon our position in the Gulf. _ My humble opinion, after weighing the advantages and disadvantages ot the Luristan line is that the best course for us would be to build the Mohammerah-Diziul Railway as soon as possible and connect at once by a well-built road to Khoremabad and Burujird. , From Dizful to Hamadan by road is about 250 miles, from Bagdad to Hamadan about 325. We shall, then, be able to land goods at Hamadan at all events as cheaply via Dizful as we are now able to do via Bagdad, and far more expeditiously. When e railway is completed as far as Bagdad we should then, and not till then, start on e Dizful-Khoremabad section, in anticipation of the prolongation to Khamkm built,* should we by this time have been forced to give up hope of controlling e Bagdad section, predominance on which would render the construction of the Luns an line in my view, superfluous, in view of the political objections to it. * There is, I understand, a possibility of the main line passing through Khanikin to Bagdad.It would probably be to the advantage of both ourselves and Russia to prevent railway construction in Persia for another ten years, but as Germany seems to have succeeded in compelling Russia to abandon this policy, the course I have outlined above seems to offer the fewest objections. It involves no large outlay, and would probably be financially remunerative before long; it also makes no great addition to our ™ mmitments in this part of Persia. 8. Gauge of proposed Bailway. We may assume that for our purposes there are three possible gauges, 5 feet, 4 ft. 8|- in., and metre gauge. There would seem at first sight to be good primd facie grounds for choosing the Russian (5 feet) gauge, which would facilitate the prolonga tion from Khoremabad to Burujird, which I believe to be essential to the success of the line, and the extensions thence to some point or points on the Russian railway from the north when it comes to he constructed. But I have submitted in the succeeding paragraph that it is only by building the line to metre gauge that we can ever hope to make it a financially sound proposition. This argument should suffice to outweigh any objection by Russia against the break of gauge, which is in itself strategically most desirable. The financial argument has the additional advantage of enabling us to put forward strong reasons for a break of gauge on the border of the neutral zone no less than on that of the British zone. The 4 ft. 8|- in. gauge, as used on the Bagdad Railway, enables a high rate of speed to be attained by heavy trains, but it is financially objectionable, and would be so on strategical grounds should the Tehran-Khanikin line be built to this gauge. The 2 ft. 6 in. gauge advocated by Sir T. E. Gordon is, I would submit, too small to be economical; it has only been adopted in India for a few hill railways of exceptional difficulty and some feeder lines in Southern India. The metre gauge is much the cheapest and can be used with sharper curvature than the broader gauges; the rate of speed is slower and the maximum load that a train can carry is less. As the Luristan line is never likely to be a mail or main passenger line, the slower speed seems unimportant; and as regards the traffic it could carry, though I can profess no expert knowledge on the subject, I venture to record my belief that a metre gauge will be ample for the requirements of the country for the next twenty-five years at any rate. Putting the train load at the low figure of 400 tons, one train a day would deal with 150,000 tons a year. This question is further dealt with in the next paragraph. Whilst considering the metre gauge for financial and strategical reasons in every way preferable, I have nevertheless estimated for a broad gauge line, whilst adding estimates for meter gauge as far as I am able to deduce them. 9. Financial Prospects of the Line. The estimates of cost of the line (5 feet gauge) are based on the same classification as that adopted by Mr. John for the Baluchistan line, which provided for 5 ft. 6 in. gauge, 62 lb. rails, wooden sleepers, and a small quantity of rolling stock, stations, &amp;c., on a moderate scale. Iron sleepers would, however, be undoubtedly necessary, owing to the prevalence of white ants and the temptation to theft which wooden sleepers would offes to the tribes. The details of the proposed alignments and their estimated cost will be found in Part II and III of this report. They may be summarised as follows (converted into £ from rupees):— Miles. 5-feet Gauge. Metre Gauge. Via Kuh-i-Dasht— Mohamraerah-Dizful Dizful-Khoremabad .. Total .. ..

On the assumption that the cost would dimmish proportionately to the gauge (thouobi I believe that it is the general experience of railway engineers that the reduction of cost is not as a rule proportionately equal to the reduction in gauge) the cost of the two alignments by metre gauge would be approximately as shown above. The cost per mile as shown on the above table may be compared with the payments made by the Turkish Government to the Bagdad Bailway Company for each kilometre built, 10,764Z. in bonds per kilometie, equi'valent to about 13,600Z. in cash per mile. . ^ , i Taking first the case of the 5-foot gauge, let us assume the total cost to be 2 350 0001 for the purpose of discussion, which I would preface by disclaiming any pretence at expert knowledge. Considering the circumstances of the railway interest, sinking fund charges, and royalties to the Persian Government could scarcely be less than 200 000Z. a-year or 576Z. a-mile. This is 8’8 per cent., of which 1 allow interest at 5i per cent., sinking fund at 2j per cent., and 8 per cent, or 18,000Z. or 5Z. per mile for royalties to the Persian Government. To earn this sum gross receipts totalling something like 640,0001, or nearly 1,800Z. a-mile, must be earned-'assuming the ratio of gross receipts to net receipts to be as three is to one, roughly speaking. At an average rate of about 3d. a-ton per mile,f or 4Z. a-ton from Mobammerah to Khoremabad, about°170,000 tons must be bandied to earn this sum, the vast proportion of which must be through traffic. I ignore receipts from passenger traffic as unlikely to pay even the running expenses of passenger trains a couple of coaches attached, to a goods train will probably be all that is required for some time to come. It is difficult to see any prospect of more than half the amount of goods traffic required being available for transportation by rail for the next twenty years at ah events. The rate of 4Z. a-ton to Khoremabad may seem a high one, but it must be remembered that the Turkish duty of 1 per cent, is equivalent to a dut^ of more than 1Z. a-ton on piece goods (when additional Turkish charges are taken into account), and probably not less than 2s. a-ton on wheat. In estimating the incidents of freights, therefore, these sums should be deducted from the rates charged on the Luristan line. 11. Metre Gauge. If metre gauge vvere adopted, net receipts would have to be about 140,000Z. a-year, at the same rate, and gross receipts 120,000Z., necessitating the handling of over 100,000 tons of goods per annum. The weights of imports and exports via Kermanshah in 1910-11 were roughly as follows :— Imports Exports Total Tons. 42.000 3,000 45.000 Allowing for goods smuggled for personal property, the total probably amounts^ to over 50,000 tons. Of this quantity only 25 per cent, is for local use,^ the rest being forwarded mainly to Hamadan for distribution. The products of the Kermansha an Hamadan districts are mainly exported to Bussia at present; a railway would certain y divert them to a large extent to the south. Such exports would probably amoun a * Gross receipts of about 228L a-mile (180Z. a-kilom.) are guaranteed in the case of Bagdad Railway, f The maximum freights authorised on the Bagdad Railway are as follows: Per Kilom.

One of the disadvantages of the Luristan hne is that it would obtain very little internal goods traffic, as the Arabistan exports go south to the sea, and the requirements of the province are mainly supplied locally or from India. There is practically no exchange of commodities between this province and the rest of Persia, whereas there is a very large internal trade between Kerman- shah, Hamadan, Tabreez, Kasvin, Tehran, &amp;c., amounting to about 500,000/. per annum in the case of Hamadan. There is, therefore, reason to believe that eventually the bulk of goods transported would suffice to make a metre-gauge railway pay, since 30,000 tons of the Kermanshah imports and exports would probably be available at once, and a further 20,000 tons of exports now sent to Russia, may be expected to adopt this line, thus giving us at once half the total required to make the railway pay its way. The project, therefore, though unattractive as a commercial speculation, seems a sound one, though some sort of guarantee at first would appear inevitable. The Persian Government is obviously unable to give one : whether the situation justifies the British Government in doing so is a question beyond my competence, but I have already submitted that the railway is politically disadvantageous to us. Mr. Greenway in his letter of the 7th January, 1911, to the Foreign Office, states definitely that a Government guarantee will be necessary, because of the insecurity of the country. 12. We turn now to the question of a cart-road between Dizful and Khoremabad and Burujird. The approximate length of a cart-road via Pul-i-Kurr to Dukhtar and Madian Bud would be— Miles. From Dizful to Khoremabad .. .. .. .. .. .. 154 From Dizful to Burujird .. .. .. .. .. .. 220 A metalled read, suitable to carry heavy motor traffic, with a ruling gradient of 1 in 25 to 1 in 30, with suitable serais and post-houses, and a telegraph line alongside, is what is wanted. We shall, I think, be on the safe side in estimating the average cost of such a road at not more than 600/. a-mile all included, except the telegraph line.' 1- ' Such a road should be able to handle expeditiously, if properly organised, all the traffic likely to offer for a long time to come ; the capital involved is much less than that necessary for a railway, the prospect of it being damaged by tribesmen less, and the possible profits larger. Further discussion of this subject is not, however, germane to the present report, and I confine myself to suggesting with great respect that the possibility is one deserving of close examination at the hands of experts. (See also Part 5.) ^ The Russian native agent at Burujird, in a detailed confidential report to his consul at Kermanshah, to which I obtained access when in the former town, reported that the imports of Russian goods into Burujird (part of which were destined for Khoremabad) aggregated 52,000/. in value. Hamadan was the depot from which the needs of the district were supplied in all cases. The principal articles were (in order of importance) piece-goods, sugar, kerosene, matches, hardware, tea, and glass-ware, but the value under each category was not gi ven - There is no doubt that the sugar and kerosene were of Russian origin, and also the glass-ware, and perhaps the bulk of the hardware, but the matches m use m Burujird are Swedish and Austrian, not Russian, though imported through Russia by Russian merchants. As regards piece-goods, the vast proportions are undoubtedly or Rntish make, though Russian patterns are closely imitated. ^ Mr. Macmurray, of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Hamadan, reports on the 29th March, 1911, that “nothing competes with Manchester goods here except a white material, which comes from looms in India.” _ . . Matches, hardware, and glass-ware are commercially of little importance, and^ as things now stand, therefore, the only articles of importance which Russi&lt; 5 now supplies, and which we should furnish if the railway were built, are oil and sugar. ^ The formei will shortly be produced by the oil company at Mohammerah or Kasr-i-Shmn, but the total consumption of this product within Persia is likely to be but small for some years to come. The sugar now imported is at present almost entirely foreign, but there seems * Approximate cost of telegraph, line may be taken at not ovei 600 rupees a-mi!e.

Via Aminieh (opposite Nasiri), 174 miles. 16. Route. A reference to the map will show that there are really only three possible railway routes from Mohammerah to Dizful :— (1.) Via Aminieh and west bank of Diz. (2.) Via Kut Nahr Hashim and west bank of Diz. (3.) VH Kut Nahr Hashim and east bank of Karkheh crossing Shaur near Shush. No. (3) can be put out of court at once, owing to its greater length and the comparatively difficult country through which it would have to pass. The hills at Sab’eh (some 350 feet above plain) are represented, near the Diz by a few low gravel hills not over 60 feet high, the Tul Baiyash hills, some 2 miles broad and 250 feet high, find no counter-part near the Diz. The comparative merits of route (1) and (2) are summarised below :— (1.) Via Aminieh (Length 174 Miles). (2.) Via Kut Nahr Hashim (Length 1G4 Miles). Would afford alternative route between Ahwaz and Mohammerah in place of present river steamers, whose displacement would clear a way for utilisation of Karun waters for irrigation; the Karun irrigation scheme, however, is generally considered, apart from this, to be unprofitable, and its cost (500,0007) is so great as to make its inception impossible. Might suffer from competition of river traffic, as merchants might ship goods to Ahwaz for forwardment thence either by rail or via the Diz to Kal’eh Bandar. Local passenger and fast goods traffic, but incon siderable and probably insufficient to counter-balance loss by river competition. Would facilitate adoption of the Karkheh irrigation scheme an unambitious measure estimated to cost in the first instance 75,0007, and returning net profit 20 per cent. . Would secure all the Mohammerah-Dizful traffic and have nothing to fear from competition of river steamers, which would feed Ahwaz, Shushtar, and Ispahan as usual. Would give Arabistan a double set of communica tions (rail and river) serving separate areas, the one serving Dizful, Nahr Hashim, and Hawizeh; the other, Shushter and Ahwaz. The balance of advantage lies, I think, with the Kut Nahr Hashim route, and this the line I recommend, though I estimate for the Aminieh route, which is slightly more expensive. is17. Description of Country through ivhich Line would pass. Mohammerah-Nahr Hashim Section (86 miles). —Flat, barren, alluvial soil, not liable to flood except close to Mohammerah; floods not sufficiently serious to demand ^pcing embankments with stone ; only 6 inches to 1 foot of water, and only for a few weeks. ^ Little sand; no stone; practically no nalas or surface drainage channels. No vegetation. Abater obtainable anywhere 15 feet to 20 feet by digging. Kut Nahr Hashim is 250 feet above sea, giving an average gradient from Mohammerah to Nahr Hashim of about 1 in 2,000. Nahr Hashim—Shaur Hirer (16 miles). —Gently undulating ground; low ridges of soft rock widely can generally be avoided, or cut through at low pass. Slopes ground to north still almost imperceptible. No drainage channels or nalas worthy of note. No permanent habitations. Sandhills frequent, but stationary, and offering no obstacle. Stone from hills not good enough for use as ballast, has about the same consistency as half-burnt brick, crumbles rapidly. Shaur must be bridged, see below. Shaur-Shush (550 feet; 45 miles). —Up to within 10 miles of Shush line follows west bank of Diz. Alluvial soil; no sand or stones; plentiful brushwood. 10 miles south of Shush grand hills, about 60 feet high and mile in breath, are encountered; these offer no difficulty whatever, and will be valuable source of gravel for ballast. The line would probably leave Shush 2 miles to the west. Shush-Dizful (680 feet; 18 miles). —Over flat and, near Dizful, stony ground. Excellent ballast available from pebbles and boulders in Diz and Bala Bud. Two branches of Bala Bud to be crossed ; see below. Irrigated cultivation in many places. 18. Bridging. Khaz'alieh Canal behind Mohammerah. —Thirty-feet bridge necessary; 12 feet above ground. Shaur Hirer. —This a mere ditch ; as it takes its rise level from springs near Shush, it is subject only to local floods. A 50-foot span resting on masonry buttresses on either bank should be ample. Alluvial soil. North of the Shaur for two miles the ground is subject to flood from marshes by the Kharur nala; pitching of stone or bricks will be required, and one or two culverts. Bala Hud. —Two branches to be crossed; river bottom and subsoil gravel; river changes its bed from time to time, unless trained; dry in summer; floods to 5 feet or 6 feet in spring, but not more. At certain points the bed of the stream is well defined ; at such points the breath of water at flood level is about 35 yards, normal spring level 20 yards. A bridge composed of three 60-foot spans, resting on masonry pillars would probably be economical. The above applies equally to both branches. 19. Local Labour. The labour obtainable in Arabistan is of two kinds, Arab and Persian. The Arab, however, is too well off to be under the necessity of working with the spade for 2 krans (9d.) a day, and is constitutionally unfitted for regular and strenuous work. The experience of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is that it is mainly upon Persian labour that reliance must be placed, but they have had no difficulty in obtaining 1,000 Arabs for work near Mohammerah. In Ahwaz and elsewhere in Arabistan, Persian (Lur) labourers are plentiful and fairly satisfactory. Usual pay 2 krans a day ( 9 d.). Dizful labour is above the average, as it includes many skilled cultivators. Excavation is usually performed by basket and spade. The spade used locally is of a special long-handed type, but the experience of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is that Lurs adapt themselves readily to the European pattern shovel and pick. The French scientific mission at Shush have had the same experience ; they use light rails and trucks for removing spoil with good results, the Lur takes to them readily, long handed spades are, however, much used. Lurs, and also Arabs, work best in gangs under their own chiefs; unless some such arrangement is made, they are apt to get out of hand, but they are, on the whole, easily handled and amenable to mild discipline. Good bricklayers and masons are available in Dizful. 20. Gauge. The gauge of Bussian railways in the Caucasus (5 feet) would probably be chosen by the Bussiu n Government for the north section of the Julfa—Mohammerah Bail way.16 1 II 1 and would presumably be accepted by us, as we could oppose no valid argument to its adoption. A metre-gauge railway would, however, probably sumce lor all probable requirements of traffic for many years to come, and would be, on financial grounds, in every way preferable. 21. Gradients. * Practically flat the whole way, the hills at Nahr Hashim and south of Shush could be negotiated quite comfortably with 1 in 350 to 1 m 400. 22. Stations. Mohammerah .—The terminus at Mohammerah would of course be carefully designed to admit of subsequent enlargement. The site I suggest is on the Shatt-el-Arab above the customs. It has a frontage directly opposite the accepted anchorage on the Shatt- gP^rab, from which it would be easy to throw out pieis, the customs-house i&amp; Sab’eJi. —A second station, or wayside halt at Sab’eh seems called for primarily in order to give facilities for water which can be obtained here from the Karun. Nahr Hashim. —A station here would serve Hawizeh, and eventually, should irrigation be undertaken, the Nahr Hashim district. A atei obtainable from Karkheh. ^ Bizful The station would be on west bank of Diz opposite town. The abandoned Government house on west bank of Diz (Kushk) might well be utilised in this connection. Provision for its occupation by the railway as storehouse, quarters for staff, &amp;c., might be made in the concession. Water from Diz. 23. Fuel. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s refinery at Braim, 5 miles from Mohammerah, is conveniently situated to supply oil fuel in any quantity, and it will be unnecessary to&gt; import coal.’ The engines on the Bussian section of the line will be doubtless fitted to burn oil, and it is fortunate that the southern section should be not less favourably situated in this respect. . . In the Kuilab district, 48 miles off Dizful,_ there are certain pitch springs, indicating, possibly, the existence of oil in paying quantities. Were a railway through Luristanto be opened, it is possible that the Oil Company would bore for oil there, as also at Tang- i-Haleh near Madian Pvud in Luristan. 24. Estimated Cost of Mohammerah-Dizful Section. Sir William Willcocks has estimated the approximate cost of construction and equipping a railway of 4 ft. 8|- in. gauge in Arabistan at about 3,000/. a-mile. Tins corresponds closely with Mr. W. A. John’s estimate (for Seistan railways) of 50,000 rupees a-mile for “ surface line” 5 ft. 6 in. gauge. Taking the latter figur 0 , A 16 cost of this section would, vi4 Aminieh, be 87,00,000 rupees. Sir William Willccxys quoted his figure as an outside estimate. The total cost inclusive of special works is estimated at 633,333/. (vide paragraph 18). For metre gauge the cost should not exceed 500,000/. 25. Local Traffic. Dizful-Mohammerah. —Imports from Mohammerah and Amarah into Dizful are not large, probably not over 1,000 tons per annum. Exports are even smaller, owing to lack of communications. The existence of a railway would afford a stimulus o agriculture, and the exports of grain, reeds for pens, oil seeds, cotton, wool, gu m &gt; galls, &amp;c., would rapidly increase and might reach a total of 10,000 tons by the en o the third year. It is not probable that the railway, even were it to touch the Karun opposi e Ahwaz, would be able to secure an appreciable proportion of the imports and expor s which are now transported by steamer between Ahwaz and Mohammerah, and foi war e from Nasiri to Ispahan by mules. It seems certain, therefore, that the river steamers will always be in a P 0S1 . ^ ? n this river, so long as it is not utilised for irrigation, to compete successfully wi 0 railway. # u tt to The necessity of transporting goods brought up by railway across the Jlarun Basin from Aminieh, the railway station on the opposite bank, a process mvo vmgdouble handling, would make shippers unwilling to use the line, particularly as the ocean going steamers can now unload straight into barges which are towed up to Nasiri without breaking bulk, and are passed through the customs there instead of at Mohammerah. Other Local Traffic. — Hawizeh may be expected to give 200 to 300 tons imports and 1,000 to 1,500 exports; this figure would probably be doubled in three years after the railway was in working order. 26. Beason why Mohammerah and not Ahwaz should he Terminus of the Bailway. A brief note on this point seems necessary owing to the persistent public advocacy of Ahwaz as the terminus of this line by Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, who, as managing director of the “Euphratus” and “Tigris” Steam Navigation Company, presumably views with concern the possibility of competition by the railway between Ahwaz and Mohammerah with his steamers on the Karun. The Ahwaz-Mohammerah line will be cheaper ; the river boat service is slow, and uncertain, owing to shoals, dust-storms, &amp;c. Landing facilities for cargo at Aminieh would be difficult, owing to shoals in river, which frequently changes its main channel. The river boat service, unless a very large increase of traffic took place, could not run more than two boats a-week; and goods and passengers would run the risk of waiting three or four days at Mohammerah, if not more. The interposition of a river steamer service would involve two, if not more, additional handlings of the goods, involving expense and risk of breakage which is a heavy item in this country. 27. Beasons why Shushter should not he touched hy the Bailway. (1.) It would add about 20 miles to the length of the railway. (2.) It would involve the construction of three large bridges on the Karun and its tributaries, and several minor ones, thus adding greatly to the cost of the line ; the alignment via Shushter would, moreover, independently of the necessary hi nlges, be considerably more expensive per mile than that via Dizfuh (3.) It would involve negotiations with the Bakhtiari Khans in respect of the Shushter-Dizful section, and with the Shushteris in regard to the Band-i-Kir-Shushter section; both are difficult to deal with, particularly the latter. (4.) Shushter is a decaying town, and would be so to a greater degree but for the fact that at present it serves as a depot for Dizful. Its needs are sufficiently supplied by the steamer service on the Upper Karun. The town is, however, mentioned in the Shah’s rescript referred to above, on the subject of railway concessions, and it appears in the British note to Persia on the subject. 28. Time required for Construction of Mohammerah-Dizful Bailway. Since construction could be started at half-a-dozen points without inconvenience (communication by river extending to within town of Dizful, close to the line of railway), the rate of construction will depend chiefly upon the amount of labour employed. icre would seem no reason why the line should not be completed within two years from date of commencement of actual operations. . Labour is plentiful, work can go on all the year round, and as far as this section is concerned, practically nothing is needed but the simplest earthwork, and not muc i ° f Any concession for such a railway from the Persian Government should include the right to run steam- or motor-boats and barges on the Diz and Uppei Karun 01 le purpose of transporting material, &amp;c. 29. Persian Gulf Terminus: Reasons why Mohammerah and not Khar Musa should he selected* The navigation of Khor Musa is not without danger, owing to the Ummul Siswan and Ummul Dibab rocks. It is destitute of fresh water, which could only be brought with great difficulty from near Fallahieh or Buzieh, 40 miles distant The whole land for many miles round and inland is flooded twice daily at high tide, and fai t er * The terms of our application of March 31, 1911, for a railway option were “ for a port at Khor Musa and for a railway northwards as far as Khoremabad, with a branch to Mohammerah if found desirab . [2150 X —4 F18 north lie great marshes, impassable on loot for eight months in the year, extending half way to Ahwaz. No measures could ever make Khor Musa a habitable port, in my belief, and were the railway to be brought down to the coast at this spot, the vast proportion of goods traffic would still find an outlet from Mohammerah, the Kanin Kiver steamers being used between Mohammerah and Ahwaz and vice versa. It goes without saying that no passengers would ever want to go to Khor Musa, and receipts under this head would he negligible. The climate of Mohammerah in summer leaves much to be desired, in spite of the amenities afforded by ice, fruit, and fresh vegetables in plenty ; but that of Khor Musa is trying to a degree which only those who have visited it (as I have) on several occasions during the summer months, can realise. The muddy shore into which the feet sink ankle deep at every step, is impregnated with salt, and becomes so hot that no native can walk barefoot on it; and for a European thick boots alone can save him from acute discomfort. Stinging gnats and flies from the adjacent marshes swarm by night, and would make sleep impossible were it not for the fatigue caused by the long sweltering day. Hot winds blow by night as well as by day. Every consideration, I submit, points to Mohammerah and not Khor Musa as the proper terminus, and I have worked on this assumption throughout. I quite realise, of course, that it is desirable for us to have a blocking option, irrespective of Khor Musa, for political and strategical reasons. |t 30. Position of Sheikh of Mohammerah in regard to Bailway in Arabistan. The Sheikh of Mohammerah may be expected, in view of his close relations with the British Government, to co-operate with the latter in any scheme proposed by them for a railway through his territories. As the chief of a hegemony of all the Arab tribes in Arabistan, and responsible for their attitude to the Persian Government, it is upon him that we must rely to maintain order and prevent tribal animosities from impeding the progress of operations ; the experience of ten years shows that he will not fail to do so. But his position as landowner must also be borne in mind. He holds farmans granting to him, among other districts, that of Mohammerah, which extends up to the west bank of the Katun, to a point a few miles north of Sab’eh. From this point to Shush, 15 miles south of Dizful, the proposed alignment passes through the following districts, all of which are claimed, under farmans of the Shah by the present Nizam-es-Saltaneh,nephew 7 of the late Husain Kuli Khan, Nizam-es-Saltaneh, to whom they were originally granted. They are all leased to Sheikh Khaz’al:— !8pid CO f krgeew treat ^ ar 6 Ihep Itm rritl less] (1.) Karun west bank. (2.) Kut Nahr Hashim. (3.) ’Anafijeh. (4.) Hussainabad. It would probably be easy to obtain unirrigated land free of cost, and thus reduce the cost of acquisition of land to a small figure, as the railway would pass through irrigated land only at the terminus, Mohammerah, and near Dizful. Were it decided to commence construction of this line the first step would be to conclude an agreement with the sheikh by wffiich he undertook responsibility for the safety of tne line, and granted the necessary land at a fixed price. The Nizam-es- Saltaneh might be left to put in his claim for compensation in respect of the cultivated lands or the lands intermittently cultivated which have been appropriated for the use of the railway and which he may claim as his own. The lands in the neighbourhood of Shush belonging to the Nizam, have been leased to a Russian subject for twenty-five years, but he is not likely to be in a position to raise serious difficulties, and his lands could be avoided if necessary by keeping west of the Shaur till Shush w r as passed, or by keeping east of the Diz, crossing it again near Dizful. 31. Possible Tribal Opposition outside Sheikh’s Territories. I think it improbable that any serious opposition to the construction of the line, or of any serious attempt to interfere with it wffien constructed, would be experienced. A hundred armed men supplied by the sheikh would be ample to protect the camps from occasional raiding parties of trans-frontier Arabs, and the Persian Government could be induced to consent to the employment of pioneers from India, their double role of workmen and soldiers would stand them in good stead and probably greatly facilitate fen welt «of tli tie idea, Heim ‘Fro Ns or ienltof Went!

Moreover, their position and duties as pioneers would conceal to a large extent their military role and enable their services to be utilised without causing great alarm to the Jrersian Government. &amp; The presence of Lur tribes, mainly Sagwand, in the neighbourhood of Shush and Dizful » ght cause some slight difficulty but these tribes take readily to manual labour and 3 advent of the railway, with the consequent demand for unskilled labour would be welcome to them. In any case, the support of their chiefs could be obtained without great expense. 32. Total Cost of Arabistan Section. Adopting the Aminieh alignment for the purpose of my estimate, and assuming broad gauge to be desired, as elsewhere, I deduce the following estimate of cost &amp; 174 miles surface line,” at 50,000 rupees a-mile Special works— (1.) Mohammerah terminus wharf. &amp;c. .. (2.) Aminirh ferry service, wharves, tramway above rapids, &amp;c. (3.)

Special works ( 2 ) and (3) require some explanation. If Nasiri is to be served by the railway, some provision must be made for a ferry service and proper landing places on either side of the river. Provision must also be made for a light tramway, or slidings, connecting the Aminieh station with some convenient point above the rapids whereby goods can be transferred direct to steamers on the Upper Karun. The repairs of the Dizful bridge is a most necessary undertaking, in order to ensure traffic between the railway and the town being uninterrupted, and attended with less peril than is now the case, the centre span being unfenced and very rickety. Part III.— Djzftjl-Khoremabad Portiox of Alignment 33. Alignment of the Railway through Luristan. We must now consider the alignment of the railway through Luristan, it being assumed that Dizful is the point of departure in the south, and Burujird the objective in the north. The limits within which an alignment for a railway between these two places must be sought are, broadly speaking, the Dizful-Kiyalan Dalich-Khoremabad— Zagheh-Burujird route to the east, and the Kafeh Saidmarreh-Gulgul-Dureh— Khoremabad-Bairarwand-Burujird route on the west. There is a general consensus of opinion, with which I am in full agreement, that east of the Kiyalan route no practicable alignment even for a mule track can be found ; the idea, which has been prominently mooted in the public press, of selecting an alignment via the Ab-i-Diz valley must therefore be dismissed at once as impracticable. Sir Henry Bawlinson (1844) writes of it from personal experience as follows :— “ From the Tang-i-Bah rain (south-east of Burujird) the Dizful Biveribrces it way through a succession of chasms and gorges, and the track along its bank is utterly impracticable. Indeed, this part of the Zagros is so very precipitous that there is only one single pathway conducting across it from Dizful to Burujird; it is followed by nomads on foot ; it is not to be traversed by a horseman, and is considered the most difficult of all mountain pathways. It breaks into the Sahra-i-Lur (north of Dizful) between the hill forts of Tangawan and Kal’eh-i-Shahi.” Major Bell (1884) and Major Sawyer (1889) (the latter surveyed much of the district) confirm these conclusions, as also does M. de Morgan (1891) from personal experience (p. 167, vol. ii). On the other hand, the adoption of any alignment west of the Saidmarreh-Kuh-i- Dasht line would increase the length of the railway out of all proportion to any economy that might be secured thereby; and in any case I am satisfied that the Saidmarreh-Kuh-i-Dasht or else the Khasgan gorge route is the easiest that can be20 found Mention should perhaps be made of a possible route via the eastern branch of the Ab-i-Diz (through Baznawi), but even were this branch not put out of court by reason of its greater length, Major Sawyer’s verdict is against it. « rpp e leve j Y ’ weT road, which is said to have passed through this gap, and traces of which may he seen at Baznawi, may be considered to have been an old world roi# before the more modern gap of Khoremabad was brought into use. The latter is, perhaps better suited for the demands of the immediate future; for though it has the comparative drawback of being on a higher level than the river course of the Ab-i-Buruiird, for instance, the latter might, owing to its numerous gorges and precipitous hanks, require greater initial expenses to receive a civilised road or rail. * This condemnation applies equally to both branches of the Diz above DizM Acting upon these premises, I first of all examined the country east of the Kashgan with a view to finding a suitable alignment; dissatisfied with the result which worked out as will be seen later on, at over 12,000Z. a-mile, for 184 miles, I proceeded to investigate the country west of the Kashgan Biver, and found a much better align ment, estimated at 185 miles at about 9,100Z a-mile. . 34 The first “ruling point” which any alignment must necessarily touch is the Ah-i-Zal where it traverses the plain of Kal’eh-i-Kiza. This can be reached from Dizful vk Kali-i-Nai or Kafeh-i-Husainieh. The former route is shorter but more difficult : it traverses no great elevation, Kal-i-Nai (1,700 feet) being the highest point touched hut from Dukuh onwards for practically the whole of its length it crosses a succession of low ridges separated by ravines often from 50 to 100 feet deep, and a railway would involve alternate deep cuttings, lofty embankments, and bridges ; the lengths of “ surface ” line being not more than 2 miles between Dukuh and the Eaza Plam i recommend the Kaleh-Husainieh alignment therefore, and will proceed to describe its general features. 35. First Section: Dizful (700 feet), Dukuh (900 feet), 12 miles. A gentle rise of 20 to 30 feet per mile throughout, increasing slightly near Dukuh. Bor the first 6 miles, as far as Salihabad, undulating well-cultivated ground, cultivated in places. Numerous small irrigation canals near Salihabad, The formation is comdomerate, with a thin covering of soil or debris from the Bala Bud and Kuh-i- Tangawan. From Salihabad onwards the ground is^ stony, and the line suggested crosses many small watercourses, dry except immediately after rain, bringing down quantities of debris from the hills. The best alignment, I should say, would pass the ancient tanks known as Do Hauzan, and wxmld enter the low hills at Dukuh, about 3 miles east of the Bala Bud. _ . r „ Cost. —This section may be classed, following Mr. John’s estimate, as “ easy line at 90.000 rupees a-mile for 6 miles, “ surface line ” at 50,000 rupees for 6 miles; total, 840.000 rupees. Small culverts and revetments will frequently be necessary, ballast everywhere available; embankments will be expensive where necessary, as tfi er ® 18 little soil, the ground being mainly boulders and gravel. Building stone is not available ; bricks will be cheaper and easily available (of square tile shape) in Dizful. 36. Second Section: Dukuh (900 feet), to KaVeh-i-Riza (1550 feet), 23 miles. (Approximate along proposed Alignment.) Major Bell (1884), a propos of cart-road construction, remarked of this section that “ the amount of roadmaking to be done, zigzagging in and out of ravines, between a few miles south of Kal’eh-Husainieh (1,150 feet) and the Bidrubed plain will exceed that in any equal distance between Dizful and Khoremabad.” Between these points the track winds its way amongst intricate hills, of no great elevation, composed of sandstones topped with a hard conglomerate in places; it constantly crosses ravines from 50 to 100 feet in depth. Without a detailed survey o this section it is impossible to suggest any particular alignment. I satisfied mysei, however, by a bird’s-eye view from Bard-i-Balleh and other points, that it cannot be * “ Reconnaissance in Bakhtiari Country, South-West Persia, 1891,” Part I, p. 13.circumvented. Three ravines about 100 feet deep are crossed, and about twenty smaller ones averaging 50 feet. From Bidrubeb onwards to KaVeh Biza (3 miles) the alignment should present no difficulties ; by keeping north of the present track, not far from the foot of the limestone hills to the north, there should be no difficulty in Obtaining a good though costly alignment of, say, 1 in 75 to 1 in 100. The Bala Bud must be bridged somewhere between Dukuh and Kafeh-Husainieh. The average breadth of the ravine in which it runs is about 300 feet at bottom and about 60 feet deep. The whole section will be a difficult and expensive one to survey and to construct. No great difficulty is to be anticipated in regard to the gradient, as the route rises steadily from Dukuh to KaTeh-Husainieh (1,150 feet), with an average slope of 30 to 40 feet to the mile. No difficulty should be thus experienced in obtaining a gradient of 1 in 1 00, though heavy cutting and embanking, and bridges of some height, must be looked for throughout. By increasing the ruling gradient to 1 in 50 some saving would no doubt accrue, but it would convert the railway into a switchback, so narrow in section are the ridges to be traversed. I do not think tunnelling could be usefully resorted to at any point. Between Kafeh-Husainieh (1,150 feet) and Kal’eh Biza (1,550 feet), 14 miles, the highest point that the railway would have to traverse is about 1,700 feet, 4 miles from Kal’eh Biza. Cost —Considering the section as a whole, I class it as follows :— Rupees. Medium hilly: 10 miles at 1,25,000 rupees .. .. .. .. 12,50,000 Heavy ghat: 7 ,, 1,75,000 „ .. .. .. .. 12,25,000 „ 6 „ 2,25,000 „ ., .. .. .. 13,50,000 Total 38,25,000 37. Third Section : KaVeh Biza (1,550 feet), to Ziarat Ahmad Kuchikeh (1,950 feet), 14 miles. I select Ahmad Kuchikeh as the end of this section because it is a ruling point through which any alignment must pass, being the lowest point of a saddle formed by an extension of the slopes of the Kabir Kuh across the valley; the Saidmarreh Biyer forces it way through the obstacle thus placed in its way by a deep gorge, the ravine being some 200 feet higher than the proposed alignment. Between Kal’eh Biza and Pul-i-Tang (9 miles) two alternative alignments present themselves, the first keeps to the northern side of the Kaleh Biza plain, crosses the Zal just below the point where it enters the plain, near an ancient (probably Sassanian) high level bridge or aqueduct, and keeps to the foot of the gypsum hills, crossing the Ab-i-Tirada and four large ravines till it debouches on to the gentle limestone slopes near Pul-i-Tang. The advantages of'this alignment are— 1. It does not descend below T 1,350 feet; 2. It is probably 1 mile shorter than the alternative route ; 3. It does not cross the Saidmarreh ; 4. A gradient of 1 in 100 could in all probability be obtained, though at gieat cost. Its disadvantages are— 1. Not less than six bridges of some size ; 2. Heavy cutting for about 2 miles alternatively with heavy embankments, 3. Awkward curves round gypsum spurs; ^ . 4. Hills traversed between Tirada and Pul-i-Tang are gypsum, which is rapidly corroded by water, and which blasts badly, being of very unequal consistency. The alternative alignment keeps to the south side of the Kaleh Biza plain, ciosses the Saidmarreh at 1,300 feet just below its junction with the Zal and Tirada streams , continues over the flat stony plain of Sieh Gilal, and recrosses the Saidmarreh at 9 miles near Pul-i-Tang (1,300 feet). This alignment has the following dis advantages :— 1. It reaches a level 50 feet lower than the first-mentioned line. 2. It involves two bridges across the Saidmarreh. _ 3. It involves a gradient of between 1 in 50 and 1 in 75 between Pul-i-Iang (1,300 feet) and Ziarat Ahmad Kuchikeh (1,950 feet), a rise of 450 feet having to be distributed over about 5 miles. p [2150 4] U22 A 50-foot cutting through the gypsum at Ziarat Ahmad Kuchikeh will assist matters, and a slight increase in length can be arranged for, so as to diminish the slope, but the best that can be expected is 1 in 75. There will be no difficulty in keeping an even gradient from Pul-i-Tang to Ahmad Kuchikeh, as for the whole distance the line will cross gentle limestone slopes. Its advantages are :— 1. Cheapness. I think it will be found that the cost of the two bridges is amply compensated for by the lack of heavy works elsewhere. '2. Rapidity of construction. The heavy cuttings through the gypsum hills will take a long time, as also will the bridging of the ravine. It will necessitate the following bridges :— 1. Across Saidmarreh below the Zal junction; steep but not precipitous. The river is here 150 feet to 200 feet broad; banks 60 feet to 80 feet high; bed rocky; depth unknown, probably not over 10 feet in summer ; width from bank to bank about 450 feet. 2. Across Saidmarreh, near Pul-i-Tang. The river here flows through a deep gorge 6 feet to 10 feet broad at bottom, 12 feet to 20 feet at top, but no more than 8 feet broad in places; it is bridged by a single-span stone bridge ; a bridge some 250 yards long would be necessary, but no spans need be longer than 20 feet. Gradient. —From KaTeh Riza to Saidmarreh 1 in 100 can be obtained without difficulty. From Saidmarreh to Pul-i-Tang level ; from Pul-i-Tang to Ziarat Ahmad Kuchikeh 1 in 75. Curvature. —Easy throughout. Formation of Ground. —Riza plain : Stony alluvium. Sieh Gilal: Stony alluvium. Pul-i-Tang-Ahmad Kuchikeh : Gentle limestone slopes inclining 4° to south ; no soil available ; no large ravines to cross or other awkward features. Cost. —I class this section as follows :— Rupees. Medium hilly: Riza to Pul-i-Tang, 9 miles at 1,25,000 rupees .. .. 11,25,000 Hilly: Pul-i-Tang to Ahmad Kuchikeh, medium (on rock), 5 miles at 1,50,000 rupees ... .. .. .. .. .. 7,50,000 Bridge across Saidmarreh— (1.)

Near Pul-i-Tang .. .. . . ,. .. .. 50,000 Total 20,25,000 Before passing on to the next section mention should be made of the great potentialities of the Pul-i-Tang gorge mentioned above for the generation of electric power on a large scale. 08 . Fourth Section : Ahmad Kuchiheh (1,950 feet), to Ab-i-Fani (1,500 feet), 15 miles. Ab-i-Fanp may be taken as the next ruling point beyond Ahmad Kuchikeh; its height where it joins the Saidmarreh is 1,500 feet, where it issues from the gorge through Kiyalan Kuh 1,700 feet. The distance for railway purposes maybe taken as 15 miles, from Ahmad Kuchikeh there is a steady descent down the Jauzar valley till at about 5 miles the Saidmarreh is reached at the point where it enters the long gorge, the south end of which is Pul-i-Tang, height here 1,400 feet; there is therefore a fall of 450 feet in 5 miles to be negotiated. If the line be taken along the limestone slopes between the Jauzar stream and the Saidmarreh gorge there will be no difficulty in giving an even gradient, and curvature will be easy, but it will be difficult to get a gradient much better than 1 in 60 ; 1 in 100 could be attained, but at considerable expense, by following the outlines of the foot hills of Kiyalan Kuh, only touching the 1,400 feet level near the Lailum stream, but the curves will be awkward, the length of line probably 1 mile at least greater, and the work difficult and expensive. As 1 in 50 will be unavoidable in subsequent sections, I propose the former alignment; it passes over gentle limestone slopes with no difficult features such as spurs or ravines. The next 5 miles to the Ab-i-Lailum lie along the Saidmarreh valley, near the river. I he Lailum stream can be crossed half-a-mile above its junction with the river. Height of the stream here 1,500 feet, banks 50 feet higher; width from bank to bank23 ofeoid iii to fip 11251 7.51.1 1.1.1 58,1 2(125,i lerationoi^ 300 feet; fordable; rocky bottom ; width of stream average 200 feet; water slightly bitter, not over 1 ft. 6 m. deep m summer. ° ^ From Lailum to the Fani stream, 5 miles, the best alignment seems to be close to the river; easy throughout, except at 15 miles, where there is an awkward spot ^fcabutting on the femQin&amp;rrsh . it would, involve heavy cutting As regards cost, I think this section may fairly be classed as follows Easy : 5 miles at 1,25,000 rupees ..

We have now reached the point where the alignments respectively east and west of the Kashgan River, commence to diverge. I went over the eastern alignment via Dalich and Dadabad with care, surveying it throughout. As, however, X rejected it m favour of a line along or west of the Ivashgan, it seems unnecessary to trouble Grovernment with a detailed description of it.* I will therefore confine myself to an abstract of the length and cost of this line, as estimated by me :— Total sections 1 to 4 ..

Railway gradient 1 in 50. can be hoped for in many places. Curvature difficult: 200 yards radius the best that 40. The Madian Hud Alignment, West of the Kashgan. I will now proceed to describe the alternative alignment west of the Kashgan River, to wich I turned my attention as soon as I had reached Khoremabad by the route described above. It diverges from the alignment first described at the end of the fourth section, the totals up to this point being 64 miles, costing 88,65,000 rupees. Before describing this section, I may remark that a gorge line up the Kashgan to Dureh is probably practicable, but I have not been able to go fully into the question as the Kashgan was not fordable, and the track which runs up the Kashgan valley crosses the river constantly. An alignment up the gorge, as far as I can make out, after examining it for 6 miles above Pul-i-Kurr to Dukhtar, and at Tang-i-Tir, and near Pul-i-Kalhur would be a very expensive gorge line, with fifteen or twenty bridges of 100 feet or so each over the Kashgan. We may estimate the cost at 3 lakhs a mile for 60 miles = 180 lakhs. This compares rather unfavourably with the Culgul Madian Rud alignment described below, but the possibility is well worth careful examination when the time comes. This alignment is dealt with in paragraph 46. 41. Fifth Section: Ab-i-Fani (1,400 feet), to Mouth of Tung-i-Khiradarr (2,100 feetf, 20 miles. (Approximately by Alignment along Saidmarreh and Kashgan Fivers to J aidar.) This will be a difficult and expensive section: gradient on the average easy, not more than 1 in 75. The line would follow the general line of the Saidmarreh River to where it is joined by the Kashgan, below Pul Gamishan ; thence up the Kashgan valley to the mouth of the Tang-i-Khirsdarr, within which lies the ruins of a splendid -Sassanian bridge, known as the Pul Kurr o Dukhtar or Pul Shapur. I think I shallte within the mark if I class it as “heavy ghat” at 20 miles. Total for section 5 (20 miles) Grand total (84 miles) .. If lakhs of rupees a-mile for Rupees. 35,00,000 .. 1,23,65,000 42. Sixth Section: Mouth of Tang-i-Khirsdarr (2,100 feet), to top of Tang-i-Millehdar,. on Bumishgan Plain (4,100 feet), 19 miles. This will be the most difficult piece on this alignment, for it is here that we ascend on to the Luristan plateau, a rise of 2,000 feet m 19 miW The Tang-i-Khirsdarr is accessible -from the south, it may be noted, only on foot, unless the Kashgan is fordable. There is a possibility that the alignment for a metre-gauge railway would be easier up the Tang-i-Khirsdarr and the Pam Paris valley than via Millehdar, as now doscnlDod I have submitted a separate report regarding the suitability of the former alignment for a cart road. . . The alignment, I suggest, runs along the slopes ot Kuh IVlaleh, rising steadily on a gradient of ^about 1 in 50. This hill is a saddle back ; slope of rock on southern side 15 to 20 degrees ; formation very hard limestone ; face of hill but little furrowed by water-courses, and contour lines very straight. The track will ha%e to be made by blasting and revetting the whole way. I shall I hope, be on the safe side in allowing 2 lakhs a-mile for this section. r Rupees.

Seventh Section: Top of Tung Millehdar to Kuh-i-Dasht Plain. This section traverses four low ranges of hills; the first range Daghilleh-Sidann is pierced by the Yang Jangir, through which the alignment proposed passes; the second range Madian Kuh is skirted to the east, and crossed at its lowest point about 4,500 feet. The third range K. Astan-Kalkhani is similarly circumvented at about 5,000 feet. The fourth range is pierced by the Tang Haleh and by the Madian Hud (4,150 feet at the bridge); but it will probably be cheaper to take the line via Gulgul, and pierce the fourth range by a tunnel of mile at the north end of the Kuh Dasbt plain near Chasmeh Kamir; the height of the range here is 4,700 feet, that of the spring about 4,500 feet. There is no use my suggesting any particular alignment: several alternatives readily suggest themselves to anyone on the spot. I estimate the distance that would have to be covered by the line in order to reach the south edge of the Kuh-i-Dasht plain at 20 miles of which 10 miles easy at 75,000 a-mile and 10 miles at Ij lakhs, as a good deal of blasting will be required.

Eighth Section: Kuh-i-Dasht Plain (4,500 feet), to Kashgan (3,650 feet), 35 miles. In this section we have to traverse or circumvent the Kuh-i-Guraz range, 6,000 feet high. It has a breadth of over 4 miles, and tunnelling is scarcely practicable; it can, however, be circumvented to a large extent by skirting it eastward towards the Kashgan. This involves a rise to about 5,800 feet, and thence a steady fall can be provided to the Kashgan, which would be crossed probably not far from the bridge at 3,690 feet. The anarchical conditions prevailing prevented me from examining the whole of the alignment, but I am satisfied that it is practicable.25 Distance. —Difficult to estimate, as owing to haze I was unable to triangulate satisfactorily. Across Kuh-i-Dasht Plain, 8 miles; rising from 4,300 feet to 4,700 feet skirting south slopes Kuh-i-Guraz to east to near Kashgan 12 miles; from 4,700 feet to ^5,000 feet, and thence, downwards, round east end of Kuh-i-Guraz to near Tang-i-Tir, 8 miles, and another 7 miles to some point near Pul-i-Kashgan; total 35 miles. Cost.- —The first 8 miles may be classed as u easy ” at 75,000 rupees a-mile ; the remaining 27 may be put down at not less than lakhs a mile :— Rupees. 8 miles at 75,000 rupees .. .. .. .. .. 6,00,000 ] 7 miles at 1-^ lakhs .. .. .. .. .. .. 40,50.000 Bridge across Kashgan (say) .. .. .. .. .. 1,50,000 Grand total for 158 miles .. .. .. 2,31,15,000 The last 15 miles are along rocky slopes mainly of fairly stiff shale, but with a good deal of very hard limestone in places, and heavy cuttings through the smaller spurs. It should be possible to adopt a gradient not steeper than 1 in 75. 45, Ninth Section : Kashgan (3,650 feet), to Khoremabad (4,400 feet), 27 miles. The alignment would follow the Kashgan Iliver to its junction with the Ab-i- Khoremabad, and then follow the general trend of the latter stream to the town. Various alternatives will doubtless suggest themselves when a proper survey is made, but the general alignment will remain the same. This section will present no difficulty ; the last 10 miles would be “surface” line, were it not for the numerous small bridges and culverts that will have to be constructed, and a slight embankment will be necessary to keep the slope even from terrace to terrace. The first 17 miles will be difficult to align, but should not be very expensive to construct, the hills being mainly of alluvium or shale with a little limestone.

The Kashgan Gorge Alignment (vide paragraph 40). I will now turn to another alignment, up the gorge of the Kashgan Piver from its entrance to the Jaidar Plain at Pul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar to its exit from the Khoremabad Plain at Tang-i-Tir about 40 miles north. I had contemplated traversing this gorge or valley from end to end; unfortunately, however, owing to the unprecedented snow of this year, and a late season, the river was in full flood and quite unfordable. As the track up the valley crosses the river thirty or forty times it was impossible for me to get up the gorge, and I had to content mysell by seeing what I could of it at intervals. The river winds amongst steep hills, generally ending in cliffs abutting on the bed; a big bend occurs about every 2 miles, when the river will be running on one bank or the other up against a cliff; it is then necessary to cross to the other bank which is usually flat terrace ; there is no clear view of the valley for more than three or four miles, and at several points the cliffs on both sides run down to the water, leaving only a difficult mule track which is covered when the river is in flood. At such points heavy rock cutting, revetting, and tunnelling will be necessary. The river must-be constantly crossed, involving numerous bridges. The average breadth of the river when it is not spread over the gravels, or divided into several branches, is about 200 feet: 300 feet would have to be provided as a rule, from abutment to abutment to provide for flood water. The river is liable to heavy floods, a rise of 15 feet being not unknown ; the bed uniformly gravelly; no reefs or falls as far as I know. The valley is narrow, but there is always a fairly wide stretch of river terraces on one bank or the other. Difficult as the construction of a railway up such a valley would be, the alignment is a not unattractive one. It would be possible to have an almost even slope from the Saidmarreh to Khoremabad, and the ruling gradient would probably not exceed 1 in [2150 oc —4] H26 100 at any point. Steel trestle bridges of stopk size might be used to cross the stream, and would, if I may presume to offer an opinion on such a technical point, be well suited to the country and conditions of labour and construction. 47. To estimate the cost of this gorge line, the length of which, from Tang-i-Tir to Pul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar, may be taken at 40 miles, is of course quite beyond me, even hadf I been able to traverse it from end to end. I am assured, however, on the authority of the Sardar Akram and others, the general accuracy of whose statements I have been able to check, that a mule track exists right up the gorge, and that at no point does it contract to such an extent as to form an impassable canyon. Allowing 3 lakhs a-mile for the line, including bridges, and 25 lakhs for special tunnelling (which would seem, all things considered, to be a liberal allowance) for the northern and southern ends of this valley, which I have traversed, and the centre, which I have seen from a short distance, offer no formidable obstacles to railway construction, we obtain a total of 180 lakhs. The total cost of this alignment would thus be as follows :— Sections 1 to 5, 84 miles at 65,000 rupees Kashg-an gorge, 40 miles .. Tang-i-Tir Khoremabad, 16 miles Grand total for 120 miles (= 1,871,000/., or 15,600/. a-mile.) Rupees. .. 1,23,65,000 .. 1,45,00,000 12 , 00,000 .. 2,80,65,000 48. The difference between the cost of this alignment and that via Madian is 171,000/., according to this estimate, which is a mere guess ; the saving of length is no less than 65 miles, about one quarter of the distance between Dizful and Burujird; the absence of steep gradients is an added advantage. Had I seen any chance of being able to examine this valley more closely, I would have waited for another month or two in order to do so, but the Sardar Akram, who alone could arrange for my safe conduct along this line, left for the Kermanshah district to revenge the murder of a friend of his, by plundering the guilty tribe, and simulta neously hostilities commenced between the Bairanwand and the Governor-General, making any further stay in the neighbourhood out of the question. I think it not improbable that this alignment may turn out very little more, perhaps less, expensive than that via Kuh-i-Dasht, and I would recommend that any engineer expert who may subsequently be deputed to prepare authoritative estimates and effect a regular and detailed survey of an alignment should first examine the Kashgan gorge; in order to do so, he must make his survey between June and November (the floods this year being quite abnormal), and must arrange with the Sardar Akram (whose head-quarters are at Tarhan), to provide the necessary escort which he will, no doubt, gladly do. In any case the saving in length by this route may be considered to justify some extra expenditure. Part IV. —Possible Extensions of Alignment from Khoremabad Northwards. 49. Possible Prolongation of Line from Khoremabad onwards. The easiest prolongation would undoubtedly be towards Kermanshah, distant rather more than 100 miles; the country traversed is well fitted for a railway alignment which would run parallel to the mountain ranges which run in a north-north west direction throughout Luristan. But such prolongation would be of little use towards developing British trade in Central Persia, and I assume that the prolongation contemplated is to Burujird and thence to Tehran via Hamadan or via Sultanabad and Kum. The boundary between tbe Bussian sphere of influence and the neutral zone in this region is “ a line starting from Kasr-i-Shirin, passing through Ispahan. . . . ■* Kermanshah and Burujird are thus included in the region in which Great Britain engaged not to seek concessions “ for railways, land, telegraphs, road, transport, insurance, &amp;c.,” though all concessions which existed in the region in question on the 31st August, 1907, are maintained. litThe boundary line is roughly equidistant between Khoremabad and Burujird. A prolongation by rail or motor beyond Khoremabad would presumably be possible only with the consent of the Bussian Government, who, it has been suggested, are likely eventually to view the project with hostility. Without such a prolongation, at all ^ events as far as Burujird, the utility of the line would be greatly impaired, and the volume of exports in particular would be of quite insignificant proportions. Khoremabad is a very bad distributing centre ; the local market is negligible ; the surrounding country disturbed ; traffic on the main road to Burujird greatly impeded by snow in winter; and I feel convinced that any attempt to make the town into a railway terminus will be predoomed to failure, and trade will stick to the route via Bagdad, in which town are many wholesale dealers from whom small buyers can order direct. The only practical alignment between Khoremabad and Burujird is that via Zagheh, which I will now proceed to describe in detail. 50. First Section: Khoremabad to Foot of Zagheh Pass (6,300 feet), 21 miles. A steady climb along a stream which runs from the foot of the Zagheh pass all the way to Khoremabad. A gradient of 1 in 50 is the best that can be obtained, and it is possible that at one or two points 1 in 40 may be necessary for short distances. There is little heavy blasting, but for the first 10 miles there will be about 3 miles of blasting on the side of the hills, which are composed of limestone strata, covered in places by alluvial gravels and clay. The passage of the Tang-i-Zaideh Shir will involve some heavy cutting or embanking in order to reduce the gradient, so also will the ascent from the Tajareh to the Deh Safid plain. The Darreh Daraz valley once entered, the gradient becomes easier, and the line will be cheaper to construct; it would no doubt skirt the north side of the valley, rising steadily as far as is compatible with the maintenance of the ruling gradient. I estimate the cost at Ij lakhs a mile = 3|- lakhs. 51. Zagheh Tunnel. The Zagheh pass (7,200 feet) now confronts us ; apart from the practical difficulty of carrying a railway up its steep rocky slopes and over its narrow crest, such a course would involve a long detour. There is no way of circumventing the range, and I think there is no doubt but that it must be tunnelled; from 5,600 feet on the south-western to 6,500 feet on the northern side is, as nearly as I can judge, miles through limestone rock ; water is plentiful. I have no means of estimating the cost with any approach to accuracy, but for the purposes of this report it may be put down at 50 lakhs. 52. Second Section: Across the Hu-Rud Valley from near Zagheh (6,500 feet), to above Rang-i-Razan (6,800 feet), 15 miles. From Zagheh the alignment winds down the valley of the Zagheh stream till it can turn north-east and skirt the south side of the Bud valley, crossing the stream at about 6,000 feet. It would then turn north-west and approach Bang-i-Bazan village, 6,580 feet, then circle round the village and skirt the slopes of Buh Chavireh Shah in a west-south-westerly direction, rising steadily to about 6,800 feet, when the hill narrows sufficiently to make a tunnel, in all probability, economical. There is no break in the Chavireh Shah range, which the Zagheh-Bazan road crosses at 7,200 feet, and the descent on the northern side to the Silakhor plain will be much more difficult from 7,200 feet than from 6,700 feet, the height at which I propose the northern exit of the tunnel should be fixed. I estimate this section to be 15 miles long, costing 1^ lakhs a mile = 18§ lakhs. 53. Razan Tunnel. I estimate this to be 2,000 yards long; formation limestone rock ; water plentii ’. It might enter the hill on the south side at 6,800 feet, and emergent 6,700 feet into the Bazan valley. Cost may be put down ab 30 lakhs. I see noway of dispensing with it; the pass cannot be avoided, and if the railway be carried over it to 7,200 feet, the drop of 1,500 feet to the Silakhor valley will be prohibitively steep. [2150 x —4] I28 5-1. Third Section: Razan (6,700 feet),Head of Tunnel to Plain (5,700 10 miles. If the month on the Bazari side be fixed at 6,700 feet, the drop will be 1,000 feet. The actual distance between the mouth of the tunnel and the foot of the hills being 0 less tlrcin 5 miles The sides of the Bazan valley are, on the whole, of a conformation favouiable to the construction of a railway along them, but whether the east oi west side of the valley should be selected, is a point which can be settled after a careful survey. My impression is that it will be best to take the line into the Azizabad valley, and thence skirt the hills bounding the Silakhor plain to the west, descending steadily on a gradient of 1 in 50 till the plain is reached at approximately 5,700 feet. This section will call for most careful surveys, and a high degree of engineering skill. Blasting will be necessary almost all the way, and numerous bridges across ravines will be called for in addition to many culverts. I think 3 lakhs a mile would be fair estimate of cost, giving a total for this section ol 30 lakhs. Fourth Section: Up Silakhor Valley from near Chilian Chalan to Burujird (5,700 to 5,900 feet), 20 miles. It will probably be found convenient to follow the mam road crossing the river near Chulan Chalan, and keep to the eastern side of the valley. The river bed is about 100 yards wide ; breadth of stream nominally 40 yards; depth in summer and autumn 3|- to feet; unfordable in spring ; pebbly bottom. Plain is fairly level, and not irrigated from river, but by canals or “ kanats ” from hill side ; many villages scattered over the plain, nearly all (in 1911) deserted owing to the depredation of Lur tribesmen. There would be a certain amount of embanking and a little cutting necessary if the line keeps to the eastern side of the valley, and it would be well to allow f lakhs a mile for this section, in addition to which we must allow a lakh for the bridge. Total 16 lakhs. 56. Abstract: Khoremabad to Burujird. Section 1 Zagheh Tunnel Section 2 Kazan Tunnel Section 3 Section 4 Miles.

I w~as prevented both by my instructions and by the fact that hostilities between the Governor-General and the Bairanwand tribe were in active progress, from making a survey of the country traversed by this section; but this does not, I think, affect my conclusions in any way, as we are fortunately in possession of a careful survey of this particular portion of Luristan, made in 1889 by Yusuf Sharif under the superintendence of Major Sawyer, I.A. My observations have tended to substantiate its accuracy and general reliability. _ . . 58. Burujird occupies strategetically and commercially a very important position at the head of a wide fertile valley, on the edge of the central Persian plateau.^ From its gates good roads, easily adaptable to wheels or rails, diverge in every direction, tapping the fertile districts of Silakhor Bala, Nihawand, Malayir, Kazzaz, and Irak. From Bumjird to- Kangavar Kermanshah Hamadan Tehran Ispahan Kum Kasvin Enzeli Miles Approximately. 70 126 70 270 210 160 150 28859. A Lurujird-Kangavar railway could be constructed at an average cost of about 5,000b a-mile for 80 miles, say 800,000b ; it would connect with the Bagdad— Kermanshah—Hamadan-lehran line. The ruling gradient would be about 1 in 150. ^It would pass for the whole of its length through thickly populated highly cultivated ^Pounrry, and would be a most efficient feeder line. A cart-road with a ruling gradient of 1 in 25 could be built along the same alignment for about 3,000b, the principal expense being caravanserais (six), bridges, and culverts. 60. Potentialities of the Burujird District. Minerals .—I obtained information regarding several mines reported to exist near Burujird. Gold was said to be found in one mine, and I was given a sample of the same,f which I believe, however, to be simply micaceous sand. Lead ore was said to be found in remunerative quantities, 5 farsakhs distant, the ore yields 25 per cent, of metal ; the sample I was shown seemed of very good quality.! I was told at Nihawand that a European mining expert had said that the hills of this town contained good grade copper ore, but I had no opportunity of confirming this. I was told of a place west of Burujird, called Fial, where good quality coal-beds were exposed ; the sample shown me was bituminous ; it burnt welh but has, I should say, no commercial value. I was told that petroleum oil was found in the locality, and had been collected and burnt in lamps Geologically, the distinguishing feature of the country immediately north and north-west of Burujird is that the limestone formation gives place to much c ntorted finely laminated shales, extensively mixed with veins of intrusive rocks; the formation would thus seem to be very favourable to the existence of metalliferous ores. At Khoremabad I was shown specimen of bituminous coal from the Papi country east of that town, of iron pyrites from the same locality, and of copper sulphate (zak or zagh), but these minerals occur apparently in small quantities only on the surface, and only the last-named (which is used for dyeing) is worked at all. Agricultural Produce .—Cereals : Mainly consumed locally, or exported to other parts of Persia. Opium : Mainly consumed in Persia ; some 30,000b exported. Gums, dried fruits (raisins, &amp;c.) : Steady export to Bussia, which would be diverted to south by railway. Cotton, wool : Steady export to Bussia, which would be diverted to south by railway. Part V.— Possible Alignment for a Cart-road from Dizful to Burujird. 61. I have in the previous pages suggested the possibility of a cart-road between Dizful and Burujird being preferable to a railway. For such a cart-road the Persian Transport Company holds a concession, which will expire in May 1913, unless the road is opened before that date. The one formidable obstacle which prevents it being built at once is the prevailing anarchy in Luristan ; the Amir Mufakham has, however, made a determined effort to open the road, I have little doubt that the fact of the road, being in existence, and the pressure that we could exert on the Persian Government to keep it open, would ensure eventual success. I have submitted a separate report on this subject, and will confine myself here to state briefly the alignment which I propose. 62. From Dizful to Jaidar the road would follow the general alignment proposed for the railway, caravanserais being erected at the marginally noted spots.| ^ From the Jaidar Plain through the Tang-i-Khirsdarr across the Kasbgan to^ Pul, Maidan Bud, this is the main ascent of the route, and the most expensive section, as the Kashgan must be bridged, and an entrance to the gorge blasted. I went over this route and found it well suited for a cart track, the gradients being generally moderate (1 in 25), and the expense of grading the steep portions small. From Madian Bud to Khoremabad via Chinar, Bardaghul, Dureh, and Naikash; this section was considered by Major Burton to be fit in its present condition for wheeled artillery, and it could certainly be converted into a cart-road at moderate expense. Caravanserais necessary * * Silakhor Bala, INihavand, and Kermanshah districts, f Deposited in the Bushire residency, f Kal’eh Husainieh, Kal’eh Riza, Jaozar, Ab-i-Fani, Jaidar.30 at Ali Gijan, Madian End Chinar, Bardaghul, Dureh, and Changai would again have to be rebridged near Dureh and the Khoremabad river below the town. From Khoremabad to Burujird via Zagheh and Eazan is always practicable for wheels, and little expense would be incurred except on the section between Eazan and the Silakhor valley. . ▼ This route is about 220 miles long, and I have divided it into thirteen stages ; it is said to have been used in past times by Persian artillery ; it was traversed by De Bode 1835 and Schindler 1889, and was undoubtedly a main artery of trade in Sassanian times, witness the great bridge of 1 ul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar in the Tang-i- Khirsdarr. mi I am satisfied it is the shortest practicable cart-road. The experience of the road company in South Persia is, I believe, that it does not pay to carry merchandise in carts as a rule, pack animals being cheaper. It is possible therefore that a 183 miles pack mule road from Dizful to Burujird in the Kiyalan would be of greater assistance to our trade than a 217 mile cart track, which involves greater expense and a larger staff along the road; but it may be held also that under the concession the construction of a cart-road is obligatory, the phrase “ route^ chaussde ” being used in the title, though nowhere else, according to the English translation in my possession. It should also be borne in mind that where ordinary carts might not pay, motor traffic would perhaps do so ; the employment of a Eenard train has recently been advocated on the Bandar Abbas—Kerman road for instance. Further that the transport company has hitherto found itself quite unable to arrange for a sufficient supply of mules on the road in which they are interested ; a mule road, unless well organised, would not serve the purpose of distributing British goods into the present Eussian zone, which is served by a well-organised cart-road from Easht to Hamadan.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence starting with my letter No. 26il, dated the 2nd October 1910, recommending Lieutenant Wilson's deputation to examine the possibilities of railway alignments from Dizful north wards through Luristan. The Government of India will have seen from the interesting diaries which he has furnished during his absence that his journeys have been by no means uneventful, but a combination of judgment and good fortune has brought him • No. 11, dated 2-th J„1,1911. through safely, and I now hare the honour to submit a copy of his report* for the information of higher authority. I may mention incidentally that in consider ing the Khor Musa (or Mohammerah)-Khurramabad project, as a whole, he has found it advisable to bring up to date the report on the Mohammerah- Dizful section which was forwarded to the Government of India under my No. 2642 of the 2nd October 1910. The result forms Part II of his report. 2. The supplementary tracing which I have asked him to prepare and which if laid over his map, will indicate the course of his subsidiary wander ings, will show that he has made a comprehensive examination of the tract within the limits of which a practicable alignment might conceivably fall and the result of his investigations is to confirm the priwia facie impression formed by previous travellers, e.g. Sir Thomas Gordon and Captain Lorimer, that the best alignment would be found either up, or to the west of, the Kashgan valley. The full details which are furnished in Part III of the present report, in regard to both alternatives, will, it is hoped, enable railway experts to arrive at definite conclusions as to the practicability and probable cost of a railway through this piece of country which, on the gounds explained by him, Lieuten ant Wilson is convinced is the only one which can be regarded as reasonably practicable. For the cheaper of the two alignments, taking the distance from Mohammerah to Lizful as 174 miles and from Lizful to Khurramabad as 185 miles—total 359— he estimates that the cost per mile will work out to £6,395 for the 5' 0' gauge and £1,460 for a metre gauge line, and favours the latter alternative. 3. In the course of his deputation Lieuenant Wilson has incidentally given much thought to other aspects of the contemplated railway than the purely practical one, and in Part I of his report he endeavours to marshal the principal general and political considerations affecting the project considered both inde pendently and in their bearing on the Gulf section of the Baghdad Bailway, as they now present themselves to his mind. The trend of his arguments on the whole is in favour of a rest on our oars for the present in regard to the pushing of the project, at all events iu respect of the section from Dizful onwards. 4. The salient points of his observations appear to me to be these :— (i) In the course of his return journey he passed through Baghdad, and had the advantage of discussing recent developments with Mr. Lorimer, who had just returned from Constantinople. As the result of their deliberations he is convinced that the construction of the Baghdad-Gulf section is essential to the preservation of our interests in Baghdad itself and in Mesopotamia generally, and further that it would be premature to despair of our ultimately obtaining a predominant part in the management of the Gulf section. * (ii) That in any case the Baghdad-Basrah connection will pay even if deprived of the Persian trade which may be deflected to the2 Resident to Foreign, No. 1254 , dated 14 th May 1911 . Resident to Minister, No. 1253 - 42 , dated 14 th May 1911 . Mohammerah line, and that consequently the building of the latter line, though it may delay the construction and reduce the profits of the other, will not prevent its eventual completion. He doubts, therefore, whether the Mohammerah line will prove, except temporarily, to possess so much competitive or political advantage as is at present supposed. He is inclined to share the apprehension which the Shaikh of Mohammerah recently ex pressed, that the piercing of the Luristan “ buffer ” may have the effect of destroying the territorial isolation of Arabistan, to which, combined with our consistent support, Sir Khaz’al Khan, in a great measure, owes the present strength of his position. This apprehension would be accentuated if the line were made international, (i?;) He thinks that owing to the chronically disturbed state of Luristan, we may find overselves obliged to intervene to protect the line. The foregoing and other, minor, considerations bring him to the view that no action should be taken by us beyond Dizful unless the German or Turkish attitude in regard to the Gulf section of the Baghdad Railway forces it upon us ; and that from Dizful northwards we should rely for the present on our road concession to maintain the commercial interests which we now possess in the markets focussing at Hamadan. 5. I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by my discuss ing in detail the many points raised in his report, especially as there is, in regard to several of them, scope for wide difference of view, or even for the use of the same facts for argument in an opposite direction. On the whole, the conclu sions to which Lieutenant Wilson is led, bring us to a position which speaking, * No. 45-226 to Hi. M.jerty’s Minister, of which a broadly, does not differ greatly from that copy was forwarded to the Foreign Department with indicated in Sir George Barclay’s telegram my letter No. 730 of 19th March lull. No&gt; gg of ^ ^ ebmar y t 0 the Foreign Office and in my telegram of the 17th March.* There are certain aspects of the question, however, on which I venture to touch briefly. 6. Firstly, I would observe that we seem warranted in considering that tbe strong disapproval with which the announcement of our application for an option or concession to construct this line was received in Russian and German quarters, is in itself prima facie evidence of the value of the project to us, both as a means of safeguarding the commercial interests which we already possess in the region of which Hamadan is the centre, and as a lever for obtaining satisfactory terms in regard to the Gulf section of the Baghdad Railway. 7. 7 he apprehensions of the Shaikh of Mohammerah .— I am inclined to doubt if the grounds for them are so serious as the Shaikh and Lieutenant Wilson anticipate. I presume in this connection that we should take all possible steps to safeguard the Shaikh’s interests ; and in any case, the connection of Tehran by rail with Kermanshah, and of Mohammerah with Dizful, would inevit ably make Mohammerah more accessible from Tehran than now, and I doubt whether the mere ability of a Persian regiment to cross Luristan would greatly alter the position, as far as the Shaikh is concerned. From a financial point of view, the latter could not fail to benefit greatly from the construction of the line. As it is, tbe Customs revenue has greatly increased since he resigned it to the Central Government ten years ago, in return for an annuity which then represented a much larger percentage of the receipts than it does now, and should a further development of Mohammerah as a port of entry take place, he would certainly he entitled to our support in pressing for a substantial increase of his present compensatory allowance. 8. The value of the Khor Musa outlet for the Railway .—Lieutenant Wilson’s somewhat pessimistic views of the possibilities of Khor Musa as acommercial terminus do not take into account its strategical advantages and Enclosure to Government of India in the Foreign geneially differ a good deal from tlw3 COn- department, Secret-External, No. 71, dated 24th elusions arrived at by His Majesty’s Naval arc lJ04, Authorities when the locality was examin ed in 1904 —vide the papers marginally cited, to which I heg reference. 9.

Whether or not this view can be strictly maintained in theory, it is a fact that we have more than once in recent years made effective use of it in practice, and our special position has, I submit received tacit recognition. I may instance our negotiations with the Nether lands Government in regard to the Dutch option for an irrigation concession on t Vide sub-enciosure 3 to Embassy despatch the Kaiun, and our frank communication No. 402 , dated 2 ist June 1910 , to His Majesty’s to the Turkish authorities in connection Foreign Office. with the Zain incident!. 10. Turning to the present aspect of the Railway question as indicated by the refusal of the Government of the day in Tehran to accede to our application for an option, I venture in conclusion to offer the following suggestion :— That we should forthwith secure a lease from the Shaikh of Mohammerah of the shores and islets of the Khor Musa. These are a recognised part of the Pallahiyeh district which was granted to him by Royal Farman in January 1903. ride enclosure to despatch No. 50-1916 of July Th ® Shaikh would be in precisely the same 16th, 1910, to Hia Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, and position iU respect Of a lease of it HS he India! 917 of same date t0 the Goverument of was in the case of the Oil Company’s site on Abadan, of which his ownership is covered by a Farman in exactly similar terms. If any action in this direction were decided upon, it would be important to put through the necessary preliminaries, such as an unobtrusive examination of sites, with as little delay as possible. The possibility in the last resort of preventing a concession going to other parties by inducing the Shaikh to demand one himself, is a contingency which will not perhaps be lest sight of, but which it seems premature in the absence of fresh developments to do more than adumbrate here. No. 11 , dated Busbire, the 25th July 1911. From— Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, on Special Duty, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to submit herewith my report on the proposed Moham- mera -Khuiramabad Railway, which I take the liberty to summarize briefly 2. I estimate the cost of the whole line to be about £2,335,000 from Mohammerah to Khurramabad, equivalent to about £6,4S0 a mile for 360 mfles, on a ruing gradient of 1 in 50. The above figures are for Russian ^ metre gauge the approximate cost would, I believe, be £l,650 t 000.4 3. I believe the project to have a fair prospect of commercial success were metre gauge to be adopted, though there seems even then to be no likelihood of it being worth while for any British company to build it without a guarantee from the British or Persian Government. 4. On the general question of its effect on British strategical, political and commercial interests, I express, with the greatest deference, my belief that our strategical position vis a vis Russia will not be substantially altered by the railway, if built, but I regard its probable effect on our political interests in the Gulf and in south-west Persia generally with some apprehension. The tendency of the railway will be to weaken the autonomous position of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, thus paving the way for a recrudescence in Arabistan of the anarchy which reigns supreme every where else in Persia, and which so handi capped our commerce in the years 1889-1895 between the opening ofthe Karun and the accession of the present Shaikh. 5. Its inception will make the construction of railways in the north by Russia, and the continuation of the Khanikin line to Kermanshah inevitable, if indeed this is not already the case, though of course the converse of the proposition equally holds good. Since the Persian Government, as far as we can see, are not likely to he able to govern Luristan more effectively during the next decade than they have done in the past two centuries, we must face the contingency of being called upon to take our own measures for the protection of the line at some future time : the Lur tribes are not at all formidable enemies, in my opinion, but the possibility of being called upon to guard such a long line of railway will be a considerable addition to our commitments in this part of Persia, without, it seems to me, any commensurate gain to our commerce. An international expedition with the same object would be even more objectionable. The prospect of the line being placed under international control is not one that we can view with complacency ; it could scarcely fail to prejudice gravely our position in Arabistan, and would lead to complications with the Shaikh. 6. As regards the effect of the line on our commerce in Persia, I have expressed the belief that our predominance in the markets of which Hamadan is the centre will not be seriously threatened until Kermanshah is linked up with Baghdad, and that the projected Luristan line would not appreciably alter the proportion of British imports now consumed, though it should lead to a substantial increase in the quantity of goods passing through the hands of British firms and imported and exported in British ships. Its main effect would be to displace the Russian sugar and hardware now entering from the north by the produce of Germany, Prance and Austria (though imported, we may hope, by British firms) and Russian oil by the products of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but the demand in western Persia for the last-named commodity is not likely to assume importance for many years to come. 7. The effect of the proposed railway on the Baghdad Persian Gulf line would be, I believe, to deprive the latter of a considerable proportion of its up ward traffic , and impair its prospects of being financially profitable until irriga tion on a large scale is introduced into Mesopotamia, but this result will not be attained unless the line is prolonged at once to Burujird at least. I cannot believe, however, that it will for long postpone the construction of the Baghdad-Persian Gulf line, nor permanently damage its position. I am much impressed with the inadequacy of the Tigris and the importance to us of a Baghdad-Basrah railway which will place the capital of Mesopotamia in close touch with British shipping and go far to help us to retain our position in Baghdad, if honestly worked. If Baghdad is linked up with Europe but not with the Gulf (and the Tigris is no substitute fora railway for this purpose) a hundred factors will tend to alienate Mesopotamia from the principal seats of our commercial and political influence in the middle East, and a diminution of our political prestige will follow, a serious matter when it is remembered thatBaghdad is the centre of the pilgrim traffic of large Sections of the Moham medan world. The Bombay mills, moreover, are indisputably destined to find in Mesopotamia a large and increasing market for their products. 8. I submit that we should use the Mohammerah-Khurramabad option only as a lever to obtain fair terms for ourselves on the Baghdad-Persian Gulf railway, and that we should not take active steps to build it unless forced to do so by, for instance, the prospect of the right to do so being granted to others, or by failure on our part to obtain a predominant share in the Baghdad-Gulf section. In the latter contingency, I have advocated the construction of a Mobammerah-Dizful line, connected with Khurramabad and Burujird by good cart roads, for which we already have a concession, in this way securing to ourselves most of the benefits of the railway without the political risks which, it is suggested, its construction would involve. 9. The map accompaning this report is the result of a continued plane table and prismatic compass survey : the original sheets are forwarded without any adjustment or alteration : each week’s work was inked in regularly, as it was impossible to keep the work in pencil only for so long a period : the map is in consequence, I fear, unsuited to photographic reproduction, and will have to be redrawn by a draughtsman : in extenuation of my defective caligraphy I can only say that I had no tables or chairs in camp with me and no draughtsman’s apparatus : all detail on the map except south of the Kabir Kuh represents actual observations by myself, and I have not “ compiled ” any portion of it, except north of Khurramabad, where I was prohibited by my instructions from surveying. 10. Breakdown of my camera at the outset of my journey unfortunately prevented my obtaining any photographic records : the photogravures enclosed herewith are extracted from De Morgan’s “ Mission Scientifique en Perse.” 11.

General and political considerations. 1. Whilst fully realising that any decision on the part of His Majesty's Governmeut in regard to the construction of railways in south-western Persia must ultimately depend upon considerations of which I am, for the most part, ignorant, and regarding which I am not competent to express an opinion, it seems nevertheless convenient that I should preface this report on the practical aspects of the projected Luristan line by a brief summary of some of the principal general and political considerations affecting it, as far as I am aware of them. 2. The attitude of the Russian Government. —The attitude of the Russian Government to the Luristan project has undergone a notable change since 1907, and it has declared its strong dislike on commercial grounds of any railway which approaches the Russian zone from the south; whilst recognizing our right to construct the Luristan line as far as Khurramabad, Russian Foreign Ministers have been unanimous in their belief that the Russian public opinion would be strongly opposed to any action by Great Britain in such a direction. No great outcry, however, seems to have been made by the Russian press, which has shown less interest in the matter than that of Germany, and Russia has been unable to offer any valid reason for opposing us in this direction, whilst assisting Germany to join up Baghdad with Tehran. Hostile as Russia undoubtedly is to the project, it seems improbable that she will be able to press her objections so strongly as to affect materially whatever decision may be arrived at by His Majesty’s Government. Her need of British capital for railways in the north alone suffices to make her prac tically unable to offer determined diplomatic opposition to our proposals. She may, however, effectively oppose our entry into the Russian sphere by an extension of our line to Burujird, and may place obstacles in the way of any connection being made between our terminus there and Russian lines which may in the meantime have been brought down from the north : she might also hamper us by stipulating for international control, and by opposing the running of motor traffic on our roads, should we desire to initiate such between Khurramabad and Burujird, for instance, or from Burujird northwards. 3. Relation of the project to and its effect on^ the Baghdad Railway. —As long ago as 1891 M. He Morgan, Chief of the “ Delegation Scientifique en Perse ” in his published reports discussed briefly the Luristan railway project, and came to the conclusion that, as a commercial speculation, it could not bear comparison with the Baghdad*Kermanshah line, which had few physical diffi culties to contend with. From the purely commercial point of view this seems not improbable particularly when it is remembered that a Baghdad-Kermanshah line might form part of a great through route to India from Europe via Constantinople. But it will connect western Persia with the sea by a section passing wholly through Turkish territory, and having its terminus in non-Persian territory, a state of things contrary to the interests of Persia generally. On the other hand the principal shrines of the Shiah faith are close to Baghdad, and thus even the passenger traffic on the Khanikin line will be in itself a source of profit. 1 1 The number of pilgrims from Persia who pissed Khunikin in 1905 was 95 , 000 , in 1910 , 55 , 000 , accord* in' to Turkish quarantine statistics : a considerable increase may be expected as a result of railway construction on this line.As regards goods traffic : from Baghdad the stream of exports from Persia will inevitahly flow towards the Gulf in the main, and imports will follow this loute for the most part, whether the Persian Gulf Baghdad Bailway he con structed or not: it may be assumed therefore that the Baghdad-Kermanshah line will he remunerative from the first, even though it be subject to the competition of the Luristan line, which would deprive it of a considerable portion of its goods traffic, and a part of its passenger traffic. Being shorter, and for the whole of its length in Persian soil, thus avoiding Turkish dues and exactions, the Luristan line will have au initial advantage which no reasonable adjustment of rates on the Turkish line could entirely neutralize Even at present the weight of goods imported to and exported from Kermanshah via Khanikin aggregates nearly 50,000 tons. I conclude, therefore, that the Luristan line would have a markedly unfavourable but not ruinous effect on the Persian Gulf-Baghdad line, and to a much less degree on the Baghdad Bailway as a whole. Its construction might so reduce the prospective traffic on the Persian Gulf-Baghdad railway as to make it impossible for the latter to earn enough to he financially profit able for some years to come, or until irrigation on a large scale has been introduced and extended in Mesopotamia, thus robbing the line of the attrac tion to investors. I cannot, however, believe that the construction of the Luristan line will for long postpone the realization of the Baghdad-Gulf project, nor permanently damage the financial prospects of the latter; its effects are likely, however, to be sufficiently (?) to make the threat of its construction a valuable lever when negotiating with Germany or Turkey. The value of the line as a lever will be small, however, unless prolonged beyond Khurramabad to the great commercial centres of which Hamadan is the chief, or at least as far as Burujird, Prom Basrah to Baghdad by rail (350 miles) is no further than from Mohammerah to Khurramabad, and the former line will undoubtedly be cheaper to construct than the latter. I have suggested (paragraph 9) a rate of £4 a ton as the cheapest average rate we can afford to charge on goods between Mohammerah and Khurramabad. How does this compare with the actual river rates and prospective railway rates between Baghdad and Basrah ? The following tables may throw some light on the point: — Statement showing freights charged in 1910 on goods between Basrah and Baghdad and vice versa. Class. Imports. Exports. Total. Rate per ton.

The conclusion I draw from these figures is that if Khurramabad is to he the distributing centre and terminus of the Luristan line it will not be able to compete with Baghdad, which has great initial advantages oyer a sma 1 isolated town like Khurramabad. In order to fulfil its object the line must he prolonged at all events as far as Burujird. We have not given up all hope of participating in the Baghdad-Basrah railway, the construction of which is of the greatest importance to us as a set-off to the Constantinople-Baghdad line, which will tend to alienate Mesopo tamia from the principal seats of our commercial and political influence m tbe Middle East. Until we are forced to abandon hope of retaining a predominant share in such a line, it would seem to be against ^ our interests to take any active steps towards the construction of a Luristan line, which is m itsei politically and perhaps strategically objectionable, and which may ultimately prejudice our interests in Mesopotamia. Even were we to pursue the scheme, however, the necessity for us to jom in building the Baghdad-Basrah line would be none the less imperative, m tiie interests of our position in Mesopotamia. Were we to build a railway from Mohatnmerah to Dizful (a line costing but little and with every prospect of paying its way at metre gau^e eventuaUy if the feeder roads to the north were built and properly organised) and to reserve to ourselves the right to extend it to Khurramabad, we should prevent any possibility of railway enterprise by other nations m this re , and at the same time retain in our hands a valuable lever to force the Turks to give us a predominant share in the Tigris Valley Railway Company when it comes to be formed. It is scarcely necessary to add that there is no point south of ^ e except Dizful which could be made a terminus of the projected line, ana ™ suggestions of the Russian Government in this connection are quite p cable.4. Attitude of the Persian Government .—The superior advantages of the Luristan railway over the Baghdad-Kermanshah propect from the point of view of the Persian Government, if the former is alternative to, and not in addition to, the latter, is so strong as to need no laboured demonstration. It is to Persia’s interest that her exports and imports should flow in channels wholly within her borders and under her control, and that all the indirect benefits following on the establishment of an important port should accrue to her and not to the Turkish Government. It is to her interest to strengthen her hold upon her South-West Provinces, and no more powerful interest than the railway now under discussion could be desired for the purpose. No alignment between the northern end of the Gulf and western Persia, by which I mean the country of which Kermanshah and Hamadan are the centres, will suit the Central Government equally well. The next best, from her point of view, would be a Mohammerah-Ispahan line, but this has been pronounced after careful expert examination by Major W. K. Morton, B.E., to present prohibitive physical obstacles to a cart road, from which it may be inferred that a railway is likewise impracticable. The rescript of Nasr-ud-Din Shah in reference to a Tehran-Shushtar railway is well known and need not be further referred to. The Persian Government may be expected, I conclude, ultimately to favour the project, though great difficulty will doubtless be met with in obtaining a concession on anything like equitable terms. It will probably be difficult to reconcile the rights of the Shaikh of Mohammerah in the matter, as guaranteed to him by us, with the claims and pretensions of the Persian Government. 5. Probable effect of proposed railway on British political, strategical and commercial interests .—On this subject the view which I respectfully submit below may be summarised by saying that the prospect is unattractive as a commercial speculation and its political disadvantages, which are ultimately largely commercial ones, outweigh, in my belief, any advantage which it may afford to our commerce in west Persia: strategically the line would appear to be of small importance to us. The arguments against the construction of a line connecting Arabistan with west Persia may be summarised as follows :— We are already strongly established in Arabistan, with sufficient security for our trade, and with every opportunity for increasing it by extension of oil works, irrigation, etc. Whilst a light railway to Dizful would undoubtedly assist the development of the province (as would also the Luristan road from Dizful to Burujird), the Karun at present provides a sufficiently good channel as far as Shushtar for local requirements, and as regards Dizful there is nothing to prevent the utilization of the Diz for that purpose to within 20 miles of that town. The Luristan line will contribute but little to the development of Arabistan (Mobammerah of course being excluded) as the agricultural products of the province must always go south, not north, by boat and not by rail, and it is from the south that the vast bulk of its needs must be supplied : if under international and not British control, the line may lead to an actual diminution of our prestige and to all sorts of compli cations with the Shaikh. Russia’s economic and political progress southwards has hitherto been checked by the Zagros mountains : if these be pierced by a railway our position in Arabistan will be weakened, and there is nothing to show that we shall obtain anything like adequate compensation in the markets of western Persia, in which British goods greatly preponderate at present, and are likely to do so at all events until Kermanshah is joined up with Baghdad. The following figures for the foreign trade of Hamadan supplied by the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia may be considered, I think, to support this contention.10 British trade* United Kingdom : piece goods, £850,000 (worth about £100 a ton). India: spices, copperware, tea, cotton yarn, thread, indigo, £180,000. Total British trade £1,030,000. Russian trade* Sugar Oil Glass, hardware, etc., Iron from Ardabil Cheap prints, etc., Germany, America and France. Drugs, woollens, fancy goods, synthetic indigo Turkey. « Skins, figs, dates ... ... Total foreign trade £ 80,000 10,000 5.000 6.000 7,000 108,000 100,000 32,000 £ 240,000 The construction of the railway would probably cause a displacement of Ttussian oil by the products of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and of Bussian sugar and hardware by the produce of Western Europe, but it seems that British trade would only benefit by the general improvement in commerce that may be expected to follow upon the construction of the line. I do not forget that it is British firms who may be expected to import sugar and hardware in displacement of Russian products, thus enabling them to increase their exports, but I do not think that the prospective profits under this head are likely to he sufficient to affect materially the situation as I have depicted it. We have built up considerable commercial interests in Arabistan under the security provided by the strong and autonomous regime of the Shaikh of Mohammerah. A railway connecting Arabistan with West Persia can scarcely fail to weaken his powers, without bringing to him or to us any counterbalancing advantage. His rent-roll will be somewhat swelled, it is true, but that will not compensate him for the destruction of the geographical isolation of his territories from the rest of Persia which will follow the construction of the railway. As for the Turks, he would sooner deal with them single-handed than with the aid of such a two-edged weapon as the armed assistance of the Persian Government. The temporary extension of the Persian Government’s influence and maleficent administrative activity to Arabistan from 1880 to 1895 was synchro nous with a period of almost continuous disorder, which so hampered British commercial enterprise in the provinces that the opening of the Karun remained for years almost without effect and our trade was nearly strangled, and is only now beginning to recover from the effects of that treatment. This state of things ceased only wTien Shaikh Khaz’al by his wuse and farseeing policy con trived to emancipate himself from the arbitrary interference of the Persian Government, patriarchically and without molestation, so long as he paid the Government revenue regularly, which he has done ever since. There is no reason whatever to suppose that an extension of the Persian Government’s facilities for interference will not have precisely the same effect in the future as in the past.The projected line will in no way meet Indian passanger traffic or mail requirements, and the advantage which it will secure to our commerce in Central Persia will presumably be neutralized to a large extent by Russian railway construction advancing pari passu from the North. The construction of the Baghdad-Kermanshah line, if we have a predominant share in the 'p Baghdad-Gulf section, will assist our commerce in an almost (?) degree and leave us relatively to Russia in much the same position we at present occupy in the markets of central Persia. Finally, it seems improbable that the Persian Government could itself permanently secure the safety of the railway if built, or even the freedom of the construction from molestation by the tribesmen : we might easily be called on to send troops to Khurramabad to protect the line from destruction, and it is not endangered thereby. International interference with the same object would be even more obnoxious to us. This objection applies, it is true, to road construction in Luristan, but in the latter case the capital involved is compara tively quite small, and the amount of damage that can be done less. 6. Such are some of the arguments which may be urged against the rail way apart from its financial aspects, which are dealt with below (paragraph 9). In favour of the line it may be urged that the Baghdad-Kermanshah fine, con nected as it is wdth Basrah by river only, is not suited to convey agricultural produce to the sea, that it will not sufficiently develop the export trade which will be hampered by transit dues, and it is upon an increased export trade that we must rely to obtain any substantial increase in the volume of our imports. It may further be said that Turkish obstruction may be counted on as a cer tainty, and that we shall in practice be unable to guarantee that freight rates will not be manipulated to our disadvantage, as in the case of the Hamburo-- Amerika line. But if these objections can be satisfactorily met, much of the necessity, from our point of view, of the Luristan line, would seem to disappear. Control of the Baghdad section should enable us to prevent differential rates on the Khanikin-Kermaushah extension. It may be pointed out that the Mohammerah line is vastly superior from the point of view of purely Persian interests, and that our oil industry in south west Persia will benefit by the line, and stress may be laid on the rapid increase of trade that will follow the construction of the railroad : this is undoubtedly a good argument, but it presupposes the restoration and mainten ance of order in south-west Persia, a consummation still far distant, specially in Luristan. To a large extent, moreover, the Baghdad-Kermanshah railway will have the same effect, at a minimum of expense and without the political and finan cial risks that, it has been suggested, a railway may involve. As regards the effect of the railway upon the Shaikh of Mohammerah, it may be held that as in the past, so in the future, he will adapt himself to altered circumstances, and, with our support, maintain his present position vis a vis the Persian Government. An investigation of this point, however, involves the, discussion of probabilities and contingencies too remote for consideration with in the limits of this report. 7. It may be urged that for strategical reasons connected with the defence of India, it is undesirable that a connection should be made by rail between Central Persia and the head of the Persian Gulf, but such considerations apply with greater force to the Trans-Persian railway, which, it is understood, has been accejded in principle by the Government of India, subject to proper safeguards. In any case, as long as we have naval predominance in the Gulf, the Luristan Railway can have little value to Russia, more particulaly if its terminus be at Mohammerah up the Shatt-al-Arab river and not at Khor Musa. It may also be argued, on the other hand, that “ the time may come when the power of rapidly moving a force to Tehran or its neighbourhood by so short a route from India may be of great advantage’* (Memorandum by Major Baird, D.S#0., dated 5th June 1907, printed by Chief of Staff’s Division, India).12 Such prospective value to us seems, however, very problematic, as also its military value to Russia, and I do not think that we need have any serious apprehensions as to the strategical effect of the line upon our position in the Gulf. My humble opinion, after weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the Luristan line, is that the best course for us would be to build the Moham- ^ merah-Dizful railway as soon as possible, and connect at once by a well-built road to Khurramabad and Burujird. From Bizful to Hamadan by road is about 250 miles, from Baghdad to Hamadan about 325. We shall, then, be able to land goods at Hamadan at all events as cheaply via Bizful as we are now able to do via Baghdad, and far more expeditiously. When the railway is completed as far as Baghdad we should then and not till then, start on the Bizful-Khurramabad section, in anticipation of the prolongation to Khanikin being built, 1 should we by this time have been forced to give up hope of controlling the Baghdad section, predominance on which would render the construction of the Luristan line, in my view, superfluous, in view of the political objections to it. It would probably be to the advantage of both ourselves and Russia to prevent railway construction in Persia for another ten years, but as Germany seems to have succeeded in compelling Russia to abandon this policy, the course I have outlined above seems to offer the fewest objections. It involves no large outlay and would probably be financially remunerative before long : it also makes no great addition to our commitments in this part of Persia. 8. Gauge of proposed railway .—We may assume that for our purposes there are three possible gauges, 5', 4'8J', and metre gauge. There would seem at first sight to be good prima facie grounds for choosing the Russian (S'O') gauge, which would facilitate the prolongation from Khurramabad to Burujird, which I believe to be essential to the success of the line, and the extensions thence to some point or points on the Russian railway from the north when it comes to be constructed. But I have submitted in the succeeding paragraph that it is only by building the line to metre gauge that we can ever hope to make it a financially sound proposition. This argument should suffice to outweigh any objection by Russia against the break of gauge, which is in itself strategically most desirable. The financial argument has the additional advantage of enabling us to put forward strong reasons for a break of gauge on the border of the neutral zone no less than on that of the British zone. The 4/8gauge, as used on the Baghdad railway, enables a high rate of speed to be attained by heavy trains, but it is financially objectionable, and would be so on strategical grounds should the Tehran-Khanikin line be built to this gauge. The 2 / 6' 1 ' gauge advocated by Sir T. E. Gordon is, I would submit, too small to be economical: it has only been adopted in India for a few hill railways of exceptional difficulty and some feeder lines in southern India. The metre gauge is much the cheapest and can he used with sharper curvature than the broader gauges : the rate of speed is slower and the maximum load that a train can carry is less. As the Luristan line is never likely to be a mail or main passenger line, the slower speed seems unimportant; and as regards the traffic it could carry, though I can profess no expert know r - ledge on the subject, I venture to record my belief that a metre gauge will be ample for the requirements of the country for the next 25 years at any rate. Putting the train-load at the low figure of 400 tons, one train a day would deal with 150,000 tons a year. This question is further dealt with in the next paragraph. Whilst considering the metre gauge for financial, and strategical reasons in every way preferable, I have nevertheless estimated for a broad gauge line, whilst adding estimates for metre gauge as far as I am able to deduce them. 9. Financial prospects of the line .—The estimates of cost of the line (5'0 gauge) are based on the same classification as that adopted by Mr. John for 1 There is, I undeistand, a possibility of the main line passing through Khanikin to Baghdad.the Baluchistan line, which provided for S'G' gauge, 62 lbs. rails, wooden sleepers, and a small quantity of rolling stock, stations, etc., on a moderate scale. Iron sleepers would, however, be undoubtedly necessary, owing to the preva lence of white ants and the temptation to theft which wooden sleepers would offer to the tribes. The details of the proposed alignments and their estimated cost will be found in Parts II and III of this report. They may be summarized as follows.—(converted into £ from Rs.). Miles. 5'0' / gauge. Metre gauge. Via Kuh-i-Dasht. £ Mohammerah-Dizful 174 633,333 &gt; ) Dizful-Khurramabad ,,, 185 1,700,000 J &gt; £6,395 per mile. £4,460 per mile.

Totals ... 314 £2,504,333 ... £1,685,000 I was unavoidably prevented by heavy floods and disturbances from examining the Kashgan gorge in detail: it is not improbable that expert examination will prove it to be no more expensive and perhaps cheaper than the Kuh-i-Dasht line, which is, according to my tentative figures, cheaper, though harder, to build, 43 miles longer and of steeper gradient. 10. On the assumption that the cost would diminish proportionately to the gauge (though I believe that it is the general experience of railway engineers that the reduction of cost is not as a rule proportionately equal to the reduction in gauge) the cost of the two alignments by metre gauge would be approximate ly as shown above. The cost per mile as shown on the above table may be compared with the payments made by the Turkish Government to the Baghdad Railway Company for each kilometre built, i.e. 3 £10,764 in bonds per kilometre, equivalent to about £13,600 in cash per mile. Taking first the case of the 5'0' gauge, let us assume the total cost to be £2,350,000 for the purpose of discussion, which I would preface by disclaiming any pretence at expert knowledge. Considering the circumstances of the railway, interest, sinking fund charges and royalties to the Persian Government could scarcely be less than £20^,000 a year or £576 a mile. This is S’S per cent of which I allow interest at 5| per cent, sinking fund at 2^ per cent and 8 per cent or £18,000 or £5 per mile for royalties to the Persian Government. To earn this sum gross receipts totalling something like £640,000 or nearly £1,800 a mile must be earned, 1 assuming the ratio of gross receipts to net receipts to be as three is to one roughly speaking. At an average rate of about ud. a ton per mile 2 or £4 a ton from Mohammerah to Khurramabad, about 170,000 tons must he handled to earn this sum, the vast proportion of which 1 2 Gross receipts of about £228 a mile (£180 a kilometre) are guaranteed in the case of Baghdad Railway. The maximum freights authorised on the Baghdad Bailway (1) General goods, hardware, piece-goods and manufactures. (2) Minerals, stone, meat, fish, preserved vegetables (3) Rice, cereals, coal, flour, fresh vegetables Cereals in bulk carried over 900 kils. ... are as follows :— 35 paras per kilo. ... 27 ... 22 ... 6 » 2&gt;'2d. per ton per mile. 2-35rf. 1-9^. 052i.

I ignore receipts from passenger traffic as unlikely to pay even the running expenses of passenger trains: a couple of coaches attached to a goods train will probably be all that is required for some time to 1 come. It is difficult to see any prospect of more than half the amount of goods traffic required being available for transportation by rail for the next twenty # years at all events. The rate of £4 a ton to Khurramabad may seem a high one, but it must be remembered that the Turkish duty of 1 per cent is equivalent to a duty of more than £1 a ton on piece-goods (when additional Turkish charges are taken into account) and probably not less than two shillings a ton on wheat: in estimating the incidence of freights, therefore, these sums should be deducted from the rates charged on the Luristan line. 11. Metre gauge —If metre gauge were adopted, net receipts would have to be about £140,000 a year, at the same rate, and gross receipts £120,000, necessitating the handling of over 100,000 tons of goods per annum. The weights of imports and exports via Kermanshah in 1910-11 were roughly as follows:— Imports ... ... ... ... ... 42,000 tons. Exports ... ... ,.. ... ... 3,000 „ Total ... 45,000 Allowing for goods smuggled for personal property, the total probably amounts to over 50,000 tons. Of this quantity only 25 per cent is for local use, the rest being forwarded mainly to Hamadan for distribution. The products of the Kermanshah and Hamadan districts are mainly exported to Russia at present: a railway would certainly divert them to a large extent to the south. Such exports would probably amount to 20,000 tons a year to begin with. One of the disadvantages of the Luristan line is that it would obtain very little internal goods traffic as the Arabistan exports go south to the sea, and the requirements of the province are mainly supplied locally or from India. There is practically no exchange of commodities between this province and the rest of Persia, whereas there is a very large internal trade between Kermanshah,’ Hamadan, Tabriz, Kasvin, Tehran, etc., amounting to about ^ million sterling per annum in the case of Hamadan. There is therefore reason to believe that, eventually, the bulk of goods transported would suffice to make a metre gauge railway pay : since 30,000 tons of the Kermanshah imports and exports would probably be available at once, and a further 20,000 tons of exports now sent to Russia may be expected to adopt this line: thus giving us at once half the total required to make the railway pay its way. The project therefore, though unattractive as a commercial speculation seems a sound one, though some sort of guarantee at first would appear inevitable: the Persian Government is obviously unable to give one: whether the situation justifies the British Government in doing so is a question beyond my competence, but I have already submitted that the railway is politically disadvantageous to us. Mr. Greenway in his letter of the 7th January 1911 to the Poreign Office states definitely that a Government guarantee will be necessary because of the insecurity of the country. 12. To turn now to the question of a cart-road between Dizful and Khurramabad and Burujird. The approximate length of a cart-road via Pul-i-Kurr Dukhtar and Madian Bud would be From Dizful to Khurramabad ... ... t &gt; 154 miles. „ to Burujird ... ... ... 220 „ A metalled road suitable to carry heavy motor traffic, with a ruling gradient of 1 in 25 to 1 in 30 with suitable serais and post-houses and a telegraph line alongside, is what is wanted.We shall, I think, he on the safe side in estimating the average cost of such a road at not more than £600 a mile all included except the telegraph Such a road should be able to handle expeditiously, if properly organized, all the traffic likely to offer for a long time to come : the capital involved is muon ess than that necessary for a railway, the prospect of it being damaged by tribesmen less, and the possible profits larger. Further discussion of this subject is not, however, germane to the present report, and I confine myself to suggesting with great respect that the possibility is one deserving of close examination at the hands of experts. (See also Part V). v The Hussian native agent in Burujird, in a detailed confidential report to his Consul at Kermanshah, to which I obtained access when in the former town, reported that the imports of Bussian goods into Burujird (a part of which were destined for Khurramabad) aggregated £52,000 in value. Hamadan was the depot from which the needs of the district were supplied in all cases. The principal articles were, (in order of importance), piece-goods, sugar, kerosene, matches, hardware, tea and glassware, but the value under each category was not given. There is no doubt that the sugar and kerosene were of Bussian origin and also^ the glassware and perhaps the bulk of the hardware, but the matches in use in Burujird are Swedish and Austrian, not Bussian, though imported through Bussia by Bussian merchants. As regards piece-goods, the vast pro portion are undoubtedly of British make, though Bussian patterns are closely imitated. Mr. Macmurray of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Hamadan, reports on the 29th March 1911, that “ nothing competes with Manchester goods here except a white material, which comes from looms in India ”. Matches, hardware and glassware are commercially of little importance and as things now stand, therefore, the only articles of importance which Bussia ntfw supplies and which we should furnish if the railway were built are oil and sugar. The former will shortly be produced by the Oil Company at Mohammerah or Kasr-i-Shirin, but the total consumption of this product within Persia is likely to be but small for some years to come. The sugar now imported is at present almost entirely foreign, but there seems good reason to hope that before long British sugar may compete successfully in this market. Piece-goods being unbreakable, compact, and of a high value relatively to their weight, are better suited to mule transport than are the other important commodities which Persia imports, and the advent of the railway will not largely improve our trade in this direction, as we supply practically the whole of Western Persia to the exclusion of Bussian imports. 1 Approximate cost of telegraph line may be taken at not over Rs. 600 a mile.PART II.

No. 3 can be put out of court at once, owing to its greater length and the comparatively difficult country through which it would have to pass. The hills at Sab’eh (some 350' above plain) are represented, near the Diz, by a few low gravel hills not over 60' high; the Tul Raiyash hills, some 2 miles broad and 250' high, find no counterpart near the Diz. The comparative merits of routes (1) and (2) are summarized below :— (1) V\&amp; Aminiyeh. (2) Vth Kut Nahr Hashim. — Length 174 miles. Would afford alternative route between Ahwaz and Mohammerah in place of present river steamers, whose displacement would clear a way for utilization of Karun waters for irrigation : the Karun irrigation scheme, how ever, is generally considered, apart from this, to be unprofitable, and its cost (£500,000) is bo great as to make its inception impossible. Might suffer from competition of river traffic, as merchants might ship goods to Ahwaz for forwardment thence either by rail or via the Diz to Qal’eh Bandar. Local passenger and fast goods traffic, but in considerable and probably insufficient to counterbalance loss by river competition. Length 164 miles. Would facilitate adoption of the Karkheh irrigation scheme, an unambitious measure estimated to cost in the first instance £75,000 and returning net profit 20 per cent. Would secure all the Mohammerah Dizful traffic and have nothing to fear from com petition of river steamers which would feed Ahwaz, Shushtar and Ispahan as usual. Would give Arabistan a double set of com munications (rail and river) serving sepa rate areas, the one serving Dizful, Nahr Hashim and Hawizeh, the other c hushtar and Ahwaz. The balance of advantage lies, I think, with the Kut Nahr Hashim route, and this is the line I recommend, though I estimate for the Aminiyeh route, which is slightly more expensive.17 17. Description of country through which line would pass. Mohammerah* Rahr Hashim section. —86 miles : flat, barren, alluvial soil, not liable to floods except close to Mohammerah : floods not sufficiently serious to demand facing embankments with stone: only 6 inches to 1 foot of water, and only for a few weeks. Little sand; no stone : practically no nallas or surface drainage channels. No vegetation. Water obtainable anywhere, 15 feet to 20 feet, by digging. Kut Nahr Hashim is 250 feet above sea, giving an average gradient from Moham merah to Naht Hashim of about 1 in 2,000. Nahr Eashim-Shaur B. —16 miles. Gently undulating ground : low ridges of soft rock which can generally be avoided, or cut through at low pass. Slope of ground to north still almost imperceptible. No drainage channels or nalas worthy of note. No permanent habitations. Sandhills frequent but stationary and offering no obstacle. Stone from hills not good enough for use as ballast, has about the same consistency as half burnt brick : crumbles rapidly. Shaur must be bridged i see below. Shaur-Shush (550'). —45 miles. Up to within 10 miles of Shush line follows west hank of Diz. Alluvial soil: no sand or stones ; plentiful brushwood. 10 miles south of Shush grand hills about 60 feet high and J mile in breadth are encountered : these offer no difficulty whatever and will be valuable source of gravel for ballast. The line would probably leave Shush 2 miles to the west. Shush- Dizful (68#').—-18 miles over flat and, near Dizful, stony ground. Excellent ballast available from pebbles and boulders in Diz and Bala Hud. Two branches of Bala Hud to be crossed. See below. Irrigated cultivation in many places. 18. Bridging. Khaz*aliyeh canal behind Mohanimerah.—Zi) feet bridge necessary &gt;. 12 feet above ground. Shaur River. —This is a mere ditch : as it takes its rise level from springs near Shush, it is subject only to local floods. A 50 feet span resting on masonry buttresses on either hank should be ample. Alluvial soil. North of the Shaur for 2 miles the ground is subject to flood from marshes by the Kharur nala : pitching of stone or brick will be required, and one or two culverts. Bala Bud. —Two branches to be crossed : river bottom and subsoil gravel: river changes its bed from time to time, unless trained: dry in summer : floods to 5 feet or 6 feet in spring, but not more. At certain points the bed of the stream is well defined: at such points the breadth of water at flood level is about 35 yards, normal spring level 20 yards. A bridge composed of three 60 feet spans, resting on masonry pillars would probably be economical. The above applies equally to both branches. 19 Local Labour .—The labour obtainable in Arabistan is of two kinds, Arab and Persian. The Arab, however, is too well off to be under the necessity of working with the spade for 2 Krans (9 pence) a day and is constitutionally unfitted for regular and strenuous work. The experience of the Anglo-Persian 011 Company is that it is mainly upon Persian labour that reliance must be placed, but they have had no difficulty in obtaining 1,000 Arabs for work near Mohammerah. In Ahwaz and elsewhere in Arabistan, Persian (Lur) labourers are plenti ful and fairly satisfactory. Usual pay 2 Krans a day (9 pence). Dizful labour is above the average, as it includes many skilled cultivators. Excavation is usually performed by basket and spade. The spade used locally is of a special long handed type, but the experience of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is that Lurs adapt themselves readily to the European pattern shovel and pick. The Erench Scientific Mission at Shush have had the same experience: they use light rails and trucks for removing spoil, with good results: the Lur takes to them readily: long handed spades are, however, much used. Lurs, and also Arabs, work best in gangs under their own Chiefs : unless some such arrangement is made they are apt to get out of hand, but they are onI the whole easily handled and amenable to mild discipline. Good bricklayers and masons are available in Dizful. 20. Gauge —The gauge of Russian railways in the Caucasus (5' 0') would probably be chosen by the Russian Government for the north section of the Julfa-Mohammerah railway, and would presumably be accepted by us, as we could oppose no valid argument to its adoption. A metre gauge railway would, however, probably suffice for all probable requirements of traffic for many years to come and would be on financial grounds in every way prefer able. 21. Gradients. —Practically flat the whole way : the hills at Nahr Hashim and south of Shush could be negotiated quite comfortably with 1,350 to 1,400. 22. Stations. — Mohammerah. The terminus at Mohammerah would of course be carefully designed to admit of subsequent enlargement. The site I suggest is on the Shatt-al-Arab above the Customs. It has a frontage directly opposite the accepted anchorage on the Shatt-al-Arab, from which it would be easy to throw out piers: the Customs House is close by. Sab'eh. —A second station or wayside halt at Sab’eh seems called for, primarily in order to give facilities for water which can be obtained here from the Karun. Nahr Hashim. —A station here would serve Hawizeh, and eventually should irrigation be undertaken, the Nahr flashim district. VFater obtainable from Karkheh. Bizful. —The station would be on west bank of Diz opposite town : the abandoned Government House on west bank of Diz (Kushk) might well be utilized in this connection. Provision for its occupation by the Railway as storehouse, quarters for staff, etc , might be made in the concession. Water from Diz. 24. Ftiel.—Tha Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s refinery at Braim, 5 miles from Mohammerah, is conveniently situated to supply oil fuel in any quantity, and it will be unnecessary to import coal. The engines on the Russian section of the line will be doubtless fitted to burn oil and it is fortunate that the south ern section should be not less favourably situated in this respect. In the Qilah district, 48 miles off Dizful, there are certain pitch springs, indicating, possibly, the existence of oil in paying quantities. Were a railway through Luristan to be opened it is possible that the Oil Company would bore for oil there, as also at Tang-i-Haleh near Madian Rud in Luristan. 24. Estimated cost of Mohammerah-Bizful section. —Sir William Will- cocks has estimated the approximate cost of construction and equipping a railway of 4 8^' gauge in Arabistan at about £3,000 a mile. This corresponds closely with Mr. W. A. John’s estimate (for Seistan railways) of Rs. 50,000 a mile for “ surface line,” 5' 6' gauge. Taking the latter figure, the cost of this section would, via Aminiyeh, be Rs. 87,00,000 (eighty seven lakhs), Sir Milliam Willcocks quoted his figure as an outside estimate The total cost, inclusive of special works, is estimated at £633,333 {vide paragraph 18). For metre gauge the cost should not exceed £500,000. 25. Local Traffic. Bizful-Mohanmerah. —Imports from Mohammerah and Amarah into Dizful are not large, probably not over 1,000 tons per annum. Exports are even smaller, owing to lack of communications, The existence of a railway would afford a stimulus to agriculture, and the exports of grain, reeds for pens, oil seeds, cotton, wool, gum, galls, etc., would rapidly increase and might reach a total of 10,000 tons by the end of the third year. It is not probable that the railway, even were it to touch the Kama opposite Ahwaz, would be able to secure an appreciable proportion of the imports and exports which are now transported by steamer between Ahwaz and Mohammerah, and forwarded from Nasiri to Ispahan by mules. It seems certain, therefore, that the river steamers will always be in a position on this river, so long as it is not utilized for irrigation, to compote successfully with the railway. fThe necessity of transporting goods brought up by railway across the Karan to Nasiri from Aminiyeh, the railway station on the opposite bank, a process involving double handling, would make shippers unwilling to use the line, particularly as the ocean going steamers can now unload straight into barges which are towed up to Nasiri without breaking bulk, and are passed through the Customs there instead of at Mohammerab. Other local traffic. —Hawizeh may be expected to give 200 to 300 tons imports and 1,000 to 1,500 exports; this figure would probably be doubled in three years after the railway was in working order. 26. Reason why Mohammerah and not Ahwaz should he terminus of the Railway. —A brief note on this point seems necessary owing to the persistent public advocacy of Ahwaz as the terminus of this line by Mr. H. B. Lynch, who, as Managing Director of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, presumably views with concern the possibility of competition by the railway between Ahwaz and Mohammerah with his steamers on the Karan. The Ahwaz-Mohammerah line will be cheaper: the river boat service is slow, and uncertain, owing to shoals, dust-storms, etc. Landing facilities for cargo at Aminiyeh would be difficult, owing to shoals in river, which frequently changes its main channel. The river boat service, unless a very large in crease of traffic took place, could not run more than two boats a week : and goods and passengers would run the risk of waiting 3 or 4 days at Mohammerah, if not more. The interposition of a river steamer service would involve two, if not more, additional handlings of the goods, involving expense and risk of breakage which is a heavy item in this country, 27. Reasons why Shushtar should not he touched by the Railway, —(1) It would add about 20 miles to the length of the railway. (2) It would involve the construction of three large bridges on the Karun and its tributaries, and several minor ones, thus adding greatly to the cost of the line: the alignment via, Shushtar would moreover, independently of the necessary bridges, be considerably more expensive per mile than that via Dizful. (3) It would involve negotiations with the Bakhtiari Khans in respect of the Shushtar*Dizful section, and with the Shushtaris in regard to the Band-i- Qir-Shushtar section : both are difficult to deal with, particularly the latter. (4) Shushtar is a decaying town, and would be so to a greater degree but for the fact that at present it serves as a dep6t for Dizful. Its needs are sufficiently supplied by the steamer service on the Upper Karun. The town is, however, mentioned in the Shah’s rescript referred to above, on the subject of railway concessions, and it appears in the British Note to Persia on the subject. 28. Time required for construction of Mohammerah-Dizful Railway .— Since construction could be started at half-a-dozen points without inconveni ence (communication by river extending to within town of Dizful, close to the line of railway) the rate of construction will depend chiefly upon the amount of labour employed. There would seem no reason why the line should not be completed within two years from date of commencement of actual operations. Labour is plentiful, work can go on all the year round, and as far as this section is concerned practically nothing is needed but the simplest earthwork, and not much of that. Any concession for such a railway from the Persian Government should include the right to run steam or motor boats and barges on the Diz and Upper Karun for the purpose of transporting material, etc. 29. Persian Gulf terminus. Reasons why Mohammerah and not Rhor Musa should he selected 1 . —The navigation of Khor Musa is not without 1 The terms of our application of March 31 st, 1911 , for a railway option were. “fora port at Khor Musa and for a railway northwards as far as Khurramabad with a branch to Mohammerah if found desirable.”P % *5- 20 danger owing to tiie Umrnul Sis wan and Ummul Dibab focks. It is d($titute of fresh water, which could only be brought with great difficulty from near Fallahiyeh or Buziyeh, 40 miles distant. The whole land for many miles round and inland is flooded twice daily at high tide, and farther north lie great marshes, impassable on foot for eight months in the year, extending half way to Ahwaz. No measures could ever make Khor Musa a habitable port, m my belief and were the railway to be brought down to the coast at this spot, the vast proportion of goods traffic would still find an outlet from Mohammerah, the Karun river steamers being used between Mohammerah and Ahwaz and vice versa. It goes without saying that no passengers would ever want to go to Khor Musa, and receipts under this head would be negligible. The climate of Mohammerah in summer leaves much to be desired, in spite of the amenities afforded by ice, fruit and fresh vegetables in plenty: but that of Khor Musa is trying to a degree which only those who have visited it (as I have) on several occasions during the summer months, can realize. The muddy shore into which the feet sink ankle deep at every step, is impreg nated with salt, and becomes so hot that no native can walk barefoot on it: and for a European thick boots alone can save him from acute discomfort. Stinging gnats and flies from the adjacent marshes swarm by night and would make sleep impossible were it not for the fatigue caused by the long sweltering day. Hot winds blow by night as well as by day. Every consideration, I submit, points to Mohammerah and not Khor Musa as the proper terminus, and I have worked on this assumption throughout. I quite realize, of course, that it is desirable for us to have a blocking option irrespective of Khor Musa for political and strategical reasons. 30. Position of Shaikh of Mohammerab in regard to Railway in Arab* tsfow.—The Shaikh of Mohammerah may be expected, in view of his close relations with the British Government, to co-operate with the latter m any scheme proposed by them for a railway through his territories. As the chief of a hegemony of all the Arab tribes in Arabistan, and responsible for their attitude to the Persian Government, it is upon him that we must rely to maintain order and prevent tribal animosities from impeding the progress of operations; the experience of ten years shows that he will not fail to do so. But his position as landowner must also be borne in mind. He holds farmans granting to him, among other districts, that of Mohammerah, which extends up to the west bank of the Karun to a point a few miles north of Sab eh), Erom this point to Shush, 15 miles south of Dizful, the proposed alignment passes through the following districts, all of which are claimed, under farmans of the Shah, by the present Nizam-es-Saltaneh, nephew of the late Husain Quli Khan, Nizam-es-Saltaneh, to whom they were originally granted. They are all leased to Shaikh Khaz’al. (1) Kamn west bank. (2) Kut Nahr Hashitn. (3) ’Anafijeh. (4) Hussain abad. It would probably be easy to obtain unirrigated land free of cost, ami thus reduce the cost of acquisition of land to a small figure, as the railway would pass through irrigated land only at the terminus, Mohammerah, and near Dizful. Were it decided to commence construction of this line the first step would be to conclude an agreement with the Shaikh by which he undertook respon- sibility for the safety of the line, and granted the necessary lands at a nxed price. The Nizam-es-Saltaneh might be left to put in his claim for compensa- tion in respect of the cultivated lands or the lands intermittently cultivatea which have been appropriated for the use of the railway and which he may claim as his own.21 The lands in the neighbourhood of Shush belonging to the Nizam, have been leased to a Russian subject for 25 years, but. he is not likely to be in a position to raise serious difficulties, and bis lands could be avoided if necessary by keeping west of the Shaur till Shush was passed, or by keeing east of the Diz, crossing it again near Dizful. 31. Possible tribal opposition outside ShaiTcKs territories. —I think it improbable that any serious opposition to the construction of the line, or of any serious attempt to interfere with it when constructed, would be experi enced. A hundred armed men supplied by the Shaikh would be ample to protect the camps from occasional raiding parties of trans-frontier Arabs, and if the Persian Government could be induced to consent to the employment of Pioneers from India, their double rdle of workmen and soldiers would stand them in good stead and probably greatly facilitate rapid construction. More over, their position and duties as Pioneers would conceal to a large extent their military r61e and enable their services to be utilized without causing great alarm to the Persian Government. The presence of Lur tribes, mainly Sagwand, in the neighbourhood of Shush and Dizful might cause some slight difficulty, hut these tribes take readily to manual labour and the advent of the railway, with the consequent demand for unskilled labour, would be welcome to them. In any case, the support of their Chiefs could be obtained without great expense. 32. Total cost of Arabistan section. —Adopting the Aminiyeh alignment for the purpose of my estimate, and assuming broad gauge to be desired, as else where, I deduce the following estimate of cost:— 174 miles “ surface line,” at Rs. 50,000 a mile • •• Rs. 87,00,000 Special works. (1) Mohammerah terminus, wharf, etc. t 6,50,000 (2) Aminiyeh ferry service, wharves, tramway rapids, etc. ... above • • • 1 ,00,000 (3) Repairs of Dizful bridge ... 50,000 Total • • • 95,00,000 £6,33,000 £3,640 a mile. At metre gauge the total cost should not be over £500,000. Special works (2) and (3) require some explanation. If Nasiri is to be served by the railway, some provision must be made for a ferry service and proper landing places on either side of the river. Provision must also be made for a light tramway, or slidings, connecting the Aminiyeh station with some convenient point above the rapids whereby goods can be transferred direct to steamers on the Upper Karun. The repairs of the Dizful bridge is a most necessary undertaking, in order to ensure traffic between the railway and the town being uninterrupted, and attended with less peril than is now the case, the centre span being unfenced and very rickety. %PART III. DlZrUL-KHTJRRAMABAD PORTION OP ALIGNMENT. 33. Alignment of the Railway through Luristan .—We must now consider the alignment of the railway through Luristan, it being assumed that Dizful is the point of departure in the south, and Purujird the objective in the north. The limits within which an alignment for a railway between these two places must be sought are, broadly speaking, the Dizful Kiyalan Dalich-Khurramabad- Zagheh-Burujird route to the east and the Qal’eh Saidmarreh-Gulgul-Dureh- Khurramabad-Bairarwand-Burujird route on the west. There is a general concensus of opinion, with which I am in full agree ment, that east of the Kiyalan route no practicable alignment even for a mule track can be found : the idea which has been prominently mooted in the public press, of selecting an alignment via the Ab-i-Diz valley must therefore he dismissed at once as impracticable. Sir Henry Rawlinson (1841) writes of it from personal experience as follows :— From the Tang-i-Bahrain (S. E. of Burujird) the Dizful river forces its way through a succpssion of chasms and gorges, and the track along its bank is utterly impracticable. Indeed, this part of the Zagros is so very precipitous that there is only one single pathway conducting across it from Dizful to Burujird: it is followed by nomads on foot, it is not to be traversed by a horseman, and is considered the most difficult of all mountain pathways. It breaks into the Shabra-i-Lur (N. of Dizful) between the hill forts of Tangawan and QaFeh-i- Shahi.” Major Bell (1884) and Major Sawyer (1889) (the latter surveyed much of the district) confirm these conclusions, as also does M. De Morgan (1891) from personal experience (p. 167, Vol. II). On the other hand the adoption of any alignment west of the Saidmarreh- Knh*i-Dasht line, would increase the length of the railway out of all proportion to any economy that might he secured thereby ; and in any case I am satisfied that the Saidmarreh^Kuh-i-Dasht or else the Kashgan gorge route is the easiest that can be found. Mention should perhaps he made of a possible route via the eastern branch of the Ab-i*Diz (through Baznawi) hut even were this branch not put out of court by reason of its greater length, Major Sawyer’s verdict is against it. The level river-bed road, which is said to have passed through this gap, and traces of which may be seen at Baznawi may be considered to have been an old world route before the more modern gap of Khurramabad was brought into use. The latter is perhaps better suited for the demands of the immediate future ; for though it has the comparative drawback of being on a higher level than the river course of the Ab-i-Burnjid, for instance, the latter might, owing to its numerous gorges and precipitous banks, require greater initial expenses to receive a civilized road or rail/’ This condemnation applies equally to both branches of the Diz above Dizful. Acting upon these premises I first of all examined the country east of the Kashgan with a view to finding a suitable alignment: dissatisfied with the result, which worked out, as will be seen later on, at over £12,000 a mile, for 184 miles, I proceeded to investigate the country west of the Kashgan river, and found a much better alignment estimated at 185 miles at about £9,100 a mile. 34. The first “ ruling point ” which any alignment must necessarily touch is the Ab-i Znl, where it traverses the plain of QaBeh-i-Riza. This can be reached from Dizful via Kal-i-Nai or QaBeh-i-Husainiyeh. The former route is shorter but more difficult : it traverses no great elevation, Kal-i-Nai (1,700') being the highest point touched, hut from Dukuh onwards for practically the whole of its length it crosses a succession of low ridges separated by ravines often from 50'to 100'deep, and a railway would involve alternate deep cut tings, lofty embankments and bridges, the lengths of “ surface ” line being not more than 2 miles between Dukuh and the Raza plain. 1 Reconnaissance in BakLtiari Country, S. W. Persia, 1891 , Part I, p. 13 .23 kr P I recommend tlie Qal’eh Husainiyeh alignment therefore and will proceed to describe its general features, 35. First Section. JDizful (700') DuTcuh (900') 12 miles. A gentle rise of 20 to 30 feet per mile throughout, increasing slightly near Dukuh. Eor the first 6 miles as far as Salihabad undulating, well cultivated ground, cultivated in places. Numerous small irrigation canals near Salihabad. The formation is conglomerate, with a thin covering of soil, or debris from the Bala Bud and Kuh*i-Tangawan. From Salihabad onwards the ground is stony and the line suggested crosses many small water-courses, dry except immediately after rain, bringing down quantities of debris from the hills. The best alignment, I should say, would pass the ancient tanks known as Do Hauzan. and would enter the low hills at Dukuh about 3 miles east of the Bala Bud Cod —This section may he classed, following Mr. John’s estimate, as “ easy line ” at Rs. 90,000 a mile for 6 miles “surface line 5 * at Bs. 50,000 for 6 miles. Total Bs. 810,000. Small culverts and revetments will frequently be necessary ; ballast everywhere available : embankments will be expensive, where necessary, as there is little soil, the ground being mainly boulders and gravel. Building stone not available: bricks will be cheaper and easily obtain able (of square tile shape) in Dizful. 36. Second Section. Dukuh. (900') to QaVeli-i-Riza (1,550') 23 miles. {.Approximate along proposed alignment). —Major Bell (1884i), apropos of cart- road construction, remarked of this section that “ the amount of road making to he done, zigzagging in and out of ravines, between a few miles south of Qal’eh Husainiyeh (1,150) and the Bidrubeh plain will exceed that in any equal distance between Dizful and Bhul•ramabad. ), Between these points the track winds its way amongst intricate hills, of no great elevation, composed of sand-stones topped with a hard conglomerate in places : it constantly crosses ravines from 50' to 100' in depth. Without a detailed survey of this 'section it is impossible to suggest any particular alignment. I satisfied myself, however, by a bird’s eye view from Bard-i-Balleh and other points, that it cannot be circumvented. Three ravines about 100' deep are crossed, and about 20 smaller ones averaging 50'. From Bidrubeh onwards to Qal’eli Biza (3 miles) the alignment should present no difficulties : by keeping north of the present track, not far from the foot of the limestone hills to the north, there should be no difficulty in obtaining a good though costly alignment of say 1 in 75 to 1 in 100. The Bala Bud must be bridged somewhere between Dukuh and Qal’eh Husainiyeh. The average breadth of the ravine in which it runs is about 300' at bottom and about 60' deep. The whole section will be a difficult and expensive one to survey and to construct. No great difficulty is to be anticipated in regard to the gradient, as the route rises steadily from Dukuh to Qal’eh Husainiyeh (1,150') with an average slope of 30' to 40' to the mile. No difficulty should be thus experienc ed in obtaining a gradient of 1 in 100, though heavy cutting and embanking, and bridges of some height must be looked for throughout. By increasing the ruling gradient to 1 in 50 some saving would no doubt accrue, but it would convert the railway into a switchback, so narrow in section are the ridges to be traversed. I do not think tunnelling could be usefully resorted to at any point. Between Qal’eh Husainiyeh (1,150') and Qal’eh Biza (1,550') 14 miles, the highest point that the railway would have to traverse is about 1,700', 4 miles from Qal’eh Biza.

(1,950') 14 miles,—l select Ahmed Kuchikek as the end of this section because it is a ruling point through which any alignment must pass, being the lowest point of a saddle formed by an extension of the slopes of the Kabir Kuh across the valley : the Saidmarreh river forces its way through the obstacle thus placed in its way by a deep gorge : the edge of the ravine being some 200' higher than the proposed alignment. Between Qal’eh Riza and Pul-i-Tang (9 miles! two alternative alignments present themselves : the hrst keeps to the northern side of the Qal’eh Riza plain, crosses the Zal just below the point where it entei s the plain, near an ancient (probably Sassanian) high-level bridge or aqueduct and keeps to the foot of the gypsum hills, crossing the Ab-i*Tirada, and lour large ravines, till it debouches on to the gentle lime-stone slopes near Pul-i-Tang. The advantages of this alignment are (1) it does not descend below 1,350'; (2) it is probably one mile shorter than the alternative route ; (3) it does not cross the Saidmarreh; (4) a gradient of 1 in 100 could in all probability be obtained, though at great cost: its disadvantages are (1) not less than six bridges of some size; (2) heavy cutting for about 2 miles, alternatively with heavy embankments ; (3) awkward curves round gypsum spurs ; (4) hills travers ed between Tirada and Pul-hTang are gypsum which is rapidly corroded by water and which blasts badly, being of very unequal consistency. The alternative alignment keeps to the south side of the Qal’eh Riza plain : crosses the Saidmarreh at 1,300' just below its junction with the Zal and Tirada streams : continues over the flat stony plain of Siyah Gilal, and re-crosses the Saidmarreh at 9 miles near Pul-i*lang (1,300 ). This aligment has the follow ing disadvantages ; (1) it reaches a level 50 lower than the first mentioned line; (2) it involves two bridges across the Saidmarreh ; (3) it involves^ a gradient of between 1 in 50 and 1 in 75 between Pul-i-Tang (1,300 ) and Ziarat Ahmed Kuchikeh (1,950'), a rise of 450' having to be distributed over about 5 miles. A 50' cutting through the gypsum at Ziarat Ahmed Kuchikeh will assist matters, and a slight increase in length can be arranged for so as to diminish the slope, but the best that can be expected is 1 in 7 5. There will be no difficulty in keeping an even gradient from Pul-i-Tang to Ahmed Kuchikeh, as for the whole distance the line will cross gentle lime-stone slopes. Its advantages are (1) cheapness : I think it will be found that the cost of the two bridges is amply compensated for by the lack of heavy works elsewhere : (2) rapidity of construc tion : the heavy cuttings through the gypsum hills will take a long time as also will the bridging of the ravine. It will necessitate the following bridges :— (1) Across Saidmarreh below the Zal junction : steep but not precipi tous. The river is here 150' to 200' broad: banks 60 to 80 high: bed rocky : depth unknown, probably not over 10' in summer: width from bank to bank about 450\ (2) Across Saidmarreh near Pul-i-Tang. The river here flows through a deep gorge 6' to 10' broad at bottom, 12' to 20' at top, but no more than S' broad in places : it is bridged by a single span stone bridge: a bridge some 250 yards long would be necessary but no spans need be longer than 20'.

Fourth Section. Ahmad Kuchikeh (IjOoO') to Ab-i-Fani (1,500') — 15 miles. —Ab-i-Eaui may be taken as the next ruling point beyond Ahmad Kuchikeh : its height, where it joins the Saidmarreh, is 1,500'; where it issues from the gorge though Kiyalan Kuh, 1,700'. The distance for railway purposes may be taken as 15 miles. Prom Ahmad Kuchikeh there is a steady descent down the Jauzar valley till at about 5 miles the Saidmarreh is reached at the point where it enters the long gorge, the south end of which is Pul-i-Tang, height here, 1,400': there is, therefore, a fall of 450' in 5 miles to be negotiated. If the line be taken along the limestone slopes between the Jauzar stream and the Saidmarreh gorge there will he no difficulty in giving an even gradient, and curvature will be easy, but it will be difficult to get a gradient much better than 1 in 60. 1 in 100 could he attained but at considerable expense, by following the outlines of the foot hills of Kiyalan Kuh, only touching the 1,400' level near the Lailum stream, hut the curves will he 3 awkward, the length of line probably one mile at least greater, and the work difficult and expensive. As 1 in 50 will he unavoidable in subsequent sections, I propose the former alignment: it passes over gentle limestone slopes with no difficult features such as spurs or ravines. The next five miles to the Ab-i-Lailum lie along the Saidmarreh valley, near the river. The Lailum stream can he crossed ^ mile above its junction with the river : height of stream here 1,500', banks 50' higher: width from bank to bank 300': fordable : rocky bottom : width of stream average 200': water slightly bitter, not over 1'6' deep in summer. Prom Lailum to the Fani stream, 5 miles, the best alignment seems to be close to the river : easy throughout except at 15 miles where there is an awk ward spur abutting on the Saidmarreh : it would involve heavy cutting. As regards cost, I think this section may fairly be classed as follows:— Rs, Rs. Easy ... ... 5 m. @ 1,25,000 ... ... 6,25,000 Medium hilly in rock 8 m. @ 1,50,000 ... ... 12 , 00,000 Heavy ghat line 2 m. @ 1,75,000 ... 3,50,000 21,75,000 39. We have now reached the point where the alignments respectively east and west of the Kashgan river commence to diverge. I went over the eastern alignment via Dalich and Lada bad with care, surveying it throughout: as, however, I rejected it in favour of a line along or west of the Kashgan, it seems unnecessary to trouble Government with aj % 26 detailed description of it. 1 I will therefore confine myself to an abstract of the length and cost of this line, as estimated by me :— Total, sections one to four 64 miles ... « Rs. ... 88,65,000 Section 5, Ab-i-Fani-Chul 21 „ 34,75,000 „ 6 , Chul—foot of Dalich 26 „ 55,00,000 „ 7, Ab-i-Sard-Chimashk 17 „ ... 29,50,000 „ 8 , Chimashk 15 „ ... 22,75,000 „ 9, Dadabad-Khurramabad 40 „ ... ... 73,00,000 184 miles 3,34,65,000 = £2,231,000 average over £ 12,000 a mile. Railway gradient 1 in 50. Curvature difficult: 200 yards radius the best that can be hoped for in many places. 40. The Madian Rud alignment west of the Kashgan —I will now proceed to describe the alternative alignment west of the liashgan river, to which I turned my attention as soon as I had reached Khurramabad by the route described above. It diverges from the alignment first described at the point being miles 64 costing end of the fourth section, the totals up to this Rs. 88,65,000. Before describing this section I may remark that a gorge line up the Kashgan to Dureh is probably practicable but I have not been able to go fully into the question as the Kashgan was not fordable and the track which runs up the Kashgan valley crosses the river constantly. An alignment up the gorge as far as I can make out, after examining it foy 6 miles above Pul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar and at Tang-i-Tir and near PuH-Kalhur would be a very expensive gorge line, with 15 or 20 bridges of 100' or so each over the Kashgan. We may estimate the cost at 3 lakhs a mile for 60 miles=s 180 lakhs : this compares rather unfavourably with the Gulgul Madian Rud alignment described below, but the possibility is well worth careful examina tion when the time comes. This alignment is dealt with in paragraph 46. 41. Fifth Section, Ab-i-Fani (1,400') to mouth of Tang-uKhirsdarr. (2,100') 20 miles (approximately by alignment along Saidmarreh and Kashgan rivers) to Jaidar. This will be a difficult and expensive section : gradient on the average easy, not more than 1/75. The line would follow the general line of the Saidmarreh river to where it is joined by the Kashgan, below Pul Gamishan : thence up the Kashgan valley to the mouth of the Tang-i-Khirsdarr, within which lies the ruins of a splendid Sassanian bridge, known as the Pul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar or Pul Shapur. I think I shall be within the mark if I class it as heavy ghat ” at Rs. If lakhs a mile for 20 miles. Total for 5th section Rs. 85,00,000—miles 20. Grand Total Rs. 123,65,000—miles 84. 42. Sixth Section. Mouth of Tang-uEhirsdarr (2,100') to top of Tang-i- Millehdar on Rumishgan plain (4,100') 19 miles. —This will be the most difficult piece on this alignment, for it is here that we ascend on to the Luristan plateau, a rise of 2,000' in 19 miles. The Tang-i-Khirsdarr is accessible from the south, it may be noted, only on foot, unless the Kashgan is fordable. There is a possibility that the alignment for a metre gauge railway would be easier up the Tang-i-Khirsdarr and the Pam Pariz valley than via Millehdar as now described. The detailed notes of this alignment are on record in the Bushire Residency.27 I have submitted a separate report regarding the suitability of the former alignment for a cart road. The alignment I suggest runs along the slopes ofjKuh Maleh, rising steadily on a gradient of about 1 in 50. This hill is a saddle hack : slope of rock on southern side 15° to 20° : formation very hard limestone : face of hill but little furrowed by water courses, and contour lines very straight. The track will have to he made by blasting and revetting the whole way. I shall, I hope, be on the safe side in allowing two lakhs a mile for this section. Rs. Miles.

Top of Tang Millehdar to Kuh-i-Dasht 'plain .— This section traverses 4 low ranges of hills : the first range Daghilleh-Sidann is pierced by the Tang Jangir, through which the alignment proposed passes: the second range Madian Kuh is skirted to the east and crossed at its lowest point about 4,500'. The third range, K. Astan-Kalkhani, is similarly circumvented at about 5,000'. The fourth range is pierced by the Tang Haleb and by the Madian Rud (4,150' at the bridge) : but it will probably be cheaper to take the line via Gulgul and pierce the fourth range by a tunnel of J mile at the north end of the Kuh-i-Dasht Plain near Chashmeh Kamir: the height of the range here is 4,700': that of the spring about 4,500'. There is no use in my suggesting any particular alignment: several alter natives readily suggest themselves to any one on the spot. I estimate the dis tance that would have to be covered by the line in order to reach the south edge of the Kuh-i-Dasht plain at 20 miles, of which 10 miles easy at Rs 75,000 a mile and 10 miles at IJ lakhs, as a good deal of blasting will be required— 10 miles ... ... 7,50,000 10 „ ... ... 15,00,000 Total for 7th Section ... 22,50,000— miles 20 Grand Total 183,15,000 „ 123. 44. Eighth Section. Kuh-i-Dasht plain (4,500') to Kashgan (3,650') 35 miles:—In this section we have to traverse or circumvent the Kuh-i-Guraz range, 6 000 1 hi^h. It has a breadth of over 4 miles, and tunnelling is scarcely prac ticable : it can however be circumvented to a large extent by skirting it east ward towards the Kashgan. This involves a rise to about 5,800' and thence a steadv fall can be provided to the Kashgan, which would be crossed probably not far from the bridge at 3,600'. The anarchical conditions prevailing pre vented me from examining the whole of the alignment but I am satisfied that it is practicable. Distance: —difficult to estimate, as owing to haze I was unable to triangu late satisfactorily. Across Kuh-i-Dasht plain 8 miles : rising from 4,300' to ^700' skirting south slopes Kuh-i-Guraz to east to near Kashgan 12 miles : from 4,700 to 5,000 and thence, downwards, round east end of Kuh-i-Guraz to near Tang-i-lir, 8 miles, and another 7 miles to some point near Pul-i-Kashgan : total 35 miles.

It should he possible to adopt a gradient not steeper than 1 in 75. 45. Ninth Section. Kashgan (3,650') to Rhurramabad 57 miles :— The alignment would follow the Kashgan It. to its junction with the Ab-i- Khurramabad and then follow the general trend of the latter stream to the town. Various alternatives will doubtless suggest themselves when a proper survey is made, but the general alignment will remain the same. This section will present no difficulty : the last 10 miles would be “ surface ” line, were it not for the numerous small bridges and culverts that will have to be construct ed and the slight embankment will be necessary to keep the slope even from terrace to terrace. The first 17 miles will be difficult to align, but should not be very expensive to construct, the hills being mainly of alluvium or shale with a little limestone.

The Kashgan Gorge alignment (vide paragraph 40). I will now return to another alignment, up the gorge of the Kashgan river from its entrance to the Jaidar plain at Pul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar to its exit from the Khurramabad plain at Tang-i-Tir about 40 miles north. I had contemplated traversing this gorge or valley from end to end: un fortunately, however, owing to the unprecedented snow of this year, and a late season, the river was in full flood and quite unfordable. As the track up the valley crosses the river 30 or 40 times it was impossible for me to get up the gorge and I had to content myself by seeing what I could of it at intervals. The river winds amongst steep hills, generally ending in cliffs abutting on the bed: a big bend occurs about every two miles, when the river will be running on one bank or the other up against a cliff : it is then necessary to cross to the other bank which is usually a flat terrace : there is no clear view of the valley for more than three or four miles and at several points the cliffs on both sides run down to the water, leaving only a difficult mule track which is covered when the river is in flood. At such points heavy rock cutting, revet ting, and tunneling will be necessary. The river must be constantly crossed, involving numerous bridges. The average breadth of the river when it is not spread over the gravels, or divided into several branches, is about 200': 300' would have to be provided as a rule, from abutment to abutment to provide for flood water. The river is liable to heavy floods, a rise of 15' being not unknown : the bed uniformly gravelly : no reefs or falls as far as I know. The valley is narrow, but there is always a fairly wide stretch of river terraces on one bank or the other. Difficult as the construction of a railway up such a valley would be, the alignment is a not unattractive one. It would be possible to have an almost even slope from Saidmarreh to Khurramabad : and the ruling gradient would probably not exceed 1/100 at any point. Steel trestle bridges of stock size might be used to cross the stream and would, if I may presume to offer an opinion on such a technical point, be well suited to the country and conditions of labour and construction. 47. To estimate the cost of the gorge line, the length of which from Tang-i-Tir to Pul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar may be taken at 40 miles, is of course quite beyond me, even had I been able to traverse it from end to end. I am assured, however, on the authority of the Sardar Akram and others, the general accuracy # &lt; i jof whose statements I have been able to check, that a mule track exists right up the gorge and that at no point does it contract to such an extent as to form an impassable canyon. Allowing 3 lakhs a mile for the line, including bridges, and 25 lakhs for special tunnelling (which would seem, all things considered, to be a liberal allowance) for the northern and southern ends of this valley, which I have traversed, and the centre, which I have seen from a short distance, offer no formidable obstacles to railway construction, we obtain a total of 180 lakhs. The total cost of this alignment would thus be as follows:— Es. Es. Sections 1 to 5 miles 84 at 65,000 ... &lt;». 123,65,000 Kashgan gorge » 40 ••• ••• 145,00,000 Tang-i-Tir-Khnrramabad„ 16 ... ... 12,00,000 Grand total ... 120 ... ... 280,6o,000 £1,871,000 or £15,600 a mile. 48. The difference between the cost of this alignment and that via Madian Bud is £171,000 according to this estimate, which is a mere guess: the saving of length is no less than 65 miles, about one quarter of the distance between Dizful and Burujird : the absence of steep gradients is an added advantage. Had I seen any chance of being able to examine this valley more closely, I would have waited for another month or two in order to do so, but the Sardar Akram, who alone could arrange for my safe conduct along this line, left for the Kermanshah district to revenge the murder of a friend of his, by plundering the guilty tribe and simultaneously hostilities commenced between the Bairar- wand and the Governor-General, making any further stay in the neighbourhood out of the question. I think it not improbable that this alignment may turn out very little more, perhaps less, expensive than that via Kuh-i-Dasht and I would recom mend that any engineer expert who may subsequently be deputed to prepare authoritative estimates and effect a regular and detailed survey of an alignment should first examine the Kashgan gorge: in order to do so, he must make his survey between June and November (the floods this year being quite abnormal) and must arrange with the Sardar Akram (whose headquarters are a ar an) to provide the necessary escort which he will, no doubt, gladly do. the saving in length by this route may he considered to justi y expenditure. In any case some extra30 PART IV. Possible eytensions oe alignment erom Khurramabae northwards. 49. Possible prolongation of line from Khurramabad onwards. —The easiest prolongation would undoubtedly be towards Kermanshah, distant rather more than 100 miles : the country traversed is well fitted for a railway align ment which would run parallel to the mountain ranges which run in a north- north-western direction throughout Luristan. But such prolongation would be of little use towards developing British trade in Central Persia, and I assume that the prolongation contemplated is to Burujird and thence to Tehran via Hamadan or via Sultanabad and Kum. The boundary between the Russian sphere of influence and the neutral zone in this region is “ a line starting from Kasr-i-Shirin, passing through Ispahan ” Kermanshah and Burujird are thus included in the region in which Great Britain engaged not to seek concessions “ for railways, laud, telegraphs, road, transport, insurance, etc”., though all concessions which existed in the region in question on August 31st 1907 are maintained. The boundary line is roughly equidistant between Khurramabad and Buru- iird. A prolongation by rail or motor beyond Khurramabad would presumably be possible onlyVith the consent of the Russian Government who, it has been suggested, are likely eventually to view the project with hostility. Without such a prolongation, at all events as far as Burujird, the utility of the line would be greatly impaired and the volume of exports in particular would be of quite insignificant proportions. Khurramabad is a very bad distributing centre: the local market is negligible: the surrounding country disturbed: traffic on the main road to Burujird greatly impeded by snow in winter, and I feel convinced that any attempt to make the town into a railway terminus will be predoonoed to failure, and trade will stick to the route via Baghdad, in which town are many whole sale dealers, from whom small buyers can order direct. The only practical alignment between Khurramabad and Burujird is that via Zagheh, which I will now proceed to describe in detail. 50. Section 1.—Khurramabad to foot of Zagheh Pass (6,300') 21 miles .— A steady climb along a stream which runs from the foot of the Zagheh pass all the way to Khurramabad. A gradient of 1/50 is the best that can be obtained and it is possible that at one or two points 1/40 may be necessary for short distances. There is little heavy blasting but for the first ten miles there will be about three miles of blasting on the side of the hills, which are composed of limestone strata, covered in places by alluvial gravels and clay. The passage of the Tang-i-Zaideh Shir will involve some heavy cutting or embanking in order to reduce the gradient: so also will the ascent from the Tajareh to the Deh Safid plain. The Darreh Daraz valley once entered, the gradient becomes easier, and the line will be cheaper to construct: it would no doubt skirt the north side of the valley, rising steadily as far as is compatible with the main tenance of the ruling gradient. I estimate the cost at IJ lakhs a mile= 31^ lakhs. 51. Zagheh tunnel— Zagheh pass (7,200') now confronts us : apart from the practical difficulty of carrying a railway up its steep rocky slopes and over its narrow crest, such a course would involve a long detour. There is no way of circumventing the range and I think there is no doubt but that it must be tunnelled: from 5,600' on the south west to 6,500 on the north side is as nearly as i can judge 1| miles through limestone rock : water is plentiful. I have no means of estimating the cost with any approach to accuracy, but for the purposes of this report it may be put down at 60 lakhs. 52. Section II. Across the Ru-Rud valley from near Zagheh (6,500 ) to above Rang-i*Razan, (6,&amp;Q0'} — 15 miles.—Pxom. Zagheh the alignment winds down the valley of the Zagheh stream till it can turn north-east and skirt the South side of the Rud valley, crossing the stream at about 6,000'. It would then turn north-west and approach Rang-i-Razan village, 6,580 : then circle round the village and skirt the slopes of Kuh Ckavireh Shah in a west- uSI south-west direction, rising steadily to about 6,800' when the hill narrows sufficiently to make a tunnel in all probability, economical. There is no break in the Chayireh Shah range which the Zagheh-Razan road crosses at 7,200' and the descent on the North side to the Silakhor plain will be much more difficult from 7,200' than from 6,700', the height at which I propose the north exit of the tunnel should he fixed. I estimate this section to be 15 miles long costing lakhs a mile =18} lakhs. 5S. Razan Tunnel—1 estimate this to be 2,000 yards long : formation limestone rock: water plentiful. It might enter the hill on the south side at 6,800' and emerge at 6,700' into the Razan valley. Cost may he put down at 30 lakhs. I see no way of dispensing with it: the pass cannot be avoided, and if the railway he carried over it to 7,200' the drop of 1,500' to the Silakhor valley will be prohibitively steep. 54. Section III. Razan 6,700' head of tunnel to Silakhor plain (5,700 ')— 10 miles .—If the mouth on the Razan side be fixed at 6,700', the drop will be 1,000': the actual distance between the mouth of the tunnel and the foot of the hills being less than 5 miles. The sides of the Razan valley are, on the whole, of a conformation favour able to the construction of a railway along them, but whether the east or west of the valley should he selected is a point which can be settled after a careful survey. ]VIy impression is that it will be best to take the line into the Azizabad valley and thence skirt the hills bounding the Silakhor plain to the west, descending steadily on a gradient of 1 in 50 till the plain is reached at approxi mately 5,700'. This section will call for most careful surveys and a high degree of engineering skill. Blasting will be necessary almost all the way: and nu merous bridges across ravines will be called for in addition ^ to many culverts. I think three lakhs a mile would be fair estimate of cost, giving a total tor this section of bO lakhs. 55 Section IV. Tip Silakhor valley from near Chulan Chalan to Burn- jird (5,700') to (5,900*)—20 miles.—It will probably be found convenient to follow the main road crossing the river near Chulan Chalan and keep to the eastern side of the valley. The river bed is about 100 yards wide: breadth of stream nominally 40 yards: depth in summer and autumn, 3* to j teet: unfordable in spring: pebbly bottom. Plain is fairly level and not irrigated from river, but by canals or kanats from hill side: many villages scattered over the plain, nearly all fin 1911) deserted owing to the depredations of Lur tribesmen. There would be a certain amount of embanking and a little cutting neces sary if the line keeps to the eastern side of the valley and it would be well to allow f lakh a mile for this section, in addition to which we must allow a lakh for the bridge. Total 16 lakhs. 56. Abstract. Khurramabad to Burujird.— Section I Zagheh tunnel Section II ... Kazan tunnel Section 111... Section IV ... ... 21 miles Its. 31,50,000 ...

I was prevented both by my instructions and by the fact that hostili ties between the Governor-General and the Bairarwand Awand tribe were in active progress, from making a survey of the country traversed by this section; but this does not, I think, affect my conclusions^ in any way, as we are fortunately in possession of a careful survey of this parti cular portion of Luristan, made in 1889 by Yusaf Sharif under the superintend ence of Major Sawyer. My observations have tended to substantiate its accuracy and general reliability. 58. Burujird occupies strategically and commercially a very important position at the head of a wide fertile valley, on the edge of the central Persian plateau. Prom its gates good roads, easily adaptable to wheels or rails, diverge in every direction tapping the fertile districts of Silakhor Bala, Nihawand, Malayir, Kazzaz and ’Iraq. Prom Burujird— Miles approximately. Kangavar 70 Kermanshah 126 Hamadan 70 Tehran 270 Ispahan 210 Kum 160 Kasvin 150 Enzeli 288 59. A Burujird-Kangavar railway could be constructed at an average cost of about £5,000 a mile for 80 miles, say £800,000: it would connect with the Baghdad-Kermanshah-Hamadan-Tehran line. The ruling gradient womd be about 1 in 150. It would pass for the whole of its length through thickly populated, highly cultivated 1 country and would be a most efficient feeder line. A cart road with a ruling gradient of 1 in 25 could be built along the same alignment for about £3,000, the principal expense being caravansarais (6) bridges and culverts. 60. Potentialities of the Burujird district. Minerals .—I obtained information regarding several mines reported to exist near Burujird. Gold was said to be found in one mine, and I was given a sample 2 of the same, which I believe, however, to be simply micaceous sand. Lead ore was said to be found in remunerative quantities, 5 farsakhs distant; the ore yields 25 per cent of metal: the sample 2 I was shown seemed of very good quality. I was told at Nihawand that a European mining expert had said that the hills of this town contained good grade copper ore, but I had no opportunity of confirming this. I was told of a place west of Burujird, called Pial, where good quality coal-beds were exposed: the sample shown me was bituminous : it burnt well, but has, I should say, no commercial value. I was told that petroleum oil was found in the locality and had been col lected and burnt in lamps. Geologically, the distinguishing feature of the country immediately north and north-west of Burujird is that the limestone formation gives place to much contorted, finely laminated shales, extensively mixed with veins of intru sive rocks : the formation would thus seem to be very favourable to the existence of metalliferous ores. At Khurramabad I was shown specimen of bituminous coal from the Papi country east of that town, of iron pyrites from the same locality and of copper only on the surface and only the last named (which is used for dyeing) is worked at all.

I have in the previous pages suggested the possibility of a cart-road between Dizful and Burujird being preferable to a railway. _ For such a cart- road the Persian Transport Company holds a concession, which will expu Mav 1913 unless the road is opened before that date, The one formula _ obstacle which prevents it being built at once is the prevailing anarchy in Luristan : the Amir Mufakham has, however, made a determined effoit to open the road, I have little doubt that the fact of the road being in existence and the pressure that we could exert on the Persian Government to keep it o^n. Would ensure eventual success. I have submitted a separate report on this subject, and will confine myself here to stating briefly the alignment winch I propose. 62. From Dizful to Jaidar the road Would follow the general alignment proposed for the railway, caravanserais being erected at the marginally noted spots. Erom the Jaidar plain through the Tang-i-Khirsdarr across the Kashgan to Pul, Madian End, this is the main ascent of the route and the most expensive section, as the Kashgan must be bridged and an entrance to the gorge blasted. I went over this route and found it we suited for a cart track, the gradients being generally moderate (1 m 2o) and the expense of grading the steep portions small. Prom Madian^ End to Kmur- ramabad via Chinar Bardaghol Dureh and Naikash: this section was consi dered by Maior Burton to be fit in its present condition for wheeled artillery and it could certainly be converted into a cart-road at inodferate expense. Caravanserais necessary at Ali Gijan, Madian End Chinar, Barclaglml, Bureh and Changai, would again have to be rebridged near Dureh and the Knurrama- had river below the town. Prom Khurramabad to Burujird ma Zagheh and Eazan is always practicable for wheels, and little expense would be incurred except on the section between Eazan and the Silakhoi valley. 68. This route is about 220 miles long, and I have divided it into 18 stages : it is said to have been used in past times by Persian artillery : it was bv DeBode 1835 and Schindler 1889 and was undoubtedly a mam artery or trade in Sassanian times,—witness the great bridge of Pul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar in the Tang-i-Khirsdarr. I am satisfied it is the shortest practicable cart road. The experience of the Eoad Company in South Persia is, I believe, that it does not pay to carry merchandise in carts as a rule, pack animals being cheaper, it is pos si Die therefore that a 183 miles pack mule road from Dizful to Burujird in the Kiyalan would be of greater assistance to our trade than a 217 mile cart tracx which involves greater expense and a larger stall along the road : but it may be held also that under the concession the construction of a cart road is obliga tory, the phrase te route chanssee ” being used in the title, though nowhere else according to the English translation in my possession. It should also be borne in mind that where ordinary carts might not pay, motor traffic would perhaps do so: the employment of a Renard .train has recently been advocated on the Bandar Ahbas-Kerman road for instance. Purther, that the Transport Company has hitherto found itself quite unable to arrange for a sufficient supply of mules on the road in which they are interested : a mule-road unless well organised, would not serve the purpose o distributing British goods into the present Eussian zone, which is served by a well organised cart-road from Eesht to Hamadan.A) \% British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 25th July 1911. 0 No *1899.

From5 No. 11 of 1911. iiushire, 25th July 1911. From Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, I.A., On Special Duty. To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Sir, I havo the honour to submit herewith my report on the proposed Mohammerah-hhurramabad Railway, which I take the li berty to summarize briefly below. 2 . X estimate the cost of the whole line to be about £2,335,000 from Li diamine rah to uhurramabad, equivalent to about £6,‘180 a mile for 360 mixes, on a ruling gradient of 1 in 50. The abovo figures are for Russian gauge (o’O 51 ), at metre gauge the approximate cost would, I bwlieve, be £1,650,000. 3. I believe the project uo have a fair prospect of com mercial success were metre gauge to be adopted, though there seems even then to be no livelihood of it being worth while for any British Company to build it without a guarantee from trie British or Persian Government. 4. On the general question of its effect on British stra tegical,political and commercial interests, 1 express, with the greatest deference, my belief that our strategical position vis a vis Russia will not be substantially altered by the rail way, if built, but I regard its probable effect on our poli tical interests in the Gulf and in South West Persia generally with some apprehension. The tendency of the railway will be to weaVen the autonomous position of the Shaikh of Rohammerah, thus paving the way for a recrudescence in Arabistan of the anarchy which reigns supreme everywhere else in Persia, and which so handicapped our commerce in the years 1889-1895 bet ween the opening of the ixarun and the accession oi the present Shaikh7 5# Its inception will make the construction or railways in the north by Russia, and the continuation of the Khaniqin line to karmanshah inevitable, if indeed this is not already the case, though of course the converse of the proposition equally holds good. Since the Persian Government, as far as we can see, are not likely to be able to govern Luristan more effectively du ring the next decade than they have done in the past two cen turies, we must face the contingency of being called upon to take our own measures for the protection of the line at some future time: the Lur tribes are not at all formidable enemies, in my opinion, but the possibility of being called upon to guard such a long line of railway will be a considerable addi tion to our commitments in this part of Persia, without, it seems to be, any commensurate gain to our commerce. An inter national expedition with the same object would be even more objectionable• The prospect of the line being placed under international control is not one that we can view with complacency; it could scarcely fail to prejudice gravely our position in Arabiotan, and would lead to complications with the Shaikh. 6 , As regards the effect of the line on our commerce in Persia, I have expressed the belief that our predominance in the markets of which Ramadan is the centre will not be seriously- threatened until Aarmanshah is linked up with Baghdad, and that the projected Luristan line would not appreciably alter the proportion of British imports now consumed, though it should lead to a substantial increase in the quantity of goods passing \ through the hands of British firms and imported and exported | in British ships. Its main effect 'would be to displace the Russian sugar and hardware now entering from the North by the produce of Germany, France and Austria (though imported, we may hope, by British firms) and Russian oil by the products Ifct of the ivnglo-^ersian Oil Company, but demand in estern Persia A for the last named commodity is not likely to assume importance for many years to come.1 7. Ihe eiiect oi the proposed railway on the Baghdad-I s er- eian Lrulf line would be, I believe, to deprive the latter of a considerable proportion of its upward traffic, and impair its prospects of being financially profitable until irrigation on a large scale is introduced into Mesopotamia, but this re sult will not be attained unless the line is prolonged at once to burujird at least. I cannot believe, however, that it will for long post pone the construction of the Baghdad Persian u U lf line, nor permanently damage its position, i am much impressed jith the inadequacy of the Tigris and the importance to us of a Bagh- dad-Basrah railway which will place the capital of Mesopotamia in close touch with British shipping and go far to help us to retain our position in Baghdad, if honestly worked. If Baghdad is linked up with Europe but not with the uulf (and the Tigris is no substitute for a railway for this purpose) a hundred fac tors will tend to alienate Mesopotamia from the principal seats of our commercial and political influence in the middle East, and a diminution of our political prestige will follow, a se rious matter when it is remembered that Baghdad is the centre of the pilgrim traffic of largo section:; of the -ohamme^K^ world. The Bombay mills, moreover, are indisputably destined to find in liesopotaraia a large and increasing market for their products. 8 . I submit that we should use the ^©hammerah-ivhurramabad option only as a lever to obtain fair terms for ourselves on the Baghdad-Persian Gulf railway^ and that we should not take active steps to build it unless forced to do so by, for ins tance, the prospect of the right to do so being granted to others, or by failure on our part to obtain a predominant share in the Baghdad-Gulf section. In* the litter contingency, I have advocated the construction of a ..oharrunerah-Bizful line, con nected with idiurramabad and Burujird by good cart roads, for which we already have a concession, in this way securing to ourselvesourselves most of the benefits of the railway without the po litical risks which, it is suggested, its construction would 9.

Whilst fully realising that any decision on the part of His Majesty’s Govern ent in regard to the co- otruction of railways in South Wes#*Fersia must ultimately depend upon considerations of which I am, for the most part, Ignorant, and regarding which I am not competent to express an opinion, it seems nevertheless ^ convenient that I should preface this roport on the practical ' aspects of the projected Luristan line by a brief summary of some of the principal general and political considerations af fecting it, as far ,as I am aware of them. 2. The attitude of the Russian Government. The attitude of the Russian Government to the Luristan pro ject has undergone a notable change since 1907, and it had de clared its strong dislike on commercial grounds of any railway which approaches the Russian zone from the Gouth; whilst re cognizing our right to construct the Luristan line as far as ^hurramabad, Russian Foreign Ministers have been unanimous in their belief that the Russian public opinion would be strongly opposed to any action by Great Britain in such a direction. No great outcry, however, seems to have been made by the Russian press,I press, which has shown less interest in the matter than that of Germany, and Russia has been unable to offer any valid reason ior opposing us in this direction, whilst assisting Germany to join up Baghdad with Teheran, Hostile as Russia undoubtedly is to the project, it seems improbable that she will be able to press her objections so strongly as to affect materially whatever decision may be ar rived at by His Majesty’s Government. Her need of British cap ital for railways in the Horth alone suffices to make her prac tically unable to offer determined diplomatic opposition to our proposals• She may, however, effectively oppose our entry into the Russian sphere by an extension of our line to Burujird, and may place obstacles in the way of any connection being made bet ween our terminus there and Russian lines which may in the mean time have been brought down from the Horth: she might also ham per us by stipulating for international control, and by op- posing the running of motor traffic on our roads, should we desire to initiate ouch between idiurramabad. and Burujird, for instance, or from Burujird northwards. 3. Relation of the project to and its effect on, the Baghdad Railway . As long^as 1891 M.Qe Liorgan, ^hiof of the 'Dele gat ion Scien- tifique en Perse' in his published reports discussed briefly the Luristan railway project, and came to the conclusion that, as a commercial speculation, it could not bear comparison with the Baghdad-j^armanshah line, which had few physical difficulties to contend with. Prom the purely commercial point of view this seems not improbable particularly when it is remembered that a Baghdad- ivarmanshah line might form part of a great through route to India from Europe via Constantinople, uut it will connect &amp; 98 t eV Persia with the sea by a section passing wholly through Turkish territory, and having its terminus in non-Persian ter ritory, a state of things contrary to the interests of Persia generally. On the other hand the principal shrines of the Shi * ehfaitii lire ciooa to Baghdad, and thus uven the passanger traffic on tlie hhanfqin v/ill bo in itj/s@lf a sourco of profit# As regards goods taaffic: from haglidad the stream of ex ports from Persia will inevitably flow towards the Uulf in tho main, and imports will follow tills route for the most part, whether the Persian Gulf Baghdad Hallway be constructed or not? it may be assumed therefore that the Baghdad-i.armanshah line will be remunerative from the first, even though it be subject to the competition of the huristan line, which would deprive it of a considerable portion of its goods traffic, and a part of its passenger traffic* Being shorter, and for the whole of its length in Persian soil, thus avoiding furAiah dues and exactions. the Luristan line will have an initial advantage which no reason able adjustment of rates on the furbish line could entirely neutralize• hven at present the weight of goods imported to and exported iron Harman shah via idianicjin aggregates nearly nearly 50,000 tone* I conclude therefore that the Luristan line would have a markedly unfavourable but not ruinous effect on the X J ersian Gulf-Baghdad line, and to a much less degree on the Baghdad Hallway as a whole# Its construction might so reduce the pros pective traffic on the Persian Gulf-Baghdad railway as to make it impossible for the latter to earn enough to bo financially profitable for some years to come, or until Irrigation on a large scale has been introduced vnd extended in Mesopotamia, thus robbing the line of its attraction to investors* / I cannot, however, believe that the construction of the Ui- ristan line will for long postpone the realisation of the Bagh- dad-Gulf project, nor permanently damage tho financial prospects of the latter; its affects are likely, however, to be sufficient ly to make the threat of its conotruction a valuable lever whan negotiating with Germany or Turkey. The value of tho line as a lever vill be email, however, n (1) The number of pilgrims from Persia who passed idianiqin in 1905 WaS 96 »°00,in 1910,55,000, according to Turkish quarantine statistics; a considerable increase may be expected ^ A ^ . , , ,, as a result of railway oon- ■ strhetion on this line# Junless prolonged beyond ivliurrajnabcid to tlio grout commeroitil centres of which Hamadan is the chief, or at least as far as Burujird. From Basrah to Baghdad by rail (350) miles is no further than from Kohammerah to hhurramabad, and the former linr will undoubtedly be cheaper to construct than the latter. I have suggested (paragraph 9) a rate of £4 a ton as the cheapest average rate we can afford to charge on goods between Mohammerah and Ahurramabad. how does this compare with the ac tual river rates and prospective railway rates between Baghdad and Basrah ? The following tables may throw some light on the point:- Statement showing freights charge*)in 1 ( . 10 on goods between Basrah &amp; Baghdad and vice versa.

The average K.W. Railway (India) rate of 4.72 pies per ton per mile if applied to the Baghdad-Basrah line would work out at £0-ll~5-f a ton: the average Indian rate of 5.5 pies per ton per mile would work out at £0-13-6:' per ton* The conclusion I draw from these figures is that if Rhur- ramabad is to be the distributing centre and terminus of the Luristan line it will not be able to compete with Baghdad, which has great initial advantages over a small isolated town li^e Ahurramabad• In order to fulfil its object the line must be prolonged at all events as far as Burujird, We have not given up all hope of participating in the Baghdad-Basrah railway, the construction of which is of the greatest importance to us as a sot*off to the Constantinople Baghdad line, which will tend to alienate Mesopotamia from the principal seats of our commercial and political influence in the Middle East. Until we are forced to abandon hope of re taining a predominant share in such a line, it would seem tobe against our interests to ta*e any active steps towards the construction of a burlstan line, which is in itself politically and perhaps strategically objectionable, and which may ultimate- ly projuciic© our* interests in i-esopotar,iia, Even were we to pursue the scheme, however, the necessity for us to join/building the Baghdad-dasrah line would be none tne less imperative, in the interests of our position in Meso- tf/ero we to build a railway from Moh&amp;mmerah to Dizful (a line costing but little and with every prospect of paying its way at metre gauge eventually if the feeder roads to the North were built and properly organised) and to reserve to ourselves the right to extend it to rdiurramabad, we should prevent any possibility oi railway enterprise by other nations in this re gion, and at the same time retain in our hands a valuable lever to force the Turks to give us a predominant share in the Tigris Valley Railway Company when it come#| to be formed. It is scarcely necessary to add that there is no point Couth of -uhurramabad except Dizful which could be made a ter minus of the projected line, and the suggestions of the Russian uovernment in this connection are quite impracticable. The superior advantages of the Luristan railway over the Baghdad-Earmanshah project from the point of view of the Persian Government, if the former is alternative to and not k® in ad dition to the latter, is so strong as to need no laboured de monstration. It is to Persia^ interest that her exports and imports should flow in channels wholly within her borders and under her control, and that all the indirect benefits following on the establishment of an important port should accrue to her and not to the Turkish croverument. It is to her interest to strengthen her hold upon her S.Ww provinces, and no more power ful interest than the railway now under discussion could be de pot arai a 4. Attitude of the Persian Government sired for the purpose. No alignment between the Northern end of the Gulf and Weste r nEastern Persia^ by .vhich I mean the country of which xvarmanshah and Harr) ad an are the centres, will suit the Central Government | equally well. The next best, from her point of view, would be | a Hoi A aramerah-Ispah&amp;n line, bmt this has boen pronounced after careful expert examination by iiajor ./.R.Morton, R.l., to pre sent prohibitive physical obstacles to a cart road, from which j it may be inferred that a railway is likewise impracticable. The rescript of Hasr-ud-Din Shall in reference to a Tehran- Shushtar railway is well known and need not be further referred to. The Persian Government may be expected, I conclude, ulti mately to favour the project, though great difficulty will doubtless be met with in obtaining a concession on anything I like equitable terms. It will probably be difficult to recon cile the rights of the Shaikh cf hohananerah in the matter, as I guaranteed to him by us, with the claims and pretensions of the Persian Government. 5. Probable effect of proposed railway on British political, stra tegical and commercial interests . On this subject the view which I respectfully submit be low may be summarised by saying that the prospect is unattract ive as a commercial speculation and its political disadvantages which, are ultimately largely commercial ones, outweigh&gt; in my belief, any advantage which it may afford to our commerce in West Persia: strategically the line would appear to be of small importance to us. The arguments against the cosntruction of a line connect ing Arabistan with W# Persia may be summarised as follows:- We are already strongly established in Arabistan, with sufficient security for ouU trade, and with every opportunity for increasing it by extension of oil works, irrigation, etc. Whilst a light railway to Dizful would undoubtedly assist the development of the province (as would also the Luristan road from Dizful to Hurujird), the Aarun at present provides a sufficientlym&gt; 7J sufficiently good channel ao far as Shushtar for local require ments, and as regards Dizful there is nothin to prevent the utilization of the Diz for that purpose to within 20 miles of that to.m # fhe Luristan line will contribute but little to the development ox Arab!stan (Mohammerah of course being ex cluded) as the agricultural products of the province must al ways go south, not north, by boat and not by rail, and it is iroza the bouth that the vast bulk of its needs must be sup plied: if under international and not British control, the line may lead to an actual dinaiinution of our prestige and to all sorts of complications with the bhaikh. hussia’s economic and political progress southwards has hitherto been checked by tlie Zagros mountains: if these be pierced by a railway our position in Arabistan will be weakened, and there is nothing to show that we shall obtain anything like adequate compensation in the markets of d.Persia, in which ' 4 British goods greatly preponderate at present, and are likely * 4 to do so at all events until harmanshah is joined up with Baghdad. The following figures for the foreign trade of Hamadan supplied by the Manager of the Imperial ^ank of Persia may be considered, I think, to support this contention. britiah trade . United Aingdom: piece goods, £850,000 (worth about £100 a ton) India : spices, copperware, tea, cotton yarn, thread, indigo £180,000. Total British trade £1,050,000. Russian trade. Bugar £ 80,000 Oil 10,000 Glass, hardware, etc. 5,000 Iron from Ardabil 6,000 Cheap prints, etc. 7,000 £108,000 Germany, America &amp; France . Drugs, woollens, fancy goods synthetic indigo 100,000 Turkey . Skins, figs, dates 52,000 lotal foreign trade £240,000! 'I n M v It The construction of the railway would probably cause a ^ displacement of Hussian /il by the products of the Anglo- PeBsian oil Company, and of HuBaian sugar and hardware by the produce of Western Europe, but it seems that British trade would only benefit by the general improvement in commerce that may be expected to follow upon the construction of the line, I do not forget that it is British firms who may be ex pected to import sugar and hardware in displacement of Russian products, thus enabling them to increase their exports, but 1 do not tuinh that the prospective profits under this head are likely to be sufficient to affect materially the situation as I have depicted it. We have built up considerable commercial interests in Arabiatan under the security provided by the strong and auto nomous regime of the Shaikh of Mohammerah# A railway connect ing Irabistan with W.Persia can scarcely fail to weaken his powers, without bringing to him or to us any counterbalancing advantage, xiis rent roll will be somewhat swelled, it is true, but that will not compensate him for the destruction of the geographical isolation of his territories from the rest tff Persia which will follow the construction of the railway. As for the Turks, he would sooner deal with them single-handed than with the aid of such a two-edged weapon as the armed assistance of the Persian Government. The temporary extension of the Persian Government’s in fluence and maleficent administrative activity to ^Arabiatan from 1880 to 1895 was synchronous with a period of almost con tinuous disorder, which so hampered British commercial enter prise in the provinces that the opening of the x^arun remained for years almost without effect and our trade was nearly stran gled, and is only now beginning to recover from the effects of that treatment. This state of things ceased only when Shaikh xdiaz’al by his wise and farseaing policy contrived to emanci pate himself from the arbitrary interference of the Persian Government, patriarchically and without molestation, so long asas ho paid the Government revenue regularly, vrhloh he has done over since. There is no reason whatever to suppose that an extension oi' the Persian Government's facilities for inter ference will not have precisely the same effect in the future as in the past. fhe projected line will in no way meet Indian passenger traffic or mail requirements, and the advantage which it will b© secure to our commerce in Central Persia will presumably /neu tralized to a large extent by Russian railway construction ad vancing Jl&amp;ri passu from the North. The construction of the Baghdad-carmanshah line, if we have a predominant share in the Baghdad-Gulf section, will assist our commerce in an almost degree and leave us relatively to Russia xn much the same po sition we at present occupy in the markets of Central Persia. -i-inally, it seems improbable that the Persian Government could itself permanently secure the safety of the railway if built, or even the freedom of the construction from molestation by the tribesmen: we might easily be called on to send troops to Rhurramabad to protect the line from d ;struction/and it is not endangered thereby. International interference with the same object would be even more obnoxious to us. This objec tion applies, it is tx’ue, to road/ construction in Buristan, but in the latter case the capital involved is comparatively quite small, and the amount of damage that can be done less. 6. Bucli are some of the arguments which may be urged against th* railway apart from its financial aspects, which are dealt with below (paragraph 9). In favour of the line it may be urged that the Baghdad-Barmanshah line, connected as it is with Basrah by river only, is not suited to convey agricultural produce to the sea, that it will not sufficiently develop the export trade which will be hampered by transit dues, and it is upon an in creased export trade that we must reply to obtain any substan tial increase in the volume of our imports. It may further be said that Turkish obstruction may be counted on as a cer tainty, and that we shall in practice be unable to guarantee thatOr S*$ that freight rates will not be manipulated to our disadvantage, J aB in the cas9 of ^9 Hamburg-Amerlka lino. Put if these ob- ! j point nS 0an b6 SatiBf,aotoril y laat ' of the necessity from | our/of view of the Luristan line, would seem to disappear. Control of the Baghdad section should suable us to prevent differential rates on the uh&amp;niqin Karmsnahah extension. It may bo pointed out that the Mohammerah line is vastly superior from the point of view of purely Persian interests, and that our oil industry in S.W.Persia will benefit by the line, and stress may be laid on the rapid increase of trade that will follow the construction of the railroad: this is undoubtedly a good argument, but it presupposes the restora tion and maintenance of order in S.W.Persia, a consummation still far distant, specially in Luristan. xo a large extent moreover, the Baghdad- a armanshah rail way will have the same effect, at a minimum of expense and with- ; out the political and financial risks that, it has been sug gested, a railway may involve. As regards the effect of the railway upon the Chaikh of Mohammerah, it may be held that as in the past, so in the future, he will adapt himself to altered circumstances find, with ouj support, maintain his present position vis a vis the Persian Government. An investigation of this point, however, involves too remote the discussion of probabilities and contingencies/for consi deration within the limits of this report. 7./ It nay be urged that for strategical reasons connected 'with the defence of India, it is undesirable that a connection should be made by rail between Central Persia and the head of the Per sian culf, but such considerations apply ith greater force to the Trans-Persian railway, Giich, it is understood, has been accepted in principle by the Government of India, subject to proper safeguards. In any case, as long as we have naval pre- dominance in the Gulf, the Luristan Hailway can have little j value to Russia, more particularly if Its terminus be at -ioharn- j morah up the Ghatt-^-Arab river and not at .Jirr Ansa. ItA 1 9 it may also be argued, on the other hand, that”the time fay come *hen the power of rapidly moving a force to Tehran or its neighbourhood by so short a route from India may be of great advantage' (Memo, by Major Baird, D.S.O., dated 5th June 1907, printed by Chief of Staffs Division India). Such pros pective value to us seems, however, very problematic, as also its military value to Russia, .and I do not think that we need have any serious apprehensions as to the strategical effect of the line upon our position in the Gulf. My ftumble opinion, after weighing the advantages and dis advantages of the Luristan line, is that the best course for U3 would be to build the Mohaamerah-Dizful railway as soon as possible, and connoct at once by a well-built road to “l^l ■■ abad and burujird. ! i rrom Dizful to Hazn&amp;dan by road is about 250 miles from Baghdad to iiamadan about 325. -Me shall then, be able to land goods at Hamadan at all events as cheaply via bizful as we are now able to do via Baghdad, and far more expeditiously. When the railway is completed as far as Baghdad we should then and not till then, start on the Dizful-ihiurrainabad section, in an ticipation of the prolongation to hhaniqi n being built, should we by this time have been forced to give up hope of controlling tho Baghdad section, predominance on which would render the construction of the Luristan line, in my view, superfluous, in view of the political objections to it. It would pi obably^^pj^AhateAy be to the advantage of both f, ourselves and Russia to prevent Hallway construction in Persia | ior another ten years, but as Germany seems to have succeeded in compelling Russia to abandon this policy, the course I have outlined above seems to offer the fewest objections. It in- remunerative volves no large outlay and would probably be financially / j before long: it also mahes no great addition to our commitments I in this part of Persia. 8 . (1) There Is, I understand, a possibility of the main line passing through uhuni qln to Baghdad.tyaugo of proposed railway . Je may assume that for our purposes there aro three pos- srble gauges, 5*, and metre gauge. There would seem at first sight to be good prima facie grounds for choosing the Russian (b’.O') gauge, which would facilitate the prolongation „ to be iron iJiurramabad to Burujird, which I believe/essential to the success of the line, and the extensions thence to some point or points on the Russian railway from the forth when it comes to be constructed. But I have submitted in the succeeding paragraph that it is only^ouilding the line to metre gauge that a we can ever hope to maRe it/financially sound proposition. Thi argument should suxiice to outweigh^ any objection by Russia against the break of gauge, which is in itself strategically most desirable* The financial argument has the additional ad vantage of enabling us to put forward strong reasons for a break of gauge on the border of the neutral zone no less than on that of the British zone. The 4 , aj' gauge, as used on the Baghdad railway, enables a high rate of speed to be attained by heavy trains, but it is financially objectionable, and would be so on strategical grounds should the Teh/ran Rhaniqin line be built to this gauge. The £*6” gauge advocated by Sir T.R.eordon is, 1 would sub mit, too small to be economical; it has only been adopted in India for a few hill railways of exceptional difficulty and some feeder lines in Southern India. The metre gauge is much the cheapest and can be ^ised with sharper curvature than the broader gauges: the rate of speed ig slower a. h the maximum load that a train can carry is less. As the hurlstan line is never likely to be a mail or main passenger line, the slower Xim speed seems unimportant; and as regards the traffic it could carry^through I can profess no expert knowledge on the subject, tot. I venture to record my belief that a metre gauge will be ample for the requirements of the country for the next 26 years at any rate, rutting the train loa^at the low figure of 400 tons, one train a day would dealI deal with 150,000 tons a year, with in the next paragraph# j-his question ic further dealt Whilst considering the rcetre gauge for financial and stra tegical reasons in every way preferable, 1 have nevertheless estimated for a broad gauge line, whilst adding estimates for metre gauge as far as I am able to deduce them, 9. Financial prospects of the line . The estimates of cost of the line (5*0' gauge) are based on the same classification as that adopted by ^r.John for the Baluchistan line, which provided for 5'S' gauge, 62 lbs.rails, wooden sleepers, and a small quantity of rolling stock, sta- I tions etc., on a moderate scale# Iron sleepers would, however, be undoubtedly necessary, owing to the prevalence of white ants and the temptation to theft which wooden sleepers would offer i to the tribes. The details of the proposed alignments and their estimated cost will be found in Part II and III of this report. They may be summarised as follows:- (converted into £ fromif) Miles 5 , .Q M gauge Mohammerah-Dizful 174 £633,533 £6395 per metre gauge £4460 per mile ) mile Dizful-ivhurraraabad 185 1,700,000^ Totals 359 2,333,333 1,640,000 Via nashgan gorge Mohammerah-Dizful 174 633,333 . | 7657 * w 5350 „ M Di z ful 140 1,871,000 Totals 314 2,404,336 1,685,000I was unavoidably provontod by heavy floods and disturbanc from examining the nashgan gorge in detail: it is not improbable tnat expert examination will prove it to bo no more expensive ing to my tentative figures, cheaper, though harder, to build, 43 miles longer and of steeper gradient. On the assumption that the cost would diminish proportionate- £ ly to the gauge (though I beli^re that it is the general expe rience of railway engineers that the reduction of cost is not as a rule proportionately equal to the reduction in gauge) the cost of the two alignments by metre gauge would be approximately as shown above* The cost per mile as shown on the above table may be com pared with the payments made by the Turkish uovernmeht to the Baghdad railway Company for each kilomtre built i*e, £10,764 in bonds per kilometre, equivalent to about £13,#00 in cash faking first the .case of the S l 0 M gauge, let us assume the total cost to be £2,350,000 for the purpose of discussion, which I would preface by disclaiming any pretence at expert knowledge* Considering the circumstances of the railway interest^ sinking fundjrf charges and royalties to the Persian Covernnent could scarcely be less than £ 200,000 a year or £ 576 a mile* This is 8.8 c /o of which I allow interest at 5^$, sinking fund at 2^ and Q% or £18,000 or £5 per i.iile for royalties to the Persian Uovernment. To earn this sum groes receipts totalling some thing like £640,000 or nearly £1800 a mile must be earned assuming the ratio of gross receipts to net receipts to be as three is to one n ly speaking. At an average rate of about 3 d. a ton per mile or £4 a ton from kohammerah to ^hurram- abad, about 170,000 tons must be handled to earn this sum, the (1) Gross receipts of about £228 a mile (ISCjj&amp;a kilometre) are guaranteed in the case of Baghdad railway. # (2) The maximum freights authorized on the Baghdad railway are as follows per mile. a) vast a)vast proportion of whihii must be through traffic. I ignore raceipts u.roiu passanger traffic as unliicely to pay evon the running expenses of passenger trains: a couple of coaches attached to a goods train v/iil probably be all that is required for some time to come. It is difficult to see any prospect of more than half the amount of goods traffic required being avail able for transportation by rail for the next t.venty years at | all events. The rate of £4 a ton to ^hurramabad may seem a high one, but it must be remembered that the Turkish duty of is equi valent to a duty of more than £1 a ton on piece goods (when additional Turkish charges are taken into account) and probably not less than two shillings a ton on wheat: in estimating the incidence of freights, therefore, these sums should be deducted from the rates charged on the Luristan line. 11 . tre_ jrauge. If metre gauge were adopted, net receipts would have to be about £140,000 a year, at the same rate, and gross receipts £1^0,000, necessitating the handling of ever 100,000 tons of goods per annum. The weights of imports and exports via kermanshah in 1910- 1911 were roughly as follows Imports 42,000 tons Exports 3,000 H 45,000 tons. Allowing for goods smuggled for personal property, the total probably amounts to over 50,000 tons. Of this quantity only 25$ is for local use, the rest being forwarded mainly to iiamadan for distribution. The products of the ivarmanshah and Hamadan districts are mainly exported to Hussia at present : a (2) Cont.

One ox the disadvantages of the Luristan line is that it would obtain very little internal goods traffic cihv tile itrabiBtan ©xports go ooutli to tli© soa, and. tii© Foquiro— ments of the province aremainly eupplied locally or from India, There is practically no exchange of commodities between this province and the rest of Persia, whereas ti ere is a very large internal trade between carmanshah, uamadan, Tabriz, Qasvin, lehran, etc., amounting to about million sterling per annum in the case of Hamadan. ? There is therefore reason to believe that eventually, the bulk of goods transported would suffice to make a metre gauge j railway pay: since 30,000 tons of the Karmanshah imports and exports would probably be available at once, and a further 20,000 tons of exports now sent to Russia may be expected to adopt this line; thus giving us at once half the total re quired to make the railway oqii'tgi^d .raidwary pay its way. The project therefore, though unattractive as a commercial speculation seems a sound one, though some sort of guarantee at first would appear inevitable: the Persian Government is obviously unable to give one: whether the situation justifies the British Government in doing so is a question beyond my competence, but I have already submitted that the railway is politically disadvantageous to us. Mr, Greenway in his letter of the 7th January 1911 to the Foreign Office states definitely that a Government guarantee will be necessary because of the insecurity of the country. To turn now to the question of a cart-road between Dizful and idiurramabad and Burujird. ‘^he approximate length of a cart-road via Pul-i-nurr J#a Dukhtar and Madian Rud would be From Dizful to idiurramabad 154 miles. to Burujird 220 H A metalled road suitable to carry heavy motor traffic, withwith a nuling gradient of 1 in 25 to 1 in 30 with suitable seraie and post-houses and a telegraph line alongside, is what is wanted. We shall , I think bo on tho safe side in estimating the average cost of such a road at not more than £600 a mile all , (D included except the telegraph line. Such a road should be able to handle expeditiously if properly organized, all the traffic likely to offer for a long time to comei the capital involved is much less than that necessary for a railway, the prospect of it being damaged by tribesmen less, and the possible profits larger* Further discussion of this subject is not, however, ger mane to thepresent report, and I confine myself to suggesting with great respect that the possibility is one deserving of close examination at the hands of experts. (See also piirt 5) The Russian native fegent in Burujird, in a detailed con fidential report to his Consul at aarmanshah, to which I ob tained access when in the former to ,n, reported that the im ports of Russian goods into Rurujird (part of which were des tined for ^hurramabad) aggregated £52,000 in value. Ramadan was the depot from which tiie needs of the dis trict were supplied in all cases. The principal articles were (in order of importance) piece-goods, sugar, kerosine, matches, hardware, tea and glass ware, but the value under each category was not given. There is no doubt that the sugar and kerosine were of Russian origin and also the glassware and perhaps the bulk of the hardware, but the matches in use in Burujird are Swedish and Austrian not Russian, though imported through Russia by Russian merchants. As regards piece-goods, the vast proportions,are undoubtedly of British make, though Russian patterns are closely imitated. (1) Approximate cost of telegraph line ay be taken at not over k'600 a mile.M r. Maomurray of the imperial BimJc of Persia, Hamadan, re ports on the 29th March 1911, that 'nothing competes with Man chester goods here except a white material, which comes from looms in India”* Matches, hardware and glassware are commercially of little importance and as things now stand therefore, the only articles of importance which Russia now supplies and which we should furnish if the railway were built are oil and sugar. The for mer will shortly bo produced by the Oil Company at -ohammerah or Qasr-i-ohirin, but the total consumption of this product within Persia is likely to be but small for some years,to come. Tuo sugar now imported is at present almost entirely foreign, but there seems good reason to hope that before long British sugar may compete successfully in this market. Piece goods being unbreakable, compact, and of a high value relatively to their wjlght, are better suited to mule transport than are the other important commodities which Per sia imports, and tiie advent of the railway will not largely improve our txiade in this direction, as we supply practically tixe whole i W# Persia to the exclusion of Russian imports.batw©an Ah^az .aid of ^aritali Irrigition scheme In placo of proaant rivar on unsinbitioua noaauro aati- ata&amp;yaaro, whoaa diopXuaatwit ■ 'ould alo^jr away for utili zation of n&amp;run waters for irrigation: tlx a -.arun irriga tion uGhmne f however, ia gan@- rally ctimid rod, apart froru Uda, to bo maprofitable, md ito ooist (.d)00,000) ia so great aa to na&amp;o its inooption impoe&amp;ible* suffer frozs competition of river traffic, a a merciuint# rdgbt ship goods to AUwas for forwurdmezit thence oititor by rail or via the biz to 1 oh liana or.

There is a general concensus of opinion, with whihh I am in full agreement, that Bast of the Kiyalan route no practi cable alignment even for a mule track can be found: the idea which has been prominently mooted in the public press, of se lecting an alignment via the Ab-i-Biz valley must therefore be dismissed at once as impracticable# Bir Henry Rav/linson from (1Q44) writes of it/personal experience as follows 'From the fang-i-Bahrain (B#K# of Burujird) the Dizful 'river forces its way through a succession of chasms and 'gorges, and the track along its bank is utterly impract icable. indeed, this part of the Zagros is so very pre cipitous that there is only one single pathway conduct- 'ing across it from Dizful to Burujird: it is followed by 'nomads on foot, it is not to be traversed by a horseman, 'and is considered the most difficult of all mountain path ways. It breaks into the Sahra-i-hur (H. of Dizful) bet- 'ween the hill forts of Tangawan and Qal Ch-i-Shahi' . Major Bell (1884) and Major Sawyer (1889) (the latter surveyed much of the district) confirm these conclusions, as also does Ld. DeMorgan (1891) from personal experience (£.107 Vol.il). On the other hand the adoption of any alignment West of the Saidmarreh-huh-i-Dasht line, would increase the length of the railway out of all proportion to any economy that might be secured thereby: and in any case I am satisfied that the b aidmarreh-or oloo tiia t\txah$zm ?iQr&amp;® rout® ia tho oa®i®s»t tlu&amp;t Qm b® round* .antion aaouXa parh.ipa bo tmdo of a poaalbla rout® via tlx© aaotam br aidh of tna Ab-i-Dia (tlirowh war© Jazxiuwi) but ovon/tMo branch not put out of court by roaaon of it© groator iongfch, Major Mawyor 1 © v#rdiot ia again©t it* U) **&amp;*&gt; lavoi rivor bad rood, aiielx is ©aid to hnva passed * through tliis gap f axid tr&amp;oo® or rhioJj ?say ba soon at n iias5nain my b© oofialdarod to u-o/o IMMU .M old world rout® tt before the nor** noi^dorn gap of *4iurr asabixd was brought ”into uua* Tit® lattor is perhaps bettor suited for th® ^demand© of th® ixanodiato futui-o; for Utough it hue the * comparative drawback of being on a higher level than, the w river course of the Ab^i-hurujird, for inotano®, the * latter jaight # owing to its nuiaerou® Aorg#© -.*nd preoi- M pitoua bm&amp;a, raquira greater Initial o«penao» to ro- **ccivo a civilisod road or rail”* xhlc ©ond donation ©|&gt;pll®® equally to both br^tnoixos of the &amp;tz above bi&amp;ful* Acting upon tiieso premioes l first of all examined tiia country of tii© nuahgan with a vi'sw to finding a suitable alignitontj disaatiufied with the result, -hioh worked out, as will b© soon later on, at over hXh,OQO a nilo, for 184 mile®, X proceeded to invootigate 'the country west of the jutshgaa river^ and found a much bettor txlignr.ont eetimted at 185 mile© at about £9,100 a mile* .rno first ”ruling pcint* which any alignment must no- ©#©aarlXy touch is the Abyl-hal, whore it travorcc® tlx© plain of i&amp;l*gth~i»Kl&amp;/** This c.-m be r &gt;aoIied froru hixful via hul~ i-^hui or ual 1 ch-i-diucttialyeh* -ho formor route is slier ter but uiore dixx icult • it traverse© no great el© vat ion, hal-»i«» hai (1700*) being Ui« highest point touched, but from hulaih onwaa^da for practically th,o whole of its length it oroeaes a HI * — — Kecorvmlceano© in Bafeshtiari Country u* &lt;# Paroia 1801 Part X P.13*n— auooesaion of low ridges separated by ravines often from 50* ' to 100' deep, and a railway would involve alternate deep cut tings, lofty embankments and bridges, the lengths of 'sur- lace line being not more than 2 miles betv/een llu^uoih and the Raza plain# I recommend the Qal'eh Husainiyeh alignment therefore and will proceed to describe its general features* 35. First ejection, bizmi (700 •) Dukuh (900») 12 miles. a gentle rise of 20 to 30 feet per miles throughout, increasing slightly near Du|z(iaih. For the first 6 miles as far as Salihabad undulating well cultivated ground, cultivated in places. Numerous small irrigation canals near balihabad. The formation is conglomerate, with a thin covering of soil, or debris from the bala Rud and nub-i-Tangawan. From Faliha- bad onwards the ground is stony and the line suggested crosses many small water-courses,dry except immediately after rain, bringing down quantities of debris from the hills. The best alignment, I should say, would pass the ancient tanxs known as bo Hauzan, and would enter the low hills at Du^kuh about 3 miles i£. of the Bala Rud. Coat . This section may be classed, following Mr.John's esti mate, as M eaey line” at if90,000 a mile for 6 miles 'surface line at R5Q,Q0C for 6 miles, xotal R°B40,000* Bmall culverts and revetments will frequently be necessary; ballast every where available: embankments will be expensive, where neces sary, as there is little soil, the ground being mainly bould ers and gravel. Building stone not available: bricks will be cheaper and easily obtainable (of square tile shape) in Eizful. 36 • Second section . Mukuh (900*) to ( pal'eh-i-Riza (1550») 23 miles. ( Approximate along proposed alignment ). Major Bell (1884) apropos of cart road construction re marked of this section that H the amount of road making to be “donemmmammmmmm 'dono, zigzagging in and out of ravinos, between a few miles ”:i* of Qal^h Husainiyeh (1150*) and the Bidrubeh plain v/ill 'oxceed that in any equal distance between Dizful and hhur- 'ramabad”• Betv;een these points the track winds its way amongst in tricate hills, of no great elevation, composed of sand-stones topped with a hard conglomerate in places: it constantly cross es ravines from 50* to 100* in depth. Without a detailed sur vey of this section it is impossible to suggest any particular alignment* I satisfied myself, however, by a bird , s ey© view from Bard-i-Balleh and other points, that it cannot toe cir cumvented. Three ravines about 100* deep are crossed, and about 20 smaller ones averaging 50*. From Bidrubeh onwards to Qal'eh Riza (3 miles) the alignment should present no dif ficulties: by keeping H. of the present traek, not far from tlie foot of the limestone hills to the North, there should be no difficulty in obtaining a good though costly alignment of say 1 in 75 to 1 in 100. The Bala Rud must be bridged somewhere between Du^kuh and Qal*-eh Husainiyeh. The average breadth of the ravine in which it rims is about 300* at bottom and about 60* deep. The whole section will oef difficult and expensive one to survey and to construct. No great difficulty is to be anti cipated in regard to the gradient, as the route rises steadily from Du}£kuh to Qal'eh Husainiyeh (ilb0 , ) with an average d£©*rt of 30* to 40* to the mile. No difficulty should be thus experienced in obtaining a gradient of 1 in 100, though heavy cutting and embanking, and bridges of some height must be looked*' for throughout. By increasing the ruling gradient to 1 in 50 some saving would no doubt accrue, but it would convert the railway into a switchback, so narrow in section are the ridges to bo traversed. I do not think tunneling could be usefully A resorted to at any point. Between Qal’eh Husainiyeh (IISO 1 ) and Qal^h Riza (1650 1 ) 14 miles, the highest point that the railway would have to traverse is about 1700*, 4 miles from Qal* eha / Qal*eh Hiza, i.- C_ost.

I select Ahmad Kuchikeh as the end of this section because it is a ruling point through '/hich any alignment must pass, being the lowest point of a saddle formed by an extension of the slopes of the nadir null across the valley: the Saidmarreh river forces its way through the obstacle thus placed in its way by a deep gorge: the edge of the ravine being some 200* higher than the proposed alignment* Between Qal^eh Hiza and Pul-i-Tang (9 miles) two alterna tive alignments present themselves: the first keeps to the northern side of the Qal’eh Hiza plain, crosses the Zal just below the point where it enters the plain, near an ancient (probably Bassanian) high level bridge or aqueduct and keeps to the foot of the gypsum hills, crossing the Ab-i-Tirada, and four large ravines, till it debouches on to the gentle lime stone slopes near Pul-i-Tang* The advantages of this alignment are (1) it does not des cend below 1350 * (2) it is probably one mile shorter than the alternative route: (3) it does not cross the Saidmarreh: (4) a gradient of 1 in 100 could in all probability be obtained, though at great cost: its disadvantages are (l) not less than six bridges of some size: (2) heavy cutting for about 2 miles, alternatively with heavy embankments, (3) awkward curves round gypsum spurs, (4) hills traversed between lirada and Pul-i-Tang are^5 obtained without difficulty.

Fourth Section . Ahmad Kuchikeh (1950*) to Ab-i-Fani (1600*) 15 mx1e s. Ab-i-Fani may be taken as the next ruling point beyond Ahmad Kuchikeh: its height where it joins the Saidmarreh is 1500^ where it issues from the gorge through Kiyalan Kuh 1700*. The distance for railway purposes may be taken as 15 miles. Prom Ahmad Kuchikeh there is a steady descent down the Jauzar valley till at about 5 miles the Saidmarreh is reached at the point where it enters the long gorge, the South end of which is Pul- i-Tang height here 1400*: there is therefore a fall of 450* in 5 miles to be negotiated. If the line be taken along the limestone slopes between the Jauzar stream and the Saidmarreh gorge there will be no difficulty in giving an even gradient, andand curvature will be easy, but it will be difficult to get gradient much better than 1 in 00, 1 in 100 could be attained but at considerable expense, by following the outlines of the foot hills of Kiyalan Kuh, only touching the 1400 * level near the Lailum stream, but the curves will be awkward, the length of line probably one mile at least greater, and the work dif ficult and expensive* As 1 in 50 will be unavoidable in sub sequent sections, I propose the former alignment: it passes over gentle limestone slopes with no difficult features such as spurs or ravines* The next five miles to the Ab-i-Lailum lie along the Saidmarreh valley, near the river* The Lailum stream can be crossed m. above its junction with the river: height of stream here 1500*, banks 50* higher: width from bank to bank 300*: fordable: rocky bottom: width of stream average 200*: water slightly bitter, not over l^” deep in summer* From Lailum to the Fani stream, 5 m. the best alignment seems to be close to the river: easy throughout except at 15 m. where there is an awkward sput abutting on the Saidmarreh: it would involve heavy cutting. As regards cost, I think this section may fairly be classed as follows:- Easy 5 m. § Kl,25,000 &amp; 6,25,000 Medium hilly in rock 8 m. 9 1,50,000 12,00,000 Heavy ghat line 2 m. 9 1,75,000 3,50,000 1^21,75,000 39* We have now reached the point where the alignments res pectively £• and W, of the Kashgan river commence to diverge* I went over the eastern alignment via Dalich and Dadabad with care, surveying it throughout: as, however, I rejected it in favour of a line along or West of the Kashgan, it seems unnecessary to trouble Government with a detailed description of it* I’ will therefore confine myself to an abstract of the length and cost of this line, as estimated by me:- Total sections one to four 64 miles 88,65,000 Section 5 Ab-i.-Fani-Chul 21 ' 34,75,000 ^^The detailed notes of this alignment are on record in the Bushire Residency.Section 6 Chul-foot of Dalich 26 miles R 8 55,00,000 n 7 Ab-i-Sard-Ghimashk 17 ff 29.50.000 22.75.000 73 , 00,000 m 8 Chimashk 15 ' ti 9 Dadabad-Khurramabad 40 w 184 w 1^3,34,65,000 = £ 2,231,000 average over £12,000 a mile. Railway gradient 1 in 50. Curvature difficult: 200 yards radius the best that can be hoped for in many places. 40. The Hadian Rud alignment. West of the Rashgan . I will now proceed to describe the alternative alignment west of the Rashgan river, to which I turned my attention as soon as I had reached Khurramabad by the route described above. It diverges from the alignment first described at the end of the fourth section, the totals up to this point being miles 64 costing R^SS^S^OO. Before describing this section I may remark that a gorge line up the Kashgan to Dureh is probably practicable but I have not been able to go fully into the question as the Kashgan was not fordable and the track which runs up the Rashgan valley crosses the river constantly. An alignment up the gorge, as far as I can make out, after examining it for 6 miles above Pul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar and at Tang-i-Tir and near Pul-i-Kalhur would be a very expensive gorge line, with 15 or 20 bridges of 100* or so each over the Kashgan. We may estimate the cost at 3 lakhs a mile for 60 miles = 180 lakhs: this compares rather unfavourably with the Gulgul Madian Rud alignment des cribed below, but the possibility is well worth careful exam ination when the time comes, xhis alignment is dealt with In paragraph 46. 41. Fifth S e ction. Ab-i~Fani (1400*) to mout h of Tang-i-Khirsdarr , (2100 1 ) 20 miles (approximately by alignment along Saidmar reh and Kashgan ^rivers) to Jaidar This«Lnis will be a difficult and expensive section: gradient on the average easy, not more than 1/75. The line would fol low the general line of the Saidmarreh river to where it is joined by the Kashgan, below Pul Garnishan: thence up the Kash- gan valley to the mouth of the Tang-i-hhirsdarr, within which lies the ruins of a splendid Sassanian bridge, known as the Pul Kurr o Dukhtar or Pul Shapur. I think I shall be within the mark if I class it as H heavy ghat w at If if lakhs a mile for 20 miles. xotal for 5th section £&gt;35,00,000 miles 20 Grand Total £123,65,000 ' 84 Sixth Section. Mo uth of Tang-i-Khir sdarr (2199 1 ) t o top of gan£-i~Millehdar on R umi shgan jpdain_(4100 *) 19 miles . This will be the most difficult pe^ce on this alignment, for it is here that we ascend on to the Luristan plateau, a rise of 2000* in 19 miles. The Tang-i-Khirsdarr is accessible from the South, it may be noted, only on foot, unless the Kashgan is fordable. There is a possibility that the alignment for a metre gauge railway would be easier up the Tang-i-Jihirsdarr and the Pam Pariz valley than via Millehdar as now described. 1 have submitted a separate report regarding the suitability of the former alignment for a cart road. The alignment I suggest runs along the slopes of -^uh Maleh, rising steadily on a gradient of about 1 in 50. This hill is a saddle back: slope of rook on southern side 15° to 20°: for mation very hard limestone: face of hill but little furrowed by water courses, and contour lines very straight. The track will have to be made by blasting and revetting the whole way. I shall, I hope, be on the safe side in allowing two lakhs a mile for this section. Total for 6th Section £38,00,000 miles 19 Add for Kashgan bridge 2,00,000 Total £40,00,000 Grand Total £161,65,000 miles 103. 43«— 43 • §ev^it h_S_eotion. Top of Tang; MillQhdar to Kuh-i-Dasht plain . This section traverses 4 low ranges of hills: the first range Daghilleh-Sidann is pierced by the Tang Jangir, through which the alignment proposed passes: the second range Madian K.uh is skirted to the east and crossed at its lowest point about 4500. The third range &amp;. Astan-Kalkhani is similarly cir cumvented at about 5000*. The fourth range is pierced by the Tang Haleh and by the Madian Rud (4150* at the bridge): but it will probably be cheaper to take the line via Gulgul and pierce the fourth range by a tunnel ot ^ mile at the north end of the Kuh Dasht plain near Chashmeh Kamir: the height of the range here is 4700*: that of the spring about 4500 *. There is no use in my suggesting any particular alignment: several alternatives readily suggest themselves to any one on the spot. I estimate the distance that would have to be co vered by the line in order to reach the south edge of the huh- i-Dasht plain at 20 miles of which 10 miles easy at 75,000 a mile and 10 miles at 1-g- lakhs, as a good deal of blasting will be required. 44 • 8th Section. K.u h Dasht plain (4500*) to Kashgan (3650*) 55 miles . In this section we have to traverse or circumvent the Kuh- i-Guraz range, 6000* highjU It has a breadth of over 4 miles, and tunneling is scarcely practicable: it can however be cir cumvented to a large extent by skirting it eastward towards the Kashgan. xhis involves a rise to about 5800’ and thence a steady fall can be provided to the Kashgan, which would be crossed probably not far from the bridge at 3600 *• The anar chical conditions prevailing prevented me from examining the whole of the alignment but I am satisfied that it is practi cable • 10 miles 7,50,000 10 • 15, 00,000 Total for 7th Section 22,50,000 miles 20 Grand Total 183,15,000 ' 123 Distance&gt;u * 10 h it ;eri :ev rl ,h ed w-i Distance; difficult to estimate, as owing to haze I was able to triangulate satisfactorily.

The last 15 miles are along rocky slopes mainly of fairly stiff shale, but with a good deal of very hard limestone in places, and heavy cuttings through the smaller spurs. It should be possible to adopt a gradient not steeper than 1 in 75. 45• 9th Section. K ashgan (3650) to Khurramabad (4400) 27 miles . The alignment would follow the Kashgan R to its junction with the Ab-i-Khurramabad and then follow the general trend of the latter stream to tlie town. Various alternatives will doubtless suggest themselves when a proper survey is made, but the general alignment will remain the same. This section will present no difficulty: the last 10 miles would be H surface' line, were it not for the numerous small bridges and culverts that will have to be constructed and the slight embankment will be necessary to keep the slope even from terrace to terrace. The first 17 miles will be difficult to align, but should not be very expensive to construct, the hills being mainly of al luvium or shale with a little limestone.

I will now return to another alignment, up the gorge of ( the Kashgan river from its entrance to the Jaidar plain at Pul- i-Kurr o Duiihtar to its exit from the hhurramabad plain at Tang- i-Tir about 40 miles North. I had contemplated traversing this gorge or valley from end to end: unfortunately, however, owing to the unprecedented snow of this year, and a late season, the river was in full flood and quite unfordable. As the track up the valley crosses the river 30 or 40 times it was impossible for me to get up the gorge and I had to content myself by seeing what I could of it at intervals. ihe river winds amongst steep hills, generally ending in cliffs abutting on the bed: a big bend occurs about every two miles, when the river will be running on one bank or the other up against a cliff: it is then necessary to cross to the other bank which is usually a flat terrace: there is no clear view of the valley for more than three or four miles and at several points the cliffs on both sides run down to the water, leaving only a difficult mule track v/hich is covered when the river is in flood. At such points heavy rock cutting, revet ting, and tunneling will be necessary. The river must be cons tantly crossed, involving numerous bridges. 'The average breadtn of the river when not spread over the gravels, or divided into several branches, is about 200*: 300* would have to be provided as a rule, from abutment to abutment to provide for flood water. The river is liable to heavy floods, a rise of 15* being not unknown: the bed uniformly gravelly: no reefs or fallc as far as I know. The valley is narrow, but there is always'I always a fairly wide stretch of river terraces on one bank or the other. Difficult as the construction of a railway up such a valley would be, the alignment is a not unattractive one. It would be possible to have an almost even slope from the Saidmarreh to Khurramabad; and the ruling gradient would probably not exceed 1/100 at any point. Steel trestle bridges of stock size might be used to cross the stream and would, if I may presume to offer an opinion on such a technical point, be well suited to the country and conditions of labour and construction. 47. To estimate the cost of this gorge line, the length of which from Tang-i-Tir to Pul-i-Kurr o Dukhtar may be taken at 40 milos, is of course quite beyond me, even had I been able to traverse it from end to end. I am assured, however, on the authority of the Sardar Akram and others, the general accuracy of whose statements I have been able to check, that a mule track exists right up the gorge and that at no point does it contract to such an extent as to form an impassable canyon. Allowing 3 lakhs a mile for the line, including bridges, and 25 lakhs for special tunnelling (which would seem, all things considered, ggtfag to be a liberal allowance) for the northern and southern ends of this valley, which I have traver/sed, and the centre, which I have seen from a short distance, offer no formidable obstacles to railway construction, we obtain a to tal of 180 lakhs. The total cost of this alignment would thus be as follows Sections 1 to 5 miles 84 @ ^65,000 Kashgan gorge w 40 Tang-i-Tir-Khurramabad w 16 Grand Total 120 miles B 3 123,65,000 145,00,000 12 , 00,000 If 280, 65,000 £ 1,871,000 or £ 15,600 a mile. 48. The difference between the cost of this alignment and that via Madian Hud is £171,000 according to this estimate, which is a mere guess: the saving of length is no less than 65 miles. aboutabout on© quarter of the distance between Dizful and Burujirds the absence of steep gradients is an added advantage. Had I seen any chance of being able to examine this valley more closely, I would have waited for another month or two in order to do so, but the Sardar Axram, who alone could arrange for my safe conduct along this line, left for the Kermanshah district to revenge the murder of a friend of his, by plunder ing the guilty tribe and simultaneously hostilities commenced between the Bairawand and the Governor-General, making any fur- A ther stay in the neighbourhood out of the question. Ithink it not improbable that this alignment may turn out very little more, perhaps less, expensive than that via Kuh- i-Dasht and I would recommend that ay any engineer expert who may subsequently be deputed to prepare authoritative estimates and effect a regular and detailed survey of an alignment should first examine the Kashgan gorge: in order to do so, he must make his survey between June and November (the floods this year being quite abnormal) and must arrange with the Sardar Akram (whose headquarters are at Tarhan) to provide the necessary escort which he will, no doubt, gladly do. In any case the saving in length by this route may be considered to justify some extra expenditure.50 . ^ y~ olQ Pr-plonKation of line from iJiurrcimabad on//arde. The easiest prolongation would undoubtedly be towards her- man shall, distant rather more than 100 miles: the country tra versed is well fitted for a railway alignment which would run parallel to the mountain ranges which run in a b,d direction throughout euristan. But such prolongation would be of little use towards developing British trade in Central Persia, and I assume that the prolongation contempl ;ted is to Burujird find thence to Teheran via liamadan or via Bultanabad and Qum. Tne boundary between the Hussian sphere of influence and trie neutral son© in this region is 'a line starting from Qasr- i-uhirin, passing through Ispahan Herman shah and Buru- jird are thus included in the region in hich Great Britain en gaged not to seek concessions 'for railways, land, telegraphs, road, transport, insurance, etc*', though all concessions which existed in the region in question on ;*ugust 31st 1907 are main tained. The boundary line is roughly equidistant between mhurram- abad and Burijird. A prolongation by rail or motor beyond Khur- icumabad would presumably be possible only with the consent of ta.ic Russian dovernment who, it has been suggested, are likely eventually to vie?/ the project with hostility. Without such a prolongation at all events as far as Rurujird the utility of thejline would be greatly impaired and the volume of exports in particular would be of quite insignificant proportions. idiurramabad is a very bad distributing centre; the local market is negligible: the surrounding country disturbed: traffic on the main road to Burujird greatly impeded by snow in winter, and I feel convinced that any attempt to maiie the town into a railway terminus will be predoomed to failure, and trade will stick to the route via Baghdad, in which town are many whole sale dealers, from whom small buyers can order direct. The only practical alignment between Hhurramabad and Buru jird is that via dagheh, which X will now proceed to describe in detail.50 • ^ 0ction I * ^urramabad to foot of Zagheh Pass (6300*) 21 miles A steady climb along a stream which runs from the fo#t of the Zagheh pass all the way to ivhurramabad• ^ gradient of 1/50 is the best that can be obtained and it is possible that at one or two points 1/40 may be necessary for short distances. There is little heavy blasting but for the first ten miles there will be about three miles of blasting on the side of the hills, which are composed of limestone strata, covered in pla ces by alluvial gravels and clay. The passage of the Tang- i-Zaideh Ohir will involve some heavy cutting or embanking in order to reduce the gradient: so also will the ascent from the Tajareh to the Deh Tafid plain. The Darreh Daraz valley once entered the gradient becomes easier, end the line will be cheaper to construct: it would no doubt skirt the north side of the valley, rising steadily as far as is compatible with the maintenance of the ruling gradient. I estimate the cost at 1$ lakhs a mile = 31-|- lakhs, , Zagheh tunnel . The Zagheh pass (7200*) now confronts us: apart from the practical difficulty of carrying a railway up its steep rocky slopes and over its narrov/ crest, such a course would involve a long detour. There is no way of circumventing the range and I think there is no doubt but that it must be tun nelled: from 5600* on the S.W. to 6500* on the N• side is as nearly as 1 can judge 1^- miles through limestone rock: water is plentiful, I have no moans of estimating the cost with any approach to accuracy, but for the purposes of this report it may be put down at 50 lakhs. w* (6500*) 52. Section II, Across tne h/-dud v'lllay fro: • near Zagheh/to above iiang-i-Razan, (6800*) 15 miles . From Zagheh the alignment winds down the valley of the Zagheh stream till it can turn h.K. and skirt the B.side of the Rud valley, crossing the stream at about 6000*. It would then turn ft.W. and approach Rang-i-kazan village 6560*: then circlecircle round the village and skirt the elopes of ^uh Ohavireh Shah in a W*S#W. direction, rising steadily to about 6800* when the hill narrows sufficiently to make a tunnel, in all probability, economical. There is no break in the Ghavireh Shah range which the Zagheh-Razan road crosses at 7200* and the descent on the R. side to the Silakhor plain will be much more difficult from 7200* than from 6700*, the height at which I propose the R. exit of the tunnel should be fixed. I estimate this section to be 15 miles long costing lj lakhs a mile = 18-J lakhs. 53. Razan Tunnel . I estimate this to be 2000 yards long: formation lime stone rock: water plentiful. It might enter the hill on the south side at 6800* and emerge at 6700* in to the Razan valley. Cost may be put dov?n at 30 lakhs* I see no way of dispensing with it: the pass cannot be avoided, and if the railway be car ried over it to 7200* the drop of 1500* to the Silakhor valley will be prohibitively steep. 54. Section III. Razan (6700*) head of tunnel to Silakhor plain (5700 1 ) 10 miles . ' &lt;v if the mouth ofi the k/z&amp;n side be fixed at 6700 \ the drop will be 1000 1 : the actual distance between the mouth of the tunnel and the foot of the hills being less than 5 miles. The sides of the Razan valley are, on the whole, of a conformation favourable to the construction of a railway along them, but whether the east or west side of tiie valley should be selected is a point which can be settled after a careful survey« ny impression is that it v/ill be best to take the line into the azizabad valley and thence skirt the hills bounding the bilakhSr plain to the West, descending steadily on a gra dient of 1 in 50 till the plain is reached at approximately 5700 1 . This section will call for most careful surveys and a highhigh degree of engineering skill. Blasting will be necessary almost all the way: and numerous bridges across ravines will oe called for in addition to many culverts. I think three lakhs a mile would be fair estimate of cost, giving a total ) For this section of 30 lakhs. 55 * - IV * U P d ilakhor valley from near Uhulan Chalan to Burn- jird (5700 1 ) to(5900 1 ); 20 miles . It will probably be found convenient to follow the main road crossing the river near Ohulan Chalan and Keep to the eastern side of the valley. The river bed is about 100 yards wide: breadth of stream nominally 40 yards: depth in summer and autumn to feet: unfordable in spring; pebbly bot tom. Plain is fairly level and not irrigated from river, but by canals or Qanats from hill side: many villages scattered over the plain, nearly all (in 1911) deserted owing to the depredations of Lur tribesmen. There would be a certain amount of embanking and a lit tle cutting necessary if the line Keeps to the eastern side of the valley and it would be well to allow J lakhs a mile ior this section, in addition to which we must allow a lakh for the bridge. Total 16 lakhs. 56• Abstract, khurramabad to Burujird .

Ihe cost of this section per mile is thus very nearly double that of tile kjihamm^rah-idiurramabad section. I was prevented both by my in tractions and. by the fact that hostilities between the Oovernor-^eneral and the Baira- nwandMinerals. b'i I obtained information regarding several mines reported to exist near Burujird. Gold was said to be found in one mine, (a) and I was given a sample of the same, vhich I believe, however, o to be simply micaceous sand, ^ead ore was said to be found in remunerative quantities, 5 farsalchs distant, the ore yields (a) of metal; the sample I was snown seemed of very good qua lity. I was told at bihawand that a European mining expert had said that the hills of this town contained good grade copper ore, but X had no opportunity of confirming this. I was told of a place W. of Burujird, called Mial, here good quality coal-beds were exposed; the sample . iiown mo was bitu minous; it burnt well, but has, 1 saould say no commercial value• I was told that petroleum oil was found in the locality and had been collected and burnt in lamps* Geologically, the distinguishing feature of the country immediately M* and of Burujird is that the limestone for mation gives place to much contorted t'inely laminated shales, extensively mixed with veins of intrusive rocks; the formation would thus seem to be very favourable to the existence of metalliferous ores* At xJaurramabad I was shown specimen of bituminous coal from the Papi country &amp;* of that town, of iron pyrites from the same locality and of copper sulphate (zaq or zagh) but these minerals occur apparently in small quantities only on the surface and only the last named (which is used for dyeing) is worked at all. Agricultural produce . Cereals: mainly consumed locally, or exported to other parts of Persia* Opium, mainly consumed in Persia: some £30,000 exported. uums: ihfcied fruits. (Raisins etc.): steady export to Russia which v/ould be diverted to south by railway. Cotton : vi/ool . ditto. (a) .Deposited in the Bushire Residency., IU via Zaghoh and iiazan is always practicable for wheels, and ' little expense would be incurred except on the section bet ween Kazan and the Silakhor valley. Xhis route is about 220 miles long, and 1 have divided it into 15 stages: it is said to have been used in past times by Persian artillery: it was traversed by DeKode 1835 and Schindler 1889 and was undoubtedly a main artory of trade in bassanian times, witness the great bridge of Pul-i-ivurr o Dukh tar in the 'fang-i-i\hirsdarr • 1 am satisfied it is the shortest practicable cart-road. The experience of the road Company in S. Persia is, I believe, that it does not pay to carry merchandise in carts as a rule, pad animals being cheaper. It is possible therefore that a 183 miles pacx mule road from Dizful to mrujird in the xviya- lan would be of greater assistance to our trade than a 217 mile cart trad which involves greater expense and a larger staff along the road: but it may be hold also that under the concession the construction of a cart-road is obligatory, the phrase 'route chaussee' being used in the tide, though no where else according to the English translation in my posses sion. It should also be borne in mind that where ordinary carts might not pay, motor traffic would perhaps do so; the employ ment of a Renard train has recently been advocated on the OL sv Bjind^r Abbas - Kerman road for instance. Further, that the Transport Company has hitherto found itself quite unable to arrange for a sufficient supply of mules on the road in which they are interested: a mule-road unless well organised, would not serve the purpose of distri buting British goods into the present Russian zone, which is served by a well organised cart-road from xiasht to Ramadan.CONFIDENTIAL.

I reassured him on this point ■ and he then proceeded to impress on me the importance of our saying nothing either in LTehLZKhZkM line 7 7 pect ; n ! the idea ° f the Participation of British capital in iehran Khanikin line, for fear of its getting to Germany’s ears. After a few more l_looy aa —1Jremarks on the same subject, his Excellency, somewhat unexpectedly, said that he would o-ive me the vrimeur of the revised text of the draft agreement, although it had not yet been submitted either to the Council of Ministers or to the Emperor. He could not let me take a copy of it, as he wanted to be in the position to say to Germany, should thf*^ text ao-ain be divulged, that the only copies in existence were in the possession of the two Ministries for Foreign Alfairs. He would, however, allow me to read it. I thanked his Excellency for this proof of confidence, and I had subsequently the honour to forward to you a summary of its contents in my telegram No. 33 of the 11th instant. I called again on M. Sazonow on the 13th instant to convey to him your thanks and appreciation of the friendly communication which he had made to us. His Excellency expressed himself as much pleased with this message, but said that a tresh difficulty had arisen. The Council of Ministers had objected to the engagement which Russia was to take with regard to the construction of the Tehran-Khamkm line on the orouiid that the Russian public would denounce the Government for spending money on a railway which was to open the Persian markets to German trade before they had taken any steps to provide for the construction of a railway m the north which would render a similar service to Russian goods. He thought that a line from Enzeh to Tehran would suffice to tranquillise public opinion ; but unfortunately the Duma would never allow the Russian Government to give a guarantee for any railway m Persia while railways were so urgently needed m the interior of Russia He must therefore appeal to Paris and London for financial assistance, and he hoped t at the financiers who were interesting themselves m the Tehran-Khamkm line would be disposed to take up the northern line as well. The line from Enzeh to Tehran might eventually constitute the first section of the trans-Persian railway,^ and, apart from this prospective advantage, was likely to prove a more profitable investment than the Tehran-Khanikin line. While the two lines might be treated as one as far as the financial arrangements for their construction were concerned, complete secrecy must be observed with regard to the latter until after the publication of the Russo-German ^ I suggested that his Excellency might meet this new difficulty by announcing, simultaneously with the publication of the above-mentioned agreement, that the Russian Government were taking steps to obtain from the Persian Government a concession for a line from Enzeli to Tehran. The question of financing the line could I thought be left for future discussion. M. Sazonow replied that he could not ask tor the concession until he was sure of being able to find the necessary capital as it was most important that this line should be commenced as soon as possible, so as to forestall the line from Khanikin to Tehran. , . , T . „ nr a On the receipt of your telegram No. 49 of the 14th instant, I informed M. Sazonow that without a guarantee on the part of the Russian Government, it would be very difficult for us to induce British capital to participate in either of these railways; that we were ourselves considering the question of the construction of railways m Southern Persia for the promotion of our economic interests ; that we might eventually have to face the question of a guarantee; and that we could not compel British capital to do in Northern Persia what it would probably refuse to do in Southern Persia, viz., build railways without a Government guarantee. This communication seemed greatly to depress his Excellency. M. Pichon, he said, had taken a more hopeful and sym- oathetic view of the question, and he did not attempt to conceal his disappointment with our answer. He had, he said, promised to hand Count Pourtales the revised draft of the agreement by the end of the week, and, m view of what I had told him, he did not see how he could now prevent the Tehran-Khanikin line passing into the hands i of Germany. I said that he could do this by adhering to the formula which he had inserted in his new draft, and by obtaining, at the same time, a concession lor ^ e Enzeli-Tehran line, or by reverting to the formula that I had originally suggested to him under which Russia would reserve the right of inviting the participation ot foreign oanital It was quite unnecessary to hand over the railway to Germany straight ott. It would be time enough to do so if, in a few years’ time, he found it impossible to raise the necessary capital either at home or m Paris and London. He should remember moreover, that Russia’s refusal either to give a Government guarantee or to subscribe her quota of the capital might entail the renunciation of her po icy of railway construct on in Persia and the consequent loss of her influence and prestige M. Sazonow replied that this might be the case, but he feared that the Council of Ministers would not sanction 8 either of the alternatives of which I had spoken They would he sa,d&gt; « stoned ” were they to contribute to an undertaking which would open the dooi o German goods in the south and leave it shut to Russian trade in the north. They&lt;3ould not, on the other hand, he reproached should the Tehran-Khanikin line be constructed in spite of their keeping entirely aloof from it. His Excellency, however, promised that he would do nothing till I saw him again after the arrival of the ^messenger in three days’ time. At the close of our conversation M. Sazonow observed that it was most important, both in the interests of Russia and of Europe, that an agreement should be arrived at between Russia and Germany. Sir Arthur Nicolson had given Count Benckendorff to understand that Turkey was about to approach us on the subject of the Bagdad Railway. She would certainly not take such a step without first assuring herself that it was approved at Berlin, and he thought that this more friendly disposition on the part of the German and Turkish Governments was the indirect result of the Potsdam interview. His Excellency evinced considerable curiosity with regard to the lines on which the approaching negotiations were to be conducted, and concluded by saying that if we were going to get all we wanted with regard to the Gulf section he could not understand why we were now taking up the question of railways in South Persia. I replied that His Majesty’s Government were as anxious as his Excellency that the present negotiations should be brought to a, satisfactory conclusion, but that, as regarded his last remark, it was by no means certain that we should obtain what we wanted relative to the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway. When I saw M. Sazonow on the 18th instant after the receipt of your telegram No. 55 of the preceding day, 1 was agreeably surprised to find that his Excellency had overcome the opposition of his colleagues to the wording of article 2, which deals with the Tehran—Khanikin Railway, by inserting a few lines at the commencement calcu lated to allay any apprehensions that might be felt here with regard to the northern railway. M. Sazonow allowed me to read once more the revised text of the agreement in what he gave me to understand would be its final form. It now consists of a preamble and four articles. The preamble records the principle of commercial equality, recognises Russia’s special political interests in Persia, and ascribes a purely commercial character to the interests of Germany. Article 1 is a revised reproduction of the 4th article of the original draft, and the only important difference that I was able to detect was the omission of all reference to concessions of a territorial character. Article 2 reads, as far as I can remember, as follows :— “ The Russian Government, having the intention of securing from the Government of the Shah the concession for the construction of a system of railways in the north, engages to obtain simultaneously a concession for a linking-up line for the Sadijeh- Khanikin Railway (without Tehran being specified as the junction), when that branch of the Konieh-Bagdad Railway shall have been completed.” Article 3 states that Russia will place no obstacles in the way of “ cette entreprise,” though she cannot be required to make any financial sacrifices. In the text which M. Sazonow showed me on the 10th instant the Konieh-Bagdad Railway was, if I am not mistaken, referred to as “the above-mentioned railway”—or words to that effect instead of “ cette entreprise.” The article concludes with a revised version of the former 3rd article respecting the railways to the north of Khanikin, Germany engaging not to lend her material or diplomatic support to any such enterprise without a previous understanding with the Russian Government. Article 4 is to the following effect:— “ Should the Russian Government waive, in favour of other concessionnaires, its rights with regard to the linking-up line provided for in article 2, all the other stipulations of the present agreement shall remain in force.” The object of the above article is to guard against the danger of Germany repudiating her obligations under the agreement in the event of Russia ceding her rights with regard^ to the^ Tehran-Khanikin line to any third parties. M. Sazonow told me that he did not intend to say anything to Count Pourtales respecting the possible^ participation of French and British capital. The formula which he was now submitting would give him a perfectly free hand, and enable him to make what financial arrangements he liked when the time came. It was probable, he thought, that Germany would^ insist on -inserting in the 2nd article, after the words “ engages to obtain simultaneously a concession for,” the words “ and to proceed I to^ the construction of,” but this was a small matter to which he would raise no ; objection. *In the course of our conversation his Excellency reverted once more to the question of our railways in South Persia, and enquired whether we had any particular lines in view. I told him that, though I expected shortly to receive a communication on-this subject, I could give him no information, as nothing whatever had been decided at present. He would perhaps remember having spoken to me strongly a few weekf^ ago in favour of our constructing a line from Mohammerah to Khanikin. So far as I had been able to ascertain no such project had ever been put forward, but I believed that a line from Mohammerah to Khuramabad had been spoken of, and I presumed that this project would find equal favour with his Excellency. M. Sazonow replied that he had spoken as he had done in favour of a Mohammerah-Khanikin railway because he believed that such a line would strike a death-blow to the prolongation of the Bagdad Railway to the Gulf. The Council of Ministers, to whom he had communicated what he had heard on the subject, had approved the project on the same grounds. The Ministers of Finance and Commerce had, however, remarked that two such parallel railways would be de trop, and he very much doubted whether they would approve of a railway running due north from Mohammerah to the Russian sphere. He would have thought it would be more in our interests to construct railways further south, and he did not see what great advantages we would derive from such a line, as it would run for a considerable distance along the banks of the Karun. On my calling on his Excellency this afternoon, M. {Sazonow informed me that he had just handed to the German Ambassador the revised draft of the Russo-German agreement which he had shown me on Saturday. He had, he said, endeavoured to impress on Count Pourtales that he had gone as far as he could to meet the wishes of his Government, and had expressed the hope that the German Government would accept the agreement as it stood and would confine itself to proposing purely verbal alterations. Count Pourtales had reciprocated this wish and had personally raised no objections to the text. In the course of our further conversations M. Sazonow once more referred to the subject of our approaching negotiations with Turkey. He had, he said, questioned the German Ambassador on the subject, but his Excellency had professed entire ignorance. I told him that all that I knew was that we had informed the Turkish Ambassador in London that our ears were open to anything that the Turkish Government might wish to say to us on the subject of the Bagdad Railway, and that, so far as I was aware, no definite proposals had as yet been submitted to us. I think, however, that it would be advisable to satisfy his Excellency’s curiosity, so far as we could do so, and to allay any apprehensions which he may entertain on the subject by promising to keep him informed as to the course of these negotiations. I see from Sir F. Bertie’s telegram No. 11 of the 17th instant that M. Pichon has given M. Isvolsky such an assurance, and I fear that if we fail to do the same M. Sazonow may think that we are wanting in confidence towards him. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN.DRAFT TELEGRAM. 30o SECRETARY OF STATE TO VICEROY, FOREIGN DEPARTMENT.

It would provide a direct route to the district of which Hamadan is the distributing centre. Forty per cent, of British imports into Persia are distributed from Hamadam These now pass via Bagdad, and, in view of project of linking up Bagdad Railway with Hamadan, construction of Mohammerah line would seem to be essen tial to the survival of this British market, unless we can count upon British control of the Gulf section of Bagdad Railway and can prevent British seaborne trade via Bagdad being penalised out of the field. Could we be sure on this point Mohammerah line would lose much of its importance for our commerce, but even in this case it would still, 1 believe, afford the cheapest access for our goods to the important markets of the Hamadan district, and it would not seem desirable to leave this most important corner of South-West Persia open to the enterprise of third Powers. Usefulness of the line would of course be greatly increased if Russia links up her railway system in the north with Khoremabad and allows our goods fair play. This would, however, he so disadvantageous for her that it is not a likely prospect, but even so, should Russia begin constructing south from Julia, we should be in a better position for the defence of our trade against Russian commercial invasion with the Mohammerah- Khoremabad line than without it. Should His Majesty’s Government for any reason decide not to proceed with this line for the present, His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire thinks that we should fall back on a line from Mohammerah or Ahwaz (via Khor Musa) to Shiraz and Bunder Abbas, with a branch to Bushirg. Line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, being in our sphere, is of course not so &gt; A urgent. Moreover, please see my despatch No. 232 regarding Mr. Preece’s negotiations.

I concur in course outlined in first three paragraphs, but I should like to postpone moving tor a time. I nave good reason to think Regent wonld he embarrassed by His Majesty s Government broaching the question of railways at this moment, and I would prefer to wait a week or two m the hope that by then his Highness will be firmlv seated m office. _ Moreover, Regent is exerting himself to allay feeling in the country against Great Britain and Russia, and the atmosphere may shortly be more favourable for treating the question of railways. After consultation with His Majesty’s consul at Bushire I would recommend that when the time comes for applying for Mohammerah-Khorremabad concession application should be made to Persian Government, and that we should inform sheikh as soon as we applied, as the alternative course would, I fear, give umbrage to Persian Government. ' &amp; I agree to utilising the services of Wilson now for the survey of sections outside Russian sphere. His Majesty’s consul-general reports that conditions are more promising than he anticipated when he wrote his despatch of the 2nd October to India. This may not be lasting, and if Wilson is to go he should receive authority to start without delay. As regards risk attendant on Wilson’s journey, I see no likelihood of there beino- less danger at some later time. &amp; Wilson will be in a position to judge whether it will be advisable to persevere alter he has stayed awhile at Dizful, but the delay which has occurred will make it impossible for him to obtain final sanction contemplated in paragraph 5 of Cox’s above-mentioned despatch, and he will have to use his discretion.

Confidential.) p&lt;yreign 0fice&gt; Feb 14 19n IN Mew of lecent events and of the rumours of a large railway loan I have been considering the question of railway construction in Pefsia and the best means of safeguarding British interests. It would appear to me advisable in the first instance to recall to the recollection of the Persian Government the rescript addressed bv the Shah to his Minister for Foreign Affairs dated 16th September, 1888, giving priority to the British Government over others m the construction of southern railroads and a positive assurance that no southern railway would be granted to a foreign country without consultation with the British Government. S y • JY 8 ' n 1 '| e 5 takin ? “ a y hav e escaped the notice of the present Ministers, and it might be well to remind them of its existence, and to say that His Majesty s Govern ment assume, as a matter of course, that it will be observed; it is of course still binding, notwithstanding change of regime ; in this connection the analogy of Bagdad Railway concession would apply. I desire, however, to have your views, and those of the Government of India, before making any communication to the Persian Government r , A ^ 1SCA1SS10 ^ 0± the whole subject must depend to some extent upon the disposition of the Persian Government. If they accepted such a communication in a reasonable spmt we would then add that His Majesty’s Government would be willing to confer with them upon the question of railway construction in the south whenever they are ready, and that they are animated in the matter as much by their solicitude for the tue security and development of Persia as by a desire for the expansion of British commerce. Until there are railways in the south the central Government cannot hope to establish its authority, and the safety of transit, which would greatly benefit our commerce, would be of equal advantage to the economic welfare of Persia. The two lines to which we attach the most importance are :— 1. That from Mohammerah northwards to Khumetabad with a branch to Khor Musa (where a port would be constructed); and 2. A line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman. Others in order of merit are the following :— 3. A line from Bushire via Aliabad to some point 4. A line from Bunder Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz. Opinion agrees as to the commercial advantage of the Mohammerah line, and no opposition need be anticipated from Russia, as M. Sazonow has himself suggested to Sir G. Buchanan our applying at once for the concession. There is some difficulty, however, in determining how to proceed. Should appli cation for a concession be made to the sheikh, and the concurrence of the Persian Government afterwards obtained, or should we, in the first instance, approach the Persian Government ? I should like your views on this point. M e have not considered any scheme in detail, but I do not anticipate any great difficulty in obtaining money in the City for construction. The railway would obviously be nominally Persian, but would have to be more or less under British management. It might be mortgaged to the syndicate who lend the money, and the Persian Government might receive a percentage of shares as purchase-money for the concession. In view of these considerations it would perhaps be as well to utilise the services of Mr. Wilson for the survey of the section Dizful-Burujird (excluding that portion within the Russian sphere), but, before instructing him, we should be glad to know whether he could undertake the work without the previous consent of the Persian Government, and whether it would be safe for him to do so in the present condition of the country. The effect on the position of the Regent of approaching the Persian Government in regard to this question must be borne in mind. [151—1921i.Ir. Hirtzel, Mr. Parker and myself have con eidered -one question of the construction of Railways in Southern Persia (neutral and southern zone) and have come to the conclusion that the Lines which it is important should not pass under foreign control are tlie following: A line froi/i Khor Musa on Hie Persian Gulf^ of a port at Klior I/fusa. 2.

Sazonow during the LiboZ qq —21 J m -— - -j o / | COPY TO Hi DO ! SRCHETARV 1 !2 past fortnight, and that his Excellency is very prone to shift his ground. ? While he has consistently treated the danger to which you called Count BenckendorfFs attention as a purely imaginary one, he has not been equally consistent in the arguments to which he has had recourse in order to disprove its existence. More than once he has contended that neither the Sadijeh-Khanikin nor the Khanikin-Tehran Railways wilT ever exist except on paper, and that all that the German Government is aiming at is to obtain some assurance from Russia which will satisfy public opinion at home that everything is being done to safeguard Germany s economic interests in Persia. On one occasfon, however, he adopted an entirely different line of argument. Russia, he said, was close by in the Caucasus, and we therefore had nothing to fear, as on the first indication of such a danger she would at once send her troops to Tehran. This remark is very characteristic of the light-hearted manner in which his Excellency regards the very serious consequences which the engagements that he is now about to take may eventually entail. It was in much the same spirit that he recently said to me that we could always oppose the construction of the final section of the Bagdad Railway by sending ironclads to the Gulf. In the conversation which I reported in my telegram No. 19, Secret, of the 24th instant, I endeavoured once more to impress on him the importance of keeping the absolute control of the Khanikin-Tehran Railway in the hands of Russia. Were the Indian Government, I said, to learn that German} 7- was to acquire the right to construct and control that line, they would be far less likely to take a favourable view of the trans- Persian railway scheme. It was, moreover, surely not to the interests of Russia to give Germany a footing in North Persia which might undermine Russia’s influence at Tehran and occasion serious friction between the two Empires. His Majesty’s Government, I added, would be only too glad were the negotiations now proceeding to result in an arrangement satisfactory to Russia, but I ventured to doubt whether such a result would be obtained by a too ready compliance with all of Germany’s demands. M. Sazonow did not attempt to rebut these arguments, and acquiesced entirely in my last remark. He had, he said, informed the German Ambassador on the previous day that, while ready to consider an amended text of article 3, he could not entertain any proposal that would in any way weaken the material effect of that article. It is satisfactory to know that on this point, at any rate, M. Sazonow proposes to take a firm stand, and it is not improbable that pressure is being brought to bear on him by the military authorities, who will, as he tells me, have to examine the railway question from the strategic point of view. As regards the question of the control of the Khanikin-Tehran line, I fear that his Excellency is far from sound, though the last thing which he said to me on the subject was that it might be possible to arrange that Russia should participate to the extent of 60 per cent, in its construction, and thus retain the predominant control. From the assurances which M. Sazonow has given me there can, 1 think, be no doubt that his Excellency has not in any way committed himself in the question of the 4 per cent, increase of the Turkish customs dues. He has always told me that the statement made in article 1 of the draft agreement that no pecuniary sacrifice was to be required from Russia was specially inserted in order to leave her a perfectly free hand with regard to this question. He has also informed me that he had explained at Potsdam that, as this was a question which concerned Russia’s general foreign policy, it could not form one of the subjects of discussion between the two Governments. He has more than once tried to argue, in defence of the engagement which he has taken not to oppose the realisation of the Bagdad Railway, that neither England, Russia, nor France has ever directly opposed that scheme, and that they have only offered it a negative opposition by declining to give it their financial support. As the proposed increase in the customs dues cannot be enforced without their consent, they still possess, as he believes, a very effective weapon for opposing the completion of the railway to the Gulf. He mentioned to me the other day that he had heard that there was an English project for a railway from Mohammerah to Khanikin, and he strongly advised us to give it our support It could, he believed, be built entirely on Persian territory, and its construction might prove fatal to the continuation of the Bagdad Railway beyond that town. I said that I had never heard of the projected railway, but that I rather doubted whether, if it were constructed, the Germans would ever renounce the idea of bringing the Bagdad Railway down to the Gulf.

It may be necessary, in connection with conditions of joint advance of 400,000L, that some programme of railway concessions to be ear-marked to this country should be formulated. Have you any observation on the proposals which have been suggested ?— 1. The southern section of line from Julfa to Mohammerah, of which Eussia will applv for northern section ; 2. Kerman to Bunder Abbas ; 3. Ahwaz to Bunder Abbas via Shiraz with the option of a port at Khor Musa ; 4. Line between some point on No. 3 and Bushire vi&amp; Aliabad ; 5. Eobat to Kerman ; 6. Guattar or Charbar to Kerman. There is, it will be understood, no probability of construction in near future of any of these’ lines, and application of Indian revenues to their construction would not have my consent. But possibility oi concession, which might threaten political or strategical interests of India, being obtained by third Power must be guarded against. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Government of India to Viscount Morley. (Telegraphic.) P. _ . Mai/3, 1910. YOKE telegram dated the 11th April as to railway concessions in Persia. Securing of British position at the head of the Persian Gulf is of greatest strategical importance. The first step, consequently, is to get converted into a definite concession the option held by us for the southern section of the line from Julfa to Mohammerah up to the southern limit of the Eussian sphere. Next step, in order to preclude possible German enterprise, would be to obtain a concession or option for a specified line, through the neutral zone, from a port on the Persian Gulf to the plateau, We recommend Nos. 3 and 4 of your telegram for this purpose. By this means our position on the eastern littoral of the Gulf would be consolidated and our influence throughout Southern and Central Persia increased. All options or concessions within British sphere, i.e., Bunder Abbas-Kerman-Eobat, Kerman-Charbar or Guattar, come last in importance; these should be secured, not necessarily for construction, but merely to prevent outside interference in our sphere. If it is only contemplated to secure blocking options, then an option for the Bunder Abbas-Kerman line is of less immediate importance on political grounds than an option for your Nos. 3 and 4 as one concession. On the other hand, if any British syndicate should be ready to take up the project of a line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, which is undoubtedly feasible, at once, Lien political importance of obtaining mere blocking option for Bunder Abbas-Shiraz- Bushire scheme, of which we are not assured as to engineering feasibility, would be outweighed by the acquisition of a definite concession for the former project. As long a period as possible should be fixed for all concessions. (Eepeated to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, and Eesident, Bushire.)ho y (418^/10).

As Lieutenant Wilson points out in the concluding paragraph of his letter, he would probably be back in India within a year of his appointment as a probationer, and this period will also have elapsed in Lieutenant Bankings case. 5. The importance of the piece of work in question is undoubted, and I am mclmed to support the proposal on certain conditions, because the work is so important and because the officer making the proposal is so specially well qualified to carry it through, and both his status at the time and the juncture so convenient for the purnose m hand ' 1 r . ^ the same time the project cannot be lightly undertaken. It is very necessary to impose the condition that Lieutenant Wilson should spend some time in Dizful, cultivating and making interest with persons able to help him, and that he should not take the field with the tribes in the early spring unless he has been able to make sufficient headway to satisfy us that reasonable grounds now exist for believing that he can proceed without undue risk. f2968 r—2] y /, ■ y JO !

Haworth, LA., &gt;n or about the 1st January, 1911, and then proceed to the examination of the Bushire- lahrum country, which should be completed by some date in April, 1911. . 2. On completion of this duty I should in the ordinary course apply for pnvilege- eave home, as I shall then have served more than three years continuously m Persia, mrl anxious, if possible, to have a few weeks in England before taking up fresh 3 . I gee, however, from correspondence regarding railways m Persia, which you have been good enough to show me in connection with the Bushire-Jahrum enquiry, that the whole question of the Mohammerah-Julfa Railway is under lively consideration, and that one of the principal objections of His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India against active measures in this connection, is that it has not yet been ascertained whether the proposed Mohammerah-Julfa line is practical from the engineering point of view It is pointed out that not only have no surveys been made, but there has not been even such an examination of the country through which the line would run as to enable even the roughest forecast to be made either of the cost or of the bes Mignmen^ Q ffice memoran( j um 0 f the 29th September records as among the principal drawbacks the absence of all surveys, even of a preliminary character, of the alignment of the proposed railway, and the uncertainty as to the results o tie oi company’s operations in South-West Persia. _ . , The absence of all survevs is again referred to in the Foreign Office memorandum to M. Isvolsky on the 14th October. in no u u 5. Sir George Barclay, in his despatch No. 289 of the 4th November, 1908, dealt with the question of investigating the Dizful-Khuremabad country, and seemed o consider that the commencement of enquiry into the practicability or otherwise of the JDizful-Burujird Railway was a matter of urgency. The absence of all data in regard to the southern section of the railway is again referred to in Foreign Office despatch of the 19th January, 1910, to the India Office. 6. I see also from the correspondence forwarded to you under Foreign Depaitmen letter of the 30th August, 1910, that Sir George Mackenzie is anxious to arrange an amalgamation of British interests in South-West Persia with a view to pushing actively the Luristan road. It appears that the Imperial Bank of Persia are ready to par icipa e in the scheme, and that hopes are entertained that, under more vigorous management, better use may be made of the road concessions of the Persian Transport Compan) t an can be hoped for under present conditions. _ . . . ^ , 7. It is difficult therefore to resist the conclusion that the investigation o Dizful-Burujird section is a matter of immediate practical importance, and I ~g ^ suggest that I be permitted to undertake it at once, either as soon as 1 have an e over to Captain Haworth, or after I have examined the Bushire-Jahrum country. In view of the greater urgency of the Luristan project, I venture to suggt'S ^ former alternative, the Bushire-Jahrum enquiry being postponed to some subsequen date. The spring is the best season to commence negotiations for the penetra ion Luristan, as the tribes are, during January and February, in theiiy winter quayers, an during March commence their migration to the hills. This is the time when i is eas ..4 Political Department. But 1 would respectfully point out that even if the above proposal be sanctioned, I should hope to be m India w.thm » of the date on wh,ch I was appointed to the department as a probationer (1st June, 1910), which is approximately the same period as that for which Lieutenant Banking will have been the department without having passed his exammaLon when he reaches India.

I am anxious to place the material before Government simultaneously with the subject of my more urgent letter of to-day’s date, and therefore submit it without commenting at length on details of its contents, which, however, seem to me to he generally accurate and well considered. I would only remark now, lest I be held to endorse it, that I am inclined to disagree with the writer’s view as to what is probably the best site for a terminus at Jyloliammerah. It is true that the site recommended by lieutenant Wilson is opposite the ordinary anchorage of steamers, but it is on the Shatt-el-Arab, and in view of the delicacy of the question of jurisdiction on that river, and on grounds of strategic security, it seems a matter for consideration whether a site on the Karun just above Mohammerah would not be more desirable, with a light railway, if necessary, alone the bank to the custom-house. 1 am forwarding a copy of this communication to His Maiesty’s Minister I have, &amp;c. .

Local Traffic. It is not possible at this stage to give any reasoned estimate of the quantity of goods that would be carried by rail were the connection of Mohammerah with bultanabad and Central Persia generally complete either by rail or road. But m regard to ocal traffic alone, it is possible to obtain some idea of the volume of produce which would be imported to be exported from Dizful by railway. The imports into Diz u from Mohammerah or Amarah are not large, probably not more than 1,000 tons per annum. The exports are at the moment even smaller, owing to lack of communications, the existence of a railway would afford a stimulus to agriculture, and the exports of gram reeds for pens, oil seeds, cotton, wool, gum, galls, &amp;c , would rapidly increase and might reach a total of 10,000 tons by the end of the third year. , It is improbable that the railway, even were it to touch the Xarun opposite Ahwaz, would be able to secure an appreciable proportion of the imports and exports which are now transported by steamer between Ahwaz and Mohammerah, and between Ahwaz and Ispahan bv mules. The river steamers wall always be m a position, as long as the river is not utilised for irrigation, to compete successfully against the railway. Relation of Railway to Irrigation Schemes in Arabistan. From the foregoing paragraphs it is plain that the Mohammerah—Dizful Railway would have to rely for its traffic mainly on the through traffic between Central lersia and the south, local requirements being almost negligible at the present moment. But it must not be imagined that the low productivity of the country through which the railway passes is necessarily permanent. It is due to lack of security, capital, or communications. The construction of the railway will bring security, and a wise and moderate capital outlay on irrigation wmrks at Ivut Kahr Hashnn and DiMu by those responsible for the railway wall not only be financially profitable m itself, but will greatly increase traffic receipts. Any detailed reference to the Karkhah irrigation scheme would be out oi place here, and reference is invited to Sir W. Willeocks’s detailed reports on the subject. It is sufficient to say that he estimated that by a dam at Sinn-ul-Abbas, 5 miles above Kut Nahr Hashim, an area of 100,000 acres could be irrigated by a capital expenditure of 15,0001., upon which a return of 20 per cent, was certain. The existence of a railway from Mohammerah to Kut Nahr Hashim would probably reduce the expenditure necessary from 75,0001’. to 50,000k _ ] But this scheme does not stand alone ; millions of acres of potentially fertile land, on the west bank of the Diz and on either side of the Shaur now lie fallow, and only await irrigation to give proof of a richness and productivity unequalled even m Mesopotamia. # A.

Wilson, Acting Consul, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1 have the honour to remind you that under present arrangements I shall hand over charge of His Majesty’s Consulate for Arabistan to Captain L. B.2 Haworth, I.A., on or about the ist January ign, a™*.then proceed to the examination of the Bushire-Jahrum country, which should be completed by some date in April 1911 . 2 On completion of this duty I should in the ordinary course apply for privilege leave home, as 1 shall then have served more than three years continu ously in Persia, and am anxious if possible to have a few weeks in England before taking up fresh duties. 2 1 see however, from correspondence regarding railways in Persia which vou have been good enough to show me in connection with the Bushire-Jahrum enqtdry that th' whole question of the Mohammerah-Julfa Railway is under lively consideration, and that one of the principal objections of His Majesty s Secretary of State for India against active measures in this connection is that it has not yet been ascertained whether the proposed Mohammerah-Julfa line is practical from the engineering point of view. It is pointed out that not only have no surveys been made, but there has not been even such an examination M the country through which the line would run as to enable even the roughest forecast to be made either of the cost or of the best alignment. a. A Foreign Office memorandum of 29 th September records, as among the principal drawbacks, the absence of all surveys, even of a preliminary character of the alignment of the proposed railway, and the uncertainty as to the results of the Oil Company’s operations in Soutn-West Persia. The absence of all surveys is again referred to in the Foreign Office memo randum to M. Isvolsky on 14 th October. c Sir George Barclay in his despatch No. 289 of 4 th November 1908 dealt with the question of investigating the Dizful-Khurramabad country, and seemed to consider that the commencement of enquiry into the practicability or otherwise of the Dizful-Burujird Railway was a matter of urgency. The absence of all data in regard to the southern section of the railway is again referred to in Foreign Office despatch No. 46,604 of 19 th January 1910 to the India Office. 6 I se^ also from the correspondence forwarded to you under Foreign Department'letter No. 1859 -E.A. of r ,oth August ^ 1910 that Sir George Mackenzie is anxious to arrange an amalgamation of British interests in South- West Persia with a view to pushing actively the Lunstan road. It appears that the Imperial Bank of Persia are ready to participate in the scheme, and that hopes are entertained that under more vigorous management better use may be made of the road concessions of the Persian Transport Company than can be hoped for under present conditions. 7 . It is difficult therefore to resist the conclusion that the investigation of the Dizful-Burujird section is a matter of immediate practical importance, and I beg to suggest that I be permitted to undertake it at once, either as soon as x 1 1 1 HcmmrhVt nr aftpr 1 havft examined the Bushire* Jahrum country. In view of the greater urgency of the Luristan project, I venture to suggest the former alternative, the Bushire-Jahrum enquiry being postponed to some sub sequent date. The spring is the best season to commence negotiations tor the penetration of Luristan, as the tribes are during January and ^ ebr ^ ar y winter quarters and during March commence their migration to the hills ; this is the time when it is easiest to travel northwards and to get into touch with the various tribes who control the several alternative routes. 8 . I have travelled extensively in Lur country and have some acquaintance with the dialect, manners and customs of the Lur tribes. I have Persian acquaint ances in Dizful who could facilitate mv enquiry, were I to commence from Uiztui, by giving me introductions to Lur chiefs. Were I to commence at Buruprd, our native agent there could render similar services. 9 . I do not conceal, however, from myself that the task which I am suggest ing for myself is one of some difficulty. The country has been unvisited tor b3 cTl cm el' Douglas ^and f C a'p ui n n L o H m e r [® petltl0n of , , th ® outrage committed on But I submit that an independent officer nn?°f W ?a d h?

Such information as I have been aide f„uf„• • . _ . makes me believe that no more propitious occasion thin the' r t0 Lun u stan enquiry has offered itself for some years. But whether th^ ^ SUCh 30 I am convinced that no better opportunitv is likelv tn he h » th k c . ase J or n , ot » p re? „ i„ Persia aa/.E'.^ H,' « ?,' td 1 ™? d',t' a ’ I : . Wei ? 1 P ermIt ted to undertake this duty, my efforts would be directed to ascertaining by personal examination of the whol^ country and of all the princi- pal routes, ^ch route or routes is most promising for a railway. My report would be sufficiently detailed to enable an expert to form some esdmate of cost t th ‘ S c f )nnectl °n 1 take the liberty to mention that I have had, whilst in mili- ary employ careful trainmg and some experience i n t hi s branch of engineering I should at the same time investigate the political conditions now obfaining fn Lunstan, ascertaining what^ tribes were predominant, and with what chiefs or other principal personages it might be expedient to make agreements to ensure the uninterrupted progress of the work of construction. It is now 4 years since Captain Lorimer reported on ,the subject, during diangeT 6 thG kaleidosco P iC condl tions of Luristan must have considerably In regard to the road project I should make similar enquiries and should hope to be able in 6 months time to put Government in possession of a report dealing with all important local factors on which definite, and at all events in the case ot the road prompt, action could be taken. 12 , The unsettled condition of the country and the fact that the success or otherwise of the enquiry would depend in no small degree upon fortuitous circum stances makes it almost impossible to estimate with any accuracy the duration and cost of such an investigation as I have proposed. But, having regard to the movements of the tribes, and the climatic factor, I am of the opinion that a less period than 6 months would be insufficient for such an enquiry, as delay in starting and the impossibility of choosing one’s own time and route are factors to be reckoned with. 13 . As regards cost, it must be remembered that in Luristan foreigners have little prestige, the Persian Government none, and that a traveller has in consequence t;o submit, not infrequently, to extortion on a scale uncommon else where in Persia. I should of course exercise due economy, but a liberal provi sion for unforeseen contingencies is necessary, and I therefore estimate the prob able monthly cost as follows :— r Rs. a. Pay • • • ... 753 12 Transport ... ... 300 0 Presents, guards, watchmen, rents,.. ... ... 446 4 Total • • • ... 1,500 0 With ordinary luck I should hope to effect considerable economy on those figures, but I have thought it better to leave a reasonable margin for contingen cies in order that it may not be necessary to trouble Government with supplemen tary applications for sanction. 14 . lam fully aware or the necessity, both in the interests of Government and of myself, that I should return to India in due course to pass my examina-4 tions for the Political Department. But 1 would respectfully point out that, even if the above proposal be sanctioned, I should hope to be in India within a year of the date on which I was appointed to the Department as a probationer (ist June 1910 ), which is approximately the same period as that for which Lieutenant Ranking will have been in the Department without having passed his examina tion when he reaches India.

One leaves Ahwaz to the east, and instead touches Kut Nahr Hashim, a potential irrigation centre of the greatest importance. The second follows the west bank of the Karun to Aminiyeh opposite Nasiri (Ahwaz) and runs thence direct to Dizful. The comparative merits of the two routes are summarised below:— Kut Nahr Hashim route. Aminiyeh route. Length 164 miles Length 174 miles.

The Nizam-es-Sultaneh might be ignored and left to put in his claim for compensation in respect of the uncultivated lands or the lands intermit- i.^ U ^ Va * :ed have been appropriated for the use of the railway and which he might claim as his own. 1Possible tribal opposition outside Shaikh's territories. —I think it impro- bab’e that any serious opposition to the construction of the line, or any serious attempt to interfere with it when constructed, would be experienced. A hundred armed men supplied by the Shaikh would be ample to protect the camps from occasional raiding parties of trans-Frontier Arabs, and if the services of half a regiment of Pioneers from India were to be utilised, their double r 6 le of workmen and soldiers would stand them in good stead and pro bably greatly facilitate rapid construction. Moreover, their position and duties as Pioneers would conceal to a large extent their military role and enable their services to be utilised without causing great alarm to the Persian Government. The presence of Lur tribes, mainly Sagwand, in the neighbourhood of Shush and Dizful might cause some sFght difficulty, but these tribes take readily to manual labour and the advent of the railway, with the consequent demand for unskilled labour, would be welcome to them. In any case, the support of their headmen could he obtained without great expense. Technical. Description of the country through ’which the line would pass. Moham- merah-Kut Nahr Hashim section. 86 miles. —Flat barren alluvial soil not liable to be flooded except close to Mohammerah, and then only a few inches deep. Little sand. No stone. Practically no nalas or drainage channels. No vegeta tion. Water obtainable anywhere at from 15 ' to 20 ' by digging. Kut Nahr Hashim is 250 ' above sea. Kut Nahr Hashim-Shaur. 16 miles. —Gently undulating ground, low short ridges of soft rock which can be cut through or skirted. Sandhills frequent but offer no difficulty to railway construction. Upward slope of ground towards the north still almost imperceptible. No drainage channels or nalas worthy of note. Shaur River must be bridged (see below). Cultivation in good years near Kut Nahr Hashim. Shaur-Shush. 45 miles. —Up to within 10 miles of Shush, line follows west bank of Diz. Alluvial soil. No sand or stones. Plentiful brushwood. At io miles south of Shush, low gravel hills perhaps 6 o' high have to be crossed. These offer no difficulty whatever and will form a useful source of gravel for ballast. From the foot of the hills to Shush the ground is flat and alluvial, culti vated (by rain) here and there and by irrigation near Shush. Shush is about 550 ' above the sea. Shush-Dizful. —Over undulating and, near Dizful, stony ground. Two branches of the Balad Rud crossed (see below). No difficulty whatever offered to railway. Rail-head would be on west bank of Diz close to bridge; the Qal’echd-Kushk on the west bank of the town might well be utilised in connection with the railway. Dizful is 600 ' above sea. Gauge. —The gauge of Russian railways in the Caucasus would presumably be chosen by the Russian Government for the northern section of the Julfa- Mohammerah Railway, and would presumably be accepted by us, as we could oppose no valid argument against its adoption. Stations. —The terminus at Mohammerah would of course be carefully designed so as to permit of subsequent enlargement when it becomes necessary to handle large volume of traffic. The enclosed sketch map indicates the site which I believe to be most suit able for the terminus. Should there be any likelihood of the railway project materializing, it is worthy of consideration whether the Shaikh should not be approached by us with a view to reserving for railway purposes the piece of ground shown on the map. With a frontage directly opposite the accepted anchorage on the Shatt-al-Arab from which it would be easy to throw out piers at which seagoing vessels could unload direct into trucks, and with the Customs House close by, the site is in every way suitable for a large railway terminus.s tanks^fsupplf ^engine wkt iatosTouldVe'eS hLe. ab ' eh ° n ^ KarUn!

S S oa . w 1 ! 1 be apparent from the above description that from point of view this section presents no difficulties and should be cheaply. the engineering constructed very Local labour.—The, labour obtainable in Arabistan is of two kinds—Arab and rersian. The Arab, however, is too well off to be under the necessity of working with a spade at 2 krans a day and is constitutionally unfitted for regular and strenuous work. The experience of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company 3 has been that it is mainly upon Persian labour that reliance must be placed, but they have had no difficulty in obtaining 1,000 Arabs for work in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. In Ahwaz and elsewhere in Arabistan, Persian (Lur) labourers are plentiful and fairly satisfactory. Usual pay is 2 krans per diem (8 annas). Excavation is usually performed by basket and spade. The spades used locally are of a special long-handled type, but the experience of the Anglo-Per- sian Oil Company is that Lurs adapt themselves readily to the European pattern shovel and pick. Lurs and also Arabs work best in gangs under their own chiefs; unless some such arrangement is made they are apt to get out of hand, but they are on the whole easily handled and amenable to mild discipline. Fuel supply .—The Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s refinery at Braim, 5 miles from Mohammerah, is conveniently situated to supply oil fuel in any quantity, and it will be unnecessary to import coal. The Qilab oil springs a few miles north of Dizful are at present inaccessible on account of tribal difficulties, but were a railway through Luristan to be opened it is probable that the Oil Company would bore for oil there. Were oil to be struck, a great impetus would be given to the railway. The engines on the Russian section of the line will doubtless be fitted to burn oil, and it is fortunate that the southern section should be not less favourably situated in this respect. Financial. Probable cost per mile of Mohammerah-Dizful section .—Sir William Will- cocks has estimated the approximae cost of constructing and equipping a railway of 4 / 8 |' gauge in Arabistan at about ^ 3,000 per mile. Following his estimate, the total cost of this section would be about ^ 500 , 000 . Sir William quoted the6 above figure as an outside estimate and one upon which, under favourable circum stances, much saving might be effected. Local traffic .—It is not possible at this stage to give any reasoned estimate of the quantity of goods that would be carried by rail were the connection of Mohammerah with Sultanabad and Central Persia generally complete either by railorTad. But in regard to local traffic alone, it is possible to obtain some idea of the volume of produce which would be imported to be exported from Dizful by milway. The imports into Dizful from Mohammerah or Amarah are not large probably not more than 1,000 tons per annum. The exports are at the moment even smaller, owing to lack of communications. The existence of a ra'^ would afford a stimulus to agriculture and the exports of gram, reeds for pens! oil seeds, cotton, wool, gum, galls etc. would rapidly increase and might reach a total of 10,000 tons by the end of the third year. It is improbable that the railway, even were it to touch the Karun opposite Ahwaz 'would be able to secure an appreciable proportion of the imports and exports which are now transported by steamer between Ahwaz and Mohammerah and between Ahwaz and Ispahan by mules. 1 he river steamers will always be fn a position, as long as the river is not utilised for irrigation, to compete success- fully against the railway. Relation of railway to irrigation 'schemes in Arabistan.—Vxom iht fore- tfoimr paragraphs it is plain that the Mohammerah- Dizful Railway would have to feTy fonfs traffic mainly on the through traffic between Central Persia and the South, local requirements being almost negligible at the present mome t. But it must not be imagined that the low productivity of the country through which the railway passes is necessarily permanent. It is due to lack of security capha or communications. The construction of the railway w,l bring security' and a wise and moderate capital outlay on irrigation works at Kut Nahr Hashim’and Dizful by those responsible for the radway will not only be financially profitable in itself but will greatly increase traffic receipts. Any detailed reference to the Karkhah Irrigation Scheme would be out of place here and reference is invited to Sir W. Willcocks’ detailed reports on the subject. It is sufficient to say that he estimated that by a dam at Sinn ul-Abbas, e miles above Kut Nahr Hashim, an area of 100,000 acres could be irrigated by a ranital exoenditure of -f 1^,000 upon which a return of 20 percent was certain. The^eHistenoeof^a railway fron! Mohammerah to Kut Nahr Hashim would probably reduce the expenditure necessary from £l $&gt; 000 t0 * 5 0 ) 000 - But this scheme does not stand alone; millions of acres of potentially fertile land on the west bank of the Diz and on either side of the Shaur now he fallow and only await irrigation to give proof of a richness and productivity unequalled even in Mesopotamia.
