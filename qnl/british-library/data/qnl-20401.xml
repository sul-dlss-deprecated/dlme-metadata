They cannot hut helieve that this protest is 'based upon a misapprehension which the following explanation will remove. In reply to Your Majesty's letter of 17th s Novemher, in which anxiety was expressed lest Your Tajesty* rehellious suhjects when pressed should escape hy mixing with trihes in adjacent countries, and in which request was made that these trihes should he removed from the vicinity of the frontier, E.]'*s. Hepresentative informed Your Yajesty that measures would he taken to this end. Being under the impression that the Awazim had already entered or were ahout to enter Kuwait in order to seek sanctuary, E.M's. Government gave instructions that they as well as the Kuwait trihes should he ordered to move into the interior of Kuwait. 3uhseciuently however ILM's. Government learnt that the Awazim had not availed themselves of the permission given to move into Kuwait territory hut remained in the neutral area. On receipt of this informationinformation, in &gt;order tkat tbe dou'btful position of the AwaziiJ! might 'be cleared up and the assurances w iven to Your Majesty regarding the clearing or the frontier zone fully implemented, instructions were riven that a message should 'be sent to the Awazim to tbe effect that they must either move at once into the interior of Kuwait or xxxi alternatively texirsstixx they would he treaued as part of the contending forces, T-I.l^s. Government now learn that they have not entered Fuwait and instructions have therefore heen given for denial to them of all supplies from Kuwait and for use of force, if necessary, to expel'them should they cross the front ier.

COIT?IDT^TTIAL . r c c i My telegram Ho. 4b5 regarding disposal of Ihn Mashhur and his following: they are not Ilajdis but belong to Puwallah tribes from Syria. Undertaking given by His Majesty's u overnrnent and Iraq Government to Ibn Saud does not therefore appear to apply to them. Moreover Ibn Mashhur states Ibn Gaud has excluded them from offer of terras made to rebels or) the ground that he does not want them. I suggest therefore that Iraq Government, having settled their ovm account with them, should let them return to Syria. Please telegraph whether I may advise Iraq Government accordingly. As regards rebel Mutair and AJman; rebels on Kuwait-Iraq frontier with women and children are now refusing to re-cross ITaJd frontier even under threat of Iraq police cars, ^oyal Air j?orce armoured cars and aeroplanes. Mutair fugitives also women and children may be expected to cross into Iraq near ^iqai and adopt same attitude. The situation has therefore arisen of which Ibn Saud was warned by British Agent at Jeddah in paragraph b of his letter of the 16th October and which Ibn Saud has apparently taken no steps to avert. In the circumstances it is clearly impossible to bomb or shoot down rebels and alternatives are (a) as first proposed by the Iraq Government to expel them to foreign territory, e.g. Syria, and (bj / toto accept their surrender, arrest leaders and dis arm and intern remainder, the only condition being that they are not to 'be handed over to Bin Saud against their will. 1 have informed Prime Minister that (aj would not 'be acceptable to His LTaJettty's Govern ment and must he ruled out, (b) accords with demands 4 and b contained in aide memoir£enclosed in Jeddah despatch 'Mo. 306 of the 30th November and Iraq Govern ment have now agreed to this procedure. Since situation admits of no delay, local police and 'loyal Air Forec commanders have been instructed to take action accordingly. If rebels surrender as anticipated! leaders will be imprisoned and remai nc. e&lt;ff escorted to Jarishan on Iraq-Kuwait border where adequate grazing exists. Iraq Government can then settle account with rebels who have raided Iraq In t?re past and subsequent negotiations for their ultimate disposal with Ibn Saud. r HIGHGOMA. /lcjLcU' CT &lt;£&gt; *7^/- 4 7 ' I 3 I 'll r ITelrgram Coar.

I have already - in my telegram iTo. 55 - mentioned the doiTots entertained here i where Iraq, is- concerned as to the sincerity of the British attitude towards Ihn Saud and ? although credit is generally given for efforts made 'by His Majesty's Govern- -ment to carry out their undertakings, anxiety is still felt on this score. I am convinced that H.M*s. Govern- -ment will he held responsible tex and accountable for the action taken 'by the Iraq. Government towards Da wish and the rebels and that it will be interpreted as proving or disproving the sincerity of E.I:' * s. Government. Whatever the facts may be, there is a strong feeling that the Iraq, and Kuwait Governments have to some extent been playing Dawish*s game, and if the rebels are not now readily handed over or are only handed over under pressure, I fear the idea may become / established that I-I.M's, Government have connived this all along in spite of the categorical assurances given.

In view of this and of the fact that the rebels, so far as is known, are now in the neighbourhood of ^ 1 'neight)ourhood of the South-Western frontier of Kuwait, and that the transfer of a portion of the Kuwait tri'bes to the Eastern sector, far removed from the prohahle scene of conflict, should not prove emhaarrassing to the operations which Your Majesty is conducting, they are now informing the Shaikh of Kuwait that they see no objection to the return of his trihes to this area, S^OBETiliY OF STATIC FOE THE COLONIES. pc t/r'- hH.¥'s.

(^) In the first place, while recognising the force of your argument hased on demands 4 and 5 contained in the aide memoire enclosed in Jeddah despatch No. 306 of oOth Novemher, they do not feel that they can in fact confidently take their stand on this. It will he seen from Jeddah telegram No. 174 of S7th November, repeated to you, a letter from Bin Saud, written immediately 'before ITuad Hamza's communication, was received simultaneously, in which His Majesty asked specifically that rebels cross- -ing the frontier should he arrested and handed over. Though no specific guarantee to this effect was given 'by H.M's. Government, in replying they did inform the King that instructions had 'been given to concert necessary MMsoaxsaL military measures for the ejection of any of the contending forces that might enter Kuwait or Irag, territory and for the interception, wherever possible, of isolated groups of rebels entering such territory for the purpose of merging locally with tribes. 'While not committing • themselves on the question of handing over, they did not qualify these assurances by any reference to Fuad Ilamza's demands. It was for these reasons that the instructions inin my telegram Ho. 1 of January End were sent to you. (Id). As regards I 'on naslibur and his party H.M's. Government feel Gonside;ra'ble dou'bt whether they can take their stand on his Syrian status. Not only was he repudiated, hy his paramount chief in 19 26 and has severed all connection with Syria and embraced ^ahha'bism, hut his close connection with Syrian rebels and reference made to this position hy Thn Saud in recent correspondence (compare J addah * s telegram No. 63 of 17th Hay and telegram No. 68 of 25th I'ay, repeated to Baghdad), make it in their view doubtful whether he should not he considered as part of the contending forces . But I am prepared to leave it to Ihn 3aud to make representations regarding the dis- -posal of him and his party. In any case E.K*s. G-overn- -ment could not however agree that he should return to Syria except after reference to the French Government and with their consent. For the moment I suggest that the Irac). Government should take such action against him as may he justified hy his crimes against Iracx ( i n this connection please see paragraph (f) 'below ) and the Eigh Commissioner for Trans-Jordania will, no douht, consider whether the Trans-Jordanian Government should similarly take action against him in respect of the raid against the Beni Sakhr in February 1928. You will of course appreciate that the whole party must be kept under close surveillance, (c) H.M f s. Government, would be glad to learn the approximate numbers, if any, of rebels who have surrendered on the explicit understanding that they will not be handed over to Bin Saud against their will and whether they include any important reble leaders. They fully recognise that the pledge must be honoured. It will however be necessary to furnish explanation regarding it to Bin Saud, and they propose, subject to any observat- -ions that you. may offer, to inform him that while the I pledgeplGdgG is glVGn t&gt;0 pi^OludG tl^iG SUlTGndGP oX 4 'tllGSG OGOplG against thGir will, they will Tdg intGrned at safe distance until the end of hostilities, when their disposal will be settled in negotiation with him.

Iraq. Government request me to convey this in vitation to Bin Saud, Ends. Prime Minister explained' Faisal is very anxious to try and dissipate present atmosphere of distrust 'between Iraq, and Najd Governments 'by personal meeting with Bin Saud ana would be glad if I could take part in conference which would pro- . 'bahly he attended 'by Prime Minister and Cornwallis. MattersMatters now for discussion include : (a) Disposal of re'bel refugees; ('b) He turn of loot; {o) Breach of Article 4 ofBahrah Agreement; '(d) Extradition; (e) Treaty 'bon voisina^e ; (f) T 'ututai recognition of two G-overntiients whioi; is regarded as most important of all. Prima facie I am in favour of this pro- pos-il as feeling of hostility 'between Iracj, and Najd could hardly be worse and there seems a chance that even if conference fails to solve any outstanding questions 3 way might be prepared by personal contact for a better mutual understanding.

(b) To promise never again to allow any of his people to visit Kuwait for the purpose of purchasing provisions or hold any further c oromuni cat da on wi th Kuwai t • Shaikh Hillal, who I have found very trustworthy in the past, stated the above as a fact, I report it for what it is worth, I am inclined to believe the story,, 2* Shaikh liillal then went on to blame His Lajesty's Government for not understanding the real nature of the Kuwait-Nejd dispute, and censured me for not having properly shown up the tf villain of the Piece ,, Bin i^aud in his-real and true colours to His Majesty^ Government. 'Cannot your Government see', he said, T, that if they allow the Ajman and Mutair to settle peaceably in Kuwait and return to their old allegiance now, the days of peace and prosperity will once more settle dov /n on Kuwait, and we shall never again hear of another raid or attack from Nejd.

As you pointed out the other day at BaSRiiH the British lovernment does not wamt the Sheik of KUWAIT to imagine the British are going to be entirely responsible for the defence of his country, so I feel that the R.A.F. ought only to come into io when the raids become so big or so numerous^ that any for^e of desert police whioh the She Ik may reasonably be expected to maintain^canno t ccpe with them. I feel that the ordinary small r ^id ou^ht to be regarded as similar to a burglary in England and dealt wiLh by police. Also 1 have got to remember this, my real responsibility is 'IRAQ and the protection of ' 1 Ra (4 tribes must come first, 2 • i feel therefore that the basis on which the deience of KtHAlT against raids should be formed must be an efficient force of desert police in light cars similar to what ' IRAQ have no ,r got In their part of the desert, as you may know early last summer there was a conference at KUWAIT in which Oliver of my staff took part. He suggested on my behalf that the Sheik of KUWAIT should have a minimum of 12 armed ^ars and the Sheik at that time more or less promised to get them but I believe he still has no more than six, I am ready to help with regard to training his gunners or supplying machine guns and ammunition but J presume the Air /Ministry L ■Ministry will require the Sheik to pay for the la.tter» 3, I do not think a desert for^e of this nature would be any good unless run by an Englishmen, at any rate for the first year or two. There are one or two good Englishmen leaving the 'Iraq desert police shortly, amongst them BUTTOLPH who has really or^ainsed the 1 Iraq desert police during the last nine months. I have a very high opinion of him and am sure he could run the KUWAIT police well. a. This, however, is all looking far ahead, and does not solve the present problem. As you say the whole question of dealing .vith the r^ids is a question of time and I am sure that aeroplanes form the best means of catching raiders. But they must get information quickly, le have established a wireless station for Dickson in KU'VAIT, which will quioken up things a lot nut the Sheik ought really to fit out a couple of cars with w /T so that information can be sent in from the frontier at once. If you wish I arn prepared to let No. 84 Squadron go out on.recei t of emergency signals from Dickson without reference here which is the present rule. 5. I am against stationing a section of Armoured Gars at JaHRa . For one thing in order to keep them mobile the car section have to travel light and the men have a pretty hard time of it so I only have them out in the open when one has got^ fairly definite objective. 1 do not want to start a regular camp at KJ/AIT or JaHRA partly because r* ——aiw-ay.s /itit would raxher enocursine the armcured cars to expect a oamp always and partly because 1 have so few secLicns available that I must keep them ready to move about anywhere, ' • But I would send a se^uion out if Dickson got reliable information that a big raid was pending. I would also whenever possinle meet any request from Dickson for air reconnaissances.

I desire to invite your attention ta the con versation, which I had with Your Excellency re garding the recent transgressions, and serious losses that the unfortunate people of Kuwait have suffered at the hands of those tribes residing across the border and within the territories of H.M .King Bin Saud. I further desire to remind Your Hlzcellency of what I said regarding the further acts of hostility that will most certainly occur, as soon as the said li.k. King Bin Saud comes to terms with the rebels. Uy views on this subject have been very clearly stated to His Excellency the lion'ble the Political Resident in the ^ersian Gulf, Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe, when he honoured Kuwait with his recent visit - this also in your presence. I would now have you mark that the last four im mediate raids have taken place, and been committed before any actual understanding has been come to with the rebels t }iow much more then are we to expect aggressions and persecutions against our people, as soon as such agreement takes place. as you are aware the Awazim have raided within the last 10 days first our own shepherds in the ^ulaiah region, and have carried off all our private flocks, secondly they have done the same thing twice on two days in succession to the people of the al-^usur villages (Albu Halaifa) f Thirdly and only the day before yesterday they attacked our Araibdar people at the western end of the Kraa al i^aru in the heart of our State{ 'ol State (and close to tlie road to Basraii) and liave robbed them of many oamels. Tlie above and more lias been wantonly committed, yet we are patient, and have forcebly prevented the Araibdar tribes from committing reprisals or committing any hostile counter act against the Awazim who reside just across the border. We have indeed forbidden any counter measures and shall continue to do so in the interest of peace. That the above raids have been committed by the Awazim at the instance of, and by the clearly given consent of H.M.King Bin Saud, there is no room for any doubt whatever. The reason of my recapitulating the above facts to Your Sjccellency is not only to protest but to request you to Xook into the matter, with the eye of carefulness, and justice, lest greater transgressions, bloodshed and hostile acts generally are committed against us and in the near futureo The stoppage of such acts is, as I have already many times explained to Your Excellency not a difficult matter at all, if only the High Government takes a firm line with His Majesty King Bin Saud, Usual Ending.COIS'IDrl.''-TAL &gt; Political Agency, Kuwait, D.0»No # 16. Dated ls^.January 1930. ^rv-^ X^v' ^ ^'H /&gt;-» • i As a continuation of my deaxs^cfril^b ^C ! ^ja%e( ^ :'*—TT* r«T — qnjji January 1930, 1 am writing to say that His Excellency tlie Sliailcli presented his letter of protest, forwarded to you in my above mentioned c camuni cat ion, himself, on the evening of the 30th December, calling in person at my house at the very unusual hour of 7 p.m. for the purpose. As the Shaildi's conversation with me reflects the \ highly disturbed state of his mind at the present time, and as this is causing me some anxiety, I propose repeat ing to you the gist of what he said,below. Tlie Shaikh appeared highly excited on arrival, and complained that he was worried beyond words both by the recent Awazim raids and the news that al-Duwish had on the 29th December been defeated by Bin Saud's forces. This I myself had told him of in the morning though it has not been confirmed yet# After a few common place politenesses the Shaikh excitedly broke ©ut into a tirade against His Majesty's G-overnment^ saying that they did nothing but order him to carry out every form of measure detrimental to Iiis own interests and those of his state, and to make matters worse he was never asked his views on any orders so given, but just told to obey like a child. Furthermore H.M's Grovernment were in most unfair manner taking advantage of his loyalty to tie his hands and prevent him resisting whenever any unfair order was passed. At the same time E.M's Government were granting every The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel H.V.Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e./d^T) every request preferred 'by Ms rival Bin Saud, even wlien snoh. concerned liis o;m interests and Ms oy /n peopla To crown all HJvPs G-overnment liad forced a friend ly Awazim v/ho might have been made most useful defenders of Kuwait and wlio liad expressed a desire to return to their allegiance, back into the enemy's camp and had deprived him of his rightful Ajman and Mutair assist ance so oft offered, just because foresooth Bin Saud had declared them to be his tribesmen after stealing them away from Kuwait. Having thus rendered him the ahailch of Kuwait quite helpless against his powerful enemy, and at the bidding of that self same enemy, H.M's Government left him in the awlcward situation of having to beg them to be responsible for the defence of his Town, tribes, frontiers, and subjects generally, whether from heavy attack or petty raid: 'A nice situ ation for the grandson of Mubarak', he said. After I had calmed the Shaikh down some what Y/ith several cups of coffee, he returned to the attack, and asked how it was that Ur. PMlby could do things on behalf of Bin Saud, and I was unable to get anything done for him with my G-overnment. Bin Saud, he said, had merely to express the smallest wish to Mr. Philby and the latter got H.M* s Government to comply with same. 'Yfithout doubt', he said, 'Mr. Philby was guiding H.M 1 s G-overnment * s policy today where Bin Saud was concerned ? and guiding it well'. The Shaikh then stated that he was going to England to lay his case before King G-eorge in London. 'If Shaikh Mubarak had been alive, he would never have acted as foolishly as I have done', he added, 'He would never have refused supplies to the rebels, and would have opened his port to them from the first, nay he virould have led them in person against Bin Saud and chastised that upstart for his ingratitude'. Not allall the orders of Political Agents, lie opined, would ^ have prevented his grand father from working for the K interests of his State. His present troubles and de fenceless state were of course due to his trying to please li. M 1 s Government. Before leaving at a rather late hour, Shaikh Ahmad recovered himself sufficiently to apologize for having forgotten himself and spoken so openly, but said he had been compelled to speak out, in order to ease the fires of his 2iind. The Shaikh*s outburst contained nothing really new as you will observe, but coupled with the rather •definite attitude v/hich he has adopted of late is interesting. He, of course, is firmly convinced that the Awazim raids were committed under orders of Bin Saud and are merely the precursors of a big attack,as soon as the rebels are dealt wiUi. In this I do not think he is very far wrong, unless we stop it. But that he appears to have decided on a policy of not co operating so freely with me as he used to do, gives cause fcr thaught, for I think it proves that he is getting into the hands of those undesirables in the town who are for ever preaching that the English are not really friends and will sell his city on the first opportunity if it suits their policy. This new attitude of mind is exemplified by Shaikh Ahmad*s recent obvious lack of keenness in dealing with the Ajman, whom his chauvinistic advisers are straining every nerve to keep on or just inside the frontier on the plea that they will be Kuwait♦ salvation when the 'shock' comes, and H. M. t s Groverriment finds a convenient excuse to back out of their promises. Of course, I am doing my best, by almost daily visits, to put heart into the Shaikh, and never cease encouraging him to continue to put his trust in H. M's Government, and in particular to come and take my advice whenever some of his so called friends have upset himjaim witli too muoli of their cynical and anti-Englisli talk# Glianaing tliougli 'tlie Siiaildi is, X fear lie is not as strong as lie miglit be. He is also t! an afraid' man undoubtedly, and last 'but not least is a 'lonely' man. Standing 'by us, as lie has done for so long, lias orouglit Mm mucli unpopularity with his people, and I cannot think really of a single member of his family who can be called/loyal to him. This applies equally ?^ell to some of Kuwaiti most prominent citizens, many of whom are 'defeatists', and have been got at by Bin Saud in the past, and a^e again being got at today through Hafith Y/ahba. It is rather pathetic to hear the Shaikh say, as he ha^ done on several occasions of late, that in ioiwait he has only one friend and that is myself. The change in the Shaikh 1 s attitude and outlook generally, has been remarked on by Dr. Mylrea O.B.E., the popular linglish missionary doctor, who has lived in Kuwait for the last 19 years and of whom I have a high opinion. Dr # Iviylrea recently returned from 18 months 1 leave, and took the trouble to come round and see me about the Shaikh, whom he was worried^bout professionally. Dr. Mylrea incidentally in discussing causes, asked me if I thought H. M* s Government would really defend Kuwait if it were suddenly attacked by Bin Saud. He also asked whether it had struck H. M' s Government that all past attacks on Kuwait were done by Bin Saud* s orders, and whether they realized that any fresh attacks or raids would equally be by Bin Saud 1 s orders. He then said M 0f course, H.M 1 s Government can stop every single raid, if it chooses, by a firm threat to break with Bin Saud from the start. Dr. Mylrea took pains to add that nothing would happen till Duwish had been dealt with. Dr. Mylrea's questions, I think you will agree, were distinctly illuminating. I have repeated the above at perhaps unnecessary length, because I think you should be aware of thetiie clianges I liave noticed. What I recomiiiend, and tiiink ttie Sliaikii is in need of, is a big pat on the 'baok and word of encouragement from H. M 1 s Grovernment. A visit to England as H. M* s j ay 1^5 ■ guest would not come amiss Y /lien ids troubles are over ; ^ He is obsessed with, tlie feeling common to many otiier Arabs today, that Bin Saud is the 'big noise' and every- '/ thing that counts, and that H. LPs Government fears him and will give him all he asks for. The whole hearted support of H. M* s Government as exemplified by the strong anti-rebel pressure, which has been maintained along the ?fhole southern frontier of ■ •Iraq, and ICuwaLt by the Royal Air Force, not to mention the sale and maning of aeroplanes, has definitely con firmed this belief. And where it is obvious to all that our assistance means the definite failure of the rebellioo. and the practical destruction of the great Ajman and Mutair tribes, Kuwait's protectors since earliest times, and largely the Shaikh's own kith-and-kin, one can see how deeply their present desparate plight affects the Shaikh.

After Compliments, We received Your Excellency's letter dated Srd Rajab 1348- bill December 1929 No. 1604 sent by you on behalf of the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Seeing that it was to the Hon T ble the Political Resident necessary to expedite reply/we despatched five cars to Kuwait on ; U the 15th Rajab- 17th December to take the reply. We were then at Lisafah. The cars remained two days at Kuwait and then returned without reply from any British authority about the Military stations or any information as to the measures taken to eject the enemies from the Kuwait and 'Iraq frontiers. On the evening of the 23rd Bajab 1348 ( 24th December ) a detachment of our armoured cars attacked the enemy at the out - skirts of Riq_'i and inflicted loss on him, and ascertained that the } ■ enemy was still within Kuwait and 'Iraq territory at the junction ol i Al-'Aujah at the Batin ? and some of them (enemies) are at Mahzul. We have just started to Hafr al-Batin but have so far received no reply from the British G-overnment about the situation. We have therefore informed Your Excellency in order to communicate the same to His Excellency the High Commissioner for 'Iraq and the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf about the present situation. There is only a distance of one and a half days journey between us and the enemy, but the enemy is still within 'Iraq and Kuwait territories. The British forces should either eject the , enemy from the frontier or permit us to attack him. -- We will try our best to send this information to the nearettMilitary station# at the frontier. We intended to send this information tkKiaiagk to Kuwait but as the enemy is between us and Kuwait,it was not possible | to send the information through this route. We expect the reply of the British Government as earl^ as possible in carrying out their i! ' ! pledges. It is very difficuilt to keep our forces confronting the. &amp; / A ^ J enemy without taking measures against them owing to their taking shelter within ?

Apart from personal factor which I have pointed out this seems to me to put mission on wrong 'basis. I ta ce it that we are sending Dickson, who is personal friend, of 'Bin Saud's, to have friendly discussion regarding disposal of rebels, and imagine that His Majesty's Government would he ready to meet Bin Saud's wishes as far as possible, subject to two conditions (1) thf.t settlement arrived at shall not offend local sentiment and (ii) that Bin Saud shall give guarantees that persons handed over to him shall not be put to death and shall receive reasonable treatment. If this view is correct, it would seem undesirable to send mission headed military officer M to announce orders'. If we can settle disposal of refugees in first instance then question of Kuwait and Iraq claims and other cognate matters might be left for discussion at subsequent meeting between Faisal, Bin Saud and Shaikh of Kuwait. Another way out of difficulty would tee for me to head mission myself taking Dickson as my Assistant and in this case, if Baghdad still desired it, there would be no objection to Burnett♦s being the 'Royal Air Force representative.

From remarkaTDly friendly messages I received tonight from Itm Saud, I am convinced more than ever that ua we are making a mountain out of a fairly easily settled business. My advise is to play for the return of the leaders to Ihn Saud, and if we can get the latter to for- -give them with full promise of life and fair treatment under signed document to H.M's. Government, a thing I am almost prepared to accomplish alone, the leaders themselves with their following will he the first to express desire to return. ^ - My man says that Ihn Saud is heartily sick of the whole business, anxious only now not to lose the two greatest of his desert Ohiefs, which would serious- -ly affect his prestige.

H.M's. Government tiave carefully considered the question of the disposal of the rehel refugees in the light of your views and those of High Oommissioner and have reached the following conclusions. (1) In view of the importance of the issues involved and of the delicate situation which has arisen, they consider it in the highest degree desirable that you yourself should assume personal charge of the mission to Ihn Saud and should take with you 'both Dickson and, subject to the High Oommissioner , s consent, Burnett, to whose presence as aosx a military adviser H.M*s. Government attaches great importance. They trust that you will immediately put in train the necessary arrangements for your mission in consultation with the Air Officer Command- -ing. It seems desirable that, if practicable, you should take a wireless set with you to Ibn Saud's camp. ■ A ' / .S ^ ^ ^ (2) Jeddah telegrams Nos. 7 and' 8 and Baghdad / , 6 b A/H? telegrams Nos. 34 and 35, all repeated to you, have been carefully considered. Having regard to the fact that the assistance ai and cooperation of the military forces of H.K*s• Government have been the dtEci determining factor in the suppression of the revolt against Ibn Gaud, they cannot but take eception to the tone of recent communicat- -ions from him and ( ? ais ) Government. In the circumstances they consider that a dignified and stiiTf remonstrance1 % ^ \ , : ' remonstrance is called fn-r mv, 'I /o) o r• They consider however that it is preferable that this should he conveyed by word of mouth rather than hy communication. on your arrival at Bin Saud's camp you should therefore explain to him that E• lui.* s• Government never agreed to hand over rebels who might surrender and, as has already heen explained to him, the only thing that prevented H.M's. Government from expelling the rehel trihes prior to their surrender was that they were accompanied hy their women and children, against whom effective military action could not he taken. t/VU6^ You should rem&amp;isg. I'bn Saud that he was warned of this contingency so long ago as the mdddle of October, You should leave him in no douht as to the exception taken 'by ii.M's. Government to his recent communications. ( You fa. should know for that H .M 's. Government does not regard themselves as committed and cannot agree to unconditional surrender or to surrender on conditions repugnanb to Arah custom or British tradition ), ( 3 ) H.M*s. Government note that hoth you and High Commissioner consider that the deportation of the Mutair and Ajman leaders would 'be the alternative least open to political ohjection. They assume that the leadersi if faced with the alternative of surrendering to Ihn Saud or of deportation, would willingly choaae the latter. You will appreciate that t&amp;s compulsory deportation wotiAdL he extremity difficult to justify on juridicial grounds and might involve H.M f s. Government in serious legal difficulties. Even voluntary deportation, however, is open to serious objections on Ihe expense, which, I understand from you, would have to he 'borne hy H .M* s. Government. This expense might expose H.M's. Government to criticism in Parliament, especially as the liability once incurred might continue indefinitely. It is also open to objection trsam on the gr^ound of legal difficulty attaching to the transfer of the leaders and their detention in a British colony. UnlessUnless therefore you feel strongly that the alternative ' of handing over the rehel leaders to Ihn Saud is politlc- -ally impraotloahle and that no undertaking given Try him ( even ^ formally assumed towards H.M 's. Government) would tie outficienb to ensure humane treatment and satisfy Arab sentiment and at the same time to protect Ira 4 and Ji 'LI l J'I &amp;, 1 0 f if 021 J '5 rl q tt n/r # „ n iat^ao, H• M s• G-overnment much prefer not to adopt deportation. (4i If however you are satisfied that the depor ation of leaders is essential H .M 's. Government authorise you to inform I ton Saud that they see no alternative to tae adopuion of that course. H .M 's. Government have not however yet decided whether to choose Cyprus or some other colony.as place of exile and you should avoid committing yourself on this point. In communicating the foregoing to Ihn Saud you should make every effort to t rendei 1 it palatable and to secure his concurrence. 'SFou might explain that in all the circumstances deportation is obviously the hest course to adopt, 'both from his point of view and that of H .M 's. Government as (a) in- -flicting on the leaders the extreme 'banishment of exile, (h) removing them from all possibility of raiding or rebellion and (c) satisfying British sentiment and sav- -ing the face of the local Sulers, the importance of which he will no doubt appreciate. You are yourself in a postion to speak as to the feelings of the Shaikh of Kuwait. If in spite of your utmost endaevours you i are unsuccessful in persuading Ibn Saud to acquiesce in deportation you should, without giving any indication that H.M's. Government are prepared to modify their attitude, ascertain and communicate to me his own opinion as to the conditions which should govern the surrender of the leaders, and should inform him that you have no auth- -ority to diseuss any alternative solutions but must report to H.M's. Government for further instructions. (5)(5) If on uhe other hand you do not feel that deportation is very ewsentiai, you^endeavour to obtain from Bin 3aud written and binding guarantees, that if leaders are handed over, (a) their lives and those of i&amp;sa their relatives will he spared^ (h) Any punishment inflicted shall not he excessive or such as to outrage Arah senuiments or run counter to British tradition^ (c) Effective measures will he taken to eliminate possibility of Iraq, or Kuwait to suffer further at their hands* (6). His Majesty's Government note that it is considered unlikely that Ihn 3aud would wish to punish rank and file of rehel tribes with undue severity but in their case also it is clearly important to satisfy local and humanitarian sentiment. Gosequently before agreeing to hand them over you should obtain from Ibn Saud guarantees similar to those suggested in paragraph 5 above and of a nature which, in your opinion, the refugees themselves could reasonably be required to accept. 7. As regards question of necovery of loot His Majesty•s Government do not feel they are on very strong ground, Iraqi and Kuwaiti claims for compensation have never been accepted by Ibn 3aud and as regards Iraq Ibn Saud is understood to present large counter claims. Moreover special machinery for adjusting of such claims is provided for in the Bahra agreements. His Majesty's Govei'nment doubt therefore whether they sa&amp;i could take matter into their own hands and seize property of refugees to satisfy local claims or alternatively could make restoration of loot a condition of surrender of refugees. On the other hand they realise that once the refugees have been surrendered Iraq and Kuwait will not be in very strong position to demand restoration of loot. In 411 the circumstances His Majesty's Government can only leave it to you to do what in your judgement is practicable at this stagestage 'but trust at least it will ]De possible to obtain''' satisfactory guarantees from Bin Saud on this point. You ^ill appreciate that question will inevita'bly be raised in later discussion with Iraq, and Kuwait and it is therefore very desirable to clear ground so far as possible at once. (^) position • Ihn Mashur (whose surrender has novj 'been demanded 'by Ihn Gaud) is not (juite on all fours with that of the other rehel leaders (see Baghdad's tel; 456 or December 31st and my reply No 6 of January 4th). It Bin Saud raised the question you should emphasise this disparity and explain that Ihn Mashur is at present in custody of Iraq. Government and nxXl that guestion of his ultimate disposal can 'better he handled at subsequent meeting with King Faisal. (9). Finally His i^Jesty's G-overnment would he glad to he assured that the three principal Sheikhs only are concerned in proposals for deportation and that thirty may be regarded as maximum number of persons who must accompany them. They assume that £ 50 per head per annum would cover cost of their maintenance hut would he glad of confirmation. They are anxious to reduce party to absolute minimum consistant with object in view and trusts that it may be possible to reduce total . t below 33. In particular they feel under no obligation to deport and maintain full complement of female relatives or children of leaders unless surrender of these persons to Bin Saud would lay His Majesty's Government open to charge of inhumanity. Subject to your views His Kajes ty*s Government are disposed to think that governing consideration should be whether persons to be deported would be exposed to risk of death or barbarous treatment if handed to Bin Saud.

He has asked me t® agree to half a company of Assyrian Levies being sent in motor cars to Kuwait territory to assist the R.A^F.

As regards the possibility of their mixing with Kuwait tribes, the Shaikh has already issued orders that they are not to be allowed to camp with latter, and I understand that they are at present well separated. Even if some intermingling occurred they would sort themselves out when settlement was arrived at and follovr their own chiefs» In the circamstances employment of Assyrian Levies in Kuwait territory would not seem to be necessary.

(1) Neither among leaders cr tribesmen shall any person be put to death. (2) The punishment to be awarded shall not be contrary to Arab sentiment. He has given me private assurances that he proposes to insist on Bawish and other leaders submitting publicly to hira and that he will keep them under surveillance either in Riyadh or in camp with him in the same manner as Ibn Rashid, Ibn Bijad, Shaikh of the Ataibah, and others who have fought against him have been treated. As regards tribes he proposes to take from them all camels, sheep etc. which they have stolen and will probably order them to reside in specified area for some time to come, (3) He undertakes to take effective steps to prevent raids into Kuwait or Iraq in future and should raids by Mutair or AJman occur he accepts fu3_l responsib— -ility for them and undertakes to pay compensation for all property stolen and blood money for anyone killed. (4) As regards Kuwait he agrees, should the Shaikh desire it, to Commission on analogy of that pro- videi in Bahra Agreement to exajnine .claims between Kuwait and Nejd, and is also ready, should the Iraq Government desire^71 desire it, to agree to Commission under Bahra Agreement for settlement of claims between Nejd and Iraq and accepts responsibility for any claims found by Commission due from him. Ibn Saud's attitude is very conciliatory now. He has expressed regret for tone of notes sent by his Minister for Foreign Affairs. He is, with suppression of this revolt and that of the Ataibah, stronger now than he has been for some time past and therefore will probably be able to enforce his orders for some time to come. He is ready to confirm the above arraggement by exchange of letters. Chief Staff Officer is of opinion that permanent peace on the -Iraq Mejd frontier cannot be guar- -anteed without deportation of leaders and return of loot before surrender of tribesmen, and I share this view. We realise however the force of the considerations men- -tioned in paragraphs 3 and 7 of your telegram under reply and desirability of early settlement.

Crovernment have hitherto adopts -ed a most friendly attitude towards Ibn Saud, and assist- -ed him in very many ways. The original intention was that the rebels should be denied access to Iraq and Kuwait, and simply pushed back to Ibn Saui. This has not proved possible and they are now our prisoners. H.M's. Government are still, I assume, perfectly ready to hand them bade to their friend e u c Ibn Saud, but they must take into account Arab sentiment^ and naturally desire to be assured that these tribes shall not be allowed to harry the border in future, and that Ibn Saud shall arrange to settle outstanding claims. To speak of capitulation seems to me to ignore our friendly relations with him, which Ibn Saud also empha^ie- -ed very strongly. arrangement can bring about an entire cessation of raiding among Arab tribes, but, if met in friendly spirit, I think Ibn Saud will do his best and is now stronger than before.

You arrest Judge of what can be secured from Ibn Sand and H.M's. Government leave you full discretion. But they feel strongly that in the case of the leaders ( and perhaps their immediate male relations or any of their lieutenants who might replace them as raid leaders ) specific undertaking should be obtained in the proposed exchange of notes to the effect that they Till be kept permanently under control at Riyadh or other centre equally distajnt from the, frontier or in camp under Ibn Saud 1 s immediate surveillance. In the case of the tribes we do not wish to raise the question of time limit, but it is essential to make siu^e that the period during which they will be restricted to specified area shall be sufficient to reduce the risk of recrudescence to minimum. In view of Ibn Saud f s now declared intention to take from the rebels camels, sheep, etc. which they have stolen, you will no doubt consider the possibility despite paragraph 7 of my telegram dated 15th January Fo. 14, nf recur^nrr pome undertaking as regards thethe restitution of Kuwaiti and Iraqi loot independently c.nd in anticipation of the arrangements referred to inycmr condition {4).

The latter has in fact exercised the discretion given him in paragraph 5 of that telegram by H.II 1 s.

It would be impossible at this stage to go back on the arr- -angeraents now provisionally made by him with Ibn Saud in accordance with the instructions of Government. Nor can they agree that the Iraq Government have any locus standi as regards the disposal of the rebels and their leaders other than Ibn Mashur, whose case is not now in question. The efforts of H.M's. Gov -ernment have been cons istent3,y directed to keeping con- -trol of this matter in their own hands. The leaders of the tribes, with the exception of (Dbn Mashur, have surrendered in Kuwait and to the R.A.F. and in deference to the Iraq Governments v/ish we have acquiesced in Iraqi forces not being used to round up the rebels.

Up to the present their duties have been as follows Firstly, shepherding the rebels into a small ares, Secondly, moving them into the North West corner of Kuwait, Thirdly, protecting them against attempts by Iraqi tribesmen to recover some of their sto3.en property. The rebels are now collected in the North West corner of Kuwait but the problems of water and gsr- ~ing are making it increasingly difficult to keep them there. The rebels are also becoming less amenable to control. As regards the third duty the Royal Air Force have already arrested some Iraqis and restored to the rebels the flocks of ^heep that the Iraqis were driving off.

Our forbearing in the past from carrying on a wide punitive movement was for fear of the rebels seeking shelter and the recurrence of the tragedy of Yusuf as-Sa'dun and those who were with him. We are confident that such a tragedy will never recur in view of the clear written promises which repeatedly came from the British Government, of whch a large proportion came through Your Excellency, but, to our great regret, the same has recurred and the rebels have finally taken shelter in adjacent territory and surrendered to it. the British Mission and selecting its members from those who are expert in the subject, and we were greatly pleased when ing those who were once our favourite subject All this We have drawn a good omen from your presiding over wewe saw that the matter was on the point of finishing and that nothing remained except the signing of the two letters agreed upon. ¥e were expecting the handing over of the rebels within those two days, hut it was to our surprise and astonishment to hear your conversation last evening of what you told us that you have received new instructions from your Government after we had agreed with you upon all points, and that these instructions demand that the leaders of the rebels should not he handed over 'by force, that is that the leadBrs* opinion should be taken and arrangements made for them which would make them prominent, and the souls of evil people approve of committing crimes. This, as you will see, will create serious difficulties for hoth you and anxxslXEEjBS- ourselves, which perhaps may lead to the loss of the good efforts made for ending this problem and to the failure of our HKEgii negotiations. We were also surprised at the demand for handing over a fixed number of camels beforehand, which may be due to what some of our enemies have said, that we shall not pay in the future. This dishonours our respect and hurts our feelings. Meanwhile please note that we were not the cause of failure in the application of the Bahra Agree- -ment because we sent Shaikh Hafidh Wahbah in-1926 to discuss the question of plunder, and he stayed in Kuwait for about six months. He also returned to Kuwait in November 1927 and stayed there for about two months for the same purpose but he did not find anybody to discuss matters with in .this behalf. It has been reported to me from Kuwait after last midnight that some men disembarked from the man of war which is carrying the leaders for the purpose of taking some necessities for the leaders themselves, andtold Dawisti's women that Dawish says that tie is expecting a good omen, that he will not 'be handed over to Ihn Saud, that the British Government will protect them and their property,and i&amp;xi Dawish*s women rejoiced at the news. • Our trust in the British Governments promises make us 'believe that such a thing would never 'be, hut the delay in settlaia ing this question may leave the worst effect on the aouls of the leaders of trihes and as-Saud's family, because we have 'been giving them the hope of settling the problem in accordance with the promises which the British Government took upon itself. ¥e are afraid that they may come to know this talk tomorrow or the day after, their souls may he affected and they may impote the charge of falsehood to us in regard to what we have already informed them. It will also create many problems for us and therefore we ask you (i) to settle the problem according to what we have agreed upon in the letters which we have agreed to exchange, (ii) He would like that any discussion which may take place between us in this matter should be in writing in order that we may remove the responsibility from our shoulders towards the Government of Nejd.

The matter which increases its critical nature is what has been reported to aajpda me by my rep- -resentatives regarding the discussion which took place 'between Your Excellency and them and your stipulation for handing over of the rebels that we should promise to hand over 1000 or 800 camels from the property of the rebels. My representatives have told you that we i are prepared to enforce the Bahra agreement one month after any time aStKBoat we may be asked to do so. the pilgrimage season being excluded. Moreover they have told you that we are prepared to hand over a suit- -able munber of camels recovered from the rebels, that these will be one third of what may be recoverea from them, and have put forward many suggestions for assur- -ing you of the one third which will be handed over to Iraq, from those recovered from the rebels, but you refused all these offers and stipulated that we should promise you in an official letter that we will hand ever about 800 or 1000 Kami camels from those recovered from the rebels. As you will see. this dishonours our respect and is contrary to the existing undertakings between us and the British Government, which does not urge us to do any such thing. Therefore, if the stipulation urging usus to hand over the number you mentioned is held to by you, we regret to say that we cannot accept it: if it he an order issued by the British Government please write us an official letter on behalf ot the British Government that it presses us to pay the number of camels mentioned by you, and we shall later arrange matters in our interests and preserve our honour^ We haveneither broken promises of ours to the British Government nor have we dela3 r ed in applying the Bahra Agreement but, from the beginning we were willing to enforce it! we informed you in our previous letter of the efforts we took to enforce the Bahra Agreement. Twice we sent Hafiz Wahba to Kuwait for the purpose of resolving this matter but he could not do anything. We are still prepared to enforce the Bahra Agreement as we wrote to you. We do not consider it good for either -party to render matters turbid with such difficulties which, we think, arises only from lack of turst in our promises, which we have never broken inthe whole ofour personal history.61/14. TRANSLATION. From ^he Hon'ble the Political P.eBident in the Persian Gulf, at Ibn Saud's Camp. H.M, the King of the He1a,z S r Feid etc. No. 4 • Bp.ted ^6th Sha, t ban 1?48 (S6th J' p nu ary 1930}. Y A.C. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of / Your Majesty's two letters Nos. 2/2/141 and 2/3/147, dated the 25th ana 26th Sha f ban (25th and 26th January) respectively, for which I thank you. Before replying to the other points you mention I wish to assure Your Majesty that you have been mis- ~informed regarding the statement which Bawlsh is alleged to have made. ^he most strict steps have been taken to prevent any communication whatsoever between any of the reb£^ chiefs on H.M f s. Ship and their relation -s and friends ashore. As regards the questionof the cainels I fear that there has been some misunderstanding. After rny discussions with Your Majesty I reported to H.M 1 s. Govern- -ment the assurances that Your Majesty was prepared to give regarding the prevention of raids, and the treatment of the rebel lea.ders and tribes, and regarding the settlement of claims in accordance with the Bahra Agree- i -ment. They expressed their pleasure at these. At the same time they informed me that a.s some delay must occur in bringing about a final settlement of claims unaer the Bahra Agreement, and there are many poor shepherds a.nd others who have suffered at the hands of these rebels, s. Government consider it only just that some restitution should be made to them in anti- -cipation of the fina.l settlement. In this request there was no intention of impugning Your Majesty's good faith: it was simply made mades / ' made in order to obtain for the triben, in whose welfare H.M's. Government are interested, some .small compensate -ion at an early date. I am sure that Your Majesty will realise that this request is just and reasonable. In the discussions that I have had wiUi Yoiu Majesty and Your -Majesty's representatives on the sub- -jest various proposals have beenput forward and I believ that Your Majesty is ready to meet the wishes of H.M 1 s. Government as far as is possible, having regard to the interests of your own subjects. It has beensuggested that the tribes should be collected at Jahra or sore such place and that after leaving to them such creels, sheep etc. as are necessary for their subsistence the balance should be divided up and a portion handed over by the Nejd authorities to the British authorities as compensation for the tribesmen from whom they have been stolen. I do not think this arra,ngement would be suitable as it is for Your Majesty to punish these people if these tribes are handed over. It has also been suggested that after Your Majesty has ascertained how many stolen camels etc. the rebi^ tribes have in their possession some proportion of these animaits, say one third, should be handed over to some representative of the British Government wo will be sent down to the area, in which they a.re residing. I feel that there are many practical difficulties in the way of this suggestion. Your Majesty and I both have many pre- -occupations. The matter would inevitably have to be left to subordinate officials a,nd I feel that there is a. great danger that disputes might arise etc. It was for this reason and because I foresaw these difficuit- -ies that I suggested in informal discussion with Your Majesty's representatives that it would be preferable to fix some definite number of camels, so as to avoid any possibility of disputes between local representat- -ives andand obviate the necep^ity of Pending a representative to the area in which the tribes are residing ikxi. I true this explanation will remove from Your Majesty's mind any feeling that the request of H.M 1 s. Government is based on a distrust of Your Majesty's guarantees or that ray informal suggestion is based on anything except pract -ical considerations. i I note withpleasure that Your Majesty is will- i -ing to agree to the setting up 6f thetribunal r ^ xxx specified in the Bahra Agreement at any time at a month 1 notice, the month of Zi-HaJ being excluded.

Ton Saud has agreed to set up tribunal under Bahra Agreement any time at one month's notice. Then, as suggested in paragraph (a) of your telegram I asked that some restitution should be maae independently and in anticipation of Bahra agreement and proposed that 1000 camels should be delivered within a month of tribes T return, Ibn Saud ho.s offered to collect tribes in specified area where he will take from them stolen camels and British authorities can send representative to be present while this is being done, and he will had over to him one third of total camels which are ta,ken from the rebel tribes, and send them up to frontier. He absolute ly refuses however to specify any number on the ground that he has no idea how many camels will be forthcoming. Without some minimum figure however I think arrangement would be oflittle value 4 except as gesture, since there would probably be collusion between Nejdi officials and tribesmen to conceal camels etc. I am making further efforts today.

As Resident is negotiating with Ibn Sand terms on which rebel tribes should be handed back it is clearly necessary that they should be kept under control and that every effort should be made to prevent Kkx their dispersal into Iraq or Nejd or mixing with Kuwait tribes in order that when Biscoe f s negotiations are completed H.M*s. Government may be in a position to consider how they can carry out their share of the bargain. The responsibility of the R.A.F. must therefore continue until that time.

Had he dr.nA oh to ^ejd without the rebel leaders being handed over to him, what would L vp )een the position ? It would not have been possible permanently to stop the rehpl Mutair and Ajman from returning to Nejd territory, which is their home- Ibn SanH tt ould thus have been provided with a weapon ready to his hand, and, thouo-h if is tue that these tribes would have been deprived of their principal leaders &amp; othpr&lt; \vould ,iave been forthcoming, and, with Ibn Saud in hostile mood and these tribes again at his disposal, I think there would have been a strong probabilitv of a' lecrudescence of organised raiding all along the border in the near future. It is 0 course, possible that Ibn Saud may not fulfil his undertakings, though personallv believe that he intends to do so, and that organised raiding under his orders and with his encouragement will cease for at any rate some time to come; but I do think that the risk of organised raiding is very much less now than it would have been on baud returned to Nejd with what he would have considered a definite grievance against His Majesty's Government. I have stressed the expression organised raiding , that petty cattle-lifting raids may occur from time to time is of course, possible; they are more or less in the nature of a local pastime and of unportance, and are totally different matters to organised raiding carried out with the encouragement or under the orders of the King. o there is one other consideration to be borne in mind and that is the projected air route down the Gulf. A portion of this route runs through Neid territory, and we have tried m the past to obtain certain facilities from Ibn Saud p 0 ^^] 61 ^ 110 ^ fV? g grounds, &amp;c., but these facilities have hitherto been refused ossibly one of the considerations that induced His Majesty's Government to sudd I v The? win 8 T 0 ^ b \ S t Ud was that these mi - ht ''duce hinf to change Ws attitude It} will I think, be on stronger ground to renew their requests and he will be '' ^ - 1 f; , '' s Majesty s Government insisted that the surrender of the rebel leaders H m I ^' T u W to Ce bHn^ h tf ab H Senti r^ 1 theref0re as ^ed^ the commander of s i, ^ g „,. , His M.).., : hn wlh 0 r e thanked nie P 1 ; 0 ^. and said he was qnite wiSlmf Z lo baek Ibn Hithlain is an impossible person to deal with.

Slidr r j &gt; 4 in the discussion with the Ministers, it was agreed to fix the payment for the 5th Shawal. The 1st of Shawal is a very important Mahometan festival, which generally lasts two or three days at the end of the month ot Ramzan, and this delay will allow them to make the payment after the festival is completed. The 5th Shawal is the 6th March. 1 regret that, owing to a miscalculation. I stated in my telegram No. T. 37 of the 28th January that it was the 3rd March. 8. The evening was spent in drafting his letter to me embodying the agreement, and the following morning, about 11 a.m ., the notes were exchanged. His Majesty inspected the 'Victorias and the escort of 'Capitis, and soon atter 12 we returned by air to Koweit. Air-Commodore Burnett was most anxious to arrange to move the tribes down, and I felt that it was essential that the matter should be finally settled without further delay. The following morning, therefore, the rebel leaders were flown down to Ibn Saud's camp with Colonel Dickson, who personally handed them over to Ibn Saud, and the Chief Staff Officer left with Ibn Shiblan, and emissaries from Ibn Saud, bearing letters of forgiveness. &amp;c., for Jarishan, to tell the tribes to move south, while I returned that night in H.M.S. 'Lupin' to Bushire. 9. I would mention that, in accordance with your instructions, at my first interview with Ibn Saud I informed him that His Majesty's Government took great exception to the tone of the notes addressed by his Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Jedda. He admitted at' once that their remonstrance was justified, and expressed his regret, and it was reported to me afterwards that Ibn Saud had telegraphed for Fuad Hamza to come to his camp and intended to dismiss him and appoint Hafiz Wabha to act in his place temporarily. Now that the meeting with King Faisal is to take place, it is possible that he may decide not to make any change for the moment, and that if Fuad Hamza carries on the negotiations with Iraq successfully he may rehabilitate himself; Ibn Saud, however, was certainly very angry with him at the time. Curiously enough, Hafiz Wabha, who had been rather a nuisance to the political agent 'at Koweit for some time past, w T as most helpful during the negotiations; he is. I believe, on very bad terms with the King's private secretary, Yusif Yasin, a Syrian, who was most obstructive in every way. and possibly this had much to do with it. 10. I regret that I was unable to obtain the more definite assurances which His Majesty's Government desired regarding the exact measure of control to be imposed on the rebel leaders and the tribes. As explained in my telegram No. 38 of the 28th January, Ibn Saud resented dictation in this matter; he contended that he had given a definite promise to prevent raids, but that the exact manner in which he was to implement this must he left to him. To have pressed the point would have meant further discussions, and, as I have pointed out above, an early settlement was essential, and I could not help feeling that the matter was one rather of theoretical than of practical importance. Firstly, as regards the leaders, it would have been very difficult to have ascertained whether in fact they were being kept in Riyadh or at any other place. Secondly, as telegraphed in my comments on the agreement, if Ibn Saud means to stop raiding he may be trusted to exercise effective control over both the leaders and the tribes; if he does not intend to fulfil this undertaking, then any promises regarding the control to be exercised over the rebel tribes will certainly prove equally illusory. I think, however, that not merely in fulfilment of his under takings to His Majesty's Government, but in his own interests, he will take drastic measures to prevent all risk of a further rebellion against his authority. As regards the tribes it was not his intention to restrict them to one specified area; considerations of grazing and water would prevent this; but I think he intends to control their movements generally and not to allow them to move about anywhere they please, for some time to come at any rate. 11. As regards Ibn Saud's promises to settle claims promptly in future, my hands were somewhat tied by the machinery of the Bahra Agreement in the case of Iraq. Ibn Saud would, of course, have been glad of any excuse to modify the terms of the Bahra Agreement and expressed his readiness to settle claims for raids on Iraq on demand, but said that he assumed that any such arrangement would super sede any arrangement prescribed in the Bahra Agreement. To this, of course, I could not agree, and the only course possible was to try to tighten up the Bahra Agreement; and Ibn Saud offered spontaneously to appoint representatives to the tribunal prescribed in the Bahra Agreement at any time one month after the receipt of a request to this effect by the Iraq Government, the only stipulation he made being that the month of Zi-Haj (pilgrimage) should be excluded from the computation ofX . -V [\ If. 1 '• ' ■&lt;X- •• —L l' : : .

He contended, however, that the failure to form a tribunal to investigate claims in the past was not due to him and that he had, on two occasions, sent Hafiz Wabha to Koweit as his representative, and that the latter had stayed there for six months on one occasion and for two or three months on another, and that the Iraq Government had failed to send representatives. I did not know whether this statement was correct and told him that I knew nothing about the matter. As regards Koweit, the current practice for the settlement of claims is for the ruler of Koweit to address Ibn Sand direct and for claims to be adjusted by direct correspondence. This procedure has proved quite ineffectual in the past, and F doubt whether it is likely to prove much more effective in the future, but Ibn baud stated that he was quite willing to negotiate an agreement with Koweit on the lines of the Bahra Agreement should the sheikh desire it. Finally, he agreed to pay £10,000 in anticipation of a final settlement of account. ^ )e Se€n fi rs tly, the leaders have gone back of their own free will; secondly, we have obtained a promise from Tbn Saud that he will treat them and the tntesmen with humanity; thirdly, he has given a categorical promise to prevent any raids by Nejd tribes into Koweit or Iraq in the future and, should any raids occur despite his efforts, the machinery lor their settlement has been considerably tightened up, and if the Iraq Government choose to avail themselves of it no undue delay should occur in obtaining compensation. Finally, despite the fact that Ibn Saud contends that his claims against Iraq amount approximately to the same ngure as the Iraq claims against Nejd, a substantial sum has been obtained from him on account. 12. As regards the allocation as between Koweit and Iraq of the £10,000 I am confronted by a similar difficulty to that expressed by his Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq in his telegram No. 81 to you of the 31st January, inasmuch f *-£■ I as I do not know the amount of the Iraq claims, or the proportion they bear to the ' Koweit claims. I would, however, point out that Ibn Saud claims to have heavv counter-claims against Iraq, whereas he has not got any counter-claims against Koweit. In any case, the sum of £10,000 is only a payment on account and a final settlement is yet to come. I would suggest, therefore, that, subject to any views his Excellency the High Commissioner may express, £3,000 should be allotted to Koweit J and i/7,000 to Iraq, whose claims are presumably larger. 1/ . As regards the proposal for the conclusion with Koweit of an agreement similar to the Bahra Agreement, I consider it most desirable that some such agreement should be negotiated, not merely with a view to providing machinery for the rapid settlement oi claims, but with the object of emphasising the independent status ot the ruler of Koweit. I am addressing a separate despatch to the Govern ment oi India on this subject, and will here merely say that in my opinion it should be a cardinal point of our policy m the Gulf to uphold, maintain and emphasise in every possible way the independence of this small principality, surrounded as it is by two powerful neighbours, and one of the means to this end would be the negotiation of a formal treaty between Koweit and Nejd. I have therefore instructed the political agent to discuss»the matter with the sheikh and am examining annlT!w 10n ''I 8 ! 'J. f oun d that the provisions of the Bahra Agreement are u ui t I mutandls t0 Koweit with no material modifications then probably the simplest course would be for the Sheikh of Koweit to request His to negotiate such a treaty on his behalf, and presumably this eonld be done tnrongh Has Majesty's Minister at Jedda. Should any material modification be found necessary, then, doubtless, it will be possible in the near tuture to arrange a meeting between the sheikh and fbn Sand and, possibly if His Majesty s GoyernmeiU saw no objection, the political agent or I could also attend to discuss the matter. U. In the course of a private discussion with Ibn Saud, I mentioned the matter of Koweit customs, but the latter was entirely uncompromising; at the same ime, he was quite frank and said he was in dire straits for money (which I believe Sheiiw e K 0r le ' rect )' f ld t that he must get it from somewhere, and that the hheikh of Koweit had a comfortable income without having to work for it while he tbn -and, led laborious days and was constantly beset by financial worries This' ™tTT' r s » nd,culous argument, but time did not permit of my pressing this matter further then, nor was the moment altogether propitious. I do not Hiink however, that there is much use in continuing a discussion on paper with Ibn Sand on this subject. There are many wheels within wheels. For one thino- Ibn Saud'a chief financiers are the wealthy firm of Qusaibis at Bahrein.

The correspondence is between Harold Dickson, Political Agent in Kuwait, Hugh Biscoe, Political Resident in Bushire, Lord Passfield, Secretary of State for the Colonies in London, William Bond, Charge d'Affaires in Jeddah, Francis Humphrys, High Commissioner in Iraq, John Chancellor, High Commissioner in Palestine, Robert Brooke-Popham, Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, Arthur Henderson, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in London, the Government of India, Sheikh Ahmed al-Jabar al-Sabah, Sheikh of Kuwait, Ibn Sa'ud, King of Najd and the Hejaz, and Charles Prior, the Political Agent in Bahrain.The volume covers the unsettled period following the collapse of the Ikhwan rebellion against Ibn Sa'ud's rule when many rebel tribes sought sanctuary in Iraq and Kuwait. The documents discuss the whereabouts of some of the leaders (Faisal ad-Dawish, Naif al-Hithlain, ibn Mashhur, ibn Lami and ibn Shiblan) and their tribes (mainly Ajman and Mutair), and what to do with them should they surrender. The negotiations of their surrender and those to secure an agreed return to Najd is also discussed, the latter in some detail following meetings between the Political Resident and Ibn Sa'ud himself. Restitution of property lost during raids is also discussed and negotiated.The volume also covers a dialogue on the idea of a meeting between King Faisal of Iraq and Ibn Sa'ud.At the back (folios 286-87) are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ikhwan, military and religious brotherhood</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Palestine and Transjordan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Officer Commanding, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Iraq Fayṣal I</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Fayṣal bin Sulṭān al-Dawīsh</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Farḥān bin Mashhūr al-Sha'lān</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Nāyif bin Ḥithlayn</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>'Ajmān (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Muṭayr (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000234#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
