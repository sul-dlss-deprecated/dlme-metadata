There is a page of office notes after the correspondence (verso of folio 7), which mirrors the volume's chronological arrangement. Because the items in the volume have been bound upside down, the correspondence runs in reverse chronological order if moving through the volume from the front cover to back cover.</extent><extent>Orientation: The items in the volume have been bound upside down in relation to the file cover and title page.Foliation: The volume is foliated from the front cover to the inside back cover, using circled numbers in the top-right corner of each recto . There is an earlier foliation system which uses uncircled numbers. Because of the manner in which the volume has been bound, the earlier foliation system appears upside down, in the bottom-left corner of verso pages.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The correspondence in the volume relates to a request by the Hejaz Government to import 32,000 sacks of rice from Karachi via Bahrain, for use by the Hejaz army and government. Most of the items in the volume are telegrams sent between the British minister in Jeddah, the Political Agent in Bahrain, and the Political Resident in Bushire. Permission is granted to allow the import of rice from Karachi to the Hejaz via Bahrain, but it is stipulated by the Bahrain Political Agent (after consultation with the Advisor to Government) that transit dues on the rice will have to be paid.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00023e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
