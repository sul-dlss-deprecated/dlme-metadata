On the night of the 19 th and the next day, the greatest successes acre scored when thirty-seven aircraft were destroyed, A subsequent fourteen have been accounted for. Luring this time intensive raids on enemy bases in Libya, and on tanks and transport, have been making pulp of concentrations behind the lines. Enemy air fields have fallen intact into British hands; on one airfield nineteen planes, more or less airworthy, were found, Naples and Brindisi have been raided four times and huge fires started. On the 17th a convoy of merchant shipping was attacked, the enemy suffering direct hits on a medium sized merchant ship, which was set ablaze. At the end of the week the R,A,F., working in close co-operation with the Navy, torpedoed a cruiser, and bombed a large merchant ship and other Axis vessels, British aircraft losses amount to thirty-one planes. There has been no activity over Germany during the week, and exceptionally bad weather has confined the R.A.E. to daylight sweeps ever Northern France and heme waters. The most successful of these was on the 22nd, when six enemy fighter aircraft were shot dam, for the loss of only one of our planes. The docks at Boulogne have been bombed, and Brest was also raided. Factories, railway yards and aerodromes include targets attacked, Gn the 17th a large German supply ship was hit by two bombs, set ablaze, and left listing heavily. On the 11 th, a smaller ship was sunk off the Dutch coast; a 500-ton ship was sent to the bottom of the Channel on the 18th, A patrol vessel-was badly hit Joy canpon and machine-gun fire.

German activity over this country has been on a very small, scale during the week. Casualties and damage have been very slight, and during the day of the 16th two Gorman bembers were destroyed.IP ~ COPY - i t. a : /5405 19 41 C SSCBET Allotted to &amp; CodIss to ForeifEn Office.

Deports suggest that Italian heme morale hQS been considerably shaken. It is’thought here tnat Germany is bound to intervene to prevent .serious military disaster to her partner. Intervention would probably take the form of an advance through Bulgaria where many preparations have been made. Alchough there are no regular bodies of German troops in Bul aria many technicians are kfcown to be there in the guise of tourists andthe aerodromes ’have been improved. | There are probably 70,000 to 80,000 German troops in Koumarda vmich v/ould serve as a jumping'off groima. Bulgaria does not v/ant a German invasion which woidd comprcsaise lier owj^ independence but would probably not be able to resist. In any reference to Turkey emphasis should be laid oil' 1 her vital material interest in resisting the German advance, rather than-on ajuy pie ages- or general political reasons. .

Begins . Aims of German invasion of Norway and Denmark apparently were to secure economic resources, to obtain advanced naval and air bases for attacks on Britain and British shipping and to control iron ore route via Narvik., Swift Allied action has partly frustrated first of these aims, largely frustrated second and entirely frustrated third. As regards tactics of invasion, Germans undoubtedly hoped by surprise attack to secure sufficient control of whole coast to prevent Allied landings, secondly to command the internal lines of communication, and thirdly to take up positions on the Swedish frontier and thus be able to paralyse Sweden by simultaneous pressure by land and sea 0 These objectives they have failed to attain. One result has been to make certain that Sweden will resist any attack,, Neutral and unofficial reports of Norwegian fighting should be treated with great reserve. Since enemy is unaware of exact nature of Allied forces, dispositions and movements, official bulletins cannot tell whole story. Substantial and well-equipped Allied forces have been landed, have made contact with Norwegian forces north of Oslo, and occupy valuable strategic positions from which it would have been difficult to dislodge Germans if action had been delayed, but consolidation of these positions and advance against main German forces cannot be accomplished at once. Local conditions of weather and terrain inevitably hamper progress and immediate results are not to be expected, nor can success be unqualified. Undue optimism should be discouraged. It is not yet possible to say what part air power will play in the operations. The Germans undoubtedly have the local advantage in this arm, as their first landings secured them control of Norway’s few principalairports and they are relatively near to home bases in North Germany and Denmarkrt Hence our unremitting attacks on air bases at Stavanger, Oslo, Aalborg and Sylt are of greatest importance in connection with land warfare in Norway« Too much should not be made of Allied minefields and. other interference with German transport in Baltic, the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, But transport of the Allied expeditionary force without loss contrasts with serious German losses even in narrow waters between Denmark and south Norway, and testifies to complete command of the North Sea, This should prevent large-scale reinforcements or supplies s ^ a to German forces in western Norway, Important to note that, apart from the local, situation at sea, the destruction o German warships pro tanto releases Allied ships for service in other waters in case the war should spread, although the German losses in capital ships known for certain to have been incurred are not as large as has been sometimes reported. It is doubtful for instance whether Gneisenau was sunk, Italian attitude is unsatisfactory, but important Fascist leaders are known to be opposed to entering war and anti- Italian publicity should be avoided.

Moreover since 1931 great advance mechanisation e.g. less than half number horses compared 1916 whereas half a million tractors acquired. Fuel therefore now necessity for Russian agriculture, and total oil exports 1958 only amounted 1.2 million tons. Moreover Russia now herself engaged war and no indication Stalin feels welfare Germany matter life death Russia. Finally transport difficulties e.g. Baltic frozen part year and vast distance oilfields from Baltic ports. Difficulties Danubian route and shortage tank wagons Germany see earlier telegrams.

In 1914 most British sugar supplies came from Suropean enemy countries and offcut by war.

'''lex/-* INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W.l. 18th December, 1939. Thank you for your letter of the 2nd December No. 0/829 enclosing a copy of a letter from Weightman dated 26th November, No. C/772-1.a/50, regarding delays etc., in the receipt of publicity material. I have made some enquiries with the following result. The telegram K. 3034 dated 25th November, to which Weightman refers, was a copy, issued by the Naval Intelligence Division of the Admiralty, of a signal transmitted on the night of the 23rd November to Ministers and British representatives in those countries where there is no naval representative. The Admiralty are in the habit of sending us copies of these signals so that we can telegraph them to India, Burma etc. They appear once or t?/ice a week. The one in quesuion was despatched to us from the Admiralty on 24th November and reached here the next day, which, as you see, was the date of its transmission to Bahrein. The purpose of these Admiralty telegrams, and one might almost say of all the Ministry of Information Publicity telegrams uoo, is not to convey hot news but to provide a brief review of the naval situation during the past week or so. That is to say the publicity telegrams do not supply factual news for its own sake but collect a certain series of facts, v/hich may be quite old, and put some intelligent interpretation upon them — a service that no news agency undertakes. You might like to pass this on to Weightman. The Hon'hle Lieut. Col. C.G. Prior, CIE. , R. PEEL..

I now find that even the tele grams that are sent to me are out of date. I enclose one which I have received this morning and which was sent off from London during the night. (It is not of the least use to me). Since Heuters yesterday mentioned that sinkings in just over a week have risen to thirty, it is not much use telling me that up to the 2lst there had only been sixteen including neutrals. There is no mention of our so-called ♦♦reprisals* in intercepting German exports in neutral ships; and frankly I am unable to puzzle out a reason for sending me a telegram on the 26th about the situation as it stood on the 2lst, when everybody who has a wireless, or knows someone who has a wireless, is aware that there have been major developments since. 2. 1 should have thought too that it would have been worth while sending out some publicity stuff about the Belgo-Dutch peace proposals.

Information to H*Mo : s Representatives abroad, dated 25th November, Following for guidance and possible use as talking points:- lo Further unimpeachable evidence that the recent losses of British and neutral merchant ships off the East Coast of England have been due to German mines purposely laid in order to inflict losses upon neutrals and non-combatants is provided by the testimony of the captain of the Japanese liner TERUKUNI MARtk which was sunk by a mine off the British East coast* The mast of the ship states positively that his ship was not struck by a floating mine which had broken adrift from its moorings. It was broad daylight and the visibility was good. He had five look-outs posted. Moreover the explosion was not at the side of the vessel, but underneath it, so that it lifted the ship and threw men off their feet* The nearest British mined area is 35 miles away from the position in which the TERUKuTTI iviARU was sunk. In any case, British mines automatically become safe if. they breed: away from their moorings* The TERUKUNI M.ARU had visited a British contrabend control station from which she had been cleared in the short time of 5 hours. She had a British pilot on board of whose conduct the Japanese captain expressed himself in the warmest terms, saying that the pilot had remained on the bridge with him and had been reluctant to leave the ship even when ordered to do so by the captain* 2, l'bat there was no loss of life on this occasion was due to a combination of several circumstances. The ship was mined in broad daylight. The weather was calm* The certain gave the order to lower the lifeboats in good time. If he had waited, it would probably have been imjjossible to lower the port boats, since 40 minutes after the explosion the ship took a heavy list to starboard before sinking. Moreover there were in the vicinity several British auxiliary craft and these played a most important part in the rescue of the passengers and crew* The greatest indignation is shown by Japanese and other neutral shipping companies at the illegal and wanton mining by Germany of shipping channels with the obvious intention of inflicting loss upon, and intimidating, merchant shipping, irrespective of its nationality or the dictates of humanity*\\&amp; Telephone No. EUSton 6030. lfrw/ma © f t* yt.

C cGERMANY AND THE ARAB WORLD Oerinan political *£rns # past and present, in the Near and Diddle East, are well-known to lost Arab readers. :.oro than 40years a^o, under the old Imperial Germany, the object of that Government was to spread German influence through Turkey and the Arab lands then under Turkish rule. The Bagdad Rail a. , projected but never completed, was largely financed by Gorman funds. Germans wore encouraged to found settlements of Colonies in Palestine. German arch aeologists, nominally engaged in excavation, spread propaganda in Iraq by insidious means. The Kaiser himself - the Croat War Lord - paid visits to Syria and Palestine, proclaiming himself at Damascus the Protector of Islam and the Successor of Salah el Din, and at Jerusalem a few days later the Protector of the Christian Church and the Successor of the Crusadorc. In duo course, German advisors to the Turkish A*my were appointed by the Turkish Gov rnmenfc in Constantinople, and by 1914 German influence in Turkey had become so strong that the latter felt bound to follow Germany^ lead in the Great Var. There is no doubt that had Germany boon victorious, she would have made Turkey pay hor price by giving her a con trolling influence In her Eastern Empire. Certainly there would have boon no question of liberating the Arab states. T eoe would have exchanged Turkish for German domination. In illustration of this contention, it is interesting to find the following passage in a book recently published entitled 'Economic Recovery and Industrialization of New Turkey' and written by Orhan Conker and Emile Y/itmeur (pp.49-50):-And wo now know only too well what German domination .leans* The characteristic of German rule is force* The force of Imperial Germany and the force of kazi Germany is funda mentally the same* It means blind obedience to orders, suppression of liberty of thought and s;eec; , ruthless punish ment of those who disobey* Fortunately for the world and for the Arab countries no less than foi’ Huro e, the War of 1914-18 was won by the Allies and not by Germany* And though no doubt mistakes were made by Great Britain and her allies both during and after the War, It can nevertheless be stated w't out any question that the Arabic speaking world is in a far better position today than she would have been after a German victory* an- Iraq are independent states and members of he League of hatlono* Both these countries are ruled by Kings whose father and grandfather respectively were close friends of England in pence am war, who, with their governments happily continue that friendship* Both countries are allied to Groat Britain by treaty, anu both have spontaneously proclaimed their defceimiination to sap; ort Great Britain in her resent conflict with Germany* The differences with Great Britain which once existed in these countries are happily healed and belong to past history. Both know they owe mch to their heatern Aliy, while Great Iritain equally knows she owes much to them. A believer In freedom herself, she as assisted Egypt and -^raq to attain freedom for the.^selves, and as believers in the democratic ideal they have ^roclai .©d themselves on the side of the democracies• Syria and the Lebanon, under French tutelage, have made great economic and cultural progress since 1918, and the nuclei of self-governin institution:; have been sot up. The peoples of the Lebanon and of Syria havo. In the present crisis, expressed their unanimous support of France and Britain, thereby showin clearly that they are fully conscious of the : ate that would await tl em under kuzi rule, and of the complete identityof interests that binds them to the de .ocracics (d(3) Another gre?,t Arab Sfate, Saudi-Arabia, ruled today by a wise and far-seeing states lan, is playing an important role In the world. His Majesty, King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud has shown himself on numerous occasions a friend of Great rltain; his sons too are well-known in England, where they have many contacts, -^-t nay be recalled that the Amir Peisal played a conspicuous part in the conferences which took place 'n London in the early part of the year on thePalostine question, where he displayed a discerning sense of statesmanship, and favourably impressed all with whom he came in contact. A smaller, but nevertheless important, state, that of Trans Jordan, r^led like Iraq by a member of the Hash!mite dynasty has recently acquired a greater control over her own affairs. Tho Amir Abdullah has visited England on several occasions, where ho Is deservedly popular, he as spoken, since the outbreak of war, with no uncertain voice, expressing his fin^onviction that world peace can never be assured until Nazism is crushed. In the IeraIan Gulf, the Shaikhs of the Truclal Coast, of bahroin and of Kowolt, and the Sultan of Unseat are in treaty relations with Great Britain; while in Southern Arabia, the Shaikhs of the Hadramaut are independent rulers in close alliance with and un er the protection of the same Power. The ieoplos in such states as these have proclaimed $£ontanoously and unanimously their support for Great Britain Ijft £he present strug 0 le with Germany. Perhaps in no other Country of the iddle East, Las this been so striking as in Palestine. Here the Arabs have agreed to postpone their differences with the Government over the Jewish question, and the Jews have done the saoe. 7*hlle this does rbt necessarily imply that eitiier party is satisfied with the policy laid down in the *&lt;hite Paper, the fact remains that, whether toy5 . 03 agree or not on the policy of His Majesty^ Government, as regards the future of Palestine, they do agree that, until t .e war is successfully over, they will declare a truce,and will both lend their support to Great Britain in her prose cution of the War. In short, while agreeing to differ over their respective demands in Mestine, they are in complete accord with Great Britain in her determination to fight Nazism-and to put an end once and for all to the doctrine of rule by Force. tthat is the reason for this astonishing accord between the peoples of the Ara ) world on the question of the European War? Why have they all set aside for the time being their own difficulties - for every state in the world has its own difficulties and problems in time of war even more than In time of peace - devoted themselves to a declaration of support of Great Britain and France in her fight against Hitlerism? Why has the Arab press spoken with one voice on the side of the Democracies and against the doctrines of Nazism? The answer is that the Arab people believe in freedom, and they know that the Democracies are fighting not for their own ends but for the freedom of the world. The British Prime Minister has stated that his country and France are not fighting the German people but the present German Government. Hitler wants to rule Europe, and not only Europe but the world. The Arabs realize that Nazism if extended to their countries would mean an end to their independence, an end to liberty of thought and speech, an end to all that free peoples hold most dear. The world knows today that Hitler »s repeated assertion that he wanted only Germans in the Reich hfcs been falsified by the rape first of Czecho-Slovakia ahd then of r olsnd. An., it knows too what Hitlerism means to those who try ro resist it as In ioland, where the c untry has been laid waste, where open cities have been bmombed, and where thousands of women and ch r Idren have be~n anon,~ the victims^■I 6 . Kqually it kn jws whf;t .'. r i tlei’laia :neans to those who try to escape fro..: it, as in Czechoslovakia, w! are the ruthless suppression ay execution and imprisonment of many citizens has recently ti ken place, iwer© is no doubt that the German Government was afraid that, in the event of a war, the Arab nations might side with Great Britain and Franco rather than with Ger:.»ny. It was for this reason that^he made use of wides road propa ganda. This took the form partly of broadcasts in Arabic from aerman stations, partly of books and parnphletfin Arabic designed to prove that Germany and not Great Britain was the friend of the Arabs. The Arabs listened to the broadcasts and read the books. Gut they tore not deceived. They knew that Hitler had broken his word so often in 2uro,e that whatever he said was not to be trusted. And when they read the Arabic trans lation of ein Ka. pf', a translation specially prepared for Arab readers, and omitting certain passages which would have been offensive to Arab feeling, their eyes were opened to too doctrine o'' Force which has always boon Hitler's principle. 'Might is Right' is the motto underlying 'f,.ein Kampf', and has been used by Hitler in subduing Austria, Czechoslovakia, and now xoland. There is no doubt that Hitler would Hie to extend it to the East as well as to the West. And tills fact has been realized by the Arab world. WlHin a few days of the outbreak of war, the Arabs spoke with one voice: 'Hitlerism must be destroyed'* @) Circulation: Infn.Offr 0 2033/1959 FoSo to U Mr 0 Crombie Mr 0 Gibaon Burma Office J.

May be useful to counter exaggerated or alarmist statements regarding effect mine laying campaign. Aeroplane can only carry ^ '.ry limited number of mines is more easily detected than submarine and involves extravagant use petrol. Submarine cannot return same spot without risk of loss since she never certain whether or not original mine field swept. Moreover submarines far more vulnerable than aircraft as proved by he \vy losses since war began. It is because these losses that Germany prefers employ sub:: nines easier indiscriminate illegal action lay'ng mines rather than using torpedoes gunfire aimed at particular objectives. Large number mines washed up Yorkshire coast gives indication difficulties expense keeping minefield efficient intact over considerable period, German propaganda itself after admitting fairly openly German responsibility gives signs awaiting neutral reactions doubtless realising emphasis mine laying activities will alienate neutral feelings. Attitude neutrals may therefore be considerable importance for which reason Germany doubtless imputed falsely to Denmark Yugoslavia and Argentine amongst others intention abandoning British trade. past experience serves show similar campaigns aimed curtailing natural flow international trade exceedingly costly to attackers must be sustained continually over large area and long period and eventually fail'their purpose.

German mines, laid without any notification, have accounted for at least 140 of these. During the same period no neutral lives have been lost due to activities of any British warship, submarine or mine. Since mid-October it has been a common occurrence for British and Neutral Merchant Ships to be sunk by German ships without any warning. The following have been sunk by action of enemy submarines during the four days ending 21st November. Three British Trawlers, combined tonnage 855, and two other British ships, combined tonnage 5609. Also the following have been sunk by enemy mines. Four small British ships, combined tonnage 6-J- thousand tons, one French ship of 2921 tons, and six neutral merchant ships, Dutch, Yugo-Slav, Swedish, Japanese, Italian, Lithuanian, combined tonnage 35,000 tons. During the same four days, 5 enemy merchant ships totalling 18,000 tons have been lost by the 1 enemy. Of these 2 totalling 9,000 tons scuttled themselves when threatened with capture, and the other three also totalling about 9,000 tons were brought in as prize.♦ n ? r?i ^ o “7 / 430 ! yJf Circulation:- r\ PoS* to U.S.S.

UUIU, L vents moved with such rapidity during the last fortnight’of my mission to Berlin that it proved impossible at the time to livt any consecutive account of them. If I have the honour to do so now while the facts are still fresh in my memory, it is with the hope that such an account may be both of immediate interest to your Lordshin and serve a purpose from the point of view of historical accuracy. 2. Nevertheless, it is not these last minute manoeuvres which have the real importance, except in so far as they confirm the pnnciples and demonstrate the methods and technique of Herr Hitler and of Nazism. A brief description of the background to August 1939 is consequently indispensable, if the events of the last few weeks aie to be visualised in their proper perspective. i f 3 ’* f IeiT an d National Socialism are the products of the defeat of a great nation in war and its reaction against the confusion and distress which followed that defeat. National Socialism itself is a revolution and a conception of national philosophy. Contrary to service™!)! the subordi -‘ion of 'the 7 State toVe service of its citizens, Nazism prescribes the subordination of its utizens to the service of the State, an all embracing Moloch, and to the individual who rules that State. 4. So Jong as National Socialism remained an article for internal th r ° Ut8lde W ° rld ’ accordin g to individual predilec tion, might criticise or sympathise or merely watch with anxiety. Jt^w^r'n WaS the affair of the German People. hevnnd r Untl &gt; f 16 th f ory of German nationalism was extended the limits^ompatibIe'with°peac™ ‘ hat the Phil ° SOphy eXCeeded 5. It would be idle to deny the great achievements of the man who restored to the German nation its self-respect and its disciplined riness. T] e tyiannical methods which were employed within ermam, i self to obtain this result were detestable, but were ermarry s own concern. Many of Herr Hitler’s social reforms, in spite of their complete disregard of personal liberty of thought, word oi deed, were on highly advanced democratic lines. The “ Strength iroug o\ movement, the care for the physical fitness of the , . 10 ,fvf n ’tt- ? Ve a ’ or g an ’ sa i ; inn of the labour camps, an idea ic ieir i er once told me that he had borrowed from Bulgaria.are typical examples of a benevolent dictatorship. Nor can the appeal ol Nazism with its slogans so attractive to a not over-discerning youth be ignored Much of its legislation in this respect will survive in a newer and better world, in which Germany’s amazing power of organisation and the great contributions which she has made in the ^ past to the sciences, music, literature and the higher aims of civilisation and humanity will again play a leading part. idpnt li 0 ) Yi the imit y ° f Great Germany in itself an ignoble ofrw J fc ?v d i° ng beer ! ? he dream of some of the highest-minded man thinkers, and it must be remembered that even in 1914 mtprnipf W m- 8tl i ! mmatu f as a Political concept.

Aumist ]t may ’. the background to the events of vpar ft ! 939 u th f occu P atlon of Prague on the 15th March of this lihprtv ° US de . st ™ ctl °n thereby of the hard and newly-won liberty of a free and independent people and Herr Hitler’s deliberate ^lolahon by this act of the Munich Agreement which he had signed not qmte six months before. In 1939, as in 1914, the origin of war ^ it i Geimany has been due to the deliberate tearing up by the latter of a scrap of paper. To the iniquities of a system which employed the .barbarism of the middle ages in its persecution of the Jews, which subjected Roman Catholic priests and Protestant pastors alike to the inhumanities of the concentration camp for obedience to their religious faith and which crushed out, in a fashion unparalleled in history, all individual liberty within the State itself, was added the olo Tlw on A v .°! international agreements freely negotiated, but also of that principle of self-determination which Herr Hitler had [20104]! B 24 invoked with such insistence so long as it suited his own purpose to do so. Up to last March the German ship of State had flown the German national flag, and in spite of the sickening technique of Nazism it was difficult not to concede to Germany the right both to control her own destiny and to benefit from those principles which were accorded to others. On the 15th March, by the ruthless suppres- ^ sion of the freedom of the Czechs, its captain hoisted the skull and crossbones of the pirate, cynically discarded his own theory of racial purity and appeared under his true colours as an unprincipled menace to European peace and liberty. 9. Two of the less attractive characteristics of the German are his inability either to see any side of a question except his o wn &gt; or to understand the meaning of moderation. It would ha\e been understandable to argue that a hostile Bohemia in the centre of Germany was an untenable proposition. But Herr Hitler could see no mean between rendering the Czechs innocuous as a potential enemy and destroying their liberty as an independent people. There is some surprising reason to believe that Herr Hitler himself was disagreeably and literally astonished at the reaction in Britain and the world generally, which was provoked by the occupation of Prague and his breach of faith with Mr. Chamberlain. But while he may have realised his tactical mistake, it did not deter him from prosecuting his further designs. 10. As I had reported to your Lordship, at the beginning of the year Germany’s immediate objectives, apart from the complete political and economic domination of Czecho-Slovakia and the eventual restoration of German colonies, were Danzig and Memel. Herr Hitler felt that it would not add much to the general execration of his aggression and ill-faith in March if he settled these two problems simultaneously with Prague. The Democracies were, he thought, so averse to war that they would accept any fait accompli. They would be less disturbed if everything was done at once. Thereafter, the agitation would, he anticipated, gradually subside until, after consolidating his gains, he was once more in a position to strike again. 11. With this plan in view the Lithuanian Government was at once browbeaten into surrendering Memel. The same method was employed at Warsaw, but the Poles were made of sterner stuff. Negotiations had been proceeding ever since Munich for a settlement of the Danzig and the Corridor question. After Prague Herr Hitler decided that they must be abruptly concluded, and Herr von Bibbentrop peremptorily dictated to the Polish Ambassador the terms which Herr Hitler would be pleased to impose on the Polish Government. The reply of the latter was given on the 26th March and constituted a refusal to accept a Dictate, while expressing readiness to continue free and equal discussion. Alarmed at the threatening attitude adopted by the German Government inconsequence of this refusal, the Polish Government mobilised part of its forces (the German army was already largely mobilised), and the British guarantee to Poland was given on the 31st March. 12. The Ides of March constituted in fact the parting of the r ways and were directly responsible for everything which happened thereafter. Thenceforward no small nation in Europe could feel itself secure from some new adaptation of Nazi racial superiority and jungle law. The Polish guarantee was followed by unilateral guarantees on Britain’s part to Greece and Boumania as well as by an attempt on the part of the British and French Governments to induce the U.S.S.R. to join in a peace front against aggression, ill-faith and oppression. The Nazi Government, for its part and with considerable success in Germany, represented this attempt as a renewal of the alleged pre-war British policy of encirclement. As a war-cry for the German people it was exceedingly effective up to the signature of the Russo-German non-aggression pact on the 28rd August. The rest of Nazi propaganda was on two entirely contradictory lines either of which was destined, according to the development of the situation, to serve Herr Hitler’s purpose. The first spread the persistent report that Britain would never go to war for the sake of Danzig. It was calculated to undermine the confidence of the Poles and to shake the faith of the smaller Powers, as well as of the United States of America, in the determination of Britain to resist any further German aggression. The second represented Britain as resolved to make war at the first opportunity on Germany in any case and in order to crush her before she became a too formidable political and economic rival. Both were fallacies but the Germans are a credulous race and, since the first has failed, it is the latter argumentation which forms the basis of Germany’s present war propaganda. 13. Up to the beginning of August, though the clouds were black and the peace front negotiations dragged on interminably, the situation remained serious but not immediately dangerous. Instead, however, of there being any sign of a relaxation of tension at Danzig the position there had gradually become more and more strained. From the end of March till the end of August all personal contact between Warsaw and Berlin was suspended. The remilitarisation of the Free City, alleged by the Germans to be purely defensive, but no less adaptable for offensive purposes, had proceeded apace, and other measures had been taken indicative of a German intention to effect a sudden coup there. The Poles for their part, in view of the great increase in arms smuggling, had been obliged to strengthen their customs inspectors by a number of frontier guards. They had also taken certain economic counter-measures of a nature to prejudice the trade of the Free City. 14. What was, however, even more ominous were the extensive preparations which were being made by the Germans for thei '—V 6 twenty-fifth celebration of the battle of Tannenberg on the 27th August, and a German warship was scheduled to visit Danzig at the same time and ostensibly for the same purpose. Early in July I drew your Lordship’s attention to the menace involved by these equivocal preparations, which corresponded so closely to Hitler’s usual technique of preparing for all eventualities, undeiv cover of a plausible excuse. 15. The first mutterings of the storm were heard on the 4th August. At four posts on the Danzig-East Prussian frontier, the Polish Customs Inspectors were informed that they would not be permitted henceforward to carry out their duties. Alarmed at the gradual sapping of Polish rights and interests in the Free City, the Polish Commissioner General there was at once instructed to deliver a note to the Danzig Senate, warning the latter that the Polish Government would react in the strongest manner if the work of the inspectors was interfered with. The Senate subsequently denied that it had issued any instructions to the effect alleged but the German Government replied to what it described as the Polish ultimatum by a verbal note, which was handed by the State Secretary to the Polish Charge d’Affaires at Berlin on the 9th August. The Polish Government was therein warned that any further demand addressed to the Free City in the nature of an ultimatum or containing threats of reprisals, would at once lead to an aggravation of Polish-German relations, the responsibility for which would fall on the Polish Government. The latter retorted on the following day by a similar verbal note, denying the judicial right of Germany to intervene in the affairs between Poland and the Free City, and warning in its turn the German Government that ‘ ‘ any future intervention by the latter to the detriment of Polish rights and interests at Danzig would be considered as an act of aggression.” 16. I have little doubt but that the latter phrase served more than anything else to produce that final brainstorm in Herr Hitler’s mind on which the peace of the world depended, and upon which it always must have depended so long as the fate not only of Germany put also of Europe, rested in the hands of a single irresponsible individual. 17. The tragedy of any dictator is that as he goes on, his entourage steadily and inexorably deteriorates. For lack of freedom of utterance he loses the services of the best men. All opposition becomes intolerable to him. All those, therefore, who are bold enough to express opinions contrary to his views are shed one by one, and he is in the end surrounded by mere yes-men, whose flattery and counsels are alone endurable to him. In my report on the events of 1938 I drew your Lordship’s special attention to the far reaching and unfortunate results of the Blomberg marriage. I am more than ever convinced of the major disaster which that—in itself—minor incident involved, owing to the consequent elimination from7 Herr Hitler’s entourage of the more moderate and independent of his advisers, such as Field Marshal von Blomberg himself, Baron von Neurath, Generals Fritsch, Beck, &amp;c. After February of last year Herr Hitler became more and more shut off from external influences and a law unto himself. ■v 18. People are apt, in my opinion, to exaggerate the malign influence of Herr von Ribbentrop, Dr. Goebbels, Herr Himmler and the rest. It was probably consistently sinister, not because of its suggestiveness (since Herr Hitler alone decided policy), nor because it merely applauded and encouraged, but because, if Herr Hitler appeared to hesitate, the extremists of the party at once proceeded to fabricate situations calculated to drive Herr Hitler into courses which even he at times shrank from risking. The simplest method of doing this was through the medium of a controlled Press. Thus what happened in September last year, was repeated in March this year, and again in August. Dr. Goebbels’ propaganda machine was the ready tool of these extremists, who were afraid lest Herr Hitler should move too slowly in the prosecution of his own ultimate designs. 19. The 1988 stories of Czech atrocities against its German minority, were rehashed up almost verbatim in regard to the Poles. Some foundation there must necessarily have been for a proportion of these allegations in view of the state of excitable tension which existed between the two peoples. Excess of zeal on the part of individuals and minor officials there undoubtedly was—but the tales of ill-treatment, expropriation and murder were multiplied a hundredfold. How far Herr Hitler himself believed in the truth of these tales must be a matter for conjecture. Germans are prone in any case to convince themselves very readily of anything which they wish to believe. Certainly he behaved as if he did 'believe, and, even if one may give him the benefit of the doubt, these reports served to inflame his resentment to the pitch which he or his extremists desired. 20. Until the 8th August the campaign against the Poles had been relegated to the more discreet pages of the German press. Up to that date, public enemy No. 1 had been Great Britain and the alleged policy of encirclement. From that date, however, the stories of Polish atrocities began to take the leading place, and by the 17th August the campaign was in full swing. 21. Herr Hitler is a master of turning events to suit his own purpose, and the so-called ultimatum to the Danzig Senate of the 4th August and the subsequent foreign press comments on a Danzig climb down gave him the opportunity which he was seeking. The Polish note of the 4th August provided an excuse for the German note verbale of the 9th August, which provoked in its turn the Polish reply of the 10th August. In the midst of these exchanges Dr. Burckhardt, High Commissioner of the League of Nations for Danzig flew to Berchtesgaden in a last effort to place the position at [20104] tj oDanzig on a more satisfactory footing. He saw Herr Hitler on the 11th August, while Count Ciano and Herr von Eibbentrop were meeting at Salzburg. 22. Intransigent as he appears to have been at his interview with Dr. Burckhardt, there is little doubt in my mind that Herr Hitler would have been far more so had he at the time been iM possession of the text of the final paragraph of the Polish reply of 10th August, which had only been communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Berlin on that day. He was aware of it, however, when Count Ciano visited him at Berchtesgaden immediately after Dr. Burckhardt’s departure, and it undoubtedly rendered unavailing the Italian Foreign Minister’s laudable intention of pouring oil on the troubled waters. Once again, as in 1938, the inexorable fatality of the Greek tragedy was in evidence, and the coincidence of the Polish note of the 10th August with the Ciano visit was a striking example of it. Count Ciano returned to Italy and a day or so later the Italian Ambassador at Berlin was hurriedly summoned to Rome. 23. Herr Hitler’s carefully calculated patience was, in fact, exhausted, and on the 18th August I telegraphed to your Lordship that I had come to the definite conclusion that, if peace was to be preserved, the present situation could not be allowed to continue and that the only alternative to war must be some immediate and mediatory action. In this connexion I repeated a suggestion which I had made some time previously, namely, that a personal letter should be addressed by the Prime Minister to Herr Hitler and be delivered by some emissary from London. Two days later I again telegraphed to the same effect, and stated my conviction that Heir Hitlei had now finally decided upon some form of immediate action which would force the issue. I drew attention at the same time to the increased German military strength which had been assembled in East Prussia under cover of the Tannenberg anniversary and expressed my apprehension lest that celebration might prove the starting point for the action which Herr Hitler con templated. I have little doubt but that such was Herr Hitler’s original and premeditated intention. 24. On the 21st August information reached me that the long expected but carefully concealed German military concentrations were ahead} in pi ogress, and that instructions had been given to complete them by the 24th August. A report which reached me at that time actually mentioned the 25th August as the date fixed for the German advance into Poland. 25. I shall return to this point later, but I must here refer to the bombshell which was exploded late in the evening of the 21st August by the announcement that negotiations had been concluded for the signature of a Russo-German non-aggression pact and that Herr von Ribbentrop would fly to Moscow on the 23rd to sign it.9 26. The secret, which on the German side had been known to not more than a few persons, had been well kept. It had been realised that German counter-negotiations had been proceeding throughout the summer, but it was hoped that they had been abandoned after the actual arrival at Moscow of the French and ^(British military missions. Comment on the subject is, however, out side the scope of this report, except in so far as it concerns the effect of this announcement on the German public. The first impression in Berlin was one of immense relief, partly at the removal of the dreaded Russian air menace, but more particularly because, in the minds of a public which had been led to believe by Goebbels pro paganda that the British negotiations with the U.S.S.R. were really encirclement with a view to a preventive war, the conclusion of a Russo-German non-aggression pact meant that peace was assured, since Britain would not, it was told, fight for Danzig or Poland without Russian aid. Once more the faith of the German people in the ability of Herr Hitler to obtain his objective without war was reaffirmed. Its satisfaction was, however, short-lived and the deception consider able when it was realised that Britain’s word to Poland did not depend on Russian support. Those who had fought the war of nazism against communism were furthermore puzzled by this complete volte-face. The Nazi theory of racial purity had been discarded in March and in August a second of its basic principles was thus equally relegated to the scrap-heap. To most Germans the old hereditary enemy is Russia, nor was their confidence in the sincerity of her good intentions towards Germany greatly fortified by this exhibition of Russian ill-faith towards the Western Democracies. Nevertheless, as a diplomatic coup, the Russo-German pact was a strikingly success ful and surprising one. It is devoutly to be hoped that it may prove as Pyrrhic as are most diplomatic victories. 27. At the moment when Herr von Ribbentrop was preparing to fly to Moscow, I received shortly before 9 p.m. on the 22nd August your Lordship’s instructions to convey without delay a personal letter from the Prime Minister to Herr Hitler. I at once got into communication with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and in the course of the night an interview was arranged for the following day. I left Berlin at 9 • 80 on the morning of the 23rd August accompanied by the State Secretary and Herr Hewel, in an aeroplane provided for me by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 28. I reached Salzburg about midday and I had my first audience with Herr Hitler at Berchtesgaden at l p.m. on the 23rd August in the presence of Baron von Weizsacker and Herr Hewel. The correspondence, including the text of the Prime Minister’s letter, of Herr Hitler’s reply and my own telegraphic record of my two conversations with the Chancellor, is to be found in the Blue Book presented to Parliament and publishing the documents concerning German-Polish relations and the outbreak of hostilities between Great Britain and Germany on the 3rd September, 1939.f 1 ) O See Cmd. 6106, Nos. 56, 57, 58, 60. B 4 [20104]10 29. I need not say more here than that the three main points of the Prime Minister’s letter were (1) insistence on the determina tion of His Majesty’s Government to fulfil their obligations to Poland; (2) their readiness, if a peace atmosphere could be created, to discuss all the problems at issue between our two countries, and (3) their anxiety, during a period of truce, to see immediate direct discussion initiated between Germany and Poland in regard to the reciprocal^ treatment of minorities. 30. In Herr Hitler’s reply of the 23rd August he declared that Great Britain’s determination to support Poland could not modify his policy as expressed in the German verbal note to the Polish Government of the 9th August that he was prepared to accept even a long war rather than sacrifice German national interests and honour, and that, if Great Britain persisted in her own measures of mobilisation, he would at once order the mobilisation of the whole of the German forces. 31. At my first interview with him on that day, Herr Hitler was in a mood of extreme excitability. His language as regards the Poles and British responsibility for the Polish attitude was violent, recriminatory and exaggerated. He referred, for instance, to 100,000 German refugees from Poland, a figure which was at least five times greater than the reality. Again I cannot say whether he was persuaded or persuaded himself of the reality of these figures. At my second interview, when he handed me his reply, he had recovered his calm but was not less uncompromising. No longer, he told me, did he trust Mr. Chamberlain. He preferred war, he said, when he was 50 to when he was 55 or 60. He had himself always sought and believed in the possibility of friendship with England/ He now realised, he said, that those who had argued the contrary had been right and nothing short of a complete change in British policy towards Germany could ever convince him of any sincere British desire for good relations. My last remark to him was that I could only deduce from his language that my mission to Germany had failed and that I bitterly regretted it. 32. I flew back from Berchtesgaden to Berlin the same evening. I had m fact little hope that either the Prime Minister’s letter or my own language to Herr Hitler, however direct and straightforward would give him pause. The Russian pact had, I felt, created in his opinion a situation which was favourable to his designs and I believed his mind to be definitely made up. Though he spoke of his artistic tastes and of his longing to satisfy them, I derived the impression that the corporal of the last war was even more anxious to prove what he could do as a conquering Generalissimo in the next. 83. Nevertheless the visit to Berchtesgaden may after all have postponed the disaster for a week. Herr von Ribbentrop flew back to Germany with the signed Russo-German Agreement and Herr11 2 ) Idem No. 68. Hitler returned to Berlin the night of the 24th August. I have some reason to believe—though I cannot confirm it—that the order for the German Army to advance into Poland was actually issued for the night of the 25th-26th August. It is difficult otherwise to find justification for the various orders and arrangements which came ^^into force on the 26th and 27th August. In the afternoon of the 25th August itself all telephone communication between Berlin and London and Paris was unexpectedly cut off for several hours. The celebrations at Tannenberg were cancelled on the 26th and the Party Rally at Nuremberg on the 27th August; all Naval, Military and Air Attaches at Berlin were refused permission to leave the city without prior authority being obtained from the Ministry of War. All German airports were closed from that date, and the whole of Germany became a prohibited zone for all aircraft except the regular civil lines. All internal German air services were also suspended. Moreover as from the 27th a system for the rationing of food-stuffs and other commodities throughout Germany came into force. That this latter and—for the public—depressing measure should have been adopted prior to the outbreak of war can scarcely be explained, except on the assumption that war should actually have broken out on the 26th August. 34. The fact may well be, as I imagine it was, that Herr Hitler had had in consequence of the Prime Minister’s letter one last hesitation and countermanded the orders to his Army, whereas the other arrangements were allowed to proceed unchecked. But it was not the horrors of war which deterred him. He had unlimited confidence in the magnificent army and air force which he had re-created and he was certainly not averse to putting them to the test so far as Poland was concerned. In two months, he told me, the war in the East would be ended and he would then, he said, hurl 160 divisions against the Western Front if England was so unwise as to oppose his plans. His hesitation was due rather to one final effort to detach Britain from Poland. Be that as it may, at about 12-45 on the 25th August, I received a message to the effect that Herr Hitler wished to receive me at the Chancellery at 1-80 p.m. At that meeting he made to me the verbal communication which is recorded in the Blue Book.( 2 ) 35. Briefly put, Herr Hitler’s proposals therein dealt with two groups of questions : (a) the immediate necessity of a settlement of the dispute between Germany and Poland, and (6) an eventual offer of friendship or alliance between Germany and Great Britain. My interview with Plerr Hitler, at which Herr von Ribbentrop and Dr. Schmidt were also present, lasted on this occasion over an hour. The Chancellor spoke with calm and apparent sincerity. He described his proposals as a last effort, for conscience sake, to secure good relations with Great Britain, and he suggested that I should fly toO Idem No. 74. 12 London myself with them. I told his Excellency that, while I was fully prepared to consider this course, I felt it my duty to tell him quite clearly that my country could not possibly go back on its word to Poland, and that, however anxious we were for a better under standing with Germany, we could never reach one except on the basis of a negotiated settlement wdth Poland. 36. Whatever may have been the underlying motive of this final gesture on the part of the Chancellor, it was one which could not be ignored, and, with your Lordship’s consent, I flew to London early the following morning (26th August), on a German plane which was courteously put at my disposal. Two days were spent by Ills Majesty’s Government in giving the fullest and most careful consideration to Herr Hitler’s message, and on the afternoon of the 28th August I flew back to Berlin with their reply.( 3 ) Therein, while the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to Poland were reaffirmed, it was stated that the Polish Government were ready to enter into negotiations with the German Government for a reasonable solution of the matter in dispute on the basis of the safeguarding of Poland’s essential interests, and of an international guarantee for the settlement eventually arrived at. His Majesty’s Government accordingly proposed that the next step should be the initiation of direct discussions between the Polish and German Governments on that basis and the adoption of immediate steps to relieve the tension in the matter of the treatment of minorities. Furthermore, His Majesty’s Government undertook to use all their influence with a view to contributing towards a solution which might be satisfactory to both parties and which would, they hoped, prepare the way for the negotiation of that wider and more complete understanding between Great Britain and Germany which both countries desired. Finally, after a reference to a limitation of armaments, His Majesty’s Government pointed out that, whereas a just settlement of the Polish question might open the way to world peace, failure to do so would finally ruin the hopes of a better understanding between our countries and might well plunge the whole w r orld into war. 37. Before continuing the record of events after my return to Berlin on the evening of the 28th August, it is necessary to give a brief account of what had happened after my meeting with the Chancellor at 1*30 on the 25th August. At 5 p.m. on that day Herr Hitler had received the French Ambassador and given him a letter for communication to M. Daladier. Its general tenour was a sugges tion to France, with whom Germany was stated to have no quarrel, to abstain from further support of Poland. It received a dignified answer from the French Government, which was published on the 27th August. Appeals for peace were made at this time to both the German and Polish Governments as well as to other Powers by the Pope and the President of the United States of America. Though13 ( 4 ) Idem No. 75. they received a favourable response from the Polish Government, they received scant consideration from Germany. 38. On the evening of the 25th August the Anglo-Polish Pact had been signed in London. Though it had been under negotiation ^for several months, its signature gave great offence to Herr Hitler, who was at first inclined to regard it as the reply of His Majesty’s Government to his message to them. His immediate retort was the announcement on the morning of the 26th August that Herr Forster had been appointed Reichsoberhaupt, or Head of the State of Danzig. At the same time the German concentrations against Poland began to reach their final stage. 39. Thereafter there was a lull for two days pending my return to Germany with the reply of His Majesty’s Government. I had left London at 5 p.m. on the 28th August, and at 10-30 p.m. I was received by Herr Hitler at the Chancellery and handed to him that reply, together with a German translation. I sent to your Lordship a full record of my conversation with the Chancellor the same night. ( 4 ) 40. On this occasion Herr Hitler was again friendly and reason able and appeared to be not dissatisfied with the answer which I had brought to him. He observed, however, that he must study it carefully and would give me a written reply the next day. 41. I would mention incidentally that both that evening and the next, when I visited Herr Hitler again and was handed his reply, nothing was left undone to enhance the solemnity of the occasion. A considerable but quite expressionless crowd was waiting outside the Chancellery and a guard of honour awaited me in the courtyard of the main entrance. In view of what has been reported to the contrary, I desire to bear witness here to the fact that throughout the whole of those anxious weeks neither I nor my staff received anything but the utmost courtesy and civility from all Germans, except on one occasion to which I shall refer later. 42. Such information as reached me during the course of the day of the 29th August tended to represent the atmosphere as not unfavourable and to foreshadow Herr Hitler’s readiness to open direct negotiations with the Poles. I was therefore somewhat disappointed on being summoned to the Chancellery at 7-15 that evening to find the Chancellor in a far less reasonable mood than on the previous evening. The German midday Press had reported the alleged murder of six German nationals in Poland, and this story, which was probably fabricated by the extremists in fear lest he was weakening, together with the news of the Polish general mobilisation, had probably upset him. I sensed in any case a distinctly more uncompromising attitude on Herr Hitler’s part when he handed me his answer. Iread it through carefully, and, though it reiterated his demand for the whole Corridor as well as Danzig, I made no comment till I reached the phrase at the end of it, in which, after a grudging acquiescence in direct discussions with the Poles solely by way of proof of Germany's sincerity in her desire for lasting friendship with Great Britain, it was stated that “ the German Government counted/^n upon the arrival in Berlin of a Polish Emissary with full powers on the following day, Wednesday, the 30th August.” I pointed out to his Excellency that this phrase sounded very much like an ultimatum (‘‘hatte den Klang eines Ultimatums ”). This was strenuously and heatedly denied by Herr Hitler himself, supported by Herr von Bibbentrop. According to the former this sentence merely emphasised the urgency of the moment, not only on account of the risk of incidents when two mobilised armies were standing opposite one another, but also when Germans were being massacred in Poland. In this latter connection his Excellency asserted that “ I did not care how many Germans were being slaughtered in Poland.” This gratuitous impugnment of the humanity of His Majesty’s Government and of myself provoked a heated retort on my part and the remainder of the interview was of a somewhat stormy character. 43. It was closed, however, by a brief and in my opinion quite honest harangue on Herr Hitler’s part in regard to the genuineness of his constant endeavour to win Britain’s friendship, of his respect for the British Empire, and of his liking for Englishmen generallv. 44. I should like to state here, parenthetically but emphatically, that Herr Hitler’s constant repetition of his desire for good relations vith Great Britain was undoubtedly a sincere conviction. He will prove in the future a fascinating study for the historian and the biographer with psychological leanings' Widely different explana tions will be propounded, and it would be out of place and time to comment at any length in this despatch on this aspect of Herr Hitler’s mentality and character. But he combined, as I fancy many Germans do, admiration for the British race with envy of their achievements and hatred of their opposition to Germany’s excessive aspirations. It is no exaggeration to say that he assiduously courted Great Britain, both as representing the aristocracy and most success ful of the Nordic races, and as constituting the only seriouslv dangerous obstacle to his own far-reaching plan of German domina tion in Europe. This is evident in Mein Kampf, and, in spite of what le regarded as the constant rebuffs which he received from the British side, he persisted in his endeavours up to the last moment Geniuses are strange creatures, and Herr Hitler, among other paradoxes, is a mixture of long-headed calculation and violent and arrogant impulse provoked by resentment. The former drove him to seek Britain’s friendship and the latter finally into war with her. Moreover, he believes his resentment to be entirely justified. He failed to realise why his military-cum-police tyrannv should be repugnant to British ideals of individual and national freedom and( 5 ) Idem No. 78. 15 liberty, or why he should not be allowed a free hand in Central and Eastern Europe to subjugate smaller and, as he regards them, inferior peoples to superior German rule and culture. He believed he could buy British acquiescence in his own far-reaching schemes by offers of alliance with and guarantees for the British Empire. ^^Such acquiescence was indispensable to the success of his ambitions and he worked unceasingly to secure it. His great mistake was his complete failure to understand the inherent British sense of morality, humanity and freedom. 45. It must be mentioned here that the concluding passage of the Chancellor’s reply to His Majesty’s Government had contained a statement to the effect that the German Government would immediately draw up proposals for a solution of the Polish question which it would, if possible, place at the disposal of the British Government before the arrival of the Polish negotiator. 46. I had at once telegraphed to your Lordship the text of the German note( 5 ), and in the early hours of the morning of the 30th August (4 a.m.) I had already conveyed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs your interim reply,' to the effect that it would be carefully considered, but observing that it would be unreasonable to expect that His Majesty’s Government could produce a Polish representative at Berlin within twenty-four hours, and that the German Government must not count on this. 47. Later in the course of the day, I received three messages for communication to the German Government. The first was a personal one from the Prime Minister to the Chancellor notifying the latter of the representations made to Warsaw in regard to the avoidance of frontier incidents, and begging the German Government to take similar precautions. (I transmitted this in the afternoon to its destination in a personal letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.) The second similarly notified the German Government of our counsels of restraint to Poland and asked for reciprocation on Germany’s part. The third pointed out that the demand that a Polish Representative with full powers must come to Poland to receive the German proposals was unreasonable and suggested that the German Government should follow the normal procedure of inviting the Polish Ambassador to call and of handing him the German proposals for transmission to Warsaw with a view to arrangements being made for the conduct of negotiations. This last communication also reminded the German Government that it had promised to communicate its detailed proposals to His Majesty’s Government, who undertook, if they offered a reasonable basis, to do their best in Warsaw to facilitate negotiations. The good intentions of His Majesty’s Government were, in fact, patently clear and had Herr Hitler honestly desired or preferred a pacific settlement all the arrangements to that end seemed to be in full swine O *36 48. I had arranged to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs at 11-80 p.m. to make these communications to him. Shortly before the appointed time I received in code the considered reply of His Majesty’s Government to the German Note of the 29th August.( 6 ) I was accordingly obliged to ask that my meeting with Herr von Ribbentrop should be postponed for half an hour, in order to give,-^ me the time to have this last message decyphered. 49. In the final passsages of that communication His Majesty’s Government, while fully recognising the need for speed in the initiation of discussions, urged that during the negotiations no aggressive military operations should take place on either side. They further expressed their confidence that they could secure such an undertaking from the Polish Government, if the German Government would give similar assurances. They also suggested a temporary modus vivendi at Danzig, such as would obviate the risk of incidents which might render German-Polish relations still more difficult. 50. I saw Herr von Ribbentrop at exactly midnight, before which hour the German Government had ostensibly counted on the arrival of a Polish emissary at Berlin. I say “ostensibly” since it seems hardly possible that it cannot have occurred to either Herr Hitler or his Minister for Foreign Affairs that it was utterly unreasonable to expect a Polish Plenipotentiary to present himself at Berlin without even knowing in advance the basis of the proposals about which he was expected to negotiate. It is conceivable that the Army Leaders had been representing to their Fiihref that even 24 hours’ delay involved the risk of bad weather holding up the rapidity of the German advance into Poland, but, even so, it is difficult not to draw the conclusion that the proposals in themselves were but dust to be thrown in the eyes of the world with a view to its deception and were never intended to be taken seriously by the German Government itself. 51. Be that as it may, it is probable that Herr Hitler’s mood in the hour when he had to decide between peace or war was not an amiable one. It was reflected in Herr von Ribbentrop, whose reception of me that evening was, from the outset, one of intense hostility, which increased in violence as I made each communication in turn. He kept leaping from his chair in a state of great excitement, and asking if I had anything more to say. I kept replying that I had, and, if my own attitude was no less'unfriendly than his own, I cannot but say in all sincerity that I had every justification for it. When I told him that I would not fail to report his comments and remarks to my Government, he calmed down a little and said that they were his own, and that it was for Herr Hitler to decide. As for inviting the Polish Ambassador to come and see him. such a course would, he indignantly said, be utterly unthinkable and intolerable.

It seemed to me however, that he was wilfully throwing away the last chance of a peaceful solution, and it was difficult to remain indifferent when faced with such a calamity. I would merely add that, contrary to what was subsequently published in the German press, I did not discuss a , sm f le de * ail 1 . of J* 16 German proposals with Herr von Ribbentrop, who flatly declined to do so. While it is true that they were read t0 , Wa8 in such a manner as to make them practically unintelligible. J 55. I returned to His Majesty’s Embassy that night with the teelmg that the last hope for peace had vanished. I nevertheless saw the Polish Ambassador at 2 a.m., gave him a brief and studiously moderate account of my conversation with Herr von Ribbentrop, mentioned the cession of Danzig and the plebiscite in the Corridor as the two main points in the German proposals, stated that so far as I could gather they were not on the whole too unreasonable, and suggested to him that he might recommend to his Government that they should propose at once a meeting between Field-Marshals Smigly-Rydz and Goring. I felt obliged to add that I could not conceive of the success of any negotiations if they were conducted with Herr von Ribbentrop. 56. Though M. Lipski undertook to make this suggestion to his Government, it would by then probably have been in any case too late. There was, in fact, for Herr Hitler only one conceivable alter native to brute force, and that was that a Polish Plenipotentiary should humbly come to him, after the manner of Dr. Schuschnigg or President Hacha, and sign on the dotted line to the greater glory18 of Adolf Hitler. And even that must happen at once. The Army was asking “ Yes ” or “ No,” since the success of its plans depended largely on the rapid occupation of Poland and the conclusion as soon as possible of the war on the Eastern front. Bad weather might otherwise intervene at any time and was likely to prove one of Poland’s best defences against the highly mechanised German army. Moreover, a week had already been lost by Herr Hitler’s hesitation on the 25th August. 57. I have no doubt that such and other considerations were present in Herr Hitler’s mind on the night of the 80th August. I was consequently not surprised when I received in the early hours of the morning of the 81st reliable information that the actual decision had been taken to order the advance of the German Army by midday or 1 p.m. if no Polish Plenipotentiary had arrived before then. I believe this information to have been accurate, and I attribute the further brief respite which ensued to the twelfth-hour efforts of the Italian Government to restrain Herr Hitler from war. 58. I had in the meantime obtained from another source more definite, if unauthorised, details of the German proposals, and these I at once communicated through the Counsellor of His Majesty’s Embassy to the Polish Ambassador, who spent that morning on the telephone to Warsaw. About the middle of the day I had transmitted to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs a further message from His Majesty’s Government to the German Government notifying them that the Polish Government were taking steps to establish contact with them through the Polish Ambassador at Berlin, and asking them to agree to an immediate provisional modus vivendi at Danzig, for which purpose M. Burckhardt was suggested as intermediary. To this communication I never received any reply. There was, however, a further delay of some 12 hours. The Polish Government had authorised their Ambassador to establish contact with Herr von Ribbentrop, and Herr Hitler waited to see what message M. Lipski would bring. The question, in fact, was whether his qualifications would be those of a Plenipotentiary empowered by the Polish Govern ment to conduct and conclude negotiations or not. On no other terms was Hitler prepared to postpone action. His army was ready and Poland must be taught a lesson. She must crawl or get her whipping. 59. During the day there had been much activity on the part of Field-Marshal Goring. I think there can be no doubt that Field- Marshal Goring himself would have preferred a peaceful solution, but in matters such as these it was Herr Hitler’s decision which alone counted; and whatever Field-Marshal Goring himself might feel, he was merely the loyal and submissive servant of his master. Moreover, he had come down definitely on the side of peace a year before and it may have been difficult for him to adopt this course a second time. He invited me, however, to come and see him that11 ) afternoon, and I did so at 5 p.m. in company of Sir G. Ogilvie* lorbes. Inasmuch as I had heard that the text of the proposals which Herr von Ribbentrop had refused to give me was to be announced that evening, my first remark was to point out to the Field-Marshal that this procedure would probably and finally wreck ^Hhe last prospect of peace and to beg him to do his utmost to prevent ^■their publication. Field-Marshal Goring’s reply was that he could not intervene, and that the German Government felt obliged to broadcast their proposals to the world in order to prove their “ good faith.” 60. Instead he talked for the best part of two hours of the iniquities of the Poles and about Herr Hitler’s and his own desire for friendship with England, and of the benefit to the world in general and the advantage to England in particular of such a friendship. It w r as a conversation which led nowhere and I could not help feeling that his remarks, which from his point of view were perfectly genuine but which I had heard often before, were chiefly intended for the edification of his listeners. I augured the worst from the fact that he was in a position at such a moment to give me so much of his time. He had a few days before been made president of the new German Defence Council for the Reich (or War Cabinet) and he could scarcely have afforded at such a moment to spare time in conversation if it did not mean that everything down to the last detail was now ready for action. 61. Incidentally the composition of that council was evidence of Herr Hitler’s acumen. He had selected for it all the most respectable of the Nazi leaders, such as Herr Frick, Dr. Rammers, Dr. Funk, who might be counted upon, with Field-Marshal Goring himself the most popular of them all with the general public, to inspire the confidence of the German people. The worst extremists and the most unpopular with the people were omitted from it. To them was to be confided the less enviable task of dealing with the neutrals, of organising the Interior and of ruthlessly repressing any internal discontent. My general impression of this last talk with Field-Marshal Goring was, in fact, that it constituted a final but forlorn effort on his part to detach Britain from the Poles. Nevertheless the Field-Marshal seemed sincere when, having been called to the telephone, he returned to tell us that M. Lipski was on his way to see Herr von Ribbentrop. He seemed to hope that, provided contact was only established, war might after all prove unnecessary. The meeting between the Polish Ambassador proved, however, quite futile. M. Lipski stated that he was acting solely in his capacity as an Ambassador without plenary powers to discuss or to negotiate, and handed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs a brief communication to the effect that the Polish Government were weighing favourably the proposal of His Majesty’s Government for direct discussion and that a formal answer in this matter would be communicated to the German Government in the immediate future.20 He did not ask for the German proposals and Herr von Ribbentrop did not offer to give them to him. Their meeting lasted but a few minutes. 62. Early in the morning I had rung up the State Secretaiy and, after pointing out that the German Government had promised to communicate these proposals to His Majesty s Government, and k how helpless I was without the authorised text of them, had asked him to suggest to Herr von Ribbentrop once more that they should be communicated to me. I heard no more from Baron von \\eizsacker until late in the evening, when I received a message asking me to call upon him at 9‘15 p.m. Similar messages had been sent to the French Ambassador and to the United States Charge d Affaires, giving them appointments for 9'30 and 9'45 respectively. I accordingly called on Baron von Weizsacker at the hour named and received from him the text of the proposals, together with an explanatory statement^ 7 ) As both these documents had already been broadcast at 9 p.m. I asked the Secretary of State what was the point now of making these communications to me. Baron von Weizsacker observed that he w r as merely carrying out his instructions and that he could make no further statement to me. I could only infer from this reply that Herr Hitler had taken his final decision. I accordingly drafted that night a telegram to your Lordship to the effect that it would be quite useless for me to make any further suggestions since they would now only be outstripped by events and that the only course remaining to us was to show our inflexible determination to resist force by force. 63. In point of fact the advance into Poland had been ordered that night, and in the early hours of the 1st September without any declaration of war the German army crossed the frontier and the German Air Force proceeded to bomb the Polish aerodromes and lines of communications. 64. In accordance with Herr Hitler’s usual technique everything was done by the German authorities to prove to the German public that it was the Poles who had been the aggressors instead of the aggressed. Cynical notices were communicated at 6 a.m. to His Majesty’s Embassy notifying me that the Bay of Danzig was closed both to navigation and to flying in view of the possibility of military operations ‘ ‘ against hostile attacks by Polish naval forces or by Polish aircraft.” Field-Marshal Goring also sent me a message to say that the Poles had begun the war by blowing up the bridge across the Vistula at Dirchau, while Herr Hitler himself issued a proclama tion to the German army, declaring that the Polish State had refused the settlement which he offered and had appealed to arms, that the Germans in Poland were being persecuted by a bloody terror, and that the Poles were no longer willing to respect the frontier of the German Reich. Every German newspaper repeated the lie that it 0 Idem No. 98.was the Poles who had begun the fighting. Finally at 10'30 A.nk Herr Hitler met the Reichstag which had been summoned for that hour, and ^ similarly announced to the assembled Delegates that he had been “ forced to take up arms in defence of the Reich.” The die had in fact been cast and never can there have been or ever be p case of more deliberate and carefully planned aggression. 65. Late that evening I was instructed by your Lordship to notify the German Government that the latter by their action had created conditions which called for the implementation by the Govern ments of the United Kingdom and France of their undertaking to come to Poland’s assistance, and that, unless His Majesty’s Govern ment received satisfactory assurances that the German Government had suspended all aggressive action and would be prepared to with draw its forces from Polish territory, His Majesty’s Government would, without hesitation, fulfil their obligations to Poland. I was instructed at the same time to request an immediate reply, and was authorised, if asked, to explain that this communication was in the nature of a warning, and was not to be considered as an ultimatum. 66. I handed this communication in writing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at 9*30 p.m. that evening. Herr von Ribbentrop received it without other comment than that the sole blame rested on the Poles, that it was they who had first mobilised and who had first invaded Germany with troops of the regular army. He made no enquiry as to the nature of the communication which he merely said that he must submit to the Fuhrer. I said that I realised that this would be necessary, and that I would be available at whatever hour he might be in a position to give me the Reichschancellor’s reply. The French Ambassador, who had been instructed to make a similar communication, did so immediately after me and received a reply on the same lines. 67. Earlier in the afternoon of that day, in accordance with your Lordship’s instructions, I had officially requested the United States Charge d’Affaires to be good enough to take charge of British interests in the event of war. All cyphers and confidential documents were burnt, and the whole of the Staff left their normal residences and were concentrated in the Adlon Hotel next door or in the Embassy itself. All the arrangements were carried out with a maximum of efficiency and a minimum of confusion, which did the utmost credit to the organisation and competency of the very excellent Staff of His Majesty’s Embassy. The chief responsibility for this rested upon Mr. Holman, as Head of the Chancery. 68. The 2nd September was a day of suspense. The Poles were, it was reported, putting up a brave resistance in the face of surprise and overwhelming numbers, and in spite of the vast superiority of the German air force and mechanised forces. No reply was received from the German Government throughout the day to the British and French warnings.22 * 69. On the other hand, the Italian Government was making one more effort to save the situation. The Italian Ambassador had come to see me at midday on his way to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Signor Attolico told me that he must know one thing immediately. Was the communication which I had made the previous evening to Herr von Ribbentrop an ultimatum or not? I told his Excellency that'^ I had been authorised to tell the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he had asked me—which he had not done—that it was not an ultimatum but a warning. I mentioned to Signor Attolico that I understood that the Italian Government had put forward a suggestion for the cessation of hostilities and the immediate summoning of a conference of the interested Powers. In this connection I said that I felt bound to express the opinion that such a proposal would never be entertained unless at the same time all the German troops were withdrawn from Polish territory. 70. The Ambassador retorted that I could not speak for my Government. I admitted that fact, hut said that I could not imagine the possibility of ourselves, and much less of the Poles, agreeing to any lesser course. I do not know what reply, if any, was given by the German Government to this proposal. But I should like to put on record here that no one ever worked harder for peace than did Signor Attolico not only this year but last year also. He was entirely selfless in this his earnest endeavour. 71. There were, in fact, for Herr Hitler only two solutions : the use of force, or the achievement of his aims by the display of force. “ If you wish to obtain your objective by force, you must be strong; if you wish to obtain them by negotiation, you must be stronger still.” That was a remark which he made to a foreign Statesman who visited him this year, and it expresses in the concisest possible form the Hitler technique. It was exactly that which he displayed in September 1938. He was no more bluffing then than he was bluffing in August 1939. Up to the middle of August this year the fear of a war on two fronts, with Russia hostile or at least unfriendly, might possibly have deterred him and his military advisers from action against Poland. There was no Eastern front to give him cause for hesitation in 1938, and he could have counted then on Hungarian as well as Polish support in his nefarious plans for the dismember ment of Czecho-Slovakia. But for Munich he would without a shadow of doubt have invaded that country on the 29th September last year, just as surely as he invaded Poland on the 1st September this year, and the war would have come eleven months earlier. In both cases the methods employed were identical: the gradual mobilisation of the German army over a period of months and its secret concentration at the appointed positions, whence the advance could begin at almost any moment and within a very few hours. 72. So it was again in 1939. If he could have secured his objectives by this display of force he might have been content for the moment, with all the additional prestige which another bloodlesssuccess would have procured for him with his own people. But it would only have been to start again once the world had recovered from the shock, and even his own people were beginning to be tired of these repeated crises. Millions of Germans had begun to long for a more peaceful existence. Guns instead of butter were becoming jnore and more unpopular except with the younger generation, and Tlitler may well have wondered what might happen to his Nazi revolution if its momentum were allowed to stop. Moreover the financial and economic position of Germany was such that things could scarcely continue as they were without some form of explosion, internal or external. Of the two alternatives the most attractive from the point of view of his growing personal ambitions, and those of the clique which was nearest to him, was war. 73. It is scarcely credible that he would have acted as he did if bloody war, rather than a bloodless victory, had not seemed the fairer prospect for him. He had always meant to teach the Poles a lesson for what he regarded as their base ingratitude in refusing the “generous” demands which he had made to them in March. His only manoeuvres since that date were with the object of creating circumstances favourable to his plans or of inducing Britain and France to abandon their Polish ally and to leave him a free hand in Central and Eastern Europe. 74. To this end, encouraged by Herr von Bibbentrop, who apparently advised him up to the last moment that Britain would not fight, he worked unceasingly. In the course of one of the five interviews which I had with him during those last few days, I remarked to him that it was he who was ungenerous to the Poles, in view of the advantages which his treaty of 1934 with Pilsudski had brought him. Herr Hitler denied that that treaty had ever been of any benefit to Germany and asserted that it had merely been unpopular with the Germans. It was a remark which was typical of Herr Hitler’s capacity to ignore everything which he might have said, promised or done in the past as soon as it had become contrary to views for the present or the future. 75. One of Herr Hitler’s greatest drawbacks is that, except, for two official visits to Italy, he has never travelled abroad. For his knowledge of British mentality he consequently relied on Herr von Ribbentrop as an ex-Ambassador to Britain, who spoke both French and English, and who had spent some years in Canada, and whom he regarded as a man of the world. If report be true Herr von Ribbentrop gave him consistently false counsels in regard to England, while his successes in other spheres induced Herr Hitler to regard him more and more as a second Bismarck, a conviction which Herr von Ribbentrop probably shared to the full. 76. Even the most absolute Dictator is susceptible to the influence of his surroundings. Nevertheless Herr Hitler’s decisions, his calculations, and his opportunisms were his own. As Field-24 Marshal Goring once said to me, “ when a decision has to be taken, none of us count more than the stones on which we are standing. It is the Fiihrer alone who decides.” If anything did count, it was the opinion of his Military Advisers. I have always believed that it was they who, in the interests of Germany’s strategical security, recommended the establishment of the Protectorate ovp^ Bohemia. And again this August, it was they, I fancy, who toi Herr Hitler that further delay would be fatal lest the seasonal bad weather in Poland might upset their calculations for her swift overthrow. The army grudged him even the week between the 25th August and the 1st September which his last attempt to secure British neutrality or at least goodwill had cost it. 77. Yet even so the advice of his soldiers was probably merely cover for the prosecution of Hitler’s own plans. His impatience and precipitate action on that last day of August can scarcely have been other than premeditated. All through the summer he had been waiting on events to turn in his favour and had been making his preparations to seize the opportunity, when it was offered to him. The Russian pact appeared to give him the advantage which he was seeking and thereafter there was no time to lose, if mud was not to be added to Poland’s allies. 78. When therefore the Polish Government delayed 48 hours in sending its Plenipotentiary to beg for terms at Berlin and even then sent only an Ambassador without plenary powers, Herr Hitler in spite of the expressed readiness of Poland to enter into direct negotiations, finally made up his mind not to keep his army waiting any longer. The order for the advance into Poland was probably given immediately after M. Lipski’s interview with Herr von Ribbentrop at 6'80 p.m. on the 81st August. 79. Late in the afternoon of the 2nd September I communicated to the Secretary of State for the information of the German Govern ment the verbatim report of the Prime Minister’s speech in the House of Commons on that date. Therein Mr. Chamberlain stated that while His Majesty’s Government could not agree to the proposal of the Italian Government for a conference while Poland was being subjected to invasion, they would be willing, if the German forces were withdrawn from Polish territory, to regard the position as being the same as before the forces had crossed the frontier. It was the last chance of avoiding the great catastrophe of war at the last minute, but the German Government remained silent. 80 In the early hours (4 a.m.) of the 3rd September I was accordingly instructed by your Lordship to arrange for a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs at 9 a.m. There was some difficulty in establishing contact with the Ministry at that hour but I was finally informed that Dr. Schmidt was authorised by the Minister to accept on his Excellency’s behalf any communication25 which I might make to him. I accordingly handed to Dr. Schmidt at 9 a.m. precisely the final ultimatum from His Majesty’s Govern ment, pointing out that over 24 hours had elapsed since I had requested an immediate answer to our warning communication of the 1st September, that since then the attacks on Poland had been Mtensified, and that, unless satisfactory assurances were received by Bis Majesty’s Government before 11 a.m. British summer time of the suspension of all aggressive action against Poland and of the with drawal of the German forces from that country, a state of war would exist between our two countries as from that hour. 81. Dr. Schmidt received this communication and undertook to deliver it immediately to his Chief. As no reply from the German Government was vouchsafed by 11 a.m., the German Representative in London was informed in due course at that hour that a state of war existed between Britain and Germany. By 10 minutes past 11 a.m. every British consular officer in Germany had been advised by the staff of His Majesty’s Embassy at Berlin that this was the case. 82. Shortly after 11 a.m. I received a final message from Herr von Ribbentrop asking me to call upon him at once. I did so at 11-80 and he handed me this time a lengthy document to read, beginning with a refusal on the part of the German people to accept any demands in the nature of an ultimatum made by the British Government, and stating that any aggressive action by England would be answered with the same weapons and the same form. The rest of the document was pure propaganda with a view to attempting to prove to the German people and the world generally that it was Britain alone who was to blame for everything which had happened. My only comment on reading this completely false representation of events was : “ It would be left to history to judge where the blame really lav.” Herr von Ribbentrop’s answer was to the effect that history had already proved the facts, and that nobody had striven harder for peace and good relations with England than Herr Hitler himself His last remark to me was that he wished me personally good, to which I could only reply that I deeply regretted the failure of all mv efforts for peace, but that I bore no grudge against the German people. Thereafter I saw no further German official except the member of the Protocol, who accompanied our special tram as far as Rotterdam. My last official communication to the German Government was a note which I presented on the instructions of His Majesty’s Government enquiring whether the German would observe the provisions of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 p hibiting the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases and of bacteriological methods of warfare—I im&amp;erBtmd ^ the German Government have since replied through the Swiss Mmiste in London giving the required assurance on the understanding that His Majesty’s Government would similarly observe the provisions o the Protocol.83. The French Ambassador had presented at noon a similar ultimatum to the German Government to expire at 5 p.m. For a few hours after 11 a.m. the telephonic lines of His Majesty’s Embassy at Berlin continued to function, but about 4 p.m. all telephonic lines were cut off and both the Staff at the Adlon Hotel and the Embassy itself was isolated from all external contact. Members of my st^L* however, had visited the Protocol at 11 a.m. with a view to arrangL for our departure. They were treated with every civility and com sideration and were informed that a special train would be placed at our disposal the following morning. 84. Our only contact thereafter with the outside world was through the American Embassy. Its aid and help was invaluable. No trouble was too great for the Charge d’Affaires, Mr. Alexander Kirk, and the members of his staff. They did everything that was possible to smooth over the difficulties of those last 24 hours, and our pleasantest recollection of them is our appreciation of the great sympathy and willing assistance which we received from the American Embassy. 85. The French Embassy left Berlin at 9 a.m. the following morning,. Monday, the 4th September. The British Embassy followed in a special train, leaving the Charlottenberg station at 11-20 a.m. The whole party consisted of 30 men, 7 women and 2 dogs. A small crowd collected round the Embassy before our departure, but unlike 1914 it evinced no single sign of hostility. Mr. Kirk rendered me one more last service by driving me to the station in his own car. The streets of Berlin were practically deserted and there was nothing to indicate the beginning of a war which is to decide whether force is to be the sole arbiter in inter national affairs; whether international instruments solemnly and freely entered into are to be modified, not by negotiation, but by mere unilateral repudiation; whether there is to be any faith in future in written contracts; whether the fate of a great nation and the peace of the world is to rest in the future in the hands of one man; whether small nations are to have any rights against the pretensions of States more powerful than themselves; in a word, whether government of the people by the people for the people is to continue in this world, or whether it is to be replaced by the arbitrary will and ambition of single individuals regardless of the peoples’ will. 86. Our journey through Germany, if prolonged, was uneventful. At the various stations at which we stopped there was some curiosity but no evidence of hostility. We reached Rheine, a small station some 20 kilom. from the German frontier, at about 6 p.m. on the Monday evening. There our train w-as detained for nearly twentv hours pending the safe arrival in Dutch territorial waters of the German mission from London. We eventually left Rheine at 1*30 p.m. on Tuesday and were received with great hospitality at21 the Dutch frontier. We reached Rotterdam that evening, and after spending a night at The Hague and one on board the Dutch steamer Batavier V, left Rotterdam in the early hours of Thursday morning, the 6th September. We arrived at Gravesend about 6 p.at. that evening. I have, &amp;c.

Main reason for lon£j detention of certain neutral ships at contraband control bases is that the Contraband Committee finds' it necessary in certain cases to seek guarantees irom consignees of the goods or from governments that neither goods nor products or equivalent will be exported to Germany. In order to avoid delay while this is being done, some shipping companies give undertakings, as during the last war, that if their ships are allowed to proceed they will retain the goods in such cases until a decision has been reached, but certain Shipping Companies will not do this. The ships must therefore either be kept at the contraband control bases or their cargoes allowed to go forward without any guarantee that they will not reach Germany. One ship which had been held for a long time was released with ‘an incomplete guarantee to save further delay, and the cargo is known to have gone on to Germany. * It is however hoped that from now on position will be greatly improved as a result of an agreement which has been reached with neutral ship-owners whereby ships' manifests will be forwarded to British contraband authorities as long as possible in advance of the arrival in British waters of ships concernedo As a result it should be possible in many cases to complete the necessary enquiries regarding the destination of suspect items of cargo before the ship actually arrives„ If the cargo is found to contain items of contraband, the ship can then be directed to London or elsewhere to unload them with as little delay as possible, whereas if there is no contraband on board it can proceed without hindrance to its port of destination 0 It is hoped that this system will remove the chief cause for cooipbaint of' neutral ship-ownerso If owners will supply their London agents with full details of the cargo in advance, delays arising from discrepancies subsequently discovered between ships' manifest and information in the possession of the Ministry of Economic Warfare v^ould be avoided^ German attempts to camouflage consi nments also have to be taxon into accounto As regard^ delays to passengers in ships which are detained, it is .hoped in future to arrange that passengers shall be landed at once and permitted to proceed to their destination by the .ickest available route. It is hoped that this gesture may be appreciated in neutral countries. Above measures will not of course entirely eliminate delays and inconveniences caused to neutral shipping.which must be regarded as regrettable necessity if our efforts to prevent essential materials reaching Germany are to achieve any success.

German propaganda constantly states French gains Western Front small, Saarbrucken, an open town only two miles inside frontier still in German hands and Siegfried line far behind bombarded but otherwise intact. ^ ^ , Germans would doubtless prefer frontal attacks and large casualty lists but military operations not the most important part in first stage of present war. Allies warned by painful experiences last war are conducting methodical siege war. These restrained tactics already achieved at very small cost in casualties results great value of which cannot be guaged from depth of French penetration alone. Saarbriicken is an important road and railway junction; it is now surrounded on three sides and all roads and railways under fire of powerful French artillery solidly established on surrounding heights: capture of town would add nothing to this but would entail unnecessary casualties through traps ©r hand-to-hand fightingo Nothing would have been easier than t© shell this open town with its 1 rfre civilian population (130,000) but French of course refuse t© follow Hitler‘s example in Poland. Presence of French troops on German soil has deeply affected morale of Rhineland population from whom Nazis concealed truth as long as possible. Over two million people have been evacuated from this region, an experience which Germans have not endured for over one century. Economic results also of first importance.

Begins . It is learnt that 23 neutral merchant ships have been sunk to date by German mines or submarines besides 9 Swedish ships held up at Goteborg on account of danger of German mines. Germany may soon begin question wisdom of sinking neutrals because great majority ships sunk belong to Scandinavian countries which are practically only countries with which Germany is able to Ccxry on see trade. Since introduction convoy system until 10th October 1,275 British and 47 Allied ships safely convoyed^to their destination no convoy ship being' sunk by enemy submarines. Sinking of three further U-boats announced yesterday is further illustration of success of arrangements made by Admiralty for safety of shipping coming bo Britain. Germany today such financial straits that her merchant ships may soon be compelled to leave neutral ports where refuging owing to inability to pay harbour dues. German vessel MIMHIORN arrested Curacao owing to inability to pay harbour dues. German wireless has given out astonishing statement that members of former Polish Government interned in Roumania have declared new Government to be illegal and real nation of President Mosciciki invalid. Absurdity of statement is demonstrated by fact that immediately after his assumption of office new Polish President received telegram signed by all members of former Polish Government expressing their entire loyalty to him and at same time tendering their resignations.

Nevertheless it is recognised that Lithuania's acquisition of Vilna cannot be regarded in seme way or condemned so strongly as German-Soviet partition of Poland. In first place Treaty with Russia was forced upon Lithuania at point of bayonet; and if Russia offered her certain territorial compensation in retvrn for virtue.! loss of independence which Treaty involves she can hardly be blamed for accepting it.

Begina 0 German wireless gave out a long statement on 11th October, purporting to prove that, during the month which preceded the British guarantee to Poland, Polish Government had deliberately misled the British and French Governments about the nature of German proposals for a settlement of outstanding questions,. The truth is that when guarantee was given both British and French Governments were well aware that Hitler had demanded certain territorial concessions which the Polish Government refused as inconsistent with their sovereign rights. But as has been publicly stated on many occasions since, the German demands had been definitely rejected on the Polish side some time before the Polish Government even knew that we had any intention of offering them a guarantee,. This is the important point,. The question of the precise moment at which the full extent of the German demands was revealed in London is one of purely academic interest. Ends .

Be/rins . Soviet actio n in the BaltiC o It should be emphasised that, although Russian action is, of course, indefensible, Germany is the most to blame for what is happening in the Baltic States and Finland. Germany led these countries to look to her as their chief protection against Communism. She has now left them entirely at the mercy of Russia, thereby providing further proof of her treachery towards those with whom she professes friendship, and the hollowness of her pretention that she controls the Baltic The Soviet bases in the Baltic States and in Finland will be more of a threat to Germany than to anyone else. It is clearly necessity rather than choice that has made Germany thus abandon the Eastern Baltic to Russia. As regards the evacuation of Germans and German Balts from Baltic'States the following is relevant: Only a small proportion of these people are Nazi by conviction. Faced with the choice of Bolshevisation or return to the Reich, they prefer the latter alternative, beim racially German. This return of the Balts is yet another si-n of German weakness and treachery. Germany has in the past always claimed the Baltic States as Y/ithin her sphere of cultural influence* She is now cynically abandoning them to Russia and meting out to the considerable German minorities there the same treatment as she accorded to the Tyrolese.

Soviet German alliance robbed her fruits her victory in Poland and enabled Russia gain predominant influence in Balkans as well as in her old Baltic provinces now Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Germany has lost her command of Baltic Sea. On Western Front tine is in our favour. Germany is in cleft stick and must attack or starve. Seas closed to her Russian help in food and raw materials is problematical and internal conditions are deteriorating. If she attacks she loses perhaps million Men if remains inactive she collapses. Threats to subject Paris, London to aerial attack will not intimidate public but meet with such reaction that would recoil tenfold on head of Germany.

'Hitler through Ribbentrop not only ceded Estonia Latvia as Russian spheres interest but also informed Stalin he was prepared in certain circumstances admit of Russian action against Finland. It should however be added that army command did not learn of latter until after Ribbentrop returned from Moscow and then expressed deepest concern at suggestion allow Russia have this northern country.

Be gins , Far from it being true as suggested by German propaganda that the British economic structure is cracking British resources are only beginning to be developed© Whereas Germany has no foreign exchange and a smaller gold reserve than in 1918, the annual income on British foreign investments alone is 2200,000,000 a year and in gold, foreign exchange and income-yielding investments, Britain has £100 a head of population as compared with £47 a head in the wealthy United States© Our annual national income is over £107 a head compared with £62i in Germany and although Britain has a budget expenditure of £2,000,000,000 a year at' present, if half the British national income is devoted to war expenditure Britain can easily spend double what she is now spending on the war effort© The income tax on the lower ranges of income is less than one-fifth of what it is in Germany. Married Germans pay income tax over £65, married British only over £225© Britain also has a labour strength of 1,500,000 men on which to draw, one-half of whom can be employed in the armament industries© Germany has a labour scarcity© By controlling the Atlantic sea routes we draw on vast economic resources of the Dominions© There are ample food stocks in Britain and rationing has not even been introduced yet© Binds .

To attempt - as German propaganda does - to saddle us with the responsibility for continuing the war because we are not prepared to abandon the struggle before this purpose is achieved, is only another instance of German war' technique. The responsibility for the war rests upon those who have conceived and carried out this policy of successive aggression, and it can neither be evaded nor excused.” 'Ho mere assurances from the present German Government could be accepted by us. For that Government have too often proved in the past that their undertakings are worthless when it suits then that they should be broken. If, therefore, proposals are made, we shall certainly examine then and we shell test them in the light of what I have just said.

In fact, because they have not command of the sea and except in Baltic and other rare instances are not in position to bring neutral shipping for examination to German ports, they cannot exercise legal contraband control and there is increasing evidence of their intention to substitute piracy for it. Since outbreak of war ten neutral vessels - three Finnish, two Greek, one Danish, one Dutch, one Belgian and one Norwegian have been sunk by German action, that is by torpedo, bombing or explosives placed in them by German submarines or by mines w^ere no British mines have been laid. In addition to these ten, Norwegian Honda was sunk on 13th September off Terskelling by an explosion probably due to German mine. Germans may plead that neutral ships which strike mines were not deliberately sunk, but German action in recent days against Martti Ragnar, Walma, Gertrud Bratt, Fanefjeld, suggest a purposeful war against neutral shipping'.

In view of the Government of India*s apparent anxiety in regard to Amanullah we at once got in touch with the Foreign Office, who telegraphed at our request on 24th September to Rome, Moscow and Angora. A copy of Foreign Office telegram, which was repeated to certain other posts, will be found at P.Z.6010/39. The Foreign Office were not sure whether it was really necessary to send this telegram since they felt that H.M. Representatives would in any case certainly inform the Minister at Kabul and the Government of India at once if they heard anything of Amanullah*s movements. They also pointed out that if Amanullah were indeed in Moscow at the present moment it was highly improbable that our Embassy in Moscow would be aware of it. Tfcey are also investigating the possibility of improving our intelligence in Italy and Switzerland in regard to Amanullah*s movements. I have discussed this question with I.P.I., who is looking into the matter. He explains however that in Italy, at any rate, it is now exceedingly difficult to obtain prompt ^information of this kind owing to the impossibility of obtaining any co-operation from the Italian authorities.

The Government of India have also asked for material for use in the Press and elsewhere as regards the attitude of Russia, Japan and Italy and the Ministry of Information were approached about this over the weekend. The matter was brought to the attention of Sir Findlater Stewart at the Ministry, &lt; who pointed out that the Government of India (and especially the Viceroy himself) were already being kept very closely in touch with the situation. He also emphasised the obvious difficulties, which must be apparent to the Government of India, in regard to publicity about Russia, Japan and Italy so long as the attitude of these countries towards the European conflict remained undefined, and the danger of tipping the scales in the wrong direction by making indiscreet statements in the Press and elsewhere. The Government of India certainly seem to be making rather heavy weather of this question but it seems that what they require is not 80 much additional matter for publicity purposes, since they must already have almost as much as is available here, as guidance with respect to the limits within which this material may be used in the Press or elsewhere. The Ministry of Information have however produced a certain amount of further material (see the enclosure to Mr. Hodson’s letter of 26th September and note by Sir John Pratt with Sir Findlater Stewart’s Comment upon it - flagged,) though all this hardly carries us much further than the arguments with which we have already provided the Government of India in Forminka telegram Ko. 103 of 19th September and the Secretary of State’s telejrra;.

The view held by the Par Eastern Department in the Foreign Office is that the truce between Russia and Japan on the Mongolian border has not altered the fundamental relations between the two countries and our Press summaries from Tokyo indicate ^■'‘'‘'^that this is realised in Japan. This sort of truce ha$ happened- many times during the past eight years. It simply means that local fighting starts, but thet the Governments on both sides do not want it to develop into a major war - neither being ready - and agree on a truce, but the fundamental causes of hostility are so great that the truce is never more than an uneasy one of short duration. Both sides know that the battle must be fought out some day. Either Japan must turn Russia out of Vladivostok or Russia must turn Japan out of the empty spaces of Central Asia and off the mainland of Asia altogether. Russia wants a truce while she is fighting in the jest; Japan wants a truce while she is settling with China. In a very short time they will be ready to attack each other again; and it is fantastic to suppose that Russia, with her loose and inefficient organisation, will ever be able to invade India with a watchful and powerful enemy like Japan ready to attack at the first favourable opportunity (signed) J.

Following telegram sent by Ministry of Information to HoM’s Missions abroad is repeated for your information. Begins . German blockade propaganda . In countering this it is important to emphasize that our present system of contraband control does not constitute formal blockade. Following points may be useful. The essence of blockade is the prevention of all ingress to or egress from the blockaded locality, irrespective of the nature of the goods concerned, or of whether they consist of actual contraband. For such action to be lav/ful it must be effective, i 0 e e passage across the blockading line must be rendered virtually impossible or highly dangerous. The penalty for breach of blockade is confiscation of the ship as well as, in most cases, of the cargo which will in any case not be allowed to proceed. Contraband control, which is selective in its action, aims only at preventing certain classes of goods reaching the enemy either directly or through neutral countries. A belligerent is entitled to exercise this control to such extent, great or small, as his means allow and the legality of the action is not dependent on the ability to stop and examine all vessels carrying goods of enemy destination. The penalty for carriage of contraband is ordinarily only confiscation of the contraband cargo itself. Unless the vessel has enemy character she is unaffected save in special circumstances which need not be detailed here. finds.

Foreign Office, Septembe?' 11, 1939. Sir, I ENCLOSE a copy in print of a despatch which has been addressed to His Majesty’s Minister at Bangkok on the subject of the pressure which the Germans and Japanese have been applying to Thailand. 2. The memorandum enclosed in that despatch sets out some of the principal difficulties facing Germany, Italy and Japan at the present time and I feel that it may be of use to His Majesty’s Representatives generally in their endeavours to dissipate any exaggerated fears that may be engendered by the propagation of alarmist stories similar to those referred to. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, HALIFAX. His Majesty’s Representative at (062/1939) 10542 19928—2Appendix to Circular Despatch 062/1939. CONFIDENTIAL. [F 4802/1860/40] O Viscount Halifax to Sir J. Crosby (Bangkok). (No. 99.) Sir, Foreign Office, June 7, 1939. I HAVE read with interest your despatch No. 236 of the 10th May on the subject of the pressure which the Germans and the Japanese appear recently to have been applying to Siam. I agree with the opinion you express in paragraph 4 that the probability of a Japanese attack on Burma, or even on Tonkin, is highly remote and I also share your view that the Japanese are scarcely likely to have furnished the Siamese with authentic information as to their secret military plans. I am, however, inclined to suspect that the reports of such plans which were mentioned by Prince Aditya to M. Lepissier may, none the less, have emanated from Japanese sources. Indeed, it seems probable that Japan may be adopting in the Far East the same policy which Germany and Italy have been pursuing with success in Europe. Japan, in fact, would seem to be engaged in the deliberate and systematic circulation of rumours as to her predatory intentions with a view to disturbing the international atmosphere and creating a general state of nervous apprehension and exasperation. By this means she not only hopes in the long run to succeed in wearing down the resistance of the Powers opposed to her, but also to be able to judge from the degree of credence accorded to these rumours just how high to pitch her demands at any particular moment. 2. I would suggest that you might take an early opportunity to convey informally to Prince Aditya and M. Lepissier that we have some reason to suspect that Japan is adopting these tactics. At your discretion you may invite them to inform you of any other similar rumours that reach their ears, saying that your Government would like to collect and collate as many of these reports as possible. 3. At the same time, I feel that active steps should be taken to counteract the effect produced by the circulation of these rumours by the Japanese. Such action might take the form whenever opportunity offers of emphasising and drawing attention to the weaknesses inherent in the^position of Japan and of her ideological associates. I enclose a memorandum compiled in this department setting out some of the principal difficulties facing these three Powers at the piesent time and I hope that this will be of use to you in your endeavours to dissipate any exaggerated fears that may be engendered by the propagation of alarmist stories. You will, of course, recognise that the picture of the situation presented i xt, 18 memoran d u p is necessarily incomplete. No mention is made there either of the factors making for the strength of the Anti-Comintern Powers or of the difficulties inherent m our own position. The latter are both palpable and obvious3 and it would be out of place to mention them here. You will naturally not allow yourself to be drawn into any discussion of them or of the plans we have made to deal with them, the disclosure of which to any Government, however friendly, would involve the risk of leakage. I am, &amp;c. HALIFAX. Enclosure. (A) Germany. ALTHOUGH the Germans have built up an enormous fagade of military strength with which their propaganda machine seeks to impress the world, there are many chinks in the German armour of which the Germans themselves are only too painfully aware. In the first place, there is in Germany to-day a serious shortage of trained reserves, a shortage which causes the Higher Command to admit in conversation that the German army to-day is nothing like as efficient as it was in 1914. It must be borne in mind that the Germans have only had compulsory military service since 1934; that is to say, only two classes of trained conscripts have passed to the reserve, in addition to the ex-soldiers and others who have had short refresher courses. Not only is there, therefore, a serious shortage of reservists, but what is still more serious, it has been impossible to create an efficient corps of reserve officers. Even the active units of the German army are to-day short of officers, and there is no means of filling this lacuna. Secondly, the Germans are sufiering from a lack of the raw materials necessary for the prosecution of a long war. It had been hoped, for example, to manufacture synthetic petrol on a scale sufficient to supply German peace-time needs, without imports from abroad. I his calculation has miscarried, owing to the fact that the motorisation of the army, the expansion of the air force, and°the requirements of the civilian population have in the last two years outstripped all expectations. For war purposes the Germans are still therefore dependent on imported petrol, and it is not believed that they possess sufficient stocks to carry on for more than six months. Thirdly, although there is enough food in Germany to feed the population, the margin is very narrow, and it is doubtful whether,'under the strain of war| a food shortage would not develop. As it is, the situation to-day is not unlike that obtaining in Germany in 1916. To embark on a European war in these circum stances would be a highly hazardous undertaking, and most foreigners who know Germany well declaie categoi ically that until the food situation has been improved, war must be out of the question. Fourthly, the morale of the population leaves much to be desired. There is no doubt that Herr Hitler could launch a war, and that the people would not refuse to march; but there is not the enthusiasm which there was in 1914, and though initial successes might rally the population to the Government, most observers are agreed that in the event of a long war it is almost certain that we should witness a repetition of the events of 1918. 19928-2 u 94 In September last the Higher Command, the heads of the Nazi party, the industrialists, and the population at large were strongly against embarking on war—not because they disliked the idea of war itself, but because they thought that they would lose it. Field-Marshal Goring volunteered to the Roumanian Minister that although Germany would be beaten, she would do enough damage to bring Europe down in ruins. Germany has not since then so improved her ^ position as to render victory likely now. On the contrary, the prospects of a ^ knock-out blow against England have enormously decreased. (B) Italy. Italy’s economic position is thoroughly bad if not yet desperate. lor some years past the balance of payments has been unfavourable, with the result that Italy has already been forced to mobilise and dispose of all realisable “ Devisen assets. The stage has now been reached when, despite a rationing of imports which has reduced stocks to negligible proportions (except petroleum), it has been necessary to draw on the slender gold resources of the Bank of Italy. This position is the more serious because, apart from aluminium and mercury, Italy is almost entirely dependent on imports for her supplies of raw materials. In a good year Italy is more or less self-supporting in food-stuffs, but a slight drop in tiie crops would necessitate corresponding imports. Internally the budget has not been balanced for many years, and it has been necessary to have resort to three capital levies; this method of meeting the country’s financial needs cannot be continued indefinitely; taxes are already high, and, combined with a steady rise in prices, have led to a lowering of the general standard of living and some consequent discontent among the poorer and middle classes. The industrialists are also dissatisfied with the present situation. Apart from any question of war, it is not certain that Italy can continue her present policy indefinitely without bringing about an economic collapse or such a deterioration in the standard of living as might endanger the regime. Industrially, Italy is a second-class Power, and in a long war she would be incapable by herself of keeping a large army in the field; there would probably be an acute shortage of raw materials and there would be an insufficient supply of skilled labour. Italy would thus have to look to her allies for raw materials and munitions and be able to supply little in return. Italy claims to be able to put 8 million men in the field, but, of course, only a proportion of these could be front line troops, and, as indicated above, Italy would not, in fact, be able to sustain a large military effort against a first-class Power. The army may be fairly efficient, but its military value cannot be judged by its successes in Abyssinia, Albania and Spain; considerable defects in organisa tion were revealed in September 1938, but these may have been remedied. The air force is adequate, but not all the pilots reach a high standard of efficiency and reserves of aircraft are low. The navy is probably also adequate, although certainly not strong enough to stand up to the naval forces of Great Britain and France. Italy is far more open to attack than Germany. In a war against the Western Powers the position in East Africa, Libya and the Dodecanese would be5 extremely precarious, and the only industrial areas in Italy are concentrated in the north within easy range of aircraft from the south of France. Signor IMussolini’s pro-German policy is intensely unpopular in Italy, where the Germans are feared and disliked, and the people are unquestionably feeling the effects of four and a half years of intense strain. They are certainly very ^strongly opposed to the idea of being led into another war. Though it cannot be 'aid that the Fascist regime is in any danger of immediate collapse, there is at present much discontent and criticism of the regime and even of Signor Mussolini himself It would be unwise to assume that the Italians would not march if Signor Mussolini gave the order, but it is certain that there would be no enthusiasm at all, and this would be particularly true of war in support of - German claims. rr I or all these reasons, Italy as an ally is likely to be more of a burden than a help. (C) Japan. J a pan has now been engaged for nearly two years in hostilities in China, winch, it they have made comparatively little impression upon her resources of man-power and material, have brought about no solution of her problems and have imposed a serious dram upon her economy. Her army supports over a o n min 0n T 11 l i nder a ™ s ove 1 rs f a i her nav y has the task of trying to blockade over 2,000 miles of coast line, while her air forces are active in harassing the enemy. I his does not mean that her fighting forces would be incapable of extending the sphere of their activity, but it does mean that a proportion of them remains anchored to the task in hand, and that task is by no means completed. In the munitions industries production has not increased by more than 20 per cent between the outbreak of hostilities and the end of 1938. It is true that Japan’s industries were almost on a war footing some time before 1937, but there are certain limiting factors to the expansion of production, particularly in the metal and machine industries. These depend upon skilled labour, which cannot be provided quickly, and upon the importation of raw materials and manufactured goods which must be paid for out of Japan’s limited stock of foreign exchange. Ineie is evidence that Japan is already functioning at approximately the maximum capacity for war purposes, and that despite great efforts this canacitv I s only slowly increased. On the other hand, there is also evidence that in 1938-39 production m munitions was not keeping pace with requirements and the army had to draw on reserve stocks. The extent of these stocks and the rapidity with which they would be exhausted in the event of a major war is proDiGniciLiCciJ.. In the past year, despite the fact that Japan progressively strengthened the htate control of her_ national economy, there was a progressive' weakening of her financial position in the international account. Given, however, that her expendituie of mateiial and her importations do not exceed their present level and that her present apparently complacent acceptance of the steady diminution m her gold resource^ continues undiminished, she may be able to continue the present struggle m China for another two or three years, always provided thatshe is not subjected to pressure from outside. In this period of two or three years it is essential that she should be able to proceed unhindered to the development of the resources of the regions she has occupied, if she is to extricate herself successfully from her present economic difficulties. It will therefore be seen that the margin by which Japan may yet hope to achieve success in China is a narrow one and that there are factors which may tend to upset her plans. In fact, there seem to be recent indications that she is more anxious about the future than the above estimate of her position would lead one to assume. To extend the zone of hostilities and to increase her economic commitments would endanger her position still further. As regards morale, the Japanese people have been undergoing considerable emotional strain for nearly eight years, and that strain has been intensified during the past two years. They are a people of brief enthusiasms, and there seems to be evidence that the proportion of the population which is heartily sick of war, and which would view any extension of it with the utmost dismay, is steadily increasing. This is not to say that the people would not obey if they were directed to engage in war with any additional Power or Powers. But it does mean that there is a gradual weakening of the will to fight, and consequent decline in the prestige of the military extremists. In any hostilities which she might contemplate in the south, Japan could not for one moment afford to disregard the U.S.S.R., with whom she is on the worst possible terms, and at times in open, if limited and local, conflict. A certain proportion of her naval, military and air forces would therefore always have to be kept in reserve, even should Russia remain neutral, and the proportion (at any rate of military and air forces) would have to be vastly increased in the event of war. . The attitude of America, to whom Japan sends a large proportion ot her exports and upon whom she is dependent for certain imports, would be bound to have an overwhelming influence on Japanese policy. Unprovoked aggression in the south would result, at the least, in the loss of American friendship, and Japan cannot rule out the possibility of actual hostile action. The result of a conflict with the democratic Powers would therefore be a total loss of trade (including essential supplies of oil and rubber and certain metals) with those countries, and probably with America, and the dispersal of Japanese forces to such an extent that it would be difficult for her to achieve more than local or tactical successes. As against that, her possible allies, Germany and Italy, while they might contain for a time forces otheiwise destined for the Far East, could be expected to render no material assistance, nor to replace the trade and raw material lost to Japan by her conflict with the democracies.Infn.

Following point may be of use in arguments regarding the capacity of Germany to hold out against economic blockade, even if Poland and Roumania were overrun 0 During the last year of the Great War Germany had at her disposal the whole of Eastern Europe from Finland to the Adriatic and Dardanelles together with Belgium, Northern France, the Ukraine and the greater part of the Ottoman Empire. This vast area nevertheless proved insufficient to sustain her in the face of the British blockade., This argument will shortly be elaborated in pamphlet or article form with full statistics., Please repeat to Katmandu 07 |h&gt;o FOREIGN OFFICE, S. .V. 1. 30th August, 1939. /C)e^ ( Here are the books about which I spoke to you on the telephone.

(P 3667/1/150) The ^' ov/e r of the Br itish Royal Navy . Many unsuccessful atterapts have been made by ill-disposed persons to write down the power and efficiency of the Royal Navy. Such attempts were bound to fail, for they were not based on fret, and their allegations and insinuations can so easily be disproved by anyone who cares to look at the facts for himself. To begin with, the total tonnage of ships in commission in the Royal Navy amounts to a figure approximately equal to the total tonnage of German, Italian and Japanese fleets combined. If it is said that a percentage of this tonnage is over-age, such a statement means little or nothing except in relation to the same percentage in other fleets. In any case, a glance at the records reveals the enormous naval construction programme at present being completed in British shipyards, totalling on the 1st July, 1939, 712,000 tons of new construction - a figure far in excess of the construction put in hand by any other naval Power. A large number of these new' vessels is due to be launched and completed w r ithin the next few weeks and months. Consider the position in the current financial year 1939-40. Ba ttl eships, xwo vessels ol 35,000 tons with I4' f guns (of the 1936 programme) HMvL 3King George V and Prince of Wales were/were launched early in 1939 and will be completed next year. Another battleship of the same class (of the 1937 prograrane) T)uke__qf York will be launched by Her Kajesty the f.ueen on September 16th. The two remaining 35,000 ton battleships of the 1937 programme H.!.. Jellicoe and H.LuS. Beattv will toe launched shortly aftero Meanwhile the 30,000 ton battleship H.Ii.O. li'arsnj te (with eight 15' guns) completed her modernization in 1937 and has been entirely re-engined and re-boilered. Anti-aircraft armour and protection wa£ very greatly increased and hangars and catapults were added to enable her to accomodate three to four aircraft. The sane process of complete modernization is toeing carried out on her sister ships Valiant (to be completed January, 1940,) and Queen Elizabeth (to be completed toy the middle of 1940) Battlecruisers. The complete modernization of H.If.S. Rennl se and mii-.S. Henown, thirty knot battlecruisers of 32,000 tons mounting eight 15' guns, has also been carried out. These vessels are to all intents and purposes new ships and it may be noted that on the modernization of H.K.3. Renown as much as £3,088,008 we« spent as compared with an original cost of £3,117,204. These two vessels form part, with the 42,000 ton battlecruiser H.K.3. Hood, of the battlecruiser squadron of the Home Fleet. In addition to these new vessels the construction of four 40,000 ton battleships mounting 16' guns is progressing well. Air-craftIn April 1939 the 23,000 ton aircraft carrier — «. Illust rious (of the 1936 programme) was launched and Air-craft Carriers * her sister-ship in the same programme FoI hOr, Vict orious will he launched on September 14th,' a^d both these ships will be completed next year. Of the two aircraft carriers of the same class laid down under the 1937 programme the 23,000 ton -it-iLi F ormic able was launched by Lady 7/cry a, wife of the 3cretary of State for Air on August 17th and H .II. S. Indomitable 3 due to be launched, early next year. The construction of yo other aircraft carriers of the same tonnage is progressing, raisers. The last two of the ten 10,000 ton cruisers of the Southampton' class mounting 6 ,; guns HoIi. Sc Edinburgh F .L.S.

I'L O, Trinidad is due to be unched in September. Four further cruisers of the same ass H.IT.Sc Gambia, Jamaica, Ceylon and Uganda will be unched next year and four others are nrojected. It should be added that the modernization of the 10,000 n 8' gun cruisers HO' Sc London and K. ILS. Australia will completed in several months' time.

Char.ybdis in January 1940 and that of H.M.S. Scy11a a little later. Destroyers. Sixteen destroyers of the 'J' and 'K'' Class (l,590 tons mounting 4.7'' guns) have or will have joined the fleet by the end of tile year, eight destroyers of the “L' Class (l,930 tons) will be completed next year and sixteen further destroyers of the K and 'L' classes will be completed in 1940-1.

Twenty mine-sweeping trawlers of modern construction will he ready early next year, while sixty-seven others have been purchased by the Admiralty and ' are being converted and fitted for mine- sweeping and anti submarine duties. Ten Motor Torpedo Boats have or will have joined the Fleet by the end of the year. In conclusion some mention should be made of the Reserve Fleet which was fully manned on the 31st July and brought into full commission within a few days. The main units of this are: rne &lt;;y,uou ton Battle giiMt? inu unt i ng guns, the aircraft carrier H^M.S.
