It is, as Mr. Baggallay says, a little strange that the Sultan should be buying military equipment otherwise than through ourselves at the present moment, but the explanation may be that he has got a number of old Martini-Henri rifles for which he desired to get ammunition quickly. You will see from the list flagged at P.Z. 5252 that he has a number of old rifles of different kinds. If you agree, I would propose to inform Mr. Baggallay that we have no objection to his proposed reply to the French Government.

Gp.685(S 6248/6248/91) 3rd September, 1939, Dear Peel, Roche, of the French Embassy, called here on the 1st September in order to tell me that a French firm had received an enquiry for 40,000 'chargeurs” from the Sultan of Muscat. I understand that a 'chargeur' is a clip for pressing cartridges into a rifle, but it was not entirely clear whether, in this case, the 'chargeurs' were to be complete with ammunition or not. Anyhow, 30,000 of the clips were to fit Martini-Henri rifles and 10,000 7 m. m. rifles. 2. The French Government wished to know whether His Majesty^ Government saw any objection to the supply of this material. 3. I think that, if you see no objection, we ought to say that we are most grateful to the French Government for bringing this request to our notice, and that, for LUTTER I our part, we have no objection to the purchase going through. 4,8 ) 4. It seems a little strange that the Sultan should he buying military equipment otherwise than through ourselves, especially in view of the fact that he is expecting to get a good deal of material from us free. But the French Government are always a little suspicious where Muscat is concerned; this enquiry is therefore all the stranger an instance of good will, and if we can avoid raising difficulties I feel it would be politic to do so.

The Sultan will probably leave England next Monday, and if possible, we should like to have the estimate before he leaves.

The Government of India, after taking expert advice, were of the opinion that the existing guns of the Corps should, as funds permitted, be replaced by Vickers guns. The Commandant of the Corps, however, for the reasons mentioned in his letter Ho. 460/A-4, dated 1st February 1933, a copy of which I enclose, considers that the Vickers - Berthier machine Rifle would be the most suitable type for the present purpose. I would be grateful if the Government of India would obtain expert advice on the Vickers - Berthier Machine Rifle, and its suitability of the purpose for which it is required at Muscat* Should the expert opinion - which possibly Army Headquarters in India could supply - be favourable I would request that the Inuia Office may kindly be asked to issue the necessary export license direct to the manufacturers, Messrs Vickers Armstrong and Co.

Berth&amp; 6 r iaachine Rifle • Please refer to your Bo. C/60, dated 29th of Feoruary 1932. 2. In the enclosure to this letter the Government of India, after taking expert advice, were of opinion that the existing kachine guns belonging to tnis Corps should be replaced as funds permit by Vickers guns which are less likely to give trouble. This was also my opinion at that time. 3. The armament of the Levy Corps is now about to receive an addition in the shape of an Armoured Motor Lorry which is being constructed at Messrs Herman and kohatta’s Vi/orks, Karachi. 4. After taking expert advice and after correspondence with Messrs Vickers Armstrong .Ltd., the armament manufacturers etc., I consider that the best weapon, from all points of view, with which to equip the above Armoured Lorry will be tne Vickers-Berthfer kachine rifle. In the words of the makers 'the Vickers-Berthier Machine rifle is as reliable as the Vickers R.C. Class C. Machine gun and more reliable than the Lewis gun.' It may also be added that it is cheaper than either of the above, weighs only 20 pounds ana can be used for single as well as continuous fire. 5. The price of the gun is £ 60 to which must be added cost of spare parts and tools £ 14, 20 extra magazine £ 19-10-0, canvas case £ 1-5-0. Total cost will, therefore, be £ 94-15-0 which is less than the price at which our .Lewis gun was purchased. 6. Messrs Vickers will be able to effect despatch of the above gun in 4/5 weeks from receipt of order. 7. If,therefore, there is no objection I would be glad if Government could be approached for permission both for export of the Berthier Machine rifle from England and its import into Muscat as soon as possible.Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.

It will have the further advantage that spare parte sre and will be for considerable period easily available in India. If, however, the gun is only to be carried in the lorry and will normally be fired from the ground and may have to be carried considerable distances by hand, the Vickers-Berthier would prove uaore suitable for the purpose. 3, The above may be explained to the Muscat State authorities ana they may be asked to say which of the two types of guns would meet their requirements.

Sir, In continuation of letter from the Government of Indie, in the Foreign and Political Department No.F.35-N/31 dated the 19th November 1931, I am directed to refer to paragraph 10 (a) of Major Howie’s letter No.638-3 of 1931, dated the 2nd October 1931, and to say that the Government of India after taking expert advice are of opinion that in order to simplify training one type of gum should be used, and that the existing guns should be replaced, as funds permit, by Vickers guns as the latter are less likely to give trouble. One or more of the old Maxim guns might hov/ever be retained for drill purposes. 2. The Government of India also approve of the arrangement suggested in paragraph 10 (d) of Major Fowls’s letter and instructions to comply with telegraphic indents are being issued to the Officer in Charge, Ordnance Depot, Karachi. Bulk supply (say every six months) is ho.ever the most economical arrangement and v/ith a regular turnover of unit stocks the risk of deterioration is negligible. I have the honour to be, He., (Sd.)

Arms and Ammunition (paragraph 19 of my letter). From Captain Alban’s report it appears that the present arms and ammunition of the Corps are as follows:- Bifles Ammunition Maxim guns. Lewis guns Mark YII. Mark VI. Mark VII. .iark VI *3 1 40 xllO 41,000 73,000 * * rniot 2 as previously reported. x Captain Alban does not mention how many Mark VI there are but as the Corps normal strength is 150, presumably it is the balance between that number and 40. (a) Captain Alban agrees that the Maxim guns are old and should be rerjlaced as funds permit. As replacement he suggests 4 Vickers Maxims. On grounds of economy, portability, and uniformity of armament necessary in such a small Corps, I would suggest an equivalent number of Lewis guns instead of the Vickers Maxims. I suggest that the raison d’etre, etc., of the Corps might be explained to the General Staff, who perhaps v:ould be good enough to give the benefit of their advice on this point, which of course is a technical one. (b) Rifles. Captain Alban also agrees that the Corps should be rearmed with the Mark VII rifle as funds permit. (c. Ammunition. Captain Alban’s estimates for the Corps are as follows:- Mark VII Maxim Gun reserve of 10,000 per gun for 3gurE - 30,000 ” ’’ Levri. s ” ” ” 5,000 ” ” ” 1 ’’ - 5,000 ” ” Rifles ” ” 200 ”riQs fr40rifles - 8.000 43,000 ” M Maxim Gun Practice ” 1,000 ” gun for 3 guns 3,000 ” Lewis ” ' ” 1,000 ” ” ” 1 1,000 ” Rifles ” ” 100 n riQ.e fcr 40 rifles 4,000 51,000 In hand 41,ooo To be purchased 10,000 Cost = 1,060 Captain Alban recommends for financial reasons that the purchase/2 . purchase he made next year and not this. I concur. MARK. .1. As already noted the balance is 73,000. Captain Alban states that the average consumption per annum on Range Practice will be 7,000 and so no further stock: is required, nor is it advisable to try to obtain more of this ammunition as it is old and the proportion of misfires is high. I concur. (d) On the general subject of the supply of ammunition Captain Alban points out that it is better to keep small stocks and replenish often, than to keep large ones, as local climatic conditions lead to rapid deterioration. He suggests that some organization is necessary whereby on despatch of a.telegram, say, to ^uetta Arsenal, ammunition could in an emergency be despatched immediately and formalities completed later. Supplies would reach Muscat still quicker from Karachi, and if Government approve the military authorities might be approached. /fz rrw Extract from Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No.487-S of 1931, dated the 1st August 1931. 19. Arm d Armament . The Levy is at present armed with tv^o makes of rifles - 40 modern S.M.L.E. and the remainder old non charger loading magazine Lee Enfields. Uniformity is obviously necessary and as funds permit the Levy should be re-armed with the newer weapon and also have a sufficient reserve of ammunition for emergencies and musketry training. The Levy also has the following machine guns:- 2. Maxim guns. 1. Lewis gun. The former are reported to be of T, very doubtful efficiency”, and if so should presumably be returned to store and new ones purchased as funds permit. The amount allowed under 'Arms and Ammunition' Rs.1,300 is obviously inadequate to provide for any sort of re-armament, as well as to build up a reserve of ammunition, but I suppose this i all that is available for the moment.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100036337484.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2195/1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100036337484.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2195/1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 7/27 'Muscat: supply of a Vickers-Berthier Machine Rifle to Muscat State; supply of guns and ammunition to Sultan'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1940</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-09-28T00:15:11</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 item (98 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence regarding requests for weapons and ammunition, received from Sa'īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa'īd, the Sultan of Muscat.
