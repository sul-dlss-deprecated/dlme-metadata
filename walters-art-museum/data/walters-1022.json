Four plumes rise from a circlet atop his short wig, and a protective uraeus (sacred cobra) rises from his brow. The god wears a long, sheer, patterned garment, a divine beard, a wesekh, or beaded broad collar, and a necklace with a shrine-shaped pendant. A portion of the hand and scepter of another divine figure remain behind Onuris-Shu. The inscriptions suggest that the relief was once part of a scene of adoration.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1925", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/8004", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris, [date of acquisition unknown], by purchase [as from temple near Suez];  Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1925, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.\r\n", "Dynasty": "Ptolemaic Dynasty", "Reign": "Ptolemy II Philadelphos", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.033", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_22.120_Fnt_BW.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_22.120_Fnt_BW.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_22.120_Fnt_BW.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_22.120_Fnt_BW.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_22.120_Fnt_BW.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1544287", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL7_22.120_Fnt_BW.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Lobby"}
