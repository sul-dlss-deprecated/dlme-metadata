Your telegram No. 482-S., dated August 2nd. Have modified portion? ot mv letter regarding money and tea accordingly. Zair Khidar s consignment of tea is 197 chests and 20 double chests and value is estimated at 9,660 tomans and duty at 2,500 tomans. In regard to this duty (unless we connive at Zair Khida* smuggling consignment again) we can either (1) pay it ourselves, or (2) ^k Persian Government to authorise entry free of duty. In view of fact that but for our having seized it the tea would have been smuggled into Persia months ago and of fact that these negotiations have been necessitated by impotence of Pei sic n Government, I think latter course might be adopted and Persian Governmen requested to authorise admission of consignment free. I am according y addressing His Majesty’s Minister on the subject.Telepram R.No.1557, dated the 27th (received 28th) July, 1916. From - Tlie Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To - The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreifm and Political Department, Simla. Ahram.-Zair Khidar delayed more than a week before answering my first letter saying that I had been authorised to negotiate for release of prisoners and suggesting that an exchange between them and Tangistani prisoners might be effected on a certain date. He now writes W A11 we wrote said and asked general reconciliation has been productive of no result. Now, indeed, I do not believe anything can be settled with you. I say to myself that if I continue negotiations they may produce no result. It would be better for me to wait and put my trust in God and remain hoping in Him'. This is not very promising; I have replied that during period mentioned I was not authorised to negotiate whereas I now am, and I hope some result will be reached. 2. Letter received from O’Connor stating that r r.Christmas is very ill indeed. Rave written to Zair Khidar urging him to release Christmas without prejudice to other negotiations and guaranteeing to release two Tangistani prisoners in exchange;^also pointed out what serious matter it would be if illness had fatal results.

From—The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Basrah, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. My telegram No. 1557. Reference second paragraph. I received very insolent reply from Sheikh Hussein absolutely declining to exchange Christmas and saying that only way to obtain release of prisoners (other than by killing Sheikh Hussein and all hi9 people) is—(1) by returning cash and tea confiscated ; (2) giving assurances re road. 2. Reference paragraph one, received letter from O’Connor last evening saying that he had seen my letter of July 15th to Zair Khidar suggesting exchange of prisoners and that latter was quite willing to exchange provided of course that his other two conditions of restoration of cash and tea and assurance about opening the road are complied with. In view of fact that whole object of negotiations is to get prisoners away out of the heat quickly, it seems useless to make further delay by haggling. It is also undignified in view of the fact that Khans are set on getting their conditions and in the end we shall have to concede them if we wish to get prisoners out soon. I propose therefore to reply to Khans on following lines : if the Khans agree to exchange prisoners on certain date, I will have Tangistani prisoners at spot fixed and agree to make following concessions in addition. As regards confiscated cash, I will produce Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar’s receipt showing that amount (10,000 tomans) which was confiscated when in deposit with him has been refunded. We however reserve the right to claim from Sheikh Hussein the sum of about 2,500 tomans, which was paid out in compensation to sufferers in the raids last August. As regards tea, it is deposited in Bushire Custom House godowns and a certificate to that effect from Director will be produced. As regards opening the road, after exchange of prisoners all prohibitions against the use of any road will be withdrawn. So will restrictions by sea except customs preventive work. Traffic across Mashileh will be permitted during day and will be regulated by military. Khans, for their part, should give facilities for repairing telegraph lines, and if these not given within, say, 15 days, or if lines again cut after repair, we reserve right to close road again. Similarly in the case of robberies or disturbances taking place on road or mis behaviour of tribes. This, I suggest, might he offered to Khans on a “ take it or leave it ” basis, though perhaps the tea being in custom house would be stumbling block and might require modification.

In continuation of this office endorsement No. 205 C, dated 19th June 1916, and with reference to subsequent telegraphic correspondence, I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a draft telegram to Minister from Lieutenant-Colonel O’Connor, dated Ahram, June 24th, received here on the 27th idem. As the Minister’s mind is already made up in the sense desired by Colonel O’Connor and as it has been decided by the Government of India to present their views regarding negotiating with the hostile Khans afresh to His Majesty’s Government, it did not seem to me that any useful purpose would be served by sending this telegram to the Minister, and I shall not do so unless Sir P. Cox thinks it advisable. A copy has also been sent to Sir P. Cox, Political Resident, Persian Gulf. p. Since writing the above, another draft telegram from Colonel O’Connor, dated 26th June, has been received this morning, 29ih idem. I propose to treat it the same way. It is perhaps unnecessary for me to comment on it beyond observing that— (1) I am not conscious of having threatened the Khans beyond remark ing in a letter some time ago that if they did not exchange the prisoners it would be the worse for them : this I did by authority. (2) It was Colonel O’Connor himself who first mooted the question of escaping and of seizing the fort of Ahram. Enclosure No, I. To Major Trevor (in invisible ink). Many thanks for your letter of 17th. We are always glad of new*. Will you please send attached to Minister? Telegram S. D. to Minister, Tehran : .. Ahram, 24th June, to Minister, Tehran. Reference previous corre spondence. After the despatch of my telegram of 11th June to you, Khan approached me again with fresh proposals for settlement which 1 duly com municated to Major Trevor for submission to you. These proposals were on the same lines as those previously submitted and explicitly excluded any request for assurance. 1 presume, therefore, that you will b e prepared toeffect settlement on these lines but as I have received no message from you or any intimation as to what your views are or whether any negotiations are in progress with Khans with object of effecting our release I venture to address you again in hope that you may be able to effect speedy settlement. In case any difficulty should arise over question of reopening main road and resumption of traffic between Bushire and neighbouring districts or any other matter, I venture to suggest that Acting Resident should be instructed to avoid as far as possible entering into question of detail. It appears to me that all that is called for now is assurance that when prisoners have been exchanged and normal relations resumed traffic will, of course, be opened as before by all roads. I venture to add that conditions of life here in heat now prevailing are almost intolerable. Two members of our party, Mr. Smith and Mr. Christmas, are in very feeble health and are daily growing weaker. In my opinion and in that of doctor they cannot possibly support this life much longer. Doctor himself too is in bad state of health and is just now incapacitated by severe attack of fever. As no doubt you are aware Mr. Pettigrew died on 27th April in circumstances which I shall report to you later. “ We would none of us complain of any hardships to which we were subiected if our detention here was really necessary or could in any way he regarded as being of service to our country. But we feel that on tne contrary our indefinite retention by this petty Khan within thirty miles of Bushire is not only useless from point of view of interests of Great Britain but is actively prejudicial to our national prestige. « Both on personal and on general grounds, therefore, I venture again to urge upon you 1 desirability of terminating this intolerable situation as soon as ^° Sslble - O’Connor.” Received, Bushire, 27th June 1916.

You no doubt understand that our authorities at Bushire have placed themselves in a false position by repeated threats of vengeance on Khans which they have been unable to fulfil and they are now naturally reluctant to tive way to Khans in any matter. But as apparently military authorities Lave definitely refused to employ force, only course left is to make best terms possible. I venture again to urge, therefore, that if you consider our release desirable you will express your views plainly to Bushire authorities and instruct them to effect settlement as soon as possible. Major Trevor has not given me any information regarding your views nor as to negotiations which he is ap parently conducting with Khans, but he constantly urges us to try and escape which course besides being extremely risky is impracticable for certain members of party, and we do not propose to attempt it especially in view of situation in rest of Persia. Enclosure No. 3. Translation of a letter from Colonel O’Connor written in Persian, dated Ahrano, the 2Gth June, received Bushire, the 29th June 1916. Dear Trevor, I request that you will immediately send to Minister in Tehran telegram to following effect:— “ S. D., dated Abram, 26th June, to the British Minister, Tehran. The Khan has informed me that a reply has come from M ajor Trevor and that they have accepted for an exchange of prisoners to take place and return of confiscated goods or the value of them, but that the matter of the opening of the road between this Vilayet and the Shahi road must be held over till the prisoners have been exchanged. The Khans do not accept this and more than that the exchange of the prisoners should take place they desire to have assurances that the road shall be opened. I hope that you will agree to give such an assurance immediately to the Chiefs and telegraph necessary instruo - tions to Bushire as quickly as possible.

This renders the n fairly well off as regards supplies. As regards newspapers, Wassmuss developed a passion for censorship cutting out large portions of most of the papers; he went so far as to cut out a paragraph from the “ Lancet ” which had been sent to Hr. Azzopardy by the Residency Surgeon, because a remark was made that a British substitute for some German drug had been found ! Still, apparently the prisoners receive a good proportion of the newspapers and periodicals sent out, and the last batches of papers were not sent to Wassmuss. The bad accommodation and the excessive heat at Abram, combined of course with the fact of being in captivity, seem to be the worst things wita which the prisoners have to contend. Reports from all sides tend to show that the hostile Khans and the people of Tangistan are getting very bard hit by the cessation of intercourse with Bushire, and all indications seem to point to the fact that, if we do not forestall them by accepting their terms, the Khans will have to accept our terms before long. Dr. Azzopardy proposes to leave for Europe by the mail which takes this letter. A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Enclosure, Statement of Dr, E, Azzopardy t M.D, Edgard Azzopardy, M.D., lately Doctor to the Indo-European Telegraph Department, Shiraz, states :— I was going on leave to Europe last November with a view to offering my services as a medical man to Government, when I was arrested by the Gendar merie at Dehbid and sent back. I got back to Shiraz towards the end of November. On arrival I was taken before Wustrow, the German Consul, who told me I must wait a few days till it was decided what was to be done with me. Two days after I was taken before Wustrow again and he said “ O’Connor is very ill at Borasjun and you must go and attend him ”. I said all right; I was sent down to Borasjun under a Gendarme escort. On arrival at Borasjun I saw the Shiraz Consulate sowars there and they said the Consul was not there. Afterwards the Gendarmerie officer said the Consul was at Ahram and I must go there the next day. I accordingly went there under escort of Gendarmes. I arrived there on the 9th December. On arrival I saw the fort and as 1 came up I saw Wassmuss. He said *‘ You are Dr. Azzopardy ? I said “Yes”. He said “You are my prisoner, come inside”. I replied “ Very good there are 8 here, I sh^U be the 9th ”, I found Colonel Q’Cqunor was not ill. At Ahram I found we were in charge of Zair Khidar Khan. He was kind to us in his own way and treated us well. The prisoners, Colonel O’Connor, Mr. Ferguson, Mr. Smith, Mr. Christmas, Mr. Tettigrew, Mr. Ayrton, Mr. Livingstone and Mr. Misso were in the Kala Kaiat, a building with 2 rooms and a small compound only about 12 yards square. Wassmuss has his headquarters at the Balakhana-i-Nao on the other side of the town about 5 minutes’ walk away. I found that stores and pro visions and newspapers were being received from Bushire. The newspapers were censored by Wassmuss and large portions cut out. All boxes of stores were opened for inspection by Wassmuss. Most of items arrived all right, occasionally a tin of cigarettes or a box of biscuits were taken out. He got practically all the things however. We had to live in great discomfort with no proper cook and very bad food. In the spring there was a tremendous plague of flies, fleas mosquitoes, sand flies and bats. There were also a good many snakes about. When the hot weather really set in, these pests dis appeared. During April the Khan was very kind. On the 22nd of April Pettigrew was taken ill when going to the closet. I was called and rushed down and found he had an attack ot angina pectoris and w^as unconscious. I revived him, and ordered him, to refrain from smoking and put i.lum on diet.8 , , . j nffqnlc On the morning of the 27th April On the 23rd he had an i - o hoard that some sort of advance was being we heard the sound o d e 0 g ^V e were s hut up in mad e from They told us the Khan ha^.^ cam(; to t Kala l ^ ahouUO-30 m 11 a m., and said that we would have to be shot and they would off to the hills. He said that Colonel O’Connor would be shot first and the 8 . and then they would go off to the hills. It had always been t'he idea of the Khlns to take us off to hills if the British troops came as they knew that they could not resist them. Afterwards we were in our rooms. I was Kin- on my bed. Pettigrew was lying on his bed reading a book in the othe room At about 2-30 I was hastily called by the others who said PettLieThad had another attack. I rushed in and found him already dead. He undoubtedly died of angina pectoris. Possibly the fright lie had m the morninf may ’have induced another attack. We buried Pettigrew about 5 o’clock the same day outside the fort. After this nothing much ot interest happened All the party suffered from diarrhoea and disorder of the bowels in the spring but afterwards got better. Messrs. Livingstone, Ayrton and Misso have kept fairly well the whole time. I suffered a good deal trom lever and nervous excitement. Eventually I had a very sharp attack about the 26th of June and Zair Khidar Khan thought I was going to die and so he wrote to Sheikh Hussain suggesting 1 should be released. Sheikh Hussain agreed and I was released on 28th June. X left the next day under escort for Ali Changi and came on from there yesterday arriving here last night. When I left Colonel O’Connor, Messrs. Ferguson, Livingstone, Ayrton and Misso were quite well, Mr. Smith and Mr. Christmas were not in good health. Mr. Smith is suffering from weak heart and congestion of the veins. Mr. Christmas is suffering from progressive atrophy : he is like a skeleton. It would be good thing to exchange them, but the Khan will not, I think, let them go separately. The'khan (Zair Khidar) is very friendly indeed just now. He hopes to get an answer about opening the road and exchange of prisoners. The day I left an emissary from Saulet-ud-Douleh arrived with the Khadkhuda of Semel to try and persuade the Khans to give us up. Zair Khidar did not seem likely to agree and said he would make his owm arrangements with the English. The Khans seem in a poor way now. Zair Khidar has not more than 50 men. Between him and Sheikh Hussain I do not think they could muster 100 or 120 men. Wassmuss has had no influence now for about a month or 6 weeks. There is a strong party against him at Ahram : about a month ago he was attacked in the Balakhana-i-Nao at Ahram and several shots fired at him one night. The people all round Ahram were quite friendly to the prisoners. They are heartily sick of the whole business. Before me, Btjshire ; 'k A. P.

Dr. Azzopardy arrived at the outpost line about 8 p.m. on the 30th June. A messenger from Ahram who had arrived on the 29th told me that Jr. Azzopardy wouii be coming in on that day or the next, but as Colonel O’Connor made no mention of it in the letters which the messenger brought, I did not credit the story. It appears that Dr.Azzopardy had two or three sharp at- tacks of ferar arrt as hs is an elderly man and very thin, he probably looked /ary ill and the Khans probably thought he might die and so agreed to send him in. On arrival here he had quite recovered from his fever and seemed his normal self.

On the 2nnd of April Pettigrew was taken ill when going to th3 oleast. 1 was called and rushed down and foiani he had an attack of Angina Pectoris and was unconscious.

On the morning of the 2?th April we heard the sound of guns and hear! that some sort of ad^ano?* was being made from Bushire. They told us the Khan had gone off. We were shut up in our rooms. The Khans Mirsa whose name I don’t know came to th e Kala at about 10.30 oi 11 a.m. and sail that we would have to be shot and they would go off to the hills, lie said that Colonel O’Oonnor would be r shot first and the rest afterwards and then they would go off tc the hills. It had always been the idea of the Khans to take us off to hills if the British troops came as they knew that they could net resist them. Afterwards we wore in our rooms.I was lying on my bed. Pettigrew was lying on his bed reading a book in the other room. At about 8.3Q I was hastily called by the others who said Pettigrew had had another attack. X rushed in and found him already dead. He undoubtedly died of Angina Pectoris. Possibly the fright he hod In the morning may have induced another attack, tie burrled Pettigrew about 3 o’clock the sarse day outside the fort.

Unfortunately one of Tangistani prisoners named Zair Hussain who had been sent to Bombay in error by Basra military authorities had not arrived, and the Khans were ratner incensed and insisted on keeping 0 T Connor pending his arrival.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Basrah, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated to Bushire). Please see telegram, 1442, of July 9th, from Bushire. The proper course in my judgment is that negotiations should now be left in the hands of the military authorities under direction of Army Commander, as the Tangistani prisoners for exchange are military prisoners some of whom are now at Basrah and others on the way here from India. From his personal knowledge of Persia and of situation the General Officer Commanding at Bushire, General Douglas, is fully qualified to conduct these negotiations and will be in constant touch with Deputy Resident. Seeing that we have 12 Tangistanis against 6 British prisoners I presume that negotiations will start with endeavour to secure simple exchange and gradually increase inducement if it is probably necessary —vide Army Com mander’s telegrams 3143 and 3187 to Chief of the General Staff. It would be convenient for us to he informed of views of Government of India referred to in Tehran telegram No. 94 of July 6th to Foreign Depart- meut.164 Telegram E., dated the 2nd (received 3rd) July 1916. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated to Minister, Tehran). I have received from Trevor the following telegram, No. 1358, with contents, of which I generally agree ‘.—Begins. I heg to make a few remarks on Minister’s telegram, No. 215. My reference to Baghdad ladies referred simply to fact that in my opinion they have had to put up with almost as bad climatic and other conditions as prisoners at Ahram and for a much longer time. If analogous case is required that of Solium prisoners is more to the point. They were captives of far more savage tribe and had to undergo far more severe sufferings. I am not aware that we negotiated with tribe for their release or offered concessions. From accounts in the press I gather that we simply bided our time and rescued them by a raid. Ahram prisoners, are fewer in number and much nearer. Points 1 and 3. I think I am justified in thinking that Khans would escape punishment. 2. It is to be hoped Germans, etc., will remain in confinement, but not (I think) certain. They are said to be living comfortably in one of Kawam’s gardens. 4. Khans are already having success with F(arman) F(arma)—especially Borasjun. 5. All I can say to this is we speak here from knowledge derived from daily correspondence. 6. Two Khans would recover ten thousand tomans and 30,0001b. tea, respectively, besides knowing their villages would not be destroyed. As for F(arman) F(arma) we know his expeditions : that in 1898 against Tangistanis, was a failure; Kesident, in Administration Keport of that year in reporting its return to Shiraz, states “ that little appears to have been effected as far as the punishment of Tangistanis is concerned”; and expedition in 1905 to punish Lurs who attacked Douglas and Lorimer did not achieve anything: I fancy it never entered country of brigands concerned. 5, 8 and 10. At least it seems unnecessary to make consequences of our inaction worse. I think Minister himself overlooked past history of Khan of Borasjun and of Tangistanis.

Out of the 10,000 tomans belonging to Sheikh Hussain which was depo sited with Rais-ut-Jujjar here and attached during occupation, about 2,000 were paid out to British subjects as compensation for horses and other property carried off by Sheikh Hussain’s raiding parties. Should I offer him balance remaining or return whole sum intact? In last letter Khans have not specifically mentioned assurances of pardon. Perhaps they think (and they would not in my opinion be far wrong if they do) that reopening of road and resumption of friendly relations with their tribesmen would preclude hostile action—or perhaps our (from their point of view) pusillanimous inaction here has induced such contempt for us that they think that they have nothing to fear from us. The Khans made such a point of pardon however until recently that I think that first alternative is correct one, though perhaps they will raise question again during negotiations.

They will not have much success with Persian Government, but they may do a little in way of exactions for time. 5. Not more so than by our persistent inaction. 6. I doubt it. Khans are making nothing out of their capture. I have also more faith than you in F(arman) F(arma) taking action against them. 7. I concur entirely. 8. We have got to bear consequences of our previous inaction even if it affects our police scheme. 9. Possibly for a time. 10. See 5 and 8. I think you are overlooking the circumstances attending the whole of the Pars question and are forgetting that movement against us was engineered by foreign agents who spent lavishly and was backed by gendarmerie.

A copy of a telegram from Sir Charles Marling containing his observations on the suggestions made by Sir P. Lake is also enclosed, herein, for the information of Mr. Secretary Chamberlain. Sir Edward Grey entirely concurs with the view expressed by Sir C. Marling to the effect that the present negotiations with the Khans should be con fined to the actual release of the British prisoners, and that no subsidiary questions should at present be introduced. He would therefore propose, if Mr. Chamberlain agrees, to request the War Office to inform Sir P.

Moreover, in order to effect the release of consul v/e may be obliged to give promise of indemnity to Khans but I gather that it is none the less desire of the Government of India and of His Majesty's Government that they shall not go scot free. It appears to me that (1) and (2) being- only remotely connected with Khans, other misdeeds will fairly provide'requisite pretext for action against them, whereas if they are now brought into discus- sion Khans will demand pardon in respect of them.

No effective action seems to have been taken bv 1 ersian Government, and our detention seems likely to continue indefinitely unless Your Excellency can devise some means for our release. Maiority of people here are heartily sick of whole business and will welcome settlement T venture to suggest that, if Persian Government are not in position to desnatch actual force to effect our release, they should at least deputeMamur to represent either Central Government or Soulet. Arrival of such individual here^oukl pioduce great effect and matters could certainly be arranged after few days’ negotiations probably on basis of simple exchange of prisoners. Failing this and assuming that Indian Government are not in position to employ force themselves, I suggest that matter should be treated as simple case If brigandage, and that we should be ransomed out of hands of brigands as has frequently had to be done in cases of British subjects held to ransom in other countries. Such course, however, undesirable from some points of view would surely be preferable to our indefinite detention here. As long as we are here this district remains focus for unrest and intrigue which infects all Southern Persia and it affords place of refuge for murderers and rebels; and continued detention of British Cousul and other British subjects by petty Khans actually within sight and hearing of Bushire must be increasingly^ prejudicial to our l’i' eSt | S f;, &lt; 1 nCe J e ■ ar ? f leaSed , these two Kbans 1,jSe all fictitious importance which they have derived from rebel movements in south, and can be easily dealt with in exemplary manner at any time later on when it suits us. ” Ends.

Trevor, C.T.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire, To—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran. My immediately preceding telegram. Secret portion of letter received this morning from O’Connor contained draft telegram sent herewith. I presume Farman Farma’s Deputy could send Mamur; if so, as O’Connor thinks, he might be useful perhaps you would arrange. There is no doubt inaction of our force here has a very bad effect, but in view of decision of Government there appears to be no help for it. I am writing to Zair Khidar requesting reply to my letter of May 4th in which I said I had been authorized to tell him that if he sent over the British prisoners, British authorities would release the Tangistanis now in confinement in exchange. Meanwhile I am communicating again with O’Connor secretly in regard to chance of prisoners being able to escape, as I believe Zair Khidar’s reason for not replying is that he wants an assurance of immunity from punishment. Addressed Minister; repeated Basrah.m ruiusai t)r renenfous iinans to releaso prisoners. If in Shiraz itself matters have not improved so far as could be wished it is because there was no Governor or Deputy Governor with sufficient authority to control local intrigues and jealousies but even so I have been able to secure re-arrest of the prisoners released by Soulet’s influence which shows that Government authority exists while since the arrival three days ago of jP(arman) E(arma) , s Deputy there is a change for the better though he came alone and without any kind of armed force. Even now I believe that British officers could travel with a very modest escort from Kerman to Shiraz by a more direct route than that suggested by Government of India or even from Bunder Abbas without any serious danger. It would be unnecessary for them to take money with them as I hope to see Imperial Bank of Persia reopon at Shiraz by time they could arrive. F(arman) E(arma) is quite confident that within two months of his arrival he will have province well in hand and I can (see ?) no reason to doubt it but he will have done it by usual undesirable Persian methods. Credit and prestige would be his and there would be no opportunity of military opera tions which the Government of India count upon to restore our prestige. Under the circumstances it seems to me that the risks forseen (by ?) Government of India are small and as compared with advantages to be gained may properly be taken.

He had formed this opinion on the evidence then before hirn,influenced mainly by consideration of the ignominy that is being suffered by Major O’Connor and his fellow prisoners, but with much hesitation and subject to the proviso that satisfactory guarantees should be forthcoming for the future proodgood conduct of the Khans. The cumulative effect of the weighty considerations stated in Major Trevor’s telegram is to suggest that any such guarantees given by the Khans in the circumstances are not likely to be of much value, and that there is considerable risk that misinterpretation of the action of H.M.G, may even lead to further disturbances. If this view is correct, the inference would be that the promise of pardon is not one that can safely be given, and the scope of the negotiations should not be wider than the basis approved in F.O. telegram No.235 op 17th May.

Cox telegraphs as follows :— our telegram 25 thJ.me Se ^ corres P on&lt;lence endi[ »S with Bushire telegram 1338, dated “ Perhaps the Government of India have the advantage of knowing what was t le precise material and records on which the Foreign Office and India Office based decision communicated in Minister’s telegram No 199 dated 17th June, to Bush,re. It may be that records before them only dealt with the isolated offences of hostile Khans m holding British subjects in open uire,t, and that previous enormities and depredations of the'said Khans were not fully taken into account. “ In any case their decision did not appear to contemplate even in last ieb.oi . ie £ lant of )7 any assurances of pardon, whether sincere or insincere, a course which His Majesty’s Minister now suggests apparently on his own authority. ^ J “ Briefly speaking the position is that the question of health and convenience of a small party of British subjects, possibly for a further three months during a time of war, when there are 4emied-?-^tate-iir) British prisoners in much worse plight has, or may ultimately, to be weighed agamst a serious blow to the national good name and influence of Great Britain in Pars and the Persian Gulf Ports. We shall be humiliated before oui friends. I o an extent the interests and prestige involved are the particular care and trust of the Government of India. His Majesty’s Legation, situated as it is in a different atmosphere and surroundings, is not and never has been fully able to appreciate them yet. His Majesty’s Minister is now disposing of them in direct communication with His Majesty’s Government. “ The Government of India will, I am sure, agree that it is due by them to those of its loyal servants who are devoting their health and energies to the maintenance of British prestige in the Gulf, and on whom the humiliation will fall, to make sure that before a decision is come to give any sort assurances of pardon to those rebel Khans. All the correspondence and the pros and cons, including Major Trevor’s present telegram, should be laid before His Majesty’s Government. “ Bushire being within the sphere of responsibility of General Officer Commanding of this force, and measures for its protection be taken from here, it will perhaps be considered whether the matter should not be placed before the War Committee. The prisoners are prisoners made by German enemies, and as Trevor remarks there seems no adequate reason why humiliating concessions should be made in their case than in that of the Baghdad ladies. “ P.S.—Before above was actually despatched, a copy of Minister’s telegram No. 215, of 2Gth June, has reached me, but as it does not cause me to modify my views on the main issues, and adds to my fears that all the pros and cons have not been before His Majesty’s Government, I see no reason to stop it. “ Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Teheran and Bushire.” fl' z/j-U. ^ 7 grV / J CVu-£, / C ^ teiUC-k238 No. 135 C., dated Bushire, the 4th (received 15th) May 1916.

(Repeated to Tehran, Bushire, Basra and Sykes.) 233 S. Secret. Keference to telegram from Tehran, 338 F., 16th May. Objection to sending British officers direct to Shiraz, as proposed by Farman Farma, appears to be as follows :—Adequate escort from Bunder Abbas Bushire is not available. Without escort officers would run a risk of being murdered or captured by isolated bandits or agents of hostile Khan. Such an event would increase our embarrassments, and eventually necessitate more extensive punitive operations in South Persia. Even [f officers reached Shiraz safely they could not well start Sykes’s police scheme there without explicit instructions from Sykes, and taking over so called loyal gendarmerie would, we think, be dangerous experiment. In any case force raised hastily in this fashion would hardly be competent to take action ^ against Kyauk-Myoung Khans without risk of reverse, which would tend to stdl further lower our prestige. We think best solution is that Soulet should in the meantime do what is possible to arrange for release of Shiraz prisoners ; that Sykes with his escort should proceed from Kerman to Shiraz as soon as possible ^that on): his arrival there further officers should be sent from Bunder Abbas if he can arrange safe conduct to raise Military Police under his orders at Shiraz, and that clearing of situation in Bushire Hinterland should be left to Force from Mesopotamia as soon as such is available.2 ■f m i&gt; i/ JJ T 83 Telegram R., No. 154—923, dated the 20th (received 21st) April 1916.

Have to-day received letter from O’Connor. April 17th, giving result of an interview with Zair Khadir and Shaikh Hussain at which latter made the following proposals ( 1 ) Immediate exchange of British prisoners against Tangistan prisoners. (2) Khans to give formal assurances of friendship to the British Govern ment in return for assurances of friendship from us. Their assurances to include promise to abstain from intrigues with German subjects or agents. (3) Shaikh Hussain’s money, which was attached, to be returned, also some smuggled tea belonging to Zair Khadir. (4) Shaikh Hussain asks that route via Ahbuti (Ahmadi ?) should be reopened. Khans add that they cannot give up Wassmuss as he has been their guest so long, but suggested (a) that he should be allowed to find his wav hack on the receipt of an assurance from us, or (b) failing such assurance, he should remain as their guest till end of war; in this ease they will give an assurance that he shall indulge in no further intrigues m propaganda. O’Connor adds that he ventures to note that settlement may be possible on these lines ; he has told Khans that he does not think we shall be able to give any assurance of safety to Wassmuss for his journey. I imagine second proposition will not commend itself to Government as it would result in Khans escaping ail punishment for their crimes. 1 is condition is no doubt crux of matter as far as Khans are concerned. I venture to think that it would be advisable to tell Khans that it they like to hand over British prisoners to us now, we will be pleased to release Tangistan Sners in exchange, but that if they do not do so, it will be worse tor thern ; that as they have been dismissed from their Khanships and outlawed by Persian Government as a result of their misdeeds, it is impossible for us to give them any assurances even if we desired to do so.

It is important that Russian Consul, who is considered to be quarrelsome and tactless, should not return to Kerman before British Consul. He is most anxious to start as soon as possible and is enquiring about our dates. If Cox approves, matter could perhaps be arranged by appointment of Howson to Kerman. He is liked by Persians, understands the complicated situation and is on the spot. With the sanction of the Chief of the General Staff and Cox, Withers could act for Howson. For political reasons it is most undesirable that the Russian Consul should accompany Mission which, owing to its size, must, moreover, move in two parties. Best plan would be for Russian Minister to instruct Russian Consul to start fortnight after Mission. It might perhaps be pointed out by Minister at Tehran that Mission moves slowly but that if Russian Consul passed it there might be risk of robbers. Addressed Foreign ; repeated Sir P.

Please refer to telegram 45 S. from Foreign Department. If Wassmuss is still there and has any authority, he will not agree to exchange any one but Listemann for O’Connor; he might possibly agree to exchange one of others, say Eerguson, for Eisenhut if Khans would let him. If, however, Wassmuss has disappeared (as rumour says), I think it is just as likely Khans would exchange O’Connor for Khalu (Zair ?) Hossein as for Eisenhut, in fact probably more likely as they care nothing for latter. There is possibility of our securing release, I think, if instead of remaining quiescent we show some sign of activity here.

Government of India 1ms consistently been opposed to operations by our troops inland so that in the ab sence of any intimation to the contrary and with the season advanced (Tbeyond the) time Indicated in Bushire telegram 179/1,032 I was forced to the conclusion that only instrument in our hands against Khans was Soulet- ed-Dowlah. Prospect of securing his assistance up to April 22nd. and even after seemed fair. It was clear ly in his interest to re-establish his loyalty in the eyes of the Persian Government and ourselves and he expressed his readiness to act. His attitude subsc- quently changed. (?Death) of Kawam gave him greater Importance: he saw his own Importance and began to bargain asking for £20,000 down before taking steps. Persian Government and all our friends here begged mo not to agree as they were convinced that he would take money and do nothing. The Chagedak raid and scuttling also confirmed him in this attitude as it led him o toto think that we had no serious intention of taking action ourselves: (gr* undecO again it came.to his knowledge that we knew of all his connexion the rehel Jians and he has now doubts of our attitude tov/ards hin^ Nor do the hostile khans themselves seem, to have been impressed by raid: all Persian opinion condemns it as a dangerous surrender and I have been asked whether the military authorities had no consideration for life of Consul. fj , r Strong line with true U- long as we had a (gr« undee undergoing but no longer.

If it fails and if His Majesty’s Government is not prepared to take adequate action at Bushire it appears to me we must either nego tiate with Khans and make considerable concessions or else resign ourselves to leaving captives in the hare * of Khans for the large part of the summer in circum stances of great hardship with no corresponding ao.vant- age to ourselves.

As events are moving so rapidly and favourably in South Persia, there seems some hope of our securing their release without any exchange.

Sir:- I should be most grateful if' you could inform me if any steps are being taken to release the dhiraz colony from their internment in Ahram. I have just landed in England from Bushire, having been sent from Shiraz to Ahram by the German Consul of Shiraz. Herr 'Wassmuss having no room for me (seeing that the prisoners had the only 2 rooms available in the fort) sent me to Bushire. Ahram, at the foot of the Tangestan hills is an extremely unhealthy place - very bad water, hot climate and much malaria prevalent^ food bad, the prisoners being quite dependant on tinned stores from Bushire. At first stores and letters were sent, but before I left, this had been stopped, owing to the report of ill treatment of the British, by an escaped, wounded, Tangistani from Bushire. Major O'Connor Consul of Shiraz was in very bad health, and had suffered very much on the journey from Shiraz to Ahram, without proper clothes or servants, and if he is obliged to pass the summer in Ahram his health will most certainly suffer very much. By 1 The Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Bart., K.G. , Ivi.P.,By this mall I received news from Bushire that the prisoners' stores are getting low and they are not being fed so well, exercise and baths had been cue oif. Bo parcels were allowed to be sent out and letters only very seldom. Naturally I am anxious. My husband, an Inspector ol the Indo-European Telegraph Department, was detained in Shiraz, I left him there on December 1st, 191b, and have had no word from him since. I do not know if he is still there or has been sent to the internment camp at Ahram, nor will anyone give me any news. The wife of the Superintendent of Shiraz section of the Indo-European Telegraph Department died on her arrival in England, due entirely to the shock of her sudden expulsion from Shiraz in mid-winter. I travelled home with her, and I was most anxious about her. I was so afraid she would die en route. With many apologies for troubling you, trusting you will be able to give me some hope, Yours truly, (Signed) Jess. Christmas.». .30492/16.

Hall.The spelling of the original has been adhered to. Bushire, December 19th, 1915. Dear Miss Bell:- Major O'Connor asked me to write to you and tell you exactly how I found him and the prisoners in Ahram, and to give you details of what happened in Shiraz. I don't know how much or how little you know of the affairs that .lead to the expulsion of the English from Shiraz so I will try and tell you all I can. Owing to German intrigue, our position and prestige in Persia for a long time has been extremely difficult and in danger of disappearing (I mean the prestige).- After the English left Ispahan - owing to the fact that Mr. Grahame was shot at and wounded, Major O'Connor telegraphed to the authorities for permission to take the Colony down to Bushire - he was told to hold on - then his Vice Consul was killed - his own life threatened daily - his clerk shot at but not killed - still they said 'wait”. On November 10th, the gendarmes by a well planned plot (too well planned for Persians) surrounded the Consulate, took the Major, the manager of the Bank, merchants, &amp;c., prisoners to the Gendarmerie, collected the women, and sent them out of Shiraz the sane day without proper servants with no time to pack up proper clothes even, WhatWhat they must have suffered, I can’t imagine - as travelling in Persia, especially the Shiraz to jushire road, is under any circumstances a terrible experience - but with no servants (or only one or two ignorant grooms) no warm clothes for the first part of the journey, and no thin ones for the latter part, it i rust have been as the Major said himself to me 'Hell'. ihe men, V of them, were sent to Ahram in the Sanjistani country about thirty qjiles from Bushire, and the women allowed to go to Bushire. The gendarmes who escorted them from Shiraz behaved very well and did their best. I went to Ahram before coming to Bushire and I saw Major O’Connor, who is very seedy, he has been in delicate health for some time, and the upset of it all has made him very bad, in fact, I heard the other day he was so bad they really thought he would slip through their fingers, and that he would not live to get the to Bushire. The 8 men (the Doctor has joined them since) are all living in one room. The Major has one now to himself, but such a room! The water is undrinkable, they had no cook and had to eat Persian food cooked by the Khan’s servants, very bad I believe - in fac$, Herr Wassraus the German Consul in charge, told me he couldn’t eat it himself. The climate of Ahram is bad now, of course, it is bearable, but the sunmer is terrible. I hear letters are censored which makes it diffi cult for me to tell you what I know the Major wants you to know and which was the reason he asked me to write to you. They say that some of the letters are censored here in Bushire, but all are in Bombay. TheThe opinions of the Colony in Shiraz, which natur ally are Major O’Connor’s opinions, are absolutely opposed to the opinion of the Bushire powers that be. The Bushire people only know Bushire which is not Persia, and the high handed actions of Bushire have been the cause of all our trouble up country. In the first place, the deportation of the German Consul by the British followed by the occupation of Bushire - the lowering of the Persian flag - have been used as trump cards by the Germans in stirring up the tribes in the South of Persia against us. The flag has since been raised and the Persians are laughing at us.' The German Consul Wassmus told me himself that he could have done nothing here with the tribes, had not the British played into his hands. Of course the Germans have been spending money ri$it and left in bribes, they bought the gendarmerie, paid up all arrears of pay, supplied them with new clothes, and warm bed clothes - it is more than suspected the Swedish officers are in their pay. Had we spent, as many have told me, just a mere £2000 here at the beginning of things there would have been no trouble with Germans or with the tribes. One of the head Khans of the trioes round Bushire told me himself that they had always been great friends with us - but on account of the violation oi neutrality - the landing of troops, the closing of trade routes and other actions of the British, they intended to fight to a finish. The worst of it all is that every time they fire a few shots at the sentries exaggerated reports are sent up country. To give you an instanceinstance, I was told by the Khan that the night before I got to the village they had had a fight with the British and killed 50-1 asked about it when I reached * l, ’ ! “ lines and was told that three had been wounded, two slightly and one had since died. Also the Germans are spreading lies about the big war - they told me up country that India had risen against England and thousands had been murdered - there is no one to deny these lies. I don't know if any steps are being taken to get our prisoners released - the conditions of the tribes are considered impossible. All German prisoners taken to India to be returned here, all Persians deported to India or elsewhere to be returned, all troops to be removed from Bushire, and a strong force of Gendarmes put there - that would mean all British leaving Persia of course. And really I don r t know why they shouldn’t leave - we can do nothing here or up country for ages - unless we take Baghdad and give hack Kerhela to the Persians - hut the Germans say to take Baghdad is impossible. We get no reliable news from up country - if the authorities do, they keep it for themselves. I will tell Major O’Connor I have written to you. I hope you understand how he is situated, it is for him a most impossible position - to he dragged along, a British Consul, by people wirth whom we are noc at war, jeered at en route, ill - broken down fcith overwork - trying to make the best of a oad husineo^ - his life threatened - virtually a prisoner in his own consulate for months - his Vice Consul killed, his clerk wounded - , +.V10tne rest of his colony threatened - his servants 'beaten in the Bazaars - any Persian seen going to the Consulate threatened, even the friendly Armenians afraid to go near him. And yet in spite of it all not a single Persian or German has anything hut praise of him - they all say that had he 'been allowed a free hand or had he 'been in Bushire there would have heeri^trouble in the South. I was in a position to hear a good deal, as I came down after the Colony, I was on my way home vi£L Ispahan and Teheran, and was stopped in a place called Dehbled six days march north of Shiraz, and sent down to Shiraz, finally to Bushire via Ahra. I had two nights with V/assraus the German Consul. The Tangistanis told me they are planning a hig attack on Bushire, and advised me to tell Major Trevor to clear out all the women - this, here, is looked upon as an idle threat. I do trust■I have not hored you - and I do wonder if this will reach you - if you could just send me a word I would he very grateful as I could let Major O’Connor know. Just address me 'Bushire, Persia .

Think that it would be a good thing if Persian Government sent detailed telegrams explaining situation and issuing orders for guidance to Soulet, Kawam, Shaikh of Jafar and (ihazanfar, care ol Darya Bcgi, with instructions to latter to forward them at once to addresses by quickest possible means.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001dd_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/582</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001dd</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/582</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 334/1916 Pt 1 ‘German War – Persia.
