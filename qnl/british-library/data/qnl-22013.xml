Meanwhile orders were issued b v the Government that dhalxs only purchased in the Punjab could be shipped. However, as we had already made the purchases irom Sinu before this order came into force, with great difficulty anu with your co-operation the Government of India, finally, in August 1944, allowed the export of this consigiiment as a special case. But this anall was not yet to come, as the Foreign jfixport Trace Controller at Karachi refused to allow the shipment in October, till which time the consignment was awaiting shipping space for Bahrain. By this, we have been maae to incur loss on this consignment, which has sunered the fate of alternate permissions and refusals by the hxport Control authorities in India. As^ this were not sufficient, we now understand that we have been complete -iy denied any quota for ahalls, and certain other small dealers, some of whom have not at any time made direct imports, have succeeded in obtaining licences. We shall be highly obliged if you kindly enquire why we have been subjected to this unfair and discriminatory treatment. Thanking ,&gt;ou in anticipation, Yours faithfully, p.p.

The Government of India have considered the question of improving present procedure in regard to supply df food items to the Persian Gulf generally, and have come to the concifiision that so far as bran is concerned, the existing procedure of fixing quarterly quotas should continue. The quotas, fixed by the Government of India will however be overall quotas for the whole of the Persian Gulf, the sub-division of these quotas between the various Sheikhdoms being left to the discretion of Political Resident, Persian Gulf. Names of exporters to whom allotments have been made during each quarter should be intimated to the Government of India in respect of all Sheikhdoms. A 3. Similarly the Government of India have no objection to the Political Resident allotting quotas to Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms according to their requirements inirespect of vegetable ghee, provided advance information is sent about the shippers nominated by the Political Agents in respect of each quarter. It may however be pointed otit in this connection that the Govern ment of India may not be able to permit export of a larger quantity than what was allowed to each destination in the previous year.

The Government of India want to make it clear in this connection that they hold out no guarantee that full quantities demanded will be allowed to be exported. While every endeavour will be made to meet the requirements of the Gulf to maximum extent possible, actual exports allowed will depend upon the Supply position in the country each year. In case a reduction is made in the total quotas, the quotas of individual exports will be Bduced by Government of India, Food Department proportionately without further reference to you.

The correspondence is mainly between the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain (often acting in his dual capacity as Food Controller for the Government of Bahrain), and also between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire and Government of India officials in New Delhi. The file contains estimates compiled by the Persian Gulf authorities, regarding the annual requirements for local consumption of dhal in Bahrain and the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms, and communications from the Government of India about the annual import quotas fixed for Bahrain, the Trucial Coast, Kuwait and Muscat. Also included in the file are numerous lists providing details of the distribution of quarterly quota allotments (in tons) for the importation of dhal, among approved merchants in Bahrain, Dubai, Kuwait and Muscat, together with the names and addresses of their authorised exporters and shippers in Karachi. There are also wider discussions, including the reaction of the British Indian vegetarian Hindu community in Bahrain to bans on the export of Indian pulses in 1943 and 1946, due to food shortages in India. There is some merchants’ correspondence from Bahrain importers and Karachi exporters, complaining about such matters as Government of India delays in releasing consignments of Indian pulses for shipment to the Persian Gulf and being refused export permits.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Food Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Export Trade Controller, Karachi</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bahrain, Food Controller</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Sind, Deputy Chief Controller of Prices</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Punjab</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bombay</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Karachi</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Food control</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><subject><topic>Pulses (crop)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000cd#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
