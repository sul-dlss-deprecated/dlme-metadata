Proposed Persian Gulf Order in Council. Cox, who was consulted, telegraphs as follows : 1 think that though not an easy matter it would be possible to evolve a comprehensive Order in Council which would cover Arab principalities from Koweit to Maskat inclusive. In regard to all these, rather than the bead of a diplomatic (mission ?) to one or more foreign Courts, a British repre sentative is pi actically m the position of agent of the protecting Power. On the Persian side a British representative is merely a Consular officer who is, among otheis, accredited to nominally civilised foreign government m direct relation with Great Powers and, in my opinion, dissimilarity of most of administrative conditions make it impracticable to devise one Order in Council to embrace both Persian and Arab littoral, while such an arrange ment would be, from political point of view, open to objection. For instance, proceedings in the current Abu Musa dispute demonstrate importance of maintaining unattached and distinct position of Government of India in regard to Arab principalities. Again, our rights of jurisdiction over British subjects in (group undecypherable) [sic] Bahrein, rest on the prospective (? prescriptive) rights confirmed by convention dated 31st May 1861 and un challenged by Sheikh, and also indirectly on fact that we have declared publicly Bahrein itself to be subject to form of British protection. I know of no further authority, but submit that the above will suffice.” We concur. s F—-- .... AFrom Viceroy, 28th July 1911. Foreign Secret. Situation on Trucial Coast. Please refer to letters from Naval Commander-in-Chief and Cox, dated respectively 26th and oOth April, forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s letter, No. 21 M, of 18th May. Admiral concurs as to Cox’s proposal regarding Zora, which seems to have much to commend it. With your concurrence I propose to instruct Cox to work out scheme in detail. Meanwhile, though we concur with Admiral and Cox as to desirability of tightening up our control over Trucial Chiefs, we consider it advisable to hold our hand in respect of Order in Council, pending negotiations with Turkey. We have, however, instructed Cox to prepare one, leaving the question of publication to a later date. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 1th September 1911. Foreign Secret.

It will be seen that they accept the views of His Majesty’s Consul- General at Bushire as to the particular amendments that should be provided for, namely— (!•) That Article 2 should read:—“The limits of this Order are Mohammerah with its dependencies, the coast and maritime “ provinces of Persia from Mohammerah to Gwettur, both “ inclusive, and the islands of the Persian Gulf and Gulf “ of Oman, being within the dominions of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, including the territorial waters of “ Persia adjacent to the said coast and islands ” ; (2.) That in Article 3 the expression “ Mohammerah with its depen dencies ” should be defined as “ all places within the territory geographically known as Arabistan ” ; and (3.) That in the same Article “ Maritime Provinces ” should be defined as “ the Provinces of Arabistan, Pars, Laristan, “ Karman, Persian Baluchistan, and those districts by custom “ and for the time being included under the authority of the “ Persian Governor of the Gulf Ports.” The Earl of Crewe concurs with the Government of India as to the desirability of these alterations, and would suggest that, if Secretary Sir E. Gray sees no objection, the opinion of His Majesty’s Ministers at Tehran should be ascertained, and, in the case of his concurrence, that the necessary steps should be taken to issue an amending order. It Avill be seen that copies of both Colonel Cox’s letters, Nos. 462 and 527, dated the 26th February and the 5th March 1911, are in the possession of Sir G. Barclay.

This docume?it is the property of the Secretary of State for India in Council. In continuation of previous correspondence ending with, the letter of this Office dated the 18th April last, communicating copy of the Viceroy s telegram of 13th April 1911, I am directed by the Secietaiy of State for India to enclose, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter'' 1 '' from the Government of India submitting a draft of the proposed Order in prepare the draft in the first instance. As regards what is said in the second paragraph of their letter, I am to observe that the Marquess of Crewe sees no reason to question the capacity of the Sheik to divest himself of his responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in his territory, or the effective ness for its purpose of the document that he has signed as between the Sheikh and the British Government. But the question still remains whether the jurisdiction could safely be exercised over subjects of foreign civilized powers without the assent given generally or in the particular case of the power concerned. On this point the Secretary of State will be glad to receive the opinion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs before he proceeds further. The terms of the draft Order will, doubtless, receive the careful attention of Secretary Sir E. Grey, but Lord Crewe, as at present advised, sees no reason why they should not be agreed to, and he accepts the conclusions of the Government of India on the special points referred to in paragraph 3 of their letter. He would also suggest that, if Sir E. Grey sees no objection, “ the Foreign Jurisdiction (Admiralty) Order in Council 1910,” be extended functions of a Notary Public. Sir E. Grey will be able to judge whether this power will be best conferred on the Agent by the Order in Council or by separate notification.

Sir 1911. I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to vd? [i i acknowledge the receipt of your letters of May 23rd and yph 11 June 15th, relative to the proposed amendment of the Persian Coast and Islands Order-in-Council and of trie 24th ultimo, relative to the proposed Bahrein Order in Council. As regards the former of these two questions, while Sir E. Grey -recognises that the suggestions of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire, if carried into effect, would greatly simplify the complicated system by which British jurisdiction is at present exercised in those regions, he nevertheless considers them merely as ■palliatives which will leave the situation improved indeed, but still far from simple or satisfactory. There is, in Sir E. Grey’s view, little to be gained * in the long run by such partial amendments to a system which The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(29563/11) which requires more drastic treatment if it is ever to be made to work smoothly and efficiently. The lines on which, in his opinion, this question should be dealt with are to render the political and judicial spheres of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf coincident by putting in force a Persian Gulf Order in Council, providing for the exercise of jurisdiction in all the territories bordering upon the Gulf in which administrative control is vested in the Resident and consequently superseding the existing Persian Coasts and * Islands and Muscat Orders and rendering superfluous the contemplated separate Order for Bahrein. Courts should be established wherever officials are to be found fit to exercise judicial powers and provision should be made to disestablish or vary them with comparative ease. There should be a superior court to be held by the Resident or by a person specially appointed for the purpose, to which appeals should lie from the local courts. The(29563/11) xhe la^ and macninery of the Order, within the limits of which would be included Muscat, the Trueial States, the existing Persian Coasts and Islands Order, but might well include the amendments which have been inserted in the draft Bahrein Order. Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive an expression of the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion on this suggestion. As regards the proposed Bahrein Order, I arn to state that Sir E. Grey will abstain from observations on points of detail pending a decision of the question whether a comprehensive Order on the lines suggested above is feasible second paragraph of your letter, I am to state that, in Sir E. Grey’s view, Bahrein, apart from the treaties into which it has entered with His Majesty’s Government, is a sovereign and independent state and the Sheikh is thus entitled to exercise jurisdiction over foreigners within its boundaries. He is also entitled to delegate to His Majesty’s Government by treaty, jurisdiction over such B afire in and Koweit, would be similar to that provided in With reference however to the point raised in the foreigners(29563/11) foreigners and that treaty would become operative and would transfer such jurisdiction whether acquiesced in or accepted by or notified to foreign Governments or not. dir Hi. Grey considers that the Sheikh has already, by his letter of July 16th, 1909, the terms of which are quite clear, transxerred to His Majesty’s Government jurisdiction over foreigners in his dominions and that, if the Government of any foreign Power object, the only ground on which they could base their objection would be the ground that this jurisdiction was not the Sheikh’s to grant, while if they failed to show that they themselves had received by treaty a grant of jurisdiction over their own subjects in Bahrein, they could not,it appears, claim that the jurisdiction did not belong to the Sheikh and that he had no power to grant I am to add that Sir E.

MARTIN’S LANE, LONDON, W.C. -3 No. 2938, dated Bushire, the 14th November 1909. From— Major A. P. Trevor, LA., First Assistant Resident in charge of Residency, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. I have the honour to reply to Foreign Department telegram No. S-432, dated the 5th instant, regarding the transfer of the Consulate of Moham- merah from the limits of the Persia Order in Council to those of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. I should have been inclined to suggest that the word ,f Coast ” might be defined in clause 3 (Interpretation clause) as suggested in the correspondence • Below Pro. No. e in a. Poiicai e., January isss, forwarded under Foreign Department No8 - 1 - 20 - Endorsement* No. 2683-P., dated 22nd November 1878. This course seems to have been advocated by the Law t pro. No. 4 , ibid. Officers of the Crown in their letterf dated 9th August 1878. If a definition would suffice, the definition suggested by Colonel Ross in X Pro. No. io, ibid. t* 16 enc l° su r0 to his letter^ No. 13, dated 14th January 1879, and quoted by Major Cox in paragraph 3 of his letter No. 2023, dated 15th August 1909, seems to ^ § Pro. No. 57 in External a., October 1890, Nos. me a very good one. In the 1889 order§ 55—116 ‘ &lt; # the term “ Persian Coast and Islands ’* was defined in the interpretation clause. I suppose however that some technical objection to adopting this course became apparent after the correspondence took place in 1878,I beg to suggest therefore that section 2 of the Persian Coast and Islands Order, 1907, might be amended to read as follows :— “2. The limits of this order are the Coast of Persia from Mohammerah to Gwettar both inclusive and the Islands of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman being within the dominions of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, including the territorial waters of Persia adjacent to the said Coast and Islands No. 626-G., dated Fort William, the 29th March 1910. From—The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Major Trevor’s letter No. 2938, dated the 14th November 1909, regarding the transfer of the Consulate of Mohammerah from the limits of the Persia Order in Council to those of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. 2. I am to point out that the amendment proposed by Major Trevor would not cover the case of Ahwaz, which you consider it desirable to include within the limits of the Order. To effect this object, Article 2, Part I, of “ the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907,” might be altered so as to read as follows:— “2. The limits of this Order are Mohammerah with its dependencies, the coast of Persia from Mohammerah to Gwetter, both inclusive, and the islands of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, being within the dominions of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, including the territorial waters of Persia adjacent to the said coast and islands; and the expression “ Mohammerah, with dependencies,” might be defined in Article 3 either as— “ all places within the regular districts included in Southern Arabistan,” or as &lt;( all places within the territory geographically known as Arabistan.” I am to request that you will kindly favour the Government of India with your opinion in the matter. Telegram P., No. S.-223, dated Simla, the 7th April 1910. From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—The Political Resident iu the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Please refer to my letter No. 626-G., dated the 29th March. Any available information as to places and districts now under the jurisdiction of Courts established under the respective Orders and as to the exact geographical boundary between the areas subject to them, is required by the Foreign Office. Will you therefore kindly include in your reply this information. V No. 462, dated Bushire, the 26th February 1911. From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Hon’ble Sie A. H. McMahon, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 626-G., dated 29th March 1910, regarding the transfer of the Consulate of Mohammerah from the limits of the Persia Order in Council to those of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. 2. I beg to express my concurrence in the alteration to Article 2 suggested in the second paragraph of your letter above quoted ; as regards the interpreta tion to be attached to the expression ** Mohammerah with dependencies,” I 4 ' / y o \5 would recommend the adoption of the second alternative definition in Article 3 suggested by the Government of India, namely, “all places within the territory geographically known as Arahistan.*’ 3. If this alteration be approved, the judicial powers of the Consul for Arabistan at Mohammerah will then be co-terminous with his Consular District, in which Ahwaz is included. 4. I beg leave to deal with the question of boundaries of Consular Courts generally, raised by your telegram No. 223-S. of the 7th April 1910, in a separate communication, in case its discussion should obscure the present question, which seems capable of independent settlement on its merits. 5. The point at present under reference involves some aspects of the rela tive positions occupied in regard to one another by His ^Majesty’s Representa tives at Mohammerah and Ahwaz which it was inconvenient to raise with the Government of India and His Majesty’s Legation during the tenure of an acting incumbent at Mohammerah; I therefore ventured to delay submission of my reply, but regret that the delay has been longer than I anticipated. 6. Should the proposals in regard to the relative functions and spheres of the Consulates at Mohammerah and A hwaz which I have put forward in my letter No. 461, dated 26th February, meet with the approval of the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister, it will be unnecessary to gazette the incum bent of the Ahwaz Consulate as a First Class Magistrate, as suggested in the last paragraph of my letter No. 2023 of 15th August 1909, as His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah alone will be invested with judicial functions within the Arahistan district under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. 7.

I have the honour to.refer to Foreign Department Telegram No. S-223 of the 7th April 1910 calling for information as to the places and districts now under the jurisdiction of the Persia Order in Council, 1889 and the Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council, 1907, and the exact geographical boundary between areas subject to these Orders. In my letter No.‘462 of the 26th February 1911, I asked leave to deal with this question in a separate communication, and now beg to submit my observa tions. 2. It will be convenient in the first place to consider the boundaries of Courts formally established under the Persia Order in Council, which fall within the sphere of this Residency. They are two in number and are estab lished at Mohammerah and Ahwaz respectively, while His Majesty’s Consul- General at Bushire holds a King’s Commission as Consul-General for Pars, Khuzistan* and Laristan and the district of Lingah and the Coast and Islands of the Persian Gulf, being within the dominions of Persia. No Provincial Court, however, has been established under the Order in Council, at Bushire. Similarly no provincial Court exists at Karman, which is within the sphere of this Residency, nor at Shiraz. 3. His Majesty’s Yice-Consul at Mohammerah was authorised in 1892 Minister to Resident, No. 33, dated 29th November to hold a Consular Court at Mohammerah. 1832, “ in and for his district ” under the Persia Order in Council, In 1906 His Majesty’s Yice-Consul for Arabistan was authorised to hold a t&gt; .4 A m xr oo 4 x 4 Provincial Court “ in and for Arabistan ” (1) Minister to Resident, Telegram No. 32, dated -i .n m nn 26 th February 1903 . under the Persia Order in Council. The ma? S deat t0 ForeigD ’ No ’ 474, dated 3rd Feb * two Courts thus have at present indepen dent and concurrent jurisdiotion in the province of Arahistan. Incidentally I would observe here that as the result of the developments which have taken place in Mohammerah territory during the last 2 years, this arrangement has been found to need revision, and sugges tions in that direction have been made in my letter No. '462 of 26th February 1911 above cited. 4. Three Consular Courts are established under the Persian Coasts Order in Council, 1907 ; at Bushire, Lingah, and Bandar Ahhas respectively ; whilst at Jashk and Charhar the Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs exercises jurisdiction under the superintendence of the Resident and Consul-General. I will deal with each of these Courts seriatim. 5. Bushire. —The judicial jurisdiction of the Resident and Consul-General Article 2. The limits of this Order are the Coast and Islands of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, being within the dominions of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia, including the territorial waters of Persia adjacent to the said Coast aud Islands. Paragraph 3. “Inland Persia” means the ter ritories and dominions of the Shah of Persia so far as are not included within the limits of this Order. and His judicial Assistant at Bushire, is exercisable within the limits of the Order as at present defined in paragraph 2 thereof. This definition, however, is obviously an unsatisfactory one, as the word “ Coast ” is nowhere defined, and it is apparently left to the Consul-General to determine, in any particular case under Article 62 of the Order, whether a place is or is not within his jurisdiction. 7 62. If a question arises whether any place is or is not within the Persian Coast and Islands for the purposes of this Order, it shall be referred to the Consul-General, and a certificate under his hand and seal shall be conclusive on the question and shall be taken judicial notice of by the High Court of Bom bay aud by any Court established under this Order..n i *i,nt tlie Law Officers of the Crown recommended in It may be mentioned that the ^ ^ ^ &lt;( Coast ^ aatVSh^eSnsJa 1 ” °” r ° me ' defined, but this appears to 1 have been considered unnecessary. ^y\ 6 Lino ah .—The limits of the jurisdiction of the Consular Court of this b.

The tract between the latter boundary and Jashk lele- graph Station, comprising the district of Biyaban and a small strip of the Jashk district, forms a hiatus, in which no judicial officer subordinate to the Residency exercises jurisdiction. Prom Jashk to Charbar the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs does exer cise judicial powers, hut only within the local limits of the Telegraph Stations at those ports and along the alignment of the telegraph line connecting them. 10. No Provincial Courts have been established for the Consulates at Karman and Shiraz, and consequently were the incumbents of these posts to take judicial action under either Order-in-Council their powers might be called into question. The fact is, as an examination of the definitions figuring at the commence ment of the two Orders will demonstrate, that no precise boundary between them has been laid down ; and under present conditions, while His Majesty’s Consuls at Shiraz and Karman exercise no specific judicial powers within their spheres, it would at the same time seem to be an undue strain on the interpre tation of the Coast and Islands Order in Council, as at present worded, to claim for the Consul General at Bushire jurisdiction under that Order, either in the hinterland of the maritime provinces of Pars, Laristan and Lingah (which are covered by his Commission); or in Karman and Dependencies (including Persian Baluchistan and Mekran) which have always been in his sphere as Resident but are not provided for in his Consular Commission. It may be mentioned here in passing that the convenience of the inclusion in the latter instrument, of Karman and Dependencies, as well as of Arabistan, was suggested by Colonel Ross in Appendix I of bis letter No. 13, dated Mth January 1879 to the Government of India when discussing the draft Order. II. Thus, having regard to the fact that only offences committed within the limits of the Order in Council under which a particular Court has been constituted, can be tried in that Court, and that in consequence parts of Persia beyond the limits of one Order are treated for judicial purposes as foreign terri tory by Courts established under that Order, the position is plainly one that 8 ^ .-gSSE*.9 may at any time lead to grave inconvenience. For example; at present a person deported from Karman to Bombay could return to Bushire or Bandar Abbas with impunity ; again, property in Karman could not be distrained in execution of a decree passed in the Court at Bandar Abbas, unless proceedings were commenced afresh in Karman. 9 12. A consideration of the foregoing review of our judicial position in Southern Persia under the two Orders in Council can scarcely result in any conclusion but that the state of affairs is defective and unsatisfactory and demands readjustment; but before venturing to make any proposals in the latter direction, it will be convenient if I examine the circumstances which gave rise to the Present Order in Council and the motives which actuated its authors. 18. In 1866 the Foreign Office instructed Mr. Logies, then the Judge and Consul-General at Constantinople, to prepare the draft of a Foreign Jurisdiction Order in Council for Persia, and forwarded to him a tentative draft drawn up by their Law Officers for the whole of that country. The Foreign Office having proposed that the Resident at Bushire should communicate with Mr. Logies, the then Resident, Colonel Pelly, did so by letter on the 3rd October 1866. This letter contemplated that the arrange ments for the littoral of the Gulf should be distinct from those for the interior. Correspondence on the subject continued for ten years and in 1877 Lord Salisbury in a Despatch dated 11th April stated that he entertained no doubt that Her Majesty had extra territorial jurisdiction in Persia, especially in the Gulf. He suggested that in lieu of an Order in Council applying to the whole of Persia an Order should in the first instance be issued applying to the Persian shore of the Gulf only and “ not assuming more jurisdiction than was per mitted, but going to the undoubted extent of that jurisdiction.” In order to enable the Resident and his Assistants to deal diplomatically with cases where necessary he considered it essential that the Resident at Bushire, his two Assistants and TJncovenanted Assistant should be commis sioned as Consul-General, Consuls and Vice-Consul. At that time His Majesty’s Government was represented in the Persian Gulf by the Political Resident at Bushire with his staff and by a Political Agent at Maskat. There were no Consular Officers at Karmanshah, Shiraz, Mohammerah, Ispahan, Karman or elsewhere in Central and Southern Persia, as at present. / 14i. After further correspondence it was determined that the judicial functions of the officers in the Gulf should be disconnected from their Consular powers ; and that the Foreign Jurisdiction Order should be worked by Judicial Commissioners having concurrent jurisdiction over the whole territory com prised in the Order, and nominated by the Governor-General in India, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for India in Council. It was further decided that the Resident at Bushire should at once be commissioned as Consul-General for the province of Fars and the Persian Coast and Islands, the question of Consular powers for his subordinates stand ing over pending suggestions from the Government of India. As was pointed out in a Memorandum by Mr. F. S. Reilly, apparently one of the Law Officers of the Crown, the Order differed considerably in general . character from other Foreign Jurisdiction Orders. This difference arose, he said, mainly from the nature of the official position of the Officers by whom the Order was to be worked, whose subordination was not to the Imperial Gov ernment but to the Government of India. Further correspondence on points of detail followed and it was not until 1889 that the Order in Council for the Persian Coasts and Islands was issued, simultaneously with one for Persia, The former Order underwent revision in 1907, but its special characteris tics remained substantially unaltered.10 15 Meanwhile, in the years 1903-06, political eagencies led to the estab- , 1B \ rL^iates or Vice-Consulates at Karmanshah, Ahwaz, Shiraz, tahment of Consulate Vic ^ ^ added i n 1909 a Vice-Consulate at Karman B d . dioial powers for 0 ur officers at Bandar Abbas and Ivingah. 1 q 1 ^ tj ie establishment of those posts, but the judicial necessities of the Consulates at Karman and Shiraz seem to haye been overlooked. ifi Tim further recommendation which I now venture to make in con tinuation oftlat submitted in my letter No. 462,' above quoted with the object nf consolidatin 0 ’ and regularizing our judicial position m Soutliern Persia, i S 4 hat°the limits'of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council be laid down in section 2 of the Order as, Mohammerah with its dependencies; the Coast and maritime province) of Persia from Mohammerah to Gwettar both inclusive and t ic Islands of_ the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, being withm the dominions of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, including the territorial waters of Persia adjacent to the said Coast and Islands/’ tt Maritime provinces ” might he defined in section 3 as “ the provinces of Arahistan Pars, Laristan, Karman, Persian Baluchistan and those districts by custom and for the time being included under the authority of the Persian Governor of the Gulf Ports. 17 Such an alteration would enable His Majesty’s Consul at Karman, on being duly empowered under the Order, to take cognizance of all offences com mitted within the Consular jurisdiction and to dispose of them according to Indian Law, with which he is of necessity familiar. It would correlate his jurisdiction with that of the Consul at Bandar Abbas and of the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs and greatly simplify judicial proceedings m any case which might arise entailing reference from one to the other. It would have the additional advantage of bringing into force in Persian Baluchistan, a code of law similar to that^ in force in British Baluchistan, thus making joint judicial action between our political officers on either side of the frontier easier than hitherto. It would enable His Majesty’s Consul-General for Pars to take Judicial cognizance of all offences committed within his consular jurisdiction, and would place under his judicial control those Consulates now administratively within his sphere. ^ It would further secure that officers of the Government of India would administer justice in accordance with Indian Codes, the latter being, it will be generally admitted, more suitable to conditions obtaining in Persia, and parti cularly in Southern Persia, than the somewhat complicated system indicated in the Persia Order in Council. 18. The position of the Shiraz Consulate is already anomalous, as that centre is the capital of Pars, of which the Besident at Bushire is Consul- General, and is his summer residence; experience has shown, moreover, that it would in practice be highly inconvenient and detrimental to the public service to divorce the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf from Judicial and Consular Authority in Pars. This anomaly will not, it is true, be removed should the proposals which I have detailed above commend themselves to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister, for the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council will then apply to the whole of Pars. There is no reason, however, why this should be a source of embarrassment to His Majesty’s Consul at that place. No Consular Officers exercise judicial functions in Persia under the Persian Order in Council unless the Provincial Court has been specifically established in ^ and for the district to which they are appointed. No such Court has been established at Shiraz and in common with His Majesty’s Consuls at Karmanshah andKarman, the lack of judicial powers involved by the omission seems in no way to have troubled sucoessive incumbents, since the post was created 8 years ago. ^ There would seem no objection, therefore, to His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz remaining without specific judicial powers under either Orders. Petty cases can be disposed of by him without recourse to the machinery of an Order in Council ; while more serious cases he will doubtless prefer to remit to Bushire for disposal by the Resident and Consul-General who is more conveniently placed to take up such cases (which, it may be safely assumed, would almost always concern British Indians) and can send convicted persons to India to serve their sentences in jail, or deport them, should either course appear necessary. 19. I venture to express a belief that this proposal is in harmony with the motive which induced His Majesty’s Government to establish a special Order in Council for those parts of Persia where our representatives were subordinate to and appointed by the Government of India, and that its adoption will assist us in consolidating and regularizing our judicial position in South-western Persia, which it would be better to establish now when it is not seriously contested, than to defer action until our jurisdiction is brought into question by some litigious defendant. I am forwarding a copy of this communication simultaneously to His Majesty’s Minister.With reference to your letter of May 3rci last respecting the proposed transfer of Mohammerah from the sphere of the 'Persian Order- in- Council' to that of the 'Persian Coast and Islands Order-in-Council', I am directed by Secretary Sir E.

Wa j as ty, 3 Ao ting nonsul at X ifohammerah in which he recommends that that Consulate be transferred from the sphere of the “Persian Order in Council' to that of the 'Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council'. practical Lieutenant Wilson adduces cogent/grounds for his recotisaendation, and X agree with the view expressed in the concluding sentence of his letter, vis, that all that would appear to be technically required to effect the change advocated, is an alteration of boundary to be agreed upon and recorded between His Majesty* s Minister, Tehran, and His Majesty* sMajesty^ Resident and Consul General at Bashirs; but under the peculiar circumstances of the case I think the Government C of India would wish to be consulted before I proceed any further with the matter. 3. In giving their consideration to the matter, it will be of interest to the Government of Inaia to ref^r to the correspondence of ld7d-?y which resulted 10 years later in the issue (in December ld89) of the (1) M Persia w and (2) 'Persian Coast and Islands'* Orders in council. It will be seen that Residency Letter *?o. 13 dated 14th | January 1879. Appendix 1, Paragraph 1. ) Colonel Ross ! s original suggestion ■ I II ■■ I I——■U I—I MM I'W II ■ —«— was that 'Persian Coast' should stand for 'all ports, sea coast villages and townships from Mohammerah to Gwettur inclusive, with the districts immediately subordinate to or connected therewith'. Ten years later, apparently in view of the fact that he learnt that an officer would be placed at Mohararaerah who would work directly under His Majesty’s Minister, he intimated that he understood that the limits of the Coast and Islands Order were intended to extend x Resident to Government of India. Letter | ^o. Id8 dated 22nd August 1890. | 'from the mouth of the Shatt-el* I x Arab river t© Gwettur Bay'. Thera would seem, therefore, to be no academic objection to reverting to the former interpretation. 4. Moreover, apart from the reasons given in Lieutenant Wilson* s&gt; Wilson* a coiamunication, which I endorse, there is another important argument in favour of the relegation both of Ahwaz and Mohamraerah to the primary jurisdiction of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the sphere of the coast and Islands Ord^r in Council, and that is the undoubted expediency of our neglecting no means which may offer themselves for strengthening the grounds for the claim which we have so far made good, that the Arabistan Customs are included, with those of Pars and the Persian Gulf, in the Customs of Southern Persia covered by the s pledge given to us by the Persian Government on 23 rd October 1897 . Any^o^gical measure which will uena to emphasize that position is prima facie worth taking. 8 . If the Government of India are disposed to concur in the views above expressed^ venture to recommend that steps be tajcen to bring both, the Ahwaz and Mo hammer ah. Consulates under the “Coast and Islands' Order and that the incumbent of each appoxntraent be gazetted Pirst Class Magistrate with the additional powers permissible and Subordinate Judge of the Pirst Class; as has recently been done in the case of His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas. political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have etc.I No*38 of 1909 His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate for Arabistan, Koharamerah, 24th July 1909. Prom Lieutenant A.T.Wilson, I.A. To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e. Sir, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the jurisdiction at present exercised by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan at Mohaiaaerali. 2. At present, under orders from the Secretary of State conveyed in Minister’s despatch No.33, of 29th November 1892, (Bushire endorsement No.725 of 18th December 1892) a provincial court is established at Mohammerah under the Persia Order in Council. All other Consulates in Persian territory in the Persian Gulf are, without except ion, under the 'Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council 1907' and are under the judicial as well as administrative control of His T-ajesty’s Co ns ulr General at Btshire. 3. The Kohammerah Consulate has now been transferred from the Foreign Office Consular Service to the Foreign Department of the Government of India and has been placed under the direct control of the Political Resident at Bushire*I submit therefore that it is desirable that Mo ham* merah should be under Bushire for judicial purposes also, and not, as at present, under the judicial control of His Majesty* s Minister and Consul-General at Tehran. 4. At the moment, the question is scarcely one of more than academic importance, but in view of the fact that some €) or 50 Europeans are expected to come out in the employ ment of the Anglo Persian Oil Company during the next 18 months, together ?vlth a considerable number of natives of India, it seems desirable to bring the matter to notice without delay. 5. The great objections to the continuance of the present system are (l) the delay that must inevitably attend references to Tehran, as compared with Bushire, and (2) the fact that English, and not Indian law is in force. As the great majority of British subjects in Mohammerah are natives of India, and as the Consul will be in future an Officer of the Foreign Department of the Government of 0 j . . #:ak India, thoroughly conversant with English but not with ^ &lt;&gt; ..-t g Indian law, the second objection seems to be a weighty one. 6. The principal differences between the two Orders in Council appear to be as follows Persian1 Persian Order in Cooneil 1887 {Persian Coast Order in Council (a) ' 1907 - Controls Consular jurisdiction {Controls Consular jurisdiction in all Persia, except that in-Jin Persian Coast and Islands and eluded in Persian Coast Order lOulf of Oman and adjacent in Council* tterritorial waters* (b) f British subjects and native {'British subjects' alone mention- Indian subjects are led* diffe rentiat ed• | force* (e) , i Registration fee 2s/6d and £ 5iRep:istration fee Rs*l/“ fine in default of re gist ra- |Rs*3/-.

Foreign Office, Gentlemen, 21st January 1907. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith, by direction of Secretary Sir Edward Grey, the accompanying draft of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, together with the papers relating thereto. The officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (who, as you are aware, is at the same time His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire) suggested to the Government of India in 1903 that Article 32, Part VI., of “ The Persian Coast and Islands Order, 1889,” should be amended so as to admit of Vice-Admiralty cases being tried, in the absence of the Consul-General, by that officer’s First Assistant. The Government of India and the India Office approved this suggestion, and on the 2nd September 1903 addressed a letter to this Department (Paper (B)) inviting the concurrence of the Marquess of Lansdowne to the insertion of this amendment. In a letter dated the 17th September of the same year (Paper (C)) this Department replied that Lord Lansdowne had no objection to the proposal to invest the First Assistant with the necessary powers, but that, in view of the abolition of Courts of Vice-Admiralty since the date of the Order in question, he would suggest the repeal of Article 32 and the substitution for it of another Article corresponding to those inserted in recent Orders for conferring Admiralty jurisdiction and containing the desired special provision regarding the Assistant. The India Office, on the 23rd September 1903, addressed a letter to this Department (Paper (D)) expressing their concurrence in this proposal, and in a further communication, dated the 11th May 1904 1036. a 2(Paper (E)), suggested certain additional amendments as the result of a telegraphic correspondence with the Government of India. In view of these suggestions, the moment appeared to this Depart ment to be a favourable one for a general revision of the Order in such directions as the experience of the fourteen years which had elapsed since its promulgation showed to he advisable, and for the consolidation with it of “ The Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1895,” which was itself nothing but an amendment of the earlier Order. On the 11th June 1904, Lord Lansdowne accordingly caused a letter (Paper (F)) to be addressed to Mr. Albert Gray, requesting him to draft an Order in Council giving effect to the amendments proposed by the India Office, and embodying such clauses of general application, which had been introduced into various draft Orders in Council recently prepared by him, as might be of advantage in the present case. On the 4th October 1904, Mr. Gray submitted a first draft of such'an Order, with notes in which he called attention to new and altered provisions, and raised some questions which appeared to him to require consideration by this Department and by the India Office. This draft and the notes were subsequently revised by Mr. Gray in consultation with Mr. Hurst, Assistant Legal Adviser to this Department, and the draft Order as amended in the light of their discussions (Paper (G)) was forwarded on the 25th October 1905 to the India Office, with the suggestion that it should be submitted to the Government of India for their observations. On the 21st November last the India Office addressed a letter (Paper (H)) to this Department forwarding a copy of a Despatch from the Government of India, returning the draft Order with certain further amendments, and in this form it has now been reprinted (Paper (I)). I 1° request that you will take the draft (Paper (I)) into your consideration, and that you will favour Sir E. Grey with your opinion whether its terms are fit and proper for submission to the King in Council for His Majesty’s approval. Sir E. Grey would at the same time be glad to be favoured with any observations of a general nature which you may consider it desirable to offer on the papers now submitted to you. I have, &amp;c., F. A.

Lawrence at Sea, the 2nd (received 19th) December 1905 From—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department I have the honour to refer to the draft of the revised “ Persian CW Islands Order in Council,” of which I have received an advance copy. * 4 No. W&gt;1, dated the Sth June 1903. . f.' I , n , | li3 letters to yOUt address No. 82, dated the 25 th March 1904 . indicated iq the margin, my predecessor made two recommendations: ( 1 ) That the First Assistant to the Resident should be given power tr. try Vice-Admiralty cases. ^ (2) That he should be empowered, in the absence of the Consul-General to sign and seal warrants under Articles 11 (2), 12, and 22 (3) of the old Order in Council. v ' If I understand aright, the above suggestions are both met by Article 4 (3) of the new draft, read in conjunction with the definitions of “ Consul- General,’’ “Court,” and “Judicial Assistant,” set forth in Article (3) thereof. 3. Apart from the above, there are a few points with regard to which I venture to offer some observations :— ( 1 ) The appointment of “ Judicial Assistant ” as defined in Article 3 . It would be convenient if it could be assumed that the officer performing the duties of First Assistant to the Resident, is ex-officio Judicial Assistant to the Consul-General. If this is not considered expedient, then it would be necessary that any officer gazetted “ First Assistant ” should be gazetted to the other appointment at the same time. (2) Article 21 of the new draft, dealing with contempts of Court. In this connection, I have to report that the Consular Court has occasionally been a good deal inconvenienced by Muhammadan British subjects, defendants or witnesses in cases before the Court, evading submission to the Court by taking “bast,” or sanctuary in the houses of local Persian Mullahs. If Government consider that this act is covered by and can be punished when opportunity offers under the provisions of Article 21 , it is unnecessary to draw special attention to it. If, on the other hand, it is not considered that the act of taking sanctuary is met by the Article as it stands, then I would recommend that the following clause, or words to the same effect, be inserted as clause (ii), between clauses (i) and (ii) of the Article; thus:— (ii) Wilfully evades compliance with an order of the Court, by taking “bast ” or sanctuary (with persons not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court). (hi) Article 47 (2) {a), “ Produces a passport as a British subject from British India, or a British possession.” I have not my files with me, hut it will, I think, be within the memory of the Government of India, that recent instances have occurred in which persons of Persian origin, having paid a visit to India, have returned to Bushire or elsewhere and claimed protection on the strength of British pass ports which, though they would entitle the holder to British protection in any foreign country except Persia, do not satisfy the requirements of the Persian Naturalization Act, and are not recognised by the local authorities. Under the circumstances mentioned, I would recommend that Article 47 (2) («) be amplified as follows :— («) “ produces a passport as a British subject from British India, or a British possession, couched in such terms as will satisfy the British Consular authorities at Persian Ports that the holder is entitled to British protection in Persia.” 4. Beyond the above, I have no further suggestions to make. G. I. C. P. O.—No. 3856 F. D.—27-12-1904.—55.— L. G, G.No. Wife 'E.-A. Eboh To The ASSISTANT SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA in the Foreign Department^ Major P. Z. COX, C.I.E., POLITICAL RESIDENT in th^ PERSIAN GULF, BUSHIRE. Dated Simla, the 1906. Sir, I am directed to invite attention to your letter No. T. 15, dated the 2nd December 1905, forwarding remarks on the draft of the revised “ Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council 2. I am to say that the suggestions put forward in paragraph 2 of your letter under reply are met by Articles d (3) and 29 of the new draft, read in conjunction with the definitions of “ Consul-General, ” “ Court ” and “Judicial Assistant ” given in Article (3). 3. As regards paragraph 3 (1) of your letter, I am to say that, to enable the First Assistant to the Resident to exercise the powers appertaining to the Judicial Assistant, it will be necessary to appoint him as such on each occasion that there is a change of incumbents, but once appointed he will have all the powers desired. 4. As regards the construction to be placed on clause 21 of the new draft, the Government of India are not in a position to say whether the practice of taking “ bast” in order to evade compliance with the orders of the Court can or cannot properly be regarded as covered by the clause in question. Bnt if a &gt; case arises which cannot, in the opinion of the Court, be dealt with as a contempt under the clause as it stands, it should be left to be dealt with un er the provisions of Chapter X of the Indian Penal Code, relating to contempts of the lawful authority of public servants, which has been made apphcab e o the Persian Coast and Islands as defined in the order. 5. I am to add, with reference to the modification proposed by you m Article 47 (2) (A) of the draft order, that there seems to be no objection to tne registration as British subjects of persons who hold ^British passports as sue A Persian subject naturalised in British India will, it. is true, remain a in Persia, if by the law of Persia he has not lost his original nationa i y. it does not appear necessary to make special provision for such cases in ie n ei, since the Consular Officer is not bound to afford protection to such persons even if registered, and will be able to exercise a discretion m icgar o cm. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Asstt. Secretary to the Government of Mia. '0 Foreign Office Press—Nfc 792—30-7-06 62.1906. SIMLA. FOUEIGr^ DEPART MEET. EXTERNAL.

I am directed by the Marquis of Salisbury to a^nbwlectgo the receipt of your letter of tlm 2,lotb ultimo, transmitting a copy of a Despatch from the Governor General of India, relative to the exercise of jurisdiction on the Somali Coast under the Somali Order in Council, 1889. In reply to the first inquiry of the Government of India, I am to ac quaint you, for the information of Viscount Cross, that the term “ British protected person ” covers such persons as are subjects or natives of States over which Her Majesty exercises a Protectorate, but does not include all Asiatics and Africans inhabiting the protected area now in question. With reference to the inquiry how Europeans and Americans, not being British subjects, are to be dealt with if they commit crimes, I am to state that the law is not settled on the point, and that great difference of opinion prevails upon it. As a matter of principle and theory, suc cessive Law Officers of the Crown have inclined to the view that criminal jurisdiction cannot properly be exercised over foreigners com- morant in one of Her Majesty’s Protectorates (as opposed to a part of Her Majesty’s Dominions) without the consent of the Government of the nation to which such foreigners may belong. It is, however, known that the Government of Germany, at least, favours the opposite view, and Lord Salisbury is of opinion that, in practice, it will be found expedient to consider such foreigners as amenable to British criminal jurisdiction. It is difficult otherwise to see how it will be possible ^ to secure that order and respect for law, for the maintenance of which Her Majesty’s Government have made themselves responsible in as suming these Protectorates. I am to add that Lord Salisbury concurs in the appointment of the First Assistant to the Political Agent in the Persian Gulf to be Judicial Assistant to Her Majesty’s Consul General for Pars.
