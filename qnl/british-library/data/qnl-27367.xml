His Excellency has received reports to the effect that, owing to lack of grazing in the Sulman and ■ha bio hah areas, certain section® of the Zaiyad shepherd tribe are suffering acute distress. These tribes were the chief sufferers in the Akhwan raids of past years and His Excellency therefore hopes that it will be possible to arrange for the £7,000 to be distributed at once. He understood, in conversation, that the intention was to await the payment of the balance of the compensation claimed before proceeding to the appointment of the committee referred to your letter. Hiskxcellency suggests, however, that the committee should be appointed without delay and should decide the basis on which the compensation should be distributed. The £7,000 already received could then be distributed pro rata without waiting for payment of the balance. His Excellency would be glad to know whether this suggestion could be adopted. He would also be interested to hear in due course the result of the committee’s deliberations. Yours sincerely, {Sgd.) R.S.M. Sturges. aullah Beg al Haj, K &amp;ia of the Boyal Oiwan, Baghdad.

The payment, when made, was accompanied by a letter so worded as to enable the Iraq Government to claim ^hat the whole £10,000 was due to them as a payment on account (they are making a claim for £30,0CG I damages against Ibn Saud), and that Koweit wa: not intended to participate m it.

Bushire telegram No. 76 to Colonial Office. I regret that when I resumed duties here I overlooked the fact that His Majesty’s Government were waiting on action here to get situation clea up. There has been no reply to Charge d’Affaires letter to Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of October 8th in which he made a final attempt. I spoke to Yussuf Yasin this morning following on receipt of Ibn Saud’s undertaking to accept Feisal’s award as liquidating claims question and pay balance of £30,000 to Iraq on completion of general negotiations. He confirmed the view that £10,000 paid in August was for both Koweit and Iraq and that allocation had been left to His Majesty's Government. I said I should advise you to divide money as in the manner originally proposed which had been orally notified to Hejaz Government. Yussuf Yasin did not contest the view that balance of £30,000 payable to Iraq would be balance after deduction of any sum already paid through Kis Majesty's Government# He could not expressly acquiesceacquiesce ^ actual division proposed without ashing the King. i said if he could get views of the King on this point quickly it would help but I explained° urgency of paying Koweit share. Bi my opinion His Majesty's Government are fully justified In allocating £10,000 without delay. Contention of Iraq Government that I was holding it in trust for them is preposterous. I received it on behalf of His Majesty’s Government as a result of long negotiations which turned entirely on Itm Baud's letter to Political Resident of January ^ 27th, 1930. 4 I suggest if l hear nothing further fran Yussuf Yasin within three deys that His Majesty's Government should on their own responsibility pay £3,000 to Koweit. If Iraq Government demur to receive £7,000 only we niight return that amount to Ihn Baud and let Wuri Pasha effect his own settlement in due course.

When the question of arbitration on the subject was entrusted to His Jajesty he deducted from the compensations claimed for his subjects the maximum of what your esteemed government may claim as a compensation, and, being anxious to express the feelings of amity and friendship which ai s Majesty and the * Iraq Govern ment keep to Hi® ;»ajestyj the King of Kijas and W&amp;jd and his government. HI* . .aj esty decided to mak€ the sum 30,000 Guineas only. His Majesty did not make this reduction except in the belief that the esteemed Majd Government will not raise a claim for any compensation for their subjects. Therefor® the •Iraq Government regret for their being unable to consider the statement claimed for which was forwarded with your letter In question, and they are sure that His Majesty the .ting of ijaa and Hajd will reciprocate the feeling© of amity and friendship of ids Majesty the King of •Iraq and his government and forego the claims of compensa tion of His Aaj©sty*6 subjects, which have %een deducted from the original sum of 70,000 Guineas. I am sure that your esteemed government will now hasten to pay the remaining sum of our claims which amount to 20,000 uineas. X am glad to seize this opportunity to express to Your Excellency, monsieur le &amp;inistre, my6 IjQ&amp;r Sir rancis, Office of tiie Council of ini ©ter®, •Baghdad, 16th hecember, 19 , 30 . let December, Um Council of Minister® resolved to refer to the letter of the Minister for Foreign Affair® relating to uhe ^uepoion, of cor/ipensation in reepeot of *iraq-Iajd frontier raids, for settlement of this question. The letter contained two pointe: (a) demand by iajd (oyemmentfcr payment of BO,500 Guinea® a® compensation to .Najd tribes, (b) A suggestion that part of the mm of 10,000 Guinea® deposited with ill® Britannic &gt;ajesty’s Minister at «7iddah should be given to Kuwait. In regard to the first point, the ♦Iraq Government v have ooiaiaunicated to Your excellency, in^-revious correspon dence, their view to the effect that ♦Iraqi claim®,according to list® kept at the inistry of Interior, exceed £70,000, but that His M ajtcty the King did not like to award more than 30,000 only because of hi® desire to demonstrate ‘Iracf® good will toward® tajd and in the belisf on hi® part that ifajd will not claim compensation for her subjects. $h*n at the Lupin Conference is Majesty King I bn ba’ud left to the discretion of ills Majesty King Faisal the settlement of the question of compensation, it was understood that the settlement would cover the claims of both parties, and it was on this basis (V basis of this understanding) that ids i ajesty gave Ms 320 the question of compensation to Ma was that he should determine the amount o f the Hraqi clafes crly. fnd tkst Iieqmwld te faced\ a (!]• « v:i: m ; faced with a counter ciaim f roi8 Majd, H i 8 M^eaty wouid not , have glvwn the award reducing the -Iraqi olai^ to le 83 than half* Therefore, the -Iraq Jovern-.ient oomiider that the claim now put forward by ifejd is oontrarv tn tv-« , ^ to tht underatandiag come to at the Lunin Conference, and that it is the intention of the Hajd hcvernraent to «,o bach to the position which existed prior to the meeting of that conference, namely that of each cart insisting on his ripfct to claim oompensation for all losses sustained by his subjects. If such be the intention (? of the iiaJa eo^rnment) the -Ira, Government are prepared to consider as bavin* never come about the understanding hitherto reached concerning compensation, and to agree to the question being referred to the tribunal under Article 8 of the Bahra Agreement. A8 regards the surpeation for the payment to Kuwait of £3 t 000 out of the sur.t of *210,000 deposited with Hi 3 Britannic Maj e sty * 3 l^iniater at Jld&amp;ah, the ’Iraq Go vernmont consider that this is a question for the x^ajd - 0 vornment alone to decide. ’Iraq is claiming a net compensation of £30,000, and if the iiajd Government accept this claim it is for them to decide to nay the whole or part of the amount of £10,000 to the ’Iraq Government against the latter’s claim.
