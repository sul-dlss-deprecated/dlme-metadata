As regards paragraph 7 of that note I should say that the declaration respecting Iraq could be left out of account if it is as I suppose merely a renunciation of capitulatory rights?* But you will have seen that I have asked the Foreign Office to look into this. The Treaty with the Yemen on the other hand (copy attached, please ^ return) was concluded w for India ,, and therefore falls into Beckett's Class A and will be a continuing obligation of the new Indian G-overnment. As regards your paragraph 8 I should not have thought that the Indian Government could insist on stipulation (a) suggested by Sir B.N. Rao as part of the Treaty since in internationa l law India's •new status' will be no different from what it has been since 1919, i.e. a separate inter national 'person' distinct from the U.K. notwithstanding her constitutional subordination to H.M.G. as regards (b) we have already provided in the formula I suggested in my note /Of 4th November for the transfer to the Indian Government 'of any reciprocal rights and advantages associated or connected' with the obligations and ssponsibilit ies of the internat ional instruments in questiois am sending a copy of this note to Mr. Turnbull. t ifc Hi A— —-mBmmmmmmmmmI enclose a copy of correspondence with Bagdad and Jedda about the charging of fees for visas granted to Saudi Arabians visiting Iraq.

Ho. 883. (S05/14/39). My Lord, With reference to Mr. Houstoun-Boswall’s despatch No. 5 46 of 25th July, 1938, and correspondence ending in letter No. T 15701/680/378 of 5th January, 1939, from the Treaty Department to my Chancery, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a Note Verhale from the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the continued collection of fees hy the Political Resident, Bahrain, from 8a ’ lidi subjects who apply to him for visas good for Iraq. As Your Lordship is aware, the Ministry are wrong in surmising that the contents of their Note Verhale of 20th July, 1938 was communicated to His Majesty’s Consular Officers. 2. It appears likely that the practice of the Political Agent, Bahrain is causing difficulties to the Iraqi Government in view of article 1 of the Iraqi-Sa’udi Arabian Residence and Passport Agreement of November 16th, 1936, which provides that - 'The subjects of either of the two High Contracting Parties shall enjoy in the territory of the other party treatment not less favourable than that enjoyed by nationals of most favoured nations in regard to entry and residence ... provided that neither Party shall have the right, under the present article, to claim for his nationals from the other Party more favourable treatment than that accorded by him to the nationals of such other Party.' (a translation of this agreement was forwarded to Mr. Eden in Sir Archibald Clark Xerr Y s despatch No. 614 of 31st December, 1936. * 3.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs present their compliments to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad and beg to invite a reference to their note No.11398/2217/ 100 dated 20th July, 1938, regarding exemption from visa fees for subjects of Sau’di Arabia, of which the contents are believed by the Ministry to have been communicated to His Britannic Majesty’s Consuls by the esteemed Embassy. 2. The Sa’udi Legation in Bagdad have invited the attention of the Ministry to the fact that the Political Kesident in Bahrain is still collecting visa fees from Sa’udi subjects. The Ministry will therefore be glad if the esteemed Embassy will be so good as to ascertain the fact from the said Political Resident and enquire from him as to the amount of visa fees collected by him from Sa’udi Arabian subjects from 28th July, 1938 (The date agreed upon with the Kingdom of Sa’udi Arabia for the cessation of collection of visa fees), up to the present date, in order to enable the refund by the Iraqi Government of the sums collected. The Ministry further request the esteemed Embassy to be so good as to advise the Political Resident not to collect visa fees in future from Sa’udi Arabian subjects. The Ministry avail themselves of the opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem. His Britannic Majesty's Embassy Bagdad.No. 370. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 18th July, 1939.

I shall be glad if you v/ill invite the attention of the Iraqi Government to the note verbale of the 25thJuiy 1938 from the Embassy, and will confirm to them that His Majesty’s Government are unable to entertain any departure from the general principle that fees for services rendered by His Majesty’s Consular Officers may be waived only in the exceptional cases covered by the standing regulations i.e. in cases of destitution or on grounds of professional courtesy. You may, at your discretion, explain to the Iraqi Government that, for the foregoing reasons, the sense of their note (11398/2217/100) of the 20th July,1938 was not communicated to His Majesty’s Consular and Passport Control Officers.

My Lord* In his despatch No. 283 of June 13th, last. Hie Majesty’s ombassador at Bagdad drew Your Lordship’s attention to the complaint that the Political Agent at Bahrain was continuing to collect visa fees from Saudi subjects travelling to Iraq* Your Lordship replied in despatch No. 370 (T 8083/31 )/378) of July 18th. to the effect that the fee which was for a service rendered could only be waived in exceptional cases. 2. My reason for returning to this subject is that Sheikh Yusuf Y&amp;sin asked me in a recent interview how the matter stood. I explained to him that the fee levied from Saudi travellers to Iraq was not an Iraq visa fee but a British consular fee for a service rendered. Phis reply did not satisfy oheikh Yusuf who retorted that whatever the fee might be the result of its levy was to impose on Maudijlsubjects a charge for entering Iraq. In virtue of Article 1 of the Iraqi Saudi Arabian Residence and Passport agreement of November 16th., 1936, no charge should be made to Saudis ae none is made to Iraqis entering Saudi Arabia. 3. Aa it appears from the note accompanying Sir B. Newton’s despatch referred to above that the Iraqi Govern ment are prepared to refund to the Saudi Arabian Government the fees collected by the Political Agent at Bahrain - though they were probably assuming that the fees had been collected on their account - I would submit for Your Lordship’s con sideration the following solution, rasaport officers should / continue The .ight Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.OA ,, 4ft ''i 4 / ii •* 11 ** g continue^, to affix th» appropriate consular stamps to the pa sb port of a land! applicant for &amp;?, Iraq visa but instead of collecting the cost frem the applicant should debit the Iraqi Government. An alternative would be to collect the fee from tht applicant imd to lnfoz*in him after af,:reement with the Iraq Government that the amount paid would he refunded in rag. on presentation of the passport to the proper authority. 4. bheihk msuf Yasin was further mystified by the fact that whereas the Political Agent at Bahrain charges a fee to Saudi travellers to Iraq, his colleague at Koweit doea not ch&amp;ige this fee* A telegraphic request to the political Resident in the rersi&amp;n Gulf on Govender 5th. to elucidate tliis mystery (please see my telegram Wo. 11 saving of 1959} has finally elicited the reply a copy of which I have the honour to transmit to Your hardship herewith. It appears from this letter that the Political officers at Sahr&amp;ln rind Koweit are awaiting instruct ions as to the practice which they should adopt. 5. I am forwarding a copy of this despatch to His Majesty*s mb&amp;ssador at Bagdad (Ho.509/1027/5). I have the honour to be, v/ith the highest respect.

Dear Department, We enclose a letter from Bushire Consulate-General discussing the desirability of the Political ngent, Bahrain, dealing with Iraqi passports. As you know, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the officers under his jurisdiction, like His Majesty's Representatives and Consular Officers in countries where there is no Iraqi representative, have been instructed to protect Iraqi interests (see Foreign Office letter No. /, (ffj, E 5054/502/93 of October 10th, 1932 to the India Office and Government of India despatch No. D 4350-N/32 of November despatch No. 1 (E 6768/502/93} of January 4th, 1933 to us). In view of these general instructions it seems perfectly in order for the Political Agent at Bahrain to deal with Iraqi passports, particularly since he already issues visas for Iraq. May we suggest therefore that copies of Foreign Office circular despatch No. T 13733/257/378 of December subsequent circulars regarding Iraqi Nationality and passports should be sent to the Political Resident, for distribution to Bahrain and to any other posts in the Persian Gulf who have not received them, so that they may take action in accordance with them? 16th, 1932 to the Political Resident, enclosed in your 'f-* 30th, 1933 to His Majesty's Consular Officers and of /We Treaty Department, FOREIGN OFFICE.We are sending a copy of this letter to Bushire.

If both these facilities for Iraqi subjects working in Bahrain were available, advantage would accrue. 2. Political Agent, Bahrain, is not of course a fully powered Consular Officer, but he does issue visas for Iraq. Tentatively we are inclined to think that as we look after Iraqi interests in Bahrain, steps might be taken to establish (a). As for (b) we are not sure how this would work in practice, and from whom the passports would come in Iraq. It is possible complications might arise. 3.

H-5 (a FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 26th March, 1938. My dear GilDson, ^ With reference to your letter P.Z .1546/38 of the 14th March on the subject of the protection of Iraqi interests in Muscat we have the following observations to offer. # \ ’ Oq V tl 'J) °l. &lt; 1 &lt;* Y' v 04 | r— % 2. Before the 3rd October 1932 the protection of Iraqi interests abroad naturally devolved upon His Majesty*s Government as the Mandatory power and Iraqi nationals abroad enjoyed the status of British protected Persons. With the admission of Iraq to membership to the League they no longer enjoyed this status, but at the specific request of the Iraqi Government His Majesty’s Government continued to have charge of Iraqi interests in places where the Iraqi Government did not have their own diplomatic or Consular representatives. 3. Government of India letter No. D.4350-N/32 of the 21st November 1932 does not appear to have been /addressed J. P. Gibson, Esqaddressed to the political Resident in the Gulf, and it is not apparent that any formal notification was addressed at the time hy the political Resident to the Sultan to inform him that His Majesty*s Government was continuing in charge of Iraqi interests in His Highness's State. If in fact no such formal notification was made there would appear to he some advantage in regularising the position in this respect. If necessary the reason for the somewhat delated action could he explained informally to the Sultan. 4. With reference to paragraph 3 of Fowle's letter of the 23rd February to Metcalfe it could also he explained to His Highness that it would he unusual for him to require or expect the Iraqi Government to make a notification direct to the Muscat Government on the subject, as in accordance with the normal practice followed in these matters a notification of this nature is left to the Government which has assumed charge of the other Government's interests. 5. It is perhaps necessary to observe that the assumption, by request, of the charge of Iraqi interestsin Muscat does not per se confer any rights of jurisdiction hy the Political Agent (qua His Majesty’s Consul) over Iraqis in Muscat. It only confers British Consular protection on such nationals. 6. With regard to the particular case which gave rise to Powle’s letter to Metcalfe it may he mentioned that the taking of evidence on commission is sometimes done judicially (e.g. hy a Consular Court) and sometimes hy Consular Officers exercising no judicial powers. In the latter case His Majesty’s Consul could only invite the witness voluntarily to give his evidence and could not of course, for reasons stated above, compel him to do so, and where Iraqi courts request British officers in Muscat to obtain the evidence of Iraqi witnesses the request should he regarded as a request addressed to the political Agent in his Consular and not in his judicial capacity. 7. It seems to us possible that if the position regarding the charge of Iraqi interests in Muscat is regularised as suggested above and if the position is /explainedexplained to the Sultan, His Highness may he disposed to he complaisant if further cases of the kind referred to occur.

(Sent 7.0 p.m., 31st August, 1932,) Circular B No.102. My circular despatch No.418 of August 6 th 1930. In pursuance of resolution adopted by Council of League of Nations on May 19th last (67th Session, 4th Meeting, item 308.1), ills Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom approached foreign Powers concerned with request that they should renounce maintenance Iraq after termination of mandatory regime of capitulatory rights possessed in former Ottoman Empire. Majority of Powers have already replied and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom expect shortly to be in a position to notify to the League that all Powers concerned have agreed to renounce. It is proposed when making this notification to add that the Mandatory naturally consents to a similar renunciation. We assume that this course will be in accordance with the wishes of His Majesty's Governments in the .Dominions. Capitulatory rights have, as you are aware, never in fa % been exercised in Iraq during the mandatory rlgime, and were formally suspended by Council decision of September 2 ?th 19.34 iMr.Amery’s despatch Dominions Ho.46 of 9 th February 1925) Termination of mandatory regime which it is hoped win become effective by admission of Iraq to membership of the League in September next would in theory result in automatic revival of theae rights winch would of course be impracticable. it would also be COPY SENT BY AIR MAH# —— ENCLOSURE IN WEFKiV 1 rTTER | No. E37_ 15 SEP. 1932 ' !

Walton I attended a meeting held at the Foreign Office yesterday afternoon to discuss capitulations in Iraq. The League of Nations, with more ingenuity than commonsense, has decided that for the duration of the Mandate the Ottoman capitulations are not really dead hut only sleeping, and that on the expiry of the Mandate they will spring to life again, unless all the nations agree to renounce their capitulatory rights. Power has therefore been obtaining agreements from the interested nations and all except Italy and Hungary have now consented to renounce their rights (some of them making their agreement conditional on renunciation by all the other powers concerned); it is hoped that Italy and Hungary will soon notify their agreement. It will then be necessary for the Mandatory Power itself to notify the League that it renounces its capitulatory rights, and since these rights were held by all British subjects the question was whether the Dominions would have to be asked for their formal consent.

I am to suggest, for the consideration of Mr. Secretary Churchill, that Sir P. Cox should be informed in reply that it is not proposed in existing circumstances to require registration in Mesopotamia under the Ottoman Order in Council, as, when the Turkish Treaty of Peace and the Mandate come into force, British extra-territorial rights in that country will cease, and the Ottoman Order in Council will no longer operate there. 3. Similarly Sir Percy Cox will not then exercise the functions of a Consul-Oeneral, and no action in the matter of such registration need therefore be taken by him during the period before the new system is legally in operation.
