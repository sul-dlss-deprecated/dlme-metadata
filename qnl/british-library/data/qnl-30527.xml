The Sultan, if this report is true, seems to have imagined he had reverted to days when Muscat controlled a fleet of 74 gun ships. With reference to this trip I had a mild protest from the Senior Naval Officer, saying that the size of the guard and retinue taken was inconvenient and suggested an operation of some magnitude. It does not appear that the Sultan even took the Command ing Officer of 'Fowey” into his confidence, or revealed his plans: end I feel that Byard in your absence might have advised him better. Unless you see strong objection, I think you should have a word with the Sultan deprecating any tendency to overstrain the assistance and co-operation he has so often received from His Majesty 1 s Navy.^ I am sending a copy of this letter to Poland. t _ : 4'—» Major R.P.
