No. 45675, I am directed to enclose copy of a Secret letter from the Govt, of to the future of the Seistan Branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia. on the failure of the Branch, owing to the restricted scope of its operations, to meet satis factorily the needs of the Indian trading community in Seistan. They propose, unless the Imperial cure Bank is willing to extend the operations of the Ba&amp;k so as to include a trade Agency business, subsidy of a similar amount should be granted to the Punjab on the terms stated in Sir H. McMahon's letter of 10 Feb. 1909, of the ImperialBank in Seistan and establish a Trade Agency on the lines considered desirable India, dated 15th April last, as (y) The Govt, of India lay stress J^Tarxc bt that the subsidy of &lt;£1500 a year wh ich expired in Sept. 1908 should not be renewed, and that a Banking Company who are willing to take over the existing business by the Govt, of India. The&lt;£) ( 3 ^ Th &amp; cnt ici stus of th&amp; Govt • of Indio, make it clear^ in Lord Morley's o^iraon, that a renewal of the subsidy to the Bank on the present terms would not be Justified } even though the figures furnished with your letter of the 7th Jan. show an improvement in the working of the &amp;mk during the past year. (h) -As regards the proposal* to renew the subsidy on condition that the Bank agrees to extend /kue ct fcfn-i s the scope/ of the Branch in the manner suggested by the Govt, of India, it seems open to Question i whether the Bank even if willing and able under the terms of their Charter, could carry out success- f^lly in Seistan an Agency business of the kind in question which would be altogether outside the lines on which t-^zis accustomed to work. The correspondence forwarded by the Govt, of India between the Manager of the Bank H.M. Consul tends to show that the Bank's servants might fma it difficult to accommodate themselves to the requirements considered necessary for Indian traders in Seistan. As—regards ike ✓ f(j&gt;‘) — suggestion of the Govt, of India that the Punjab Bank might, if necessary, be subsidised to Branch, establish a bwk in Seistan, two questions rise, on which Lord Morley would be glad to be favoured with Sir E.Grey 's opinion. The first is whether the course proposed could be adopted without contravening the rights of the Imperial Bank who may regard their Ihurter as conferring something of the nature of a monopoly. The second is whether an Indian bank could establish a branch in Seistan without the consent of the Persian Govt. (/}) If the question were absolutely open, the preferable course, in Lord Morley 9 s opinion, would be to close the Imperial Bank's Branch and to establish in its place a branch of the Punjab Bank, which could apparently be trusted to meet the needs of the Indian traders. But, in view of the relations of the Imperial Bank with H.M.Govt. and of the circum stances in which the Seistan Brunch was established, Lord Morley would propose that the Bank should be informed0 informed that it is considered a necessary condition of any subsidy to a Bemk in Seistan that its operations should include the business of a Trade Agency; and that t hey should be asked whether they would be prepared to arrange acordingly. }Jo pressure to induce them to agree seems desirable, but it will presumably be necessary to let them know of the suggestion of the (Jovt. of India unless it is ance should be given to an Indian Bank to open a branch there on the lines desired, (l) An alternative course, which in Lord Morley *s opinion has much to commend it, is to take this opportunity to inform the Imperial Bank finally that the subsidy will not be renewed, and to consider the measures to be taken to establish a Trade Agency, as distinct from a Bank, in Seistan, in connection with the proposals for the establishment of sample rooms in the more important commercial centres in the^ ^ No. 61 op 1909. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To The Right Hon’ble VISCOUNT MORLEY of BLACKBURN, O.M^ ^ Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 15th April 1909. My Lord, ^ ^ In continuation of our telegram, dated the 12th March 1909, we have the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty’s Government, a copy of the papers cited in the attached list, on the subject of the Seistan Branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia. 2. The circumstances in which, in 1903, the Imperial Bank of Persia agreed to open a branch at Seistan in consideration of a subsidy of £1,500 a year as a provisional measure for five years are known to His Majesty’s Government. The objects which we then had in view were the strengthening of our political position in Eastern Persia and the encouragement of Indian trade. On the termination of the agreement in 1908, the Imperial Bank inti mated that they were unwilling to continue the branch, which had been working at a loss, unless an increased subsidy were guaranteed. After a careful consider ation of the question, we were forced to the conclusion that, in view of the existence of a Russian Bank in Seistan, the withdrawal of the branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia would endanger the maintenance of our prestige in the British sphere, for we are not prepared to admit that the Bank has failed entirely as an instrument for fostering political influence. We did not over look the fact that, as a means to the furtherance of Indian trade, the Seistan branch had disappointed our expectations, but, as there seemed some probability that the Bank authorities would consent to widen the scope of their operations, we deemed it preferable to defer consideration of the possibility of replacing the Bank by another more suitable institution. We accordingly, in the Viceroy’s telegram of the 22nd April 1908, expressed the view that it was desirable, rather than allow the branch to be withdrawn, to increase the subsidy by £600 a year. 3. Recent events however indicate that the Imperial Bank is either unable or unwilling to embark in commission or trade agency business, and we concur witn the views expressed by Sir Henry McMahon and Major Kennion that our interests will be better served by establishing in Seistan, if possible, the ranch of a Bank with a more elastic constitution than that of the Imperial ank. We, therefore, authorised Sir Henry McMahon to approach the Punjab an ing Company with the object of ascertaining whether they would be prepared to consider the question of establishing a branch in Seistan. It will * Enclosure No. 5 . observed from Sir Henry McMahon’s ,1 . letter* of the 10th February which reports e result or his interview with the Directors, that the Company are prepared o consi er a proposal to replace the Imperial Bank of Persia in Seistan and o un eitake a combined banking and trading agency business.4. The terms which they suggest do not appear to us unreasonable, and we would therefore propose, with Your Lordship’s approval, in the event of the ^ *' Imperial Bank of Persia being unwilling to extend its operations on similar ‘ lines, that negotiations should be opened with the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Punjab Banking Company with a view to transferring the business to the ./ latter. ~ * ft s We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, &lt; I lList of enclosures in Secret despatch No. 61 (External), dated the 15th April 1909, from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, to His Majest/s Secretary of State s for India.

A., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to request a reference to my report on the trade of Seistan and Kain for 1907-1908, which was forwarded with my letter No. K. 113, dated 12th of August, and to submit some further observations which I did not consider proper to include in a paper intended for publication. 2. It will be seen from a reference to section V of the report that owing to the advantage possessed by Russia in the matter of communications, our trade with the Kainat is fighting an uphill battle. How disadvantageous our position in this respect is, can be judged from the fact that Indian tea imported by Batoum and Meshed and sold under another name can compete in the Birjnnd bazar with Indian tea imported by Nushki. When this is possible, it is obvious that trade goods produced in Russia must, ceteris paribus, have an enormous advantage over those produced in the United Kingdom and India. The fact of our possessing so large a share of this trade as we do, is chiefly owing to the superiority of certain of our wares (such as piece goods) or to our having the monopoly of supply (as in the case of indigo), but these conditions are not of a permanent character, and if our trade is to succeed, it must be by means of better organisation, which implies the judicious expenditure of money, and neglect of no means however small of attaining the end in view. I refer primarily to trade with the Kainat, for not only is it of more impor tance in itself than the Seistan trade, but owing to the latter Provinces geographical position, measures taken with the object of improving our trade with the Kainat would assist equally that with Seistan. In the following paragraphs, I propose to touch on the points where our present organisation is susceptible of some improvement. (1) The further experience I have had in this Consular charge, since last year I recommended the establishment of a Vice-Consulate in Birjand, has convinced me that the course I then recommended is essential to the vigorous extension of our commercial and political interests in these parts. I trust that a decision on this important question may soon be arrived at. (2) In my letter No. 27 C., dated 31st January 1908, I stated that the Manager of the Nasratabad branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia (Mr. J. McMarray) had undertaken to purchase and import goods from India and England on a deposit being made to cover part of the cost. The idea was, that the Branch Manager in Seistan, where there is but limited scope for the more ordinary functions of a Bank, should undertake Agency of a somewhat similar kind to that transacted by the Russian Banks in Persia, whose methods have been frequently described in the trade reports of Khorasan and Seistan. It was, however, only proposed that the Imperial Bank should import goods actually indented for by respectable traders, after sufficient part of the cost had been prepaid to insure the Bank against loss. It was similarly understood that the Manager would transact Ageucy work for English buyers of Persian goods. An un-official correspondence I have had with Mr. McMurray on the subject of an application which Mr. Howson recently received from a Birjand trader for the supply of goods in the way described, show that he has to some extent receded from the position he had previously taken up. As the question of agency is of no little importance to the future of the Birjand trade, I forward a copy of the correspondence referred to, which will make clear the nature of the objections which Mr. McMurray now finds against carrying out what I hold to be his original undertaking. As will be seen, the correspondence assumed a somewhat controversial tone, and there has been some misunderstanding about the exact arrangement made, but as it is immaterial to the real point at issue, whether the responsi-2 Cs. bility for this rests with me or Mr. McMurray, I refrain from saying more on this the Branoh Mana ge r is now prepared to do, as shown by the correspondence, is— . - , » • t Sftf.SStttfSii - ”‘* u « t'””' purchase and 25 per cent, of the estimated cost of carriage. (2) To pass on orders from Indian and English buyers of local (Pcrsi ) products.^ ^ regponsibiUty is declined as regards the execution of the ° rde it is of course something that the Bank will undertake the work at all, hut since the chief difficulty of Persian traders in dealing with foreign countries is in obtaining reliable Agents, it would have been very much more Satisfactory if the Branch Manager had seen his way to accepting indents and hfmself wranring to get them executed instead of merely passing them on. Tim nb fct ions' ur-ed by Mr. McMurray to this course appear chiefly to turn on its^otheln &lt; ’ U “ banking ” and the fact that he lacks the expert knowledge ?hat would be necessary to select goods. The former does no seem to me to •l slinnld rarrv in Seistan, while the lattei difficulty couhl'easily be removed by the Manager employing people who possessed the requiredjualon ^ o1 ,j ection9) it will he seen from Mr. McMurray’s final letter of the 27th July 1908, that he disagrees with me as to the importance nf the Aaency question and indeed holds that no assistance or organisation of kind suggested is advisable, apparently thinking that Persian buyers and English manufacturers should correspond with one another direct, or that Pers an traders shonld send their Agents to India The impossibility of business being carried on by means of correspondence between firms n (say) Biriaud and Manchester is obvious, if for no other reasons than the time letters take in the post and the fact that Birjand traders who generally have bu small businesses 1 , require consignments of mixed goods The expense o sending special agents to India puts this plan out of the power of most Biriand Traders. The very fact of one trader having recourse to such a means itself indicates the need for an Agency, for it is superfluous to point out the waste of labour and money that would be involved in eaca trader sending an Agent to India. The suggestion becomes still more absurd if applied to traders wishing to import goods from England, ihe policy of laisser faire, which Mr. McMurray advocates in this matter would in short lead to the complete ascendency of Russian trade in these parts. Mr. McMurray himself till recently held a different opinion about the Talue of Agency to wbat he does now. In a letter to me dated 3id May 1907, he wrote :— . , , “ Russian trade on the other hand is pushed m a most energetic and methodical manner, on the slow but sure, small protit and quick return nrinciple. They have Agents in almost every village who are supplied with goods P from the Husseinabad Emporium ($.&lt;?., the Russian Bank) to the value of Tomans 1,000 or 5,000 according to the size and importance of the village, all that is asked of them being a deposit of 20 per cent, or failing that two guarantors known to the Russian Bank. It stands to reason therefore that with these Agents scattered all over the Province and such facilities granted them Russian trade must be vastly superior to British Indian so long as tho latter continues to be in the hands of the people I have mentioned. Mv opinion is that if our trade in these Provinces is to be pushed, the best I means'of doing so is by the establishment of an importing and exporting A^enov, i.e., cue that will undertake to buy from samples. The Imperial Bank having offices here and in England, is of all means ready to hand, m the best position to transact such a business; and in view of the special circumstances of the Branch in Seistan, I think it not unreasonable to expect them to do so.I should, however, have been content to wait and see the result of the arransrement now arrived at, though far from complete or satisfactory, before submitting the question, if Mr. McMurray had not intimated that he might soon he transferred and raised a doubt whether his successor would he able to undertake even as much as he has done. In view of this contingency, I think it would be preferable that the question should be referred to the Head Office of the Bank, if this has not already been done, so that definite instructions on the subject may be issued to Mr. McMurray or his successor. In the case of the Bank agreeing to enlarge its business in the way proposed, I would suggest that the Tehran office be asked to send to Seistan, when Mr. McMurray leaves, a Manager with special qualifications for the work. In conclusion on the subject, I would respectfully submit that if the Bank declines to allow the Seistan Branch to engage in other than purely banking business our trading interests would be better served by the first of the alternatives mentioned in my letter cited (the establishment of a trading Agency), than by paying to maintain the local Branch of the Imperial Bank. (3) In my despatch No. 17, dated 30th March 1908, to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, I made some other recommendations which I considered would enhance the usefulness of the Branch of the Imperial Bank in Seistan, viz :— (а) The establishment of a regular Agency at Birjand. (б) An increase in the capital allotted to the Branch. Both these steps are very necessary in the interests of our trade. (4) By whatever Agency goods are got up, their carriage between the rail head and Persia must in most cases be by the means of Government’s transport organisation. Por Indian traders and those who have Agents at Nushki, the present arrangements are no doubt satisfactory, but others experience great difficulties and delays in getting their goods despatched from Nushki. The Manager of the Seistan Branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia in a letter dated 2nd July 1908, writes as follows :— “ The merchants (in Kain) seem disposed to improve their commercial relations with England and India if only better arrangements were made at Nushki for forwarding their goods. ** Euture prospects depend almost entirely on this ; the route itself would become quite popular, and trade receive a great impetus if something could only be done to avoid the awful delay which occurs under the present arrangements. “ The few experiments made by Persian merchants unfortunately met with little success, as the delay in transit caused them great inconvenience and loss. “ If the Punjab Bank could only be prevailed upon to appoint an Agent at Nushki who would take delivery of goods at the Railway Station, pay camel hire and insist on the contractors producing camels in a given time, the present delay and inconvenience would disappear. The goods could be sent to our care, and any expenses incurred by the Agent at Nushki collected before delivering them to the Consignees. Merchants would then be happy in the knowledge that they had agents of repute to safeguard their interests against the camel contractors, and, most important of all, they would, at the time of orerding their goods, be in a position to say approximately ^ the date on which their goods would arrive at their destination. This is one of the first essentials to successful trade, and once it has been achieved one will be able to say that trade has at last been established. Otherwise, as things are at present, trade will always he of a spasmodic character and will depend largely on the experiments of merchants who have not already^ given this route a trial, and know nothing of the difficulties and delays which are bound to occur under the present conditions.” In writing in the strain Mr. McMurray does not overstate the case. The way in which the organisation of the route could best be improved in this4 by »«t» d °,s April' Im April 190?, and is identical with that from His Majesty’s Con ui. recommended by Mr. McMurray. It is to be hoped that this or some similar arrangement will be found possible. (5) Tlie loss of time in getting goods from India is in part due to unavoidable delays connected with goods traffic on Indian railways. If a somewhat similar concession to that already granted in the case of goods rates was sanctioned for merchandise sent by passenger train also, it would be of considerable assistance to the trade. This will be understood when it is remembered that owing to the great cost of camel transport, the trade is practically confined to goods of a valuable kind and in such cases speed in delivery is often of more importance than a small saving in cost. At present, the difference between one-tbird goods rates and full passenger rates prohibits the use of the speedier service ; but it seems likely that a certainty of getting goods from India quickly would constitute a strong inducement to tradcis who would otherwise get their requirements from Meshed. My recommenda tion on the subject is that the further concession suggested be tried as an experiment. (6) In consequence of the great geographical difficulties our trade has to contend with, a good parcels post service assumes an importance it would not have under more favourable conditions as regards means and speed of transport. The inadequacy of the present service has been brought to the notice of the Government of India in my letter No. 149 C., dated 6th May 1908, to whieh I would respectfully invite attention. (7) At present Nasratabad, which is a first class Customs bureau, is the only place in the two Provinces where parcels arriving by post from India can he cleared from the Customs house. This rule practically prohibits traders of Birjand from obtaining goods from or through India by this means. It might perhaps be thought that the parcels post business with Birjand is not of sufficient importance to warrant any special arrangements for Customs being made, hut this is most probably due to the very disability I would desire removed. The question is of more importance to our trade than at first sight seems, and I trust it may be found possible to induce the Persian Government to take steps to put Birjand on a more favourable footing in respect of the parcels post service. 3. To summarize : the recommendations I have made for the improvement of our trade are :— (1) The establishment of a Vice Consulate at Birjand. (2) That the Imperial Bank be asked to authorize the Seistan Branch to undertake Agency between British and Persian traders on the lines indicated, or failing this the establishment of a separate Agency for the purpose. (3) That the Imperial Bank he moved to have a regular Bank Agency at Birjand, and to increase the capital allowed to the Branch. (4) The improvement of the trade route organisation by the establish ment of an Agent of the Punjab Bank at Nushki. (5) A rebate on Bailway charges for Persian trade goods sent by passenger train, similar to that already granted in the case of goods traffic. (6) The improvement of the parcels post service between India and Persia. (7) That the Persian Government should be moved to allow foreign parcels to be cleared from the Customs house at Birjand as well as at Nasratabad. 4. Some other matters affecting trade which have not been touched on in annual report are the following :— (1) The question of communications on the Persian side have been brought before the Persian Government by His Majesty’s Legation with5 the result that orders Lave been issued for the improvement of the Palan* Kuh route. This wil remove a serious obstacle in the way of trade between India and Birjand. The need of a road between Koh-i-Malik Siah and f a ® rat ^ b ^ d 1S fli a s( ?, badl 7 felt , but this is a more difficult and expensive piece of work than the other, and as its construction is less necessary in the interests ’ 1 ^ 1 ^ k ’ be time t0 move . the Persian Government in the matter alter the Palang Kuh route lias been finished, (2) I have receivod no serious complaints against the Customs Depart- “ unn S. *6 year and such trifling complaints as I have had occasion to D ° ,, 1 their notlce have always been promptly dealt with, delations generally between His Majesty’s Consuhite and the Belgian Customs officers nave been very cordial. (3) The question of a reduction of the Persian export duty on cereals was examined in detail in my despatch No. 16, dated 28th March 1908, to His Majesty s Legation, m which the conclusion was arrived at that both in the interests of the Persian Government, Seistan agriculture, and our own trade the duty on both wheat and flour should be reduced to a nominal figure. At the present time the exportation of grain is allowed ; and with the recent reduction in hire charges for returning camels, Seistan grain will pro bably be used on the western end of the trade route to an increased extent It is thus desirable that exportation should not be again prohibited bv the Persian Government. j * (4) dn the Nushki trade report for the year 1907-08, the following remark is published ^ wiu 0 “ Had the Persian authorities permitted the exportation of ghi which is one of Seistan’s staple products, the money so obtained would have gone tar to put this right and would not only have benefited the Persian revenues directly, owing to the enhanced receipts which would have resulted from the additional Customs collections, but would have furthermore given an impetus to the breeding of more flocks and would have thus benefited the revenues indirectly as well. In nearly every Consular report dealing with Persia, reference is made to the great disadvantage which Persian trade has to contend with in its want of exports. In the case of the Quetta-Nushki route this did not apply with so much force as in ghi was found an article which to lar°&gt;e extent covered this falling. The decision to prohibit the export of ghi which was promulgated in 1903 dealt a severe blow to our trade and although this prohibition has been rescinded to the extent of allowing 50 Tabriz Kharwars or^ 400 Indian maunds the value of which amounts say to Rs. 12,800 to leave Seistan annually, this concession is practically valueless as it is obvious to any one who directs a thought to the matter that the Seistani will not spend weeks and possibly months collecting this article to find later on that he is debarred exporting it as the sanctioned amount has already passed out of the country. In the exportation of ghi is to a great extent bound up the consistent develop ment of our trade with Seistan, and I would commend this matter for very earnest consideration.” I he facts are that during the summer of 1907 His Majesty’s Charge d’Affairs at Tehran with some difficulty induced the Persian Government to allow as a tentative measure the exportation of 40 Kharwars of ghi. In addition to this the exportation of a further quantity of 50 Kharwars was sanctioned for the Robat garrison. Under the two concessions together (between which the Customs Depart ment have made no distinction), up to the end of the year, only Kharwars 30 were actually exported, out of a total sanctioned quantity of Kharwars 90. It is clear therefore that, except for the needs of the Robat escort, practically no advantage was taken of the permission secured by His Majesty's Legation. I may add that the Indian traders of Seistan, on whose request the question was originally raised in the spring of 1907, have since made no application or other sign from which it might be judged that they wished the concession extended ; w hile the leading Hindu trader of the place himself told me thatthe exportation of ghi did not at present pay ; a conclusion which is confirmed hya simple calculation :— Krans. Approximate average cost during 1907-1903 of 1 camel load (400 lbs.) ghi in the district ..... 437-5 Carriage to Seistan ....... 6 Packing ......... 40 Carriage to Koh-i-Malik Siah ...... 16 Agency at Koh-i-Malik 3iah ...... 1 Export duty .... .... 43-7 5442 Krans 544 - 2 = R 158-8 Carriage Koh-i-Malik Siah to Nushki .... . R19-5 Cost landed at Nushki ...... . R178-3 The above is under the most favourable conditions, that is, when advan- tage had been taken of returning camels. The ordinary cost of exporting ghi to Nushki would have been — Krans. Cost in district ........ 437-5 Carriage to Seistan ....... 6 Packing ......... 40 Carriage to N ushki ....... 100 Export duty ........ 43-7 Passport fees one-third ....... 6-6 GSS’S = R184-9 There are in addition miscellaneous charges to be allowed for. Now a trader knows that in sending ghi to Quetta he will lo-e a not inconsiderable percentage by dryage, he will undergo risks of his leather bottles or tins breaking and the various other mishaps that may overtake a perishable article on a long trade route, and, finally, after taking all these into account, he will not consider the speculation worth making unless he sees a reasonable chance of substantial profits at the other end. i have no information about the wholesale rate of ghi in Nushki, but the retail rate during the year was R1 per seer. Taking the shopkeepers profits at 10 per cent., he would buy ghi at annas 14'4 per seer or R180 per camel load of 400 lbs. It is clear therefore that under the market conditions that prevailed last year, Major Webb Ware’s Seistani, who spends “ weeks and possibly months in collecting this article ” would have been ill advised to send it to India, especially in view of the fact that he has good markets nearer him in Birjand and Khorasan. During the current year also, owing to a bad grazing season, ghi is dear in both Seistan and Kain and will remain so at any rate till next season^ prospects are assured. The time would therefore be inopportune to press on the Persian Government a further concession of the kind Major Webb Ware recommends. I I have only referred to the matter at this length as this is the second time the Political Agent has expressed the same views as to the duties of those responsible for British interests in Seistan in this matter (the first was in his dairy for week ending 24th Pebruary 1908), and from the passage in the published trade report which has been quoted, the inference might be drawn, either that His Majesty’s Consul had not taken the trouble to “ direct a thought to the matter ” or if he had done so, had omitted to put his thoughts into any sort of action.% • ^ As has Wn pointed out in the trade report, one of the chie* faefnr.

I have to thank you for your letter of the 24th February forwarding samples of certain products of the Province of Kain.^ Before bringing the same to the notice of firms in this country likely to be interested in the matter I should be glad if you would kindly ascertain whether there are any European firms in the district who could be entrusted with the execution of orders. If not, it would appear that the business suggested could only be done by a traveller buying, selecting, and taking away bis goods, and that such business in practice could only be undertaken by a native, as the expenses of a European would be too heavy. 1 should, however, be glad to learn your views on this point.

I am sorrv you did so, as tliis proposal is more tlian I oan possibly undertake for many reasons. In the first place it would be impossible forme to purchase goods in the Kainat for merchants at home or in India, not being on the spot, and secondly, even if I was resident in Kain and had a staff sufficient to cope with it, my knowledge of the different commodities is so limited that I could not undertake the responsibility of buving and forwarding them. Furthermore my contract with the Bank does not permit of my doing any business on my own outside banking, and lam perfectly certain they would not accept responsibility for my actions if I undertook such a business as you suggest. I am prepared to assist trade in any way that a Banker may, and have indeed offered to send on orders made up by firms or merchants in England or India and arrange for the payment of the goods on their depositing 25 per cent, of the approximate value landed in Birjand, charging interest, etc., as mentioned in my log of a week or so ago. The making up of the indent must rest entirely with the merchants, and the Bank cannot be responsible in any way for goods not being according to sample, loss or damage in transit. I might be able to effect insurance on goods from England but not from India. What in my opinion would be more to the point would be for merchants to put themselves in direct communication with firms at home and in India, do their own buving direct, and so save the middleman’s profit. **t#**»* Dated Camp Salmabad, 6th July 1908. From—His Britannic Majesty^s Consul, Seistan and Kain, To—The Manager, Imperial Bank of Persia, Seistan. Many thanks for your letter of the 2nd July. About your remark re the purchasing of goods in Kain for English and Indian firms, you will remember I spoke to you on the subject when in Seistan. Your reply 'was, as far as I remember, that though strictly speaking the Bank were precluded from taking up this sort of work by their charter, yet you thought that now the Russian Convention had been signed, no one would be likely to raise any objection to their ordering goods from India and England, or transacting Agency work for English buyers of Persian products. It was only my further suggestion that the Bank should open a sample room that you demurred to, on the grounds that your staff was insufficient, etc. A case in point was that of the carpets which I understood you would be ready to purchase and forward for English buyers. The actual arrange ment you suggested (your letter 13th January) was that you could make advances to the Mustaufi under a credit opened in his favour by purchasers. I did not of course mean to suggest that you should actually purchase the goods yourself at your own risk. Is there any reason why you should not undertake similar Agency as regards other Kain products should there be a demand for them from England ? I presume the Bank will continue to keep an Agent at Birjand after Howson leaves ? It would not be at all difficult for him to get such orders executed through local Persian firms. I may mention that I reported the conversation I had with you on this subject to the Government of India and I believe the India Office lave addressed the Bank with a view of their definitely authorising you to extend the Bank’s business in this way. It was, I think, to some considerable extent as a result of my report on this point that the Government of India have 1556 F. D. 1 /10 urged on the Secretary of State the continuance of their arrangement with the Bank even at the cost of paying an increased subsidy. In connection with this proposal, I have asked the Government of India to sanction the maintenance of Consulate sample rooms for Seistan and Birjand, this being the detail you said you would be unable to manage. _About the I unjab Bank’s Agency at Nusbki, I have so far heard nothing. The Mustaufi and Ali Akbar were very pleased with their last venture to India in spite of the delays. thought my log of a week or so ago made quite clear the conditions under which this business would be undertaken when ordering of the goods has nothin' to do with me whatever. When Ali Akbar lets me know from whom he is going to purchase goods I will simply ask the Bank at that place to buy a bill against the invoices when I hear that 25 per cent, plus 15 per cent, for transport! etc., has been deposited is all that a Bank can be expected to do. When ordering the goods he must tell the consignees to forward them to us, care of the Punjab Bank, Quetta.” Ends. It will seem that Mr. McMurray’s terms are merely to advance the money for the period from date of purchase to that of delivery against 40 per av'A iu 1 , in a( * vanC0 and the goods as security. I fear this will never suit Ah Akbar knows no firms in England and only Ghazanfur in India. I do not think he will receive interest on the 40 per cent, which he will have to deposit probably some time before the goods are actually paid for while at the same tune he will certainly have to pay interest on the total purchase money. * I understood from McMurray’s previous message that he wanted a deposit of only 26 per cent, on the total cost. ^ From His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Seistan and Kain, Camp Salmabad, To—The Manager, Imperial Bank of Persia, Seistan.

If I did useNotb.— Mr. Howson as the Bank's Agent senld not take instructions from me. Mr. How- ■on’s log to Mr. McMurray was the result of a oonrsrsation with me. R. L. Kbnniok. The question of ordering g ods for merchants was never spoken of to my knowledge until your arrival in Birjand, when, if you remember, Howson logged asking me if I could undertake such business and on what terms. This did not look as if I had already given jou an undertaking previously to do this work, as you evidently think I did. The terms I offered I consider were very reasonable indeed, for it must be remembered that besides the advance of 75 per cent, of cost I would have to put out a great deal of money before the goods came into my posses sion, such as freight, Indian Customs duty, camel hire and Persian Customs duty. No trader in any part of the world ever get such favourable terms from a Bank, in fact would never ask to expect such. You must also remember that you are asking me to deal with people who have still a reputation to make and of whose means and standing I know nothing. In making advances to them I am therefore taking more than ordinary risk. It must not be thought for a moment th^t the mere holding of the goods plus a deposit of 25 per cent, would anything like cover the Bank from loss in case anything should happen to the consignees to prevent their taking delivery of the merchandise. The very most that such mer chandise would fetch if offered for sale by the Bank, would be 60 per cent, to 76 per cent, of the original cost. That is to say, the Bank would lose all the money it had expended on the goods from the time they left the manufacturers until they came into possession here besides interest on the total cost, and would have to wait months, probably years, before realizing anything at all on the goods. These are contingencies that a Banker must always bear in mind and I may say I have heard of exactly the same sort of thing as this happen with merchants of much greater financial capacity than. Ali Akbar Ismail or any other Birjand merchant. There must always be a certain amount of risk attached to any profitable business, I admit, but in this case I would be taking a maximum of risk and a minimum of profit. In fact, the profit would be just the same as on an ordinary loan on which we insist on having two independent guarantors, so that the risk is very small. You seem to have taken a very one-sided view of the case, forgetting to look at it from our point of view at all. You say in your log of to-day that merchants must do their buying through Agents. I see no reason why they should not do so. Eor their Indian require ments I would recommend them to Bradford &amp; Co., Bombay, who make a speciality of this kind of work ; in fact, the senior partner of the firm came up the route and on to Meshed on purpose to study the question. Their terms are 9 per cent, interest from the date they pay for the goods until approximate date of arrival of return remittance in Bombay plus com mission and, of course, all packiug charges. Indents, I believe, may be sent to them in Persian. They have Agents in London, who, I daresay, could execute orders in England, but, if not, there are Persian firms who would no doubt be able to do so. I have mentioned this firm to you once or twice and told you that some of the Indian merchants had sent their indents to them and also one or two Persians. If they can do so I cannot see why the Birjand people should not do the same. I don’t think you can call this Branch of the Bank a “ spoon fed ” concern. If it is the spoon must be a very small one and even then a con siderable quantity of the food must get upset before it reaches the mouth. As you must know it was only under great pressure from the Government of India that we consented to come here at all and our reluctance has been only too fully justified by the results to date. I heard from Mac Bean the other day that he only awaits final arrange ments before sending an Agent to Nushki. This ought to make a very great difference to trade.Dated Camp Salmabad, the 19th July 1908. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Seistan and Kain, To—The Manager, Imperial Bank of Persia, Seistan.

I could of course do it, but as I think 1 pointed out the merchants will lose 3 per cent, by doing it this way, it would be more businesslike if they sent the deposit direct to Bradford and Co., through me, but just as they prefer. Referring to second last paragraph of your letter, you have again misunder stood w r hat I said. Please refer to my letter of 13th January, in which I clearly told you to what extent I could assist. Dated Seistan, 27th July 1908. From—The Manager, Imperial Bank of Persia, Seistan, To—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Seistan and Kain. I received your letter of 19th instant the day before yesterday ani, while I agree with you that there is nothing to be gained by continuing an unprofit able discussion, it is impossible for me to let it rest as it is. In the second paragraph of your letter you affirm that I did undertake to obtain goods for merchants through my Agents at Bombay or London by accepting indents and sending them on. This is quite a different thing to what you asked me to do, viz., order goods from samples. The latter I told you I was unwilling to undertake because it was not in my power to do so, but in my first log on this subject I agreed to accept indents. Previous to this log I repeat that I made no promise of the kind to you in Seistan. Spinning machines are quite a different thing; I ordered those just as I would a topee or a box of sparklets for anybody who asked me. In the second last paragraph of your letter you say that you gathered that I was prepared to accept indents for carpets, pass them on to local firms for compliance, and make advances, on the goods being handed over. Again it would appear you have misunderstood, but, luckily in this case, I put my pro posal on paper, vide my letter to you of 13th January last. If the merchants can find a market for carpets or other products they can export them and draw bills on the consignees which I will collect for them while the business is still in the experimental stage. When a regular and profitable trade has been established, however, the Bank would have no hesitation in buying the bills if they were drawn on good firms. In the case of carpets, the merchants would have nothing to fear. If there is a market for them the importers will make their own arrangements for payment: the manufacturers will only have to pack them and, in all probability, hand them over to me, and I shall dispose of them as the buyers wish. The mode of payment will be arranged between the buyer and seller, the Bank being the medium. This in fact should apply to all exports from here, but as I say, the purchaser will make his own arrangements^ and for the present there is no need to worry about it.It would simplify matters a great deal and show more real keenness on the part of traders if they would send their own agents to India to sell their goods and with the proceeds make the required purchases in India and forward them in the ordinary way. If their imports exceed the exports their agent could draw on them telegraphically or otherwise and the money be remitted through me, just as a Bunjar merchant here does regularly. This latter is a man who does^a hundred times more trade than all the merchants of Seistan put to gether and yet asks for no artificial assistance. You say this question of agency is most important and the future of our trade will depend largely on how it is solved. I cannot agree with you, in fact, I consider the whole think a huge mistake. By introducing a fourth party you can only increase the value of goods, and the very first thing to consider, if you wish to assist a struggling trade to compete wuth Russian, is, how to land your goods at such a price as will enable you to meet the oppositions on equal terms. This can never be achieved, in the manner you suggest. If Russian trade is Bounty fed and our Government wish to oust or even compete with it they must adopt the same tactics, although nothing, in my opinion, but natural trade will ever stand the test of time. I am awfully sorry, Major, I cannot assist you more in your endeavour to increase trade, hut the idea seems to me wrong and no lasting good to trade will ever come of it. Log telegram, dated the 27th July 1908. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan and Kain, Camp Salmabad, To—The Manager, Imperial Bank of Persia, Seistan. Your letter of 13th January refers only to the single instance of carpets and does not say if you are able to assist in any way prospective English buyers of other local products of which specimens have been sent home. Can you not in any way act as an intermediary between English buyers and Persian firms ? It is next to impossible for English houses to have dealings with Persians without such assistance. Log telegram, dated the 28th July 1908. From—The Manager, Imperial Bank of Persia, Seistan, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan and Kain. Your log of yesterday. If English firms care to send their orders through me simply to be passed on accepting all responsibility as to the quality, quantity, etc., I shall be pleased to pay for the goods if they instruct me to do so. I cannot undertake even to look at the things, as I am not competent to pass an opinion on any local product of Seistan or Kain. I once inspected and passed an opinion on a quantity of wool which left here, and although it looked perfectly good wool to me the opinion of the purchasers wiien it reached its destination was that it was very inferior, and out of 14,000 lbs. weight 2,000 lbs odd stones and other things were extracted. Naturally I don’t want to have anything to do with local products acrain. If firms in England are willing to run the risk of this sort of thing happening good and well I will do what I can, but it must be clearly understood that my opinion is absolutely without value. You must also remember that I am liable to be transferred in the Autumn and my successor may know even less than I do about this sort of thing. At the best it can only be done as an experiment and to a very limited extent as the Bank cannot afford to increase the staff here, and if the business assumed large proportions it would be impossible to cope with it. CALCUTTA : PRINTED BY SUPDT. GOVT. PRINTING, INDIA, 8, HASTINGS STREET.17 i ' Telegram No. 11-Camp, dated the 16th November 1908. From—The Foreign Secretary, Camp, To—The Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, Quetta. Government of India will be glad to have your views on Major Kennion’s letter No. K.-115, dated 12th August 1908, copy of which has been forwarded to you by that officer.2 local trade by assisting traders with all necessary information; by the exhibit of samples, and by obtaining goods for them from the European firms on the payment of some percentage of the purchase price, the goods themselyes being subsequently held as guarantee for payment of the remainder. They have a branch at Karachi which gives them important facilities in the matter of receiving and forwarding goods from Europe. They have banking transactions with the Imperial Rank of Persia and it ^ill be as easy for them to continue the same at Seistan with the branch of that Bank at Meshed as they now do at Quetta with the Seistan branch. 6. The question of the extent to which Government should guarantee a new Bank and Trade Agency at Seistan is one which I will not deal with here, but the grant to them of the guarantee now given to the Seistan branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia would at first sight appear sufficient and be likely to be accepted. I am not fully aware of the title of the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Bank buildings in Seistan, and whether they are wholly Bank property or belong in whole or part to Government. Their transfer in either case to a new Bank should present no great difliculty, but if they belong wholly to the Imperial Bank of Persia, then great initial cost would necessitate some assis tance being given by Government towards their acquisition by the new Bank. 7. I am confident that the institution of a combined Bank and Trading Agency at Seistan will lead to satisfactory results by giving Persian traders the.information and assistance, the want of which at present hampers their individual efforts to deal with business firms in India and Europe. Their ignorance of our business methods, of how to arrange for the conveyance of their goods to and from India by road and rail, and of the English language necessary for direct business transactions amount under present conditions to an effective obstacle to trade. A Trade Agency on the lines indicated bv Major Kennion will remove this and afford a great impetus to trade. 8. Among the seven proposals made by Major Kennion in paragraph 3 of his letter two, i.e. Nos. (1) and (4), refer to Kain. He advocates the institution of a Vice-Consulate and a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Biriand. As regards the Vice-Consulate I have long considered that this is a necessary measure but as the matter is one of a political nature it falls outside the scope of this letter which deals with commercial questions and I need say no more about it. * 9. Birjand is, as Major Kennion states, more important commercially than Seistan, but in order to demonstrate its importance it is not necessary to minimise the potential possibilities of Seistan. In considering any measures for the promotion of trade in one of these two places full consideration should be given to the requirements of the other and whatever is done for the one place should be done for the other. It is most essential to open a Bank in Birjand but still more so to open a combined Bank and Trade Agency there. If the Imperial Bank of Persia cannot be prevailed upon, to do this in Seistan I would deprecate their beino* asked to institute a branch for merely banking business in Birjand. On the other hand if the Punjab Banking Company or any other firm can be induced to take the place of the Imperial Bank of Persia in Seistan and start a Trade Agency there, they should be asked as a necessary condition of Government assistance or guarantee, to also open a branch on the same lines in Biriand. Their doing so will go far to ensure the financial success of the venture as a whole. ^ The fact of Seistan being the Head-Quarters of the British Consulate of Seistan and Kain and the existence of the large Bank buildings at Seistan, would necessitate that place remaining the principal branch of the new Bank and Trade Agency and the Birjand branch should at first at any rate be subor dinate to it. It might be sufficient in the first instance to open at Birjand with a small establishment, until the success of that branch suggests or neces sitates further development.»i br “■ i ' k “'»' “• '»»-»* (1) A Trade Agency has recently been established at Nushki at our down bv Tba^Jin' 1 ^^^ Bankln S C^pany.

It would, they said, suit them better to defer definite action in the matter of taking over should such be decided upon, until next autumn, as the -Bank Manager they would select for the new branch is at present on leave. 7. It will be seen from the above that as far as the Punjab Banking Com- pany is concerned no difficulty will be found in replacing the Imperial Bank °! P ersia Seistan by a Bank and Trade Agency suited to the requirements ot the country, and by whose assistance we may confidently hope for the satisfactory developement of trade between India and Persia. I would suggest that, unless the Imperial Bank of Persia are willing to depart widely from their established principles and undertake the Trade Agency business that the Punjab Banking Company are willin'* to do arrangements be made in time for the latter to take their place in Seistan next autumn. o. it nas been laid down as the * Pide letter No. 116-F. from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul in Seistan, dated the 13th January 1908.

Sir, Gamp Bamrud, 17th June 1S09. on I iiave tie honour to request a reference to corres pondence ending with my despatch Ho. 1 , dated 22nd January, the subject of the functions of the Geistan branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia. On Lir. liuson’ s arrival in oeistan, I discussed with Mm the proposals I leva made as to tie nature and extent of the help the Branch should afford to Indian trade in Seistan. Before mahing up his mind on the points raised, hr. huson decided to wait and gain some experience of the working of the branch and tie general condition of things in these provinces; and as I was shortly leaving Beistan for tie Kainat, he promised to let me have his matured opinion in writing. This he has lately sent me in the shape of a copy of a note addressed by him to the Tehran Management, which I sul omit herewith for /our information. It will be remembered that apart from the question of loans, the suggestions under discussion with the Imperial Bank lor the improvement of our trade resolved themselves into three. (•) that the Imperial Bank at Birjand and 3e istan shouldshould procure to order goods for Persian traders on certain conditions as regards a deposit etc., and should similarly act as .Agents for firms in India and Sngland for the purchase of local goods. (0) that ii. they were not prepared to concern them selves in trading matters to this extent, they should pass on and prepay indents on approved firms in India and England with out resposijility as to execution; and in conjunction with the Punjab Bank, which nas established a forwarding agent at Ikishki, undertake the Agency for importing the goods, i. e . payment of railway and forwarding charges at Uushki, clearing from Customs and payment of duty and forwarding charges at Geistan. (c) a third and still less ambitious proposal, in tiie case of the Bank preferring to have nothing whatever to do with indents t&gt;r their payment, was that the Branch should merely carry out the importing hgency as specified in brief in (b) above• xliat a single importing hgency is necessary is, I think, convincingly shown by a consideration of the number of separate transactions a Birjand trader lias to arrange before he can get up goods from an Indian sea-port. He must ( 1 ) find an agent at the sea-port that will under- stand Persian requirements in general and Uis client's in particularparticular : buy in the cheapest oarket ; get sealed for drawbacks in the customs house for Persia and despatch by rail tii© goods indented for. ( 2 ) arrange with the Punjab Bank's agent at Kushki for the clearance of his goods from the railway ; their examination and repacking when necessary ; the prepay ment of transport charges to Koh-i-Ualik 3 iah, and the proper carrying out of the conditions laid down in the camel contract. (3) arrange at oeistan for the despatcli of sanels to meet the consignment at Koh-i-Ualik 3 iah and the prepayi^nt of the cliarges for tiie same. (4) arrange at Koh-i-I&amp;lik 3iah for receipt of tiie goods from the Kushki contractor and the letters discharge and the handing over of the consignment to the Seistan contractor. (5) arrange for the clearance of his goods from tue customs house at Seistan or at Koh-i-iJalik 3 iah ; the payment of dues and the remittance of funds for this purpose. ( 6 ) in the case of goods sent by oeistan, which is the route which, on account of the difficulty of clearing goods at Koh-l-iSallk and in spite of its risks, is at present preferred, the trader must also arrange for the inspection ofr'v enclosed.: % the seals on his goods at the British Consulate to make good Ms claim for drawback. A similar number of agencies lias to be invoked in tae case of exports; and considering that each Agency \except the last-named) requires a deposit of money in advance, it will be admitted that the difficulties in the way of trade with xiidia are at present very serious, while trade direct wita England is practically impossible. To come to tlr. Jluson* s conclusions, it will be oeen in one first place that he is xxbx adverse to the Banks having anything to do with the placing of indents, or pay ment for them - except in the usual course of a Bank's business. Ur. buson's attitude of mind on this point has, I think, been induced chiefly by seeing the dissatisfaction tae bank's first venture in this line gave to their clients wide hr. howson's letter referred to by him. No. 20, dated 15tn march 1909). It is an attitude that is not in my opinion justified. The real cause of the undertaking *• alludeu to uaving proved a comparative failure must lie attri- outed eitiier to the Bank’s negligence in having given their Bombay agents insufficient or incorrect instructions or to the latter having failed to zaxzjdt carry them out, or perhaps to both caused i’hat it was not due to any fundamental causecause or one wi^ich could not be rectified m future quite clear from the fact that in suit* or ‘■wb in spxoe of tne very stupid .isUta tu.

This being the opinion of the local manager, the attitude which the Tearan management has hitherto maintained in the matter is not / o undeigo any cuange and there seems little use in discussing points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) further. mr.

T ° 2ariV on taa • 1 ° enG ^ suggested, the Bank staff would require an additional member at both Geistan and Birjand. I think however that the addition to the clerical staff should preferably oe in the shape of two good Snglish speaking Indian/ (on say Krana 200/- per mensem each),than in additions to the Ungiish staff. This plan would over be cheaper. (2) does not I think stand in need of serious refutation. his Majesty's Consulate at Geistan and the Political hgency at Chageh have been connected with the organisation of the trade route for some years without so far as I am aware suffering any loss in prestige or popular ity and there seems no reason wiv any such results should be feared by the Imperial Bank fro^ similar connection. As regards (3), proposals are under consideration for the establishment of a customs bureau at Birjand which •ould of course do away with the necessity for vicarious clearing on beimlf of Birjand traders at Geistan. should however this not be sanctioned and the necessity continue forfor 3irjand goods to be cleared In Ceistan, I can scarcely tmnk tliat tile Branch Manager would wish to put forward seriously tha abstruseness of the Persian Customs Tariff as a valid reason for declining this very essential part of the suggested agency work - provided of course tiiat the objec tion regarding want of establishment were removed. In the concluding part of his note, Ih*. iluson points out tiiat the great drawback of the trade route is the want of coordination between the various transport arrange- ment s. Tuis is of course quite correct. The most satis factory plan of all would be - not, as | 4 r. Huson suggests, that transport arrangements should be initiated and c pleted at Koh-i-Ualik Jiah - but tiiat the Railway which om- carries the goods from the seaport should also land them at Ceistan, Birjand or Meshed and be able to quote through rates. But in present circumstances this is impossible. ^ 1183 n0t 9Ven been found possible to get one camel con tractor to agree to take goods from Hushki further than the Persian frontier. The nearest approach to coordination that existing circumstances permit is, I believe, to be A found in the establishment of an Agency that would work the facilities already offered in the way of Rail way concessionsA possible plan and canel contracts to the best advantage. suggested by me at first concurred in by the bank’s Geistan Agent was t^iat tais Agency should be undertaken by the Imperial bonk on the Persian side, as on the Indian side it iia^ neen undertaken by the Punjab banking Company. In view however of the general attitude of the Directors of the bank with regard to the functions of the Geistan Branch - which io not lively be modified by the conclusion now submitted, to them by til© Geistan Manager - it now seems that this idea, which was mainly dictated by a desire to - - m£ ensxajo. make use of existing machinery, is not destined to bear fruit and that to attain the object in view we must look elsewhere. 2 Ha am, etc., Gd v - R.

Imperial -iuson, Manager,/Bank of Persia, Geistan. In u.ie last two iialf-/early reports of this Brancii, reference was made to the inception and outcome respectively of an experimental importation by the Bank of sundry goods lor some Birjand merchants. mere loan ts liad previously, e unjiKrtwa understand, been accustomed to import Indian goods on their own behalf, through the medium of a commissio/ agent in Bombay, s^thflt the Bank*a assistance was presumably only enlisted, with a view to working on a large scale. As t.ie jank was taking the responsibility of placing and paying for the indent, it naturally preferred to entrust t.ie execution to a firm (heasrs. Bradford and Company, Bombay/ of widen it had had previous experience, rather than to the Birjand merolumts own agent, of whom it knew little or nothing. Unfortunately, judging by the event its confidence in Bradford and Company appears to have been mis placed. 7/e attach herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. hows on, which speaks for itself. T »7e suggest therefore that the Bank should confine itself in future to stimulating trade by the provision of financial facilities only, leaving the traders to deal directdirect with their own agents as far as the placing and execution of their indents are concerned. Of course, if the Indian Government can persuade some reliable firm of Commission ^ents to statioiWown representative in Birjand with a view to pushing trade, so much the better. The Bank is however not, we think, suited to act in such a capacity, not necessarily because it is a Bank, but because it would be at the mercy of others as regards the proper execution of its orders. In short, the position would entail responsibility without control. The financial facilities referred to above would naturally take the usual form of remitting money on behalf of the indenter or collecting it on belialf of the consigner. In any case where it might be considered safe and desirable to give the indents financial assistance . on the security of the goods ordered by him, the Bank should of course make it clear A to the consigner tiiat it retained and lieu on the goods, or upon any funds advanced therefor, in the event of the order being cancelled etc. As regards the proposal put forward with our Uote A of 5th December 1908, that the Bank should act as clearing and forwarding agents (in cooperation with the Punjab Banking Company Limited} the principal objections are (1) Expense of1 ^ 1 ^——' ■■ -—at appear to be inevitable. It is obvious tiaat in Birjand, apart from an/ question of clearing the goods, a great deal of extra work would be thrown on our representative there, who must already have his hands pretty full as British Agent, Bank Correspondent, and Tele graphist. lie would certainly require extra local assistance, as special registers etc. would have to be kept, to prevent confusion of* accounts. It is of course evident that one great drawback to this Trade Route is the difficulty of coordinating the diverse transport arrangements. As Birjand is the real objective, it seems to us it would be advisable that the arrangements for transport (from Kon-i-Ualik 3iah to the North) should be x/ni/uCtta imitated and completed there, and not in Basratabad. Probably also it would assist matters if a forwarding clerk were sta tioned at koh-i-iialik Ciah, though doubtless this is not s essential as it was at Uushki. r/Copy of a letter Uo. 20/20, dated Birjand, 15th IJarcii 1909. From - Mr. VJ m R. Rowson, British ^gent, Birjand, To The Manager, Imperial Bank of Persia, Beistan. Dear Sir, reference o/l 56/158, No. 3/o07, Packing . I Deg to make the following remarks with to Messrs. Bradford and Company's letter No. dated the 3rd of December 1908, and their invoice dated the Snd of December 1908. Vide Major Vebb 7/are'a letter No. 2222, dated i«u£liki the 7th of December 1908, to tne address of Messrs. Bradford and Company, the packing was evidently not suitable for even a journey by steamer and rail to say nothing about long camel journey, The cost of/packing at Dushki and a Ceistan has been borne by the importers and a reference to the accounts will show that the amount charged is a considerable one. Moreover, the faulty packing has resulted in the caravan oeing delayed en_route for over a month to enable repairs to oe earned out. A caravan which was despatched from Bombay a month later with similar goods reached Birjand and the goods were put on the market before the arrival of those from Messrs. Bradford and Company. Besides the defects in packing pointed out by1800 l^ajor T/ebb Uare, a still more serious one was not dwelt on by liim owing, of course, to bis not iiaving opened tiie packages. Tills is that a large quantity of silk embroidered satin was packed in ordinary gunny. As this cloth cost as much as Rs. 2/ - and more per yard, Messrs. Bradford and Company might have iiad it packed in boxes. tlany pieces of this cloth have arrived here badly stained due to the percolation of rain through the outer gunny covering. PRICES . llessrs. Bradford and Company have stated in their letter quoted above that they secured all the piece- g o ods ”at_ the lowest price s that have ruled this year on the cloth market” . Messrs. Ali Akbar Ismail of Birjand and Jawala Singh of Seistan were able to procure Crey n T t1 cloth, Rupee ticket, through their Bombay Agents, at Rs. 4/14/- and Rs. 4/l3/- per piece respectively; whereas Llessra• Bradford and Company bought theirs at Rs. 5/1/- per piece. All purchases were made about the same time : in fact Ali Akbar's consignment reached Birjand before that from Llessrs. Bradford and Company. Tue following items will be seen in the invoice 1600 lbs. country yarn &amp; Rs.0/4/l8 cents per lb. Rs. 688/4/0. 1600 lbs. country yarn Q Rs.0/4/21 cents per lb.

I understand the cents are divisions of the anna ; but if so, the totals have been incorrectly calculated. I asked IZr. Hart by wire to enquire about this; but have not yet received a reply from him. TEA, The quantities indented for were Tea, black (called cliai qalani-i-siah-i- Galcutta), 50 boxes 5000 lbs. Tea, Java (called lamsa), 220 boxes 2200 lbs. The quantities sent by hessrs. Bradford and Company were Black Tea 2520 lbs. Java Tea 6320 lbs. with the result that insufficient black tea, of which there is a large consumption in Birjand, and too much Java tea has reached the merchants. They will suffer a considerable loss on the Java tea as there is not a great demand for this article. /0 The merchants wanted 220/lb. boxes, whereas Messrs. Bradford and Company understood the larger boxes each of which co nta ins, four 10 lb boxes. If the firm was not aware of the way in which Java tea is packed, they should havehave allowed themselves to he influenced by the number of lbs. which was clearly jnarked in tne Indent under the column 'quantity” or have telegraphed for instructions. Is it not possible for the merciiants to be compensated by hesars. Bradford and Company for the loss entailed by the supply of a larger quantity of Java tea than that ordered ? Thien the hank decided to advance the money for goods imported from India, hr. tic hurray strongly recommended 0 at orders should be placed with Lessrs. Bradford and Company vide ^is letter dated 11th July 1908 to hajor Kennion, hie Britannic Llajesty’s Consul, Seistan. If for no other reason, 1 think tiie Bank should try to obtain the compensation. 3o far as the merchants of Birjand are concerned I tn±nii 1 may safely say that Lessrs. Bradford and Company will not be again favoured with any further orders. I esti mated that, if tlie caravan under question had been a success, at least about Rs. 100,600 worth of goods would liave been im ported during the ensuing winter from that fim. Under tne heading, 'Rri/ces', I have only t commented on the price of Grey 'T' cloth, although there are several other items which compare unfavourably with those obtained by H. IS. ii. Ghazanfar, the Gombay .Agent of All AkbarAkbar Ismail Tiie faulty execution of tiie Birjand order by ilessrs.

Sir: - With reference to your letter of August 6th res pecting the discontinuance of the branch of the Imper ial Bank of p ersia at Nasratabad I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to inform you that a letter has been received at this Department from Sir T.Jack- son stating that on his return to London early in Sep tember he will consult his colleagues on the Board of Directors of the Bank as to what further steps seem desirable in the circumstances. Sir T. Jackson also states that there has been an improvement in the results shewn by the operations of the branch since His Majesty's Consul in Seistan made his report in August 1907 and he adds that as Mr. Hawkins, who has been sent to Persia to investigate the affairs of the Bank, will be back in London to- T ^e Under Secretary of State, India Office.

GODL &lt; « toder Seoretary of State, Foreign Offioe.;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] WITH reference to your despatch No. 2 of the 8th January last, inclosing copy of a letter from the Imperial Bank of Persia respecting the Nasratabad branch of the bank, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan whom I requested to furnish a report upon the working of the bank. Major Kennion’s despatch was submitted to Mr. Rabino, for his observations, which appear marginally upon the despatch in question, and I further inclose a letter from Mr. Hawkins, a member of the London Board of Directors of the bank, now in Tehran, whose opinion I asked in regard to the correspondence. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 12, dated the 12th February last, regarding the working of the Nasratabad branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, with inclosures (returned herewith). I am directed to state what, in my opinion, are the reasons for which this branch has been working at a loss, and to suggest means by which it might be possible to remedy this state of affairs. I would remark, in the first place, that the Memorandum of working expenses inclosed with your despatch does not convey a just idea of the return on the capital actually employed on banking transactions. Money was spent on a site, buildings, and furniture, altogether out of proportion to the amount of business a bank could expect to transact in Seistan. The buildings included two good houses, one of which is occupied by the Manager and his wife, the other by the Vice-Consul and Consulate Doctor, besides an office, servants’ quarters, &amp;c. The area taken up is in excess of what was necessary, and was, I understand, only acquired as it might otherwise have been purchased by the Russians. The excessive price paid for the land (5 krans per zer) must have been due to a similar reason, for 2 krans per zer, the rate at which the Consulate land was bought, is certainly not low.' 1 ' Thus, of the capital of 10,0001. allotted to the branch, some 5,0001. was initial expenditure, while a similar sum represents the actual working capital in the Manager s control. The cost of buildings and furniture is, it seems, written off at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, the charge being added to the working expenses of ^the bank. Repairs to the same form another annual charge, so that in twenty years time the houses will stand as an asset to the bank, paid for entirely by the earnings of the local branch. Though I understand that this is in accordance with commercial custom, it is, to my mind, questionable whether it is correct to show the charge as a working expense under the special circumstances of the case. Since the branch is maintained mainly at the expense of the Government of India, it seems to me that either the buildings should, at the expiry of the twenty years, become their property, or that the building fund should be kept entirely separate from the profit and loss account or the branch. Burdened as at present it is by the charges referred to, the local brancii can hardly be expected to work otherwise than at a loss. * Our hands were forced; land could only be bought from the Government, who imposed their conditions.—J.R.

Consul Reunion to Mr. Marling. (No. 17.) Sir, Seistan, March 30, 1908. [1848/—5]2 As regards the question why the gross earnings of the branch are not higher, T •would submit the following observations: With a working capital of 5,000Z. the branch earned: Year endinar September 1904 1905 ” ”, „ 1906 1907 i- s. 1 16 240 4 353 12 391 0 d. 2 9 5 0 There has thus been a steady, if slow, increase, last year’s figures amounting to hc' D made ^very rapidly. There is, however, a very limited demand for this class of business inILtan, and till within the last year a considerable portion of the working capital was, I believe, lying idle. Another class of more could have been made, and, in my opinion, oug ■ .i following loans to Persians of position. During the year under report and since the following loans made by the branch came to my know lec ge . 1. June 1907.— The Shaukat-ul-Mulk, 40,000 krans at 12 per cent., payable m fourteen days^er 190 7._Shaukat-ul-Mulk, 20,000 krans at 12 per cent., payable in two “ 01 ^ ruary 1 g 0 g_—Shaukat-ul-Mulk, 30,000 krans at 18 per cent., payable in fiftee 4. February 1908.-Naib of Darmian, 5,000 krans at 15 per cent., payable in ‘’''^'February 1908.-Serdar Pasand Khan, 3,000 krans, interest and period m ' k Thesc were all recovered when due without difficulty; 4 and 5 are not yet due. The following are among the applications for loans which were refused . 1 April 1907 —Shaukat-ul-Mulk, 150,000 krans for six to twelve months. 2. June 1907 .—Shaukat-ul-Mulk, 50,000 krans for two months. (Applied for •after the loan of 40,000 krans had been repaid.) . 3. June 1907 .—Malek-et-Tujjar, 30,000 krans for three months. 4. June 1907.—Mustaufi, 30,000 krans for three months. 5 August 1907.—Naib of Darmian, 3,000 krans for three months. g! November 1907 .-Malek-et-Tujjar, 20,000 krans for four months 7. February 1908.—Mustaufi, Birjand, 10,000 krans for three months. (The t latter were intended for purchasing trade goods in India.) The security offered in each case was, I believe, sufficient to satisfy the local Manager, but the sanction of the head office was refused. The reason assigned for these refusals was the disturbed state of Persia. Their caution may or may not be instilled It is, at the same time, noteworthy that Kain and Seistan have been among the quietest districts in Persia. What I cannot help thinking may have had more to say to the bank’s attitude is that the local branch’s capital would have been insufficient to‘'furnish these loans without crippling themselves as regards the exchange business, and that the head office was unwilling to withdraw capital from branches doing more paying kind of business to enable the Seistan branch to transact business of a ess paying kind.® I would observe that though loans are considerably less remunera ive than exchange transactions, yet they return not less than 12 to 18 per cent, as well as the commission on the draft, by which the money is remitted to lehran or Meshed as the case may be, for they are rarely required for local use. I think'it probable that the branch could have increased its earnings it it had to some extent imitated the Russian Bank in setting up a commercial agency supple mentary to theif exchange business with India.t In this connection I would request a reference to Sir II. McMahon’s diary for the period ending the 24th November, 1903. Another reason for the earnings of the branch being smaller than they need have Been is that though at the outset the possibilities of Birjand were ^cognized- Mr. Newell in his letter of the 22nd July, 1904, to the Foreign Office correctly refeired * * No. Seistan can have any amount of capital from Tehran.—J.R. f Events have proved, as we have maintained, that this class of business is unsound.-V.A.G.H.3 /y. ij m [ f l\j 1 done so, it is my belief the profits of the Seistan branch wonld iderably larger than they are. ggestions for the future. In February 1907 an agency to the z^nsrarted at Birjand in charge of Mr. Howson. This has proved very portant place than Nasratabad as a trade distributing centre ”— e of 1906 to 1907, showed little energy in pushing their business r-crxxxm WZ successful, and business has increased in a very satisfactory manner. Mr. Macmurray, the local Manager, is hopeful that with the assistance of this agency there will be no loss on the working of the branch for the current year.* Lately, however, the operations of the branch have been cramped for want of capital. Many applications for drafts on India have been received at Birjand, but owing to the branch’s want of funds in India,* the rates quoted were too high and no business ensued. Want of funds in Meshed and Seistan have similarly resulted in applications for drafts on these places being refused. It is obvious that in order to give the branch a fair chance of paying its way it should not be starved of funds. My suggestion is therefore that the capital of the Seistan branch should be increased to admit of an increase in the exchange business as well as to provide for loans. The successful result of the Birjand agency under Mr. Howson, the greater part of whose time is taken up with other work, indicates that it would be advisable for the bank to have a properly qualified agent at this place. From a commercial point of view, it would indeed have been better that Birjand should have been made the local head-quarters of the branch from the first, but this is now out of the question owing to the amount of capital sunk in land and buildings in Seistan. For the present the agent at Birjand should be a native of Persia on moderate pay. A house could be rented for him in the city; so no expenditure on land or buildings would be necessary. The others means by which, in my opinion, the profits of the branch could be increased have already been indicated in the part of this letter dealing with causes of past failure. My recommendations may be summarized as under :— 1. The working capital of the branch should be increased. 2. Loans should not be refused if, in the opinion of the local Manager, the security offered is sufficient. 3. The Manager should be authorized to carry on an agency business for the supply of British Indian goods on the Russian deposit system. 4. A properly qualified agent should be appointed to Birjand. The political aspect of the question, with special reference to 2 and 3 above, have been dealt with in my letters No. 162, dated the 24th August, 1907, and No. 27, dated the 31st January last, to the Government of India.

SEISTAN despatch No. 17 of the 30th ultimo, from Major Kennion. Pressure of work has prevented me from giving earlier attention to the above. However, I have gone carefully into it, and cannot but confirm the marginal note placed on it by Mr. Rabino. Major Kennion appears to have formed quite a wrong opinion as regards capital. We would let Seistan have as much capital as the place requires if it could be safely employed ; but that is the rub. Most of the business offering is the loaning out of money to the titled gentry class. Past experience lias proved it to be undesirable, and the present position of the country does not warrant our extending such business. Major Kennion suggests that the Imperial Bank of Persia follow the example of the Russian Bank in setting up a commercial agency, supplementary to general banking business. Major Kennion cannot be cognizant of the colossal losses the Russian Bank3 to it as “a far more important place than Nasratabad as a trade distributing centre ”— the bank, till the middle of 1906 to 1907, showed little energy in pushing their business in this place. Had they done so, it is my belief the profits of the Seistan branch would by now have been considerably larger than they are. I now come to suggestions for the future.

Sir E.Grey has been In communication with Sir T. Jackson on the subject. Sir T. Jackson is very reluctant to withdraw the branch from Seistan, as he is not without hope that it may become self-supporting in the future and he thinks it not improbable that a German Bank with less restrictions as to the class of business dealj with would establish itself in its place. It was pointed out that His Majesty's Government would in any case, be unable to increase the subsidy and Sir Thomas af ter The Under Secretary of Stateafter consulting his hoard has now informed the Sec retary of State that he is willing to maintain the branch with the present subsidy. Sir E.Grey feels that there are great disadvan tages in abandoning a British enterprise of this na ture and he therefore hopes that Lord Morley will see his way to continuing the contribution for two years; when the question can be reconsidered.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Despatch No. 12, dated 12th February 1908, regarding the working of the N. sratabad branch of the Imperial IBank of Persia, with enclo sures.* * Returned herewith. I am directed to state what, in my opinion, are the reasons for which this branch has been working at a loss, and to suggest means by which it might be possible to remedy this state of affairs. I would remark, in the first place, that the memorandum of working expenses enclosed with your Despatch does not convey a ust idea of the return on the capital actually employed in banking transactions. Money was spent on a site, build ings and furniture altogether out of proportion to the amount of business a Bank could expect to transact in Seistan. The buildings included two good houses, one of which is occupied by the Manager and his wife, the other by the Vice-Consul and Consulate doctor, besides an office, servants’ quarters, (tc. The area taken up is in excess of what was necessary and was, I understand, only acquired as it might otherwise have been purchased by the Russians. The excessive price paid for the land (krans 5 per zar) must have been due to a similar reason, for krans 2 per zar, the rate at which the Consulate land was bought, is certainly not low. Thus, of the capital of £10,000 allotted to the branch, some £5,000 was initial expenditure, wTiile a similar sr m represents the actual working capital in the Manager’s contrcl. The cost of buildings and furniture is, it seems, written off at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, the charge being added to the working expenses of the Bank. Repairs to the same form another annual charge, so that in twenty years’ time the houses will stand as an asset to the Bank, paid for entirely' by the earnings of the Deal branch. Though I understand that this is in accordance with commercial custom, it is to my mind questionable whether it is correct to show the charge as a working expense under the special circumstances of the case. Since the branch is mainteined mainly at the expense of the Government of India, it seems to me that cither the buildings should, at the exriry of the twenty years, become their pro perty, or that the building fund should be kept entirely separate from the profit a.id loss account of the branch. Burdened as at present it is by the charges referred to, the local branch can hardly be expected to work otherwise than at a loss. As regards the question why the gross earnings of the branch are not higher, ' I wmuld submit the following observations :— With a working of capital of £5,000 the branch earned:— £ s. d. Year ending September 1904 ..1 16 2 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; „ 1905 ..240 4 9 „ 1903 .. 353 12 5 55 55 „ 1907 .. 391 0 0 There has thus been a steady 7 , if slow, increase, last year's figures amounting to approximately 8 per cent, on the capital employed. ^ The business of the bank is almost entirely confined to exchange buydng and selling drafts and discounting bills. The rates charged by the bank for drafts are high, varying from 1 to 2f per cent., and if business w T ere brisk, money could be made very' rapidly. There is, how^ever, a very limited demand for this class of business in Seistan, and till within the las', year a considerable portion of the work ing capital was, I believe, lydng idle. Another class of business how r ever offered, 67 of wnich more could have been made, and in my opinion ought to have been made. I refer to loans to Persians of position. During the year under report and since the following loans made by the branch came to my knowledge: (1) June 1907. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk (2) September 1907. „ (3) February 1908. „ (4) ,, 1908.

These were all recovered when due without difficulty ; (4) and (5) are not yet due. The following are among the applications for loans which were refused : — (1) April 1907. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk .. Krs. 150,000 for 6 to 12 months. (2) June 1907. „ .. „ 50,000 „ 2 months. (Applied for after the loan of krans 40,000 had been repaid.) (3) June 1907. The Malik-u-Tujjar .. Krs. 30,000 for 3 months. (4) „ 1907. The Mustaufi .. ,, 30,000 „ 3 „ (5) August 1907. The Naib of Darmian .. ,, 3,000 „ 3 „ (6) November 1907. The Malik-u-Tujjar .. „ 20,000 „ 4 „ (7) February 1908. The Mustaufi, Birjand .. „ 10,000 „ 3 „ (The two latter were intended for purchasing trade goods in India.) The security offered in each case was, I believe, sufficient to satisfy the local Manager, but the sanction of the head office was refused. The reason assigned for these refusals was the disturbed state of Persia. Their caution may or may not be justified. It is at the same time noteworthy that Kain and Seistan have been among the quietest districts in Persia. What I cannot help thinking may have had more to say to the Bank’s attitude is that the local branch’s capital would have been insufficient to furnish these loans without crippling themselves as regards the exchange business, and that the head office was unwilling to with draw capital from branches doing the more paying kind of business to enable the Seistan branch to transact business of a less paying kind. I would observe that though loans are considerably less remunerative than exchange transactions, yet they return not less than 12% to 18% as well as the commission on the draft by which the money is remitted to Tehran or Meshed as the case may be, for they are rarely required for local use. I think it probable that the branch could have increased its earnings if it had to some extent imitated the Russian Bank in setting up a commercial agency supplementary to their exchange business with India. In this connection I would request a reference to Sir Henry McMahon’s Diary for the period ending the 24th November 1903. Another reason for the earnings of the branch being smaller than they need have been is that though at the outset the possibilities of Birj and were recognized— Mr. Newell in his letter of July 22nd, 1904, to the Foreign Office correctly referred to it as “a far more important place than Nasratabad as a trade distributing centre”—the Bank, till the middle of 1906-1907, showed little energy in pushing their business in this place. Had they done so, it is my belief the profits of the Seistan branch would by now have been considerably larger than they are. I now come to suggestions for the future. In February 1907 an agency to the Seistan branch was started at Birjand in charge of Mr. Howson. This has proved very successful and business has increased in a very satisfactory manner. Mr. McMurray, the local Manager, is hopeful that, with the assistance of this agency, there will be no loss on the working of the branch for the current year. Lately, how'ever, the operations of the branch have been cramped for want of capital. Many applications for drafts on India have been received at Birjand, but owing to the branch’s want of funds in India, the rates quoted were too high and no business ensued. Want of funds in Meshed and Seistan have similarly resultedin applications for drafts on these places being refused. It is obvious that in order to give the branch a fair chance of paying its way, it should not be starved of funds. My suggestion is therefore that the capital of the Seistan branch should be increased to admit of an increase in the exchange business as well as to pro vide for loans. The successful results of the Birjand Agency under Mr. Howson, the greater part of whose time is taken up with other work, indicate that it would be ad visable for the Bank to have a properly qualified agent at this place. From a commercial point of view, it would indeed have been better that Birjand should have been made the local head-quarters of the branch from the first, but this is now out of the question—owing to the amount of capital sunk in land and build ings in Seistan. For the present, the agent at Birjand should be a native of Persia on moderate pay. A house could be rented for him in the city, so no expen diture on land or buildings would be necessary. The other means by which in my opinion the profits of the branch could be increased have already been indicated in the part of this letter dealing with causes of past failure. My recommendations may be summarised as under:— (1) The working capital of the branch should be inceased. (2) Loans should not be refused if in the opinion of the local Manager the security offered is sufficient. (3) The Manager should be authorised to carry on an agency business for the supply of British Indian goods on the Russian deposit system. (4) A properly qualified agent should be appointed to Birjand. . The political aspect of the question, with special reference to (2) and (3) above, -rk&amp;l 0 ' has been dealt with in my letters No. 162-K., dated 24th August 1907, and dated 31st January 1908, to the Government of India.

KENNiioN, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to request a reference to the Tiade Report of Seistan and Kain for the year 1906-lt)07, which was submitted with my letter No. 161, dated 24th August. 2. It will be seen that the vHue of imports by the Nushhi route amounted to £18,371 only, including those for Meshed : also that there were practically no imports at all for the province of Kain, These figures cannot be considered as other than very unsatisfactory as the result of s&lt; me five years’ endeavours and the expenditure of very considerable sums of money on Consular establishments, a Bank, communications, and miscellaneous concessions; and I therefore think that the time has come when the situation should be reviewed. 3. The causes of tbe failure of the new route are not, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, of a fundamental kind. That is to say, the failure is not due to absence of profits in bringing goods to Persia from India, or vice versa. The road is long and the attendant difficulties great, but there is no question that Indian goods imported by Nushki command prices in Persia which leave a substantial margin of profit after all expenses have been paid. The chief causes of the disappointing results indicated by recent Trade Reports may, I think, be found in the following circumstances. 4. When the Trade Route was first opened, it tvas recognized that the mere construction of a channel, where no channel previously existed, was not sufficient to induce the flow of trade and tliat there was a vis inertice to be overcome on both sides of thb frontier. This, Major Trench set himself to do with great energy. He persuaded a number of Indian firms to embark in trade in Persia, and on the other side got certain Persian traders of Birjand to send caravans to Quetta. The former ventures, owing to a variety of causes which it is here un necessary to examine, but the chief of which seems to have been tbe lack of special qualifications on the part of the agents sent out, were all failures; and the majority of the firms who had taken part in this attempt, retired from tbe field after incurring considerable losses. At the present time, there are no Biitish or British-Indiah traders in Birjand, while those in Seistan may be described as being tbe refuse which remained after the better class traders had retired. The ventures from the Persian side similarly resulted in discomfiture, chiefly owing to bad Agenqy in Quetta; and the Persian trader, an individual of little substance and enterprise, had no heart to continue the experiment. This, then, is the present position of affairs. Indian trade with the ivainat by Nushki is practically nil, while that with Seistan is represented by a few shops whose imports amounted during the year to the paltry figure shown in the Trade Report. 5. The expression I hdve used above regarding the shopkeepers of Seistan requires some justification, more especially as they, together with a few Meshed traders, are the prime beneficiaries of the costly efforts put forward by the Government of India for the encouragement of the Nusliki route. In this connection, I would here qubte from a letter received from the Manager of the Seistan Branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia from which I havs already given excerpts in the Trade Report. “British Indian tradel in Seistan” Mr. Mac Murray writes is rapidly being killed by the Indians in whose hands our interests in that direction are being served, and before saying anything about future prospects, 1 my duty to lay before you my views on tlm manner in which those so-ca e traders have hitherto conducted their business.” “ Trade they have never attempted, and this statement, if lather sweeping, is, I think, borne out by the fact that, while there are seien or eig i o ese 2426 F. D.people here—some of them for over four years—not a single caravan of produce of Seistan has to the best of my knowledge, ever left Seistan for India. Yet in Seis^an, goat and sheep skins and cow hides to the number of at least 300,00O may be bought annually, while wool to the extent of 500 kharwats can be bought cheap enough to realize a handsome profit by rebelling it in Meshed, which is enly the first of three markets it may have to p iss through before reaching its ultimate destination. With regard to skins, I know that a good profit can be made by selling them in Quetta, so that a still greater ^ profit could be made if they were sent direct to consumers. “ It is plain, therefore, that trade has not been given a chance, and anything that the Indians here may say on the subject should not be given a momnut’s consideration. It is the la&gt;t thing they dream of, and they show a marked disinclination to discuss it. They are, in fact, nothing but money h nders, pure and simple, and, as such, have succeeded in getting themselves heartily disliked by the authorities and better class people here owing to the very exhorbitant rates of interest they charge, reaching to, in many instances, I believe, 200 per cent. Eighty per cent, is the lowest I have ever heard of them charging. Altogether they are a disreputable lot of people, and doing infinite damage to British prestige commercially in this part of the world. They all have shops, certainly, but what little stock they contain is the^ery oldest and cheapest they could r &lt;ke up in the Indian bazars, and a great part of which is of German'manufacture. The prices demanded exceed Indian retail prices by over I’OO per cent. It is evident, therefore, these people are not heie for trade purposes.” 6. The views expressed by Mr. MacMurrny are those of everyone who has any first-hand knowledge of Seistan, and I can thoroughly endorse the opinion he expresses that Indian commerce, so far from being benefited by the presence of the shopkeepers now in St istan, is rather discredited thereby. It stands to reason that whilst the spurious traders now in Seistan rely for their profits on usury and the exhorbitant prices which they are enabled to charge by the absence of healthy competition, the trade cannot show signs of increase. To sum up in a word the present situation, though there are Indian shopkeepers in Seistan, there is no trade of ttekind that might benefit both India and Persia, and it foil »ws that if this class of trade is desired, the problem of initiating it will have to be faced de novo. 7. Proceeding on the assumption that trade by this route is an object with the Government of India, the fact first to be noticed is that owing to the failure of the pioneers of the Persian trade by hushki, Seistan now occupies a worse position in the eyes ot the Indian commercial public than it did at the outset. Tbe second is that any expectations based on Persian action or initiative are bound to result in disappointment. To enable Persians to undertake trading operations with India, reliable Persian agents are necessary at Quetta, Bombay and Karachi, both for selling and buying. But there is no trader of sufficient substance in these Provinces to afford to keep agents at these places, or to embark sufficient capital in the trade to make it worth his while to have them, were it otherwise possible. There have been talks of a company being floated in Birjand for tbe purpose, but in the present state of public morality and tbe absense of all legal safeguards for investors, company promotion is an absurdity. The conclusion is unavoidable that the advent in Seistan of one or more good trading firms is the only thing that can give the trade a fresh start. 8. After discussing this question with Mr. MacMurray, of the Imperial Bank, and Mr. Howson (Indian Telegraph Department), who has an intimate knowledge of commercial matters in Birjand, I have arri\ed at tbe opinion that a solution of the difficulty will only be found in the establishment of a Trading Agency—as opposed to merchants with a stock in trade. This might he done either by a Company, or by a private firm or individual, but at the outset at any rate, some support by Government in one form or a no her would be necessary. It is indeed unlikely, for reasons already given, that it could be established wi bout a promhe of such help. It is unnecessary to go into details as to the business such an Agency would find in Seistan and Kain, but the3 following is an outline of some of the most essential features of the trading concern which I have in my mind:— (a) The Agency should have establishments at Seistan and Birjand. (b) Samples of all Indian manufactuies likely to find a maiket in Eastern Persia should be kept on view, and on a deposit being made, these would be obtained from India. (c) A shop should be kept with a stock of the articles in every day demand. (d) The concern must be started with no idea of making profits quickly. Profits should indeed be cut as fine as possible at first, with the object of obtaining a large connection. (e) A business should be made of exporting local products. (f) As local experience is gained, agents should be apj ointed in all big villages, who would be supplied with goods from the head establishments. (g) Later on, advantage might be taken of the cheapness of labour to start a small factory for the manufacture of carpets and woollen goods. (h) The maintenance of skilled workmen on the premises, such as a carpenter and mistri, would be found useful and profitable. (£) In short, the concern should be ready to undertake business of all descriptions, the main principle to be observed being that begin nings should be made on moderate lines—the agency gradually feeling its way to more extended operations. (j) The concern should be the Local Agents of the Imperial Bank of Persia. The last of the suggested functions of the Agency brings me to the question of the assistance to be given by the Government of India, which I have postulated as a necessary part of the scheme. « 9. Amongst other measures taken by the Indian Government for the encouragement of trade in these Provinces, was that of paying a subsidy to the Imperial Bank ot Persia in consideration of their opening a Branch Bank in Nasratabad. A site w^as acquired in 1^03. Bank premises, residences for the Europt an staff, and quarters for the native establishment were erected shortly after, at considerable outlay. The objects with which this Branch Bar k was started were both political and commercial. It was intended, in the first place, to counterbalance the Kussian Bank, as a politic d instrument, and secondly, to assist trade. After being in existence for three years, it must be pronounced a failure in both these capacities. I understand that under its charter, the Imperial Bank is prohibited from taking up business of a commercial kind. Hence it follows that it can be no rival to the Russian Bank whose chief busi ness it is to sell Russian goods. Mr. Mac Murray contrasting the methods of the latter institution with those of our own traders, writes :— ‘‘ Russian trade, on the other hand, is pushed in a most energetic and methodical manner, on the slow but sure, small profit and quick returu princip’e. 'Ihey have Agents in almost every village, who are supplied with goods from the Hussainabad emporium to the value of Tomans 1,000 or 5,000, according to the size and importance of the vilhige, all that is ask&lt; j d of them being a deposit of 20 per cent., or failing that, two guarantors known to the Russian Bank.” . The Nasratabad Branch of the Imperial Bank is also much restricted iu the matter of loans to Governors and Persians of position, which is the other method in which its existence might be of political value. So much is this the case, that the Branch Manager has been w r arned that any such advances he makes will be at his own personal risk, a caution which amounts to a total prohibition. As a commercial concern, the Bank no doubt understands its own business, an I from this point of view it is impossible to criticise.its refusal of loans. What 1 would lay stress on is that as a political asset, beyond the prestige w hich attaches to the maintenance of an empty show at considerablecost—the renown reaped by the builder of a “ folly ”—the Nasratabad Branch is of no value whatever. As to the commercial utility of the Branch of the Imperial Bank in SeBtan, it may be judged by results. It is obvious that the remittance and exchange class of business which the Manager is restricted to, can never induce trade. * s The Branch Bank, therefore, along with the other items of expenditure from Indian revenues intended to encourage the trade, seems only to benefit a few money-lenders and shopkeepers; and those, unfortunately, of a parasitic class which may fulfil a function of its own, but whose presence in Seistan does not assist Indian trade. 10. My proposal would therefore he that the Government of India should transfer the subsidy now paid to the Imperial Bank to a selected trading Agency. It would, of course, be necessary to secure the consent of the Bank to the arrangement made with them being terminated before the full period of the agreement has elapsed ; but judging from the Manager’s letter to the Foreign Office, dated the 19th December 1906, any proposal of the sort would be welcomed by the Board of Directors. 11. This Consulate has not been furnished with a copy of the correspon dence on the subject of the Bank’s agreement with His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, and I am consequently unable to suggest the details of this scheme, which is, practically, the substitution for a Bank without trading powers, of a trading concern which could incidentally offer banking facilities. My general idea is that the Government of India should either acquire or rent the site and buildings from the Bank. The residential part, with the land adjacent, might he set apart for the Vice-Consul, and Consulate Doctor (if one is sanctioned), on payment of rent or otherwise, as might be decided. The Bank compound, should be made over to the a proportionate amount of the rent. This There are no quarters at present available, and these officers occupy one of the Bank buildings. premises, with the remainder of the Concern on payment of Trading would be deducted from the annual subsidy of £1,500, the balance being payable to the concern in any way which might be decided. In consideration of this subsidy, the Agency should act as Treasurers for the Consulate. It might be necessary, in order to ensure the Agency fulfilling its purpose as a genuine Indian Trade Agency, instead of degenerating into a shop, to lay down some rules of business, w hich it would be the Consul’s duty to see were observed. This, however, and other details might be left for subsequent settlement, if the general idea is approved. 12. I am unable to suggest the name of any firm that would be willing, and capable of undertaking the suggested Agency. 13. In conclusion, I trust the scheme I have outlined, which has for its object the initiation of a genuine Indo-Persian trade by the Nushki route, will receive your consideration. 14.

V' Proposed Loan to assist Birjand Trade. tit ,, In , thK »&gt;ary under date 7th May, it was reported that the Shaukat „1 Moik has said he would send a caravan to India this autumn. The British Agent at Birjand recently reminded him about this. The Shaukat t. * the drains on his purse had been so heavy this year that he wis 1 to »_(■«*. The Malik.u-l'ajjar £ “ bo *.™”S Shaukat s banker, came forward with an offer that if he was aiv™ a Enpees 20,000 in India, he would send camels to Quetta and nnreWn n J?^ to this amount. The security offered was the goods themselvej L] a suftaWe personal guarantee. The manager of the Seistan Branch, who is never able to find employment for the capnal lying in his strong room, was stronglv in favour of the loan, which in his opinion not only possessed th; advanr a -e of safety, but was likely to have the most beneficial effect on the Indo-Birland trade. It is much to be regretted therefore that the Head Office followed what I must describe as their usual course of overruling Mr. McMurrav’s judgment and refusing their sanction. I have telegraphed to His Maiesrv’. Minister asking if he can unofficially recommend the loan. ^ The Water Question, The Karguzar has sent the following telegram to Meshed : — “I have returned from the Sarhad yesterday and examined the places with great care. The Afghans are digging a canal ‘like a river ’ in such a way that the Afghan land will be benefited and three important places will he waterless. I am negotiating about it Perhaps they may stop. If not, I will dig a canal on the 4th of the month, above theirs. But this requires labour. The people on account of new rules are not prepared to work for their own benefit. We get no help from either our own people or foreigners. Details by post ”. The canal “like a river” is, I believe, a out which the Afghans are making from Burj-i-As to Shela Charkh. ^ I am sending a man to see if the work will have the results the Kar^uzar says he anticipates. My present opinion is that this official is making mis chief for his own ends. ° Revenue Grain. Saturday, 21st December—1 hear that orders have been received that money is to be recovered in lieu of the revenue grain from the Miankanii district at cheaper rates, the loss to the Najd-ul-Saltaneh being made up by mereased rates for other districts where the grain commands a better sale. This is not likely to help matters. Negotiations for free export are still proceeding. Mr. Howson in Birjand. ® owson on return to Birjand was given a very good reception, all the leading people of the place riding out to meet him. As he had only been away a short time this spontaneous demonstration was very unusual and testifies to his great popularity in the place. 2) 1 it / Jif * 4 Fidatvis in Birjand. Mr. Howson has spoken to the Sbaukat on this subject. The latter said that the volunteer movement was the result of the Turkoman raids and was not anti-Faranghi. This is of course not correct, as it followed the Syeds’ telegram to Tehran about the convention. On the whole, Mr. Howson is of opinion that the movement is not of any great importance. R. L.

Sunday, 15th December .—The Minister of Revenue has telegraphed to the Bashir*ul-Wazara (Telegraphist), asking how long the prohibition of export of grain to Afghanistan had been in force and whether, if the prohibition were withdrawn, the revenue grain would find a sale. A reply has been sent that the prohibition was imposed four years ago and that there was now no market for grain and that the withdrawal of the order would have a good result. Other telegrams have been sent to a similar effect. Kargttzar’s Tour, and Water Question, The Karguzar returned yesterday evening. During the course of his tour he visited Band-i-Shahgul and Baud-i-Pariun and made himself generally acquainted with the canal system, of which also his brother made a sketch map. He met no Afghan officials. In the neighbourhood of Takht-i-Shah a complaint was made to him that the Afghans had carried off a flock of sheep. This was in the nature of reprisal for the construction of the long dyke in the neighbourhood of Tappa Tilai which was referred to in my Diary of the 24th October. One of Musa Khan’s men has come in to discuss the matter and it is not likely to develop further. I understand that the Band-i-Pariun had been constructed by joint Afghan and Seistan labour before the Karguzar’s arrival, and there is now no water dispute of any importance. In this connection, a telegram recently received by the Karguzar from the Poreign Minister may be quoted in extenso :— “ Your telegram regarding the excavation of lower part of Pariun canal (and) statement of Afghan Sarhaddar received. This stated that the people of Seistan do not join (the Afghans) in excavation; you should bind Dost Muham mad Khan and Khan Jehan Khan to send their coolies so that with Afghan coolies they may dig the canal so that when with your help the canal is dug, there will be no more necessity to dig a new canal and this matter will end. But this that the Afghan Officer has shown a map and agreement and represents that the Yamin-i-Nizam and British and Afghan Commissioners have settled that one- third of the water of the Helmund should be the property of Persia, such an agree ment has never been accepted or signed by the Yamin-i-Nizam and the Persian Government, and the water award is only that first award of General Goldsmid which explained that none of the parties should take any action the result of which might be injurious to the necessary quantity of water for the other side. Discus sions took place between the Yamin-i-Nizam and the British Commissioner and an award was made by the British Commissioner. But the Persian Government offered objections to it and it has up to present remained ineffective. I have sent (papers) to you by post so that perusing them you may know that the water question has remained in abeyance and this should be taken into con sideration. The Yamin-i-Nizam himself also had informed the Afghan officer at that time that British Commissioner’s award regarding water had not been (*ic) by the Persian Government,** Kain-Afghan Prontier.

Yfith reference to the concluding paragraph of your letter I am requested to say that my Directors will reserve further observations on the subject until a future occasion when the result of the experiment in establishing a branch at Nasratabad may become more clear; in the meanwhile they would merely remark that thus far the prospects of doing profitable business in Seistan appear so unfavourable that the question of event ually closing the branch may be forced upon the Board. It has to be bojirne in mind that the Russian Bank (which is virtually a branch of the Imperial Bank of Russia) which also is established at Nasratabad, is in a better position to continue work at a loss there than the Imperial Bank of Persia inasmuch as its operations are less subject to Banking and commercial India Office S.W.commercial conditions and control than are those I have the honour to remain.

Interesting Statement by Sir Lepel Griffin on Persian Trade and Affairs. 'ihe fifteenth ordinary general meeting of the members of the Imperial Bank of Persia was held yesterday, at Cannon-street Hotel, Sir Lepei Griffin, K.C.S.I. (chairman of the company), pre siding. The Manager and Secretary (Mr. George Newell), read the notice convening the meeting. The Chairman said: Although the report is a very brief one, I will not trouble you by reading it, as I see it is in your hands. * The point to which, of course, the only attention has to be directed is the result, which shows you a gross profit for the year of about £ 100 , 000 , which, added to the amount carried forward, makes a total of £115.394, leaving, after the whole expenses, charges, management, and everything else has been written off, a balance of £70,512. This year we propose to pay you a rather increased dividend— (hear, hear)—which I trust will be agreeable to vou, and I also trust that it will be accepted with out any hostile criticism, even bv those who are most conservative in the matter of placing a real, solid reserve at the disposal of the bank. On this I would say one word. We consider the payment this year of a larger dividend is not so much in itself a matter of great importance, as it is of shoe ing really the view which the directors, I think justly, take of the position and future of the bank. (Hear, hear.) We should not, as you can under- ■ wV.. jv( 2 ) stand, care to pay an increased dividend unleee we thought that we should have the power of doing the same in future years, and our confidence that tints may be the case is principally shown by the consideration of the events of tne past year, which ha\e been I may say, almost from first to last, unfavourable to banking business and to trade generally. This has not been, for the bank, a bad year—our balance-sheet shows that it has not, hut it has been a bad year for trade, as last year .' HS y ear lia s been complicated by the war which is unfortunately, now raging in the East, and which has influenced every part of the civilised world, and Persia more immediately, as it is in a line with Kussia on her northern border. Russia is, in ordinary times, a great purchaser of the raw produce of Persia, especially cotton, dry fruits, and wool, and this year almost all these purchases nave ceased, with the result of an almost complete stoppage of exchange operations in the northern parts of Persia with Russia, dien, in addition to the war, we have had a ve v y bad season, owing to a visit of cholera, which has affected the whole country. From Tabriz, in the noith, to Shiraz in the south great mortality has existed, and in many places for some time there has been a great loss and cessation of trade for the time being. Then another cJuse of trade de pression has been the exceedingly unfavourable weather for silk culture in Ghilan. Silk was very much injured this year, and the French export was considerably impeded thereby. These arc- reasons, I think, why, in the future', we may with confidence hope for better conditions and fo'r an increase of the prosperity which I am so happy to place before you to-day as the position of the jank during this year; for we have done so much and have showm so strong a position in an. exceed ingly unfavourable year, from the general banking point of view, that I think we may look forward to far better results when the position has become a normal one. As usual. I have put down a few notes regarding the accounts; but really there is nothing I can say of much importance in elucidating them, as they are exceedingly simple and exceedingly clear ; but, for those who are not present in the room, I suppose it is better I should( 2 ) iy an increased dividend unlet*&gt; e should have th,e power of doing :e years, and our confidence that case is principally shown by the he events of tne past year, which y say, almost from first to last, banking business and to trade ias not been, for the bank, a bad !-sheet shows that it has not, r ^ bad year for trade, as last year las been complicated by the war nately, now raging in the East, luenced every part of the civilised i more immediately, as it is in a an her northern border.

These arc- why, in the future', we may &gt;pe for better conditions and for prosperity which I am so happy in to-day as the position of the pear ; for we have done so much &gt; strong a position in an exceed- year, from the general banking d I think we may look forward ts when the position has become s usual, I have put down a few ie accounts ; but really there is say of much importance in as they are exceedingly simple ear ; but, for those who are not n, I suppose it i s better I should mention the principal points in a little more detail than they are placed before you in the balance- sheet. I would just say that I won’t mention the capital and reserve account, which, as you notice, is in creased this year by £15,000. Notes in circulation have, in round figures, risen from £346,000 to £480,000 and deposits in Persia from £207,000 to £394,000. Now, regarding the notes I wish to say a few things hereafter, because I dwelt on this subject at some length last year, and I wish to continue that subject, and show how far our position has improved. With regard to deposits, the increase is partly made up of balances standing to the credit of the Persian Government at the date the books were closed; but, making allow ance for these special credits, the increase in the ordinary deposits, notwithstanding the bank has reduced the rate of interest on accounts, is highly satisfactory. The deposits in London are about the same—a little lens. Bills payable, en dorsements, and adjustments are this year £205,000, against £148,000 last year, and comprise acceptances and drafts advised £144,000, balances due to correspondents £ 20 , 000 , letters of credit issued, adjustments, &amp;c., £41,000. The next item does not require notice; it is, of course, the final transaction of the financial year, comprising the last two items in the profit and loss account, which mean the proposed dividend of the half-year and the amount that we carry forward to next year. On the opposite side of the balance-sheet we have cash in hand, at bankers’, and in transit £597,000, against £285,000 last year, and money lent in London at call and short notice £434,000, against £373,000. These two items, tog 3 .her £1,032,000, show a very strong cash posi tion against noles, deposits, and bills payable ; but the amount, which is larger than the directors care to have under ordinary circumstances, will, we hope, gradually decrease when exchange busi ness is resumed after the recent cholera epidemic. There is no item bullion in hand this year, the bar silver held last year by the bank having been minted. Investments figure at £164,000, against £138,000 last year, and the value of the stocks has been taken on the prices ruling at March 20 last,( 4 ) which were a little lower than those current at the date of the balance-sheet, September 20. The difference is something, I think, between £ 2,000 and £3,000 ; but we thought it was well to leave it at the earlier sum—it is safer ; but I have not the least doubt, if matter’s change, as they are changing now, that next year we shall be able to raise the value of investments considerably, and make a better adjustment. All our investments, 1 may say, although 1 will not read the list or them r ^ to you, are of the highest ckuss—every one of them is a first-class investment, and they are improving continually. There is nothing speculative about them. The heading, loan to Persian Government, which last year stood at £3,489, has disap peared from the present accounts, the balance having been paid off. One word about bills dis counted, loans, and advances, and that rather for those who are not in the room than for those who are present, for whom it is rather trying to listen to a bald statement of figures which can only be followed agreeably upon paper. These bills dis counted, loans, and advances stand at £570,000, against £490,000 last year, and comprise bills discounted £125,000, loans and advances £374,000, and balances due from correspondents, adjustments, &amp;c., £71,000. The proportion of these past due accounts and bills is of a very small amount— nothing more than normal. Bills receivable £99,000, of which £2,000 are past due, and bank premises, furniture, and stationery, £30,000, are the next items. Bank premises stood last year at £ 22 , 000 , the increase this year being due chiefly to purchase of land and building of new premises at Shiraz and at Nasratabad, in Seistan. As to the profit and loss figures there is nothing with which I need trouble you ; they are all so clear that he who runs may read. The only thing which, perhaps, might cause some surprise was our fall in income-tax from £2,283 last year to £737 this year. If this represented the real state of affairs it would be a most serious thing ; for the larger income-tax we pay the better we are pleased; but this is a mere question of account with the Inland Revenue office, and which I will explain in one second, otherwise it might seem rather mysterious. From the time the bank was formed we have made provision for income-tax on the net profits of the( 5 ) ittle lower than those current at balance-sheet, September 20. The nothing, I think, between £ 2,000 we tbought it wae well to leave sum—it is safer; but I have not if matters change, as they are iat next year we shall he able to of investments considerably, and ljustment.

One word about bills dis- nd advances, and that rather for it in the room than for those who .vhom it its rather trying to listen ent of figures which can only be iy upon paper.

Bills receivable i £ 2,000 are past due, and bank e, and stationery, £30,000, are the ik premises stood last year at ease this year being due chiefly nd and building of new premises Nasratabad, in Seistan. As to the ures there is nothing with which u ; they are all so clear that he read. The only thing which, 3 use some surprise was our fall m £2,283 last year to £737 this resented the real state of affairs ist serious thing; for the larger i the better we are pleased ; but ■ stion of account with the Inland nd which I will explain in one it might seem rather mysterious, bank was formed we have made me-tax on the net profits of the year. We have paid income-tax on the estimate of the three years previous net profits. On this there was a credit balance left in our favour of about £700. To this we may add the amount—I think, of about £800—which was due to an over charge from the Revenue Department of the Government. That left us some £1,500, to wdiich we add the amount due to the income-tax of the year, leaving the normal amount about £ 2 , 200 ; but this year, that, of course, being deducted— £1,500 being deducted from that—leaves this small amount, which I am afraid we shall not have again figuring in our accounts. It seems a rather con fused operation ; but in reality it is simplicity itself, and is merely due to an amount owing to us from the Revenue Department. Well, that is all I wish to say about the ac counts. I now wish to make a few remarks con cerning several matters on which I have spoken to you before, and which, I trust, if things go well, I may have to speak to you about again, because they are all of prominent interest. First, I would say a few words regarding the notes, which is our great stand-by in Persia-—the one concession by which we hope to rise superior to all future competition. I explained to you last year that we had suffered enormously from attempts of various private companies in Persia—principally in Shiraz, Resht, and other places—to issue promis sory notes, payable to bearer, very much like our banlc notes ; indeed, so much like that we saw no difference between them. We have a concession— the sole concession—for the issue of hank notes, which, of course, are promissory notes issued by the banking corporation, payable to bearer on de mand, and this right we determined to guard to the utmost. We have guarded it and defended it with success. Partly owing to the goodwill of the Persian Government, partly owing to the great energy and assistance of our British Minister in Teheran (Sir Arthur Hardinge), but chiefly owing to the automatic action of the bank itself, which has so strengthened its position and its popularity with the masses of the Persian people, our notes have by their owm weight borne down op position, and now, I think I may say, are supreme, without any rival in Persia at all. (Applause.)( 6 ) J I' e not ' ;j ^ ■ 'J uur ri val—generally a \iery Inemlly rival in Teheran, the Russian Banque d hiSconipte, of which 1 do not wish to say anything disagreeable in any way, have ceased. Those issued by the Shiraz and other merchants in the south have, at any rate, disappeared for the time and even should these attempts revive, as revive they may, I think our financial 'position, so far as note-issue is concerned, is so strong that we need fear no eonupetiition of anv force against us. In addition to what 'is put down in this paper before you, our notes lave risen, even since the conclusion of this statement, as slowly, steadily, and surely as at any time, and to-day, were we to reduce our notes to cash at the current exchange of the .’'ay which is very high, I am sorry to say—w e should have a circulation of considerably over £500,000 sterling in notes in Persia, That is all I wish to say on tnat point; but it is a very important point—in deed we have rather to check than to increase quickly our note circulation, for reasons which are obvious and familiar to you all; but we can only look -upon this as a sure sign of the future pro sperity of the bank. Without this great popularity of our notes we could never feel our position was absolutely secure. I must say a word about the new branches we opened last year. The one at Kerman which is a very favourable trade centre— is coing veiy well. It is too soon to say very much but the people are taking very kindly there to our notes. The branch is in the hands of a clever and energetic young man, and 1 have no doubt it will P a y ■ As to Nasratabad, I have not much to say about that It is in anew country altogether with little local trade, and was established very much at the request of the Indian Government, who wished to develop the Jdushki route, and it will require some time before either the transit and through trade or the local trade witi pay. How ever. we are not losing there. That is all I can 'V to that branch. We do not tend to lose by it. It is not at present a profit able experiment; but in two or three years time may be a very useful and influential place. There a trade centre near it, a little further north.r 0 bl) ( 6 ) ed by our rival—generally a wry n Teheran, the Russian Banque vhich 1 do not wish to say anything any way, have ceased.

That is all T wdsh to say on it is a very important point^—in- ither to check than to increase circulation, for reasons which are iliar to you all; but we can only as a sure sign of the future pro- nk. Without this great popularity could never feel our position was I must say a word about the e opened last year. The one at is a very favourable trade centre— I- It is too soon to say very much, ie taking very kindly there to our ich is in the hands of a clever and man, and 1 have no doubt it will &gt; Nasratabad, I have not much to It is in a new country altogether trade, and was established very est of the Indian Government, who ip the JJushki route, and it will ue before either the transit and the local trade will pay. How-- losing there. That is all I can ;aid to that branch. We do not it. It is not at present a profit- but in two or three years time iseful and influential place'. There i near it, a little further nortb ( ( 7 ) called Birjand, which is, from several points of view, more valuable for trade purposes. To that point we have also directed our attention. Bunder Abbas Port, wdiich has attracted great interest, both commercially and politically, in the last few years—if you can call it a port, as it is nothing but a sandbank—-is the great port of the eastern side of the Persian Gulf, and there we are considering the question of an agency, should it be desired in in fluential quarters; but we are not very anxious about it ourselves. However, should we establish it, it will not be to the loss of the bank ; but it is a place which is said, by tradition, to be only separated from hell by a sheet of brown paper, and no European can comfortably live there for some months in the year. Fortunately, there are some hills in the neighbourhood, where it may be possible to get a sanatorium ; but I should not invite any of our young friends in the bank to take up their abode there if any other choice were left to them. Here I would say a word with regard to our staff. Mr. Rabino, as you know, is a man of great ability, who has guided the affairs of the bank in Persia with singular skill and discretion during the parst year, which has been by no means an easy year, and he has been ably supported by his staff there. One of our most competent managers (Mr. \ an Lennop), I am grieved to say, has died of cholera, which seems to visit Persia every eight or ten years. Though the Europeans have gene rally escaped, yet there have been some cases of death among them. I would specially note a‘ para graph from the manager’s report, in justice to our staff in Persia. He says: “We cannot allow this report to end without rendering testimony to the exemplary conduct of our staff during the' time of trouble and anxiety we have passed through.” liie fact is, they behaved in a very gallant manner, as all young Englishmen, I think, do. Our doors were never shut during the worst time of the epidemic, either in the head office or in tli« bazaar, and a good deal of popularity was won by them by their courteous distribution of medi- cine, which certainly did a great deal of good amongst the poorer inhabitants of Teheran. This is all 1 wish specially to say about the bank ; hut I I( 8 ) would say a word or two eoncerning Persia, which may be of interest beyond this room, though 1 am .not going to speak of political matters, which do not concern our bank. 1 would first mention th-e financial reform which has been initiated by the present Sadr Azim, the present Prime Minister, Prince Ayn-ud-Dowlah, a near relation of the Shah. You understand that no State can be prosperous unless its financeg are regularised-, and no finances can be regularised without a Budget and regular payments of revenue, which have now r I am very ha.ppy to say, been arranged for Persia. Supposing that the financial reforms which are now r started are carried out—and I think they have been started in all sincerity—we may con gratulate His Imperial Majesty, the Prime Minister, and the Financial Minister (M. Naus). A Budget has been prepared, and all revenue payments are made into a central Treasury account, and, al though these cannot be popular with those officials who °have been accustomed &lt;to illegal exactions all over the country, supported 'by irregular pay ments to His Majesty on their appointment and on holidays, yet it is a very great step towards the financial equilibrium of Persia, and as such we must rejoice at it having been taken. Another point I wish especially to mention. As a bank—as the chief English institution in the whole of the Persian Empire, and, conse quently, as representing English commerce and trade in that great country—we take a very keen and a very deep interest in everything which con cerns British trade, not only for general and national and patriotic reasons, but because, it directly affects the fortunes of our bank. This morning I read over my last year’s speech to you, and I find I mentioned the umcertainty of the future as to trade, and that the new tariff has caused a great uncertainty in the minds of traders. I paid : “As the new arrangements for the Customs collection, which are infinitely superior to those formerly enforced, become more and more effective, and as the new tariff adapts itself to the requirements of the country, we shall see, no doubt, a large developmemt of trade in Persia, and especially in Southern Persia, in which, no doubt, this bank and British commerce will obtain the( 8 ) or two concerning Persia, which s&gt;t beyond this room, though 1 ipeak of political matters, which ir hank. I would first mention •m which has been initiated by kzim, the present Prime Minister, iwlah, a near relation of the srstand that no State can be its finances are regularised-, and ie regularised without a Budget Hits of revenue, which have now r 0 say, beau arranged for Persia, le financial reforms which are carried out—and I think they 1 in all sincerity—we may con- erial Majesty, the Prime Minister, Minister (M. Naus). A Budget 1 , and all revenue payments are tral Treasury account, and, al- ot be popular with those officials accustomed to illegal exactions try, supported by irregular pay- jesty on their appointment and it is a very great step towards ilibrium of Persia, and as such t it having been taken. I wish especially to mention, he chief English institution in 3 Persian Empire, and, conse- senting English commerce and it country—we take a very keen interest in everything which con- ade, not only for general and riotic reasons, but because it he foirtunes of our bank. This ver my last year’s speech to you, ntioned the umoertainty of the le, and that the new tariff has icertainty in the minds of traders, lew arrangements for the Customs are infinitely superior to those sd, become more and more the new tariff adapts itself to the the country, we shall see, no velopmemt of trade in Persia, and diern Persia, in which, no doubt, ritish commerce will obtain the ( 9 ) largest share.” With regard to that I wish to refer to the figures which I recently received, and which appear, both to me and my colleagues, to be very striking. The last trade returns we had from Persia—they naturally are not very recent— deal with the six mouths from March to Sep tember of 1903, and, comparing them with the six months of the year before, there dees, not seem to me—nor has there ever seemed to me from other returns—any signs, as we see in so many newspapers which are fond of taking a pessi mistic view of everything English, of dimi nution in the English trade with Persia, or that English interests—I am specially speaking of commercial interests—are being in any way in jured or ousted from tbe country. I think this should be thoroughly understood by Englishmen and Eniailish merchants who wish to deal with Persia, and who may deal with Persia far more largely, to great advantage. You will remember how disaster was prophesied for our tea trade, for example, when, at Russian instigation, a large increase was made to the Customs duty on tea two years ago. I look at these last returns, and I see that while in 1902 we imported into Persia altogether 2.000,000 lb. of tea, yet last year, in the corresponding months, it had risen at least 20 per cent.—nearly 25 per cent. It had risen to 2.592.000 lb. You see, instead of the natural causes having resulted, an opposite effect occurred. This may be explained by reasons which are too ohseure to go into at tills meeting ; but there the fact remains. In 1902 cotton yarn from Great Britain was valued at £46,000 ; last year it had risen 15 per cent, to 20 per cent. Cotton textiles of all kinds, cotton and manufac tured goods of all kinds, rose from 9,250,000 lb. to nearly 12 , 000,000 lb. in the same time : and so 1 might go on with the various things which are noted in this list, and the information contained in it we are very willing to give to anybody who likes to have it. But all that I can say is that, looking at these returns, it seems to me that British trade in Persia—and remember that these figures are for the time preceding the war —is increasing in a larger degree than we could have expected, and, indeed, in a very great( 10 'Qjree, and there is every hope for the future, con- derins tlie many things with winch we are jquainted, such as the large cotton crop m inerica this year and the war, which has pre- 3 nted Russian trading operations in the north. , seems to me that we may have a very profitable mimereial time with Persia during the next two jars and in the future. {“ Hear hear, and ap- lause.) I wanted to make these remarks because wish it to be understood that we who do now Persia intimately-peril ape even better than le Foreign Office, except in their own diplomatic ork, because we have agents in every part of tne cuntry north and south—look upon British trade ith Persia as being in no degree decaying and jeble, as is represented in so many English papers, ut as in a very firm, healthy, and prosperous con- itio-n. (Applause.) I confess I am speaking more ir myself than my colleagues in making Hiese ^; larks ; but the conversations 1 have had vutn hem show that that is their opinion also.

You may understand roike the higher deities unneces- ( 11 ) sarily, and desire to do our work without the interposition of the British Government whenever it can be so done, remembering that we are the State bank of Hie Majesty the Shall and his Government in Persia; but—and no one can forget it, in these days of competition through out the world—also remembering that we are still a great English institution—the greatest in Persia. And in every foreign country, in these days, the Englishman and English in stitutions must finally rest upon the bedrock of the immediate support and warm sympathy and assistance of the British Government. ihis. l think, in commercial undertakings, hoe been more realised by the Foreign Office in late years than it used to be in the old days, when English com merce was perhaps treated as a thing hardly deserving the high consideration of the exalted luminaries who rule the diplomatic heavens. But in Lord Lansdowne, who has done for has country, in the United States, in Japan, in France, and elsewhere, as great, and greater, service as any Foreign Minister in the last fifty years, in any humble opinion we have at last found a man who realises that the soul of English diplomacy is in English trade, and I think he is disposed in nil parts of the world to maintain and uphold the exertions—the honest, straightforward, and imm- trh uing exertions—of great institutions like that which, for the moment, d have the honour in adequately to represent. I now formaHy move: “ That the report presented he adopted, that the accounts to September 20, 1904, as rendered, be accepted, and that a final dividend of 5s. per share, free of income-tax, be, and is hereby, declared. Sir Thomas Jackson seconded the resolution. A Shareholder said the chairman had not made any reference to the establishment of several new English Consulates in Persia. He did not profess to have much knowledge on the subject, but he would like to know what the board thought upon these Consulates. Mr. Holmes thanked the chairman, on behalf of the shareholders, for the extremely interesting address which he had delivered, and remarked thai so long as Sir Lepel Griffin was at the helmC 12 ) of their affairs, they might consider that the bans, would ever steer a straight ccuiee. The Chairman said the matter referred, to by the shareholder was a very delicate one to discuss at a public meeting. He would only say that •every thing which tended to increase the legitimate in fluence of England in Persia was an excellent thing, and he thought the more Consuls they had in that country the'better. He knew that the men who had been*selected had been chosen with great discretion. The resolution was then agreed to. The retiring directors (Mr. H. Coke and General Sir T- E. Gordon) were re-elected. The reappointment of the auditors was propose by Mr. Holmes and seconded by a shareholder, and unanimously carried. On the motion of Mr. Bryce, seconded by Mr. Holmes, a cordial vote of thanks was accorded the chairman, directors, and staff.
