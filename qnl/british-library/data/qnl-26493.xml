We sent you hy the air mail of 1st September a copy of the private letter which we wrote to the Foreign Office on its receipt, ana I now enclose a copy of their reply. 2. The Foreign Office letter, I think, speaks for itself. We had not, however, hitherto realised that Bushire and Koweit received copies direct from Jedua. If this is the case there seems no urgency about sending them on copies from the Government of India. We will, therefore, continue to send the same number as at present to you, and we hope that tne availability, for practical purposes, of two extra copies may go some way to meet the Government of India's difficulties I need not say that we entirely agree with the arrangements proposed in paragraph 3 of your letter of 2nd August as regards the circulation of extracts.

LAITHWAITE. 10(i3INDEXED 'OREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. I H'?. 6th October, 1932 (E 4327/1197/25) My dear Gilbert, x M ft I have delayed answering your letter No. P.Z.5093/32 of the 24th August about the distribution of the Jedda reports, as we wanted to discuss with Ryan, not only the question of the distribution of the reports, but that of their general nature. We have for some time boon inclined to doubt whether they were worth the labour expended on them and whether their great length, apart from being the chief cause of the delay in the distribution of the printed copies, did not in fact detract from their value. The result of our discussions with Ryan is that he proposes, as from the beginning of 1933, (or perhaps earlier), to give the Jedda reports the form of a news letter, somewhat on the lines of the monthly reports sent by the Agent and Consul at Jedda before the Legation was established, and to reduce them to about a J.G. Laithwaite, Esqa third of their present length. Unfortunately it is impossible for Jedda to supply more typed copies of their reports than they do at present''indeed Ryan says that in the hijefeht of the hot weather it is very difficult to make their reduplicating machine produce legible copies at all — and they cannot therefore give effect to the proposal in the final paragraph of your letter. But, as the length of the reports is to be so much reduced, their composition and printing will, we hope, be rendered correspondingly easier and quicker and much of the delay in distributing the printed copies should be avoided. We hope that in this way the requirements of the Government of India will be largely met and that the reports in their new form may have an increased value for all concerned. I notice by the way that in the first paragraph of his letter of 2nd August Metcalfe says that the Government of India have been in the habit of sending copies of the reports to Bushire, Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat. But the direct distribution from Jedda includes Bushire and ' Koweit, who should, therefore, get them reasonably quickly already. As Bahrein and Muscat are presumably less importantimportant recipients of these reports;thi^ fact seems to go a good way to meet India’s main point and in addition will give them two more copies to use for other purposes.

I'i 0 ** {4 My dear Walton, /f Reference your personal and confidential letter No.P.Z.3704/32, dated the 30th June 1932, re-r gardlng extra copies of the Jeddah Reports. I have now gone carefully into the question and find that the dis tribution which we have been in the habit of making is as follows One copy each to Bushire, Bahrein.Kqweit and Muscat leaving one printed copy for ourselves and one typed copy received from Jeddah which is being used for the information of the General Staff Branch and the Department of Education,Health and Lands. The request for 10 copies from Jeddah arose partly in order that we might give both General Staff Branch and Department of Education, Health and Lands separate copies for perusal at leisure and partly because the Foreign Office prints received through you frequently do not arrive until several months after the period to which they refer. So far as the first consideration ' is concerned, we can quite well manage on the existing number of copies, namely, 6 (5 prints and one received direct from Jeddah) and will send relevant extracts to the Departments interested, such extracts being, if neces sary, copied in this Department. The second difficulty £ asas regards delay will hov/ever remain unless it is possible for us to obtain the prints through you with rather more despatch. Vve quite appreciate the necessity for secrecy with regard to these reports and I have taken steps to see that the principle is carefully observed in this Department.

To Foreign Office, et-s-'draf ted. \j*r' ■ 617 5000 1.32 I enclose for your personal information copies of d.o.correspond ence which we have had with the Foreign Office about the supply to the Government of India of extra copies of the Jeddah Reports. As you know the Foreign Office are exceedingly sensitive as to the distribution given to any of the secret or confidential reports from their Legations abroad, and we are anxious to do what we can to reassure them. 2. Under arrangements made with the Foreign Office in 1926, (see Wakely T s letter to the Foreign Secretary No. P.1179/26 of 29th April 1926), five copies of these reports are sent to the Government of India through this Office, of which one is for the Foreign and Political Department, and four for Bushire, Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat respectively. One copy is in addition apparently sent direct by the Jeddah Legation to the Goverment of India and to the Resident at Aden. We are not clear whether the requestrequest for the extra copies from Jedda took account of the fact that the Gulf Agencies were already provided for hy copies sent from home, but we should be grateful if you would let us have a copy of the present distribution list, and of the departments for which further copies are required. No doubt the explanation is.that the General Staff are interested in certain aspects of the Jeddah deports and that sections dealing with the Pilgrimage and with quarantine matters are of interest to other Departments of the Government of India. We are, however, inclined to suggest that you may think that the simplest method of dealing with the problem might be as suggested by the Foreign Office, to make suitable extracts for interested Departments, and leave the number of copies supplied to the Government of India at its present figure. 3. I thought it better to send you the Foreign Office letter, as it stands. We have had, as you know, considerable trouble in the past owing to their extreme aislikbDraft Paper Department of any wide distribution of their confidential papers, and, as you will appreciate, we are very anxious to ao anything we can to meet them in the interests of maintaining the supply of the very full and valuable information which we at present receive.

LAITHWAIT^IINDEXED / (E 2966/1197/25) j FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 23rd June, 1932, V / noi Dear Laithwaite, I enclose copies of correspondence between the Jedda Chancery and the Foreign and Political Department about Jedda reports, which we have received from Hope Gill. Apart from the mechanical difficulty to which the Jedda Chancery refer, we are a little doubtful whether it is altogether desirable for these Jedda reports to receive as wide distribution as the Government of India have in mind. They often contain confidential, sometimes highly confidential matter, and have always been written pretty frankly on the understanding that they are only seen by persons of real discretion. We do not know to whom the Government of India would propose to distribute them. Could you perhaps find out semi-officially from India and thereafter let us know your views? I should personally rather doubt there being ten posts /in J.G. Laithwaite, Esq..—I.. I - - I I — n—w.uj j BOBin India which would really benefit by seeing the whole of these reports, and wonder whether it would not be quite sufficient for the Government of India to send extracts at their discretion. Possibly it would be worth while a copy going regularly to Bombay, in which case Jedda could probably squeeze out one more copy and send it direct. If, after consideration, it is really considered desirable for the Government of India to have the ten extra copies we can only suggest that they should receive copies from here through you; but these, of course would be somewhat belated. I am asked, however, to stress the point that it is very desirable that the confidential character of these reports should be most strictly preserved. Yours ever,0 rp p. z. Copy.

Dear Chancery, We notice that the copy of the Jedda Report for the period November - December 1931 which you so kindly sent to us was reproduced on a duplicating machine. The Government of India require 10 copies of the Report for distribution and we should esteem it a great favour if you could in future let us have 10 copies of your Reports, if they are available. Yours ever Foreign and Political Department. His Majesty’s Legation JEDDA.v COPY No. 1436/494/8 May 20th, 1932. Dear Department, Your note of the 22nd April about extra copies of the Jedda Report:- We are sorry to say that, in this climate, our cyclostyle stencils will only just reproduce the 25 copies of the report which we now distribute. It would double the work if we had to make ten more copies from fresh stencils, and would considerably increase it with not very legible results, if we attempted to paint and patch the original stencils with 'obliterine”, in order to make them go further. However, we are taking up the matter with the Foreign Office and will let you know if anything else can be done to meet your wishes. Yours ever, CHANCERY.
