Mansoor had last year taken refuge in His Majesty's Vice-Consur- late Bandar Abbas from which place he absconded before orders for his despatch to Shargah reached His Majesty's Consul. He is indebted as a pearler and is required at Shargah for the settlement of his account. He should be sent forthwith to the Residency Agent to receive his manumission certificate (sent to Shargah some time ago) which will be delivered when his account is settled. In dealing with cases of negroes from the Trucial Coast, who take refuge at the Agency, and claim to be slaves, you should be guid ed by the instructions for the liberation of slaves which were for- warded to you with this office No.1107 dated 6th April 1913- From Para (iii) of the G -eneral Notes, Part IV, you will see such cases have to \ be disposed of by a Salifah Court when possible. All cases, however, must be referred to-this Residency. The pearling industry is based on a system of divers working for certain Nakhudas who grant them advances during the 'off' season, and at the beginning of the diving season (for their families left behind), which are worked off as far as possible during the season. Very oiten these advances get very large , the divers as a class being a spendthrift lot. I do not say of course that there are no abuses and that Nakhudas do not occasionally write down too much, but large sums are undoubtedly given in cash to good divers. At Bahrain we had nfigro divers in the Agency working off debts of over Rs.1000/- on several occassions. The whole fabric of the pearling industry will % collapse if any diver when he gets badly into debt can run away and escape his liabilities by the simple process of saying he is a slave. It is thus obviously^ advisable to do anything to encourage the break ing of the pearling usage or to give colour to the idea that we are ready to assist runaway divers to evade their debts . The difficulty about the business is the absence of proper accounts. Successive Political Agents in Bahrain have endeavoured to getget the Shaikh to enforce a regular U J'orm '--eni o±' accounts 'Bet ween Nakhudas and their divers and haulers, but so far without suc cess . Many Nakhudas do keep proper accounts and treat, t^eir divers very well, 'but others who are illiterate keep notes and hieroglyphics which are incomprehensible to anybody but themselves. If proper lini- 0 form accounts have not yet bean introduced in Bahrain, much less have they been on the True ial Coast a much more backward part. The Residency Agent is thus in. a ditticult position, but in most cases ihe can ascertain whether a negro is a diver or not. In the former case if the nakhuda swears before the Shaikh that the man is in debt, it is almost impossible to disprove it -..and, en passant, I may re mark that a diver who is not in debt is a rara avis, I came across very few during the 18 months I was in Bahrain during which I dealt with hundred of pearling cases . I may add that in several cases lately Khan Bahadur Abdul ' Latif has recommended the grant of Manumission certi^icate/j, and only the other day drew attention to the fact that a man who had taken refuge at Bandar Abbas ought to be manumi oteo. (X ...aci suggested a (reconciliation between him and his master as he was a family man; on the ground that the master had no right to sel^ him. iaking all . things into consideration, therefore, I think that the Khan Bahadur, though of course he makes mistakes and is not a paragon, does his best in difficult circumstances , with a considerable amount 01 suc^- cess . In conclusion I would invite your attention to the Customary,/ for Pearling cases' a copy ot which was seni- to you witn t-^is office endorsement dated 22nd February 1914.Coixy of letter No. 210^ dated 10tlx rcli i/2'Jo^ from tlx Ac tin-'; IIU% Commissioner, Tlie Residency, Zar.zi, - to the Political A^ent 5c H.

The Political Resident sent instructions to the Residency Agent at Sharjah (‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif) about how to treat pearl divers seeking refuge, who may be indentured to their boat captains, but are not technically slaves (folio 13);Memorandums sent by the Political Resident in 1926 (Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Prideaux) to the Persian Gulf Political Agents, request that any manumission cases forwarded to him in future contain information on the slave’s ethnic origins, native tongue, and any evidence of harsh treatment or branding (folios 31, 32). This information was required to assess the validity of a slave’s claims, for example if they claimed to have been ill-treated, or were recent importations into the region;Correspondence relating to a dhow, intercepted by British vessels off the Arab coast in 1928, found to be carrying four slaves (folios 43-48);Correspondence concerning the escape of five slaves from the shaikh of Bakha to Henjam [Jazīreh-ye Hengām], 1934, and the shaikh’s pursuit of the escaped slaves with fifteen men, some of them armed (folios 55-66);An enquiry in 1934 from Dr Samuel Zwemer of New York, sent to the British authorities in the Gulf, requesting copies of papers for a man who was formerly a slave from Africa, but was manumitted in Muscat in 1896. The former slave, who now resided in New York, has lost his manumission papers, but desired to return to East Africa (folios 68-71).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000af#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
