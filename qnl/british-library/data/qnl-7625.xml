Gibbon, Royal Irish Fusiliers, Staff Captain in the Division of the Chief of the Staff, as the result of the experience of a five months’ journey in Persia. It is hoped that some of the hints may prove of assist ance to officers engaged in trans-frontier inteUigence work. Simla ; 1 W. MALLESON, Lieut.-Col., V Asst, Quarter Master General The 21 s£ September 1908 . ) f or Intelligence,SURVEY WORK IN PERSIA. Attitude of Persians towards Map Making. There is a growing tendency amongst the Persians to entertain suspicions concerning any map making operations by foreigners. This is more particularly the case in the neighbourhood of the larger towns, where, on the arrival of a European traveller, the question is frequently asked as to whether he is a naqsheh hash, that is, a surveyor. At the present moment any mapping work is looked on with much suspicion, as it is liable to be considered to be all part of a plan of the English to seize the country, to which the publication of the Anglo-Russian Convention formed the first preliminary. When the actual map ping • is carried out by the European of a party more importance is liable to be attached than is the case when the work is done by a native surveyor. When astronomical observations W’ere taken it was generally arranged, when in the neighbourhood of any large town, that the observations should be carried out in the early hours of the morning at a time when no Persians were about. When out in the country away from the towns, it was found that the villagers only considered the theodolite to be some form of telescope, and no very great attention was paid to it. Obtaining of all necessary information before proceeding to Persia. Before any officer starts for Persia he should obtain all possible information from the Intelligence Branch concerning existing maps and surveys of the country through which he intends to travel. The Intelligence Branch should in turn be able to obtain all required from the Survey Department. This is more particularly of importance in the case of an officer who desires to do useful w r ork as regards astronomical observations and triangulation. In any case, it is very much more satisfactory and useful for any officer to have a definite idea of what work will produce the greatest value as a result of his labours. It is very discouraging for any one wdio has done what he has thought his best, to find on his return that his efforts were quite superfluous, the work having been already carried out in a more, or an equally, efficient form by some predecessor. Some plan that would ensure the traveller the fullest information as to what work would be most useful, and would at the same time prove of great benefit to the Intelligence Branch and the Survey Department in securing a settled and progressive basis for survey work in Persia. A suggestion made by me that the Survey Department might furnish the In telligence Branch with information concerning each of the \' = 4 miles sheets, and that'the latter should keep it up to date and be responsible for the distribution to all officers offering, or ordered, to do reconnaissance work is now being put into effect. Useful data is being compiled as follows for each r' = 4 miles sheet:— 1. The graticules required to make a projection of the map at the ordinary reconnaissance scale of U == 4 miles. This will save reference to tho Auxiliary Tables which are somewhat bulky when travelling light. 2. A list of fixed points. This list should show the reliability of each of the positions given, and whether derived from Astronomical observations or Triangulation. 62 I. B.2 3. A list of the most useful distances and Azimuths between the principal fixed points on the sheet. This is considered of great importance if an existing triangulation is to be extended, as is the case in the greater part of Persia. 4. Suggested useful theodolite work. 5. Suggested useful plane-table work. The information concerning the l' = 4 miles maps is being bound up in pamphlets so as to correspond to the sheets, and each pamphlet will have a preface containing suggestions as to surveying in general in the whole area included. As the whole of this data must in every case be worked out by the Survey Department in the course of the compilation of the maps of Persia at present under revision it is not considered that this suggestion will involve the expenditure of a great amount of extra labour or expense on the part of either that Department or the Intelligence Branch. Spelling of Names of Places. In Persia it is extremely difficult to ascertain the correct spelling of the names of the smaller viHages. The only reliable method is, by some means or other, to obtain the official spellings from the Mustaufi of the district or other official concerned with the collection of taxes, etc. Even for a native of India it is difficult to ascertain the correct spelling from the sound as pronounced by some villager. This would not, however, be of such great importance if the same name were to be always and invariably pronounced in a similar manner. This however, is not the case, as the various classes of men will each have their own pronunciation. It is, therefore, preferable to obtain the correct spelling of the name which is unchangeable, and which will admit of some uniform system of transliteration being adopted, and not a system based on a phonetic basis which is liable to vary according to the individual. At the same time it was found to be of the utmost value to obtain a phonetic rendering of the sound as well as the correct written form. K. B. Sher Jang was of opinion that when he only used English characters on his map the Persians did not evince the same degree of curiosity and suspicion as when the names were written in the Persian character. This is a point that nnght be worth remembering for future occasions. Khalassis. As the result of experience gamed in the country, it is strongly recommended that any officer going to Persia to do survey work, on however'small a scale, should, if possible, take his khalassis with him from India. Probably Pathans W “T ^ / ound most serviceable and best fitted to withstand the fatigues wbch must inevitably be encountered. Possibly men from the Attock districts who have some experience of camels as also of hills, might be found the most useful. All khalassis should have some knowledge of the use of fire-arms and should be armed with Martini-Henry carbines for preference. These armed khalassis would obviate the necessity of obtaining Persian guards on all occasions who are worse than useless at the best of times, and who merely act as inconvenient Witnesses and spies on the mapping operations. It s usually impossible to obtain Persians to act as khalassis, and if a guide can be obtained one may often consi-3 der oneself lucky. Moreover, it was found that, through want of practice, the great proportion of Persians are physically incapable of carrying a fairly heavy load to the top of a steep and high hill. On many occasions the theodolite had to be carried to the top of hills by the writer and his surveyor, the Persians hired as coolies failing by the way. As regards clothing, the men should be given thin clothing for the coastal plains and should be furnished with warm clothing and foshtins for the winter months. Good blankets or rezais are also necessary ; the former are expensive and not always obtainable in Persia, the latter can usually be made up. tem peratures of 20° of frost are common. In the latter part of the winter ram is to be expected. Theodolite. The theodolite taken was a 6-inch Vernier transit theodolite by Troughton and Sims, reading to 10'. The instrument was contained in two wooden boxes. The greatest difficulty was found in arranging for the transport of the theo dolite and stand, more especially the latter. It was quite out of the question to have the instrument carried on such a long journey, and with such long marches, on the backs of coolies—as I believe is generally done in the Survey Department, It must be realised that the stand cannot be sewn up in sacking and padded with straw as is done in the case of its being sent for a railway journey in India. Camel and mule transport are the descriptions of transport that must be legislated for in Persia, and there is no alternative, except in the case of a regular survey party, travelling with the sanction of the Persian Government, which might bring a sufficient number of its own Tchalassis from India. The difficulty of securing the theodolite stand on the back of a camel or of a mule in such a way that it shall not be injured, can scarcely be realised until experienced. Although making the weight to be carried heavier, it would probably be advisable tohaVe the stand placed in a° strong case fitted with stout hinges and a lock, aud with a couple of rings, through which the loading ropes would be passe*d, making the whole secure when fastened on the top of a camel or a mule load. Of course, at the same time, this case should be kept as light as possible consistent with the rough usage which it will have to undergo. Whilst protecting the stand from injury, the enclosing case would have the advantage of protecting the head from dust and sand, and from the gaze of the Persian, who is the most inquisitive being on the face of the earth, and is in general suspicious of any object the use of which is not im mediately evident to him. Any plan which contemplates the carrying of the boxes containing the theo dolite in one or more yakdans is bound to result in endless difficulties—except in the case of the theodolite being carried for show and not for use, a supposition which can be put on one side. On the march in Persia the traveller naturally keeps his kit down to the lowest possible limit, and, consequently, the yakdan containing the theodolite cannot be consecrated to that instrument alone. It must contain a multitude of other things in addition, but, as the theodolite is probably the heaviest article, it gravitates to the bottom. Now on a journey in Per sia, when travelling with camels, it is only with the greatest difficulty that the camelmen are induced to loose the ropes of any box to admit of its being opened even on arrival in camp in the evening, and any traveller who persists in having several loads opened every evening will undoubtedly have trouble with his camelmen. As this is the case at the regular halting places, it is not to be sup posed that they will halt in the course of a long march to have the animals un-4 loaded, the boxes opened, and the cemels detained whilst work is being done. The result of such a course would be that, even if the camelmen consented, the camels would never arrive at the end of the day’s march. With regard to the two boxes in 'which the instrument Was packed. They were of different weights, and this was found to be a great drawback when load ing the instrument on the back of any baggage animal. It was very often expe dient, when undertaking an expedition to the top of a hill some distance from camp, to load the instrument on the back of a donkey ab far as the foot of the hill. Many of these expeditions were undertaken, and will have to be undertaken, by future travellers to Persia, in parts of the country where there is not a human habitation within two or three days’long marches. Cooly transport is therefore out of the question, and reccurse must be had to the donkey. In Persia the method adopted was of carrying the instrument boxes in khurjins, or cloth saddle bags, slung over the back of the animal, whether camel, mule, or donkey. This system had the primary disadvantage of keeping the instrument always covered with a coating of dust and grit. Persia is a country of dust and sand, always present, and always constituting a more or less acute evil. This penetrates the cloth saddle bags on the march, and once there it would require a very wonderfully constructed box to keep it from working in and getting at the instrument. It was generally found possible, in the case of the comparatively rigid pack saddles of the camels and mules, to balance the boxes in the saddle bags and to fasten them in such a position that they should not shift and fall. However, with the donkey it is a different matter. The ordinary donkey saddle in use in Persia is nothing more than a quilted padding on the animal’s back, which covers him up almost like a rug : this is not fastened by a girth, and it would be useless to attempt to do so, as there is no pretence of a tree to the saddle, or 'palan as it is known. The maddening difficulty of trying to keep two boxes of very unequal weight, surmounted by an unwieldy theodolite stand on the back of a small donkey travelling, probably at night, over a country in which even the caravan roads in the neighbourhood of the mountains, would be termed mere goat tracks in any other country, has only to be experienced once, never to be forgotten again. The donkey slips and stumbles continually over rocks and boulders, on steep ascents and descents, and halts have to be made every few hundred yards to renew the never-ending task of straightening the load, and opening and re-tying knots on the loading ropes. On arrival at the foot of the hill one’s difficulties are by no means at an end: the instrument must be conveyed to the summit* The stand never presented any great difficulty, it certainly was heavy and awkward, but, at a pinch, it could be carried for a short distance by one hand. The case of the instrument boxes was very different. These latter were unprovided with any handle, or even rings, in which to fasten ropes to sling them. This defect was all the more marked, as it is not the custom of the Persian to carry a load on his head, even when it is possible to find a man available, capable, and willing to carry anything at all. In a great number of cases it was found that when men were obtained to carry the instrument boxes to the top of the hills, they were physically incapable of doing so, not being accustomed to climbing hills, and never to climbing them with a load. The result is that the traveller and his surveyors find, if any work is to be done at all, they must be prepared to carry the instruments to the top of the hills themselves, unless they have brought trained khalassis from India for the purpose. Considering the difficult nature of some of the hills, their steepness, and the difficulty of keeping a footing on the hard black ironstone—of which a large number of the hills are formed in South- East Persia—it is essential that at least one hand should be free to help the climber. For these reasons it is important that the instrument boxes5 should be fitted with slings of some description. By far the most prefer able would be some form of sling that would admit of the boxes being slung individually on men’s backs between the shoulders, and that would also permit of their being connected together so as to enable them to be slung across the back of a pack animal. The makeshift of slinging the boxes across the shoulders with rope, although rendered imperative at times, did not conduce to the safety of the instru ment, as, owing to'the boxes being heavy and quite smooth without any rings or handles, the ropes slipped once or twice, letting the box fall to the ground. For this description of work it would probably be an advantage to have both boxes containing the theodolite made of equal size. The space thus gained in the box containing the vertical circle might well be utilised to form a compartment to contain angle books, pencils, rubber, ink, etc. The threads in the telescope were, as usual, of spider’s web. These suddenly broke when crossing the Lut Desert: possibly this may be ascribed to the dryness of the atmosphere, and the great variation between the day and night temperatures. In the circumstances it was impossible to find a spider’s web to obtain filaments to repair those broken. The Lut is absolutely bare even of the slightest sign of vegetation, and there is not a sign of life of any description. Luckily, one of the horizontal threads still held, and it was possible to continue the work. It is under- etood that some telescopes are now fitted with the lines engraved on glass diaphrams, and these would probably be better suited to the rough work, which an instrument is bound to meet on a journey through Persia. Moreover, the fitting of the spider’s web filaments, when available, is not a particularly easy job for an amateur in the open. The reconnoitring officer must, however, be prepared to undertake the job in case of necessity, learn how it is done by previous practice, and not trust to being able to learn from books in the field. The theodolite telescope supplied was an inverting instrument, not fitted with sightsAThis latter fact was to be regretted, as the sights enable the object to be picked up more rapidly. For an amateur, and for the nature of the work in Persia where tops of hills have to be observed on which there are no signals, it would be a great advantage to have an erecting telescope. Considering the comparatively rough nature of the work, the loss of power thereby involved would probably not be such as to justify the sacrifice of the gain in speed in picking up points, and tho minimising of errors due to the difficulty of always taking exactly the same point for observation when there is no artificial signal to observe on. In power the telescope left much to be desired when observing distant hills on a clear day. Some of the hills observed were as far ofi as 100 miles. Even at a distance of six miles it was found impossible to pick up a station where a cairn of stones some four feet high had been erected on the top of a hill previously visited. On the other hand, the power was such as to make observations on a hazy day al« ostm out of the question for any hill over ten miles distant, although the outline of the hill mi^ht be distinctly seen with the naked eye. In Persia, if there was suffi cient time, 0 it might be necessary to wait for clearer weather for days, weeks, or even months. Such a course is naturally out of the question in the case of a jour ney of which the primary object is not survey work. Officers proceeding to Persia should, therefore, take the precaution of seeing that their theodolite is fitted with interchangeable eye-pieces of high and low power. With practice it was found that the verniers could be read with sufficient accuracy to obtain time from a pair of east and west stars, with a probable maximum difference of one second between the pair. It would not be advjs- able for an officer to enter on the experiment of taking an instrument fitted with6 micrometers, without being fully assured that such an attachment would he capable of withstanding the extremely trying nature of the rough work which will assuredly be experienced in Persia. Even then he should also satisfy himself that he is thoroughly competent to repair and put the micrometers back into adjustment in the event of any possible accident. Plane Table. The small size of plane table was taken, and this was found to be a distinct dis* advantage. In every case, the large sized plane table as used by the Survey Depart ment should undoubtedly be selected. The increase in weight is not sufficient to counterbalance the disadvantage of having a board that will only just contain a square degree projection plotted at the scale of 4 miles = 1'. Persia is a country with enormous features, and, where they exist, triangulation points are few and far between, and have to be taken full advantage of. This is only rendered possible by the use of the large board. The Beam Compass and Diagonal Scale. The beam compass and diagonal scale issued were constructed for the purpose of making projections with co-ordinates 24 inches in length. The scale used in the field for geographical work, namely, that of 4 miles = l', does not require a co ordinate of greater length than 12 inches. This fact renders the carrying of such unwieldy instruments as those provided absolutely uncalled for : they take up a very inconvenient amount of space and are difficult to carry on a detached expedition, if the Survey of India long pattern of yakdan is not used. The traveller w r ould find it an infinite advantage to have both the beam compass and diagonal scale fitted into a box, the total length of which should not exceed 13—14 inches. There are now Military Surveyors at many of the Consulates in Persia, who ate at present provided with no instruments for the drawing of projections : it is strongly recommended that these men, when competent to use them, should be provided with instruments of the pattern suggested. Watches. Four Watches were taken. The best was one by the English Watch Company (value Rs. 300). The second was a chronometer stop watch. The other two were ordinary watches (value Rs. 75). None of these watches were of the slightest use as regards the determination of longitude by Meridian distances, as none of them had the slightest pretence to anything approaching a “ rate.” Even under the most favourable conditions on board ship the rate of the best watch varied by as much as 15 seconds in the 24 hours. On a journey in Persia it is impossible to attempt any longitude work on the move with chronometers. This is the opinion of all who have tried the experiment. The second watch noted above always stopped on the slightest excuse : it was sufficient to trot on a horse for a couple of yards, or to slip in coming down a hill to upset its interior economy. At Bam, and again at Kirman, work was undertaken for the determination of longitude by the exchange of telegraphic signals. Here it was found to be extremely difficult to estimate accurately the fractions of seconds working with such a small indicator as the seconds hand of a small watch. Anyone who undertakes such work in the future should take the precaution of carrying some form of larger watch or chronometer. This could be packed and carried safely, not being started until the scene of operations was reached ; and after the conclusion of the work it could again be relegated to the baggage.8 tomneratures of 10° F. are not uncommon in Persia in the winter months. The pattern of thermometer was most portable, and, with the exception of the above noted defect, was found to be most efTu lent. In addition to the thermometers issued by the Survey Department, use was also made of a Centigrade Aspirating Thermometer '“f ^ Department. This thermometer also had the same fault that it did not register au ite low enough, although it was better in this respect than the Survey Depart ment instrument. This pattern of thermometer is likely to give much more re liable results than is the case with the unguarded Survey Department pattern, which is liable to considerable error owing to the great amount of radiation in the Persian deserts. Perambulator. A perambulator was taken, but was not used. It is difficuit to find the motive power, if khala&amp;sis have not been taken for the purpose from India. 1 he perambulator, it is considered, cannot be very accurate owing to the extremely rough 1 nature o/the Persian roads, except in the desert. Lastly, its use on main roads is not at all advisable as attracting too much attention. Subtense Bar. A subtense bar was taken in the hope that it would be found useful for the purpose of measuring a base if necessary. It, however, was not used Lither there is not time available for the requisite number of readings with the theodolite, or it would be likely to attract too much attention. Plane Table Paper. The greater portion of the paper carried for use on the plane tables was procured ready mounted on linen. It was found more convenient to use tins paper by simply affixing it to the plane table by means of drawing pins and not by mounting with paste. The latter method was found to be most m- convenient, not to say impracticable at times, when moving fast. L case of its being determined to mount the plane tables in the regular m anne with paste, it would be necessary to make arrangements for spare tables on which the paper should be allowed to dry before being required. Lists of Trigonometrical Points. The lists of trigonometrical points supplied by the Survey Department wore not arranged in a form that admitted of easy reference. Consequently, when ever it was desired to prepare a projection, it was found necessary to go care- fullv through several sheets in order to ensure no available point being omitted. It is suggested that, if possible, lists should be maintained, kept up to date, arrang ed in groups according to the sheet to which they belong, and written m both English and Vernacular letters. In default of such lists the traveller would find it convenient to take all the 4 miles = sheets of the country affected by his iournev and previous to leaving India to enter down the margins the co-ordinates of every trigonometrical point on the sheet. At the same time he should draw scales of latitude and longitude on the borders, or take the precaution to obtain a latitude and longitude scale. This precaution, involving some small amount of trouble under circumstances where every advantage is at hand, will be amolv repaid by obviating its performance in the field, where time is lacking, where the drawing table is the plane table board balanced on one’s knees, and where the light may be furnished by a flickering candle. Thorough positions of points on the map are required in rough computations.9 - IWI I V Books of Tables, etc. , T The books carried were “ The Nautical Almanac,” Shortrede’s •• T.H.. of Logarithms, ’ Chambers’ “ Mathematical Tables ” “ Auxih'wv T, Kl„ ,*l Survey of India,” the B G S’s ‘‘Hinfq t ’ n „ xllj ^ r 3 r / a Dl e s of the cSlhir t^is°tcVd f ^ Vernacular.)

The only fault of these books is that, with rough usage, some of the pages may begin to tff 01 b and 111 ^ CaSe it; becomes necessary to secure by sewing through at Pencils. The matter of pencils may appear to be a small item, but, at the same ime,_it is an advantage in all mapping work to have a good pencil and somo mea n s of protecting the point. H. B., H. H., and H. H. H. H. are the most suit- Die grades tor reconnaissance work, each being best suited to different purposes.* 4 10 The best pattern of pencil is the “ Kuh-i-Nur,*' but it is difficult to obtain a good guard for the octagonal shape. The point should either be guarded by an efficient metal protector, or, and this was found to be more preferable, carried in a suitable pocket case, which can also be made to hold stylographic or fountain pens. Indelible pencils should be avoided. In the event of ram or water reaching any writing made with them, it is irretrievably lost. Pens. i The best patterns of pens are the “ Nota Bene” dwarf size stylographic, and the “ Pelican ’ ’ fountain; neither leak in the pocket. One stylographic pen, made of red vulcanite, was carried filled with red ink, whilst another stylographic pen and a fountain pen were carried with black ink. It was found that it is very difficult, owing to the nature of the surface, to write on the Survey Depart ment computation forms with the fountain pen ; this difficulty was, however, not found to be so great in the case of the stylographic pen. The latter was also found most useful for ruling lines. The ink was carried in the small patent travelling bottles made by the Swan Company for the purpose, and were refilled from time to time from a reserve stock carried in an ordinary stone ink bottle fitted with a rubber cork, and securely packed in a padded box. The ink used was De la Rue’s special fountain pen ink. One pint bottle was found to be more than sufficient for a five months’ journey, where copious notes were kept. The Slide Rule. Much time and trouble will be saved in taking out the various _ data for com putations from the tables by the use of the slide rule. When not in use for com putations it is found useful as an ordinary ruler. G* M. Press, Simla.—No. 62 I.
