Political Department. From, COLONEL R. THAYRE, c. b ., Political Supcrmtendcnfc and Commandant, Frontier L^pper Sind. To, THE COMMISSIONER IN SIND, KURRACHEE. Jrcohabad, 2nd October 1869. Sir, Referring to ray letter No. 269, of 18th February last, and the subsequent correspondence as per margin, regarding the '■ '^SrShA'prVi^ 2130 ' temporary agreement made with the Murree 2. Bombay Government Resolution Chiefs last February far the protection of Eastern .No. 1558, of 11th May 1869 (Poll- ^ # r _ tical Department). Cutchee, (not the Sind Frontier as erroneously 3. Bombay Government Resolution . , , i \ jpji No. 2071, of 29th June 18159 (Poll- stated in some ol the despatches), and 01 the tical Department.) Central Asian trade passing to and from the Kolan through, that Province ; I have the honor to- report that about a month ago Pallia Murree, and his gang, who it will be remembered were unjustly made prisoners by the Doombkees about this time last year, made a sudden and unexpected attack on the Doorabkees by way of revenge for that insult, and I regret to say killed some ten or fifteen men, and drove oft* a number of cattle.' 2. Shortly after this the Moondahee Murrees, who inhabit the country to 1 the north of Seebee and eastward to the Bolan, recommenced plundering in Cutchee on a large scale under their leader^ Kurrum Khan Begaranee. 3. Guzzen, the principal Chief of this clan, has done all he could to- pre vent this, but without success-; he attributes his failure to the want of co njuration on the part of the Khan of Khelat, whose people he declares, act as guides, and otherwise assist the Murrees in finding and driving of cattle. 4. The following paragraph from the petition, presented to me by the Murree Chiefs on the 4th February last, will prove that at the commencement of negotiations they considered the complete success of the experiment to depend upon that co-operation : — ' The proper protection of the Khan's country cannot be made without troops, and the influence of the principal Chiefs, such as Moolla Mahomedff and others. We will endeavour heartily to carry out any terms we may cc make with you, and under the command of God, we hope that no plundering &lt;c will take place in the Khan's country. If any'Murree should plunder there &lt;c wo would restore the plundered property : until however some settlement is ' made regarding- the Brahoee Chiefs and people in the Khan's territory, we ' are in great fear, because, through want of it, our efforts to serve the Govern- ct ment properly will be nullified. As however your honor may command, ' we will do, but we hope you will arrange for the settlement of the Khan's ' country as well as the Murree clan.' 5. This fact had been pressed upon me frequently from other sources, and hence my earnest endeavours last spring to effect a reconciliation between the Khan and his Chiefs ; but more especially with Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, who is looked upon by the Murrees as a martyr, and is a general favorite, particu larly of Kurrum Khan Begaranee and the Moondahee Murrees, near whose territory Moolla Mahomed's Mittra estate lies. G. It may I think be accepted as an axiom in this matter that, without the effectual eo-operation of a line of posts in Cutchee, no agreement with the Murrees, such as that under notice, will be of the least use. 7. The truth of this may be ascertained by comparing the results of pre cisely the same policy on the Punjaub border with those obtained in Cntchee- 8. Tn the latter case, the system being entirely unsupported by the Khans Oovernment, has collapsed. 9. In the former, it is auxiliary to Punjaub border arrangements, keeping the outposts informed of what is going on in the hills, warning them if any body of marauders is afoot, and is thus a complete success ; enabling the Punjaub outposts to prevent raids in some instances, and to recover stolen property in others. 10. In Cutchee, the border that it is our interest to protect, extends from the neighbourhood of Shahpoor to the foot of the Bolan Pass, at Dadur, m distance of about 80 to (K) miles, which is without a soldier, except at Bagh and Dadur, where a few are in garrison. 11. Were it not for the expediency of protecting the Central Asian trade which passes through part of that tract, we might cease to trouble ourselves about the matter, because, as we have no intention of re -occupying Shahpoor or any other post in Cutchee, and have no means at our disposal for subsidi zing men for the purpose, the tract referred to will never be safe either for tra vellers or the inhabitants themselves, until the Khan is on such terms with his Chiefs and people as to be able to leave the Citadel of Khelat and to throw some vigour into the Government of the Khanate. 12. Tinder these circumstances it is plain, I submit, that 10 Murree scouts r who have no outposts in Cutchee to resort to, can of themselves do nothing toward*.controlling 3,000 or 4,000 robbers who infest the border line above indicated ; and as the principal Murree Chief Guzzen has reported himself to be helpless for the reasons stated, I have discontinued the allowance of Rs. GOO per men- sem, pending further orders. 13. 1 attribute no blame whatever to Guzzen, who, on several occasions of petty raids during the past G months, has behaved very well indeed in restoring the stolen property ; neither do I blame the other Chiefs, because I know that where plunder was so easily obtainable as on the utterly undefended border ol Cutchee, it was out of their power to restrain their followers ; the tempta tion being too great. 14. Under all the circumstances, I have not allowed my own friendly relations with Guzzen to be affected, neither will it affect his relations with the I unjaub Officers, whose work he does well as an auxiliary. 15. 'W hen the Punjaub Officers and ourselves meet in a month or two for the purpose of carrying out the orders of His Excellency the Viceroy in Coun cil, conveyed in Bombay Government Resolution No. 2135, dated 3rd July last, and its accompaniments, we shall have an opportunity of re-discussing these matteis ■with the Chiefs themselves, when considering the questions upon which we are ordered to report.

Sir, Tn your Totter Xo. 1400, dated 2nd October last, yon mention that Gmt- 7en the jirineipal Clxief of the Murree clan, ' attributes his failure to the want ' of .^-operation on the part of the Khan of Khelat, whose people he declares ' act as -aides and otherwise assist the Murrees in finding and driving ot 'cattle.' 1 have the honor to request that you will inform me whether this is intended merely as a general statement, or whether Guzzen brings, or can W. a specific charge to this effect against any particular persons or tribes, snhjfcts of His Highness the Khan. If the latter, they should be distinctly named. 3. I should be more inclined to attribute the failure of the scheme to its being too limited in its scope j the amount paid to Guzzen being insufficient to include within the pecuniary advantages of the plan: that section o t ic iliirrees, under Kurrnm Khan, occupying the Moondahee country, and w 10 hold themselves aloof from the Kahua portion. I should be glad of your opinion and report also on this point. 3. • There can be no doubt that the only certain mode of ensuring peace and security throughout the territories of Khelat is by the establishment o; a strong ruling power in the country. If this was really the case, such an arrangement, as that entered into last February with the Murree Chiefs as a temporary expedient, would be quite unnecessary. i. Our efforts therefore should be primarily devoted to this object, and in all said or done on the Frontier, this principle should be kept carefully m y jpw. In communications with the people of that country, it should be parti- culailv regarded, and while it is explained that it is the earnest desire ol the British Government to see a firm and united kingdom in Beloochistan, the Chiefs j»11 cordially rallying round and assisting the legitimate head, the pro ceedings of those who are acting in opposition to the ruler will invariably &gt;0 disapproved and receive no countenance whatever. 5. I allude eRpecially to Sirdar Moolla Mahomed Raisanee, whom you mention as being looked upon by the Murrees as a mart}i. ihe tffuits ma .e last spring to restore him to favor with His Highness the Khan ^eieentirely defeated by his own wrong headedness. The conditions given him by the Khan were most liberal and generous, but he perversely refused to accept them, and now he has himself alone to blame that he does not fill his proper position. It would be well to take every opportunity of pointing this out, that it may not be imagined by these wild people that their view of the case is entertained by the British authorities. C). I 1 kt\c also to request that you will obtain from Captain Harrison, Political Agent with His Highness, a report showing in detail what, if any, arrangements have been made for the protection of merchants passing through the J Solan and Ccitcheo, both before and since the withdrawal of the payment to the Murrees* I have, &amp;c., 'VV.

I will however ask him when I see him. 2: I oelieve that the scheme was too limited in its scope. It was only entered upon for a year at furthest by the Murrees themselves ; more, as I expressed at the time,, out of deference to us y than for any actual advantage that the} would gain by it. I regarded it myself as an experiment that might lead to better relations, and this I hope may be the case when wo pro ceed to carry out the orders of His Excellency the Viceroy in Council. .5.

I liave the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1785, of the 14th instant, and in compliance therewith, have the honor to forward a statement of raids committed since August 1868. I cannot guarantee its correctness, having no records in my possession prior to taking charge, and sub sequent raids not having been reported to me, with the exception of the last named and that committed on the Tullanees. 2. Prior to the subsidizing of the Murrees, His Highness as a rule- stationed 2 companies of infantry and a couple of guns at Dadur and Lehree. The Doombkees, the most warlike tribe in Cutchee, were subsidized to the extent of 120, and were supposed to keep a general look out against the Murrees. Smaller parties of Belooch horse were stationed at Dadur, Bagh, Ivundah and Gundava. These plans were modified through some misapprehension on His Highness' part, as explained in my demi-official from Dadur, 2.4th October 1809. 3. On the subsidy being withdrawn about four months ago, Nawal&gt; Mahomed Khan went to Cutchee and organized a» more perfect system of out- I)adur 100 posts, placing detachments at the pla-ces named Hajee -Ke-Shere ... ... so in my letter No. 54,—strength as per mannn.

The Murrees then attempted to escape, eighteen of them were killed. The Doombkees had nine of their party wounded, and one Tullanee killed. V V - * T have, &amp;c.r C. 11.

When I forwarded my letter No. 1 LOT; da'ted 2n'(l OstObor, to Captain Harrison for perusal, it reached him at Dadur as just stated, and he replied as follows :— * * * ' Referring to that part of your letter which attributes the late raids in Cutchee to want of co-operation on tiie part of His Highness, I think XT m. • it is. only fair to state the reasons he gave when IS otk .— I hns tne\Mvere commnm- ■ \ # . cated to His Highness by the Vakeel your opinions on this subject were communica- —S lc below. ted to him through Vakeel Mahomed Khan. it, 1 HA THE. . V He said that his own arrangements for the peace and safety of Cutchee falling short of what was required, the English Government most generously took the matter in hand, and that it was thought that a monthly subsidy would offer sufficient inducement to the » - * ... Murrees to cease their malpractices. Under these circumstances His Highness felt that active measures on his part would mar the project in view, and that See my letter of 20th March, given ^ might be considered that he did not appre- beluw in refutation of this. ciate your efforts to restore peace and quiet in that part of his country, if his detachmentswere stationed as licretofore 3 with instructions to attack tlie Murrees whenever opportunity offered.

P. merits of his.'' * * * 4 I must confess that I was a good deal surprised at this view, consi dering what had really taken place as described below ; but wishing to avoid further discussion, and hoping that all would come right at the approaching conference in the hills, as ordered by His Excellency the A iceroy, I merely wrote to Captain Harrison to the effect that the Khan's plea was not right, because Vakeel Mahomed Khan had been present on the part of His Master at all the interviews which Captain Sandeman, Mr. Bruce, and myself had had. with the Murree Chiefs and others regarding this business, and that he fully understood how repeatedly the Murrees themselves wished to excuse them selves from entering upon a fixed agreement on the small subsidy of lis. 600 per mensem, owing to the utterly undefended state of Eastern Cutchee, which we exhorted His Highness the Khan through his A akeel to improve, instead of which. It is seen from Captain Harrison s note, that he actually removed or in other words ' modified' some of his posts by way of help. 5. Seeins: that the whole of these circumstances were well known to Captain Harrison himself, I did not expect him to recur to the subject in his report Xo. 56, dated 27th instant ; but as he has done so, I have no alterna tive but to bring forward all the facts of the case ; because the endeavour to prevent the Murrees from plundering in Cutchee was merely in sequence to the Punjab arrangements sanctioned by the Government of India and the Home Government ; and as such, ought to have led Captain Harrison to point out to the Khan, when lie learnt the line of action he had taken, that His Highness could have adopted no surer way of thwarting' those arrangements and of producing the ' negative results' which as a matter of course followed, than by reducing his posts instead of augmenting, or at all events stimulating, them to continue on the alert. 6. The following facts make His Highness' conduct appear in a most marked li^ht, and it is matter of sincere regret to me that the Political o 7 o Agent has failed to penetrate the very flimsy veil which the Khelat Govern ment has thrown over their adverse action in this instance ; indeed, the omission may have an injurious effect upon our future arrangements with these tribes, based upon the orders of His Excellency the Viceroy, con veyed in the Eoreign Secretary's letter dated 25th June last. But, whe ther or no, I respectfully submit that it bears out my earnest recommendationthat the Government should be fully informed upon the lights and shades of ivhelat history, before we enter upon any further arrangements whatever with the Khan or his subjects, as these negative results' have lasted by far too long. 7. I have said that His Highness' Vakeel, Mahomed Khan, was present at every interview which the Punjaub Officers and myself had with the hill- people at the beginning of this year, and the Copies of all letters to and from i r-i opo 3 i ,i i the tribes were given to him. close of 18G8,and he was consequently thorough ly well aware that while I undertook to employ a few of the Murrees as police for the purpose of preventing the tribe from plundering in Cutchee and to apprehend offenders ; he, on the Khan's part, was to look to the then existing arrangements for guarding Eastern Cutchee and the Kafila route particularly, which, both he and his master knew per fectly well, are guaranteed hy Treaty, and could not possibly be affected, except for the better, by any separate and extra arrangements which cost the Khan nothing. 8. I find, on referring to my records, that in about three weeks after the departure of the tribes from Jacobabad, I received a letter from Sohrab Khan, the Chief of the Doombkees, complaining that the Kukkul Murrees, who were in rebellion from Guzzen at that time, had been threatening to plunder in Cutchee. I therefore repeated my former exhortations in the following ver nacular letter dated 26th March 18G9 :— 'To, Mahomed Khan, Vakeel of His Highness the Khan of Khelat. After Compliments,—» I have received Sohrab Khan's petition, and send a copy of it for your perusal. Having become acquainted with its contents, please make proper arrangements for the border of Cutchee, These Kukkul Murrees are not subject to Guzzen Khan at present, and it is therefore necessaiy that your arrangements should be made with care. Do not be slack in this. Make great exertions regarding it. I have myself made great efforts for the welfare of the Khan's country, and my earnest advice to His Highness is, that he will be pleased to order proper arrangements to be made for the safety ofhiu own pco- I j U and country. K. Pilvyue , Colonel, Political Superintendent.^9. I submit that T could scarcely have written in stronger terms ; and when I add, that every day, when I am present in Jacobabad, (Sundays ex cepted) the A akeel sits at my table in the Durbar room during the transaction of business, and that I discussed all these matters with him orally, and then in writing, if necessary ; it will be seen that there was no room whatever for the alleged &lt;f misapprehension,' but that in point of fact, the old habit of thwaiting with a ^iew to negative results' was simultaneously being practised in the Murree affairs under report and the cause of the Sarawan Sirdars, who about this time were leaving Jacobabad for Khelat. KL In addition to the aboVe evidencej my records will show that cn the 24th May I received a long letter from the Murree Chief complaining about various matters, and that next day (25th) I again wrote to Mahomed Khan. 11. Mattels w ent on very well up to the 15th July when, in consequence of the orders that a report would be required by the Government of India re garding the working of the new arrangements,. I addressed the Vakeel and asked him how the interests of Cutchee had been affected by them. 12. The reply w as most satisfactory, to the eftect that the people had derived great benefit from the system up to that time. 13. Within a week afterwards the change came, by an attack being made on the Khyherees ; because the latter, un- There would appear to be some i c , i i mistake here.

L. M brbwethbr . to ensure the safety of their property. 14. I only learnt the real truth of this story from a Murree who visited me not long ago, both the Khyherees themselves and the Vakeel having concealed it from me ; I however both wrote and spoke on the subject, as I consider that these poor people have been very badly treated by the Khan's Government. 15. On the 21st July I received another long letter from Guzzen, descri bing Cutchee as ' the country without a Euler.' On the 31st July another similar letter. On 9th August another, all of which I discussed orally with the Vakeel. 16. On the 2Stli August I received another, which I forwarded to Cap tain Harrison, with an earnest request that he would move the Khan on the matter. This appears to have had the effect of bringing about the arrange ments detailed in Captain Harrison's letter No. 5G under reply. 1 &lt;. I fear from all I have seen and heard that the Khan is absorbed with an e t r undue desire of again eniovinar the extm subsi- Sec correspondence m May 1862, D J ^ s between the Commissioner and Sir dy of Us. 50,000, which was discontinued, owing H. Gitui, iso. 354, ot -5th Maj. failed to secure the objects for which it was granted, I believe now that jealousy as the likelihood of oureventually granting a portion' of this Sum to the Murrces prompted Ins extra ordinary action as reported by Captain Harrison. I have armed at tins con clusion by observing the incessant allusions made by His Highness' Vakeel to this grant, and the inordinate desire to secure it; but the more conversant I become with Khelat affairs, the more convinced I am that we can never again entrust the uncontrolled disbursement of that sum to the Khelat Govern ment, as done in the case of the ordinary annual subsidy. is Matters have altered considerably since Major Green's letter to the Khan of April 1800 was written. The Khelat revenues are annually increa- Sins, both directly and indirectly, from the advantages of our alliance and proximity to our territory I and the continuation of the Biggarce Cana t us vear through a part of His Highness' territory, regarding which 1 am now niakin' arrangements with the Executive Engineer through Captain Harrison, will bring under cultivation a considerable area of valuable land whic «i still farther benefit tlie State. 10. As Captain Harrison does not guarantee the accuracy of his list of raids, I offer no comment regarding it, but if requisite can give a list of that were reported to me. 20. When I believed that the exploring expedition would have started about the present time. 1 wrote to His Highness the Khan explaining its object, and received the following reply : &lt;c To, The Political Superintendent, Prontier L pper Sind.

The scheme failed, cWefly owing to its limited scope, in wlueh opinion Colonel Phayre concurs. It had to he given up in October last, because the Moondaee branch of the Murree tribe, who were not included in the pecuni ary allowance, recommenced plundering on a large scale in Cutchee. There had been some minor raids before, hut these seem to have been properly ac counted for, as Colonel Phayre states the Chief Guzzen ' on several occasions ' of petty raids during the past 6 months has behaved very well indeed in *' restoring the stolen property. 3 It is also stated that Gnzzen attributed his failure to the want of co-operation on the part of the Khan of Khelat, whose people he declared acted as guides, and otherwise assisted the Murrees in finding and driving of cattle. I requested Colonel Phayre in letter No. 791, of 27th November, (copy appended) to inform me whether this statement of Guzzen's was a mere general one, or whether any specific charge could be brought against any one person or tribe. Copy of that officer's reply is also appended, from which it will be seen that Guzzen primarily alluded to the Tullanee case, reported No. 1005, of 15th June 1869, from on in June last, copies of correspondence here- Political Superintendent F.

This was a raid by the Murrees No 410, dated 19th June 1869, from ® • x xi, •p' ,1 Commissioner in Sind. on the loth April last agamst the K\ heieef dwelling at Moonree near Phoolajee. The Tullanees, who are a branch of the Doombkee tribe, residents of Lehree in the plains close to the Murree lulls, and considered to be obedient subjects of His Highness the Khan, joined m the attack, as is often done in these border forays. The charge of acting as o-uides &amp;c. refers then to them, as no others are specified, and Guzzen s other remarks were supposed to be general. 4.

U. s. e( ] for 3 enters into at length the question Oil support which Guzzen expected to have received from His Highness the Khan, in the shape of posts of troops disposed over Cutchee, and which Captain Harrison says were not placed under a misapprehension of His Highness the Khan. Whether the absence of these posts was accidental or not' is useless to discuss now, hut it is quite clear that if they were required, as well as the subsidy to the Murrees, the latter had better not have been granted, as far as any relief to His Highness went in the way of protecting the trade line through Cutchee. 5. One advantage however is gained by the experiment that lias been made and by this correspondence relating to it, which is, that it is conclusively proved that no scheme which does not command the good behaviour of the whole of the Murrec tribe is of any real use. That in entering into thc.so arrangements, care should be taken that nothing is hastily decided and carried out, O 7and tliat thongh we may assist in collateral ways, any plan adopted towards Murrees or Boogtees, or any other subjects of His Highness the Khan, should only be worked as emanating from him, and as being done with his full con currence and knowledge of all details. 6. The remaining subjects touched on by Colonel Phayre in the cor respondence now submitted, have been so fully entered into already, that it is unnecessary to remark again on them now. I must however in conclusion express my regret at the tenor of Colonel Phayre's letter No. 1838, of the 30tli December, and my opinion that it convinces me more than ever of the necessity of his having an early interview with His Highness the Khan, and conference with the Wuzzeer Healyanee Wullee Mahomed, not merely that he may obtain clearer information with regard to the real state of the Khelat Government than he hitherto has been in a position to acquire, but that he may be led to view the motives and actions of that Government in a more correct and favora ble light. Also that he should be able to accord that perfect confidence in the Political Agent, Captain Harrison, which I am concerned to observe, from the correspondence generally, is not reposeJ as it should be, or, as Captain Harrison's able and judicious conduct since he has been at Khelat, merits, and without which it is impossible that proper relations with the Foreign Court can b3 satisfactorily or advantageously maintained. I have, &amp;c., W. L. MEREWETHEE.
