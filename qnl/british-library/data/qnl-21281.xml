HINAIDI. 18th September 1934* Purchase of land at Bahrein by His Majesty^ Government. P Sir, I have the honour to refer to the recent purchase of land at BAHREIN by His Majesty's Government, and to request that consideration may be given to the question of the future administration of this property. wcS 8 * From Air Ministry letter S.31443/D.0,I», dated 'w • V \ 31st May 1934, in which instructions were given for a V Royal Air Force representative to check over the title deeds of this property and to inspect and arrange for the upkeep of the boundary pillars, it would appear that it is the intention of the Air Ministry that these lands shall be administered by the Royal Air Force. If this is the intention, the provisions of paragraph 131 of Air Publication 855 will presumably apply, and it will be necessary to arrange for the annual perambulation of the boundaries, maintenance and -checking of boundary stones, the registration of encroachments, the annual closing of paths across the property to prevent the development of rights of way, etc. It may be mentioned that the only Air Ministry property in Bahrein hitherto administered by the Works and Buildings Department is the Rest House, which stands in a comparatively small area of land surrounded by a high wall. 3./ ?he Secretary, Air Ministry, f. 0. 2k7 (/ ) v r 3. Prom India Office confidential letter p.S.3297/34, dated 22nd May 1934, which was forwarded under cover of the Air Ministry letter referred to ahove, it would appear that the originals of the title deeds of this property have been deposited in thi India Office, copies 'being retained in the Agency at BAHREIN and at the Residency in BUSHIHE. It is therefore not clear whether it is the intention that these properties shall be administered on behalf of the India Office by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and it is desired that a ruling shall be given defining the responsibilities of th® Royal Air Force in this matter# It is not known what facilities are available to the Political Agent for the administration of properties in BAHREIN. 4. In Air Publication 855, para. 95(2) it is laid down that the original deeds relating to Air Ministry property abroad shall be kept by the Chief Engineer of the command concerned, and it is desired, further, to know whether, in the event of a decision being given that this property shall be administered by the Royal Air Force, these title deeds are to be transferred from the India Office to this Headquarters for custody by the Chief Engineer^ 5« The question also arises of the administration of the property at JUFAIR, which has been purchased by the Air Ministry on behalf of the Admiralty. In order to preserve the fiction that this is Air Ministry property, it would appear desirable that this land shall be administered by the same authorities who will administer the land at MUHARRAQ and MANAMAH. In the event of the Royal Air Force being the administrative authority, it would appear desirable for the Air Ministry to ask the Admiralty for instructions as to the future occupation of this land, and to decide the method of recover7 3. recovery of expenditure. In the interests of secrecy, a charge to Vote 4 in the first instance, with a -periodical confidential report to the Air Ministry of the expenditure incurred would seem to be a suitable course. 6» The question regarding the scheduling and valuation of the fish traps at MUHARRA^ and MANAMAH, and the payment of compensation to the owners, is being taken up with the Political Agent, BAHREIN, and a further communication on this matter will be addressed to you at a later date. 7.

It is suggested that the Political Agent might administer these estates oi&gt;6ur behalf, and if this can be arranged, it is requested that the forthcoming survey should cover the possibilities of this, and give particulars of anticipated revenues and annual expense of upktep.

My dear Seal, I write with reference to the Commander-in-Chief's telegram to the Admiralty of 19th December, No .359, about the use by the Navy for recreational purposes of the land recently purchased at Bahrain on behalf of the Admiralty. 2. You will no doubt be consulting us about this. But one's first reaction is that it is unfortunate that any impression should have leaked out at Bahrain that the land is Naval property, and secondly that it would be most undesirable, by allowing the land to be used for Naval recreational purposes, to lend any colour to that impression in so far as it may exist. Subject to tyour views and those of the Foreign Office, we here should, I think, therefore be disposed to suggest that it would be better to leave things as they are. 3 I am sending a copy of this letter to Rendel Yours sincerely. sd.J.G.Laithwaite .Seal Esquire, AdmiraltyConflo; at-.-i, .

The title deeds of these lands, together with a letter from His rilxcellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ' Isa al Khalifah, were recently forwarded to t')is Headquarters by the Political Agent, Bahrein for reproduction. Photographic reproduction of these documents has no?/ been made, and the originals together with two copies have been returned to the Political Agent, Bahrein, for transmission to the India Office. Three copies of these documents together with three copies of the detailed survey carried out by Major Papworth, are being forwarded under separate cover. The third copy has been included for transmission to the Admiralty. 3. ouring December, 1934, Air Commodore Bl.L. Gossage, D,S.O. , l.C. , and the Chief Engineer of this Command visited ..bahrein, and discussions between them and the Political Agent, bahrein^ and the Financial Adviser to the Bahrein/ Secretary, Air Mini ^try, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C.2.Bahrein GoYernment took place regarding the future administration of these lands. It is considered that the arrangements which have now been made ore satisfactory. ^* (i ) Air Ministry letter 8, 31443/1).0.1. dated 4th October. 1934« Paragraph 5 . Arrangements are being made to have this site cleared of r?ed huts during the next two years. The Political A.gent, Bahrein, hopes to have this completed within a year, but hns in any case undertaken there shall be no huts remaining in two years 1 time. P?ra£raph 6. The purchase of this additional strip of land on behalf of the Admiralty was reported to Air inistry in this Headquarters message A.0.4. of the 19th January, 1935, and a reply is now awaited. Paragraph 7 . The two remaining houses are in a bad state of repair, and it is not considered a practicable proposition to let them. It is submitted, therefore, that they be demolished and the material sold. Efforts will th^n be msde to let the gardens separately. The Financial Adviser to the Bahrein Government is willing to deal with this matter. Your approval to this is requested so that action may be taken accordingly. A ' &gt; ^ t;W f 11 ) Air Ministry letter S. 31443/D.0.1. dated 7 1' i ?: o v am b e r 193 47 ' '' 11 is considered preferable that the financial Adviser to the Bahrein Government should administer these estates on our behalf rather than the work: shall be unaertaken by the Political Agent, as the Financial Adviser has a far better knowledge of local prices. The Financial Adviser has agreed to undertake this. Paragraph 5,. It is not yet possible to give details of the anticipated revenues from these estptes, but it is not thought that they will amount to any appreciable sum. It/3. It is also considered that the annual expense of upkeep would be practically nil. 5. When approval as requested in paragraph 4 (i) above has been received, the matter will be taken up with the financial Adviser to the Bahrein Government, and any arrangements made will be reported to Air ministry.

It is suggested that the Political Agent might administer these estates on our behalf&gt; and if this can 'be arranged, it is requested that the forthcoming survey should cover the possibilities of this, and give particulars of anticipated revenues and annual expense of upkeep. Amy amount due to or from the Admiralty shoula be separated and if as we assume there is little involved, we could take the whole charge to Air Votes. 4. In regard to paragraph 4 of your letter, I am to say that it has been decided that the provisions of paragraph 95(2) of Air Publication 855 may be waived in this instance and copies only of the title deeds held by the Chief Engineer.

Consideration is now being given to dispensing with the present Landing Ground at Manama, for which the Royal Mr Force pay the Sheikh of Bahrein a rent of Z120 per annum. It is proposed to retain only the aero drome on the Island of Muharraq. This change in policy will entail giving the Sheikh of Bahrein 12 months notice to terminate the agreement made with him on 5th May, 193:. Before doing this I should like to have your views on the effect of this locally in Bahrein, and also an explanation from you as to the precise terms on which the Landing Ground at Muharrao is hired or leased from the Sheikh of Bahrein. / 7 Air Yice Ma rsha 1. commandM^ British Forces in IranConfidential Wo:C/175.

The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian U ulf, Bushire• Ro7/al Air Force landing Ground at Mcinamah. P 1M- Sir, UqV / I have the honour to enclose a copy of a Memorandum No:S.11030/2 dated the 22nd February 1S35 from the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in 'Iraq, regarding the landing grounas at Manamah and Muharraq and of mj'' reply No:C/l73 dated the 13th March 1955. 2. I cannot offer an useful opinion on the technical side of the question whether the -^oyal Air Force should end (at 12 % months 1 notice) the agreement under which they use the existing ground at Manamah. I would, however, recommend that they shouM consult the i^aval Authorities, as the Manamah landing ground is very close to Jufair and it may happen tnat it would be valuable: both to them and to the Royal Air Force in certain circumstan ces. Once the area is given up, it will be impossible to prevent gardens or houses being made on it. 3. There is, hovever, another aspect of the question. V.hen the Civil Air Agreement was made, a separate exchange of letters with His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa A1 Khalifah took place (see the enclosures to my letter No:C/588 dated the 11th June 1934) and provided for priority in the use of M any aerodromes which may be establisheo- or maintained lor civil aircraft' by aircraft belonging to or employed in the service of His Majesty 1 s Government 'when His Majesty*s(iovernment consider that circumstances require it'. This exchange of letters, however, merely provided for an emergency and was not designed to cover the ordinary day's work# 4» me position is that the ■^•oyal ^ir -^orce have the ri^ht under tneir agreement to use the landing ground at ^ctnamah and have also been allowed by the courtesy of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad to use that at Muharraq (for which I send him a request whenever use of it is necessary). Save, therefore, when nis Majesty's Government consider that circumstances require it, the Royal Air Force cannot, as of right, use the Muharraq landing ground. 5. I feel confident that His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad would give permission for the use of the Muharraq landing ground in ordinary times (as in fact he does now by giving permission on each occasion), but I also feel that it would create an unfortunate impression locally if we were to give up the landing ground at Manamah and at the same time ask to be allowed to make use of the Muharraq landing ground in ordinary times without payment. 6. In all the circumstances I would advise that the landing ground at Manamah be retained and that I ask His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad to give a general permission for aircraft of the Royal Air Force to land at Muiriarraq instead of Manamah when they find it more convenient to do so without getting his specific permission on each occasion. i have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant.

He will, I hope, soon be back at duty again. In your letter, you asked that, whenever service land planes intended to visit Bahrein, you should be informed whether ^hey were to land at Manama or Muharraq. If you will be good enough to refer to our official letter jof similar reference dated 22nd February, 1935., you : will see that we propose to abandon the use of 'Manama aerodrome altogether. r f u. We realise that this change of policy will mean our paying the Shaikh of Bahrein a rent of £120 for one year for facilities which we do not now require, but this cannot be helped. It may therefore be accepted as a definite rule that service land planes visiting Bahrein will, in future, invariably use Muharraq aerodrome. When, therefore, you receive warning of a proposed visit by service land planes to Bahrein, I presume that you will, in each case, be good enough to obtain the formal permission of the Shaikh for the aircraft to use the Muharraq \jLanding ground. s Mention of the latter recalls the ultimate paragraph of our official letter of 22nd February, 1935., already referred to. We should be glad of an explanation from you as to the precise terms according to which the landing ground at Muharraq is used by the Royal Air Force and Imperial Airways whether in fact it is hired or leased from the Shaikh of Bahrein, iy IQ&gt;&gt; A.

MEMORAM)TJM: lO l' ' With reference to rrty letter No :429/29/LD. of the S7th October, 1935. I have received another letter from the three Sunni Kadis regarding 1 the Sunni mosoue at Jafair. They ask that an opening in the wall which is being built by the TTavy should be made opposite to the houses occupied by the people who use the mosque. These houses are on the north side of Jafair close to the house of Shaikh Muhammad bin Rashid A1 Khalifah. At present there is no opening in the wall, the users of the mosque complain that they are cut off from it and the Kadis are becoming seriously perturbed about the matter. I have assured them that the Government made a special arrangement guaranteeing a right of way to the mosque and I think that stens shouDd be taken to ensure the right of way beinrr left. The ouestion of mosques and graveyards is one which is regarded by the local inhabitants very seriously and I think the matter of the right of way should be settled as soon as possible as it is causing some comment locally.

In this connection they have given him a map show ing where it would be needed. On the south west corner of their square there is an area marked, on Government land, described as 'proposed site for Imperial Airways'. Gan you explain what this site is intended for? If airways propose purchasing land and erecting buildings it will affect our plans for electric power. Would it be possible for you to give us any idea of the probable requirements of the Besidency if and when it comes to Muharraq? I have not referred to airways direct as the plan is marked 'Confidential'. Before working out a scheme for carrying power to the R.n.F. site, we would like to have as many particulars as possible.

The principal correspondents in the file are Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, Political Agent in Bahrain, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, and officials from Air Headquarters in Iraq, and the India Office and Air Ministry in London.The correspondence deals with outstanding issues related to the purchase of land, including responsibility for its maintenance, ownership of the fish traps, huts and date palms remaining on the land, and copies of title deeds. The greater part of the volume’s correspondence concerns the plots of land at Jufair, purchased covertly by the Government on behalf of the Admiralty. In late 1934 the British Government purchased an additional strip of land between the two existing plots at Jufair, in order to create a single plot (folio 24). This purchase meant that a mosque, used by the area’s Sunni community, was now surrounded by British property, resulting in arrangements having to be made to maintain public access to it.The volume also contains correspondence concerning the Air Admiralty’s decision to abandon their aerodrome at Manama in preference for the new aerodrome at Muharraq. The explanation for this move, as detailed in the officiating Political Agent’s letter to Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah, was that the soil at Manama was unsuitable for the modern, heavier aircraft (folios 102-03).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003e4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
