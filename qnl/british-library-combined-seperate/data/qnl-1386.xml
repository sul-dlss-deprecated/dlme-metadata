Also discussed is the Company’s interest in securing further tax exemptions from the Bahrain Government in relation to establishing a refinery; an agreement to increase the minimum amount of royalty paid by BAPCO to the Bahrain Government; and the desire of the Shaikh of Bahrain to ensure that every effort would be made to employ Bahraini subjects at the refinery once complete.Other matters discussed in the volume include:BAPCO’s intention of loaning American refinery construction workers from the Standard Oil Company of California to work on construction of the refinery at Bahrain, and arrangements with the British Consul-General in San Francisco (Cyril H Cane) for the issuing of visas to the relevant individuals;the drafting of a deed which would modify the mining lease between BAPCO and the Government of Bahrain in order to enable the erection of a refinery in Bahrain, and the procedures required for its signature in Bahrain. A copy of the original mining lease can be found at folios 6-16, and a copy of the deed modifying the lease can be found at folios 167-170.BAPCO’s intention of attempting to acquire some of the plant for the refinery from Germany and the need for the plant to be accompanied by 2 Germans to assist in its erection and to oversee the training of BAPCO staff in its use.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 213-217.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum refineries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Taxation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028f#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
