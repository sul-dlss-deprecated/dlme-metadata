Mendel's letter of 27th torch below, the Foreign Office are particularly anxious tnat tnere snoulo. be no delay in his return to trie Gulf owing to the stage which the Koweit oil negotiations have reached, and I fear in the circumstances it will not be possible to agree to the xtesident’s deputation being followed by two months leave. The Foreign Office and Colonial Office, with whom I nave discussed the point, feel very strongly as to tnis and are anxious that he should return with the minimum of delay. 7/e can indicate in our reply the reasons which necessitate this decision and suggest tdat Colonel Fowle might come on leave later in the summer. He will unfortunately be the loser to the extent of a free passage, but in the circumstances that cannot be helped. We have just received a telegram to the elfect that sir John Cadiran visited Koweit accompanied by/y c^’ his staff on 2.5th torch ana haa a long aiscussion vath the Sheikh, in the course of which he states that 'ail earns were put on the table and the Sheikh was offered quite exceptionally generous financial terms to induce him to grant the concession to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, The Sheikh responded by saying thut he must consult Holmes” (i.e# the Sastern and General syndicate). The Political ^gent adds that he was assured by Sir John Cabman 'that he would return to tiie charge as soon as the situation in Tehran permitted.' This, so far as it goes, is probably to the good* But the situation remains rather obscure* The Foreign Cilice, in the light of the telegram quoted, would like to think further about the suggestion in paragraph 5 of to. Hendel*s letter of 27th torch that the Resident should be instructed 'to take whatever steps he thinks likely to prove most effective w ‘to ensure that the Sheikh does not reach a decision irrrr return.

I ought to have let you know before that the secretary of Gtate approved (with some verbal modifications) the private telegram of which I sent you an advance copy, and that it issued to the Viceroy | on 23rd larch, we hope for a very early reply (though the Viceroy my wish to consult Fowle before sending one) and I will let you know at once as soon as it is received. As you say, it would hardly be physically possible to get the Resident here, even if the Government of India are agreeable to hie coming, before April 18th at the earliest. And there is the further objection to bringing him home at a moment’s notice that a sudden visit with nothing to lead up to it might well be the cause of comment in the Gulf and might/ i.G.,/\ might conceivably be associated with the oil negotiations* I see no difficulty about sending a telegram to Fowls on the lines suggested in the third paragraph of your letter once a decision has been taken as regards his visit. As regards the question of expenditure I note that the Treasury agree that it shall be shared 50/50 as part of the Diplomatic and Consular expenditure. This is entirely satisfactory from our point of view. I am sending a copy of this letter to Blaxter and am letting starling and itlvett-Garnac know tn-t the Secretary of state has privately consulted the Viceroy about Powle f s visit. J.Gc.

Petroleum Department, Board of Trade, Dean Stanley street, 3.W. 1.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.Y/.l., 27th March, 1933. (E 1533/12/91) My dear Gilbert, I am sorry to have been so long in replying to your letter of March 22nd enclosing your draft private and personal telegram to the Viceroy about Fowled proposed visit to England, but the papers have been under submission and only ^st returned to me, 2 . I now write to let you know that my higher authorities here entirely concur in the proposal that Fowle should be brought home to consult in the manner suggested. They are, however, very uneasy lest, if Fowle's visit here and/or return to the Gulf should beAlternatively they suggest that he should he instructed before leaving the Gulf to do what he can to ensure that no decision is taken in his absence. 3. I do not know whether your telegram has yet gone off, and in any case it hardly seems physically possible now to get Fowle here before April 18th at the earliest. Moreover, it now appears from Bushire telegram No. 3 of March 22nd to the Colonial Office, of which a copy was sent to you by the Colonial Office in their Printed Letter No. 18268/33 of March 23rd, that Holmes may be leaving Kov/eit for Egypt and possibly Jedda and Riyadh in the immediate future, so that it looks as though he might be away during Howie 1 s absence. As he is obviously the sort of unscrupulous person who would take full advantage of Fowled absence, this is all to the good. In these circumstances you may think it sufficient to send a separate telegram to Fowle, as soon as the instructions about his return to England have been issued, instructing him to take whatever steps he thinks likely to prove most effective.•effective - without of course letting it he thought that he is coming home merely to consult us on the subject of the Koweit oil concession - to ensure that the Sheikh does not reach a decision until his return. 4 . I should be gateful if you would let me know as soon as possible what you cbfc*- ^ . 5. As regards the question of the expenses of Powle's visit / which you mentioned in your letter to me of March 22nd, I have spoken to Woods of the Treasury as you suggested, and he tells me that the arrangementjj by which 5 C$ of the cost will be included in our annual adjustment of accounts of Persian expenditure, and thus come on the diplomatic and consular vote, will be quite in order. 6 . I am sending a copy of this letter to Blaxter. Yours everJ * i * 7 *! T t I » . t v O -7 ( C: -T^ C; P. @ s f,D Xi h Mr • WaJ/£on, Under Secretary of State, A meeting took place this afternoon further to consiaer the question of Koweit oil, the Petroleum Department toeing anxious to send further supplementary instructions to the Resident with a view to ensuring that he fully understood what was in the mind of H.L.U. The other Departments represented (Colonial Office, Foreign Office, Admiralty and India Office) pointed out the difficulty of sending a dditional telegrams ana the danger of confusing the Resident toy conflicting instructions. 2. After consideratole discussion, not only of Koweit oil, tout of various other outstanding Gulf questions, the general sense of tne meeting was that it would toe extremely desiratole^if the Government of India would agreeJto invite Colonel Fowle to this ' *V VM country for, say, a fortnight/ arriving on 18th April cy- •» L\Tt~0' and leaving on 29th April/(travelling toy air tooth ways). Not only would it toe possitole while he was here to discuss Koweit oil, tout difficult questions wets- likely to arise in connection with the Gulf air route. Iton 3aud's/— r- — J2 . 3/ Saul's blockade of Koweit, possibly the Date Garaens, ^ (Tnd fhe alternative to Henjam coula also be examined. In addition, there was a strong feeling that Colonel Powle,having taken over on the unexpected death of Sir Hugh Biscoe,/fiad no opportunity of general aiscussion with any Department of H.It.G. and that it would be of great advantage not only in such informal aiscussions with him as a short visit would permit, but in establishing personal contact. 3. In the event of the proposal being approved it woula be necessary to put the Resident on deputation for the short period involved and to pay r , his pasages to ana fro. The expenditure would be divided (like his salary) equally between Indian and Imperial revenues as part of general D.&amp; C. expenditure. 4. Colonel Loch, now Political Agent, Bahrein, would presumably act for the Resident. Some difficulty might be experienced in finding a substitute for Colonel Loch, but at a pinch the Secretary from \ Bushire could be sent to hold the post for the very brief period of absence involved.5. I attach a draft telegn as this proposal comes ratner out of the blue, it my he preferable to make it private in the first instance. The Imperial Departments are particularly anxious that we should not refer to Koweit oil, as they are very apprehensive of the effect which would be produced were the impression to get abroad through any indiscretion that the Resident's visit to this country was in connection with oil policy in that area. -jj-(/j(£3 1401 5000 11.32 Draft Paper.
