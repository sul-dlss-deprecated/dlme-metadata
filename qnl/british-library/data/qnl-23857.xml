With reference to your D.O.No.157, dated the 18th February, 1941. We have not yet summarised the information obtained through the Census but later in the year I shall produce a full report on the results. number of Indians in Bahrain. We did not attempt to classify them into communities. In most cases ages were not definitely specified but people were classedl as adults or minors. It is the first Census ever taken here and to avoid causing alarm among an ignorant population we refrained from asking for many details which would have been valuable and interesting. When another Census is held it will be possible to obtain many more particulers without causing panic, but this first time we had to trealivery carefully. I will let you know, as soon as I can, the Major R.G-.E.W. Alban, O.B.E Political Agent, Bahrain.D.C.No. M/i &lt;/ Dated the 26th February 1941. I have discuseed the matter of the Education for children of Indians employed in Bahrain with representa tives of the Indian communities. 0 m ^hey are all in favour of having a primary school up to the fourth class, staffed by a male and female teacher from the Indian Educational Department. They feouest that the school should be subjccx. to insoection by the Indian Educational Department. They also request that the tuition should be on the English Public School system and not anglo-vebacular, which they say would be unsuitable for Bahrain. They also reauest that teachers might be only temporarily deputed from India so that in case they are found unsatisfactory, th y can easily be changed, A ^ ^ ^ v ^ A- * Yours sincerely Lieutenant Colonel C.

Sir, As Sardar Abdurrehman Khan has gone on leave I am taking the liberty of addressing you on the subject of the proposed school for Indian children. I have so far been able to contact the gentle men on the enclosed list and from their promises the number of children who can be counted on at present stands at 51. There are several other parents yet to be contacted and in my opinion the number of children can be estimated to be not less than 60. Regarding school premises. When he was here Sardar Abdurrehman Khan had mentioned that he would be moving into a new house, in which case his house ing on the sea road, belong/to Haj Khalil Moayad (the house west of the Bahrain Sports Club) would be a suitable house. The premises of the Bahrain Sports Club is an alternative, but it cannot house teachers. The Bahrain Sports Club is moving into its own premises in three months. A new house is being built to the east of the house of Mr. Vallance, belonging to Haj Mansur Arayad. There are several other houses in the middle of the town, now vacant, and it should be very easy to get one. Obediently, / ;Mr. Jashanmal Dr. D.A. Sitralkar Mr. G.A.

At the present moment the only school catering for Indian children is one run by the Roman Catholic community here and Non Roman Catholic parents stated that they would be glad if a non-denominational school could be opened. 4* To begin with, a primary school is all that would be required and parents insist that the medium of instruction should be English in view of the special conditions prevailing in “^fethrain where firms and especially the Oil Company insist on a good knowledge of English in their employees* 6* In India primary schools are, I believe, taught in the vernacular, and English only becomes a medium of instruction on reaching the Secondary Schools* There seems no reason however against using English as the medium of instruction in Bahrain. 6* A number of parents have signified their readiness to support the scheme and to pay a monthly fee of Rs.2/- per child* The minimum number of children expected to attend is 60 which indicates an income of as*100/- per mensem.7. Two teachers, a man and a woman, would be required in the first instance and these might be provided by the Sind authorities, that province being the closest to Bahrain* is estimated at Rs.1200/- per annum* Other expenses i*e* fbrniture, stationery etc* approximately fis*360/- per annum. sufficient to meet the rent of the building and if the Government of India would agree to assist to the extent of meeting the pay, leave and pension contributions and passage expenses of the two teachers and that part of the rent and miscellaneous charges not covered by fees, it would be possible to get started now and there would be the possibility of meeting more of these charges later on, should attendance increase* 10.

This leaves 53 children of all ages, sexes and religions for the proposed school and it is doubtful if we would get a sufficient attendance to make the school worth mnning. 4. Out of the original 30 parents who agreed to the scheme and to the fees proposed, only 15 have still got their families here. 5.
