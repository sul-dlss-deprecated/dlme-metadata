In view of the Note*at P.Z.5314/33 there seems no objection to basing the rate of income-tax at Aden upon Indian Income-tax Laws, with the addition of such modifications as may be thought necessary. This will presumably cover the point raised by Colonel Reilly in the first paragraph of the portion of his letter which is at P.Z.3608/36. The question whether officers should pay British or Aden income-tax of H.M.G.’s contribution does not appear to be our concern.

As it has been proposed that 1 should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Office and the Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing ohe fourteen points that were then discussed, and adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer uakes place. I enclose a copy of this note. 1 also enclose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as distinct mom the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending a copy of the note and of the draft estimate to the Colonial Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) B.B.Eeilly.

P1 Q »-&gt; L j J | 36 Point 13, Rate of Income Tax , This has been dealt with under Point 1. The question vfoether Officers serving under the Civil and Political Administration should pay British Income Tax depends on the decision with the regard to the framing of the Budget. If all officers are paid from the Aden Budget, and a grant-in-aid received from His Majesty 1 s Government the officers would be liable to Aden Income Tax and. not to British Income Tax. At present the Government of India receive an agreed sum of x.500 from His Majesty’s Govemnent towards income tax on the salaries of Military and Air Force personnel and Political Officers, who are exempted from Indian Income Tax. A similar amount may be expected from His Majesty’s Goverment after the separation. Point 1 . Income Tax . I consider that the present Income Tax rates should be continued, as proposed, under an Aden Ordinance to be made by the new Aden Crown Colony Government. A point for consideration is the levy of the present surcharge on Income Tax and Super Tax which was introduced by the Government of India as an emergency measure in 1931, and which has subsequently been reduced from 25 to 8 1/3 per dent. If this surcharge is to be continued by the Government of India next year, I consider that it should be continued in Aden also, but that its abolition in Aden should be considered when it is abolished in India.i I 5575 Financial Secretary, x—v You may care to see the papers below. In the event of the separation of Aden from India it would of course be for the new colony of Aden to nake its own income tax ordinances or regulations, and it would presumably be open to them to fix the rate of income tax at the rate in force in India from time to time. Political Secretary . Seen, thank you. This seems to overlap, to some extent, P.Z.5302. The question is perhaps not quite so simple as would appear from Colonel Reilly 1 s note or your comment above. The fixing of the rate does not in itself determine the nature and extent of the liability to income-tax,which also depends upon the law in force for the time being as to methods of assessment, income to be taken into account, exemptions and reliefs and many other cognate matters. If | A- ' 3 it■ — it is desired for some reason that Aden should not he differentiated from British India as regards income-tax, the new colony will have to enact the Indian Income-tax Act as it stands and also adopt any future amendments to it. / y- * Uth September 1933 TL~ Uu U W J v** * 7L i £. —Wv. u-&gt; *'f- ■ LAl. UrnP.Z.4599/33 . L etter from Colonel R eil ly to Mr.Laithwaite , Tel: Lymin^rbo ? ! 252 Summerset, Lymingtan, HANTS. 10th August, 1933. Dear Laithwaite, In conversation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some of the point that will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Those that occur to me are:- 13. I consider that the Indian rates of income-tax ought to be continued, and that they ought to apply to officials employed at Aden as well as to the general public, these officials paying their tax to the Aden administration, and not to the British Treasury.(The references in the note below are to the points raised in Colonel Reilly^s demi-official letter of 10th August 1933). % ——— Colonel Reilly^ d.o. letter of 10th August 1933 was discussed at the India Office on 15th August. In addition to Colonel Reilly there were present Mr. Cowell of the Colonial Office, Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office. 13. Rate of Income Tax . This was covered by the note under head (1) above. r The Colonial Office indicated that if and when the salaries ; - of officials at Aden were paid from revenue raised in Aden, ; \ (including any general grant-in-aid from the Treasury) there would be no question of any application of BriLisn income tax to officials. So long, however, as the Treasury providedvany individual salaries, those salaries - would be liable to British Income Tax. It would be desirable, therefore, to arrange the estin&amp;tes Initially so that the salaries of the Resident and all other officials were borne on Aden revenues.*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000010_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1480</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000010</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1480</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 1/44 'Aden.
