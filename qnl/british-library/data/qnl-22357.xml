D.O.No.C/1007 v ^ faM. ^ v-' a office of the Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf. Gamp, Bahrain. Dated the 23rd December, 1942* Dear '#ei^htman, lou v;ill be interested to see the latest copy of 'Al Bahrain* - ou^ illustrated 'Id* edition, Bertram Thomas apologizes for its being printed on green paper, to v/hich i replied that • &lt; ;*k. nothing could be more suitable for the 'id*, but i think he deserves every congratulation for the progress his paper has made • 2. Three-fourths of the space is contributed by his office, but he is in no way responsible for the remainder although he tries to exclude unsuitable material. Kecently the editor gave him a long article upon 'Carriage' which he was very anxious to put in. it was found, however, that it contained a lofty dissertation upon its hygienic aspects and urged that persons should only select their mates from untainted stock and have nothing to do with the diseased or the feeble minded. As this would have prevented the greater part of the Ruling -Pamily from contemplating matrimony and might make the paper unpopular, Bertram Thomas reluctantly felt compelled to cut out this contribution. More recently the editor accepted a contribution from a Mullah in ^atif urging that something should be done for education there, xhis article got in v /ithout Bertram Thomas , notice and he tells me that the Mullah has been, as might have been expected, summoned to Kiyadh to explain his views more fully.

Wakefield, Esq., I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. •I \ 11 ft &gt;Translation AN APPEAL TO FOUND AN INSTITUTE AT QATIF By making this speech I wish to draw the attention of those who have clear ralnds and sound brains. If vrtiat I call for Is right you can act on It. Listen to me. If this ray appeal Is right you should not go behind it, but if it is not so I am to be blamed for It. I depend on God in whom I am putting my confidence, I v/as certain that my fellow countrymen will respond to the call of a person if it is intended for their own welfare. Our ancestors, whom God may forgive, did not found an educa tional school although they were spending large sums of money in the way of philanthropy. Unfortunately their sons followed their example because there has been no-one to launch an appeal for the carrying out of a project like this which is so import ant that one or even ten men would not be able to carry it out. You should know that the reason for putting up this appeal is that His Holiness Shaikh Mansur A1 Marhoon srid in his speech of the night of 28th Ramadhan, when he mentioned the question of philanthropic acts - schools being one of them - that our twon Qatif has not yet received such a favour. Can't you found a school, even In huts, for students to go and learn? As soon as the Shaikh finished his speech a number of the youth came to me sighing with grief and groaning sorely directing all their questions to me thinking that I was the right person to handle such a matter. How could I comply with their request and my condition Is weak and my health getting worse? I put them off by explaining to them the condition of the public in general. Next night I came to them with this my word (appeal) v/hich I delivered before an audience consisting of 1500 men. It was met with approval and had a far-reaching effect which will come to light after the reply of our respected Ulemas to whom God may give a long life. I put it before them on the tenth day of Shawal in the Majlis of Hujjat al Islam Sayld Majid al •Awwaml so that they should discuss it fully. If they consider /itit right they can better take it up but if, on the other hanJV they find it not right they can neglect it. It is as follows: All of you are aware that your country Qatif is far from the centres of education such as Najaf, Karbalai Kadhimain and Samurra in Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Iran, India and other Arab and non-Arab countries. In Egypt there is the A1 Azhar Univer sity. This University, at a certain time, had 12,000 students and is still existing for educational and religious studies. Therefore, it is not out of Justice to leave your kind father land without an institute which your children can attend to increase their knowledge and learn something about their religion and enlighten their minds although, thank God, your country Qatif has a number of efficient Ulemas who can well carry out all that other Ulemas in the foreign countries can do. This in addition to a number of highly educated persons who are about to reach the degree of 'Mujtahids 1 as well as a large number of other educated persons. 0 Gentlemen, Shaikhs, rny fellow countrymen! Don't you like that your country, like other countries, should be the abode of persons of sound mind and seekers of education? Doesn't this bring you good reputation? The establishment of a school in Qatif brings .life to it, makes its name high after it had been negligible as if it were not in existence. Wash out this dirt by founding a school which will lift your sons high to the top after they have been down in the bottom in the grips of old traditions. Don't you like that your sons should attain high ranks and get rid of ignorance? Do you know that when a foreigner enters a country he asks about its schools, libraries, clubs and meeting places? He leaves it with the impression of either criticism or praise. Our country Qatif, thank God, lacks all these and any foreigner who leaves it will criticise it. Do you agree to this? Nay, no-one who loves his country agrees to this. All what I mentioned is a preliminary step intended to solve the problem and to give you courage and arouse your Arab zeal.My appeal for the establishment of a school is not hard for anyone of you and Is nothing but a small matter as any amount spent for this purpose, however big it may be, is small compared with the importance of a project like this. Ai e the people of Qatlf unable to contribute an amount suffi cient for a school which will be of everlasting benefit to them as long as history exists? I and whoever who had heard of it have to thank the people of Bahrain who collected thousands (of rupees) lor their poor during the time I was there. There are in Bahrain many meeting places, clubs, Husainiyahs and Muharram processions which the pen and tongue fail to describe. There is an interesting story of the results of meetings. I w&lt;us sitting with the students before our teacher during our lessons in the compound of the school of Al Kashif al Ghita (at Najaf) at the time I was there. A Muai'di came in with a lo^rge document asking about the Shaikh who was then at Kufa. The teacher asked him what he 7/anted. He replied saying he wanted the Shuikh to sign the paper which was about a •waqf Husainiyah (piourning place) built by them in their town. He asked him how much it cost them. He said 700 Iraqi Dinars, which is equal to 10,000 Saudi Riyals. We inquired about their town and came to know that it was a small town called 'Ifaj situated on the bank of the Eupherates. This is only a small example of what lias been happening. I would be lengthening the subject if I were to mention Khan al Hunood at Najaf and other things which were done by philanthropists. You my brethren who like to do good and desire the existence and expansion of such a project? Do not listen to the statements of silly persons who might say that Qatif is not suitable for a school. You know that it is impossible to please everyone. You know that good ideals, efforts and Ulemas follow the course of events in the world; they do not get disappointed whenever they fail in their efforts. They make effort after eifort even if they fail each time. Time changes and history repeats events; once good luck comes and another time bad luck. A ridn who comes up with a good idea will continue to spread it /andand find supporters with undaunted courage and firmness, un shaken by fears and unaffected by sentiments. You are requested to help in bringing this project into existence and expanding it according to your ability. You know that one or ten men cannot undertake such an important task however financially well they may be. If you help you will acquire a good reputation, get blessings, win everlasting gratitude and good reward as there will be in your country a school for your children. It will be as their merciful mother. They willb e one hand against anyone who may oppose them. It 1 will save them the trouble of going abroad. Thay will be as one religious body ordering good acts and forbidding bad acts, leading to the good and to the right path. Qatif. Ali al Shaikh Mansur al Marhoon al Qatifi.h Confidential . D.O.

February 2, 1943. sC*. y S With reterenper^to your Demi-official letter No. C/129 dated the 29th January, 1943, I am extremely sorry that the article in question should have caused displeasure to Ibn Saud. I have given orders that any reference to Saudi Arabia must be submitted to me in future. His Highness and Shaikh Abdulla read the article again. In their opinion there was nothing in it that appeared likely to upset Ibn Saud. His Highness reminded me that complimentary articles praising the Saudi regime were constantly published in A1 Bahrain. The Shaikhs did not think that the Editor deserved condemnation for publish ing the article but at the same time I have warned him to be more careful. ■■ S. B. Wakefield, Esquire, I.C.S., H. B.

When met with in the paper the author is the editor-owner himself. He appears always to have ♦ used the style in question. The status of the paper appears to be that of a privately-owned Bahrain one and although this office 1 &gt; provides it with a great deal of copy for which it pays^Al Bahrain is not regarded as a British-controlled Daper. The Political Resident had occasion to point this out some months ago to H.B.M's Minister in Jedda in connection with an article which concerned Ibn Saud. The paper is in fact censored by the Bahrain Government before publication each week and hitherto the style in question has passed the censor. It would therefpre seem likely that if the change proposed is made, the personages in question may feel that they have lost face with the authority instituting the change,or^will do so with the readers of the paper. I merely mention these points in case you think them worth considering. As the editor•owner is a Bahrain!, Belgrave is the right person perhaps to do it through.

As far as the Bahrain Government are concerned, the position is that a proof copy of each issue of the ''Al Bah rain' is sent to the Adviserate for scrutiry before publica tion, but Mr. Belgrave reiaerabers nothing about the article in question, so it sounds as though his 'censorship' of the paper is not very thorough.
