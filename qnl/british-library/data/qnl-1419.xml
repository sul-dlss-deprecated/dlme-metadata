From, The Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. To, The Commissioner in Sind, Kurrachee. ^Political Superintendent's Office, Jacohabad, Ath August 1870. When I arrived on this Frontier in 18G8, one of the first official orders of Government that was brought to my notice was one inculcating unity and friendly official intercourse with the Punjaub border officers, whose districts from the neighbourhood of Kusmore to Hurrund Dajel, &amp;c. are coterminous with ours. 2. T have done all in my power to obey T those orders, and I believe with advantage to the public service ; the state of the Frontier generally, including Cutchee itself, being much more quiet now than when I first arrived. 3. In the accompanying letter, however, from Captain Harrison, No. 42 of 1870, dated 22nd ultimo, which followed the intercepted correspondence just despatched to you with my letter No. 1125, dated 30th ultimo, the 3 first pa ras contain expressions regarding Captain Sandeman similar to those used by the Khan in his letter to your address, excepting that the charge regarding the Poolajee raid is omitted, and the visit to Kahun, which in May was reported as having been alluded to in a casual way, is now expressed as having been attended with ' dissatisfaction' and ' feelings of irritation' on His HiiHiness' o o part. 4. I will only say that I hope the Government will soon put a stop to this very unbecoming and dangerous sort of agitation which is being indulged in by both the Khan and the British Agent at his Court, as it cannot fail to be attended by highly detrimental results to the public service. 5. In paras. 4, 5, G and 7, Captain Harrison seems to be devoting himself, in a still more objectionable way, to attacking the Ameer of Caubool, and as the Khan must be aware of his sentiments, it is impossible to foresee the mis chief that may result from this infatuated conduct. S ir,G. In connection with this antagonism towards the Ameer of Caubool, which appears to have sprung up at Khelat, since the outlawed Sirdars went to appeal to the Ameer a few months since, Ihave the honor to forward Cap tain Harrison's Diary from the 4th to 10th July last, and beg to draw atten tion to the entry under Friday, 7th July, giving Seistan information obtained by Zuggur Munghul Sirdar. 7. The Khan, who was asked by me in 1869 to obtain general informa tion regarding Persian aggression in Seistan, appears from this Diary to have commenced a correspondence with Sirdar Ibrahim Khan of Chagkansoor, who, it will be seen in reply, states that he and others were at one time subjects of Khelat, and that as soon as the Persians heard this, they went away. Ibra him Khan further solicits Khelat aid against the Persians, and good offices on his behalf with the English Government. 8. Coupling all this with the animus recently shown at Khelat against the Ameer of Caubool, and feeling assured that unless it is put a stop to, some complication will arise, I have addressed the accompanying letter No. 112G, of this date, to Captain Harrison on the subject. 9. Keverting now to Captain Harrison's letter under report, T observe that in paras. 8 to 12 he recapitulates much of what has been already before Government. In para. 12, however, I object to his throwing on Sirdar Noor- deen the onus of ' re-opening the whole question by an agressive act against t: a villao-e of His Highness's,' because Noordeen would not have acted as he O ® did, but for Captain Harrison's original interference between the Jam of Bevla and the Khan regarding this village. If requisite, the whole of the circumstances can be given in detail ; in fact, the result of that affair verified what was anticipated in the Government of India's letter No. 1194, dated 26th August 1869, quoted in para. 5 of Captain Harrison's letter now forwarded. 10. It is not unworthy of note that in the letter under reply Captain Harri son styles the Khan as ' the Khan of Beloochistan'. I do not know whether any particular meaning is attached to this assumption of title or not. I never heard of it before, and it is submitted that the Political Agent should bo required to confine himself to the usual designation ' Khan of Khelat.'' I have, &amp;c., Pi. PHAYRE, Colonel, Political Superintendent, Upper Sind Frontier.No. 42 of 1870. From, To, The Political Agent, Khelat. The Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. Khelat, 22nd Ji/^1870. Having forwarded a letter from His Highness the Khan of Beloochistan with accompaniments, it occurs to me that it may be desirable that I should place on record the probable results that may be anticipated from the indirect interference that appears to be going on in Beloochistan ; there are also certain allusions to myself in Sirdar Moolah Mahomed's letter that require refutation. 2. The present complications appear to have arisen indirectly through the Deputy Commissioner of Dhera Gazee Khan's connection with the No.2001, Of 12thDecember 1868, Murrees ;what this Officers relations are with to the Political Superintendent Fron- this tribe, and how thev occurred, are detailed tier Upper Sind. • , - , , . J „ in his letter marginally noted. When Sir Henry Green gave his sanction to these arrangements, I was his Assistant, and cer tainly understood that the Deputy Commissioner's connection with this tribe was limited, and that his interference would only be such as would ensure peace and quiet in his own district; that this was Sir Henry Greens' policy may be understood from the 6th para, of letter herewith quoted :— ' In a demi-official letter to Sir Henry Green, I explained to him fully '' my scheme for the better political management of the Punjab border, ' and he replied that he approved generally of it, and thought that it would ' succeed (time has shewn that it has proved a marked success), and fur ther, in reply to an observation of mine, that it might interfere with Khelat ' affairs, he answered, 4 never mind the Khan of Khelat's affairs, I will look ' after them.' I hLve this letter and others to the same purport now with me.' This scheme was extended by permission of the Government, and Cap tain Sandeman received their thanks. Up to the present time I have not heard that the Deputy Commissioner of Dhera Ghazee Khan has political powers in Beloochistan, and his assumption of these duties directly and in directly are calculated to do a great deal of mischief.3. Soon after reaching Khelat this year, His ITighness wished to know what object Captain Sandeman had in goin^ to Kahun, and I could see from his manner and frequent allusions to the Murrees and Bhoogtees, that he was dissatisfied. His confidence however in the English Government would have enabled him to overcome this feeling of irritation, had it not been for the circumstances which led him to communicate the interference of a British Officer to the Commissioner in Sind. lv In my report No&gt; 24, of the 29th June, 1 mentioned that His High ness wished to know if the English Government were likely to attend to Ameer Shere Ali Khan s request, regarding Sirdars Moolah Mahomed and Azad Khan, and that I replied it was very improbable. 1 had several reasons for making this statement. 5 # i s t The very clear policy defined by the Government of India and „ the Government of Bombay, viz : that a British From Secretary to Government of _ * India No. 1194s dated 2Hth August 1869. Political Agent, who becomes an arbiter as Government Resolution by Bora- . i u* i» i a • bay Government No. 3039, dated 2ist between a 1 oreign Prince and his leudatories, September i8(J9. incurs a very great risk of entangling himself and his Government in dangerous compKcatiows, and that the Political Agent at Khelat should be careful to avoid placing himself in such a position. 6. 2nd—That the policy defined by the Commissioner in Bind in his letter 266 of 1809, para 4, was approved of by From Secretary to Government of ^ Government of India, as per letter mar- India, No. 951, Political Department. U11U VJUVCli-i 5 i ginally noted. 7. 3 rc l A letter from the Secretary to the Government of India No. 1996 of 1860, dated 13th August, to the Secretary of the Punjaub, defines the position of Azad Khan with the Government of Beloochistan, and requests the Ameer of Affgbanistan to give instructions to his Officers not to interfere with the Khan and his rebellious subjects. 8. 4th My personal experience of these Sirdars and what they are capable of doing. Last year I was directed to meet the discontented Chiefs at Bhagwanah. I detailed to a great extent how they had behaved, in my letter No. 10 of the 10th June 1869, but one or two circumstances I only reported demi-ofiicially, not wishing to make the Government unnecessarily anxious on my account- I should never have alluded to them again had I not heard that indirect interference with my duties was going on, and that 1 considered it advisable that Government should have every information regarding the character of the Sirdars whose cause is being advocated. Ihe full danger of my meeting these Sirdars was only apparent when they had entrenched themselves within a few miles of Khelat. Had a fight taken place, and anything happened to His Highness, the English Government would have been responsible. Feeling this, I had to insist that as they had come byinvitation, no hostilities could occur, and if fighting took place, I should con sider the attack made on myself. 9. The Sirdars in exile are pleasant well spoken men, but treacherous to a degree, as the following instances will show. On going to Cupota at their special request, I was fired at by the Raisanees, but kept so well away from the position they occupied, that no evil consequences resulted. Sirdars Moolah Mahomed, Azad Khan Noordeen, and Mahomed Khan Roostumzai advocated siezing me and making a rush on Khelat, and that if they failed in this attempt, to seek safety in Persian territory. Had I not taken precautions, they might have effected their purpose. 10. Should however any further illustration be necessary, the case of Sirdais .Adla Deena J\.oorQ. and TV uderah Adum Khan may be remarked upon. In June last His Highness gave them a free pardon, and all their lands and estates, stipulating that if they behaved well, lie would acknowledge them as Sirdars of their respective tribes; they agreed to this, but proceeded direct to Seebee, and gave the most frivolous reasons for so doing. A week or ten days ago they came here. His Highness gave them a cordial reception, but was doubtful as to the honesty of their intentions, and therefore whilst giving them all their lands and posses sions, still kept their rank in abeyance : they asseveated that Sirdar Moolah Mahomed and the other Chiefs were their deadliest enemies, and that they had no confidence in any one but His Highness. Letters found on Wuzeer Khan proved that they had been in correspondence with those Chiefs up to a very recent date. His Highness informed them of this fact, and sug gested that it would be to their advantage to refute having written these letters, at the same time that he did not wish to press the point, and that whatever the result might be, he would not depart from previous arrange ments ; these Sirdars did not care about any enquiry being made regarding this matter, and having made their salaam to His Highness, took possession of their lands. The next thing heard of them was that they had informed the Sara wan people, that Captain Sandeman was coming into the plains this cold season, and that half of Cutchee was to be given to Sirdar Moolah Mahomed, and the other half to the Khan. 11. The preceding eight paras, will I trust show that I understand what the Government policy is as regards Beloochistan , the danger of in- terterence, and that no course of the kind is likely to be encouraged, whether advocated by Ameer Shere Ali Khan, or any British officer. 12. It is well known that for the past fourteen years it has been one continued struggle for supremacy between the Khan and the Sirdars now in exile. Last year they were unanimous in wishW to test their strength ^ O O against their sovereign, and to abide the consequences. Sirdar Noordeen re-opened the whole question by an aggressive act against a village of HisHtghness, and when a force was sent to punish him, moat of his confederates joined, with what result is well known to Government. 13. Having alluded to the Sirdars, it is due to His Highness to men tion the state of the country, and the arrangements made since he has freed himself from the intrigues of these Sirdars. For the past eight months there has been perfect queit in Beloochistan, people of small and great degree are contented, I am therefore convinced that what Sir Henry Green said is cor rect, viz : that the feeling of the people is not always in accord with the Chiefs. His Highness has availed himself of this opportunity, and is doing his best to consolidate his power. Arrangements have been made for the better transit of Kafilas, aid given to the inhabitants of Cutchee, by a detachment of regular troops and posts of irregular cavalry. A trustworthy man with ten- sowars has just started for the Choota country, and has received most clear instructions not only to look after His Highness' interests, but to afford every possible aid and assistance to the English Government, as regards the appre hension of criminals who have sought protection in Khelat territory. 14. The Khan has lately paid a great deal of attention to revenue mat ters, having been obliged to neglect this part of his administration, owing to constant rebellions. Enquiry showed that his interests had been neg lected, and a system had crept in, by which his executives looked upon all fines as their perquisites. As this must have oppressed the poorer classes more or less. His Highness issued a circular to his Naibs, stating that though acquainted with what had passed, no notice would be taken, as he had proba bly allowed them too much latitude in their proceedings ; from the 11th July however they were to be satisfied with the pay and emoluments he had sanctioned, that all receipts and disbursements were to be carefully recorded, and any divergence from these instructions would be severely punished. 15. Two circumstances that I have noticed may give a fair idea of the quiet now existing in Beloochistan :— 1st.—We have been here nine weeks, people rarely or ever go about armed, and Dr. Bowman has not had a single case to treat resulting from personal violence. 2nd.—People can apparently travel in safety from Seebee to Khelat Without the slightest fear. Sirdar Ala Deenah's son and brother first ar rived, and were followed by their relatives, and one or two servants. 1G. All these facts taken into consideration show a marked improvement, as also that His Highness perfectly understands what is expected of him, as sovereign of the country, and is doing his utmost to consolidate his Govern ment. 17. Sirdar Moolah Mahomed alludes to a letter of mine ; it is simplypass, saying that I guaranteed they would not be injured by His Highness on their road from Cupota, copy of this document is in my office. 18. Having acted according to my instructions, I beg most respectfully to solicit the protection of Government against interference with duties that they have entrusted to me. I have, &amp;c., C. W.

Tuesday —Visited His Highness, and met all the principal men of the Mingul tribe. His Highness informed them that in consequence of their repre sentations, he should make Meah Khan their Sirdar. • Wednesday —Sirdar Ala Deenah Koord's brother, Kadur Deenah, and his son, Yar Mahomed, came to report Sirdar Adum Khan's and Sirdar Alia Deenah's arrival at Murrow to His Highness ; they visitedjne in the after noon, and stated that a few days before leaving Seebee, Shahan Murree had arrived with a letter from Captain Sandeman for Sirdar Moolah Mahomed, which had been taken at once to Kandahar by that Chiefs Vakeel. Thursday —Reported to the Political Superintendent Frontier Upper Sind in my letter Xo. 36, of today s date, statements made by Sirdar Alia Deenah Koord's relations. Friday —His Highness placed at my disposal information from Siestan obtained by Abdool Rehman Khan, the Zuggur Mingul Sirdar :— / y roni Sirdar Abdool Rehman Khan* to His Highness the Khan of Khelat, '• Agreeably to your wishes, I sent a kossid to Sirdars Ibrahim Khan and Meer Mahomed. He remained fifteen days at Siestan, and has returned with * Sirdar of Nooshky, on the N. W. border of Beloochistau. W. L. M.several letters, and a roui^ti sketch of the neighbourhood, showing' the country held by the Belooch, before the Gujjurs commenced their system of annexa tion ; they particularly asked me to state that if your Highness would assist them, that they could resist encroachments of the Persians.' Letter from Sirdar Ibrahim Khan to His Highness* ' We are Sungranees, Tokees, anil have always considered ourselves as your subjects, any duty you may assign to us will be cheerfully performed. The state of this part of the country is as follows r— About six years ago the various Sirdars began quarrelling amongst themselves, and on this, account, the Gujjurs got a footing in our country. In former days we had thirty forts on the Helmund, but most of them have now fallen into the hands, of the Persians* The Gujjurs have detachments in th^ forts of Nadalee, and Boorjass on the off-side of the Helmund, these forts formerly belonged to us ; for the last six years it has been a constant fight, the Gnjjurs without just cause march ing forces against the Belooch, and opposed by us in every possible way. Six months ago they marched on Chuckansoor, and having thrown up smigars, or temporary field works, called upon us to acknowledge ourselves the subjects of the Shah of Persia ; further, that they intended to build a fort, and keep a force there. We replied that we were Belooch, and subjects of your High ness, and would make no concessions ; upon hearing this, they went away. We are hopeful now that your Highness knows the position that we are in, that you will either aid us, or ask the English Government to do so ; if you will act in the matter, w r e shall be saved,, and your name will be great. I intend sending Abdool Hehman Khan and Furaz Khan to visit you, and any statements made by them may be relied upon. We are annoyed night and day by these Persians ; a few days ago, at the instigation of the Khanee Sirdar, 500 camel sowars came from Seistan and carried off 70 flocks of sheep and goats, five Belooch were killed. I at once sent my nephew, Abdool Eehman Khan, to Ahmed Khan, the Governor of Furrah. Having got aid from him, he followed these plunderers, and killed 150 of their number, amongst the killed, ten were men of rank and influence. Ten days ago a Persian, Momak Jurkee, fired at a Belooch, and killed him ; we retaliated. This style of petty warfare is incessant; if you will assist us, every thing will go on well.' Letter from Sirdar Ibrahim Khan to Sirdar Abdool Rehman Khan\ Zuggur MinguL ' Is merely a repetition of the letter to His Highness. He asks the Nooshky Sirdar, as a Belooch, and one who acknowledges the same rule as himself, to see if His Highness can ard them in any way in recovering the fol lowing places:—Jelhilabad, forts of Goonah, Markood, Wugee Ibrahimabad, Koodmy, Aliabad, Zemideen, Tiflak, Boseabad, Khajee Ahmed, Jeliangeer, Jehanabad, Del\ Balat, Nadalee Akakhan and Boorj Afs. Ibrahim Khan alscvstates that the Khanee Sirdar Meer All Khan had gone to his own country ; that the detachments in the forts of Nadaleo and Boorjas were so small, that if assisted by His Highness, they could easily turn them out, also that at Allaabad in Seistan, there was only a small foree with two or three guns. The writer also states that although Sirdar Shanee Khan, Belooch, had succumbed to the Persians, he would be sure to rejoin them, if any active measures were taken against the Gujjurs. Sirdar Meah Mahomed's letter to His Highness is merely a summary of what Ibrahim Khan had written ; he mentions that there are two thousand Gujjurs in eight forts^ and that they have five guns, lie does not state where the said forts are. The Khanee Sirdar he mentions as being at Beerjund. Visited by His Highness as usual. Saturday. —His Highness presented all the principal men of the Minguls with Kiluts, and appointed Me ah Mahomed their Sirdar. As His Highness' arrangements may be of interest to the Government, a report on the subject will be forwarded in the course of a few days to the Political Superintendent Frontier Upper Sind. Sunday —Sirdar Ala Deenah and Wnderah Adum Khan arrived, and are to have an interview with His Highness tomorrow. Quiet in Beloochistan during the past week. C. W.
