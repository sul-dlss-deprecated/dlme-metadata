It might be true, but on the other hand the Persian Govern ment may either wish to warn the American and British Governments that some Soviet move of this nature may take place, or they may v/ish to give support to their requests for arms.

A third violation of the indicated agree ment was the fact that the Persian Government not only did not submit for the confirmation of the Majlis the treaty, provided for by the agreement, concerning the formation or a joint Soviet-Persian oil Company but als&gt; spoke against the conclusion of such a treaty in the Majlis. In this manner, the Persian Government breaking its word violated the obligations which it had taken upon itself. The Soviet Government also cannot pass by the fact that the decision of the Majlis concerning the decision of the agreement about the formation of a joint Soviet-Persian oil Company for Northern Persia, under the condition of the preservation of the British oil concession in Southern Persia is an act of gross discriioination with regard to the U.S.S.R. On the basis of the above exposition the Soviet Government expresses a firm protest against the indicated hostile actions of the Persian Govern ment with regard to the Soviet Union, actions in compatible with normal relations between the two states, and^charges the Government of Persia with responsibility for the consequences of this ' [Ends]./'•N, •&lt;* K EXT En Clair GENERAL DISTRIBUTION FROII MOSCO.'. f TO FOREIGN OFFICE Sir M.

Repeated to VTashington No. 12108 Moscow No.879 Saving British Middle East Office Cairo No.247 Saving IMPORTANT SECRE T Your telegram No.1179 [of 13th November: Political situation in Persia], The question of the comment which you might make on the Shah’s constitutional schemes is clearly a very difficult one. If His Majesty’s Government give advice which can be construed as favouring the Shah's desire to increase his own power, they are liable to be accused of wishing to turn the present Shah into a despot like his father. If His Majesty’s Government give advice suggesting that no constitutional reform on the lines suggested by the Shah is desirable they give the Shah and his party the opportunity to make out that their interest in Persian reform is not genuine and that when any proposal v/hich might promote progress is put forward, it is they who block it. 2. Nevertheless I am impressed with the dangers of the situation which may arise if the Shah embarks lightheartedly on a plan involving a change, in the constitution. It seems unlikely that any such plan would fail to arouse strong opposition. The result would at the least be a constitutional wrangle v/hich would impair the effectiveness of the Government and v/culd give subversive elements an excellent opportunity to cause trouble. At the worst it might, as you suggest, lead tc the suspension of the constitution. There seems also the possibility that it might in the end provoke a movement for the removal of the Shah himself. At present the prime need of Persia seems tc be stability of Government. I therefore think, subject tc your views, that if it is necessary for you tc say anything definite tc the Shah, you should tell him that while His Majesty’s Government do not consider that they can properly advise as tc whether or not he should carry cut any scheme of constitutional change they are impressed withthe danger tc the stability of Persia which the attempt tc introduce such change might cause. Their advice v/culd therefore be that he should weigh very carefully the consequences before^ . f initiating any action tc change the constitution. His Majesty^ Government are entirely convinced that it is essential fcr Persia s future that reform and*development should take place rapidly, but they are not convinced that in order tc do this it is necessary first tc tamper with the Constitution and thereby open up possibilities of acrimonious discussion which might in the end merely sidetrack concrete proposals fcr reform.Bm— VrTr“^* - 2 - 3.

Cairo LIGHT SECRET Your telegram No. 819^ The Prime Minister gave me this morning a full account of events both prior to and since the passage cf this resolution by the Majlis. The only new development is that, in response to a somewhat peremptory request, the Soviet Ambassador has now been given a reply to his last written communication on the subject of pressing for the signature of agreement before its submission to Majlis. The Persian note I understand was simply a formal communi cation of the text of the Majlis resolution. 2. When the Prime Minister had finished his accounts of these events, I spoke to him in the sense indicated in paragraph 3 cf your telegram under reference. His reply was to the effect that the resolution was not a Government measure and he had not been a party to the drafting of it. Moreover he had been definitely opposed to the accelerated procedure adopted. It was therefore impossible for him to explain the intentions which lay behind any particular passage. He felt sure however that the Mailis did not intend to initiate any radical revision of Anglc-Persian concession. On the other hand they might conceivably wish at some stage to invite the Company^ help in securing still closer economic and social co-operation. He offered to make enquiries but I said that I did net think this would serve any useful purpose and v/ith this he readily agreed. He undertook however to keep me fully informed if he had any reason to believe’that a proposal of the kind he had indicated seemed likely to take shape. My impression is that the Prime Minister has* no wish to raise this question, but that he does not yet knov/ whether he will be able to resist pressure for a revision cf certain clauses of the concession which may be brought to bear on him by some of his opponents.

The resolution has been discussed with His Majesty’s Ambassador. 2. Although clause (e), taken in conjunction with clause (c), could be interpreted as meaning that the Persian Government ought to take steps to revise or cancel the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company* s concession, it seems more likely that this is not the intention behind the insertion of clause (e) in the resolution. This seems rather to be simply a tactical move designed to forestall Russian charges that the Persians are pursuing a ’’one-sided policy”. 3. On this assumption formal representations by us to the Persian Government would be undesirable. They could in any case not give us any more security than we already have in the terms of the concession. Moreover, they would at this stage almost certainly be misunderstood and misrepresented. All that seems necessary is to secure from the Persian Prime Minister an assurance that he does not in fact contemplate any action against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s concession. Accordingly His Majesty’s Ambassador on his return will take the opportunity,-in conversation with Qawam, to tell him that this clause had raised a little doubt in London as to the intentions of the Persian Government, but that I assume that the Persian Government have in fact no intention of asking for a revision of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company* s concession; and he will ask the Prime Minister to authorise him to. assure the authorities in London that this assumption is correct. rrrrrrmu / CrC 2 ^ / 3 V En Clair L3INET DISTRIBUTION FROM MOSCOW TO FOREIGN OFFICE.

(A) Whereas the Prime Minister in good faith and as a result of an interpretation of the meaning of the second article of the law of December 2nd 194L, undertook discussions for the drawing up of the agreement dated April Lth 19L6, regarding the creation of a mixed Persio-Soviet Oil Company; and where [sic] the Persian Majlis do not regard this interpretation as being consistent with the real purport and meaning of the aforementioned law, they consider the above discussions and agreement to be with out effect and null and void* The third paragraph of the communique of the Lth April 191-6 is also null and void. (B) The Government shall make arrangements for a technical and scientific survey with a view to the discovery of oil deposits and shall within a period of 5 years, draw and prepare complete technical and scientific maps of the oil bearing areas of the country so that the Majlis shall be able, with full knowledge and information of the exist ence of oil in sufficient quantities, to make arrangements for the commercial exploitation of this national wealth by passing the necessary laws. (C) The grant of any kind of concession to foreigners for the extraction of the oil and its by-products of the country and the creation of any kind of company for this purpose in which foreigners are in any manner shareholders, is absolutely forbidden.

R 90th October, 1947 My despatch No.588, paragraph 4# United States policy about the Soviet-Persian oil agreement. Since the United States Ambassador’s statement on September 11th, there have been various attempts made here to misconstrue the motives of United States interest in the North Persian oil question. This was made all the easier in that the Persian Director of Propaganda, in his broadcast talk on September 28th, reported in my telegram No. 29 Saving, was careless enough to use various phrases which suggested that United States Government wished to obtain some concession in North Persia from American oil interests. 2. The American Ambassador has been at great pains to remove any basis for such misunderstandings and the Persian Director of Propaganda has, at his request, issued various corrective statements. The latest of these, made at a press conference on October 13th, defined United States policy as follows ”1. Since the accession to power of the present Prime minister, M. Qavam, the Americans have put forward no request in any form whatever for the exploitation of oil resources. 2. The official representatives of the United States have several times stated that the United States Government would not be opposed to Persir granting facilities to foreigners for the exploitation of Persian Oil. 5. The United States arc nevertheless opposed to the exercise of any form of pressure on the part of a f reign power in order to obtain these facilities for the exploitation of all ,, .4 l *4 &lt;' * I % | [This telegrcm is of particulrr secrecy and should he retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on].

IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL My telegram No. 1039. Soviet-Pcrsinn Oil Agreement. Conjecture is rife about the contents of the Prime Mini c ter l s report and the form of its presentation on October 19th. Qav£m has hitherto refused to be drawn even by enquiries from his supporters in Majlis, and it is not yet known whether the Chamber will meet in public session or in camera and whether the report will be a general one or limited to the oil question. 2. Tudeh newspaper 'Razm 11 points out that submission of the report without recommendations is not in accord with undertaking in Sadtchikov-Qavam letters, which was to submit a draft bill; and it regards the present proposal as a manoeuvre by Qavam to avoid a defeat in the Chamber. 3. Majlis opposition also is taking the line xhaj; a ’'report' is inadequate and that the Government should associate itself either with acceptance or rejection of the letters. 4. United States Ambassador’s sudden departure for a four day visit to Angora, which will coincide with Majlis meeting on October 19th has also given rise to conjecture. The 'Journale de Tehran” contrasted this week-end trip with the absence of His Majesty's Ambassador until November and draws the conclusion that the United States Government arc more closely preoccupied with the oil question than His Majesty's Government who 'are not, in fact, intervening in the question, although reports to the effect that they ’would be in favour in the event of pressing danger to Persia of a friendly agreement, seems to correspond with British policy on this issue”. 5. Though there have been rumours to this effect, there is no evidence whatever that the Soviet Embassy are prepared to contemplate anything else than the terms of the 1946 exchange of letters, for submission of which to the Majlis they continue to press. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs have no knowledge of any readiness on the Russian side to contemplate a compromise.

Two column Pravda article on 9th on n The Expansionist Policy of the United States in Persia' argues-that. increased American activity in Persia aims at turning the country into an instrument of their policy, the joint committees 'strategical study' having concluded &gt; that it would be profitable for American^imperialist circles to take over control of Persia in the guise of various kinds of aid. 2. Article deals critically with Milspaugh’s record. General Schwarzkopf's control of the gendarmerie, General Grow's reorganisation of the army, plans for economic aid envisaging the construction of strategic bases, the negotiations for a credit of 250 million dollars, and continues that the Americans may only grant financial help on condition that the Persian Government puts an end to 'democratic organisations' that the majority in the Mejlis is composed of people enjoying the United States confidence, and that the expenditure of the loan is agreed with an American Mission. 3. Article alleges that the American aim is to induce the Persian Government and Mejlis to renounce 'The agreement concluded with the Soviet Government' for the setting up of the joint company, since this company would strengthen Soviet-Persian relations, make Persia independent of United States financial aid and leave the way clear for a 'Persian' oil company controlled by the 'Americans themselves.

Some papers October 9th carry, under heading 'Mejlis deputy Masudi speaks with an American crib’, short message from Pravda's Tehran correspondent reporting Masudi's speech attacking the British concession. Message alleges that this attack was meant to disguise the main purpose of his speech, which was the introduction of a proposal to remdiate the Soviet-PQrsian agreement 'which, as is known, is different in principle in the profitable nature cf its terms for Persia from the terms of the Rritish oil concessioh'.u u u u u ( 2 ) 6. Regarding Masudi's proposal to set up an all-Persian corporation, message claims that in the opinion of Tehran business ana other circles, the Persians are not in a position to extract the oil by themselves either from fhe financial or teahnical aspect.

Soviet-Persian Oil Agreement. •I learn that before the Priaie Minister's report is debated in the Chamber it will be 1 referred (probably on October 19th) to a coxiaission of Majlis who will be asked for their recommendations. 2. Prime Minister intends to give a directive to Democrat members of this commission. The existence of this directive will be kept secret. I understand from Hr. Nikpay thr t directive will suggest that commission 1 should examine two possible proposals. (a) A modification of the original Qavam-Sadtchikov formula for a joint Soviet-Persian company in order to limit opportunities of Soviet infiltration. This new proposal which is expected to be rejected by Russians (who would thus assume responsibility for rupture'of negotiations) 'would stipulate that the Persian Covernxnt would themselves prospect territory in North Persia to determine in what places oil is present in commercially exploitable quantities, and that joint company (which would have a Persian majority share holding), would then exploit it using Persian personnel and imposing restrictions on Russian participation, and would deliver the oil produced to Russia.(This is substantially the same proposal as that described in Tehran telegram No.855 and in Ambassador's top secret letter of July 24th to Wright). (b) Formation of s Persian National Oil Company (see my telegram No. 29 Saving) which would deliver to buyers oil produced from general area covered by Qavam-Sadtchikov letxers.- 2 - yv (a) is 'both disingenious and likely to prove doable edged, as in present ciroaiistances it is 'iiach more likely that the Majlis&gt; will reject it oat of hand than that they will pass it through so hedged about with M safeguard n as to ensure rejection by Russians. (b) Seems to me much safer as it would remove any grievance that Russia was being refused the possibility of Majlis accepting it and therefore allowing negotiations of some kind to continue. 4. United States Ambassador has since told me Qavam sounded him privately about (a) on October 11th and that in reply he drew attention to two objections which would be- likely to be raised (1) that it would be unacceptable to the Persians generally, (2) that it would result in yet another obligation to Russia which would have to be honoured sooner or later. 5. If you see no objection, I would propose, if myself questioned by Prime Minister, to express a personal preference for (b) as being the wiser solution though saying I was speaking without any instructions from you.

Soviet-Persian Oil Agreement. Two recent public statements show the increased interest here in proposals for the exploitation of North Persian oil resources by a Persian Company, making deliveries of oil to the U.S.S.R. . so ns to allow the Russians to acquire Persian oil without the risks attendant on a joint Soviet-Persian Company. 2. In a broadcast talk on the North Persian oil question on September 28th the Director of Propaganda dis cussed Various possible solutions to the problem and emphasised the political and economic advantages of Persia developing the oil herself with only technical assistance from outside. 3. On the same day Abbas Massoudi, an Opposition Deputy and editor of 'Ettela*at' speaking in the Majlis. Urged the Government to add an eleventh point to their programme (see my despatch No. 363) to the effect that they would encourage the exploitation of Persia 1 s natural resources, especially oil, by Persian enterprises which would have the right, subject to Government approval, to sell their products to foreign purchasers. 4. None of the supporters of this proposal go into any detail or.show any signs.of having studied how in fact Persia, with its own capital and technical resources,, will be able to carry out the vnrks of exploitation. But it is of interest that this aspect of the question is being ventilated and that there is some degree of public support for this means of keeping the door open for the satisfaction of Soviet economic requirements. ccc2 2 2 2 GENERAL DISTRIBUTION FROM MOSCOW TO FOREIGN OFFICE Mr Roberts D. 7. 25 p.m. October 7th, 1947 No. 22 20 7th October, 1947.

The Persian prime Minister today read me a telegram he had received from the Persian Ambassador in London, reporting a conversation with Under Secretary in charge of Eastern Affairs at Foreign Office. The Under Secretary had apparently said that His Majesty*s Government thought that Persian Government should have complete freedom to decide on Oil question as they thought best in their own interests and that even in the matter of detail they should act independently of foreign influences. 2. Qavam asked v/hether this in fact represented any change in the policy of His Majesty’s Government who had previously counselled moderation to the Persian Government in their dealings‘v/ith the Soviet Union. He though that since United States Ambassador’s statement we might be moving somewhat in the direction of United States policy and did not now wish to repeat our earlier advice. 3. I said I had had no instructions which*suggested that His Majesty's Government's attitude had altered in the least. v Nor. was there any basic difference between His Ma jesty's GovernTneuf^s policy and that of the United States; we both regarded the sovereignty and independence of Persia as an object of our polic^v . The Xrime Minister agreed and said that he understood that tbere-might he differences of view about methods; 1 confessed thal’this might be true /and,..and that individuals might possibly have different points of view as regards tactics. 4. Qavam added that he did not intend to put the oil agreement before the Majlis until after the conclusion'of debate.on the government's policy. This might still take a week or so (see my telegram No, 39i). •I said the parliamentary position making it necessary for him to obtain a vote of confidence before proceeding was fully understood in London.

Soviet-Rersian Oil Agreement. My information here supports the point made in paragraph 4 that Persian people are at present unusually united on this question and that they are relatively stronger now than could be the case if the question were left open for some time. Though the first reaction to the Soviet nerve war in recent weel:s suggested that something liRe a ^gp. undec./ of defeatism might ensue (see ray telegram Mo#964), the situation is now much steadier, the dissei.iination of alarioing rumours has abated and the Majlis seems more firmly resolved than before to reject the 1946 Agreement. Yet the Russians are presuroably doing all they can to work upon individual raeiibers of the Majlis and their pressure will probably gradually increase over the next few months. If a clear cut decision is not now reached, they may be able to manoeuvre into a stronger position as time passes. 2. On the other hand there is some evidence of a growing belief in the soundness of the advice given by iiis Majesty’s Ambassador and in the wisdom of avoiding any provocation of the Russians. 3. Tclegr&amp;is to and from Washington seem to me to gloss over the fact that although our ultimate political objectives are identical there is really a basic disagreement on the particular question between His Majesty’s Government and United States Government. British policy, evolved at a time when prospects for a general agree ent with Russia appeared more favourable than they do now, is as I understand it, that the Soviet Union should not be denied the possibility of obtaining oil from North Persia to limit the possibilities of Russian political infiltration: United States Govern .ent do wish the Russians to be denied this source of oil believing that any safeguards against infiltration would be inadequate (which we ourselves adiiit to be the case - see Foreign Office telegra No.0781 to Washington). 4. As seen from here, the developments in Burope referred to by Lovett at the beginning of paragraph 4 of Washington telegra i under reference, and the present firmer opposition here to any kind of concession at ail to Russia seems to constitute new factors which 4t would be desirable to take into account in determining our xkx action on a future occasion (see your telegram to Washington Bo.9471 paragraph 4;.

' i! Soviet-Persian Oil Agreement. After a lul-l-of about ten days, official Izvestiya publishes September 24th a special article by Alekseev on ..the Soviet-Persian Oil Agreement. 2. The campaign in certain Persian circles 'against the realisation of this Agreement and the' infringements allowed by the Persian Government ' are said to be 'attracting great attention from the Soviet public'. Alekseev then reviews the history and terms of the Agreement which 'was to signal a new stage in the development of Soviet-Persian relations'. He also reviews the allegedly hostile policy of Persian Governments between 1921 and the Qawam, signature of the Agreement in January 1946, which 'was welcomed by the most v/idely differing section of the Persian public'. 3. Persian papers, including Darya, Irane Ma. Nedjnt, and Tofig are then quoted to suggest advantages of the Agreement to Persia in contrast to the disadvantages of the British concession. Alekseev comments that under the Soviqt Agreement, possibility of intervention in the internal affairs of Persia is excluded, and the sovereignty of the country is not therefore affected. He claims that, in addition to developing Persian industry and reducing unemployment, it would be much m^re profitable to Persia than our concession, from which Persia had only gained L12,000,000 beween 1915 and 1930, less tnan the total company profits for the year 1942 alone. 4. Nevertheless, the Oil Agreement had been opposed by 'those Persian circles now striving to put into effect the former policy of enmity and discrimination towards the Soviet Union'. Qawam*s statement of September 14th proved that the Persian Government intended to repudiate the signing / of....of the Agreement and not to present it to the Majlis for ratification. Alekseev argues that statements about the necessity for obtaining the prior consent of the Majlis were groundless, , since the Persian Government presumably knew their own laws when they originally assumed the obligations of the Agreement and when it was approved by the Shah himself. 5. After a reference to the activities of ’’one foreign diplomat in Tehran”, who had been advising Persian [sic] to be embarrassed by its obligations under the Soviet-Persian Agreement and after quoting the paper Shive to show that the Persian public regarded such advice as selfish and provocative, the article ends; 'It is to be expected that the ruling circles or Persia will also refuse to fellow the advice from outside directed to break the Soviet-Persian Agreement', Foreign Office please pass to Washington as my telegram No. 40A.

I am disturbed by the possibility that the Ministry of Labour may not be retained as a separate Ministry. 2. The labour legislation which has been passed during the past eighteen months is the most striking evidence which the Persian Government can produce to show that they intend to put their affairs in order. The reduction of the Ministry of Labour to the status of a section of some other Ministry would be widely interpreted as meaning that the Persian Government are no longer interested in the improvement of conditions for factory workers, and that pressure from Persian factory owners has been too much for them. It would be most unfortunate for Persia if this impression were to spread in this country and the United States. 3. I shall therefore be .grateful if you would take an early opportunity of raising this question with Q^vam. It might be as well to do so oh the lines that you assume that no appointment to the Ministry of Labour has yet been made because of the difficulty of finding a suitable man for the post. You should explain that I do not wish to interfere in the wav Qavam runs his country, but feel that he may be insufficihntly aware of the # repercussions # on Persia s international position were he to decide that the Ministry of Labour should be reduced to the status of a section of some other Ministry. 4. We do not wish to suggest any names for the post but, for your own information, hope that it will not again.be entrusted to Muzaffar Firuz, and leave it to you to give Qavam a hint to this effect if you have the opportunity.

Repeated to Tehran, Moscow, British Middle East Office Cairo IMMEDIATE. SECRET. Your telegram No.9471. Soviet-Persian Oil Agreement. I discussed these points fully with Mr. Lovett on September 15th. At his suggestion members of my staff have subsequently gone over them first with the Middle East Division and later with Loy Henderson. Your views as set out in paragraph 3 of your telegram have been made clear to all concerned, 2. There was agreement that our common objective must be to preserve the integrity and independence of Persia, that it might not be possible for an oil agreement ~ to be devised which v/ould be compatible with that objective, and that if the matter did come before the United Nations, the Persian case must appear in the best possible light. The State Department also made it clear lhat the United States Government did not (repeat not; wish to persuade the Persians to close the door: their advice had been that the Persian Government must decide in the light of its own best interests and there the matter would now be left. 5. But the State Department, though they realise t that there is no parallel with the 1946 situation, remain unconvinced that a policy of holding the door open, istinati coupled with procrastination, would prove effective and best serve Persia’s interests. They consider that the Soviet Governmentswould soon see through this and increa e their pressure in the manner suggested in paragraph 6 your telegram under reference, so ^hat very little practical advantage would be secured. They do not think that a flat rejection of the agreement by the Mijlis would be contrary even to the spirit of the 1946 agreemen . A refusal by Ghavam tc&gt; submit the agreement to the Majlis v/ould have been, but it has.been clear all along o Ghavam could not under Persian law implement the agree ment by executive action. He had to get Majlis approve and every country possessing full sovereignty had the right to refuse concessions to another if it wisnea now to do' so. An immediate refusal by Persia to S ran t Russia the rights she seeks in the north would seem less dangerous / toto established British interests in the South than a policy which left the way open to protracted bargain- +{? g l Department did not (repeat not*) believe that a flat refusal would weaken any Persian case ‘ before wprld opinion or.that policy you prefer would necessarily strengthen it. The Persian Government could instance events in Azerbaijan last year as justifying suspicion of Soviet intentions and could use with great effect the nature and tone of the representations which the Soviet Ambassador had recently made. These were not such as should be employed towards another Sovereign State and they thought that most members of the Security Council would,.as in the case of Greece, have little difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the Persian Government good case, even in the probable event of the boviet Government proceeding by guile rather than by open force. 4, State Department’s attitude to this question is evidently governed by their general attitude towards the.Soviet Government at the present time, Loyett put it to me that the United States Government had unsuccessfully tried in the past various means of getting on with the Soviet Government and were now determined to resist every kind of Soviet aggression wherever it shov/ed itself (short of engaging in a. M shooting match ,, )« Henderson put it that procrastination and patience had failed in Poland and.the Balkans and that, the Middle Bast being vital f a fight must.if necessary be put up now* M no matter where the chips might fall ,, . The Persian people were at present united to an unusual degree upon this question. They were therefore relatively stronger than v/ould probably be the case if the question were left for some time in an unsettled state. Such delay would.give the Soviet Government opportunity of exerting pressure by various means upon members of the Majlis and otherwise stirring up unrest in the country* If the Majlis.were to close the door and Soviet intervention in some form v/ere to ensue, there would be a much better chance of a clear-cut case, should the Persian Government feel obliged to appeal to the Security Council, since Soviet action would then be clearly linked to the Majlis* decision. 5, State Department were asked what the United States Government would be prepared to do in the event of drastic Soviet action, and their attention was drawn to the fact that the way was still open for in direct Soviet interference in Greece, in spite of the majority view of the Security Council, since a Soviet veto had so far blocked effective action. They said that they thought that the same procedure should be employed as in the case of Greece, namely that the Security Council should consider the matter under Chapter 6 and then* if necessary, under Chapter 7 of the /Charter.- 3 - Charter, The General Assembly might also be seized of the question in the event of a Soviet veto in the Security Council. There was at present no question of implementing in Persia a policy corresponding to the Greek and Turkish programmes (see paragraph 4 of Tehran telegram No,958) and the action that the United States Government might take in the event of really drastic Soviet action would depend upon the circumstances. Such action would in any case have repercussions far beyond the borders of Persia and might endanger the whole structure of the United Nations. But the State Department were convinced that, in the event of a rejection of the agreement by the Majlis, it v/ould be far wiser in the interests of all of us that a firm stand should be made now. 6. I do not think that we shall now shake them in this conviction. It appears to be based upon what they claim to be ’’mature reflexion” and full appreciation oi the implications of the policy which they are hoping the Persian Government vail pursue.

He no doubt feels.it necessary to adopt this wording to meet his local political difficulties. But any official statement of His Majesty's Government's attitude would have to refer to the advice which His Majesty's Ambassador.gave the Prime Minister about keeping the aoor open and the impression might then be created that we were at odds with the Persian Government. This would be unfortunate the more so as the rest of Qavam s statement is an excellent and sober presentation of his point of view and is in general calculated to have.a calming influence. His Majesty's Government's general attitude has been made clear by the B.B.C. broadcast of the gist of the article in the Times of the 15th September.by their diplomatic correspondent (text of article is given in my immediately following telegram) and it does not seem that an official statement would serve any useful purpose at this stage. As regards the allegations of secret agreements or discussions between His Majesty's Government and the Russians for the division of Persia into spheres of.influence the B.B.C. were authorised to deny the.allegation as soon as it appeared and repetition of the denial would only weaken its force. \2084 [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on] f. ***4 a* Cypher/OTP.

Aim of arrests is to smash democratic organisations in Persia. 2, Second item dated September 12th quotes leading article of weekly paper Mozarfar, entitled 'Persian- Soviet Friendship' to the effect that all Persian Governments over the last 25 years have attempted to place obstacles in way of friendly relations between Persia and U.S.S.R., that this political course has been harmful to Persian masses, and must be revised as soon as possible.OUTWARD TELEGRAM •* EXT o or? 19 [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be -etained by the authorised recipient and not passed on.] B.8486/1/34 SECRET Cypher/OTP CABINET DISTRIBUTION So. 699 FRaM FOREIGN OFFICE TO TEHRAN D. 5.00 p.m. 13th September, 194?. 13th September, 1947 Repeated to ; Moscow No. 2978 Vfashlngton No. 9472 British Middle East Office, Cairo^ No. 201 Saving IMPOR TANT M Your telegram No. 96 4 [ of 11th September: Soviet- Persian Oil Agreement}.

Soviet Persian Oil Agreement. United States Ambassador has released to the press text of a speech he will make tonight at a dinner of the Persian American Society. 2, Speech contains a passage affirming American opposition to attempts to extract concessions from Persia under threats or duress. 3. It begins by saying that United States Government has frequently made known its respect for the sovereignty of Persia and that an important aspect of sovereignty is the full right of a country to dispose as it wishes of its own natural resources. RTter adding that the United States has not proper concern with commercial proposals made solely on their own merits 'to stand or fall on their value to Persia' statement continues textually as follows: However, we and every other nation of the world do become concerned when such proposals are accompanied by threats of bitter enmity or by statements that it would be dangerous for Persia to refuse. The United States is firm in its conviction that any proposals made by one sovereign Government to another should not be accompanied by threats or intimidations. When such methods are used in an effort to obtain acceptance, doubt is cast on the value of the proposals themselves. /TheThe United States has dedicated its full energy and resources to freeing the peoples of the world from the fear of aggression, t Our determination to follow this policy as regards Persia is as strong as it is anywhere else in the world. This purpose can be achieved to the extent the Persian people show determination to 'defend their own sovereignty. Patriotic Persians when considering matters affecting their national interest may therefore rest assured that the .iiTierican people will support fully their freedom to make their own choice.

Some residents at Tabriz who are regarded by Russians as 'reactionaries' are said to be making arrangements to leave, finding that they have pressing business in parts of Persia further removed from the frontier and impression is gaining ground that the Red Army will. re-occupy Azerbaijan and north Khorassan if the iviajlis reject the 1946 agreement. Great majority [grp. undec. J in all parts of the country but morale is beginning to be. shaken and unless tendency is checked it may lead to widespread defeatism and resignation. 2. In these circumstances you may think the moment appropriate to try and persuade Persians that they are over apprehensive. This could be done by taking a more active line than that suggested in your telegram No. 681 Mandate and inspiring a commentaiy on the following lines. [Begins] 3. There is widespread speculation as to what action Persian Parliament now being constituted will take about Sadchikov-Qavam oil agreement of April 1946. Reacting to pronouncements made by Moscow Press and Radio the press pi Tehran has with scarcely an exception been 2 u ^ s ??^5 n r, ln - 4 . opposing the agreement. It has been suggested that Soviet Government might take some drastic action if agreement were in fact rejected by Persian Parliament. This would be a matter or great concern not 9 n -ty • United Nations as a whole and it is unthinkable that Soviet Government would resort to force in any such contingency. The Soviet Government are signatories to the United Nations Charter/..,.,~ 2 - Charter and in consequence are pledged to refrain from threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political inaependenco of any state and also to settle their international disputes hv peaceful^ means. It nay therefore be assumed that if the Persian Government and people remain unconvinced of the benefit to Persia or the proposed joint oil company Soviet Government would not wish to contravene their solemn undertakings by taking any action which would be contrary to the United Nations Charter, • • • ' ‘ [Ends] 4, It would be best that such commentary should be included very early in an article or commentary by some well-known writer in such a way that it could be subsequently quoted by B.B.C. in their Persian transmission.Bn Clair GBNERuL DISTRIBUTION r— ^ ^ FROM liOSCO-T TO FQRBIGil OFFICB Mr, Roberts No, 2049 D. 12.05 p.m. GMT 11th September 1947 R. 4.15 p.n.

I am particularly 1 anxious that the United States ;&gt; authorities should fully appreciate the implications of the, ■; policy which they are hoping the Persian Government will pursue.. If the Majlis reject the present draft agreement out of hand it seems quite likely that the Soviet Government will take drastic action to secure its requirements. What are the United States Government prepared to do in such circumstances to support Persia? I assume that their support ' would he limited to action in the Security Council and that they would rely on securing by this means a result equally favourable2 . favourable as that obtained in 1946. There are, however, important differences between the situation at that time and that which may develop now. In 1946 the Russians were flagrantly violating their Treaty obligation to withdraw their troops and could not point to any serious ground for doing so. In the present case various means of pressure are open to the Soviet Government other than the actual despatch of troops into Persia. They can, for instance,’ cau^e serious trouble by arranging for the entry into Azerbaijan of Persian and Kurdish malcontents now apparently concentrated on the Soviet side of the border and they can no doubt revive political arid industrial unrest by means of new instructions and assistance to the Tudeh Party. - ''They Would also claim, if the Majlis simply rejected the draft Agreement, that this was contrary to the spirit though not to the letter of the 1946 Agreement. In circumstances of this kind, there would be less prospect that any action we or the Americans might take in the Security Council would prove effective even though the actual danger to Persia might be'almost equally great* It is for this reason that we feel it to be of the greatest importance that-the Persian case should appear;to world opinion to be as strong as possible and an important way of strengthening it would be for.the Majlis, as we have suggested to Qawam, not finally . to ciose-the door on- the possibility of negotiations on a different basis. A more.supple attitude of this kind would also-be far more in^accordance with the Persian-temperament and would give full play to their capacity for negotiation and procrastination which is in some ways their strongest card. ‘ 4. • As you will have .seen from my telegram No. 691 to Tehran we do not intend for the present to give any further advice to the Persian Government but we should very much like to be assured in advance that if the time comes for us or the Americans to do so again we may be able to act on exactly the same lines. - • ;r OUTWARD TELEGRAM [This telegram is of particular secrecy an»d~ahaul4_be_ retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on].

Sir J. Le Rcugetel took the opportunity to point out that His Majesty's Government’s policy new as in the past was that the Persian Government must make up their own minds about the oil agreement.

The American Ambassador had a long talk with Shah on September 6 th about Soviet Persian Oil Agreement^and gathered the impression that Qavam, in conversation with Shah, had been inclined to misinterpret the advice 'leaving the door open' (your telegram No. 658 paragraph 3) as meaning that you wished Persia to agree to terms which would be regarded as satisfactory by Soviet Government, even if they were unsatisfactory for Persia* Ambassador feared therefore that there was a cpnsiderable danger that Qavam, in order to justify himself in yielding to.the Russians, v/ould seek to place the blame on His Majesty s Government. The Shah had said that British policy had 'softened' and Ambassador feared that it would now be said that v/e had come to some arrangement with^ the Russians at the expense of Persian interests, and that it might even become necessary for United States Government to make a statement that, unlike His Majesty s Government, they had given no advice whatever on this question to Persian Government. 2. Allan thinks Qavam will now^approach the Russians with a new proposal of his own, possibly in the form of a draft agreement based on general principles of 1946 exchange of letters but with conditions such as to limit opportunities for Soviet infiltration. This is not.incomputable with wishes of His Majesty* s Government but it is not at all . what Allan had himself expected as he had hoped the Majlis in a resolution as unprovocatively worded as possible would categorically reject 1946 agreement, 3, Fact that Qavam spoke as he did to the Shah suggests that he may now be preparing the ground to get the Majlis to approve in principle the 1946 exchange of letters so as to enable him to negotiate an agreement with the Russians as stated in paragraph 4 of your telegram ? No. 675._ But he will have little lattitude for negotiation TTTieis tied in principle to 1946 letters. 4 ./...,4, Shah had apparently also urged on the American Ambassador very strongly the desirability of United States Government pursuing a similar policy in Persia to that at present being implemented towards Greece and Turkey and said he hoped for a United States guarantee of aimed assistance if the Red Aimy crossed the frontier. The Ambassador * replied United States policy, was firmly based on United Nations, taking the Shah to task for a derogatory remark which he had made about ineffectiveness of United Nations assistance and reminding his Majesty with force of Persia's experience in 1946. and that bilateral undertakings of the kind suggested were both incompatable with United States policy and likely to give rise to a reaction in United States opinion and thus prove.a disservice to the very countries which it was their object to assist.

The '’Pravda 1 ’ article which was broadcast in the Persian transmission from Moscow and fully reproduced in the Persian Press has been strongly criticised by all except the extreme Left ncY^spapers here as a first move in the war of nerves. Particular exception has been taken, even by Moderate and Left newspapers, to the reference to the Shah and the alleged pro-Hitler tendencies of his father's regime. Right and Centre newspapers attribute this reference to Muzaffar Firouz. 2.In its edition of August 26th, 'Ettela'at' (Centre) objected to the 'Travis' allegation that it was advocating Persia's entry into the anti-Soviet front along with Turkey and Iraq, and maintained that, in fact, it had consistently been opposed to Persia's joining any political bloc and had advocated a policy of friendship with all Persia's neighbours and all the Great Powers without preference for this or that country. The purpose of the 'Pravda' article was presumably, to intimidate the Persians and so make it impossible for them to deal with the problem of the oil question with the care which their interests demand. But the Persian people would not be intimidated or rushed. The oil in the North was theirs and they had the right to say whether they wanted this agreement or not. They would go into the question carefully and would be guided one hundred per cent by their own interests in order to make sure that decisions like those of the past ifh.ich were prejudicial to the country were not taken again. 3.

He asked whether I had discussed the matter with the ^jnerican .ambassador and whether I thought it advisable that he should do so himself. I said I thought there was everything to be gained by a free and frank discussion of the matter with Mr. iillen and I made it clear that I invariably pursued this course with him. The Shah expressed agreement and ‘ said he would act accordingly. 5. Amongst other matters the Shall referred to the prospect of forming a new Government. Although he did not dot the u I n s* I have little doubt that he is determined to get rid of Qavam as soon as vote on oil agreement has been taken but that as yet he has not yet decided ha/; to set about it or whom to appoint in Qavam’s place.

You will have seen from my.telegram No: 658 to Tehran .the line which I have now decided to take with the Persian Government. It is not, I think, likely to f ive .the impression that there is a divergence of view etween the British and United States Governments, 3, In fact our two Governments are at one in desiring the maintenance of Persian independence. Our views diverge only as regards the policy which we think the Persian Government should pursue to this end. In considering the dangers which threaten Persian independence the United States Government have been more impressed with the dangers that will flow from any Soviet oil concession m the North and His Majesty's Government with the dangers that might flow from a Persian refusal to meet the Russians at ail. 4, For your own information His Majesty's Government are of course well aware of the danger that no safeguards can be devisedin any Sovie o'*F or o jan oil agreement which will be effective in the face of a deliberate policy ofpdilical penetration. There is therefore a very real danger that any Soviet-Persian oil agreement will lead first to the domination of North Persia by the Soviet Union and then to Soviet control of the central Government e Nevertheless, it has been our view, since Qawan gave Ms undertaking in 1946. that the Persians probably have a better chance of maintaining their independence m the long run if theythey go sone way to meet the Soviet Governnent than if they return a blank negative to their demands. The latter course of action night provoke the Russians either to invade Persia or to secure control of the central Governnont by organising a revolutionary coup d f ctat. Either of these would be still more dangerous to Persian independence than a Soviet-Persian oil agreement, since if the Russians invade Persia, there is no guarantee that the Persians will receive United States military support and if the Russians were to inspire a Tudeh coup d f dtat, effective American action is even less likely. It was on such considerations that paragraphs 2 and 3 of our telegram No: 8410 were based, i leave it to your judgement whether to speak to the State Department on the lines of this paragraph or not.With the compliments of the Under-Secretary of for Foreign Affairs ’ e: )&lt;ri!

Repeated to: Tehran No, 24, Washington No, 341 LviPQRTANT LIG-HT Soviet-Persian Oil Agreement, Pravda for the 24th of August prints tuo-column article by S. Vladimirov entitled 'The intrigues of_ Persian reactionaries' reviewing the present situation with regard to the setting up of a joint Soviet-Persian oil company, 2. After recalling the terms of the Sovict-Persian treaty of April 1946 the writer remarks that the news that the Soviet Ambassador had handed the Persian Prime Minister a draft agreement for the organisation of the company 'has worked [sic; ? evoked] a number of hostile statements by reactionary Tehran newspapers aimed at disrupting the Soviet-Persian treaty'. These newspapers ‘‘expressing the interests of a group of Persian reactionaries and certain foreign circles' try to justify their anti-Soviet attitude by reference to the 'national' interest of Persia. In reply to Tehran Liosavvars statement that 'the Persian people is opposed to offering any concession' Vladimirov declared that the Soviet-Persian treaty does not speak of a 'concession' but of a 'joint company' and that the [grp.undec.? attitude] of the Persian people should be judged not be statements in reactionary newspapers but by those made by representatives of “mass democratic organi sations' by the 'progressive Persian press' and even by some representative of Right Wing circles who welcomed the oil agreement at the time of its signature, Vladimirov^ concludes that Tehran Mosawars statement that the Persian people is opposed to the agreement does not reflect the mood of wide public circles in Persia but is dictated by certain foreign circles who are trying to disrupt Soviet-Persian oil agreements.3. Vladinirov then proceeds to refute a statement in Kesra that the Soviet-Persian agreement was signed in the face of force _and hatred by quoting at length from Qawam’s statement in ilay and June 1946 in defence of his Moscov/ negotiations. 4* Vladimirov maintains that proof that Persian reactionaries are not concerned about Persist national interests but are acting as agents of 'foreign circles' may be found in Kesra's statement that the terms of the British oil concession are more favourable to Persia that the terms of the Soviet-Persian oil agreements. Vladimirov says that the British concessions are based on inequality, amounts to a state within a state and is. contrary to Persian state sovereignty. The Soviet-Persian agreement is based on respect for Persian political and economic independence.and contributes in full measure to the develop ment of Persian national economy. Moreover the British concession pays Persia only ai insignificant share of its profits and allows the Persians no part in the administration of the concession, 3. Vladimirov then recalls that the anti-Soviet interests of Persian reactionaries are nothing now. They found expression in the pro-Hitler policy of the Resa Shah Government. Persian reactionaries now continue' to conduct an anti-Soviet policy for the benefit of “certain foreign circles' and are already speaking openly of entering the anti-Soviet front 'along with Turkey and Iraq'. This is why they are making every effort to disrupt the Soviet- Persian oil agreement, 6 , Lately Persian Government circles responsible for the country’s foreign policy headed by the Shah and Prime Minister Qawam have started to follow the same path, Qawam's interview to Le Monde shov/s that he is preparing to reject the obligations assumed by the Persian Government with regard to the Soviet-Persian Oil Company. 7. Vladimirov concludes by saying that the anti-Soviet campaign enjoys the support and sympathy of 'court circles'' and the Shah himself and that whether Government circles will continue on this ‘'dangerous path' will be shown in the near future.

If as I assume it is our main pre-occupation that Soviet Government should be convinced that they are not being obstructed, this aim would surely be achieved eaju.l y well by formula embodied in advice which you rec y gave to Persian Ambassador ( see your telegram No. 639 paragraph 2 last sentence) which is not open m any g like the same degree, to the above objection. ?

The Prime Minister who is ill again was in bed. He expressed appreciation of your viev/s but pointed out that he had not instructed Mr, Rais to make any enquiry. He had simply asked him to inform you of his recent conversations with the Soviet Ambassador. 2. The Prime Minister then gave me the following account of more recent developments. Just before he took to his bed again yesterday he received the Soviet Ambassador who reiterated the request which he had made by telephone on August 14th (see mv telegram No. 902). The Prime Minister explained once more that in view of the law of December 2nd 1944 it v/as quite impossible for him or any other representa tive of the Persian Government to sign an agreement about oil unless they were specifically authorised to do so by the Majlis. He also pointed out that only one member of the Government which had approved his letter of last year was in the present Government. But in view of the Ambassador’s insistence he suggested that his request be referred to the Cabinet last night. The Cabinet’s decision was communicated to Mr. Sadtchikov by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning. It fully endorsed the Prime Minister’s reply and it also stated that as soon as the Majlis was constituted, its first duty would be to express approval, or disapproval, of all important measures taken since the previous Majlis was dissolved. The Qavam-Sadtchikov exchange of notes was one of these. If it were approved there would be no legal impediment to negotiation or an agreement on the lines indicated. If it were not approved such negotiation would be impossible. 3. Mr. Sadtchikov told Mr. Humayunjah that he would inform his Government of the Cabinet s decision but he expressed/,expressed the view that the Prime Minister was. trying to 'double-cross” him and that by his vacillation and evasiveness he was jeopardising the independence or his ooontry. 4. The Prime Minister enquired whether I [grps. omit.] comment and I said that I did not but he countered me by asking whether I thought the Soviet Ambassador*s threat should be taken seriously. I said I could see no point in attempting to assess what lay behind the language used by Mr. Sadtchikov but it was of the first importance that the Persian Government should determine now what attitude on their own part would be [grps. omit.] the Prime Minister did not insist further bur he asked me to tell you that he hoped very shortly to receive your comment on what he had just told me. 5. Events have nov/ moved so far that I doubt Hhether any useful purpose would be served by giving Mr. Rais a further reply on lines suggested in your telegram No. 638. Apart from the fact that he appears to have made this enquiry on his own initiative he is most unlikely to be aware yet of what occurred yesterday. I would therefore suggest that any observations you may wish to make should take the form of a comment on the Prime Minister’s latest request and I propose to deal with this in another telegram.

Soviet-Persian Oil Agreement, United States Government's views on this question have been sent to United States Embassies in London and Tehran, with instructions that gist should be conveyed to you and Sir Ian Le Rougetel, I presume, therefore, that you are now aware of them. 2. I yesterday gave Loy Henderson your own views. He infoimed me that he had just seen the Persian Minister in Washington who had spoken in same sense as Persian Minister in London (your telegram No.8416 paragraph 1) and had enquired whether United States Government would give Persia more than moral support in the event of an overt Soviet threat to her independence. 5. Henderson had replied that it was not proper for the United States Government to attempt to influence the * Persian Government on the grant or refusal of the oil concession. The Persian Government must ask them selves what the effect of such an agreement would be on the long-term economic and political situation in Persia and musx decide their course of action for themselves # This would place the United States Government in a much better position to help them in the United Nations if the need arose. The United States Government would support Persia in the United Nations if any Soviet action appeared to contravene the Charter and this in itself would constitute more than moral support. As t regards an overt threat to Persian independence, the United States Government could not say in advance what it would do in the event of aimed Soviet intervention: this must be decided in the light of events at the time (with which the Persian Minister agreed). Moreover, such inter- vention would endanger the whole structure of the United Nations and threaten world security with repercussions far beyond Persia. /4*o _ 4 C TUe Persian Minister had then suggested that the Soviet Government might attempt to overthrow the Persian Government by clandestine means, in which event it mignt be difficult for the latter to make a case before the United Nations. Henderson had replied that the United Nations and the world understood this kind of penetration much better than a year ago. 5. fhe Persian Minister had also informed Henderson that he had suggested to the Persian Prime Minister some title ago that, if the Majlis were to oppose an Oil Agreement with the Soviets, the Persian Government should thereupon make it clear that Persia would, develop her own resources and sell oil freely to the Soviet Government at world prices. He.had also suggested as an alternative that the Persian Government might announce-that it would in future onj-y .grant -concessions to foreigners under a multilateral agreement under the aegis of the United Nations, Henderson had refused to be drawn on these suggestions, but had pointed out that, though the Soviet Government had’ itself at one time granted conces,sions to foreigners, it had later dis continued this policy, 6, Henderson, made- it clear to me that the State Department do not (repeat not) share the view expressed in. paragraph 5 of your telegram under reference,. They are firmly of opinion that in fact no agreement ^an be negotiated which would ade quately safeguard the integrity of Persia.- Henderson pointed out tnat Ghavam had concluded the 1946 Agreement under duress and with the object of securing the evacuation of Soviet troops from Persia. The Soviet Government, he observed, had not kept their side of the bargain, but had left stooges behind to organise the Azerbaijan revolt. The Majlis could not therefore be blamed for their fear of Soviet infiltration* the pattern of' s which had become so abundantly clear during the past year. 7 C Tie State Department evidently hope that some means, perhaps on the lines suggested by the Persian Minister in the fifth paragraph above, may be found to close the door if the Majlis turns down the agreement. But, as is disclosed by their • telegram to the United States Ambassador in Tehran, they do not propose so to inform the Persian Government, It nevertheless seems apparent from the terms of their telegram, (at which we have only been able to glance briefly), that the State Department are concerned i'.o direct the thoughts of the Persian Government towards the dangers which the State Depart ment foresee in any Oil Agreement with the Soviets.

I am thinking of replying further to the Persian Government as follows 2. In the first place I shall repeat my advice that the Persian Government should make it known to the world that they do not intend or desire to repudiate their undertakings and are prepared, subject to obtaining the necessary authority from the Majlis, to negotiate a detailed agreement v/ith the Russians regarding oil based on the principles set forth in the documents signed in April, 1946. It is clear that the Persian Government will wish during these negotiations to safeguard the interests of their country and that the new agreement to be negotiated will have to lay down the conditions under which the new joint Russian-Persian oil company will operate during the next fifty years. The principles already agreed will thus require much elaboration. 3. I shall then advise the Persian Government that if the Majlis decides to reject the whole basis of the agreement reached between Qawam and the Soviet ambassador in Mpril, 1946, it should in my view be careful not to close the door absolutely on all negotiations with the Soviet Union in respect of North Persian oil, but should indicate on what lines it considers that a fresh agreement should be negotiated on terms which it may consider more satisfactory to Persia. /44. regards ^av/am's enquiry as to the attitude, of His Majesty* s Governraent and the United States Government if the Soviet Government send the Persians an ultimatum or resort to force, presumably the only possible reply is that if, at any time Persia can show that her independence or integrity has been seriously endangered, she should appeal to the Security Council. Our support for Persia's case on previous occasions sufficiently demonstrates our desire to see her independence respected. But we consider that it would be premature for Persia to appeal to the Security Council at this stage. 5. Please inform State Department and explain that, before replying to the Persians, I should like to have their views and to know how the State Department propose to reply to the enquiry which, it appears, they have also received from the Persian Prime Minister. I am particularly anxious that we should keep in step.

The telegram opened, with an account of Qavan/s conversations with the Soviet ambassador on the lines already described in your telegrams. It then set out Qavam's views as follows: The Russians are very determined and are concentrating troops near Persian frontiers. ^ draft agreement on the lines desired by the Russians will now have to be submitted to the Majlis. If the Majlis reject it, the Russians might send the Persian Government an ultimatum. The Persian Government would reject it. They could not tell what would happen after that but the Russians might use force. Qavam wanted to know '/hat help Persia's friends would give her in this eventuality apart from the moral support already available. 2. I said that I should need time to study the question before giving a final answer, but I could explain my general attitude to the question to the Soviet-PersiaimOil agreement at once. I had always thought that the Persian Prime Minister should keep the undertaking which he had given, but I had likewise always understood that any Soviet-Persian Oil agreement which was finally concluded would be freely negotiated and /would)* \ - 2 - v/ould bu fair and businesslike, and would satisfy the Persian Government that their integrity was not endangered by it. It looked now very much as if the Persian Government were being handled in a “take it or leave it“manner and the present proceedings could hardly be described as negotia tions at all. I thought that the P-ersian Govern ment would be well advised to make it known to the w °rld that they were not going back on any under takings and were ready to negotiate an agreement on ter-s acceptable to both parties, which did not threaten the integrity and independence of Persia- , 3.

Repeated to Moscow /// IMMEDIATE TOP SECRET LIGHT The Soviet Ambassador on his return from Moscow saw the Prime Minister yesterday morning and^following account of their meeting was given to me by M. Nikpay on Prime Minister*s instructions. 2. Soviet Ambassador produced text of an agreement which embodies points covered in Prime Minister*s letter to him of April 1946,and provides for conclusion v/ithin three months of a convention under which the joint company will operate. He said that this text had been approved by the Soviet Government who expected it to be submitted to and passed by the Majlis without modification. ^ They would judge by Persia* s response v/hether she wished to have friendly relations with the Soviet Union or not. The Soviet Ambassador was under some emotional stress when presenting this demand. 5. The Prime Minister declared that political situation in this country had changed very considerably since his letter was written. If the Soviet Government insisted, he would submit the text which the Ambassador had given him to Majlis but there was not the slightest prospect of it being passed by them. M. Sadtchikov made light of this difficulty and enquired what Persian reaction would be if Soviet Government were now to ask lor a concession similar to that held by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The Prime Minister reminded him that when the Anglo-iranian concession was first negotiated and again when it was renewed fourteen years ago, this country was ruled by autocratic monarchs who had absolute power oyer fgp.undec.] and property of all their subjects. To-day the position was radically different and it was quite impossible for him as Prime Minister to force the passage of a bill against a majority in the Majlis. t The rejection of this bill by a large majority would certainly not promote the friendly relations which he had at heart and he therefore begged the Ambassador to urge his Government /to reconsiderto reconsider their attitude and .to exolnre with hi™ u h %p^t S h^ li1:y °? some alternative form of agreement Primt d Mi5is?LTnih^ t + ^ dert + ake to d^this In! thf* the Majlis I would he S f!l!v U !^Jt S ^ e a d v y '^ session ' that week but yesterday the m nnS??v ltuted V y 4 -^ e end **pti3!misrsm&amp; Foreign Office pass Washington as my telegram No. 60.

The Prime Minister asked to see me this morning and on his own initiative raised the question of the oil agreement with Russia. 2. He made it clear that all reports of his intention to go back on his undertaking were entirely baseless but that the agreement would have to contain adequate financial and political safeguards. The drafting of the agreement and in particular of safeguarding clauses would however be a matter of great practical difficulty, for the Persian Government did not command the services of sufficiently experienced advisers. It was obviously undesirable that they should consult the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company no matter how discreetly this was done and the Prime Minister therefore wished to know whether you would agree that we should fill the gap. For this purpose I should nave attached to my staff while the agreement was being drafted a suitably qualified expert whose real function would be known only to the Prime Minister and myself* I told the Prime Minister that I would transmit this request to you but that I naturally could not say what view you would take of such a proposal. 3. The Prime Minister emphasised more than once the paramount importance of secrecy and I am sure that he had no illusions whatever aoout the effect of a leakage upon relations with the Soviet Union. At the same time it is all too true that the Persian Government do not dispose of experts vrtio are qualified to advise them in such a matter. For political reasons it would be extremely difficult for tae Prime Minister openly to co opt advice from any foreign power or from an international body and I suspect that there are few if any foreign powers other than ourselves on whose discretion he feels that he can rely. If however the agreement is not well drafted and does not include effeotive safeguards the consequences for Persia and also for Great Britain may be disastrous. ,7ith great respect I would therefore urge that the Prime Minister’s request be given very serious consideration and that if it is considered unacceptable we should make some constructive counter proposal.[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on] Cypher/OTP CABINET DISTRIBUTION % PROM TEHRAN TO,FOREIGN OFFICE Mr. Le Rougetel, D. 7.31 a.nu 22nd January,1947.

Minister of War raised this question with the Military Attach6 yesterday. He said that the Prime Minister was making a great mistake if he thought that the new Majlis would pass the agreement. The feeling against it in the country was far too strong and it was believed that Qavam had made his promise to the Russians under duress. ,• 2. The Prime Minister suggested the Minister said* that postponement for a year or so might facilitate a solution and that the agreement when concluded would contain adequate safeguards.

I cannot at present confirm this report but d,aririg the past few weeks the subject of oil agreement has been raised in conversation by persons in the confidence of the Shah and the Prime Minister whose purpose I believe it was to draw me. The last occasion was two days ago. 2. I have made no secret of my conviction that it would be the pitch of folly for this country to expose itself to the charge of denying the Russians legitimate access to its oil. I have also warned them that if the Majlis were to refuse to give the oil agreement serious consideration, this impression would inevitably be created, and the Persian Government would very soon have reason to repent of their ineptitude. On the other hand they clearly owe it to themselves and to the Persians to ensure the oil agreement contains adequate safeguards against attempts to undermine the Persian*J sovereignty under cover of an oil agreement. It should not be beyond their power to devise such safeguards and if they are rejected, the Persian’s position will be clear.( 2 ) / £&lt;t^/ i j I f fr&gt; ' * ' f 7 5.

Peterson. No. 14. Tst January 1947 Repeated to Washington, Tehran. IMPORTANT LIGHT § SCR ST I understand that United States Embassy here have received a telegram from Tehran reporting that the Persian Chief of Staff had told the United States Military Attachd in strict confidence that plans were being made to have the Soviet oil concession turned down by the Majlis. The Chief of Staff was said to have stated that Qawam approved this plan. The telegram asked how far the Persian fear was justified that if the Russians were allowed in North Persia to exploit the oil this would lead to political infiltration on such a scale that not only Azerbaijan but all the oil concession area would be subverted. 2 . I am reporting this in case you have not had it direct, although I do not suggest that we need necessarily take this American information as gospel. It may well be an unauthorised ballon d’essai by the Persian Chief of Staff, especially since the Persian Ambassador here told me that no Persian Majlis, however constituted, would venture to turn down the Soviet concession. On the other hand, Firuz is not a very reliable informant and at this crisis in his country’s relations with the U.S.S.R. has gone off to Bucharest with his wife. 3. I understand that the American Ambassador here is advising the State Department that while the Russians would not intervene forcibly at present, they would never accept the situation if the Persians tore up the oil agreement and that it would be preferable for the oil concession to go through provided that it was hedged round with all possible safeguards. 4. While the Russians will undoubtedly use the oil concession as a means of political infiltration (see Mr. Roberts* telegram No. 1163 of Novftmb rv /s i 9 VM arc fa? 26th) it might be possible for the Ma3TIs‘ r 't&lt;5“ Impose' conditions which would make it difficult for the Russians to run North Persia as a closed area; for example the Persians might insist that the agreement should give the Russians no greater rights than we enjoy in South Persia. In any event, I cannot help feeling that it would be the height of folly on the part of the Persian Government to go back upon their agree ment merely because they think they have won a victory over the Russiansin Azerbaijan, and that we should therefore do nothing which might be interpreted as encouraging them to do so.

I agree that we should do nothing which could reasonably he interpreted as encouraging the Persian Government to go hack on their promise to sign an oil agreement with the Soviet Government. Our attitude towards the Soviet-Persian Oil Agreement is that we do not object to the Soviet Union obtaining oil from North Persia on terms which are fair and acceptable to Persia. 2. If, therefore, you consider that the Persian Government are in fact trying to arrange that the draft Soviet-Persian Agreement should be rejected by the new Majlis, I should like you to warn the Persian Prime Minister that he would do well to reflect on the possible conse quences of provoking the Russians in this way. I am, of course, fullyaware of the danger of giving the impression that we are ganging up with the Russians against the Persians. Consequently, should you have to give the PrimeOUTWARD TELEGRAM - 2 - t J Prime Minister the above advice, you should at the same time say that I am fully aware of the importance of the agreement being financially and otherwise fair to Persia, and of the importance of the agreement being hedged around with all possible safeguards to prevent it being used as a means of political infiltration, I consider that the Majlis can and should seek to ensure that these points are covered.32375-1 I € •i c \ t* With the Compliments v^\ OF THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ECRET Foreign Office, “1 ' j 194 .[This telegram is of particular secrecy and* should he retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on], Cypher/OTP.

W:W:W:W:W Comment in the Soviet press about Persia is being increasingly directed to stigmatising the Persian Government as reactionary and engaged in persecuting Democrats, for instance, ’Trud' of 31st December in an article entitled ’’Repression of Workers in Iran” states ’’Preparations for the elections have been accompanied by an unparalleled outbreak of reaction, which has now taken the form of open and unrestrained terror against the v/orkers and their Trades Unions”. The article quotes a wealth of detailed ’’evidence” which it says the W.F.T.U. should examine [gp. undec.]. The article also quotes the Tudeh Party’s recent statement ’’The interests of international magnates can only for a time postpone the introduction of social reforms”, the campaign on these lines is underlined by the extensive quotation of a leaflet distributed by the Tudeh Party refuting allegations about Mazanderan plot and absence of electoral freedom. 2. The Soviet Union is building up a case in public which would enable it to indict the Persian Government either before U.N.0. or W.F.T.U. Whether this will actually be done is difficult to say; Soviet Government will probably wait to see what happenshappens about the oil concession. But it might be useful from the point of view of world opinion if due publicity could be given to any measures of social reform and reports of conspicuous moderation by the Persian Government, 5. Although all this is no doubt partly for the record, it strengthens my feeling that Persian Government ought not be allowed themselves to be carried away by their easy victory in Azerbaijan (see my telegram No.14).

As it is they have not done too badly. The major shareholding during the first 25 years is Russian so the company can if it so desires concentrate on a policy of cheap and uneconomic production of oil for Russia rather than on declaring a dividend for the benefit of Persian shareholders. It is precisely because profits were such a risky thing on which to base payments to the Government granting concession that most modem concessions base such payments principally on amount of oil produced. For instance payments in original Anglo Persian concession were based on profits but in current concession are oil♦ 'A Of • •- 2 - If the Soviet Union were the enlightened benefactor it claims to be the payment of so much per ton of oil produced with a minimum payment of so much a year should have figured in exchange of notes even if all other benefits to Persia are omitted as n technical details to be settled later'.

The article criticises the efforts made to get the Security Council to intervene in Soviei-Pepsian affairs. It says that Soviet troops were* -sent into Persia, under .the 1921 Treaty which is described as the basis of Soviet~?.ersian relations until now and that the real reason for delay in withdrawing them was that the Soviet Government -could have no faith in*the intentions of a Persian Government led by Hakimi right up to February 1946, There was and could be nothing in the relations between.

There are no doubt many important considerations to be taken into account, relation between agreement and decisions of the Security Council and the effect of the agreement on British oil interests. But you may wish to bear in mind that many Left-wing and other commentators in this country have all along made great play with the allegation that the whole Persian dispute has been a battle between the U.S.S.R. and the United Kingdom for the control of oil reserves in Persia. The Soviet Government is represented as wanting nothing more from the Persians than a concession similar to that of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company. 3. A statement along the lines of paragraph 5 of your telegram No. 3 to New York in so far as it is still appropriate would greatly help to dispose of this conception# 4.

Repeated to Moscow, Washington, New York. 3 3 3 IMMEDIATE. SECRET. My telegram No. 425, paragraph 2. During Kavtardishze’s visit to Persia in [gp. undec: ?1944] and since then, the Soviet authorities have made a great point of benefits they were going to confer on Persia by asking for an oil concession. See for instance enclosure to Sir R. Bullard’s letter of October 26th, 1944, to Mr. Baxter. They have also made the point that the Soviet G-overnment would be more altruistic than a private oil company. It is worth emphasising that whereas the Soviet Government’s desiderata are precise and ingenuous, the obligations they would undertake and benefits they would confer remain nebulous and are Hechnical points which can be settled afterwards”. A private oil company would surely put in the forefront the precise obligations it would undertake and benefits it would confer. Compare for instance Kabul despatch No. 60 of 1936 and/- 2 ~ and Tehran despatch No. 539, 1936 from which it is clear that negotiations of Amiranian (repeat /miranian) oil concession were from the first discussing such points with the Governments concerned. Unless and until the Soviet Government make concrete offers such as are for i instance summarised in Tehran telegrams Nos. 8 and 10 1937, how can they be entitled to talk of benefits they will confer on Persia? If you have available a copy of the first offer made by the Shell Company to the Persian Government in 1943 this should afford a further interesting comparison with Soviet business methods, typical example of which is the contract for supply of machine guns by the.Persian Government which the Soviet authorities signed after their entry Into Persia. In this contract all mention of payment was conveniently omitted, 3. Again, the experience of Russiar^/Persian Caspian fisheries concession indicates that Persian Government would not be able to retain arty effective control of a joint oil concession unless conditions of Russian participation were very strictly defined and the right were retained to appeal to U.N.O. in case of their infraction. 4. In this connexion it is perhaps of interest that Minister of ' 7 ar told the Military Attachd to-day that the Persian Prime Minister’s 'counter proposals’’ were in fact the work of a Cabinet or sub-committee compose^ of Je'mral Firouz (Minister of Co;nr' ,r ' ; ^ c+ - ? ons), Bayat /Bayat (minister of finance), Sepehr (I'inister of Commerce and Industry) and Bahar (Hinister of Education) all well known Russophiles. T' r inister of ^ar was convinced that Persian Prime Minister did not insist on any safeguards or hold language to the Soviet Ambassador which he claims to have done in his conversation with me. In short, Minister of w ar suspects the Persian Prime Minister of having 'sold the pass'. But even if he has, he can hardly deliver the goods until a new Majlis is elected and repeals the existing law on oil concessions - and this cannot happen until Russian troops have left.

Alekseev called 'Predatory Plans of Iranian Reaction arres', its first in a series of articles dealing with Persian question. Pull text has been broadcast by Moscow radio and is doubtless available to you. Following is sumraary; article empnasises that fro i very first days of its existence Soviet State tried to establish friendly relations with Persia as witness its statements of January 1 9 18 and June 1919. and Soviet-Persian Treaty of February 26th. 1921 in all of readiness to contribute to Persian political and economic development as independent country. Article adds that 1921 Treaty still lies at tfeo .0 01 Soviet-Persian relations and stresses that Soviet renunciation of her rights, privileges, etcetera «8s all the more important because it took place at. time 'vhen Persia was virtually under British occupation and /contributed 2 ((ARMS tow-matm \VJ - 2 - contributed to her liborstion and recognition as an ino.ependent state. 3. But instead of showing gratitude and following path of friendly relations with Soviet Union, ruling circles in Persia came out with predatory claims to Soviet terri tory e.g, in Persian memorandum of March 1919 to Paris Peace Conference. Head of Persian Government at that time was Samsam -s Saltana who had made Treaty of Friendship between Britain and Bakhtaris in 1916 and .had allowed British troops to occupy Persia in 1918 and to move across Persia to Baku and Ashabad. Persian memorandum claimed over 570 thousand square kilometres of territory including Azerbaijan, Soviet Armenia, part of Dagestan and Transcaspian Oblast as far north as Komsomolsts Gulf and as far east as Amudarya. Article adds that these claims were not advanced without foreign encouragement and if realised would have deprived Soviet Union of oil. 4. Although these claims were not considered at Peace Conference it was no accident that they were put forward, because certain Persian statesmen have always aimed at bringing Soviet Union into collision with other great $ powers in order to use situation to realise their pre datory plans against her. For instance Hakimi who was in Government in 1919 and who partly inspired its pre datory plans was Prime Minister in 1945 and until February 1946, and poisoned atmosphere of Soviet-Persian relations. Foreign agent Seid Ziya Ud Din who is trying /torr - 3 - to undermine Soviet-Persian relations and cause friction betY/een Britain and Soviet dnion has also begun to play prominent part in politics. People like these v/ho still have much influence on Persian foreign policy know they cannot achieve-their territorial aims themselves and are ttherefore trying to bring Soviet Union into conflict with other great powers. In 1941 when Germany attached Soviet Union Persian ruling circles began to intrigue vdth her and there was Chauvinist talk of seizing Soviet Azerbaijan and ether areas. All this calls for vigilance on part of Soviet Union towards these ruling circles and their plans, 5. Author says that in his next article he will deal v/ith oil concessions in Persia v/hich also clearly reveal foreign policy of Persian ruling circles and their atti tude tov^ards Soviet Union.

North Persian oil. There is no doubt that the Russians are determined to secure the oil of North Persia. Attitude of His majesty's Government is that they have no objection provided that concession is granted by Persian Government freely and not under pressure, Ky impression about the Americans has hitherto been that they did not much care what happened in the North so long as they could secure concession in the South but I am inclined to revise this impression in view of [2 gps. undec.] upon the Persia question by American representative in the Security Council. Persians on the whole are much afraid of Russian political penetration behind the shield of exploitation of oil but have not the courage to hold out indefinitely without assistance. 2. The oil question was touched upon informally when I saw the Prime Minister on 3rd February. T said that if the Russians raised it the Persian Government might find that flttCo. POL DEPti | 0 I INDIA OFFICE !- 2 - that the problem presented itself in this form: [Begins] The T/orld needs oil and Russia says she needs this oil. Persia could do rith the royalties. It is possible that it v:ould be uneconomic to export surplus oil from North Persia except to Russia. On the other hand exploitation of a concession by one state in the territory of another would present a problem without precedent. [Ends] I suggested (and I made it clear that it was a purely personal suggestion) that Persia if confronted with such a problem might submit it to the United Nations and ask for advice in the interests of all concerned. 3. The Prime Minister professed to be greatly inter ested and said that he hoped whenever the question was raised he might be allowed to ask for advice of His Majesty's Government, 4. I trust you will approve the line I took. I felt that if Persian negotiators in Moscow were confronted with a secret demand for oil and had no policy they might give some kind of promise which would atleast bind them all personally. If ohe Persians have to negotiate an oil concession with Russia unaided they will undoubtedly be compelled to grant (a) financial terras such as will leave Russians a large margin of profit for propaganda including competition in welfare work which Mnglo-Iranian. however* zealous and sincere their efforts might be unable to meet and (b) actual if not nominal control of exploitation of concession which would eventually establish the Russians in a dominating position first in the concession area and then inin the country generally. On the other hand if the Persians simply refuse to allow Northern oil to be exploited they may incur serious criticism. .appeal to U.N.O. for advice seems to roe the only safe policy.
