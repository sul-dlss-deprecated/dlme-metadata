Appointment of a Security Officer for Arab Shore of Persian Gulf.°fo&lt; Confidential ♦ TH\3 iir, ■ n d* 0 # No* Office of the Political heeident, in the Pereian Gulf, Caup, Khorramshahi. 26th July, 1942. I have been asked opinion whether any Security- Officer is required for the Arab side of the Gulf. The natural headquarters of such an officer would be Bahrain and his chief duty would be to assist the Political Agents in keeping track of enemy agents. The officer would be appointed by and be responsible to the C.I.C.I. 2. Vy own view at present is inclined to be that though there are rmny pro-Nazi sympathisers an the Arab shore of the Gulf, tliere are few if any enemy agents and that the services of a Security Officer are not requii ed. On the scther hand if we refuse the services of such an officer ~e increase our own responsibility for watching enemy 4gents and taking action against them. 3. In the light of the above please let me know whether you consider the appointment of a Security Officer for the' Arab shore of the Gulf (a) necessary (b)desirable (c) otiose. . 4.

Some cargo for the island may be on these cargo ships and may have to be unloaded at SlidJw 2. The chief problem v.hich arises is the control of coolie labour v/orgin^ on ships. At the moment thesfe coolies do not carry a p^.ss. The difficulties which arise end whioh have b-en discussed with local authorities are: - The coolies are not in regular employment but are engaged as shipping a rives, by contractors. b. To limit the number of coplies to re^ularl; employed ^angs mijht result in holdin 0 up shipping About b ships is considered to be the maximum number likely to have to be worked at a time, but the port sometimes has no ships in at all. Ships are worked continuously day and night and allowin for relief ann of coolies, 630 is the maximum number likely to be involved at one time. The solution appeai-s to be in the use of metal discs, to be, issued as required to coolie .contractors, and withdrawn aiien work ceases. I Pises are not available here and if made up by loc 1 tinsmiths could, be easily imitated. Paper passes are not considered suitable as the hijh humidity causes excessive sweatin^ amongst coolies, and the paper pass would have vary short life, Co-ild these be made in Iraq. If of tin it is su ^ested that a shape ocher than circular be used, as circALar discs ar^ used by BaPOO coolies. A/uiy identity discs v/ith a number stamped would be suitable. ' The rais in charge of the ^ang should have a pass ivith photograph. This pass should also be carried by ships agents. Pass forms are required for issue to these personnel. 50 Pass forms are required. 3. To nua;e the concrol effective a check must be instituted at the ^.ngvirays of ships. At che moment, coolies are searched when leaviiq. only, at the gate to the customs jetty. _.s many peopie, such as sailors on dhows, have access to the customs jetty this is not a desirable place for the concrol, v/hich will only oe effective if on the ships gangways. A permanent guard of levies or Special Defence Police on ships is therefore desirable, v/ith orders to examine discs and to search coolies entering and leaving; ships. This guard 'would not only be effective in preventing sabotage of shipping but would also prevent the pilferage, which, on a small scale, is occurring^ kastersof ships are of course responsible for providing a watch, but crew shortages ntkes this difficult for them and the sailors do not appear to search effectively. ,9 y ■2« JU n, h- only .hips vinitod by ths quanuatins toe tor ax*s mail stoankirs riwi those oarxyin^ sick ortsa rhe JVa* K*C*0« on Port duty has difficulty in ^sttin^ to other Teasels &lt;tus to lack of a la xioh. launch hi e is quite excess Its here, &gt; uneea fifty for a return trip to a ship at anchorage or Rupees K&lt;X&gt; per month.

Dhows arrived in the same period. Two were from Indian ports, (Details in Appendix A)* and the remainder from Gulf Ports. (Appendix B). Long distance dhows are visited and members of the crew interrogated. Search of these dhows is however difficult even if labour is available, as every inch of shipping space is full, and the dhow unloads slowly into rowin^ boats, and may take as long as 10 days to discharge its cargo, until which time the lower portion of the dhow is inaccesible. However all cargo must pass throuji Bahrein Customs on discharge. 3° Dhov/ sailors have been contacted who state that they made the journey to RANGOON and SU'JGAPOKtS before the war with JAPAN. Pew dhows did the trip, as the round journey took one year and crews did not like being away from their families for so long. 4. SDCUHITY OP THH AIRPORT. Land aircraft use the aerodrome at MOHARHAQ, the security of wii^ch is an R.u»-P. responsibility. British Airways ^ personnel ^oin^ out to meet aircraft travel together and know each other well. However it is su^ested that they should carry a pass for production to the R.A.P. watchman. Sea planes alight near the R.A.P. jetty at MANAMA. A sentry is reccommended on the jetty to ins &gt;ect passes of personnel jeing out to the aircraft. The possibility of a sentry on the actual aircraft haslbeea considered. A sentrfcr to guard the diplomatic mail inside the aircraft would be of advantage, but the prospect of a native sentry inside the aircraft when refuelling is jDing on is not welcomed by British Airways. Personnel of the A.1.0. C. bar^ps which O oes out to refuil aircraft should carry passes, which should be inspected prior to departure of the barge. 5* Sailors from ships frequently come ashore without permission, chiefly from SITRA. It is understood that they hail passing fishin^, vessels, who put them ashore at MjHARHAQ, or come in boats belonging to the ships. It is suggested that masters be instructed not to allow their personneel to land, unless previous permission has been obtained from the BuJLIilN authorities. Toi D. g« 0. C. I. G. I. , Iraq. S. C. 0.

The two previous cases of bullion sale have been cleared up as a result of a further case. 2. At about 1700 hrs. 19 Feb. information was received that an R.A.F. sergeant was selling bullion to one SAID the jeweller, trading at the shop of SHUBATH and S. WlMAN, MANAMA, who , together with other merchants, was buying it. I proceeded at once to rd^F. Station WDHA.aiAQ and contacted the security officer. Together we returned to the Manama Bazaar and saw a sergeant answerin 0 to the description received leaving-the bazaar near to Manama Police Station. He was accompanied by two other Poles. Taken inside the Police Station he was asked to declare how much money he was carrying and warned that he would be searched. He xrroduced Rs.8000. He was informed that he had been under observation when in the bazaar and admitted selling English gold sovereigns to the value of Rs. 6000. He was informed that under BAHREIN Law people leaving the island were only allowed to take Rs. 1000 in cash. The R»^F* accounts officer was obtained and the man No, 792245 Sgt. SCIBID of 1. A. D. b. Cairo paid him Rs. 7000 for credit to his account. He handed Rs. 1000 to another Pole and produced another Rs. 1050 which he said was not his own and which he would take out of the island as his own quota. He made the attached statement concerning his financial transactions. He proved willing under interrogation, saying that he bought the gold at L*E*4PT 50 per sovereign, in Cairo and sold it at Rs. 6l in Bahrein. He did not remember the prices for the Inoian ingots saying that there was a lot of fluctuation. He admitted to the two previous incidents, and hotly denied having been in American uniform on 3 Feb. I am inclined to believe him on this. The Polish eagle he wears in his cap could be mistaken for an American eagle and may have confused source, but the confusion about the jacket and stripes which lead to the mistaken identification of FSRI4LL appears inex^ii^ble. 3. As a result of the interrogation I am of the opinion that the case is a simple one of the man trying to make a profit on the varying rates of O old in diffe ent countries and that no subversive activity is involved.

Dear Sir: / Please refer to your letter No.C/1411 of October 1, 1944, requesting a report on the accident that occured September 21, 1944, on the tug Calkhobar I quote below a report given me by my principals in Arabia which information I hope will explain «e&gt; what actually happened in this matter: The accident occured on September 21, 1944, at approximately 12:10 p.m. The ^ALKHOBaR” had arrived from Arabia, at Zellaq Terminal, towing the oil barge 'DAHANA'. The barge was berthed at the inner wharf for unloading and the tug had moved off to anchor at a position several hundred yards from the barge, when the tug reached the mooring point, the starboard air receiver in the engine ro^m exploded. The explosion caused damage to the engine room, and A the wheel house of the tug. It also caused the instant death of: Doctors in the employ of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd. were called to examine the deceased and treat the injured. The latter were removed to the Mission Hospital in Manama. The deceased was transferred from the tug 'CALKPiOBAR' to a company launch and returned to Saudi Arabia for burial. Preliminary investigation indicated that the air tank failed because of defective steel and had apparently burst at a pressure below that at which the safety valves were set. Since the accident the safety valves have been tested and found to release within the acceptable limites for specified working pressure of the tank. w/sile in Bahrein waters which resulted in the death of a Saudi Arab subject.

Results are summarised below. In the first test to place delay bombs in the Hain Power House , the saboteur, having gained entrance, was unable to place his bombs owing to observation! by one of the staff employees.

In the next two tests bombs were planted in tne Distillation Plant, the Gas Recovery Plant and again in the Main Power House. Thanks to the vigilance of the btaff Employees, all Lhese bombs were discovered before th ey were due to explode,if' these sabotage attempts would thus have been complete 1allure » 2. INCIDENTS. On 12 Nov at 1500 hrs (approx) a tank containing a mixture of Kerosine and petrol caught fire in the Lead Treating Plant» There s no evidence to show the cause, though static electricity has been advanced as a possible theory, however it would have been difficult to devise a delay to use in igniting this tank, and combustion was slow, proving that it started near the surface of the mixture, had it been ignited from above from a light thrown in, an explosion snould have occurred. This taxik should not have been chosen by a saooteur as it was dovnw'ind of other tanks and the fire would now spre^M. Analysis was unfortunately not possible in ihis case, and it is not possible to give any definite indication of the cause. This incident was followed by a fire at the Loading r;amp, cau by flame from the exhaust of a tractor which was being leaded igniting the gas. The cause of this was obvious and sabotage or malicious damage is not suspected. The Arab driver oi the tractor was killed. 3 .TRANSFORMER STATIONS. The gate on tjie Transformer near to uhe Refinery Cilice has oi reported to have been unlocked on two occasions. SECURITY OF DOCUMENTS.
