Most of the file consists of minutes of conferences that took place at the Foreign Office during July and August 1921. These conferences involved an Egyptian delegation, led by Sir Adly Yeghen [Yakan] Pasha, and the British, led by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord George Nathaniel Curzon. Matters covered in these meetings included: the termination of the British Protectorate, Britain's military presence, foreign relations, legislation, employment of foreign officials, financial and judicial control, Soudan [Sudan], the Suez Canal, communication rights, protection of minorities, retirement and compensation of British officials, and diplomatic relations between the two countries.Also contained within the file are minutes by Ronald Charles Lindsay and John Murray, both Foreign Office officials, and correspondence between Curzon, Lindsay, Adly Pasha, and Field Marshal Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby, High Commissioner for Egypt and Sudan. These papers all concern matters covered by the negotiations.Documents of note include a copy of the Report of the Special Mission to Egypt, dated 9 December 1920 (folios 4-23), and a memorandum on the political situation in Egypt by John Murray, dated 4 January 1923 (folios 74-87).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Prime Minister</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Egypt</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001491.0x000296#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001491.0x000296#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
