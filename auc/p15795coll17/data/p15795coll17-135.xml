He outlines how he came to study of the Middle East via early academic work on and research in West Africa, and how he joined AUC.  Hopkins describes the Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology, and Egyptology Department and its units, including faculty, program origins, facilities on the old campus, and its graduates. He speaks about his own anthropological fieldwork in Egypt and other academic interests, as well as more generally what it was like to perform social science research in Egypt. Hopkins recounts his work with AUC’s Social Research Center in the late 1970s and early 1980s, discussing its research projects, leadership and research personnel, and organizational challenges in those decades and beyond. His position as Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences between 2000 and 2004 is covered, with observations on its various departments and the  development of related units like the Middle East Studies Center, Forced Migration and Refugee Studies, and American Studies. He addresses faculty issues like research, recruiting and hiring, compensation, tenure and promotion, the role of department chairs, and academic freedom (and related matters like the government’s prosecution of Saad Eddin Ibrahim in the 2000s). Developments in the Core Curriculum are detailed, and students receive attention, including issues like cheating and grades. Hopkins also speaks about the planning for AUC’s new campus, for which he discusses matters like transportation and the proposal for a mosque on campus. Hopkins served terms as Chair of the Faculty in the 1970s and of the University Senate in the 1990s, and he details the functions and operation of those bodies, as well as related administrative committees on matters like tenure, personnel, and curriculum. He discusses the discrepancy in salary and retirement age between Egyptian and American and other foreign faculty and the activity in those areas in the 1990s, as well as faculty relations with Presidents, trustees, and other administrators more generally. Hopkins offers a portrait of his residence in Egypt across five decades, recalling notable events and aspects of life like the poor communications technology in the 1970s, and describing changes in his neighborhood of Maadi. He also mentions aspects of the career at AUC of his wife Ferial Ghazoul, faculty member in the Department of English and Comparative Literature, and he comments on the role of women among the faculty and administration.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>oral histories</dc:type><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017; American University in Cairo.
