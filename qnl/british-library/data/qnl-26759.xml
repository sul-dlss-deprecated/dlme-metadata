Apart from the foregoing, Their Lordships concur with you that the Persians have no right to interfere with Arab shipping for Customs or any other purposes outside their own territorial waters, and They do not think it likely that the Persians are under any serious misapprehension as to the rights they possess since several protests have already been made against Persian interference with Arab shipping on the high seas for Customs purposes* Their Lordships think it improbable that the Persians will endeavour to claim rights similar to ours to search for arms on the high seas of the Gulf, since their policy for some considerable time has been to endeavour to secure for themselves the sole right to supervise Persian shipping, leaving the remainder to the British Navy* BY COMMAND OF THEIR LORDSHIPSr SECRET S 3S3S SB SBSS 3B s ae COPY OF TELEORAM. . &amp; ■ Jv,£ FROM,•C~ln-C», East Indies, ^ TO,,,, Admiralty.

So long as we claim rights in connection with the suppression of arms traffic (? in the) Persian Gulf ourselves, there may be difficulties in denying some such rights to Persian war vessels, but we are on very firm ground in denying any rights at all on the high seas for the purpose of suppressing smuggling.

Sir, With reference to recent correspondence on the subject of the Arms Traffic Convention, I would invite attention to the prod action and notification published in 1898 by the Rulers of Muscat ( Treaties and Undertakings in force between the British Government and the dultans of Muscat A Cc) and * Oman 1840-1914, page 17, Nos. 8 (a ) and 8 (ba, Bahrain W* (similar publication in respect of Bahrain, 1820-1914, page 11, Hos. 9 (b) and 9 (c)), and Kuwait (similar publication in respect of Kuwait, 1841-1913, page 3, Noe. 3 (b) and 3 (c)). The proclamation published by the Buitan of Muscat has been brought to notice by the Indie Office, vide India Office letter No. P.^. 7333/32, dated 6th jJecember 1 to the Foreign Office. My records here do not show, however, that the fact of similar proclamations having been published by the Rulers of Bahrain and Kuwait has been commented on.- 2 - . ' r ,L ^ ' (-i* .Lg *.'1'' 2. The proclamation and notification published by the Sultan oi* Muscat resulted from the Agreement of lay? between the British and Persian Governments - vide the Sadr-i-Azam’s letter to Mr# G# Hardinge, dated 18th December 18^7# I have not been able to find in my archives the full correspondence regarding that Agreement and would be glad to learn the Persian rights thereunder# I have, however, on my records the original of a letter dated 4th January 1898 from the Sadr-i- / zam to the Sultan of Muscat, transmitted through His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, (Tehran despatch to Bushire, Wo.l, of 6th January 1898), aaicing the Sultan to prohibit his subjects from importing arms from Muscat into Persian ana Indian ports, and to accord British and Persian war vessels the right of search in Muscat territorial waters. It y^ls apparently undelivered as the style of address was considered unsuitable and as the Sultan had in the meantime published the proclamation and notification referred to. 3# The Muscat proclamation - 8 (;) - accords to Brit is! and Persian war vessels the autnority to search in Muscat territorial waters vessels flying the British, the Persian or tne Muscat flag, and the right to search in Indian and Persian waters vessels flying the Muscat flag, as well as certain rights of confiscation# It does not accord the right of search on the High Seas. t 4# The Muscat notification, after prohicit*n G the traffic in arms between Muscat and India and Persia, reads as follows H In future our Muscat flag will be no protection to vessels carrying the said arms and ammunition from our/ mrt our Dominions to Indifc and. Persia”. As stated in paragraph 2 above, I am not clear as to the rights of Persia under the Agreement of 18y7, but it is possible that the Persian Government might claim that the passage confers the right of search of Muscat vessels on the High Seas. Tile Bahrain - 9 (b) - and Kuwait -3(b)- proclamationa accord the same rights in respect of the vessels and waters of the notifying Ruler as the Muscat proclamation - 8 (a). The Bahrain - 9 (c) - and Kuwait - 3 (c) - notifi- Cc-1i ons, however, merely forbid the importation and exportation of arms and ammunition into and from the territory of the notilying Ruler and state that arms and ammunition so imported or exported will be seized and confiscated. They do not contain the passage quoted in paragraph 4 above from the Muscat notification. The Muscat proclamation and notification resulted from the Agreement of 1897 between the British and Persian Governments, and the Persian Government specifically asked i or the co-operation of the Muscat Government. In the case of Bahrain and Kuwait however, though it is apparent that the action was consequent on the British-Persian Agreement of 1897, the Persian Government does not - so far as I can trace from my records - appear to have been consulted. 7# The held at present . vide paragraph 4 of the Instructions (illicit Arms Traffic) concerning the search of dhows by H. .hhips in the Persian Gulf for Arms,( enclosure to i oreign Office despatch to Tehran, Bo. 499 , dated 2nd September 1931) - is that the Persian Government would repudiate the Agreement// Agreement of 1897 if it were brought to their notice* If they did this they could not claim any rights thereunder. It is possible, however, that should the .. ersian Government remember the existence of these proclamations, they might prefer - now that they have t 'navy' - to enjoy the rights conferred thereby rather than repudiate the Agreement of 1897. 8* On the other hand there would, I imagine, ze no Kuwait and Bahrain difficulties in persuading Ithe Rulers of/to cancel their pro clamations, since under present circumstances,i•e. with a Persian fleet in being, they certainly would not relish the right of search granted to Persia by these documents. In the case of Muscat the letter from the 3adr-i-Aaam was - as stated above - apparently never actually delivered to the Sultan, and in any case the Sultan’s proclamation was of a unilateral character, and could presumably be annulled by him at will. The same remarks would seem to apply to the Bahrain and Kuwait proclamations. One possible objection to the cancellation of these proclamations would, however, be, not from the Persian point of view, but ours, since the abolition of the Persian, would also mean that of the British, right of search, for both are included in the same document. 9. The Trucial Chiefs’ notifications published in 1902 merely prohibited tne importation of arms for sale into their territories, or the exportation therefrom.
