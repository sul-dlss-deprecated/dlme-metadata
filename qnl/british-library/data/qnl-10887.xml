Muna (Mina) is a station of the hadj, where pilgrims camp out on the 8th, 11th, 12th (and some on the 13th) of
                           Dhul-Hijjah, as can be seen in this image.See Photo 174/9 for a comparative view from a similar vantage point but with a closer view of the Masjid al-Khayf, which here appears in the left of the background. The structure to the right of the iwan-like entryway, which appears damaged in the latter view, here appears intact. In the far middle ground at right two and three-storey structures can be seen. A ridge of hills rises along the horizon.The middle ground is occupied by tents, while in the foreground there are a wide variety of beasts of burden, such as horses, camels and donkeys, standing, tethered or couched.The negative has had hand-work applied, creating a drawing-like quality, particularly in the background, where the original plate may have been over-exposed.Arabic script written directly into the image has been erased subtly, but is visible upon close inspection in the lower right of the image as well as in the central sky area of the image.This is the first of two photographs taken from the same vantage point, which form a panoramic view over the valley. The second is X463/12.Inscriptions:Above image, on the right, in ink: ‘X’Temporal Context:According to Durkje van der Wal in his publication
