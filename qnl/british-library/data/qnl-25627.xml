I HAV E tlie honour to inform yon that I proceeded to Paris in accordance with instructions received on the 1st August. On arriving in Paris I met M. Picot, who introduced me to M. Eddeh, a Christian Arab, of Beirout, who is a commissaire in the French navy. M. Eddeh left the island of Er-Kuad, off the coast of Northern Syria, on the 1st July. He had been on shore on the mainland and travelled considerably in the interior in the early summer, and was in close touch with the interior situation in Syria and Northern Palestine up to the time he left. M. Eddeh impressed me as a very sober-minded man and not inclined to exaggerate. He stated that the situation of the Turkish Government was precarious in Syria, and that the Christians and Moslem Arabs had come together in a most surprising way owing to misery and oppression. He remarked that there had never, even at the first outbreak of the Young Turk revolution in 1908, been such a rapprochement between the people of the two religions. There had been no actual outbreak of rebellion in Syria up to the time when he left, but the situation was only kept in hand by the Government striking hard at those leaders they could lay their hands on and paying large subsidies to those they could not, viz., country chiefs and religious leaders on the coast and the Bedouin Sheikhs of the Syrian desert. The misery and want he described as existing in all parts was very terrible, especially in the Lebanon. He estimated that of the Maronites perhaps 60,000 old men, women, and children had perished of artificial famine produced by seizure of crops. The present harvest, he said, was good, but congestion and confusion made it difficult to distribute. As regards the Shereef of Mecca’s rebellion, it was well received, and the Syrians hoped to join in when opportunity offered, but were handicapped by want of organisa tion and by the general confusion and poverty which existed.

CUMBERBATCH, formerly His Majesty’s consul-general at Beirout, brought Dr. Hoskyns, head of the American Mission there, to see me yesterday. Dr. Hoskyns left Beirout on 29th June last. His description of the situation was appalling, and confirms all our reports : the people of the Lebanon and the Syrian Moslems subjected to an absolutely ruthless reign of terror, since eight months ago, and being starved to death. A conservative estimate was 80,000 in the Lebanon killed in this way when Dr. Hoskyns left, and the rate of deaths was growing by geometrical progression. All the leading men deported, hanged, or in exile, with their properties confiscated and their relations in the hands of the Turks. Dr. Hoskyns attributed some 100 death sentences to the information found by the Turks in the archives of the French consulate, and said that local feeling, hitherto ardently pro-French, had received a shock such as to destroy all faith and trust in France. Between Damascus, Beirout, and the Lebanon the Turkish forces are estimated at from 30,000 to 50,000. I asked Dr. Hoskyns what practical measures of relief there were for these wretched people, and he ha.d to confess that really there w r ere none, short of a successful advance from Mesopotamia or Mecca, or an expedition from Beyrout or Alexandretta, and the Turks had made elaborate preparations against the latter contingency. Dr. Hoskyns, his wife, and two daughters suffered most unpleasant indignities when crossing from Germany into Denmark, and generally had the experiences of neutral travellers. He said the most serious want of all in Germany was lack of milk. Two young invalided German officers travelled with him in the “ Balkan-Zug.” They told him it was useless their going home for a cure: they had had dysentery, and needed a milk diet, but could not get it, as there were no children in their families.

The Noyak (Ccilcuttci) of the 5th July can see Lord Hardinge 5 s hand The Arab revolt. behind the Arab revolt. But whoever may be responsible for the thing the news ought not to have been published m India so soon. Medina is still besieged and the issues of the struggle have not been decided yet. The publication of the news, therefore has only created some unrest among the Musalman community. Indeed no news ought to be circulated in India until Government is in possession of all details The paper also objects to the publication in India of Lord Hardinge’s boast of having for a time kept only 15,000 soldiers in India. The Musalman community, continues the Nay ok, ought not to have shown such excitement over the Arab revolt. Indeed, those members of the Moslem community who are m the habit of holding meetings and joining agitations, are making a great ado^over the question, though the masses of the Musalman population know nothing of the Arab revolt and perhaps care nothing for it. Besides, there can be no reason for questioning the propriety of the action of the Sherif of Mecca, who is a devout Musalman. The result of this agitation has been to create a split among the Musalman community. 2. The Mohammadi (Calcutta) of the 7th July has the following iind. . Along with the news of the declaration of independence by the Sherif of Mecca we are being told that Turkish misgovernment is the cause of the Arab revolt and that henceforward pilgrimage to Hedjaz will be unattended with any danger or difficulty, and the most curious thing of all is that this revolt has given, will give, and ought to give great satisfaction to Indian Musalmans. As soon as the news of the revolt was published a few great souls of the Khan Bahadur class expressed intense elation and said, “ Well done, well done, nothing better was ever done.” Journalists who know nothing about the laws of Islam, of the religious feeling of Musalmans, pulled down the Sultan from the Khalifate and installed the Sherif in his place. Criminal Investigation Department officers began to run about to ascertain the mind of the Musalman public. All India stirred with commotion. With the exception of a few “ Musalmans of light and leading ” who hanker after appendages to their names, all Musalmans were thunderstruck by the news and tears flowed from their eyes; but they could not open their lips. The laments we heard that evening among the devoted in the Bara Masjid, their eyes turned towards heaven and their general air of dejection, moved us. We saw an old grey-bearded venerable Musalman looking up to the sky and exclaiming, “The idols are saying in the temples ‘ the Moslems are gone for goodthey are glad that the protectors of the Kaaba are gone (and they say) ‘ from the earth have disappeared those who sang beside the camels (the expression £ those who sang beside the camels,’ means the guides who show the way to the pilgrims on their way to the holy places), they have gone with Korans under their arms.’ The infidel is laughing, O God. Do you not feel for Islam ?” Tears were trickling down his grey beard as he said this. In fact, the news of the Arab revolt did not at all give satisfaction to the Musalmans. On the contrary, many of them were greatly grieved and agitated over it. Many questions are now agitating the mind of the Musalmans, such as that the revolt will irretrievably destroy the centre of Musalman political p ow er, that the feelings of the Musalmans will be grievously wounded if fight ing occurs in the sacred places, that internecine quarrels will arise among Musalmans, that it will be impossible for the Sherif to save himself unaided from the Turkish Powers, that the consequence will be most deplorable and the peace of the sacred places will be destroyed, etc. In fact the news of the Arab revolt has not given and cannot give satisfaction to any true Musalman. Thanks to the leaders of the All-India Moslem League and a hundred thanks to that great man of Lucknow, Maulana Abdul Bari, who first declared that the Arab revolt under the leadership of the Sherif of Mecca deserved the severest condemnation, that the revolt was likely to defile the holy places of Hedjaz and Mesopotamia and that the rebels and their sympathisers were the enemies of Nayak, July ith, 1916 Mohammath, July 7th, 191 /£\ f962 Moslkm Hitaisiii, July 7th, 1916. Chahu Minm July 4th, 1916. Nava*. Juij 4th, 1916. Islam. The Musalmans of Calcutta, in a large meeting, openly endorsed the views of that body. Two Khan Bahadurs of Madras named Dalji and Lalji and an unknown great man of Calcutta have asserted in the newspapers that the Sherif has, by declaring his independence, shown the path of salvation to the Musalman race and particularly the Indian Musalman pilgrims—no longer will pilgrims to Hedjaz be oppressed or inconvenienced. But the question is, who are mainly responsible for the oppressions to which pilgrims to Hedjaz have been sub jected up to now ? If the truth must be told the responsibility must be fastened on the Sherif himself and his assistants, the Bedouin robbers of Hedjaz. The Turkish Government appointed the Sherif to his post on a large salary to look after the interests of the pilgrims and maintain order in Hedjaz. It is solely owing to the presence of Arab robbers that there can be no police supervision, no water-supply, no extension of railways, no establishment of industries and no administration of justice according to law in Arabia, and that pilgrims to Hedjaz lose their property and lives. The Turks have more than once tried to remedy this state of affairs, but have not been able to do so owing to the opposition of the Sherif and the Arab leaders. Hitherto the Sherifs used sometimes to be called to account for their misdeeds and some Sherifs have even been punished and dismissed, but henceforward they will not be accountable to anybody for their conduct. If this revolt succeeds, the Sherif will become master of Arabia for the present, and the depredations of the Bedouin robbers will gradually increase. 3. The Moslem Hitaishi (Calcutta) of the 7th July writes :— Nothing definite can as yet be said about the fuLI1 ^ h M Arah revr,It aild lurKe% s Arab revolt, and though news of the event has comd from various places nothing has been heard from Hedjaz. Most of the reports we are receiving come from Egypt. The account of the success attained by the Sherif may be somewhat exaggerated, but it cannot be altogether baseless. The Arabs have for a long time been anxious to throw off the Turkish yoke and they have seized the present opportunity to accomplish their object. Though the Sherif of Mecca may take possession of Hedjaz, the Turks will try their best to retake it sooner or later. Along with Hedjaz the province of Yemen is about to be lost to Turkey. If the Arabs of Syria and Mesopotamia now rise against Turkey her condition will be very pitiable indeed: The Arabs now form by far the largest portion of the subjects of the Ottoman Empire, and if they stand against Turkey she will be in a very desperate position. But will she easily abandon her rights ? If she does so, the revered Sultan of Turkey will be reduced to a condition worse than that of the Shah of Persia or the Amir of Kabul. There is very little chance of Turkey being able to do anything against the Sherif of Mecca at present, for it, as thev are sure to be, the Arabs are well provided with munitions, it will be very difficult to defeat them. The hardships which the present war has brought upon Hedjaz pilgrims are in a large measure responsible for the Arab revolt. f II— Home Administration. x . ' (#)— Police. 4. The Charu Mihir (Mymensingh) of the 4th July hopes that Govern- Auarchicai crim-g. ment will not listen to the advice of the Statesman and other papers regarding the measures to be taken to put down anarchism in Bengal, for if it does, it will only affect the welfare of the Empire. Ihe main object of the newspapers above referred to is to injure the interests and to thwart the progress of the people of this country, and the journal invites Government s attention to the mischief which they are doing. 5.

In our opinion, this should rather debar a man from election. A man who goes to the Council must be able to fight fearlessiy for privileges If it is the intention of Government to elect persons who hold views acceptable to officials, then what was the necessity for introducing Lord Morleys Council reform? Apparently the object of the introduction of the Council reform was nothing but to give the public a lamer s lare m the administration of the country, so that the officials may know more thorough y the sentiments of the people and thereby strengthen the founda- S °n t ie Er ?P. ire - When tbis is intention of Government, is it not the duty of the public to co-operate with it? There was indeed a time when Government^ could get some work out of those people who were known as ^ Jlhuzoors, ,, but the exigencies of the times require that the members in the Councils should be able to offer their views on financial and educational problems which come up for discussion. 87. The Sadaqat (Calcutta) of the 5th July, in referring to the strictures The E^i^n and the All- s ? d b y the En f^nan upon the attitude of the India Moslem League. Moslem League towards the Sherif of Mecca, says:— We have already conclusively shown that the question of the protection of the holy places in the Hedjaz and Arabia is a purely religious one and has no connection with any political movement whatsoever. Is it not presump tuous on the part of the Englishman to meddle with the religious questions of the Moslems? Would not the Englishman consider it impertinent on our part if we plunged ourselves into a controversy, say, for instance, about the appointment of the Archbishop of Canterbury, simply because we are citizens of the Empire ? Such a step would be extremely ridiculous on our part; so the Englishman has also no right to interfere in a matter which only concerns the Moslems. We look with disgust at the attempt made by the Englishman to set Government against the Moslem League and the Lucknow Musalmans. The Moslem League has done nothing but express its apprehension about the holy places being placed in danger by the Sherif’s policy and hence has con demned his action and declared him to be an enemy of Islam. Can the Englishman point to a single Moslem from among the vast Moslem population of India who will look with indifference at the holy places being placed in danger and who does not see eye to eye with the Moslem League on this question ?81 The Sanjivani (Calcutta) of the 6th July, referring to the new Government loan, writes that some people hold “ Government loan.” there j s a l ar ge amount of hoarded money in the hands of Indians. Government ought to ascertain whether this is true, and if so, why it is not forthcoming when Government loans are floated. 82 ' The following is taken from an article which appears in the Nayak ' r (Calcutta) of the 4th July over the signature of The Nay ale s P o icy. Panchkari Banerjee, the editor of the paper :— \ ^ / We shall, as we have been doing these two years, unhesitatingly support almost every administrative measure, though, of course, we shall always speak the truth. ' We shall give preference to questions v/hich are conducive to the welfare of our rulers and our people alike. Considering the headway which anarchism has made of late, even persons who are in favour of peace and good government should now speak with some force. The time for indifferent silence is past, and one must now decisively take one side or the other. We heartily and fully take the side of the British nation and British rule. For three or four generations past we have been the subjects of the British Empire, and we feel extremely diffident about asking our English rulers for autonomy, especially in the face of the existence of the selfish Anglicised and luxury- loving creatures whom English education has brought into being. We should have been glad to get it if there were in Bengal now a true Brahmin like Maharaja Krishna Chandra of old. Since we are incapable of having self- government, the only course open to us is to adhere devotedly to the English; so we must support the Government in the present day of crisis. The Nayak will not deal with politics, literature, religion and society, but will discuss questions relating to agriculture, trade, etc. The proprietor of the paper has set apart a large area of land in the Bhagalpur district where respectable Bengali young men will be trained in agriculture. He has also opened a store for the sale of Ayurvedic drugs and herbs. 83. In referring to anarchist crimes, the Dainik Basumati (Calcutta) of u „ T1 t o „ the 5th July writes that by the misuse of their courage, determination, energy and resourceful ness the anarchists are jeopardising the political development of their country and creating a panic among their countrymen. English education has under mined the old social fabric based on the caste-system and brought about social disorganisation. Luxurious modes of living are inculcated, and when people find themselves unable to earn money honestly, they take to dishonest courses. The remedy for the evil lies in doing away with this godless svstem of education and substituting for it the old Hindu ideas of discipline and self-restraint. 84. The Bangali (Calcutta) of the 5th July regrets that the Indian Mirror, the paper of the late Rai Bahadur Narendra Nath Sen, has degenerated so far as to advise Government to apply the Press Act with greater stringency. “ A Daniel come to judgment!” There can certainly be no better adviser for Government than the Indian Mirror. Whatever the late Rai Bahadur may have done in his latter days, for the best part of his life he was a Champion of freedom and popular rights. To see the Indian Mirror grinning like a monkey now is like seeing the sublime reduced to the ridiculous. Who could imagine such a fall for the Indian Mirror ? This paper now perhaps thinks it can please Government and Englishmen by giving advice such as above. It does not know that by doing so it simply renders itself an object of contempt in their eyes, however that contempt may be disguised under the cloak of smiling approval. 85. The Bangali (Calcutta) of the 7th July writes that some Anglo- “ Misunderstood ' —The i„dia„ newspapers are surprised at the tone Press on the question of intern- acl opted by the Indian papers regarding police merit - assassinations. They hold that it is not consistent with our professions of loyalty to object, as we do, to the official measures to counteract sedition. They in fact hold that our professions of loyalty are a mere matter of policy and quite insincere. It is, The Indian Press Act.

We have got nothing to do with them. t Y? remember very well that the Englishman altogether disapproved of Lord Hardmge s action m regard to the Cawnpore Mosque, on the ground that it would have the effect of making the Moslems unruly. Let the Enalish- man remember that we too are the subjects of the British Empire and have earned the honour of having sacrificed our life and money for it. Under the circumstances we advise our contemporary that at a time when it is the dutv of every individual not to embarrass the people, it should not publish such irritating articles. In conclusion, we say clearly and distinctly that the question of the protection of the holy piacesfias nothing to do with the present war and the Young Turks. The Moslems of India have perfect confidence in the pledo-e given by the Government of India to respect the honour of the holy places. Hence the accusation which the Anglo-Indian papers have preferred against the Moslems, namely, that they are showing sympathy to the Young Turks is likely to cause misunderstanding. 5 88. The Mohammadi (Calcutta) of the 7th July has the following : “ Why this officious anxiety ? ” Our Anglo-Indian contemporaries are now up T , . ari d doing and trying their best to prove that the loslem League, the meeting in Lucknow, the meeting in Calcutta and similar held m connection with the recent Arab revolt are mere sham VV e think that officiousness is bad, especially as the less such subjects are discussed now the better. We for ourselves keep silent as much as we can, but are often compelled by the conduct of our contemporaries to open our lips reluctantly and speak the truth, which, however, is not always palatable This often puts us to great difficulty. The short-sightedness of the Statesman is likely to produce very bad results. We hear that arrangements are being made to hold mass meetings in all towns. The organisers say that the Anglo- Indian Press will not be satisfied till it is proved that the opinion of the Moslem League is the opinion of all Musalmans. We say, if there is any possibility of harm being done to our Government in this manner, do not do it. Let the Anglo-Indian Press say whatever it likes. A few days ago it patted the League and said, “ Bravo, Moslem League, you are a very good boy/ 7 But whenever the League clamours for anything—this piece of bread or that morsel of flesh,—it immediately assumes a different aspect. The people of this country will not be able to exist if they allow themselves to be disturbed by what the Anglo-Indian Press says. Our regret is, however, for the Basumati. This paper seems to have taken the brief against the League. It is characteris ing the work of the Musalman leaders as thoughtless and, in fact, making use of this opportunity to speak strongly against the Musalmans. We request our contemporary to confine himself to such topics as the murder of Basanta Babu, the question of arrests, the thoughtlessness of the anarchists, etc. The w r orld will not suffer in the least if the Basumati does not poke its nose into other people's affairs. No one need be told how perilous the condition of the Musalmans in the country has become in consequence of Turkey joining in the war. The people of the country know the extent of their connection with the Sultan of Turkey and their sympathy with the Turkish people, but praised be their unquestioning and unflinching loyalty. Even in this most critical tiroq they have proved by their work that Musalmans are really loyal. They do not say one thing and do another. They have not for political reasons professed sham loyalty. That is why they are sometimes rebuked for telling the truth frankly and speaking out their minds. Even their greatest enemies will admit that there is no hypocrisy in them, they do not understand conspiracy, there is no double-dealing on their part. 89. The Mohammadi (Calcutta) of the 7th July strongly condemns the “ The lethargy of the League' conduct of the Presidency Moslem League in not taking any interest in the burning social and political questions of the day which concern the Musalmans, such as pilgrimage to Hedjaz, the Indian Consolidation Bill, the Bongong affair and the Arab revolt. It ought to have told Government and the Musalmans what they should respectively do in the matter of pilgrimage to Hedjaz this year. It should have protested against the Indian Consolidation Bill.

God alone knows how this regrettable matter will end. 2.

The Mashriq (Gorakhpur) of the 4th July, 1916 (received on the 7th July), publishes Maulana Abdul Bari’s circular letter in which he refers with regret to the Arab revolt and suggests that a deputation of Indian Muhammadans should visit Mecca and enquire into the correctness of the news. . ex presses the hope that Government not being in any way concerned m wu kave no objection to the deputation going to Arabia and points out that the sanction of Government will remove any misapprehensions that may arise. ^ He says that no Muhammadan would like to see Mecca and Medina come under a non-Muslim Government. He reminds his readers of the assurances of the British Government to respect the sanctity of the holy places of Islam and says that it can be (reason- abiy) inferred from them that the British Government will respect the religious sentiments of Muhammadans. He says that the Sheriff is also a clever person and will not barter Islam for wealth. The editor observes that the suggested deputation will be useless when Indians can neither interfere with the war, nor bring about peace and when neither the Arabs nor the Turks will listen to them. He expresses confidence in the assurance given by Government that it will respect the sanctity of the holy places of Islam, and says that Government will not obstruct the deputation. He points out that it is the duty of Muhammadans to have consideration for the difficulties of Government and asks his co-religionists to consult the Government of India in the matter. He says that the deputation should consist of the JJlama only and suggests that the matter should be referred to the JJlama of Delhi, Lucknow, Deoband Lahore and Calcutta. The raising of money, he says, will not be a difficult matter. He remarks that Great Britain will be the first to prevent a non-Muslim power taking possession of the sacred places nor will the British Government want to bring them under its dominion. He enquires why certain individuals should take upon themselves the responsibility of the zeal of the Indian Muslim population who at present are under the belief that the war is between Muhammadans and Muhammadans.

The Advocate (Lucknow) of the 4th July, 1916, publishes an extract from the Bombay Chronicle on the subject ot the AraD revolt. The Chronicle says that the British Gov- ernment has pledged its word that it will not interfere with the sae [ el ? P'“ es and will do its utmost to protect them. That pledge has been and will be kep . Beyond that Muhammadans cannot and do not expect the Government to go. But they are naturally likely to resent the attempt on the part of irresponsib parties to interpose their views in a matter on which only Muhammadans have any right to express an opinion. The Advocate says “ There cannot be a better solace to our anxious Muhammadan brethren than that wherever the Union Jack flies, there religious peace reigns.” 6. In Al Bashir (Etawah) of the 4th July, 1916 (received on tbn 10th July), the editor refers to the comments ol tne The Arab revolt. statesman (Calcutta) and the Zeaeter (Allahabad) on the attitude of Indian Muhammadans at the revolt of the Sheriff of Mecca and says that it was with a view to warn Government that the Statesman pu is an incorrect report, that the Muhammadans of Calcutta welcomed the news ol me Arab independence, lest Government should under a misapprehension act in a manner that might have wounded the sentiments of its Muslim subjects. He says that it was malice that prompted the Leader to impute that amo the supporters of the Sheriff the Muslim League and other Muslim bodies incluaeu the British Government. swiff He points out that many Muslim leaders are supporters of the fene , among whom Bashid Baza, the editor of Al Manar, and Brince Sahab-u ^ He^points out that the Sheriff was not only a Turkish subject but was also in the pay of the Ottoman Government, and in order to keep peace in ra ia prevent the Beduins from plundering the Hedjaz pilgrims, was entrusted with o.

He says that notwithstanding the shortcomings of the Turks, they cannot he said to be wholly responsible for the disaffection of the Sheriff. He remarks that a revolt of the Arabs is nothing new as the Arabs have on several occasions tried to throw off the yoke of the Ottoman Government. He observes that it is because Islam condemns disloyalty to one’s Sovereign and because a tolerance of the disloyalty of the Sheriff will be a grave political error and will give agitators an opportunity to stir up disaffection among Indian Muslims against their Sovereign that the Muslims of India despise the Sheriff for acting against the teachings of Islam and moreover endangering the sanctity of the sacred places of Islam. He maintains that the Anglo-Indian newspapers and the Leader offer an insult to Government and seek to inflict a deep wound on Muslim sentiments when they say that the British Government is one of the supporters of the Sheriff. He remarks that at a critical time like the present nothing could be more mischievous or calculated to cause unrest among Muhammadans. He asks Government to declare that it is in no way concerned with Arab revolt and that it will preserve a policy of non-interference in matter. He urges his co-religionists to exercise patience and silence during period of their great trial. 7. The Musafir (Agra) of the 7th July, 1916, (received on the 10th July), refers to the Arab revolt and remarks that the action of the Sheriff of Mecca should be com mended by all loyal British subjects. The editor says that it was expected that all Indian Muslims would unani mously welcome the news, and wonders that the Muhammadans of Calcutta, Lucknow, Lahore and other places should express disapproval of the revolt. He deprecates the attitude of the Muhammadans. 8. The Cawnpore Gazette of the 8th July, 1916, (received on the 11th July), refers to the Arab revolt, and remarks that it The Arab revo , cause( j g rea t excitement among the Muham madans of India. The editor says that Indian Muhammadans have religious sympathy with the Turks because the Sultan of Turkey is the keeper of the sacred places of Islam, and if any Indian Muhammadan expresses gratification at the news of the Arab revolt, he is false. He says that the Indian Muham madans strongly protest against this revolt and he asks the British Government to observe a policy of non-interference. 9. In the Medina (Bijnor) of the 8th July, 1916, the editor gives a short history of Mecca and says that the shedding of blood The Arab revolt. or even ^ ( j es t ruc fci on 0 f trees is prohibited within a certain area out of reverence for the sanctity of the place. The invasion of Mecca therefore is a very painful affair for Muhammadans, and a person who causes mischief at that place or tolerates bloodshed or one who causes man-slaughter and oppression is a great sinner in the eyes of God and man. He remarks that since the Sheriff of Mecca cannot maintain his independ ence unassisted, he will have to remain subordinate to some other power or in bondage to some ruler under the control of the Christians. He remarks that as an Indian Muslim he desires peace in India and preservation of the sanctity of the sacred places of Islam. Since Indian Muslims cannot do anything themselves they have rely on Government to consider the religious sentiments of Mudammadans. He expresses the hope that the British Government will pay no heed to syco phants and will not would the religious sentiments of Muhammadans. 10.

( 626 ) censuring the action of the Grand Sheriff of Mecca for revolting against the Ottoman° Government, and says that it ill behoves the Statesman to refer contemptuously to the weakness of Indian Muhammadans. He says that the Muslim League only reminded the British Governmen' of the promises it made to respect the sanctity of the holy places of Islam. But it should not have done even that much, as “ Britain and Turkey are hostile countries and at the present moment every effort is being made to weaker* the power of the enemy. Then how can it.(British Government) be told to attack its enemy from the front and not from the side.” He asks—“ What offence was committed if a sigh escaped at seeing that certain evil-natured people have started to strike at the very root of Islam?” He remarks that his Calcutta contemporary has been guilty of inconsistency and he questions the veracity of the report that the Calcutta Muhammadans welcomed the news of the Arab revolt. He enquires what led the Statesman to make such a sweeping remark? 11. In the Nai Hoshni (Allahabad) of the 10th July, 1916, the editor continues his comments on the attitude of the Statesman (Calcutta) towards the demonstration of indignation by the Muslim League in regard to the Arab revolt. He ridicules his Calcutta contemporary for having stated that the resolu tions of the Muslim League aim at stirring up among Indian Muhammadans anti-British and pro-Turkish feelings. He points out that the sympathy of an Indian Muslim with the Turks is due to the fact that the latter are at the present moment the keepers of the sacred places of Islam, He says that every Indian Muhammadan feels for the Turks but at the same time he does not in the least desire that the Turks should beat the British. He decries the action of the Sheriff of Mecca and says that the Indian Muhammadans will remain uneasy so long as they are not assured that no danger menaces the sacred places of Islam. He remarks that it will be very impolitic to interfere with the sentiments of Indian Muhammadans when they are undergoing a great trial and specially as in their words and deeds they have never transgressed the bounds of strict loyalty. He asserts that he is not ashamed to own that he is a Muslim and a British subject, and he asks the Statesman to discontinue its articles on the subject. He remarks that those who imagine that Indian Muslims are anxious to stir up anti-Government feeling in India do them cruel injustice. 12. The Indian Daily Telegraph (Lucknow) of the llth July, 1916, The Arab revolt. agrees with a suggestion made by the Hon’ble Mr. Saiyid Baza Ali, in a letter to the editor, that an extraordinary session of the All-India Muslim League should be called at once to consider the situation arising out of the Arab revolt. The editor says that all responsible Muslim leaders recognise how neces sary it is to scrupulously observe the restraints imposed on them by the war, and to refrain from doing anything that might cause any undue public excite ment and embarrass Government. isolated public meetings held at various places are not free from certain nsks and it would be manifestly desirable if the Muslim leaders came to? gether to consider and formulate their views on the subject. •n, not only allay Muslim anxiety but also provide Government with an authoritative expression of Muslim opinion. He says that no one can question the devoted loyalty of the Indian Muhammadan community to the Grown or the natural solicitude of its leaders to say or do nothing that might havQi e slightest tendency to excite the people. He says that these considerations ave otmously inspired Mr. Baza All’s suggestion and it should be speedily acted upon in the interests of the community. 13.

It would relieve some of our worthy friends of the r61e which they have' gratui tously assumed of claiming to he our spokesmen.” In conclusion the writer gratefully acknowledges that since the outbreak or the war the policy of the British Government has been formulated with due regard to the religious beliefs of His Majesty’s Muslim subjects. 14. The editor of the Shamim (Jaunpur) in the issue of the 11th July, The Arab revolt. 1916, agrees with the Bombay Chronicle in regard to . the resolutions passed by the All-India Muslim League denouncing the Sheriff of Mecca and expresses surprise that the Anglo- Indian press should take upon itself to explain what is and what is not pleasing to the religious sentiments of Muslims. He says that when Government has promised to respect the sanctity of the sacred places of Islam and when that promise remains in force, it is not understood why those who do not even know what a Muslim is, should express their opinions on the religious problems of Muhammadans. ^ 15. In the Sahija (Bijnor) of the 12th July, 1916, the editor expresses The Arab revolt. regret at the Sheriff of Mecca’s declaration of in dependence, and says that it is highly improbable that the Sheriff, who is a descendent of the Prophet, would do anything in contra- yention of the teaching of Islam and jeopardise the sanctity of Mecca and Medina. He remarks that in view of the fact that the Sheriff was drawing a good pay from the Ottoman Government and had a good income from other sources it does not stand to reason that the Sheriff would have revolted unless some external influence was brought to bear upon him. He goes on to say that the result will not be favourable to the party which has exerted the pressure, because it will cause a conflagration throughout the Muslim world. He asserts that the Arab revolt has created unrest among Indian Muslims and he asks Government not to listen to the false expression of views of the sycophants like the editor of the Paisa Akhbar. title-holders or Government officials. He refers to the Cawnpore Machhli Bazaar Mosque affair and remarks that when Muhammadans sacrificed their lives for the preservation of a mosque, they will not tolerate this great catastrophe in Mecca and Medina. He asserts that the Muslim public denounce the Sheriff of Mecca and regard him with contempt for his disaffection to his Sovereign. (b) — Home. 16.

The Indian soldiers are no doubt able to bear comparison with the European soldiers, but if the whole Indian army is sent to the front India will remain unprotected. Ho suggests that a special war tax be imposed and says that the Indian public would gladly undertake to pay it rather than give personal service. He also suggests that the Eund thus collected should be spent in raising a good army including Africans who, he remarks, are better built an4 make better soldiers than Indians.

Q ar } lwa }i Sj Lansdowne, in which he dlS- cusses the need for .military training and suggests that Government should ’ introduce military training in schools and colleges. He says that the Kshattriyas and other people who practically do nothing could in this way make themselves fit for military service and remarks that a good regiment could be formed out of them without much training. He says that thus Indians would acquire military training and be helpful to Government in the time of need in future. He invites the attention of Government to the matter. 18. The Pratap (Cawnpore) of the 10th July, 1916, supports the proposal . of the Times (London) that second line territorial troops for the war, should be raised from among Indians and that they should be officered by Indians themselves. The editor says that it remains to be seen whether Government will accept the proposal and abandon its present policy in respect of recruitment in India. 19. The Pratap (Cawnpore) of the 10th July, 1916, refers to Lord Tie war and controversial Willingdon’s advice to the Deccan Sirdars not to raise ttlatter8 - contentious political matters till the conclusion of the war and enquires whether the helpless people alone are to follow this advice or whether Government also will act upon it. The editor says that hardly a week had passed when the Bombay Government itself raised some controversial matters in the Local Legislative Council. He remarks that if the India Office can in the name of the good of Indians and without consulting them raise controversies among them by trampling upon their aspirations, there is no reason why Indians should not protest. 20 . The war and controversial matters. Beferring to Lord Willingdon’s exhortation to the Deccan Sirdars to abandon political agitation during the progress of the war the Avadhbasi (Lucknow) of the 11th July, 1916, says that Government itself is responsible for all agitation in the country, for if it did not to take up contentious measures affecting the interests of the people they would never have recourse to agitation. 21. T\iq Pratap (Cawnpore) of the 10th July, 1916, expresses surprise Indian anarchists and Germany. ^ an experienced statesman and able adminis- trator like Lord Hardinge should have misgivings about the loyalty of Indians and should have declared to the representative of the jVew York Times (U. S.) that Indian seditionists and anarchists received help from Germany and that there had been a conspiracy to bring about a rebellion on the 25th December, 1915. The editor wonders that the people should have had no information about the alleged revolt, although it is alleged they were to participate in it. Bengalis never heard any report about the conspiracy before Lord Hardinge’s statement. He says that when the officials, including Lord Hardinge, declared before the outbreak of the war that India was wholly loyal and peaceful, it is surprising that the report about a proposed revolt should have been made now. The secret police reports appear to be responsible for Lord Hardinge’s opinion. He says that it is probably on such baseless police reports that hundreds of persons have been interned by the Bengal and other provincial Governments. He reminds Government of the maxim that trust begets trust and suspicion begets distrust. 22. Beferring to the recent murder of a Deputy Superintendent of Police The anarchical outrage at Cai- by anarchists at Calcutta the Saddharm Pracharak ^ tta ‘. (Kangri, Bijnor) of the 8th July, 1916, says that the incident proves the need for the spread of moral and religious education in the country. If proper arrangements were made for the imparting of such education, educated young Indians would never thus abuse their patriotism. The editor expresses agreement with the Mahratta (Poona) that conspiracy has its origin in aspiration and growth in despair and says that Government should pay due attention to, this aspect of the evil of anarchism. He enquires whetherThe war. I.—Politics. (a) Foreign, 1. (a) The Vesh (Lahore), of the 7th July 1916, affirms that the British and the French armies, which have attacked and are fighting with the Germans, are distinguished by two characteristics. In the first place, it has been proved that the artillery of the Allies is superior to that of the Germans. In the second place, Great Britain and France have now aeroplanes which are also superior to those of the bermans. This superiority in artillery and aircraft will prove a decisive factor in the war. Since the French and the British armies have taken the offensive they have continually advanced, gaining considerable success in capturing country which is at present in German possession. It can be safely inferred that ultimate victory will assuredly rest with the British and the French armies. Their present offensive is the precursor of victory, (b) The Kshatari (Gujranwala), of the 7th July 1916, remarks that a European astrologer predicts that in the spring of 1917 the Allies and Boumania will make a joint movement and will win back Servia and Montenegro. They will also invade Vienna and push back the Germans on all the fronts. During the hot weather Turkey will make separate peace, and Austria will be at her last gasp In November the German fleet will come out and there will be war, the like of which is not known in history. In the end, Germany will receive a crushing defeat. Peace conditions will be drawn up in 1918. (c) Writing under the heading The Offensive Movement of the Allied Army, the Kuan (Lahore), of the 10th July 1916, remarks that although the Fioneer refers to the places captured by the Allies in very ordinary language still it must be remembered that these places are not unimportant ones. A careful consideration of Reuter’s news will shew that during the last three or four days the Allies have captured very important places. The time has now come for the Germans to try to reduce their boasts to practice. But the victorious British army has been stirred to its depths. It has already started on a victorious career. Its assaults do not constitute mere show and they are not periodic outbursts of rough and boisterous activity as were those by which Germany has hitherto tried to draw the attention of the world to herself. The action which the British army is now taking is a measured and carefully calc ulated action. Its movement is undoubtedly slow, but it is none the less sure. We are anxiously awaiting the time when the Union Jack will victoriously flutter on the palace at Potsdam. 2. (a) The Paisa Akhbar (Lahore), of the 6th July 1916, publishes the second instalment of its article headed : What Tur ey and Ara Turks did in Arabia and What they Failed ie Do. The Turks, it says, ruled the Hedjaz for centuries, but they never looked upon it as conquered country. There is no city in the world which is not called upon to pay some sort of taxation to its ruler or muni cipality; but the Turks never realised a single farthing by way of tax from Mecca and Medina. On the other hand, they spent millions of rupees from their treasury in the service of the peopte of ^ Medina. The Turks always left the control of the roads in the Hedjaz in the hands of the Sheriff of Mecca and are not at all to blame if the Bedouins plunder or kill pilgrims. Their sole fault for which they have been so severely punished is that they invariably treated the Arabs with kindness and indulgence and disregarded the exigencies of administration. Even if the Arabs succeed in establishing permanent rule, the Islamic world will still doubt their ability to do half as much as the Turks have been doing in looking after the comfort of the pilgrims. After all, there are some men of ability and statesmen among the Turks ; but the Arabs do not possess such men at all. It is to be feared that they will not bo able to carry on the administration of the Hedjaz with success. (b) The Paisa Akhbar (Lahore), of the 8th July 1916, publishes a letter from a correspondent who notes that now that ^ the Sheriff of Mecca has re volted and demanded independence, a hope is being felt not only in India butalso in the British Parliament that the Sheriff will look after the convenience and safety of Muhammadan pilgrims; and it is also expected that in acquiring independence he will remove all hardships and defects m the system of pil- | orimage. It may be so. But those who have ever been on the pilgrimage know full well that it is the Arabs themselves who are really the cause of the pilgrims’troubles and that the Sheriff has been a party to these proceedings. I The pilgrims have no complaint against the Turks, and Arab independence j will only make the situation worse and result in the creation of so many new difficulties for pilgrims that Muhammadans will gradually give up going on pilgrimage at all. We are sincerely grateful to the British Government for its anxiety on behalf of the pilgrims. But we cannot help remarking that the pilgrims should not be left to the mercy of the Sheriff of Mecca. Govern ment should itself make some arrangements or let the Arabs and the Turks decide the matter between them. Those Muhammadans who are rejoicing over the revolt of the Sheriff of Mecca, in the belief that they will in future enjoy facilities in the performance of the pilgrimage—-the number of such Muham madans, however, is very limited—are mistaken. How can the Khan Baha durs who do not go even up to the threshold of a mosque^ ever proceed on a pilgrimage ? The writer has thrice performed the pilgrimage and claims to speak from personal experience. (c) The Paisa Akhhar (Lahore), of the 8th July 1916, quotes a passage from the Bengalee (Calcutta), which published a rejoinder to the Englishman's comments on the resolution of tho All-India Muslim League. The Bengalee ad vises non-Muhammadans to refrain altogether from criticizing the conduct of the Muhammadans, and the Paisa Alchbar fully supports the view as men of other communities are not and cannot be acquainted with, and indeed have no con nection with, these great revolutions to the same extent as the Muhammadans. (d) Al Asar (Lahore), of the 8th July 1916, remarks that the conduct of the Sheriff of Mecca in taking possession of Mecca and Tayf and in besieging Medina has exasperated all Muhammadans in India. Muhammadans hold their religion very dear to them and it is owing to their love for their religion that they have been forced to express their abhorrence of the Sheriff’s conduct. If Indian Muhammadans are displeased with the Sheriff’s conduct, they are moved not by political but by religious considerations. They have no concern if the Sheriff has or has not political relations with the authorities at Constanti nople. But it cannot be denied that the Sheriff’s proclamation has placed the sanctity and protection of the Sacred Places in danger; and it is this knowledge which is disquieting the Muhammadans in India. (e) Al Asar (Lahore), of the 8th July 1916, publishes the following notice :— “ A public meeting of the Muhammadans of Delhi will be held in the Fatehpuri Mosque to express abhorrence at the conduct of those ignorant Arabs who by their deplorable conduct against the Caliph of the Muhammadans have placed the Sacred Places of Islam in danger. “ A great shock has been caused to the Islamic world by the conduct of these ignorant persons in Arabia and the event has filled the minds of the Muhammadans with great grief and sorrow. Mecca aod Medina are linked with the hearts of all Muhammadans and the latter can in no circumstances tolerate that the sanctity of the Sacred Places should be assailed in the least by unpleasant effect. Love for the Sacred Places constitutes the blood which hows in the veins o£^ every Muhammadan. True Muhammadans, therefore, cannot but be affected by the insult and disrespect which these ignorant persons oi Arabia have shown towards Mecca and Medina. It is the duty of all Muhammadans to express abhorrence at the deplorable conduct of these ignorant persons, so that the true and right feelings of Muhammadans in relation to the Sacred Places of Mecca and Medina may find expression. With th*s end in view the Muhammadans of Delhi will hold at 5 a.m., after the evening prayer, a public meeting in the Fatehpuri Mosque on the 6 th July 1916.® It is to be hoped that all Muhammadans will take part in the meeting.” ♦ The notice is signed by a iarga number of Delhi Muhammadans, divided into two beads, tamelv. ulema and raises 3(/) Al Muntr (Jiang), of the 8th July 1916, remarks that while the Muhammadans of some places have deplored the revolt in Arabia, , others have rejoiced over the event and expressed the hope that pilgrims wouldjn future enpy peace. But the number of the former is very lar^e and tHey nave expressed their views not to support the cause of the Turks, but to voice the apprehension that if the trumpet of war is sounded in the Hediaz, rivers of blood would flow in the sacred land, and human blood run down in fa0S ?i^ aCe T W -^ ere, . a P ar ^ ^ r ? m ^ uniar,L beings, even animals and trees are not troubleo, It is owing to this fear that Muhammadans are condemning the conduct of the Sheriff. If they had any desire to support the cause of the lurks, the Muhammadans not only of India, but of Algeria and the Caucasus, would have never drawn their swords against those Muhammadan sepoys who na\e fought and are still fighting on. behalf of Germany and her allies. In the course of the present war, in spite of many misleading announcements and temptations, the Muhammadans of India have performed the proud part of not swerving as a nation from the path of their sacred religious duty of loyalty to their sovereign for the time being. And by the grace of God, they will maintain that loyalty. We sincerely pray that our Sacred Places may he fully protected from disrespect. The Turks are, however, fighting not for their religion, but for their country. They themselves, and not the Islamic world, are responsible for the good and bad consequences of the war. (g) The Ids an (Lahore), of the 8 th July 1916, criticizes the strange atti tude which the Statesman (Calcutta!, of the 4th July 1916, has adopted to discredit the meeting of the All-India Muslim League, in which a resolution express ing abhorrence at the revolt of the Sheriff of Mecca, was passed. The Statesman says that this was an unconstitutional meeting; but the voice of our contemporary is perhaps the first voice of its kind raised in the history of constitutional adminis tration. We do not know what will happen to the innumerable societies of India and England if the same question is raised regarding their meetings. The Coun cil of the All-India Muslim League is representative of Indian Muhammadans and the presence of a quorum of the Council makes if a regular representative meeting, A resolution adopted by the Council, when the meeting has a full quorum, will be naturally considered as having been passed by Indian Muslims as a whole. Moreover. Indian Muhammadans have had ample time to have protested against the resolution of the Council of the League if they had dis approved of it. Anyhow, if the means which the All-India Muslim League has adopted in passing the resolution be unconstitutional, we fail to understand what other means the public should adopt to give expression to its opinion. (h) The Kisan (Lahore), of the 10th July 1916, remarks that owing to the late receipt of the notice announcing that the Muhammadans of .Delhi in tended to hold a public meeting on the 6th July to express abhorrence at the conduct of the Sheriff of Mecca in organising the rebellion, it was obliged to withhold the publication of the notice. If may, however, be explained here that the notice in question publishes at its end a few sentences which should serve as an object lesson particularly to the Statesman and the Englishman. There is nothing to be surprised at if these sentences serve to remove the misunderstanding from the mind of our local contemporary of the Bulletin also. The sentences run as follows “ If is the duty of Muhammadans to express abhorrence at the de plorable conduct of the ignorant persons in order that expression may be given to the Islamic faith relating to the Sacred Places of Mecca and Madina, as also the true views and the real sentiments of the Muhammadan community. , The paper also says that the Calcutta meeting which was held to protest against the conduct of the Sheriff of Mecca was not an ordinary one, as has been alleged by same papers. If the latter had acted justly and honestly they would have considered that it was not an ordinary thing for the small Muslim population of Calcutta to have been represented by from sixty to eighty peI^sons, ,, (i) The Bajput Hiilmri (Lahore), of the 1st July 1916, remarks that the Arabs had been for a long time complaining against the Turkish GovernmentI 682 and looldne forward to an opportunity to throw off, the Ottoman yoke. They hare now declared their independence. The independence of Arabia is another serious injury which the Turks hare suffered in this war. r (j) The Ehaha AkUar (Lahore', of the 7th July 1916, finds it difficult to understand why Indian Muhammadans are unnecessarily expressing indignation at the proclamation of Arabian independence by the Sheriff of Mecca. The Muhammadans of Lucknow held a ^meeting;- but can their reso, lution of indignation, have any affect on the Sheriff of Mecca and the Arabs ? (k) The Publ c (Lahore), of the 8th July 1916, says that the declar ation of the independence of Arabia has undoubtedly created an unprecedented sensation in the Islamic world. , If the Sheriff has forcibly taken possession of the sacred places in Arabia, the question is who the Caliph is going to be. In other words, will the Sultan of Turkey or the Sheriff of Mecca be the Caliph ? This and several other imilar questions are exercising the minds of Muhammadans. / /m I (l) The Sanatan Dharm Parcharak (Amritsar), of the 8th July 1916, has heard with surprise that the Muhammadans of India have opposed the lawful conduct of the Arabs in breaking away from Turkey. This is apparent from the fact that the All-India Muslim League recently expressed abhorrence at the Arabian revolt and declared that those who support the Arabs are the enemies of Islam. The Muslim League of Lahore also held a similar meeting. The Muhammadans of Calcutta also characterized the conduct of Arabs as rebellious and detestable. (m) The Parkash (Lahore), of the 9th July 1916, observes that the rebellion of the Arabs has not made a good impression on Indian Muham madans. In the beginning one or two messages announced that the Muham madans of certain places had heard the news of Arabian independence with pleasure. But different views are being now expressed. The All-India Muslim League expressed indignation. Its views were courageously supported by the Muhammadans of Lucknow and the Punjab Muslim League. News^ has also been received that a public meeting was held in Calcutta in which disapproval was expressed at the Sheriff’s proclamation. Muhammadan newspapers too have not viewed the Sheriff’s action with approval, and this feeling has gone to the length of making the Vakil (Amritsar) urge that if the Turks send an expedi tion against the Arabs, the British Government should not interfere. In our opinion, no true Muhammadan can feel pleasure at the proclamation, which is likely to deal a death blow to the Turkish Empire. No one will suppose that Arabia can remain independent. If it does not remain under the control of Turkey, it will be subjected to some other power, as it is not strong enough to stand on its own legs. Anglo-Indian newspapers are trying to make Muhammadans believe that the independence of Arabia will do good to Islam. Their wishes would have been better fulfilled if they had kept quiet, for their writings are strengthening the suspicion latent among the Muham madans that the present disturbance in Arabia does not augur well for the future of Islam. (n) The Urdu Bulletin (Lahore), of the 8th July 1916, refers to the meeting of the Muhammadans of Calcutta held to deplore the independence of the Arabs, and remarks that it had characterized those who contended that the Muhammadans of Calcutta were glad at the proclamation of the independ ence of Arabia as speaking a falsehood. The Statesman has published a strong note, saying that the meeting was not a public one, that it was held in a private house, and that the number of persons who attended it did not exceed fifty or sixty. If this statement is correct, the Bulletin cannot help remarking that the meeting, regarding which lengthy telegrams have been received, was an ordi nary one to which no importance should be attached. (o) The Urdu Bulletin (Lahore), of the 12th July 1916, remarks that the Sheriff’s proclamation is causing excitement among Indian Muhammadans. The Statesman has suggested that the Government should prohibit the telegraphic despatch of the proceedings of all meetings at which Muham madans express resentment at the Sheriff’s conduct. The Bengalee (Calcutta)Vigorously protests against the suggestion. We too doubt whether such an arrangement can prove effectual in allaying excitement. r&gt; • -n j (Miore), of the 9th July 1916, publishes a letter from Kai Bahadur Kunj Behari Thapar, who, writing on behalf of the War News Association, remarks that the proclamation of the Sheriff of Mecca is a famous historical event. It will affect not only Muslim countries but all other parts of tlm world as well. Those who know history are aware that the Arabs have in their own time contributed largely to the development of knowledge and arts. The Arab conquerors over-ran distant countries and spread their civilisation at a time when Europe was still enveloped in the darkest ignorance. This progressive ancient nation has now again stirred after centuries of sleep. Impressed by the progress of other nations and roused to the disadvantages of its position under Turkish rule, it is resolved to make up for lost time and opportunities. Those who are anxious to see liberty, politics, knowledge and arts spreading all over the world and democracy gaining full advantage from the new light will be undoubtedly highly pleased at the news that the Arabs have declared independence. Arabia again appears to be anxious to march on the high road to liberty and progress, and Muham madans especially and lovers of liberty and politics generally should re joice over the proclamation of the Sheriff of Mecca. As a matter of fact, many Muhammadans have already expressed their pleasure at the revolt in Arabia. There are, however, some narrow-minded and short-sighted Mu hammadans who have denounced this blessed proclamation. But when they will consider the matter from all sides they will surely approve of the Sheriff’s proclamation. And it should be remembered that Indian pilgrims to the Hedjaz will now no longer suffer the hardships which they experienced before, (q) The Desk (Lahore), of the 12th July 1916, publishes another letter from Bai Bahadur Kunj Behari Thapar extolling the bravery of the Arabs, the descent of the Sheriff and the future prospects of peaceful rule in the Hedjaz. ^ (r) The Desk (Lahore), of the 12th July 1916, publishes a communicat ed article from an “ Independent-minded Muhammadan,” who discusses the whole question of the Caliphate and the attitude of Indian Muslims towards the Turks and the Arabs. The proclamation of the Sheriff of Mecca, be says, will have a far-reaching effect on the question of the Caliphate, and it has, therefore, excited keen interest in the Islamic world. It appears that Muham madans outside India approve of the independence of Arabia. But their co religionists in India are not agreed on the point. At some places the proclam ation has been welcomed by them with pleasure, and at other places they have expressed resentment at the Sheriff’s action. It is, however, borne out by history that the Arabs have always tried to throw off the Turkish yoke. Indeed, the natural position and condition of their country forbid their living in subjection to others. In face of such a systematic longing on the part of the Arabs, it is not posible to look upon the recent proclamation as anything novel or strange. Moreover, the Turks had usurped the Caliphate which formerly belonged to the Arabs, which assumed a political aspect only in passing into the hands of the Turks. The writer then proceeds to give a his torical view of the institution of the Caliphate in Muslim countries, and how the title was claimed and held by four dynasties of Muhammadan rulers with Damascus, Baghdad, Cordona and Cairo as their capitals. This historic analysis of the subject proves that it is the Arabs, and not the Turks, who are in reality entitled to the Caliphate. The Caliphate is now the right either of the Abbassid family of Egypt, which is still reigning in that country, or of the Arabs, the claim of the latter being the superior. The Muhammadans of India or of other countries who do not approve of the con duct of the Arabs are in the wrong. The Arabs were never pleased with the Turkish rule and were ever on the watch for an opportunity to gain freedom. The present war has afforded that opportunity. If Indian Muham madans condemn the Arabs, they openly support the Turks, who are fighting for Germany in opposition to Great Britian. The Muslim League, a representa tive association of Indian Muhammadans, has declared Indian autonomy to bem its ideal. The Arabs have also forcibly obtained liberty from a Government with which they were never pleased. ^ Can Indian Muhammadans consistently condemn the Arabs ? The position is a delicate one and ,it behoves Indian Muslims to be patient and cautious in the expression of their views. W The Jiwan Tat (Lahore), of the 10th July 1916, remarks that a wave of displeasure is passing over Muslim India against the Sheriff of Mecca for his proclamation of the independence of Arabia. The paper refers to the meetings of the AlMndia Muslim League, the new Punjab Muslim League and the Musalmans of Lucknow and Calcutta and ascribes Muhammadan feeling to the fear of bloodshed at the Sacred Places. They also apprehend that the fate of the Caliphate is at stake. (t) The Hindustan (Lahore), of the 12th July 1916, affirms that, seen in the light of history, this is not the first occasion when the Arabs have revolted against the Turks. They have ever been a {freedom-loving nation and even in recent'times Ottoman rule in Arabia has been only nominal. The paper goes on to recapitulate the various attempts which the Arabs made to obtain liberty and to observe that on finding a favourable opportunity they have again raised the standard of liberty. There is no reason why this freedom-loving nation should remain subject to Turkey. Al Asar (Lahore), of the 9th July 1916, states that it appears Famine in Germany. from letters found^ in the possession of German prisoners that famine prevails in Germany. It is mentioned m the letter that there was a serious riot in the course of which people broke the glass windows of shops and carried away what- eyer they could lay their hands on. The letters in question also dwell on the Cerman^ ^ ° Dtammg food * Tllis WGuW indicate the present state of affairs in 4. The Kisan (Lahore), of the 11th July 1916, suggests that The treatment of prisoners. though the condition of prisoners of war in . , , Turkey may not be enviable, still the Turks are, according to their understanding and means, treating their prisoners well. fw Zl T , r 3 r^ 0 fo '? ht with the Turks bear witaass to the fact that the Turks fight lika gentlemen. This is a remark which has never regarding the German soldiers. If on the strength of any agree ment Turkey were to take over from Germany the charge of British prisoners of war. we are sure she would not let them die of starvation. P 6.

In a brilliant retrospect of Lord Kitchener’s career, the Nation makes a forcible comment which should give democrats to think. What is the moral of Kitchener’s career? The IVhfo'ow says : ‘An Indian and Eastern Empire takes much from the Mother Country. , . . spends her boldest and ablest children ageing em beneath its blazing suns, and giving their minds the impress of its older civilisations, with their autocratic traditions and deliberate Orientalism.’ Ihe remark is just, but it is as truly applicable to the boldest and ablest children which the Mother Country spends on her Indian and Eastern Empire, as to the institutions which their genius help to stereotype. The older civilizations seem to be growing older, the autocratic traditions more autocratic, and the deliberate Orientalism more deliberate. Orientals are not nt for self-government; ergo, make them more unfit than ever and for ever. That is deliberate Orientalism, Autocracy is the traditional note of Orientalism : let it be the second postulate. The third is, let the boldest and ablest of the pro-Consuls, ageing under blazing Oriental suns, get absorbed by the spirit of absolutism and autocracy. What is the result when a great crisis occurs at home and your boldest and ablest are called to service (as Lord Kitchener was), you find a would-be dictator of democracy—something unsuitable, difficult to get on with positively intolerable. Wh emphatically agree with the Nation when it says: ‘Too long have we allowed that tradition to linger. The time is ripe and over-ripe for change in India.’ It is.” 12.

Japan has, morever, secured supremacy in the East which is not likely to be challenged by any one. [Here the paper takes a review of the general political situation of the European states and winds up with :—] If in the final settlement Germany has to exchange her colonies for the territories she has now gained she will in no way be benefited. England has secured German colonies and Egypt and Mesopotamia from Turkey. She has proved her naval supremacy over Germany and might succeed in starving her to death. Comments on the revolt of the Sherif of Mecca. *Mufid-e-Bozgdr % (117), 16th July; Praja Mitra and Par si (22), 13th July. 13. The Mufid-e -Bozgdr considers the attempted revolt of the Sherif of Mecca as contemptible, and states that his act has naturally engendered consternation among the Muhammadans of India. It thinks that the Turks will not be able to suppress the rising because they are occupied in waging war elsewhere, and it holds that if they are not powerful enough to retain posses sion of their dominions then none can help them to preserve their empire intact. It is of opinion that the Arabs are incapable of maintaining even that semblance of order and security which prevails in Arabia under the Turkish rule and it blames the Arabs for the evils from which their country is suffering in these days. It exhorts all thinking Muhammadans to devise measures for the purpose of defeating the Sherif’s aims. [The Proja Mitra and Pdrsi is of opinion that non-Moslems should carefully weigh the grounds on which the Moslem League and other public bodies in India have pro tested against the revolt of the Sherif of Mecca against the authority of the Sultan of Turkey and that they should not be hasty in deriding the Moslem attitude towards the question. It admits that there is some justifica-19 Appreciation of the assent given by His Excellency the Viceroy to the United Provinces Municipalities Bill.

But Indians are so unfortunate that evenTthey go to civilised western countries they are not free from po ca surveillance. [The paper then describes the house search.] If it had taken place in India it would have excited no comments, but as such a thing is uncommon in western countries a question was asked m Parliament and Mr Asquith has promised an inquiry. We know what such assurances mean in India • we have to see whether they will lead to diflereut results m Bnglan . A meeting was held at Salem (Madras) to express indignation and it is doubtful whether the citizens of Salem would have been courageous enough to protest if a similar thing had occurred in their own city And until such courage is exhibited whether Mr. Chetty is in India or England the police will not feel any hesitation in dishonouring him. 9 “ His Excellency Lord Chelmsford has earned the ever-lasting gratitude of Muslim India by giving his assent to the United Provinces Municipalities Bill. His assent to the Bill removes, once for all, a long standing grievance of the Muslim Community in the United Provinces of Agra and Ondh. The Bill by ensuring to the Musalmans an adequate share of representation on the United Provinces Munici palities is bound to improve the existing Hindu- Muhammadan relations in that Province. Will the ?. 0ve o r ?“ e “‘ still persist in its refusal of granting separate electorates to the Mussalmans even after the example set before it by His Excellency the Viceroy ? 10. The Islamic Mail considers it almost futile to protest against the appointment of a nou-Muhammadan to be a Judge of the Bombay High Court, since the appointment was merely a temporary one. It is convinced that the claims of the Musalmans will be duly considered when a permanent vacancy occurs. It then goes on to refer- to the feeling of dissatisfaction which, says the paper, undoubtedly permeates the Moslem world, and ascribes it to the Cawnpore Mosque affair and the Balkan problem. It maintains that the recent announcement of the Government of Bombay saying that they are not prepared to grant the right to the Muhammadans of separate representation on the newly constituted District Local Boards has, if anything, intensified the existing dissatisfaction, while every Moslem is now apt to fall into line with Mr. Mazherul-Haque who is doubtful if his co-religionists have reaped any advantage by refraining from partaking in political agitation. The paper is of opinion that the politicians of the Congress School always get what they want, and it counsels Government to grant to the Muhammadans those privileges which were promised them so that they may realise the advantages of being on the side of the Government, and also with a view to prevent them from ■joining hands with the agitators and political propagandists. [In its English edition the paper ascribes the feeling of dissatisfaction^ among the Muhammadans to the ‘ pro-Hindu character’ of the administration of Lord Hardinge, who ‘ in his enthusiasm for pacification advanced the interests of the agitators’beyond legitmate limits, and the minority was left helpless.’ It concludes the article thus :— u Anyhow it is useless at this juncture to count past failures, and shed tears over them. The future ought to be, and is, our concern. The uneasiness of the Muhammadans is increased by the considera tion that in the coming readjustment they might fare worst, and the Hindus win the game. It is for Government to set their minds at rest by showing them that their interests are not neglected. They are holding a united session of the League and the Congress at Lucknow a thing in which they failed last year in Bombay. The object is to put the Congress halter round the neck of the Muhammadans. If they succeed it will be disastrous both to the interests of the Muhammadans and to the policy of Governmenti Govern ment should, therefore, catch the bull by the horn and show themselves true leaders and friends of the Musalmans, which they are. It will have a magi cal effect, and change the current of Moslem feeling from the objectionable What should Govern- ment do to allay the dis satisfaction existing among Muhammadans.

In its issue of the 27 th June 1916 the paper says that if the Sheriff succeeds m establishing his independence the Sultan of Turkey will assuredly lose his claim to the Caliphate of Islam. I he position of the Sheriff appears to be a strong one, and this is the third loss which Turkey has suffer ed since her alliance with Germany. She has already lost Cyprus and ,^ e °f the 28th June 1916, refers to the news from Calcutta that there is general rejoicing in Muslim circles over Arabian independence Indeed, Muhammadans should realise that since the Young Turks have assumed the administration of Turkey, pilgrimage to the Hedjaz has become a dangerous enterprise and pilgrims have been plundered at the instance of the Turkish a ^n 0 ?^ e i 8 i a ^'^' eCca an( ^ ^ ma y ^0 now expected that the Arabs Trill be able to protect the pilgrims properly with the help of the British Many Muhammadans in India are rejoicing oyer the attempt of the Arabs to throw off the Turkish yoke. (o) The Desk, of the 30th June 1916, states that some Muhammadans de plore the Sheriff’s proclamation and characterize his action as rebellions. The Muhammadans of Lucknow held a meeting on the 27th June to consider how far the protection of the Sacred Places of Islam will be endangered by the Sheriff’s rebellion. It remains to be seen what view of the situation is taken at the meeting. The Muhammadans of Calcutta, however, are rejoicing over the Sheriff’s proclamation, and are saying that the Arabs have a natural right to independence. In its issue of the 1st July 1916 the paper says that the Muhammadans not only in Arabia but in several Indian provinces are glad that the Sheriff has deolared Arabian independence. K. B. Walji Lalji, a prominent Mnsalman of Madras, declares that the news has been received with satisfaction by the Muhammadans of Madras. Indeed, many Indian Muhammadans, who formerly used to sympathize with the Turks, are now regarding them with abhorrence. 0) The Paisa Akhbar (Lahore), of the 30th June 1916, tries to show that the revolt in Arabia will succeed if it has been decreed by God. The establishment of a powerful Ottoman empire and the continu ance of Turkish rule in Europe for hundreds of years, as well as the Ottoman custody of the sacred places of Islam and Christianity, can be ascribed to^ two causes—partly to the Turks* own strength of arms and partly to Divine dispensation. But if the Turks cease to be sufficiently strong to safeguard their property from their enemies and if God does not will that they should remain the masters and custodians of the Sacred Places, no power can help them in maintaining their position. Those who believe in the Koranic tenet that not an atom can move without God’s command will not credit the possibility of the Turks ceasing to rule the Hedjaz or any other land contrary to the will of God. Indeed, if the Turks lose their hold over the Hedjaz, people will believe that this is the result of the will and dis pensation of God, If, on the other hand, the Arabs do not succeed in their independence, this too will be ascribed to the will of God. “ Arabia for the Arabs *’ is not a new idea, whether the Arabs desire it themselves or other people help them to gain their own ends. However, these are points which the Turks should have fully considered before embarking upon the war. It is possible that they may have considered the matter and Enver Pasha’s last tour in the Hedjaz may have been in pursuance of this very object. If then the Turks were not prepared for all eventualities, it is difficult to see why they came into the war. But now that they have entered the lists, they and the Islamic world should be prepared to face the consequences of&gt;‘»V 658 their action. No doubt, many Muhammadans will sympathize with the Turks in their present misfortune, but they should bear in mind that when before the outbreak of the war Indian Muhammadans urged the Turks not to place them in difficulties by participating in the war the latter heeded only their own interests and paid no attention to the telegrams sent from India to the Turkish Premier in Constantinople, nor to the articles which appeared in the Indian newspapers, including the Pciisct -A JchbaY , which printed a series of four or five articles to show that it would be detrimental to Turkish interests to join the war. Now if Arabia passes away from their hands, Indian Mu hammadans should consider the situation with patience and equanimity, and should believe that countries belong to God and that He makes them over to whomsoever He wills. Having quoted some verses from the Koran, the paper concludes by remarking that verily God is the master of a country, and that whenever that country passes away from the possession of a person it must be held that God so willed it. In such cases, it is incumbent on Mu hammadans to resign themselves to God’s will. Many Indian Muhammadans will disapprove of the Arabs’ bad treatment of the Turks and of their rebellious ness ; because they know that the Arabs are wholly unworthy to rule the Hedjaz. If Turkish rule was characterized by defects, Arab rule will be worse. Even now the Arabs are responsible for the existing mismanagement in the Hedjaz to a greater extent than the Turks. d) The Paim Akhbar (Lahore), of the 5th July 1916, in a leader on the/revolt in Arabia, says that the present is the best opportunity for the Arabs to establish a permanent national government in their country. Turkey is engaged in a life and death struggle in Mesopotamia and A sia Minor, and the Arabs know full well that she can send no reinforcements to the Hedjaz just now. She could do so only by the Hedjaz railway, but the stations on that line to a distance of one hundred miles from Medina are reported to have been destroyed by the Sheriff. And even if the Turks manage to collect troops, they will find it difficult to bring them to Medina. Again, although Medina is a fortified city there is no hope of reinforcements to the Turkish army besieged there reaching the place soon, or indeed at all, even if it is supposed that the besieged are sufficiently numerous and have sufficient provisions with them. The paper then goes on to say that the Turks are both to blame and blameless in the revolt. Durmg the four hundred years of their rule in Arabia they have never been able completely to subjugate the Arabs, while it has become the second nature of the latter to obey no one but the chiefs of their tribes. As to these chiefs, they obey the Sheriff of Mecca for two reasons—firstly, owing to his being a direct descendant of the Prophet, and secondly because the Arab clans have always recognised the chief of his family as their head. Nor is this all. The Sheriff already occupies in Arabia a position in no way inferior to that of a king, and was under the Sultan of Turkey only in name.— (To be continued.) vf) The Vakil (Amritsar), of the 1st July 1916, having printed a short Ipstoric retrospect of Arabia in the XVIIth, XVIIIth and the earlier part of the XIXth centuries, adds that after many vicissitudes Turkey at last gain ed a footing in Arabia and the custody of the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. There was, however, no love lost between the Turks and the Arabs nevertheless, the power of the Turks and the Sultan’s position as Caliph secured for them the greatest respect all over the world. The Sheriff of Mecca, hitherto a servant of the Sultan, could not muster courage to rise against his master. But it is undeniable that adverse forces, though quiescent^ were always in existence. It- will not strange if the Turkish Government loses its spiritual prestige after these events. Nor will it be surprising if the crown of the Caliphate is seized from the Ottoman dynasty and placed on the head of the Sheriff of Mecca. This will, in other words, mean that the succession to the Caliphate, before whose greatness the powers of the east and the west trembled like the willow, will be now conferred on the unworthy shoulders of one who will be a mere puppet in the hands of others. In these circumstances, we consider the resolution* of the All-India Muslim 'League, and the decision of the public meeting of Lucknow, as also the telegram sent by Maulana Abdul Bari to the Viceroy, to be a correct expres sion of the views of the Muhammadan world. We also fully understand the significance of the adverse opinion expressed by a few Muhammadans of Calcutta, Khan Bahadur Walji Lalji of Madras, the ulema of Egypt and the students of the Jama-i-Azhar. We are also not ignorant of the true significance of the hope expressed by Muhammad Quddus Badshah of Madras that with the guidance of the British the Sheriff of Mecca will render magnificent services to Islam. We also realise the importance of the views expressed by an Anglq-Indian newspaper, which says that so far as the Sacred Places are concerned, the British Government has already announced that it will protect them from external aggression. There can be. no doubt that the Sheriff of Mecca is destroying the railway stations of the Hedjaz railway and is cutting the wires, and has also organised, with surprising rapidity, three armies and has stationed them at different places. But we hope that if the Turks make an attempt to suppress the Arab rebellion, the British Government will not interfere, because the Turks will fight, not against the Sacred Places, but with the rebels. As it is the duty of every Government to punish rebels properly other Powers should not place obstacles in their way if the Turks perform their duty of suppressing rebellion. Be sides, this is not a matter wherein the Governor of a* province has rebelled against duly constituted authority. The subject is connected with im portant question of the Caliphate of Islam, in which no one except Muhammadans are interested. The British Government will act wisely on the present occasion and will not be misled by the misleading views of some persons in Calcutta, Madras and other places so as to misunderstand the situation or act in a mariner opposed to the views of the Muslim public. The JPanjabee (Lahore), of the 4th July 1916, reproduces the remarks of the Englishman regarding the resolution of the All-India Muslim League on the declaration of Arab independence and observes :— “ As this is a matter which concerns only the Muslim community, we entirely agree with a Calcutta contemporary that it is no part of our business either to applaud or to con demn expressions of Muhammadan opinion either in the press or at public meetings. An attitude of aloofness is what best befits other communities in a matter which clearly does not concern them/’ The Hindustan (Lahore), of the 5th July 19.16, publishes a note headed Independent Arabia, in which it says that the Sheriff’s army has ' demolished stations on the Hedjaz railway for a distance of a hundred miles, wrecking the line at the same time. To tell the truth it is this railway which has brought about the revolt of the Arabs ; seeing that it has thrown out of employment as many as 180,000 Bedouins, whose livelihood depends only on ceurying pilgrims from Jeddah to Mecca, from the latter place to Medina and thence to Damascus. This was why some years back they did not allow the Turks to proceed with the section of the Hedjaz railway ' proposed to be constructed between Mecca and Medina. In another place the paper quotes an extract from the Paisa AIMar disapproving of the conduct of the Arabs in rebelling against Turkey, and says that it is surprising that those who rejoice over the independence of every other nation should feel offended at the independence of the Arabs. The present war is being waged to restore their liberty to the weaker nations, and Russia and Great Britain joined in it only to preserve the independence of Servia and Belgium. Again, it has also been decided to confer Home Rule on Ireland, while Egypt has freed herself from the clutches of lurtrey. And if the Arabs have now secured their natural right, why-should any one feel offended at it ? Are the Arabs, who once ruled half the world, now unlit to administer their own country and throw off the Turkish yoke r Rlse- wRere the paper refers to the meeting of the Lucknow Muhammadans, a which abhorrence was expressed at the conduct of the Sheriff, and sayo ia in all probability this opinion is entertained by only a few particular Muslim residents of Lucknow, and that even these will have to change then views a- crpondering over the real facts. It is difficult to understand why the Muham madans in any other country should take umbrage at the independence of the Arabs. The Arabs can achieve greater progress if they are a free people than by continuing as the slaves of Turkey. (i) Writing about the Lucknow meeting, the Urdu Bulletin (Lahore), of the 5th July 1916, remarks that Indians should feel pleased at the Arab indepen dence, although it has been proclaimed at a distance of hundreds of miles from India. It is, however, surprising to see that Indian Muhammadans, so far from feeling glad at the event, are expressing sorrow and indignation at the conduct of the. Arabs. 2,—The T-ribtme (Lahore), of the 6th July 1916, quotes the following from a speech delivered by Mr. H. S. L. Polak at Effect Of the war on Ae.a. Johannesburg last month f ‘ One of the necessary consequences of the present terrible conflict in Europe would be the inevitable weakening of the organised forces of Europe, and ^ a natural sequence of this would be the relative strengthening of the organised forces of Asia. Much would depend upon the way in which the future contact of Europe and Asia took place. If they approached each other in the spirit of conflict that had existed in previous centuries, the only result would ^ be catastrophe j but if, as he believed was undoubtedly possible, they approached each other in a spirit of sympathy and mutual aid, each would then be able to contribute its special gift to wards the common fund of humanity ; and towards this desirable end both the Russian nation, European and Asiatic, and the Jewish people, who were Asiatic in origin but had acquired habits and customs of the thought familiar to the west, would largely contribute. ” 3. In a paragraph headed The First Bailway Train in Persia the . n . (Lahore), of the 4th July 1916, quotes an ex- Tbe first railway m ersm. | rom a wr iting by the United States Commercial Attache at Petrograd, who describes how thousands of Persians flocked to see the first railway train arrive at Tabriz from the Eussian frontier. But we cannot say, is the paper’s comment, whether the Persians would have welcomed this new Eussian railway with the same enthusiasm if they had known what important a part railways play in European politics. 4. The Ary a Gazette (Lahore), of the 29th June 1916, publishes a , „ , T note headed A Sveciden of American Civilisation. Amencans and Red Indians. . . ., - 1 . Americans, it says, boast of their civilisation but they hate Eed Indians, the original inhabitants of the country, who have played a prominent part in the making of modern America. Eecently a Eed Indian in Texas murdered an old white woman. This exasperated the whites, who caught hold of the culprit and brought him before the court. He was then burnt alive in the presence of a crowd numbering five thousand. It is true that murder is a grave crime punishable with death. But the punishment should be justifiable from the legal, moral and social points of view. It is cer tainly preposterous that a guilty person should be burnt alive. And this in America, the country which is called the land of freedom, civilisation and equality.

They say that India has not taken h&amp;r proper share in providing the sinews of war, but there is a world of difference between their and Indians’ points of view. These papers expect us to make all kinds of sacrifices, but they are not prepared to give us our rights. They wish us to provide the largest number of men to fight, but they will never recommend that we should be appointed to higher posts in the army. They certainly desire that millions of Indians should go to the front, but they can never wish that we should be permitted to get our selves enrolled as volunteers. It is their heartfelt desire that every Indian should fight the Government’s enemies in the hour of need, but they can never tojerate that the Arms Act should be repealed and we should be allowed toI.—Politics. . Cct) — Foreign. 1. The Indian Daily Telegraph (Lucknow) of the 29th June, 1916, ’WSfrrJeWiT. contains an account of the proceedings of a largely 0-7*1, V * A- *. atte “ (led Muhammadan meeting at Lucknow on the 27th June to discuss the Arab revolt. Mr. Saiyid Nabi-ullah, Barrister-at- law, who presided pointed out the deep anxiety and alarm which had been caused among Muhammadans by the reports of the Arab outbreak in the Kedjaz The first resolution was moved by Maulvi Nizam -ud-din Hasan seconded by Mr. Muhammad Nasim, Advocate, and supported by Hakim Abdul Qavi and Mr. Mumtaz Husain, Barrister-at-Law. The resolution recorded the deen abhorrence and indignation of the Muhammadans of Lucknow at the reported detestable conduct of the Arab rebels, endangering the safety and sanctity of the Holy places of the Hedjaz and Mesopotamia. The resolution condemned the Arab rebels and their sympathisers as enemies of Islam. The speakers dwelt on the unique sanctity of the Holy places of Mecca and Medina and laid emphasis on the sacred Islamic injunction which declared these places to be Dar-ul-Aman or the “ Abodes of peace. They condemned the action of the rebels wbo'diad let loose all the sanguinary horrors of war around their holiest shrines They said a true Musalman could only look with detestation on these happenino&gt; s as long as he remembered his supreme duty to preserve the House of God and the tomb of the holy Prophet from desecration and outrage. The second resolution was moved by Mr. Shahid Husain, seconded by the Hon’ble Mr. Saiyid Wazir Hasan and supported by Mr. Saiyid Zahur Ahmad and Hr. Nasir-ud-din Hasan. This resolution repudiated the suggestion contained in a Calcutta telegram that any class of Muhammadans can be delighted with the reported Arab rebellion or can view with any feeling other than alarm and disgust the consequences likely to ensue therefrom. Mr. Shahid Husain in the course of his speech referred to the loyalty of Indian Muhammadans to the British Government. He said that the Arab revolt in the Hedjaz was to Muhammadans a purely religious question as it involved the safety and sanctity of their holy places. This question and the equally important one of the Caliphate touched them most deeply and they could not tolerate any gratuitous suggestion or advice in regard to them. The other speakers denounced the* attempt recently made to show that the Muhammadans welcomed the news of the revolt and characterised it as mischievous and misleading. The Indian Daily Telegraph further says that information has been received from Maulvi Salamat Ullah Sahib, Secretary, Majlis Alia Anjuman-i- Khuddam-i-Kaaba that “ the Muhammadans repudiate in the most emphatic manner the suggestion that any guidance or assistance by the British Govern ment in the affairs of the Hedjaz will be welcome to them; and consider it imperative in the interests of the Government that it should be apprised of the fact that even the contemplation of a contingency of an un-Islamic protectorate would be repugnant and most painful to them, being wholly opposed to the principles of Islam/’ 2. The Leader (Allahabad) of the 29th June, 1916, comments on the The Arab n&gt;*6it meeting of the Council of the All-India Muslim ' League held recently at Lucknow at which a resolution was passed expressing abhorrence at the action of the Arab rebels and condemning them as enemies of Islam. The editor says that it is clear that the Grand Sheriff and the Arabs by whom he is supported are not hostile to the British and consequently “may rely upon British support for the maintenance of their independence.” He says that it is not clear how the sanctity of sacred places has been placed in jeopardy by the action of the Arabs and how these and their ‘ sympathisers ’ are the enemies of Islam. The Nizam-ul-MulIi (Moradabad) of the 30th June, 1916, refers to the reported Arab revolt and remarks that every Muham madan will be perturbed at hearing the news. 3. The Arab revolt.

The Anand (Lucknow) of the 1st July, 1916 (received on the 5th July), refers to the Arab revolt, and says that the ' inhabitants of Syria and Mesopotamia and the educated Egyptians are gratified at the news of the revolt. The editor observes 'that some of the Indian Muhammadans, the All-India Muslim League, and other (_ Muslim societies, have protested against the action of the Grand Sheriff on religious grounds. He remarks that the Egyptian Muhammadans do not see any°harm to Muhammdanism at the proclamation of independence by the Grand Sheriff while the Indian Muslims consider his action to be injurious to their religion. He wonders why the Indian Muhammadans make such undesirable protests aitd remarks that they regard even the sympathisers of the Grand Sheriff to be the enemies of Islam. He says that Indians should sympathise with the enemies of Turkey and that the more Turkey is harassed, the better it will be for the Allies. He remarks that the loyalty of the Indian Muhammadans is set aside | on the slightest pretext. 5. In the Leader (Allahabad) of the 1st July, 1916, the editor says that in connection with the Arab revolt there seems to be The Arab revolt. a difference of opinion between the Indian Muham-* madans and their co-religionists in Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia. He says that the latter are reported to be whoh-heartedly with the Grand Sheriff, where as the Lucknow Muslims strongly condemn the Arabs. He says that it may he that the Muslims in *yria, Mesopotamia and Egypt being more in touch with local conditions are better able to understand and appreciate the situation. In any case, says the editor, it seems unlikely that the attitude of Muhammadans outside Arabia will have any effect on the leaders of the revolt. 6. The Garhivali (Dehra Dun) of the 1st July, 1916, says that the Arab Tbe Arab revolt revolt against Turkey is advantageous to the Allies and remarks that if it assumes a serious aspect, as it is hoped it will, the Turks will fare very badly. 7. In Khalil (Bijnor) of the 1st July, 1916 (received on the 5th July), The Arab revolt the editor says that it is a matter of the greatest pride to Indian Muhammadans that they considered their loyalty to their king to be their paramount religious duty. They looked upon the outbreak of hostilities between Great Britain and Turkey as an act of purely political significance and from that point of view they expressed their regret at the action of the Ottoman Government. The only thing that did make them uneasy and anxious was the apprehension lest the war should lead to a violation, of the sanctity of the sacred places of Islam. This fear was however put at rest by the declaration of the British Government and her Allies to respect the sacredness of those places. The peace of mind of Indian Muhammadans has once again been seriously disturbed by the news of the Arab revolt which means that the Sheriff of Mecca turned traitor to the Sultan and broke the vow of fealty. The news of the Arab revolt should not have been allowed publication in India. Being at war with Turkey it will be only natural for the British Govern ment to receive the news with satisfaction. He affirms that the uneasiness at the news is due merely to religious sentiments because the act of the Sheriff will discredit Mam. The Muhammadan world wishes the sanctity of its sacred places to be respected. He roes on to say that the end of the revolt can be foreseen and it has no. greater significance than that of a local disturbance. The attention of the Turks may for a time be diverted but they will easily overcome the Sheriff. He observes that though all anti-German countries will welcome the news of the Arab revolt yet it should not be imagined that the British Government nas had any hand in the matter. The British Government has always shown great consideration for the feelings of its Muhammadan subjects, and it should be correctly infonlied of the feelings of Indian Muslims in the matter. * * r( 593 ) The Arab revolt. t ^ ie ^ohilkhand Gazette (Bareilly) of the 1st July, 1916, the editor expresses iadignation at the Arab revolt. ^ He views with disapprobation the action of the Sheriff of Mecca in causing human slaughter within the precints of Mecca where even the killing of animals is prohibited. • ^ He says that the news of the Arab revolt has caused a sensation ampng Indian Muhammadans and has filled their hearts with indignation and contempt. He asserts that it is a violation of shariat and for this reason every Muham madan looks upon the Sheriff and his supporters as the enemies of Islam. He is sanguine that the Ottoman Government will easily put down the revolt. He discredits the report that some Muhammadans have welcomed the news, and says that if the report is correct no importance should be attached to their attitude. 9. In the Nai Roshni (Allahabad) of the 2nd July, 1^16, the editor The Arab revolt refers to the comment of the (Allahabad) on the Arab revolt and says that in suggesting that the Arabs should seek the protection of the British in maintaining their independence the Leader has made an indirect attempt to create suspicion in the minds of Indian Muhammadans that Britain was secretly in intrigue with the Arabs. He invites attention to the fact that ever since the outbreak of the war Government has, by declaring that the sanctity of the sacred places of Islam will be respected, tried to prevent the growth of sueh suspicions in the minds of the Muslims of India. He urges Government to warn the Leader not to mar the noble policy of Government by irrelevant and uncalled for expressions of loyalty. 10. A correspondent who signs himself “ M. M.” writes from Dharmpur to the Indian Daily Telegraph (Lucknow) of the The Arab revolt. 4 th July, 1916, on the subject of the Arab revolt. The writer says that he is glad to hear that the Lucknow Muslims are perturbed at the news of the revolt. He says that the rebels cannot be regarded as good Muslims. He says that what he is afraid of is that this is the beginning of the Egyptian Caliphate and that the outside world is responsible for the revolt. He asks his co-religionists in India to beg Government to keep strictly loyal to its announcement that the holy places would not be interfered with. He says that it is the duty of Muslims to ask Government “to influence the situation” as Muslims cannot suffer the humiliation of seeing the holy places / in the protection of non-Muslims, including the British. ' The Prem (Brindaban, Muttra) of the 5th July, 1916, refers to the Arab revolt, and remarks tha.t the tyranny of the Turks has led the Grand Sheriff to proclaim his independence. The editor expresses regret that the Indian Muhammadans have held meetings to protest against the action of the Sheriff on the ground that the Arab revolt will cause harm to the holy places of Islam. He observes that the Arab revolt has made the Hedjaz pilgrimage more convenient and enquires why Muslims express indignation at it. He says that it is possible that there may be some bloodshed at present owing to unrest, but. there will be peace and order when the Arab control becomes firm at Mecca. He says that the British Government has already assured the Muhammadans that it will protect their sacred places, and Indians should be gratified at the news of the revolt. 12.

The Oudh Akhbar (Lucknow) of the 2nd July, 1916, refers to the Compulsory Military Service Act recently passed compulsory military service. an( j remarks that some people tried to evade enlistment for the army on the ground that their conscience did not allow them to go on active service. The editor observes that the so-called conscientions objectors are allowed to enter the Indian Civil Service, and enquires how those men who avoid their national duties, can work faithfully in India. /■ 15. The Abhyndaya (Allahabad) of the 1st July, 1916, says that the Irish rebellion conveys two lessons, namely that The insh rebellion. the policy of repression is harmful and the best interests of the rulers and the ruled are best served by mutual love, trust and friendship. The fact that all the British Statesmen are unanimous that Home Rule should be conceded to Ireland without delay shows that they have realised that if the Irish had been granted Home Rule they would not have risen against England despite all the attempts of Sinn Eeiners and the Germans. 16.

The editor says that if Government looks upon all those who are working for self-government as seditionists, it will find more seditionists among educated Indians than loyalists, for educated Indians are convinced that they are wholly fit for self-government, and that the time has come for them to demand Home Rule. In conclusion the editor says “ Educated India is moved by the same impulse, governed by the same senti ments and inspired by the same spirit, to enable the motherland to enjoy her long-denied birthright of self-government within the Empire.” 17. The Prem (Brindaban, Muttra), of the 5th July, 1916, says that Indians „ - t a' h ave 80 l° n £ been blind followers of conservatism Self-government that in spife of being deprived of their political rights, they do not wish to get rid of slavery. But they are now awakening and are demanding their rights. He observes that Indians now want to progress side by side with other nations. The educated Indians demand self-government and think that they are fit for it. The editor urges that this is the time to give them the opportunity to work independently as otherwise they can neither show their excellence owing to subjection nor can they make any progress. He says that by self-government Indians do not mean severance with the English. They merely wish to be allowed to rule India under the aegis of the British Government. He asks the party which opposes self-government to consider who is really ruling over India, and enquires whether India is not practically governed by Indian officers.

The equivocal attitude of Japan may land India in complete impoverish ment. Bombay Gujarati (50), 2nd July. It tiap now come to our knowledge that Japan is being helped by the Germans in its endeavours to capture Indian trade. If Japan means to keep the Allies in the dark in this matter it may be said that it takes away money from the pockets of Indians and indi rectly helps the Germans. This may lead to the complete impoverishment of India. It is a sorry sight for Britain that the aliens should carry away the produce of India which rightfully belongs to the King-Emperor It reflects discredit on our rulers that India should suffer from commercial famine when Europe is involved in war. 10. The ATihbdr-e-Isldm is of opinion that during the current Hai season very few Muhammadans would be going on a pilgrimage to Mecca owing to the continuance of the war and the dearth of steamers and that the Musafar- khanas in Bombay would under the circumstances remain unutilised. It, therefore, requests the trustees of the two important ones among them to place them at the disposal of Government for being tempo rarily converted into war hospitals. It reminds the Muhammadans of the Quranic injunction for the care of the wounded and asks the wealthy to place their mansions at the disposal of Government for war-hospital purposes and to help Government in diverse othemways -oktl-mwar. ’ Suggestion that the two principal Musafarkhanas of Bombay be placed at the disposal of Govern ment to be used as war hospitals.

It was the weakness of the Turkish Government which was responsible for their mal treatment in spite of the noble assurance given by the British to keep the holy places inviolate.

Contributing a letter to the Praja Mitra and Pdrsi, an anonymous correspondent refers to the belief entertained in some quarters that the political prestige of the Anjuman-e- Islam has greatly suffered and attributes the fact to the leaders of that body expressing their opinion when they should not and to their remaining silent when they should speak out. The writer refers to the reticence of the Anjuman on the question of the revolt of the Sherif of Mecca which has pained Moslem hearts, as witness the opinions expressed by the different branches of the Moslem League. He asks what the leaders of the Bhendi Bazar meeting of 10,000 Muhammadans that met to protest against the Bombay session of the J^oslem League are busy thinking about. 13-.—Gommentiftg 1 oa- H4s- -Excellanc-y Lord -Wiflmgdon , &amp; -recent speech at the Sirdars’ Durbar, the Kesari observes -People are glad K to hear Lord Willingdon as he speaks clearly an&lt;i plainly in a gentle, suave and hutnorous manner. His advice to the Sirdars awakening them to a sense of duty was founded on his experience and was well-deserved. But his reference to the discon tinuance of return visits was not as satisfactory and agreeable as it ought to have been. When Peshwai itself was destroyed its Sirdars had no legal right to ask that they Comments on Lord Willingdon’s^ speech to the Sirdars of the Deccan. Kesari (90), 4th July; Islamic Mail (4), 2nd July, Eng. edition. i16 should be honoured in a particular manner by Government. We also admit that it was out of generosity that Government continue to respect them by returning their calls, etc. But we do not think that the Sirdars have com mitted any fault deserving the discontinuance of the return visits from this year. It is within the competence of Government to create as many or as few First Class Sirdars as they like but we much regret to note that the usage of paying return visits to First Class Sirdars has been stopped by Government. What can it be but a sign-of the loss of self-respect on the part of the people and of the arrogance of the officials that there should be no one in the whole popu lation of the Bombay Presidency including Princes^ and Sirdars who can of right claim to be visited by His Excellency? We think that the innovation deserves the severest condemnation from the point of view of courteousness. Though there are numerous Sirdars on the list we do not think many come down to Poona and visit His Excellency obliging him to pay the return visit. We do not think that His Excellency has to devote more than three or four hours in a year to this business. Some Sirdars may not be able to arrange for the return visit in a way befitting the dignity of His Excellency. But such persons should not be created First Class Sirdars. It is unjust that all should lose their privilege because of the silliness or foolishness of a solitary Sirdar or two. It would have been better if His Excellency had not alluded to another controversial point in his speech. He said that all political controversies should be stopped during war time but he seems to have forgotten the behaviour of Government themselves before advising people to be good. We should like to hear of a single thing being dropped by Government because of its controversial nature. Even amidst the din of war the enforcement of many harassing laws goes on. The local scheme of the commutation of the kulkarni watan was hatched during war time and the amendment of the Consolidation Act withdrawing the privileges of the people was introduced during war time and yet His Excellency advises the people not to raise controversial issues. While the Colonial Secretary says that he is waiting for proposals from the colonies for the recon stitution of the British Empire after the war, our Government are engaged in trying to condemn even honest endeavours for the discussion of Home Buie branding it ‘ discontent and dis satisfaction.’ Even when war is going on in all its fierceness at a distance of a hundred miles Home Buie for Ireland is being discussed in England. How are we to characterise the pretence of the officials that they are quite upset with the philosophical discussion of Home Buie which only breaks the death-like silence of India ? [The Islamic Mail publishes-a lengthy article.in Which it gives a resume of His Excellency the Governor’s speech at the Sirdars' Durbar at Poona. The paper praises the charm of His Excellency’s oratory and congratulates him on the £ wisdom, foresight and liberality ’ of the announcement about schemes in contemplation for securing employ ment for soldiers returned from the front and for making grants of land to those who have performed meritorious service. It considers the most important part of the speech to be that £ which deals with the com pact made between the Government and the public to suspend all controversial discussions ’ during the period of the war. The article concludes as follows :—“ It was this consideration which prompted us to oppose the idea of a Moslem League Session in Bombay and it is also due to that that have postponed the discussion of political questions of a nature likely to arouse controversy. Our friends think that the Hindus who keep up their boisterous agitation will win all the political concessions, as they already appear to be doing, and we would be left in the lurch; but they must have confidence and trust in the British sense of justice and fairplay which has stood them in good stead in the past and is sure to come to their rescue in the fight for concessions ; itffias never failed us in the past and in spite of all that Lord Hardinge may have said, is not likely to fail us in future. No one can be more directly connected with the war than ourselves. Our brothers and sons are sacrificing their lives for the sirltar and it is our duty to do all that we can to secure victory for them. It is as much a personal concern as our loyal duty, and those who do not realise this are not only traitors but heartless enemies of their own near and dear ones ? ”] %I—Foreign Politics. The Nay ale (Calcutta) of the 28th June is surprised that the Musalmans of “ Mecca and Medina.” Arabia should have risen against the Turkish Gov- ernment. Turkey is fighting with great heroism against England, the greatest country m the world, has driven a Christian Power out of Gallipoli and Kut-el-Amara, and has kept General Townshend a prisoner at the latter place. There is, therefore, nothing in the Arab revolt which may cause rejoicings in the Moslem world. The late Sultan of Turkey did much to facilitate the pilgrimage to Hedjaz. It is a well-known fact that the existence of Moslem dominion in the world depends solely on Turkey being victorious in the war, for otherwise England and Russia will divide Turkey between themselves. The present situation in Asia Minor is such, that if Russia continues extending her power and Turkey is weakened under Hun influence, Mecca will perhaps pass into the hands of the Christian Huns. England has always been a protector of religions. Arabia has been obliged to rise against Turkey out of consideration for her own future. Besides, this event will help the English to weaken German power. The Musalmans of India and Egypt are loyal to England; and if the Musalmans of Arabia also take the British side, Turkey s downfall will have no effect on Musalman interests. It will be a very good thing if the holy places of Mecca and Medina pass into the hands of the Koreish dynasty. Indeed, the loss of these two places is as disgraceful to Turkey as its possession by the Koreish dynasty will enhance the dignity of the Moslem world. 2. Referring to the telegram of Maulvi Abdul Bari, of Lucknow, to the ■rn i •. ,. ... , Private Secretary to His Excellency the Viceroy, bv the s“Ve 1 e; n a depe ' den0e in connection with the declaration of independence by the Sherif of Mecca, the Sadaqat (Calcutta) of the 29th June says :— The question of the Caliphate is an all-important one in the Islamic world. Its gravity has been recognised by the Government itself. When the ques tion was brought up in Parliament, at the commencement of the war, the Government, out of regard for the feeling of its Moslem subjects, did not think it proper to discuss it. No doubt the Moslems take the Turko-British war as a calamity and a catastrophe, but the British Government is not uiiaware of the fact that the Moslems, in spite of the Sultan of Turkey being the custodian and protector of Mecca and Medina, do not look upon him with the same reverence and respect as they did .before the war. This rever ence and respect has nothing to do with the personality of the Sultan, but with his services to Mecca and Medina. Now, if the Sherif wants to acquire that honour for himself, naturally, it will be a very great change. Such changes cannot but cause anxiety to the Moslems. 3. The Dainik Bharat Mitra (Calcutta) of the 2nd July says :— lbid The Moslem League has protested against the declaration of independence by the Sherif of Mecca. This feeling of the League seems to be shared by all thoughtful Indian Moslems, but Lord Crewe and Lord Cromer have expressed their approval of the Sherif’s conduct. It would not be well for us to express our opinion on the subject, because it is a question which has close connection with the spiritual requirements of the Moslems who do not want that their holy places should pass out of the hands of the present custodians of the heritage left by the Prophet. There is ample historical evidence to show that the Sherif of Mecca has never been held in honour by the Moslems. 4. The Hitavadi (Calcutta) of the 30th June does not exactly know 41 Arabian independence.” whether the fact of Arabia throwing off the Turkish yoke will please or displease the Musal man community; but since the Englishman and other papers are rejoicing over the event, the paper is inclined to think that Arabia’s declaration of independence is favourable to the interests of the Allies. Nayak, June 28th, 1916# Sada^at, June 29th, 1916 Dainik bhakat MiTRA, July 2nd* 1916. HITAVADI, June 30th, 1916.924 [SADAQAT, July 2u(l, 1916. 5. DAIHIK BA MTjMATI, July 3rd. 1916. It The Sadaqai (Calcutta) of the 2nd July says : We have already said that there cannot be Sherif of Mecca’s declaration of an y even t, so sad for the Moslems of India as the independence and the problem of ^ p regent war created a Very Sad holy place8 ‘ change in the relations existing between Britain and Turkey. We are affected by this change simply because our fate is bound up with that of the two countries in question. While one is our pro tector, the other is the guardian of the holy places. This is why the Indian Moslems have ever been anxious for the maintenance of good relations between them. It is our conviction that if we wish to stand among the rising nations of the world, we should maintain our connection closely with England, because by loving her alone we can reach the summit of our desires. When we look from the Moslem standpoint, then it becomes clear to us that the solidarity of the Moslems depends upon the fact that the Moslems should make Mecca and Medina the centre of all their hopes and supplications. Under the circum stances we have to show our deepest respect to the Sultan of Turkey. In spite of this connection with the Sultan, the conduct of the Moslems since the declaration of war has been so good that even the Imperial Government had to acknowledge it. This should be considered a severe test of the practical loyalty of the Moslems. Thank God that Moslems have not been found wanting. # . The Moslems were just becoming used to the new condition of things during the war when suddenly and in a most unexpected fashion the declara tion of independence by the Sherif came upon them like a great surprise. But there is nothing to wonder at in this. The Turks and Arabs have been at variance for a long time. Taking advantage of the present difficulties of Turkey, the Arabs want to establish an independent State. No one can say how far the Sherif will succeed in this. No one, whether a Moslem or a non-Moslem, can deny this fact, that the action of the Sherif of Mecca is pure and simple rebellion against Turkey. His action is capable of no other interpretation. If this rebellion had only a political aspect, then we would have called him a great rebel like Sir % Roger Casement, but in the eyes of the Moslem world, the action of the Sherif is more heinous than this, because this action of his has created the apprehension that the holy places may become the scene of bloodshed. It is especially forbidden in the Koran to shed blood in the holy places. Should not then the Sherif be considered an enemy of Islam who is going to involve these holy places ? We are extremely grateful to the All-India Moslem League and Maulana Abdul Bari for expressing their indignation and abhorrence at the conduct of the Sherif of Mecca, and we hope that other Moslem Anjumans will follow the lead of the Moslem League. The problem of the holy places is a purely religious one and has no connection with war, and we can deal with it in perfect freedom. We distinctly remember that when the Italians during the Tripolian war wanted to make an aerial raid on the holy places, the British Government exerted its influence and prevented them from doing so. When the British Government has got such a consideration for the feelings of its Muhammadan subjects, then we believe that it will prevent the Sherif from doing any thing which will endanger the holy places. 6. The Dainik Basumati (Calcutta) of the 3rd July is surprised at the hasty opinion expressed by the All-India Moslem M 08 iIm e L^ r gue.” reV0lt and the League on the Arab revolt and observes The gentlemen responsible for the expression of this opinion do not seem to have given the question any careful considera tion. The S.herif of Mecca is ^s good a Musalman as the members of the Moslem League, nor is there any reason to suppose that the Musalmans of Arabia and Egypt are in any way lacking in devotion to Islam. Now if the Arab revolt can commend itself to the peoples of Arabia and Egypt, what can there be in it for the Moslem League to find fault with ? The question whether after the dethronement of Abdul Hamid by the Young Turks the present Sultan of Turkey can justly be looked upon as the Caliph, has not yet been satisfactorily decided by the Moslem world. The Musalmans of India-'-f 925 supported the action of the Young Turks when they dethroned Abdul Hamid Later on they found fault with them (the Young Turks) for not being strict adherents of the Islamic faith, because of their having insulted the Shekh-ul- Islam and taken the side of the Kaiser, who is a non-Musalman When Turkey joined the war, the Musalmans of India said that in such a case they were not prepared to accept the Caliphate of the Sultan, so they ouo-ht not now to take a strong exception to the action of the Sherif of Mecca. We fail to find any justification for the fear expressed by the Moslem League as to the sanctity and safety of the holy places in Hedjaz and Mesopotamia beino- threatened by the Arab revolt. Have the Young Turks ever been able to protect these places ? In fact, it is due to them that there has of late been a state of anarchy in Hedjaz and Mesopotamia. What reason is there for the Moslem League to suppose that the Sherif of Mecca will not be able to establish peace and good government? If the Musalmans of Arabia, Syria and Egypt, who being practically “ men on the spot ” and having an intimate knowledge of the state of affairs in Hedjaz can support the revolt, we do not think the Moslem League should have taken a different view, especially in an important political question like this. 7. The Sadaqat (Calcutta) of the 4th July says :— mi i i , We regret very much that the opinion P 1 expressed by Lords Crewe and Cromer in regard to the rebellion of the Sherif of Mecca and the protection of holy places is altogether against Moslem sentiment, and are at a loss to understand what justification they had for dealing with the ques tion of the protectorate of the holy places of Hedjaz and Mesopotamia, seeing that the British Government itself has declared the present war as one ex clusively prompted by political considerations. If we remember aright when an attempt was made to discuss the question in Parliament, the Government stopped it and issued a declaration to the effect that the British Government is only opposed to the present Turkish administration and not to the spiritual headship of the Sultan of Turkey. We recognise the fact that Turkey did not do well in joining Germany. It would have been better if she had sided with England. She will have to suffer for her mistakes. But all this does not in the least affect the spiritual position of Turkey. Lord Crewe thinks that the action of the Sherif of Mecca will secure increased conveniences to the Hajis. He also says that it has been the wish of the British Govern ment to maintain Moslem dignity in the holy places. Does Lord Crewe think that this is not the case now ? Does he think that the Sultan of Turkey is not a Moslem? Does he think that a rebel official of the Sultan of Turkey is capable of becoming the custodian of the holy places ? Vvdll this rebel command the respect that the Sultan of Turkey does? We consider the opinion of Lords Crewe and Cromer as their individual opinions only and not that of the English Government.

The paper would mther think that the Special Branch of the Crimma Intelligence Department should be abolished, anarchists should be tried just like orfinary criminals, steps should be taken to do away with the hatred which the public have for the Criminal Investigation Department, and police- men should be made to consider themselves to be the servants and not the masters of the public.

Those who commit these murders have some eye for theatrical effect- They ^ve mur dered police officers at the Grey Street crossing, at the entrance to S^dar Ba^an Lane, near Cornwallis Square, inside College Square, m the High Court m front of the Medical College—in fact m nearly every prominent place in Calcutta. They have killed high police officers m the morning, at midday, in the afternoon and after evening—m fact at all hours of the day and under all circumstances—when markets are being held, when the streets are crowded, when marriage processions are passing, when people after enioying the day’s amusement are sitting down to their meals. 1 hey do not kill men in the old style at dead of night, m dark lanes- Indirectly they are saying to the police : “We shall kill you before everybody s eyes and vou will be able to do nothing.” As a matter of fact, thel police have not been able to do anything so far. They have killed or attempted to kill all kinds of Government officials, from Lord Hardinge down to a Head-constable, but up till now, none of the offenders^iave been caught by the police m the act. They have not been able to get anybody convicted on unquestioned evidence. Those who have surrendered themselves or have done the deed m desperation, reckless of their own lives, have alone been caught. Otherwise, the police so far have not been able to detect and arrest any offender and secure his conviction. These facts suggest that these murders are committed after/ a good deal of forethought and preparation. In order that these crimes may be com mitted, the assistance of a good many outsiders has to be enlisted. _ After all, the youthful murderers are not gods and cannot, at will, vanish into the air. Whither did the three murderers of Madhusudan Bhattacharyya vanish m broad daylight? Whither did the murderers of Basanta Kumar Chatterji disappear before the eyes of so many people? From their speedy disappearance in every case we must infer that they arrange previously for hiding places near the scene of each crime. It is of course true that their revolvers frighten away many people, who deliberately shut their eyes to their movements, but in order to secure these hiding places, the assistance of other people has to be obtained. These anarchists have their spies incessantly present among the police themselves. They in fact know more about the police than the police do about them. This is proved by these murders and the failure of the police to detect the murderers. These repeated murders of policemen have created a terror among policemen—everyone believes that Government cannot protect its own officers and the anarchists can kill anybody they choose. This feeling of terror impairs the efficiency of the force. The Statesman endorses our view in this respect, and this fact may now possibly induce the authorities to tread the right path. It is doubtful if the real assassins in this case will be caught. During the past five months there was a suspension of these crimes and hence semi official statements appeared that the numerous internments had succeeded in putting a stop to anarchism. It was ridiculous. You have not been able r942 —.roimiwa. Auv /^A Di I^IK Basumati, July Ird, 1916. Dainik Basumaix J uly 3rd, 1916.

The Indian Musalnins/ it is said, look upon the Arabian revolt as a great wrong. On the other side the act is being supported through the mouths of Egyptian Musalmans. On the 27th June a public meeting was held m the Nakhoda Mosque m Oalcutta. In this meeting the Musalmans strongly disapproved of the Orand bherif s action and expressed their apprehension that the safety and sanctity of Mecca and other places of pilgrimage would be destroyed. Un fortunately these Musalmans did not consider that whatever was done in the interest of Government must be accepted as good. In the great Hindu poem called Chandi there are many exciting expressions. If Govern ment thinks that they may do harm and prohibits the recitation of “ Chandi ” must we not consider such prohibition a good act on the part of Government and obey it with bowed heads? Compared with this, the Arabian revolt against Turkey is nothing. There is no risk of Mecca and other places passing out of the hands of Musalmans in consequence of this revolt, and' at the same time it is likely to benefit our Government. 68. The Damik Hasumati (Calcutta) of the 3rd July* gives an account “ Russia.” fh 0 fighting on the Russian front and writes :— . _ The Germans who have checked the Russian advance in Volhynia and have entrenched themselves strongly there, can assume the offensive whenever they like. Latest telegrams show that no remarkable change is taking place anywhere except on the frontiers of Bukhovina and Galicia. The enemy is trying his best to check the Russian advance in Bukhovina and we may soon expect very heavy fighting in this region. There is no chancq of any change taking place in the fighting that is going on in the Pinsk marshes. 69.

One section of the German attacking force is pressing towards Hills 320 and 321, a second is pushing towards Froideterre through the region between these two hills and the Sauville Fort, and a third is trying to take Eleury. They will gain a distinct advantage if they can take Froideterre, for then it will be easy for them to take Verdun. If, however, the French can put up a counter-attack in the Froiderterre region, the German advance will be checked and the third section of the German attacking party is likely to be defeated. It is in the Thiaumont region that the fighting is very intense, and if, as a result of this, the French line can be pushed back to 1 Froideterre, which is only two and a half miles from Verdun, the latter place will be easily occupied by the Germans. The French are putting up a very stub born resistance and the Germans also are attacking them vigorously. 70. The Charu Mihir (Mymensingh) of the 27th June writes :— Self-governmeut in India. T 1 . Tha h °P eS - Wl }l ch man J ° f US cherished, of India obtaining self-government after the war have beeen shattered by the views recently expressed on the question by Mr. Asquith and Lord Islington. India’s loyal devotion to the British Raj has evoked the admiration of the entire English nation, not excepting those who, previous to the war, used to think that the majority of the people of this country were disloyal, and who never lost an opportunity to incite Anglo-Indian officials to persecute them. Even the brilliant proof which 'T» / / \ 3^) if i0 “ A few words with the war.” in connection hearty help, and India is ready to send large armies to fight her battles the moment she will permit her to do so. The manner in which India has, at present, discarded so-called revolutionary ideas and calmly applied herself to the service of her Sovereign is astonishing. She has not been guilty of the foolish rashness of Ireland. The coolness and judgment with which the British Ministers, headed by Mr. Asquith, are conducting the war elicits praise from everybody. Lord Kitchener is dead. But there are still lakhs of Lord Kitcheners among Englishmen. It is a pity that His Lordship did not live to see England's final triumph. The fall of the Kaiser, like that of Napolean, is inevitable. England possesses all the physical and mental qualities and all the material resources which ensure victory. The present war is most deplorable and many people are anxious to see its end; but it must be remembered that it is the effect of Europe’s materialism, which will last so long as the power derived from material science endures. For God destroys the nation which, in cultivating material science and seeking material welfare, forgets Him. England, however, is not an enemy of God and does not, like Germany, want to desolate the world by war. 64. The Bangali (Calcutta) of the 30th June says that the Civil and a tit a ■ t a- Military Gazette has advised Government to appoint a War Board m India. But who will bear its cost ? Not of course the Civil and Military Gazette. 65. Germany, writes the Nayak (Calcutta) of the 30th June, w is deter mined to take Verdun at any^cost. This is proved by the news that the strength of the German force attacking Verdun is being doubled in men and munitions. When Verdun has been taken it will not be difficult for Germany to defeat the French. The Germans are fighting vigorously not only the French at Verdun but also the English at Loos. La Basse and Ypres. We Hindus have no particular interest in this European war. Nevertheless, we derive some pleasure out of it and estimate our profit and loss in the rise and fall of Europe. The Aryan Hindu power cannot possibly compete, that is to say, quarrel with the Western Mlechcha power; for if it does so, the Hindu race will lose its dharma; but the Hindus ought to watch what the civilised Westerners do. News has come of the recent sinking of some more vessels, and reports from London state that there is great want of money in Germany. We are unable to understand the meaning of these reports. The doings of the Sherif of Mecca have caused rejoicing in India. We, however, think that it is impudent on our part, insignificant as we are, to dance at the sight of the dancing of great peoples. Why should the Indian Musalmans show agitation at Arab independence? We can simply express joy at the victory of the English. Otherwise, we have no connection with the rise and fall of any other nation. What we ought to do during this war is to develop our arts and industries and improve our own condition in every way. 66. Referring to General Lake’s report that English prisoners are receiving very good treatment in Turkey, the Samay (Calcutta) of the 1st July writes :— English officers are being given one-third their pay. Wk cannot praise this gift, for while these English officers are being unjustly held in duress, it is an additional injustice to put them to pecuniary Joss or place the charge of compensating this loss on England. Again, the English officers are being allowed to move about with servants and other men. This is as it should be. For when there is a possibility of Turkey coming under the sovereignty of England after the war, it is an act of wisdom to give English officers an opportunity to know the country.

After pointing out that there is nothing common between the Arabs Arabia and Turkey. ?? d . the i rurks e^ept that they are both Muhammadans, and that the former have been dissatisfied with the administration of their country by the latter, the Kerala \ Patrika, of the 1st July, observes that the news of the declaration of inde pendence by the Arabs is likely to be hailed with joy by all Muhammadans but the Turks, as it will remove all obstacles to their free access to the sacred places of Mecca and Medina, and that it will tend to diminish the power of Turkey by half. 28. The Qaumi Report, of the 29th June, in continuation of its previous issues, gives a sketch of the history of Arabia and writes that the British Government, which is a Christian Power, has solemlnly promised thy Mussulmans that the)' will protect the holy places of Islam. If the Government, which is the friend of Islam, had not been so considerate and sympathetic, God alone knows what would have happened by now. The natural result of this occurrence is that most Mussalmans have forgotten the Turks and have begun to complain against the Arabs. Really this enlightenment and sympathy are worthy of all praise. We do not say this event is remarkable because the Arabs have inopportunely changed sides, but we are of opinion tfyat in what they have done they have been actuated by political, rather than by religious, motives. It has not yet been ascertained what religious grievances the Arabs have, or how the sacred law has been wrested to sanction their procedure. If in reality this idea of independence has been prompted by political aims and motives, it is advisable for us to await in silence for future develop ment, and let God judge between them, u For is not God the supreme Judge ? ” The Qaumi Report, of the 2nd July, gives “in continuation ’ 7 a sketch of Arabian history and observes:— The tumult of the rising in jy ou ^ 0 f pl ace and inopportune to discuss the desert of Arabia. h er e Turkish politics and civilisation ; our object is simply to prove that Arab Government has never been, nor is it likely to be, beneficial. According to British books of Travel and the accounts of travellers Arabian administration was never regarded as of any utility. It is an historical taunt that the Arabs would not have lost the Spanish Khalifate if they had been able to rule. The Arabs doubtless have the right to rule the followers of^ Islam, but in this modern age they will find it difficult to establish their claims to that right until such time as the^y educate themselves and become civilised. The matter for most apprehension will be that certain Mussalman States and administrations will not be able to recognise the Arab Government because they have foolishly made Mecca and Medina their centres of war. If they desired to declare their independence of Turkish rule they might have issued such announcement from some other province. As the Arabs have, however, drawn the sword in the sacred territory of God and the Apostle, they has r e by this act of theirs and by laying siege to Medina violated Sasilhkha, Madrat, June 30th, 191S, Kerala Patriia, Calicut, July 1st, 1916. 4 Qiujii Report, Madras, June 29th, 1916.

These are the reasons why most Mussalmans condemn the procedure of the Arabs and express their regret at, and detestation of their mad act. It appears from the telegrams that the 1 urkish garnson have been taken nrisoners If this be true, the Arab affair becomes more detestable, for, to the generality of Muhammadans, it means that the Turks did not consider it lawful to shed blood in the holy places. It is these tilings that will make a disagreeable impression on the public and create anxiety among the people. Most Muhammadans consider it to be a very grave occurrence and that the Arabs are entirely to blame. Apparently the religions importance and sacred* influence of the holy places have created this sensational impression upon people’s minds that the Arabs have proclaimed their independence and at the same time, invited the Turks to stay in the sacred territoi}. We frankly say that these ideas are baseless and that there is nothing in the occurrence, and we should not pay much attention to it, for history records several similar incidents. There have been revolts and rebellions in the holy places before.. „ .. . The writer observes with regret that the contempoiaiy imigiish papeis, which are unacquainted with both the Muslim mind and the spirit of Islam, are o-uilty of egregious blunders in this matter. For example, the Statesman, of the 25th June, stated that the Arab revolt had created a feeling of joy among the Mussalmans of Calcutta, but the telegraphic messages of yesterday show that the Mussalmans of Calcutta repudiated the statement at a public meeting. On the 29th June the paper published the opinion of two Madras Mussalmans, but we and our local contemporaries, m spite ot being on the spot in Madras, have not been able to hear “their voices”. We fear this information also is more or less as false as the report regarding the reputed feeling of the Calcutta Mussalmans ! In any case no individual or combined Muslim opinion can nullify the divine commands, Koranic texts, the traditions of the Apostle of God, the . sacred law and the consensus of opinion of the Muslim community.

The Jaridah-i-Rozgar, of the -0th June, writes :—There is no doubt “ A German newspaper’s testimony to the might of Great Britain.” Jaridah-i-Rozgab , Madras, July let, 1916. that the Government, whose subjects we have the pride and honour of being, is a powerful one. Its strength and vast resources have been realized, not only by the Allies but also by the enemy. Reference has frequently been made in our columns to the British Kaval power and resources. Every Indian is perfectly aware that it is on account of Britain alone that the Allies are still facing the enemy success fully, repulsing their attacks and inflicting irreparable losses on them. The enemy is aware that the courage, fortitude, and perseverance of the Allies are daily increasing. A German newspaper the Ko Ini she Zeitung expresses plainly and openly that much speculation is rife as to the Russian menace, and states that the Germans are threatened with disaster on the British Front. The paper further remarks that the resources ancksupplies of England are so enormous that the like lias never been dreamt of. \There is no doubt that the prepara tions for a big offensive which the Germans dread will shortly commence. 'Phis British offensive will be on a large scale. The German paper accordingly advises its national military leaders not to pay so much attention to the Eastern Campaign, but to concentrate their united efforts upon the Western Front otherwise they (the Germans) will find themselves involved in great difficulties. From this it may be concluded that the might of our kind Government is appreciated by the enemy’s press, and that they fear new developments from the Allied offensive and that the scales will turn in favour of Great Britain. 30. The Jaridah-i-Rozgar, of the 1st July, writes :—Recently history has Whose will he the finalfvictory ? / been placing before the world the fact that in order to reach the glittering peaks of victory! / 1135 rivei^ o f blood will have to flow. In the Russo-Japanese war the storming of Rmt Arthur was the most sanguinary struggle in the whole campaign and m the Lalkan struggle the battle around Adrianople in the last phase of the campaign was the most desperate battle of the war. In the present world-war the aim of the Germans is to concentrate their energies on Verdun but the brave forces of the Allies have absolutely baffled all their attempts and prevented them from advancing a single inch. In the shambles of Verdun hundreds oi thousands of Germans have been slain and daily scores of trainloads of German dead may be seen passing. In fact, the enemv’s loss is irreparable. Proceeding, the writer remarks Taking into consideration the present progress of the war and Military and Naval strength of Great Britain Military experts opine that side will be victorious which is supported by Great Britain. In political circles also the same opinion prevails for Great Britain has neither wronged ayy one nor coveted any territory nor attempted to ruin any.

If the cost of Police administration is to be reduced, reforms such as the reduction in the number of higher officers in the department and in their pay, and the abolition of unnecessary expenditure in the name of the Criminal Investigation Department should be effected. There is no use starving the subordinate officers. Besides raising the pay of constables, the Government should take steps to make the department popular, so that the educated classes may enter it. The police should so conduct themselves that the people will not look upon them with a suspicious eyh. There must be mutual confidence between the police and the people, and so leug as this is wanting, there is no use giving the constables an increase in their pay except that it enables them to provide themselves with some comforts of life, which they justly deserve.

Referring to an article said to have been written by the New Statesnian published in England, advocating Reforms in education. a pp 0 i n t m ent of a Royal Commission to consider and report on the lines on which education has to be imparted after the end of the war, the Swadesam$tran, of the 30th June, remarks:—If in England itself, which is the chief factor in the British Empire, the necessity has arisen to reform the system of education thoroughly, much need not be said of the necessity for reforming it in India, which is behind the majority of the countries in the world in The matter of education. The New States man regrets that only seven million children, out of 4 52 millions, which is the population of Great Britain, are having primary education in England. Compare this with India, wher# the number of students having education in general in 1914-15 was only 7,450,000 out of a population of 243 millions. One of the reasons why education has not spread in India is the absence of a sufficient number of schools ^nd colleges in the country. Another reason, whicli seems to apply to the ease of England also, is the fact that the poorer classes find it necessary to make their sons earn their livelihood quite early in life and cannot therefore send them to school. The suggestion of the New Statesman that scholarships! should be freely awarded in order to make it possible for the intelligent Jhildren of poor people to have education is well worth being noted by ever# one here. 36. The Andhrapatriki, of the 1st July, comments on the great progress xa n i i a- t made in education in Baroda, and remarks :— Tree and compulsory education. ,. • -..a, , , , , It is dimcult to understand why m the British Provinces, the British (Government have not made a law similar to the Compulsory Education 4ct now in force in Baroda.

Tucked away at the back of Mr. Britling’s conscious ness was something that had not always been there, something warm and comforting that made life and his general thoughts about life much easier and pleasanter than they would otherwise have been, the sense of a neatly arranged investment list, a shrewdly and geo graphically distributed system of holdings in national loans, municipal investments, railway debentures, that had amounted altogether to rather over five-and-twenty thousand pounds; his and Mrs. Britling’s, a joint accumulation. It was, so to speak, his economic viscera. It sustained him, and kept him going and comfortable. When all was well he did not feel its existence; he had merely a pleasant sense of general well-being. When here or there a security got a little disarranged he felt a vague discomfort. Now he became aware of grave disorders. It was as if he had discovered he had been accidentally eating toadstools, and didn’t quite know whether they weren’t a highly poisonous sort. But an analogy may be carried too far. . . » At any rate, when Mr. Britling got back to his writing-desk he was much too disturbed to resume “ And Now War Ends.” “ There’s bound to be a tremendous change in values!’ ’ Pie had never felt quite so sure as most people about the stability of the modern financial system. He did not, he felt, understand the working of this moratorium, or the peculiar advantage of prolonging the bank holi days. It meant, he supposed, a stoppage of payment all round, and a cutting off of the supply of ready money. And Plickson the grocer, according to Mrs. Faber, was already looking askance at cheques. Even if the bank did reopen Mr. Britling was aware that his current balance was low; at the utmost it amounted to twenty or thirty pounds. He had been expecting cheques from his English and American publishers, and the usual “Times” cheque. Suppose these payments were intercepted ! All these people might, so far as he could under stand, stop payment under this moratorium! That hadn’t at first occurred to him. But, of course, quite probably they might refuse to pay his account when it fell due. And suppose the “Times ” felt his peculiar vein of thoughtfulness unnecessary in these stirring days! And then if the bank really did lock up his deposit account, and his securities became unsaleable! Mr. Britling felt like an oyster that is invited to leave its shell. . . . He sat back from his desk contemplating these things. His imagination made a weak attempt to picture a world in which credit has vanished and money is of doubtful value. He supposed a large number of people would just go on buying and selling at or near the old prices by force of habit. His mind and conscience made a valiant attempt to pick up “ And Now War Ends ” and go on with it, tut before five minutes were out he was back at the thoughts of food panic and bankruptcy. (To be continued.) Hitters to the (Eiitor. THE SULTAN AND THE CALIPHATE. To the Editor of TEE NATION, Sir,—I missed the first letter of Sir Edwin Pears in your paper on the above subject, but I have read the Right Hon. Syed Ameer Alt’s learned letter of the 8th and its reply by Sir Edwin Pears of the 15th. As a Sunni Muslim what I should like to make clear to the Press and the public in these islands is that the “ revolt ” of the Shareef of Mecca will have not the slightest effect upon the position of H.I.M. the Sultan Muhammad V. of Turkey as the Khalifa of the whole Sunni Muslim world. As is perhaps known to Sir Edwin Pears, the Sunnis form the greatest majority in the Muslim world, and they attach i no importance whatever to any particular family or clan or to the “ House of the Prophet ” in any religious matter either of the Khalifat or Imamat. Perhaps Syed Ameer Ali P did not consider it worth while to mention in his article, referred to by Sir Edwin Pears, that it would not have mattered at all for the validity of the Khalifat of the first Osmanli Khalifa Sultan Selim, even if “ the adhesion of the representative of the Prophet’s House ” had not been secured by him, and it is wrong (and might have proved mis leading) of Sir Edwin Pears to lay importance on that point. Democracy of Islam does not make any difference between the Prophet’s House and any other Muslim’s House, even if that be of an “Abyssinian slave’s.” The Holy Prophet himself, who repeatedly proclaimed “ I am a man like you,” is responsible for this highly democratic and even socialistic spirit. This is not the first time in Muslim history that a revolt against the established Khalifat has been made. Everybody knows that Hosain, the most beloved and saintly grandson of the Prophet himself, revolted against a wicked Khalifa named Yezid. For want of help and sympathy from the general Muslim public, Hosain, with all the male members of his family, excepting one, was mercilessly butchered by the army of Yezid. Sunnis and Shiahs alike mourn his martyrdom every year in Moharrum, but neither did the Muslims of Hosain’s days, nor do those of to-day, excepting Shiahs, give him any recognition of Khalifat. The Shareef of Mecca, if he has revolted against the Khalifa, doubly deserves the same fate, and perhaps even worse than that of the Irish leaders who revolted against their Sovereign. Islam does not encourage rebellion and revolts. I only hope that British statesmen will not allow them selves to be misled by any such suggestions as Sir Edwin Pears’s. The religious position of the Osmanl-i Khalifat is more secure, even in spite of the war, than that of the Pope. The Entente Powers have so far kept to the wisest attitude of complete and scrupulous aloofness from the affairs of Hedjaz, or from any religious question that may get involved in this world-wide conflagration. I herewith enclose a copy of the resolution passed on May 7th, 1915, by the Central Islamic Society, then called the Islamic Society, on the question of Khalifat. The Society represents not only different Muslim countries but also different Muslim schools—like the Shiah, &amp;c.— erroneously called different sects.—Yours, &amp;c., M. H. Kid wax, of Gadia. P.S.—The difference as to the Khalifat of Hosain given by me above supports the view expressed by the great Muslim jurist, Syed Ameer Ali, that the question of the Khalifat should not be discussed even by non-Sunnis, not to say by non-Muslims.—M. H. K. 158, Fleet Street, London, E.C. July 19th, 1916. To the Editor of THE NATION. Sir, —There is little in the above letter with which T disagree. I agree with the writer that a revolt of the Sherif of Mecca will not have any effect upon the position of Sultan Mahomet as Caliph Of course if he be Caliph dt jure he will remain so whether acknowledged or not. But I have never said there was a revolt against him as Caliph. The writer frankly begins by saying he missed my “ first letter ” on the subject. Had he read it he would not have expressed “ the hope that British statesmen will not allow them selves to be misled by any such suggestions as Sir Edwin Pears’s.” There are no suggestions. Further on he informs us that “ this is not the first time in Moslem history that a revolt against the established Caliphate has.been made.” Of course, there have been other revolts, but who has stated that there is one now? The writer should have read my article before criticizing it. He seems to have doubted his own implied statement; for in the next paragraph he uses the phrase beginning with the words “ The Sherif of Mecca, if he has revolted,” &amp;c. In conclusion, let me inform M. H. Kidwai that in what he calls “ my first letter ” the following words occur, words which I here endorse: — “ Let it be said emphatically that the question (of the Caliphate) is one which must be settled solely byTHE NATION. if -* J I July 29, 1916.] He got out of bed and dressed in a slow, distraught manner. When he had got to his braces be ^ Sinned dressing for a time; he opened the atlas at Northern France, and stood musing over the border. Then he turned to Whitakers Almanack to browse upon the statistics of the great European armies. He was roused from this by the breakfast gong. At breakfast there was no talk of anything- but war Hugh was excited as a cat in thundery weather, and the small boys wanted information about flags. The -''Russian and the Serbian flags were m dispute, and the flao- pao-e of Webster’s Dictionary had to be consulted. Newspapers and letters were both abnormally late, and Mr. Britling, tiring of supplying trivial information to his offspring, smoked cigarettes in the garden. He had an idea of intercepting the postman. His eyes and ears informed him of the approach of Mrs Faber’s auto mobile. It was an old, resolute-looking machine painted red, and driven by a trusted gardener; there was no mistaking it. i Mrs. Faber was in it, and she stopped it outside the o-ate and made signals. Mrs. Britling, attracted by the catastrophic sounds of Mrs. Faber’s vehicle, came out ef the front door, and she and her husband both con verged upon the caller. “ I won’t come in,” cried Mrs. Faber, “ but I thought I’d tell you. I’ve been getting food.” “ Food? ” “ Provisions. There’s going to be a run on pro visions. Look at my flitch of bacon ! ’ ’ “ But ” “ Faber says we have to lay in what we can. This war—it’s going to stop everything. We can’t tell what will happen. I’ve got the children to consider, so herd I am. I was at Hickson’s before nine. ...” The little lady was very flushed and bright-eyed. Her fair hair was disordered, her hat a trifle askew. She had an air of enjoying unwonted excitements. “ AU the ^gold’s being hoarded too,” she said, with a crow of delight in her voice. “ Faber says that probably our cheques won’t be worth that in a few days. He’s rushed off to London to get gold at his clubs—while he can. I had to insist on Hickson taking a cheque. ‘ Never,’ I said, ‘ will I deal with you again—never—^unless you do. . . .’ Even then he looked at me almost as if he J J ... fll thought he wouldn’t. “ It’s Famine ! ” she said, turning to Mr. Britling. “ I’ve laid hands on all I can. I’ve got the children to consider.” “But why is it famine?” asked Mr. Britling. “ Oh ! it is! ” she said. “ But why ? ” “ Faber understands,” she said. “ Of course it’s Famine. . . . “ And would you believe me,” she went on, going back tu Mrs. Britling, “that man Hickson stood behind nis counter—where I’ve dealt with him for years, and refused absolutely to let me have more than a dozen tins of sardines. Refused! Point blank ! “ I was there before nine, and even then Hickson’s shop was crowded— crowded, my dear!” “ What have you got? ” said Mr. Britling, with an inquiring movement towards the automobile. She had got quite a lot. She had two sides of bacon, a case of sugar, bags of rice, eggs, a lot of flour. “What are all these little packets?” said Mr. Britling. Mrs. Faber looked slightly abashed. “ Cere bos salt,” she said. “ One gets carried away a little. I just got hold of it and carried it out to the car. I thought we might have to salt things later.” “ And the jars are pickles? ” said Mr. Britling. “ Yes. But look at all my flour ! That’s what will go first. ...” The lady was a little flurried by Mr. Britling’s too detailed examination -of her haul. “What good is blacking? ’ he asked. She would not hear him. She felt he was trying to spoil her morning. She declared she must get on back to her home. “ Don’t say I didn’t 533 warn you,” she said. “ I’ve got no end of things to do. There’s peas! I want to show cook how to bottle our peas. For this year—it’s lucky, we’ve got no end of peas. I came by here just for the sake of.telling you.” And with that she presently departed—obviously ruffled by Mrs. Britling’s lethargy and Mr. Britling’s scepticism. Mr. Britling watched her go off with a slowly rising ^ indignation. f; f JIt-,. . “And that,” he said, “is how England is going to | war ! Scrambling for food—at the very beginning.” “ I suppose she is anxious for the children,” said Mrs. Britling. “ Blacking! ” “ After all,” said Mrs. Britling, “ if other people are doing that sort of thing ” “ That’s the idea of all panics. We’ve got not to do it, . . . The country hasn’t even declared war yet! Hallo, here we are! Better late than never.” The head of the postman, bearing newspapers and letters, appeared gliding along the top of the hedge as he cycled down the road towards the Dower House corner. § 3 - England was not yet at war, but all the stars were marching to that end. It was as if an event so vast must needs take its time to happen. No doubt was left upon Mr. Britling’s mind, though a whole-page advertisement in th/“ Daily News,” in enormous type and of mysterious origin, implored Great Britain not to play into the hands •of Russia, Russia the Terrible, that bugbear of the sentimental Radicals. The news was wide and sweeping, $nd rather inaccurate. The Germans were said to be /in Belgium and Holland, and they had seized English ships in the Kiel canal. A moratorium had been pro claimed, and the reports of a food panic showed Mrs. Faber to be merely one example of a large class of excitable people. Mr. Britling found the food panic disconcerting. It did not harmonize with his leading motif of the free people of the world rising against the intolerable burthen of militarism. It spoilt his picture. . . . Mrs. Britling shared the paper with Mr. Britling ; they stood by the bed of begonias near the cedar tree and read, and the air was full of the cheerful activities of the lawn-mower that was being drawn by a carefully booted horse across the hockey field. Presently Hugh came flitting out of the house to hear what had happened. “ One can’t work somehow, with all these big things going on,” he apologized. He secured the “ Daily News ” while his father and mother read “ The Times.” The voices of the younger boys came from the shade of the trees; they had brought all their toy soldiers out of doors, and were making entrenched camps in the garden. “ The financial situation is an extraordinary one,” said Mr. Britling, concentrating his attention. . . . “ All sorts of staggering things may happen. In a social and economic system that has grown just anyhow. . . . Never been planned. . . . In a world full of Mrs. Fabers. ...” “ Moratorium ? ” said Hugh over his “ Daily News.” “ In relation of debts and so on ? Modern side you sent me to, Daddy. I live at hand to mouth in etymology. Mors and crematorium—do we burn our bills instead of paying them ? ” “Moratorium,” reflected Mr. Britling; “Mora torium ! What nonsense you talk ! It’s something that delays, of course. Nothing to do with death. Just a temporary stoppage of payments. ... Of course there’s bound to be a tremendous change in values. . . .” § 4 - “ There’s bound to be a tremendous change in values.” On that text Mr. Britling’s mind enlarged very rapidly. It produced a wonderful crop of possibilities before he got back to his study. He sat down to his desk, but he did not immediately take up his work. He had discovered something so revolutionary in his personal affairs that even the war issue remained for a time in suspense.This Document is the Property of His Britanni c Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the F oreran Office ■when done with unless required for official use.i f w ^ mm** »«•* '** ^ ’T (ibi9bi/ie).

The DainiJc Bharat Mitra (Calcutta) of the 24th Jui 4 £^££eE'k.'ca, 4 e^^-^ A,N ^ iT BnARix Who is responsible ful consideration of the 'pros and cons of the sub ject, comes to the conclusion that as the Govern ment of India did not receive from General Nixon the objections made by General Townshend, it should not be blamed for the fall of Kut. Though all the papers have not yet been published, yet from those which have been the only conclusion possible is that General Nixon is responsible for the regret table incident. General Townshend is also to be partially held responsible. In such an important undertaking he should have objected to the orders, though it would have meant some sacrifice of strict military discipline. 61. The Nayak (Calcutta) of the 24th June, referring to the proclama- t . b;a free „ tion of independence by the Grand Sherif of Mecca, recounts how Mecca and Medina passed under Turkish rule in the reign of Mohamet Ali, and observes :— _ The Khalifa of Constantinople was not held in much esteem in India, as long as there was a Padishah at Delhi and India was ruled by Moghuls and Pathans. The name of the Khalifa of Turkey came into prominence in India gradually after the Sepoy Mutiny. The development of the pilgrim traffic to the Hedjaz, made possible by the benevolent measures of the British Govern ment itself, has been accompanied with a development of the Sultan of Turkey’s influence in India, and the growth of the Pan-Islamic spirit has given the finishing touches, so to speak, to the growth of the Sultan’s influence and prestige among Indian Moslems. If the Sherif of Mecca can maintain his independence, the Sultan’s influence will disappear. With the Hedjaz and Irak Arab out of the control of the Turks, half of the Turkish Empire will have disappeared. TV hat will remain of it in Asia Minor will probably be partitioned by Russia and France. The Russians and the British will soon be joinino- hands in Baghdad. Thus it appears that the Turkish Empire will soon be split up; the Moslem world generally will be a gainer rather than a loser thereby. Moslems will progress instead of degenerating if they shape their life in future according to the ideals of the Grand Sherif of Mecca, rather than those of the heterodox New Turks. „ . ^ . 62. The Dainik Basumati (Calcutta) of the 24th June, referring to the u „ Arab revolt against Turkey, writes The Arab,an rev0,t - if t p e Sherif of Mecca proclaims himself Khalif, no Musalman who is not a vassal of Turkey will have any ground for objection, for the Sherif is a Syed and a descendant of Muhammad. I he Musalman community will, however, be thus divided into two parties, one following the Sherif of Mecca, the other the Sultan of Turkey. The Sultan has no real title to the Khalifate. He merely usurps it, because he is the ruler of Arabia. Now that the Sherif of Mecca has thrown off the yoke of lurkey, there will be no bar to his becoming the Khalif. Besides this, the independence of Mecca, Medina and Jedda will make the Red Sea safe for the Allies, -j- . s is most probably the reason why the Hollanders are again sending their merchant vessels to the East via the Suez Canal. . . a The independence of Arabia will have a very salutary political innuence on the Musalmans of India. They will no longer look upon the Sultan o Turkey as their spiritual leader and will be very peaceful under thm r . new spiritual leader, the Sherif of Mecca, whose allegiance to the British Raj will never fail or falter. The same thing may be said of the Musalmans of Afghanistan and Egypt also. 63. The Calcutta Samachar (Calcutta) of the 25th June says that many strange things have been brought about by the Independence of Arabia. present war. One of the latest developments is the sudden declaration of the independence of Arabia by the Sherif of Mecca. This will probably facilitate the performance of pilgrimage by devout Indian Moslems, and as such will, it is to be hoped, be welcome news to them.

Racial distinctions have been made by giving special representa tion to particular communities; so the privilege has not brought any real power to the Indians, who cannot make any law in opposition to Government, whereas Government can make any law in opposition to them. The Indians £ have secured no control over the State finances and commercial policy and they cannot even obtain full information about the doings of Government. Never theless, it must be remembered that it would be madness to expect that the British Government would at once give us full control over the Government of India. We must gain it slowly. For the present we must make good use of what little privilege we have got and try honestly and assiduously to gain more. In conclusion, the writer urges the newly-elected members of the Bengal Legislative Council to discharge their public duties with diligence, disinter estedness and impartiality. 65. The Dainik Basumati (Calcutta) of the 20th June writes We have never had a very high opinion of the 'Mdya’s learning has been ji so _ ca ll e( i boon of the expansion of Legislative LeglsUtive Counci] elections!^ Councils. Indeed, so far the Indian public has gained absolutely nothing by this “ boon,’’ though the Congress has gone into ecstasies over it. We all know how in spite of all that men like the late Mr. Gokhale and Mr. Bhupendra Nath Bose could do the Press Act and the Defence Act were passed. Some time ago Lord Carmichael told the non-official members of his Council not to be very eager to defeat Gov ernment by votes, for such a defeat would not make Government go out like the Government in England. In the Imperial Council, also, the Viceroy told the non-official members that though they might discuss the Budget estimates, it would be impudent for them to wish to have even a peep into the chamber of. mystery where that wonderful concoction, the Budget, is prepared. This then is the privilege which many of our countrymen make so much of. Then, again, the boast of popular representation which Congresswallas like Suren- dra Nath, Ambika Charan, etc., had for a long time been indulging in, has been shattered by the almost total failure of Congressmen to get into the Legislative Council. What then have we gained after all? But we have lost much in morals. From what we learn from our contempo raries of the Barisal Hitaishi, the Hindu Ranjika and the Dacca Herald, the recent Council elections were marked by a good deal of corruption, even wine and women were brought into requisition for securing votes, and life-long ties of friendship were snapped. What a degradation for those who are supposed to be the leaders of the people ! 66. Referring to the defeat of Maulvi Abdul Karim in the election, the “ The elections ” Mohammadi (Calcutta) of the 23rd June writes :— All the districts in the Presidency Division, with the sole exception of Calcutta, voted for Maulvi Abdul Karim; but Calcutta having an enormous number of votes, he was defeated in the end by two votes. His defeat proves that the Musalman voters of Calcutta, who are mostly inhabitants of the Punjab and other provinces trading in the city, have no knowledge of the wnnts and grievances of the Bengal Musalmans and lack sympathy with their hopes and aspirations. The Bengali Musalman voters of Calcutta are generally pensioned scions of Nawab families and titled rich men, who are equally ignorant of and indifferent to the interests of the masses. Thus under present conditions Calcutta will always be a hindrance to the election of a true representative by the Bengali Musalman community in the Presidency Division. We pray to Government to remedy this most undesir able state of things. Objections have been made to the outcries against Mr. Zahed Suhrawardy’s victory. The two votes by which he won are said to have been dubious, for in the voting papers there were marks in black ink against the names of both Maulvi Abdul Karim and Mr. Suhrawardy and the marks against the name of Maulvi Abdul Karim were in red ink. Besides this, the Sub-Registrars of many places, such as the Sub-Registrars of Kandi and Kushtia, who were poll ing officers, used their personal influence against Maulvi Abdul Karim. We have personally seen in the Sealdah Sub-Registry Office voters recording theirM ( 567 ) I.—Politics.’ (a) — Foreign. 1. In the Indian Daily Telegraph (Lucknow) of the 27th June, 1916, The Arab Revolt. the editor comments on the Arab revolt in Hedja'z and the declaration of independence by the Grand Sheriff of Mecca supported by the Arab tribes of western and central Arabia. The editor supposes that the Sheriff is Husain Pasha, who was chosen for the Sherifate by the Young Turks and who was Sheriff when the war broke out. He wonders what has happened in the meanwhile to alienate Husain Pasha’s sympathies with the existing Ottoman regime and lead him to strike a blow for his independence. The editor says that the revolt has already created a great sensation among the Musalmans of Lucknow “ who are naturally very much exercised, along with their co-religionists elsewhere, by any untoward events in the Hed jaz—the seat of their holiest places.” 2. In the Nai The Arab Revolt. INDIAN DAILY TELEGRAPH. 27th June, 1916. Roshni (Allahabad) of the 28th June, 1916, the editor refers to the declaration of independence by the Sheriff of Mecca, and says that though every Indian Muhammadan is grieved to learn the news yet he knows well that it is all due to the folly of Turkey in joining the Germans. He says that the Sheriff of Mecca has no troops or arsenals, fleet or airships, and “ like a limb severed from the main body is sure to become a morsel for some wolf.” He observes that though it is certain that Great Britain will keep her promise and not disregard the sanctity of the places of Muhammadan worship, yet it cannot be expected that she will undertake to prevent other “ wolves from approaching them.” He says that the news has caused great uneasiness among Indian Muham madans. He refers with regret and despair to the deplorable condition of Muslim states and says that the only way out of certain disaster lies in Turkey’s abandon ing the alliance with Germany and coming over to Great Britain. 3. In the Oudh Ahhbar (Lucknow) of the 29th June, 1916, the editor says that the news that the Sheriff of Mecca has declared his independence will naturally create a sensation among Indian Muhammadans. He remarks that he does not mean to say that the independence of the Arabs will cause any very serious harm to “ the purpose of Islam ” or will prove a menace to the Islamic world, but that it will be a matter for particular gratification to the Muslim world if the Arabs develop complete strength and prove fit to manage the affairs of their own country. He says that in the event of their success the Arabs can once again give to the world the benefits they did at the time when their civilization was at its zenith. He observes that the declaration of independence will be welcomed by the Arab tribes because relations between the Turks and the Arabs have always been disagreeable. He says that the promise of the British Government to respect the sanctity of the sacred places of Islam is gratifying to the Muslim world generally and to the Arabs in particular. He however says that it is difficult to say what led Husain Pasha, who was appointed the Sheriff of Mecca at the outbreak of the war by the new Turkish Government, to declare independence. He remarks that perhaps the general bad management of the Ottoman Government and the obviousness of its approaching end may have induced the Pasha to become independent. He suggests that in order to make his future hopeful the Sheriff of Mecca should come under the protection of Great Britain and Russia and with their assistance rid Arabia of the Turks.

A golden opportunity has thus been missed to demonstrate to India that her children are trusted and not suspected, and that they are in truth, as in name, the King’s equal subjects. 5 In the Leader (Allahabad) of the 23rd June, 1916, the editor discusses Imperial Federation after the the question of Imperial Federation after the war. war. The editor quotes extracts from the Melbourne Age and the Sydney Bulletin, which are both opposed to the idea, and remarks that it can safely be said that the people of Australia are not at^ all eager for Imperial Federation and that the views expressed by Mr. Hughes in connection with it are not representative of public opinion there. Great Britain would be the dominant partner, and in her larger interests the Commonwealth might be called upon to make important sacrifices from time to time. The editor says that any Imperial arrangement with the Colonies, out of which India is excluded, would be keenly resented as an insult to her self-respect and as a further degradation of her political status. If therefore the proposal of Imperial Federation is unwelcome to the Self-governing Dominions because it would involve the sacrifice of some measure of autonomy, and as India is whole-heartedly opposed to it because there is no chance of her being represented in it, why should not the matter be dropped, instead of being pushed on, arousing needless controversy and inviting hostile comment? 6. The Advocate (Lucknow) of the 22nd June, 1916, mentions that a public meeting is shortly to be held at Lucknow to censorship m India. protest against “ the ruthless censoring of opinions expressed by loyal citizens of His Imperial Majesty,” and also to protest against the Government of India Bill “ which is full of anomalies and which should not be passed according to Indian public opinion.” 7.

He urges that vigorous efforts should be made for the repeal of the Act. 8. The Garhwali (Dehra Dun) of the 24th June, 1916, says that Govern- _ ' „ A . ment has not acted wisely in demanding security from New India (Madras), as by doing so it has created agitation throughout the country. The editor remarks that it remains to be seen whether Government pays any attention to the representations to be made by the All-India Press Association. 9. Deferring to the working of the Press Act against New India, the . , editor of the Niyar-i-Azam (Moradabad) in the issue of the 26th June, 1916, says that it is highly He says that as Mrs. Besant is a zealous politician and her agitation is sure to prove fruitful, he would like to see the security deposited by New India C'POLITICS AND THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION^ 1. The Muslim Herald publishes the following article under the heading “ The Sherif of Mecca’s indiscretion ” :— It appears from news cabled (to India) that the Sherif of Mecca has revolted against the Sultan’s government, and that he has captured Mecca, Jeddah and Taif, and besieged Medina. This dreadful news has caused a sensation among the Muhammadans. The public does not put absolute faith in all that Reuter cables ever since the war began, and nobody readily believes in the news (supplied by it). All the same, a commotion has been created among the Musalmans whose minds are troubled with various anxieties. Some think that the news (about the revolt) is no more reliable than the insensate talk of a lunatic. Some others who have been to Mecca and Medina think that the tension which undoubtedly existed between the Sherif and the Governor of Mecca, who is a Turk, may have been intensified. Some others are of opinion that the present Sherif who is better, more just, more amiable and more farsighted than his predecessors, could not have committed such a shortsighted action. Yet others opine that because famine conditions are prevalent in Arabia, where even bajrd cannot be had and imports of grain have been stopped, it is a subterfuge for importation of grain. In short, there are as many opinions as there are men. Nobody knows yet what the real state of affairs is* But if there is any truth in the news, then we fear it is fraught with danger for the Sherif. Whatever may be the causes of his rebellious conduct towards the Sultan, he will not be left alive by the Turks for having joined the enemy at such a critical juncture. The possession of Mecca and Medina is the means of keeping up the Sultan’s dignity as Caliph- Supposing the Turks carry war (into Arabia), then the Sherif will assuredly seek the aid of our Government, of the Russians or the French, and an army will have to be sent for assisting him. If an army is sent from here (India), and blood is spilt in Mecca and Medina, it will be a most delicate period for the Moslem world. The Musalmans will find it extremely difficult, nay, impossible to keep their feelings under control. May God forbid! The Times of India in its issue of Tuesday (last) has published a report about a telegram sent by the President of the Anjuman-i-Khuddam-i-Kaaba to His Excellency the Viceroy expressing indignation at the action of the Sherif. The same issue announced that the Moslem League was about to hold a meeting in connexion with this affair, and which was to be followed by a public meeting at Lucknow.^ The affair is fraught with not a little danger for the Turks. Their state is indeed pitiable. Ever since they threw in their lot with the Turks some misfortune or other is befalling them every day. It is unfortunate if one loses the good opinion of others. The loss of spitual supremacy will be disastrous for the Turks. Every one knows that the Turks have never treated the Arabs well. The Arabs have availed themselves of a good opportunity of throwing off the Turkish yoke. One must, however, await developments. The Sherif has made his position critical, and hence (the existence) of the Turks and of all Musalmans is in jeopardy. We will strongly advise the Government to keep aloof from this tarmle. [The Mufid-e-Hozgdr publishes the ^ news ot e revolution and expresses the hope that with the help of the British the y ) ^ lQri will be able to arrange for the next Haj. The Praja Mitra and Pdrsi charac terises as extremely ill-conceived and short-sighted the representation ma e by the Anjuman-i-Khuddam-i-Kaaba of Lucknow to the Viceroy, disapproving the revolt of the Sherif of Mecca and requesting Government to prevent bloodshed taking place at Medina. It reminds the Anjuman of the terrible battle referred to in the Quran during which, it is prophesied, Turkey wi meet with heavy ruin at the hands of a Nasara (Christian), which wou a be marked by the indiscriminate slaughter of old and pious men and even children, during which sacred places would not remain inviolate and which wnuld result in the Caliphate passing into the hands of its original possessors the Koreish Arabs. The paper remarks that a large section of the Moslems believe that the battle alluded to in the Quran relates to the Comments on the Arab revolt.

In view of the attack brought by the Turks upon sacred places like Kerbala and Nejd it is not proper, the paper observes, to find fault with the Sherif of Mecca or the Indian Government. It points out that the Muham madans should consider themselves religiously bound to help, to bring about the destruction of the Nasara that has misled Turkey and at securing the Caliphate for its rightful owners. The ATthbdr-e-Isldm comtemplates with regret the extent of the difficulties into which the recent declaration of inde pendence by the Grand Sherif of Mecca will launch the Turkish Empire. It remarks that orthodox Muhammadans will heartily wish that the Turkish Government may seize this opportunity and make a firm resolve to conclude peace with the British. The paper is of opinion that if, in view of the Sherif’s declaration of independence, the Shiah revolt at Kerbala, etc., and the great loss Turkey has sustained by Kussia capturing almost the whole of her province of Armenia, she throws off the German yoke that step on her part will be productive of great benefit to Islam. It concludes with eulogising the bravery the Turks are displaying in having to fight, in Asia, Russia and England singlehanded. The Mufid-e Bozgdr in its issue of 25th June publishes news about the Arab rising in Arabia without comments.] 2, “ A telegram from Lucknow tells us that the council of the All-India Moslem League at an emergency meeting had Praia Mitra and Pdrsi adopted a resolution placing on record £ its deep (22), 30th June, Eng. cols, abhorrence of the action of the Arab rebels headed by the {Sheriff of Mecca, whose outrageous conduct may place in jeopardy the safety and sanctity of the holy ^ aces Islam in the Hedjaz and Mesopotamia,and condemns them and their sympathisers as the enemies of Islam.’ With all our sympathy and admiration for the Indian Muhammadans for the absolutely correct and loyal attitude which they have maintained throughout amid very difficult and disquieting circumstances, we cannot help observing that the somewhat sweeping and intemperate resolutions of the kind adopted by the Lucknow Council are not calculated to serve any useful purpose If the Grand Sheriff calls Enver Pasha ‘ an ignorant youth who had dragged Turkey and Islam tq destruction,’ who shall gainsay it ? If the Arab rebels appear in the eyes of some people as the enemies of Islam, the Constantinople Turks by their rash doings of the last twenty months have not shown themselves to be exactly the best friends of Islam. As for sympathisers with the Arab rebels, it would be difficult in this country, and in the British Empire at large, not to feel a certain amount of sympathy with a movement which increases the consternation and difficulties of the Turks, who are at present primarily our enemies, and as siding with the odious and relentless Germans, enemies of mankind.” *3. Referring to Mr. Winston Churchill’s speech in the House of Commons urging India to send more men to the t on front, the Mahrdtta observes :—“ If an impartial m ° re observer were to compare India’s share in the Mahrdtta (5), 2nd sacri hces for the war with her share m the opportu- july. ’ nities of self-development in peace time, he would certainly declare that she has done her part bravely and nobly. The Colonies have Rights, which India dues not share. The United Kingdom has Rights, which India does not share. Hence to expect from the latter as heavy sacrifices as may be expected with reason from the United Kingdom and the Colonies would be absurd. Mr. Churchill argued : ‘ when we were engaging every class, when then the last man and the last shilling were to be claimed, we had a right and were bound to claim similar exertions or whatever exertions were possible from the dependencies which shared our fortunes. ’ A right to claim similar exertions ! Mr Churchill forgets that people of the United Kingdom have been enjoying Rights in Peace time which—if responsibility were proportioned to rights, as is equitable justified much more burden being thrown on their shoulders in war time than could be justly thrown on the shoulders of the people of a dependency like India where Dependence to a disgraceful degree has been the order for a long long time.” •f /1 * I ^000** 535 I.~ Politics. s ^ 1.

The Pan jab Samachar (Lahore), of the 24th June 1916, ascribes the impudence of General Carranza towards America to German machinations and says that it has been amply proved that Germany has during the past eighteen months continually worked to bring about war between America and Mexico. In this Germany’s real object is to divert the attention of America in another direction, so that America may not object to the violation of international laws by German submarines and be unable to supply ammunition to the Allies. To bring about war between America and Mexico, Germany has been all along bribing Mexico. 2. The Bajput Gazette (Lahore), of the 24th June 1916, publisher a letter from Karam Chand Bahai, late proprietor of Lord Kitchener s dea . Punjab Advocate, urging Hindus to take a vow on Lord Kitchener’s death. The present European war is in no way inferior in magnitude to the Mahabharat War, when Kaurvas and Pandvas fought against each other. It may be said that now too Kaurvas and Pandvas are at war. Our Government is helping the weak and oppressed and has entered the arena to serve no selfish ends. On the other hand, the Germans have entered the lists like Kaurvas to oppress others and perpetrate injustice. ^ They had been preparing for the war for thirty years and were under the impression that they would soon wipe Pandvas (the British Army) off the face of the earth, but their hopes were not realised. Truth is always victorious and the Germans have failed to occupy even an inch of land belonging to our Government. In all this was discernible the hand of Lord Kitchener’s statesmanship, who has been killed like Arjuna’s son by the cowardly Germans that spread mines in the sea and separated our Commander-in-Chief from us. But we should not be discouraged. On the contrary, we should take a vow like Arjuna that we shall not sleep so long as we do not utterly destroy the Kaurvas. Having referred to the blessings of the British Government and Lord Kitchener’s services to the Empire in general and India in particular, the Gazette concludes with the following exhortation to its readers r—“ If the blood of the Bajputs has not become cold, they should ioin the army, recall Arjuna’s vow and beat the kettledrum of victory by nenetrating the lines of the enemy. If they are killed in action they will find the doors of paradise open, but if they remain alive after killing the enemy royal favours and princely boons will be their reward. It is time lor the Hindus to give proof of their loyalty and bravery « The inevitable has happened. The Arabs, who have always groaned under the op pression and rapacity of the Turks, have thrown off the yoke of the Turkish temporal power. The Grand Sheriff of Mecca, who is in charge of the Holy of Holies of Islam, has, wth che Bti^m^of the Vrab tribes, ien the field. Mecca, Jeddah and Taif have been captured and the Turkish garrisons have surrendered, with the exception of two small foits at the la t named place^ Medina, the resting place of the Prophet, is closely besieged and all com munications with the Hedjaz are in the hands of the Sheriff. This action on the part of the representative of Mecca separates the spiritual interests of the Muhammadan world from the temporal power of Turkey, and puts an end to the difficulties which Turkey has been putting in“he WyTcdfort and convenience of pilgrims to the Hedjaz. For the present however it is rightly urged that the shortage of shipping, apart from the question of supplies and the necessarily unsettled conditions, makes it undesirable that any large number of persons should attempt to proceed on pilgrimage.” (4) The Bulletin (Lahore), of the 28th June 1916, says “ The Arabs, never reconciled to theTnrkish yoke, would have been more than human if they had not ntilised the present opportunity to shake it off The announcement by H,s Highness the Grand Sheriff of Mecca, supported by all the Arab tribes of west and central Arabia of Arab independence of Ottoman rule 1ms not, therefore, su^nsed us.

At the same time, mnsider the dictum of the London Times^ which says that the Arab leaders very shrewd and have now realised that the divine fiat has gone forth for the' destruction of the Turks. This assertion shows which way the whirl blows And this is as it should he, seeing that Turkey is at war with 1 ?no-land and the latter will naturally sympathize with those wno are m a , { war w ith Turkey.

As regards the third point, i.e.&gt; what Indians expect from Government, it may be stated that they only wish Government to allow them to utilise their powers freely and by removing the obstacles placed in their way to enable them to protect themselves and also help Government at times of need. Indian expectations may be summarised as follows :—(a) All colour and racial distinctions may be obliterated ; (&amp;) Indians may be given high ranks in the army ; (c) Indians may be permitted to enlist as volunteers; (d) Queen Victoria’s I'roclamation regarding the Indian Civil Service may be practically renewed; (e) Government may help Indians in economical, industrial and agricultural matters as a kind and sympathetic patron ; (f) liberty of speech and the press may be restored ; (^) the causes of the humiliating treatment meted out to Indians in the British colonies may be removed and the status of Indians raised, the latter being placed on a footing of equality with free citizens; (h) in making arrangements about education and sanitation, the welfare of the subjects may be kept in view and extensive facilities afforded for making education popular and really useful ; and (i) public interests may be particularly kept in view in ex'- tending railways and canals. Indians and the war. 6 . (a) The Urdu Bulletin (Lahore), of the 24th June 1916, says that the Civil and Military Gazette (Lahore) has strongly advised Indians to render substantial pecuniary assistance to England for the successful prosecution of the war. I he Bulletin is surprised at this wilful ignorance of the Anglo-Indian paper. Can it deny that financially Indians are so poor that to saddle them with additional burden is tantamount to involving them in trouble ? The best way of sending pecuniary help from India is to make Anglo-Indians contribute a part of their monthly incomes towards the war fund. They can easily do this out of their liberal salaries. (b) The Kisan (Lahore), of the 28th June 1916, quotes extracts from the history of the war compiled by the Manchester Guardian and the speech delivered by Mr, Chamberlain praising Indians for the services rendered and the sacrifices made by them in connection with the present war. It also quotes the remarks of the correspondent of the London Times, the Statesman (Calcutta), the Pioneer (Allahabad) and the Civil and Military Gazette (Lahore), to the effect that India is not doing all that it can do or ought to do in helping England in bearing the burden of war expenditure in the form of rise in prices and increased taxation. The Kisan observes that it can answer the above criti cism in one sentence. India did what it could and will again do in the future what it can; and though the resources of India are unlimited, still to be able to derive full benefit from them it is essential to reform India. Eor how many hours can the savage population of India, which trembles at the very mention of fire-arms, stand in the battlefield and for how many days can the limited wealth of India suffice, especially when neither industry nor trade exists in India to add to that wealth ? Indian loyalty. t . , ?• The following is taken from a leading article m the Tribune (Lahore), of the 28th June 1916 :— “ The British public were on the outbreak of the war struck by the loyalty and valour of Indian troops fighting against the enemy in France. That was the first o-reat ‘ surprise &gt; that the British people, usually indifferent to and ignorant of India, had'' for this great country. Most of them had very v^ague ideas of India, ideas that were derived from assiduous Anglo-Indians about the ( sepoy mutiny ’ of 1857, the tropical heat, the mosquito, the dark and ignorant ‘masses ' and the frontier tribes carrying depredatory excursions ' Of the real India they knew precious little. Since there was no necessity they did not care to learn either. Naturally they were agreeably surprised when, on the outbreak of the war, they found a loyal and enthusiastic people, who, they once imagined, were only held by the British bayonet. They were pleased that the Indian soldiers fought bravely in defence of f he British Empire. In the exciting period of the war they have no time to consider why the Indians are loyal and why before the war contrary opinions were circulated. They have also no time to consider whether the people here are fully contented and the adminisfration is all that it should be. All these points will be considered after the war. Fo* the present however it is enough to know that there is a change of opinion regarding India, and an awakened interest manifests itself in her future.”'ss ■ v ^ A ; as^’ a 1095 21. The Jandah-i-Rosqar, \ ~\ A great naval battle : Britain’a brilliant victory. , of the 22 nd June, publishes an account of the naval battle off Jutland and the remarks of an American expert and observes:— u As we have already stated we can with confidence repeat that no country in the world is able to stand before the British Empire nor can any surpass it in naval power.” 22. The Quami Report, of the 26th June in a leader, writesThe famous French historian M. Le Bon in his monumental history of u the civilisation of the Arabs” writes:—It may be said that among the world Arabia is the only land, the greater The tumult of the the desert of Arabia. rising m all the civilised countries of part of which has escaped the foreign yoke. This statement still holds good, and no one can reveal to us the hidden constituents of this revolt in the Arabian desert. It was in the fourth century B.G. that the sandy waste of Arabia first came under the observation of Alexander, but he died soon afterwards. Later King Antigon gave his son, Demetris, this problem to solve but the Arabs sent him this message;— u Why do you fight against us? We are the inhabitants of a desert where the things required by people living in towns are not obtainable.” Early in the Christian era King Augustus (of 81 A.D.) invaded Yemen, but without the slightest success. Although with the aid of the histories of the world we are unable to say how many times Arabia has been invaded or what the details of these invasions were. Still we know, according to M. Le Bon, no invasion of Arabia has ever proved successful. There is, of course, the memorable invasion of Mecca by Abraha, the King of Abyssinia, before the advent of the Holy Prophet upon whom be blessings and peace ! and which is referred to in Koran, cv. ! “ Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the masters of the elephant ? ” The original inhabitants of Arabia known as Bedawins are few in number and include common Arabs, Egyptians, Abyssinians, Africans, Berbers, the dwellers of Mesopotamia, etc. To call them Arabs would be as ridiculous as to denominate Parsis and Muhammadans in India, Indians. The Arab’s natural love of liberty, which he imbibes with his mother’s milk, explains why Germans, Romans, and Persians have never been able to conquer him for long and even this is only made possible by inter-tribal dissensions. The historian David says :— u These people have never been vanquished.” According to Herodotus when Persia was in receipt of tribute from Phoenicia and Palestine, Arabia was exempted. But these Arab tribes have not remained stationary. The Arabs, though they still possess this ardent desire for freedom, are much influenced from outside. Amazing changes have taken place in their dwellings, in their coffee-houses and in their ideas, and during the last few years they have become more amenable to authority. The real reason of the success of the Turks over the Arabs is due not to Turkish valour but to Arab weakness The Arabs have lost their national enthusiasm since the Oosmanli Khalifas took possession of their country. The powerful Islamic fraternity reconciled them to the Turks and to their changed condition, they knew that the surrounding powers would not leave them alive. (To be continued.) The Qaumi Report, of the 27th June, writes :—There is no doubt that the Arabs are naturally keen on independence &lt;£ The tumult of the revolt in anc [ f re edom. Besides they have manifested the desert of Arabia.” a genius for government. In the year 1517, however, when the Turks took possession of Egypt, the Khalifate passed into the hands of this new people. The notion of some persons, that it was the Turks who rednced the Arab power, is erroneous. The fact is that, during the heroic period of the Oottomans, the Arabs were dissipating then energies in domestic strife in Spain and Africa. The Turks were undoubtedly precipitate, but their precipitancy benefited the Arabs who, although they had lost Spain, did not cease to rule in the Arabian desert, while the Sharit continued to be selected from their tribes. A Jaridah-I'Koioab, Madras, June 22nd, 1916. Qaumi Report, Madras, June 26th, 1916. (JAV Qaumi Report, Madras, June 27th, 1916. J* i i If 1096 At present our esteemed contemporaries the Madras Mail, the Times and the Statesman (Calcutta) are labouring under a delusion with refer ence to the Sharif of Mecca. They think that this move on his part will prove beneficial to the Arabs and, consequently, the pilgrimage to the Hedjaz will be less restricted. It is a pity they have not been able to understand the Arab affair as we comprehended the Irish problem. As the Sharif was connected with the Holy Land of Mecca and Medina, he was respected and revered by the whole Islamic world. Oiiginally, the Sharif was a mighty power. Tor the better understanding as to whose hands wielded administrative power we should bear in mind the words of Monsieur Le Bon, “ The Arab system of government is simple. The Khalifa is Cod’s representative on the earth. All spiritual, material and military power is vested in him and all the peoples subject to his authority are equal ? We can plainly state here that, up to the end of Abbaside rule, the Arabs developed no clan fanaticism. One reason for this was that the Khalifas were of Arab descent and, for the Arabman in the street this was sufficient. The editor, in throwing further light on Arab history, adds u 1 here is no doubt that the Arabs have prior rights to sovereignty as well as the Khalifate. They are the fountain head of the Mussalmans and the source of Islam. The Prophet (on whom be peace* and blessings) foretold that dissensions among the Arabs would certainly occur. The authentic books of tradition contain revealed ^predictions by the Prophet (may my life be sacrificed for him) regarding Nejd, Syria, Temen and Basra. Andhrapbaxasixa, Madrat, June 2lst, 1910.

The Sampad Alhyudaya, of the 30th June, writes :—The candidates for the Madras School Final examination are The Madras School Pinal suffering great injustice at the hands of the examination, examiners. Even the most diligent students find it difficult to get through the examination. In the Universities in India, 50 to 75 per cent of the candidates are successful. In the Madras School Final examination last year only 25 per cent passed. Seventy-four per cent had appeared for the examination. We are quite unable to discover the reason for this state of things. It is impossible to ascribe it to the students. There cannot be more than 25 per cent who may be said to be well-to-do and therefore indifferent to their studies. In the Calcutta and other Universities 70 to 80 per cent of the candidates come out successful. This is admittedly quite satisfactory. In the Bombay University, 50 per cent are able to get through. There is no room for complaint here too. But the Madras results^56 175 majority of them would prove inefficient soldiers, the Beharee says “ it is true Indian youths do not receive elementary military training and therefore for Indian young men unaccustomed to drilling exercises to he trained in a couple of months for fighting is an improbability, but the fact that i is is so is very lamentable and if our Government had allowed military training to the Indians their excuse of inefficiency would not have been possible. On the other hand, we believe that Indians are not so inefficient as they are supposed to be. They are not cowards and ease-loving, the two great defects in soldiers, and they can be trained to all sorts of disciplines within a comparatively small time.” VI.—MISCELLANEOUS. w i il 18. The Beharee hopes that the news of the independence of Arabia will be a welcome peace of tidings to the The revolt in Arabia. Indian Mussulmans but the suddenness with which this .change has been effected will cause surprise in the minds of the entire Indian people. Arabia with her past history and glorious traditions is once more going to impress its unique and powerful individuality on the Moslem world and to Arabia now the centre of Moslem culture will gravitate. It will of course take time to rebuild the structure ot Arabic ideals ; but the factors for reconstruction are there. 19.

Since the disclosures of General Smuts at Moshi, the Moslem world have been losing faith m Germany s profes sions of sympathy for Islam. The documents found m the archives ot German East Africa bore testimony to the deliberate policy of the Kaiser to undermine the religion of the Prophet in his East African possession. is real attitude of Germany towards the religion professed by her subjects has and creeds in India who enjoy the fullest measure of religious freedom under the British Government. Since the commencement of the war the Germano with their powerful weapons of falsehood and intrigue have been enlisting the sympathy of the Muhammadans all over the world to their cause, and then large promises succeeded in deceiving the young Turks and winning them over to their side. The Muhammadans in India were placed m a very dim- cult position when Turkey threw in her lot with Germany. Their holy peaces of pilgrimage in Arabia were situated within the Ottoman Empire, ana the Turks commenced to maltreat Indian pilgrims who sought to visit Mecca and Medina. Since the declaration of % the war, the officials at Jedda and Mecca appointed by the young Turkish party who could not be friendly to th ® subjects of Britain, have been putting the Indian Muhammadans m Arab &lt; to all sorts of trouble and pillaging their property.. It is no wonder, there fore, that the severance of the yoke of the Ottoman Empire by the Grand Sheriff of Mecca, supported by the Arab tribes of west and central Arabia, has been hailed with the greatest satisfaction by his co-religionists m India. 1 is in the fitness of things that His Highness the Grand Sheriff should always remain the sole custodian of the holy shrines. He is the head of a princely family which traces its descent from the Prophet through Hasan, son o± the fourth Caliph Ali. His hereditary claims coupled with the high respect in which he is held by the Muhammadan world cannot but secure tor him the peruetual right of holding possession of the holy places from w ic ns ancestors were ousted by the Turkish conquest of Mohemet i at t e w m the eighteenth century. The proclamation of independence by the Grand Sheriff is therefore only a reversal to the old order of things.

But the Allies qhould not be slow in giving their aid to the Grand Sheriff so that the enemies’ power and influence in Asia may be effectively crushed on all sides^ With the Russian success in Armenia and the declaration of independence by, Arabia the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire in the East has practically beo-un and the dream of the young Turks to spread and consolidate their dominions in Asia under the protection of Germany is vanished for ever.” H.

Your telegram of the 24th instant. Arab revolt. After very careful consideration we have come to conclusion neither suggestion is really practicable. Ten ofc twelve native officers would in any case have little or no influence or. fail* Indian Moslem opinion and in this particular case they would be discredited as Government servants,in other ra words as the paid mouth-piece of Govt. As regards second suggestion while there is no objection to publication of a carefully worded proclamation fa±xxx + Hf Sherif countersigned by Arab notables,arrival of Arab deputation under official aegis would be not only futile but positively dangerous. The fact is that after its first suprise outburst af resentment of Indian Moslem opinion is now gradually settling down to satisfactory condition of quiescence. This is due partly to sparcity of news partly to muzzling of Pan-Islamic meetings and resolutions and partly to the hint given to Moslem leaders by selected officers regarding Govt, sympathy &lt;iun ohe Araos. for us to indulge now in any propaganda either openly or through the thin veil of Indian officers or iirao deputations would^toi rouse Indian Moslem opinion from the resignation which is now coming over it and to awaken storm of resentment at Govt, interference and pulling in purely religious matters which would inevitably take strong &amp;nti-3herif form. What would be the real influence of public opinion in desired direction is not words but deeds. If Sherif makes good his revolt Indian opinion may be relied upon (unless something very untoward happens) to resigi itself quietly to the fait accompli and meanwhile the most natural and at the •&gt;^ame time most effective agency for turning opinion in Sherif's favour is the pilgrims provided they return without grievances from Haj ; we suggest Sherif should be strongly advised through Cairo in this sense and if necessary ( (W» fW) 4 ,/■ ■■ t &amp;subsidised for express purpose of lightening as far as psssx possible burden of pilgrims at forthcoming Haj.c - ' '&lt;f*P ! Sj^f- From General Lake, Basra, 25th July 191$. (Repeated to Foreign, Simla.) ^ Yours of 19th July. AVe have been studying here the means whereby we can best turn to advantage the Sherif’s action, and we fully recognise the impoitance of doing so. Difficulty is that it is apparent from reports of political officers out-stations that the revolt has not aroused least interest up to now among tribes of Iraq, who, it must be remembered, are almost entirely Shiahs. Even, however, amongst Sunni/ element on the desert side having intercourse with Zo(e)Bir and Khamiisiyeh the news has been received with apathy. And in Basra itself there are shades of opinion; whereas minority are in sympathy with revolt, the majority seem to consider that Sherif has not played fair in revolting at this epoch, and while they would have favoured transfer of Khalifate to a member of the Qureish family^by the will of Islamqthey are inclined to resent efforts of any indiyiduaf to secure it for himself by force of arms. In face of this largely apathetic attitude on the part of Arabs we consider that any propaganda emanating from ourselves would be apt to produce an undesirable impression, but that if we could obtain from the Sherif the text of a proclamation or exhortation which could be printed here above his seal and signature and be^/suitable agents both in Iraq and in desert it would be likely to have effect. To this end we telegraphed to v Cairo on the 14th July asking for text of such a document. As regards Bin Rashid, he has been treated with the utmost patience and leniency, but he is young and boorish and has proved completely intractable, and when, he lately came within twenty miles of Zq^Dir and informed Chief Political Officer that he was there by Turkish instructions, and would join Turks in attacking us if occasion arose, and at the same time intimated that he considered himself entitled to access tp markets of Zof^Bir, we were obliged to break off friendly relations and stimulate friendly tribes to eject him. Sherif’s proclamation when received will give us a fresh opening for getting in touch with Bin Rashid, but the existing state of affairs does not promise well in this direction. As regards Bin Saud, as you are aware, his lieutenants have recently been operating against Sbammaiy near Hail, but Chief Political Officer’s previous advice to him to become reconciled with Bin Rashid will be renewed, care being taken that we do not arouse suspicion in Bin Sand’s mind that we recommend rapprochement because we attach any great importance to avoiding Bin Rashid’s oouoin^ hostility. As regards proposal for Arabic newspaper^ Considerable improvement has lately been made in Arabic addition of “ Basra Times,” and both of sub-editors, and two or three contributors, are members of Arab party. An independent paper would no doubt have certain advantages, but there are a good many objections. It would need very expert and close supervision, and would be difficult to effectiveljv as regards publication of news of the force^ affairs and Cwuh movement; At might very easily tend to force* the pace unduly in direction of the achievement^ of the Arab^ aims. On the whole, we think that disadvantages predominate, but we airead}^ distribute considerable number of copies of “ A1 Umran ” and u Mokajtfittam,’ newspapers of Cairo, and, furthermore, the “Haqiqat’' now reaches us and has been most favourably received. There is a ready sale for it in towns, and the proceeds pay the cost of the agency and distribution. We suggest that separate Arabic literary supplement be issued by editor, “ Haqiqat, and be distributed with it. ..... To summarise. Encouragement to joinedurkish movement will, in opinion, be best given in Irak .by a proclamation from the Sheri 1 ar- V Fir h our himself, the circulation of which we will arrange. A reconciliation between Bin Saud and Bin Rashid will be worked for. 1 he Basra limes had better for the present remain our only local official newspaper in Meso potamia, but an Arabic supplement to “ Haqiqat is strongly recommended. Our present policy of support and goodwill to Arab nation will ire puisued, and will be emphasised, where possible, by judicious evidences of sympathy for Sherif’s aspirations towards freeing Arabia from I urkish suzeiainty and dominance. v ASecret.Arab revolt.

W. Ihe continual revolts of the Arabs in the Yemen, in Mesopotamia, and in Arabia generally, are a matter of common toowledge, and though the Turks have often suffered severely at their hands, the Arabs have never possessed sufficient military resources to enable them to throw off the yoke of a more or less organised Power# Mow, however, a unique opportunity has, occurred to enable the Grand Sherif to completely throw off his allegiance to Constantinople, and I sincerely hope that we have lost no tine in supporting him with every means at our disposal - physical, as well as moral• i /• A mission to the Grand Sherif should start without, delay, but,more Important than all is the in- mediate despatch of Indian Mahommedan Regiments, Machine Guns, and Artillery.

(6). »o doubt a great deal was at once made in India by our authorities when the Grand Sherif announced hie revolt against what is nothing more nor less than Young Turk atheism in regard to the Mahomedan religion.8 Th&amp; Indian Government should take ©very step to explain to the leaders of Mahommedanism the true nature of this rebellion! in so far ae it affects their religion, and as it affects the pilgrimages of their oo-religionists to Mecca, and to the other Holy Places in Arabia, Every true Mahonmedan hopes to journey to Mecca at least once in his life* It is therefore politically iincumbent on the Government of India to make easy, and to foster these pil grimages to the fullest possible extent, because, by so doing we do more than in any other way to cement the loyalty of the Mahoxnmedans in India* If w© were to make a false move now by which the steady flow of this pilgrim traffic was stopped, or even threatened, it would do more than anything to disturb Mahommedan feeling in India, not to put it stronger* (?}• I look upon this revolt of the Grand Sherif as giving us the strongest strategic lever we have yet had against the Turkish Power, and we should use it without delay, and to the fulls at possible extent* If vre can assist the Grand Sherif by proclaiming a 'Jehad' against the Young Turk amongst the Mahomme&amp;ans in Africa and Asia, we shall do more to defeat the Turkish Power than we have yet been able to do in either Gallipoli, Egypt,or Mesopotamia* ffiratlvt - by sending immediately military as si stance in men and munitions, and Secondly ?- in educating Mahommedan opinion to e true nature of this revolt by sending emissaries to every possible Mahommedan District* notably to Afghanistan and the many Arab tribes* The Sherif probably sees clearer than anyone that the whole question of IslaMsm is, to a large extent.4 • shaken to its x'oundations by the fact of Turkey entering this war against Great Britain. (8) . What has already happened is this*- Great Britain deposed* as it were* the Sultan of Turkey on the outbreak of war# and isanediately set up a new Sultan# with Egypt as his country (centre ?). What we may be certain will happen is as follows*- The Allies will win this war* and# as a result Turkish Power will cease to exist both in Europe and Asia* and*with it, the Sultan of Turkey - the KhalifJh. The Siierif recognises this sore than anybody* and that now is his opportunity for asserting himself as true head of I si ami sa* and the true descendant of the Prophet. And can anyone argue that this might not end in being the best arrangement? Geographically it ia sound, as he - the Sherif - actually holds sway in Mecca. That he is also revered as a true descendant of the Prophet# and as a Holy man, goes without saying. (9) .

Wickham, HAKTS. 7th* July, 1916* Major-General*Moon the foregoing proposal a bv L.§ . Uareoliouth, D. Litt.. F.B.A . The general fisdcsa of these proposals 'fill, I think, be clear to students of Islamic history and politics, from the follo'fing considerations: 1. The custody of the Sanctuaries, Mecca and Medina, is a matter of the utmost importance for the Islamic communities. The transference of it from an unfriendly to a friendly po ver must be highly beneficial to the Allies, #10 bet teen them protect a large proportion, perhaps five sixths, of the Mohammedan population of the forld. Common hostility to the Hsrk forms, at any rate for the time, a natural bond of friendship between the Allies and the Sharif. 3. Although the religious headship of Islam has at times been usurped by dynasties unconnected with the Prophet’s family, attachment to that family has always been a powerful motive in the Moslem mind. It seems likely that any loyalty to the Turkish Caliph which may linger in the breasts of the Mohammedan subjects of the Allies would be counteracted by the knowledge that they were fighting for the recovery of supremacy in Arabia and at the Sanctuaries to a descendant of the Prophet, and indeed a descend«ant #iose pedigree is well attested. The relations between Arabs and Hirks which have rarelyrarely been cordial appear to have been more than ever strained since the proclamation of the Ottoman Constitu tion, and the attitude adopted by the Young Turl ish Party. In June IP IB m Arabian Congress ms held in Paris, re presenting an endeavour to consolidate the interests of the Arabic-speaking countries. It seems likely that the secure possession of the Sanctuaries by an Arab potentate raid cause the loyalty of the Moslems of Syria and Meso potamia to gravitate in his direction. 4. The consciousness of the fact that the policy of the pro-Ueraan party in Turkey has led to the permanent loss of the Sanctuaries should lead to the discredit and do j &lt;fn- fall of that party, and more than counteract the effect of the Turkish successes in the Dardanelles and Mesopotamia. For this reason efforts that can be made to secure the Sherif in his occupation are likely to lead to the speedy elimination of the liirk as a combatant. 6. Evidence is no ? before the no rid of the almost avo fed hostility of the German Government to Islms. It seems clear that such a mission as is contemplated by General Pofell raid be of great use to the Sherif in fur nishing him with material for his proclamations, #iich might then be circulated among the Moslem subjects of the Allies and their brethren elsewhere rith the approval of their religious leaders. 6. The record of the Sherif for competence as a ruler andand negotiator would seem (from occasional notices in the Cairene Uohamnedan monthly Manar) to be good. Some account of this should be compiled for the instruction of those who have not followed the internal politics of Arabia in recent times. Oxford, July 13, 1916.R.u.o. July 11th. Dear General Po vell, Jith reference to the comments you have asked me to make upon your Memorandum on **lhe Rebellion of the Great Sherif of Mecca against the Rule of the Young Tiirk*': I quite agree vith you that the Questions of the Caliphate, the backing of the Sherif of Mecca, ini the future of Arabia are questions demanding the most urgent and careful consideration. The unsatisfactory state of affairs in those regions has been disregarded far too long. Ihe immense latent powers of the Arab people, the far reaching spiritual prestige held rightly by the Sherif but usurped by the Ottomans, and especially the 'politico-strategic' importance of the Arabian peninsula, in my opinion, have not received the attention and con sideration they dfimanded as a potent factor in the hr. I agree with you that our policy for the future should be determined now. The present moment is our opportunity. The Sherif should receive all possible support, for he is our 'Trump Card', and should he be successful the blow to Turkey would be incalculable. It is essential that he should succeed, for besides the loss of prestige to Turkey, it would settle automatically the question pf the Protectorship of the Holy Places of Islam. Ihe question of actual military aid depends largely uponupon blether the Sherif can be assisted without the in troduction of Christians. I think m should take the utmost care to avoid anything that might be construed in to a desire to occupy Arabian Territory, or to interfere in the affairs of the Holy province. Hence our difficulty. Christians should not be sent into the Hedjaz under any circumstances. I do not know Aether it would be feasible to send a mission com posed of Indian and Egyptian Mussulman notables? Arabia is a cock-pit of tribal jealousies and family feuds. Ihey are not going to be settled in a day. If ve interfere too much we may have more on our hands than we bargained for. Over a year ago I wrote the following in anticipation of the present crisis:- //hatever the out eerie of the present struggle may be, one thing is certain with regard to Arabia; with Egypt un der permanent British protection and our position on the Persian Gulf and in lower Mesopotamia assured^ it will prove impossible to leave a nest of hornets in between to endanger our interests. An independent Arabia is thinkable, but an Arab stronghold liable to remittent agitation by Turkish counter agitation is inconceivable. Considering the relative positions of and India, and the latent possibilities of a great, new 'Egypt in Meso potamia”, it will be seen that Arabia will some day be called upon to play a part in the development of the Near East, which must inevitably follow on the removal of the Ottomanmm Ottcsra’in blight, it is not unreasonable to think of the creation of an independent Arabian ifeipire, governed by true Mos* 1'^rrio, # 10 se behaviour sight be guaranteed by a pover# such a Great Britain, #10 has interests on her border- lands- f {he power that holds the Ports, Jeddah, Hodeida, Aden, Muscat and Koweit, would speak with dominating accents throu^iout the whole pen sin sul a. By obtaining control of the Ports, by the establish ment of a prestige which w uld be unchallenged, by accum- al a ting an intimate knowledge of the internal affairs of all parts of the province f#iich would serve us #ien deal ing with the various tribal feuds) we might be able to use Arabia to the best advantage- The c^iestion of the Caliphate must be approached with the utmost delicacy. Although the Ihrks are (nominally) Moslems, they are also Asiatic- To anyone who has ex perienced the distinction between East and lest, this is a significant point. The Arabs, even though they were friendly towards us, would be very unwilling to have dealings with Christians with regard to iieir Holy Places. It is complete independence that they want: this has al ways been their character. On any question of religion, or one that touches the Holy Places we may be led into xx very deep water; Great Britain may however be able to deal with the situation through some of her prominent, loyal Moslem subjects. The- 4 - ITie position of the CalipJi in those days rmist be a very dfficult one to fulfil. How can there be any longer 'a aiccevssor to Mahoratnsd ~ a supreme Governor - sirnrene Judge mi supreme comma nde r of all t he Ifoslema'. '«hen Moslems no longer form a carrpact unity under one leadership? One other point. Of the inhabitants of Arabia a very large number are nomadic Bedawin, all of dim are fighting rren. It is my experience that these tribes care nothing for Islam, and have but one desire - n**mely - to be free » from all restraint and to be left alone to do as they like. It is this element that the Sherif may have difficulty in dealing with. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) Douglas Carruthers. P.S. I might add that all existing knowledge on Arabia is being collected and tabulated under the direction of the Ainiralty *?ar Staff. An Arab Bureau has been established ii Cairo, and we are pushing ahead an up-to-date map, which will cover the whole of the peninsula, and contain the litest information.(W. 137255/16) Immediate. Sir:- In reply to your letter P. 2759 of the 14th in stant, relative to the inclusion in the proclamation issued by the Grand Sherif of a reference to the bombardment of the Holy Places by the Turks, I arn di rected by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you, herewith, to be laid before Mr. Secretary Cham berlain, a copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt, stating that he has twice ad vised the Sherif to expunge this reference from his proclamation. Sir E. Grey presumes that the Grand Sherif has not acted on Sir K. McMahon’s advice, and the procla mation, together with the reference to the Holy Places, appears already to have been published in Morocco, Al geria and the Soudan, in all of which places it has been well received. In these circumstances Sir E. Grey doubts whether it would be desirable to curtail the discretion of the Sherif in this matter, and I am to suggest that, if the Government of India see grave objection to the pro clamation, they should instruct the Censor to prevent its entry into India.

We should prefer not to make any announcement in India at present because any official announcement would be liable to distortion and misconstruction, and give food for fresh pan-Islamic agitation. We have Indian situation well in hand, and think it best for Moslem community to get accustomed to fait accompli in Hedjaz rather than be hustled into a definite attitude. Moreover, in Afghanistan announcement of our sympathy for Sherif, which would be construed as instigation and co-operation, would certainly embarrass Amir, who, until we declare ourselves, can answer pro-Turkish party that he has no ground for quarrelling with us over this matter. Reports from Kabul indicate that Amir has called secret council to discuss matter, and that there is excitement. This would only be increased by proposed announcement here. We consider proposed announcement in itself unobjectionable, and see no reason why it should not be published in other Mohammedan possessions, and, later, filter through to India by post.

(Repeated h oreign, Simla ; Chief of General Staff, Simla; and Cairo.) LG. 3-28, dated 9th July 1916. Your telegram of 30th June firstly. Suggested reconciliation between Bin Saud and Bin Rashid At meeting with Bin Saud ,n January, Chief Political Officer explained to hhn that it would be helpful to British policy if he became reconciled with -Bin Kashid and won him over to our side. rr Bm m f de . over hires as he was expected probably to do Bin Rashid (. Saud) then intended encouragement of them. Things shaped otherwise however. Shortly after Bin Sand’s return to Riyadh he was cahed MyT n t0 PUmSh A1 M ° n ' a WhUe Bin Rastid -owed up towards Latter’s intentions and attitude were from the first doubtful but he showed no inclination to be unfriendly and so was treated with utmost patience and allowed obtain necessaries from our towns until he final lv stated to Chief Political Officer’s emissary that he was here by intuS and m payment of links and would certainly join them in attacking us if the lurks sent troops to support him. On receipt of this frank declaration, the Russlam section of the Shammar and the Dhafir, who are in our pay, were encouraged to oppose him and clear him out. They came in contact with him on 28th June near Khamsieh, and, supported by a squadron of our cavalry, routed him and captured some 4-00 of his camels and killed 15 or 20 men. Meanwhile, reports have been received that Bin Sand’s son and brother are operating against the Shammar near Hail with considerable success, and on the other hand, that Bin Rashid has received a telegram from Constantinople calling upon him to return to Hail and await Turkish support. It is expected that this summons, combined with the knock recently administered to him, will send him back to Hail, but at present moment he is within few miles of Khamsieh. It is possible, however, that the active hostility of ? Shammar and Dhafir, and difficulty he now finds in feeding himself may induce him to make overtures to us, but this is hardly likely. He has only small following and very little prestige, and unless he is joined by other tribes, is of little military significance. ly _ Secondly.-—Effect of Sheriffs action. Minds4©£ movemerrt slow/here, and it is early yet to gauge its full effect. The news created no particular stir, and large majority of the inhabitants are too ill-informed to appreciate its significance, and many are disinclined to credit it. The actively pro-Turkish element, of which a number of former Turkish employees form the nucleus, regret it and consider that it is unfair of Sherif to rebel and raise question of Arab independence while Turkey was in throes of war. Intelligent Shiah Arabs, with little more liking for British than for the Turks, appear to be pleased at news, and affect to hope that Sherif’s declaration will be extended to Iraq. The small sprinkling of enlightened Sunni Arabs, including a few individuals of Arab nationalist tendencies now here, are of course delighted, and among these the chief Arab resident of Basra, after the Naikib, on being acquainted with Reuter’s communique by Chief Political Officer, at once remarked spontaneously, “ What the Sherif ought to do now is to declare himself Calif, everyone would welcome it.” The recent incidents at Kerbela will of course create greater stir in Persia than in Iraq. Here the majority of Shiah, who as a class are strongly anti-Persian, discount the significance of the occurrences and regard them as phase of the time-honoured feud between Holy Places and the Turkish Government. The minority regard Kerbela incidents with indignation, and make them a specific reason for welcoming Sherif’s action and hoping for its extension to Iraq.

I was very glad to see that the authorities did adopt the same course as was suggested by me, with the result that although a Holy TV ar was declared by Turkish Ministers it did not arouse Moslem fanaticism, because the Holy Places and religious questions as to the Khalifat, &amp;c., were wisely left absolutely and assuredly alone by Great Britain and its Allies, ^ Now sensational news has been spread broadcast concerning those very Holy Places. The Times' leading article announcing the news was well written in so much that it reproduced the declaration made by Great Britain and its Allies as to its inviolability of the Holy Places and their Port Jeddah, and that it plainly said that the incident was domestic and only temporal concerning none but the Moslems themselves. But the next day news from Constantinople was published to the effect that a British man-of-war had bombarded the Hedjaz coast, and this news was never contradicted. With your experience of India you know that for some time—a good long time m fact—Indian Moslems have felt suspicious of the policy of Great Britain towmrds the Holy Places. They have been led to believe that it w r as the object of Great Britain to have Arabia and the Holy Places of Islam under its Protectorate or under its influence. As you know one of the commands in the Holy Quran itself forbids the ruling of all non-Moslems m Kaaba, and it is essential that the Khalifa should be an independent Moslem ruler.

Long (formerly Editor of the Indian Daily Telegraph), dated 7th July 1916. Moslem residing in this country, whom 1 have known for a great many years. He is, needless to say, an ardent politician, and one who, while he professes to be very loyal to the rule of this country in India, is undoubtedly to be pro-German, but this he will not admit. As the letter contains a very fair exposition of the views of the young Indian Moslem pro-Young Turk party, I thought it would be interesting to you, and that possibly you might pass it on to the under.Secretary of State. You know I have always endeavoured to bring to the notice of the authorities any policy or steps on their part which may be likely to cause misunderstanding and unrest in the minds of Moslems. My best efforts were also directed to a rapprochement between the Moslem domains and Great Britain. . Before this unfortunate war between Turkey and Great Britain was declared I approached, through an M.B. friend, responsible people in the Government advising them to issue a declaration, m case the wai between Turkey and England did break out, that Great Britain would do nothing, even under provocation from the Turks, to create any change m the Native guard at the Holy Places of Islam. I impressed my friend that it would be to the interest of the Turks to compel Great Britain to show some sort of design towards the Holy Places, either of a Protectorate or of a conquest, iust to arouse the invincible fanaticism of the Moslem world. I send you herewith a copy of a letter I have received from an Indian pro-Young Turk. I have pointed out to him that to be pro-Young Turk is Extract Letter from an Indian Moslem. ruler. S 315 30—7/19162 Since this war broke out Mussulmans have been watching with anxious interest the attitude of Great Britain towards these Holy Places, and because so far British Statesmen were very wise indeed to give no occasion whatso ever for Mussulman to feel suspicious everything has inn smoothly m that respect. The servants of Ivaaba Society, which is solemnly pledged to see that the Holy Places do not get into the control or protectorate of any non-Moslem power, has expressed its thanks foi the declaiation made by Great Britain for itself and its Allies. The Mussulmans have expressed their gratitude for the wise step taken of announcing that pilgi image to Hedjaz shall not be hindered and stopped by Great Britain. When this policy of leaving the Holy Places alone has pioved so successful, I do not think the British statesmen will feel inclined to alter it. But then the news from Constantinople that British men-of-war had bombarded and approached Hedjaz coast ought to ha\e been at once contradicted. By the comments of English papers on the subject of this “ Revolt of the Arabs ” I gather that even the educated people here have failed to realise the true aspect of the incident, and I do not blame them for it. It requires intimate knowledge of the sentiments and feelings as well as of the religious metaphysical currents in the minds of Moslems to understand such important problems concerning their religion. You are in a far better position to understand them as you have been for su^h a long time in touch with Moslems. Now Moslems having been commanded by the Holy Quran not to revolt against the established authority of their co-religionists cannot look down but with contempt on any efforts on the part of the Arabs to revolt against the Turks. The Moslem masses, uneducated as they are and favourably attached to Islam as they are themselves they will never believe that the Arabs have arisen against the Khalifa of their own accord. And if they have risen they deserve every punishment as did those Moslems, even in early Moslem Arabian Turkey who rose against their Khalifa. The general Moslem public will never have any sympathy with the revolt. As far as the educated Moslems are concerned they know the Arabs, their character and their want of military organisation too well to take the rebellion to be serious unless some non-Moslem power is inclined to abuse the fanaticism of the whole Moslem world by helping the Arabs and using them as its own tool for its own purpose of creating a division among Moslems or breaking their temporal power. I do not think any sane non-Moslem Government would consider it even worth while to do so on the present occasion. The Mussulmans themselves would much sooner see the whole edifice of the Holy Kaaba to be razed to the ground than its being protected by any non-Moslem. As far as a non-Moslem prince with any sinister ambitions against the Holy Places is concerned she (England) can see if she is not blinded completely, that she can hurt neither the military, nor the eccle siastical power and influence of Turkey and the Khalifa by helping the Arab revolt in Mecca. In this war Turkey has not gained much from that portion of the Hedjaz being under her control. Obviously they have not got many recruits from either Mecca or Jeddah because Great Britain and its Allies were wise enough to announce that they would not interfere with the HoR Places and Jeddah and with any religious affairs of Moslems, and the Turks could not gain any advantage from their Sovereign being the Khalifa of the Moslem world. Now, if the revolt of the Arabs is really serious the Turks will gain a great moral advantage and also, perhaps, military advantage. Beside the fact that the whole Moslem world wall get into a condition of great excite ment, and will, as a mattei of course, begin to feel suspicious of non-Moslem designs against the temporal and spiritual domains of Islam, the Moslems within the Ottoman Empire will then take this war to be a really religious Holy War, threatening the control of the Holy Places. It is absurd to think that once the question of the Holy Places of Islam is involved the war will continue to lemain onb temporal. Mecca and Jeddah are isolated places nrnl AVPn if they were allowed by Turkish military experts to drift from bythen hands for the time being, that would not hurt the military situation. The Turks would, on the contrary, get great unreal support because every lurk will be forced to believe that not only his temporal domains, but also the spiiitual domains of his Sovereign depend upon how he fought in this war. Even the Arabs themselves who do not belong to the clan of Mecca Arabs would feel it their religious duty to keep the Holy Places in a position which would keep them free from non-Moslem interference. In short, every statesman who can fully appreciate the psychology of the situation will see that the revolt, instead of weakening the power of the Turks, will solidify it both materially and morally. The only wise course for Great Britain and its Allies will be to persist in its wisely declared policy of leaving the Holy Places of Islam and religious questions alone—strictly and vigorously, in spite of temptations and even provocations. To take any part in the troubles in Hedjaz, nay, even to show sympathy with the rebellious people in Mecca or Jeddah, will be playing into the hands of Germans. If you can, warn British statesmen against it.fW'S'V, l2l!CfvUvCl{Ay\C:4r!£, ■ \ LOlvilGHv Vi\u /____J7th July, 1916. \. f &gt;r 7 ~ / “ » J W/fZ 0 fhsti/jsv /V r-:-% •, — 7 r~C fifrrtoJL ?''' { 'C ^ Dear Sir Arthur Hirtzel, 1 send you herewith a copy of a letter I have received from an Indian Moslem residing in this country* whom I have known for a great many years.

While anxious to co-operate fully and loyally in policy of His Majesty’s Government, I respectfully submit that in view of attitude of Indian Moslems and probable attitude of Afghanistan, whole question requires very careful review before we drift into action which may permanently estrange 70,000,000 Indian subjects, thereby sowing the seed's of serious trouble hereafter in India which may, moreover, render Amir’s position gravely embarassing. It appears probable that Sherif’s revolt will sooner or later be crushed by Turks unless we send large military forces to support him, either to Syria or to Hedjaz. Whether a Syrian expedition is possible or not, we are not in a position to know, but as regards Hedjaz we are convinced that landing of foreign troops, even without British officers, will cause, when known, serious agitation in the Moslem world. Complete and widespread success could alone justify such a measure and palliate its results. To send small foreign force to Hedjaz which runs the risk of being eventually crushed, would bring on us odium without advantages. In default of fuller knowledge we are driven to the conclusion that from the Indian point of view the best policy will be to continue doles of money, munitions, and supplies to Sherif, but to refuse further actual military assistance unless the Syrian expedition is possible and above all to keep ourselves in the background.n X w;: w (W. 129462/16) V \- V Secret and Imraediate. a i I i Sir :- Ppreign Office, July 7th, 1916. Co?ry to x b JUL1916 I am directed hy the Secretary of state for Fo reign Affairs to acknpwledge the receipt of your let ter P. 2527 of the 4th instant, relative to the ques tion of publication of news connected with the Arab rising under the Grand Sherif of Mecca. I am to state in reply that, if the Government of India consider that the publication of the fact that Turkish troops have shelled the Ka’aba will have a bad effect in India, he is prepared to withhold such publication for the present, and instructions in that sense have been sent to His Majesty’s High Commission er in Egypt. As regards the protest of the Government of In dia against the circular telegram issued by His Ma jesty’s Minister at Tehran on the 2nd instant, I am to explain that Sir C. Marling was instructed on June 23th last, in a telegram of which a copy is enclosed herein, to issue a dementi of the action attributed to British ships of war by a Turkish communique of June 27th, if that report had reached Persia. I am to observe that, while Sir E. Grey entirely agrees as to the desirability of concealing the connection of His Majesty’s Government with the Arab rising as long as possible, he considers it of the highest importance to prevent false and mischievous statements made by the The Under Secretary of State for India. , r. S 1 O ^ 1 t— J A\jL » - *' s .the Turkish Government from passing unchallenged, since to do so only increases the belief that His Majesty's Government are the real instigators of the Arab revolt and tends to create the very atmosphere of Moslem dis trust and resentment of which the Government of India are so apprehensive. It is not possible to conceal, for any length of time, at least in Moslem countries, facts such as the shelling of the Ha'aba by Turkish troops, nor is it possible to prevent the publication in neutral coun tries of Turkish communiques, which inevitably filter through, probably in an exaggerated form, to the Mo hammedan subject races of the Allies. The proper po licy would seem to be to state the facts in their right light and to counter false Turkish statements before they have got a firm hold of ignorant popular opinion. Sir E. Grey would be prepared to instruct His Ma jesty's Minister at Tehran to consult the Government of India before publishing anything connected with the Arab revolt, so long as the above considerations are borne in mind, but he feels strongly that in all Arab countries, such as Mesopotamia, it is essential to pre vent the Arabs being misled by the Turks and to show the former that the Sherif is fighting the battle of all Arabs. Tftis cannot be done by concealing facts which are common property, nor by giving a free run to Turkish mis-statements. Sir E. Grey assumes that the Government of India would3 f \ would not object to a plain statement of the fact that British ships have not fired upon Moslem Holy Places, and he hopes they will propose their own formula for contradicting falsehoods of this kind. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government, and should he retqrned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official use. ] —«——»IIHI mil II .1 gni .1 i . ..i.. ■CTII1I.L r afc'&gt;*“ I'*’.' ip v Js„ ie Siies on ly Cypher telegram to lL.hU ■ Hepresenta 'oives at:- Tangier Batavia Cairo Algiers Tripoli T ehera n Loanda* ^ No 0 32.

Meeting of Arjuman Hamdard-I-Islam at Madras reported to have passed resolution condemning Sherif. heeling at Lucknow and Cawnpore con tinues strongly anti-Arab and shows sign of spreading over United Provinces and to Bengal. This feeling is not due in any way to Turco-German propo- ganda as surmised by Sirdar (vide Cairo telegram 542) as such propaganda have been rigorously excluded by censorship and had practically no effect. Fact is, educated Indian Moslems are at bottom pro-Turk while all classes resent bitterly any idea of desecration of Holy Places whether by Turk, Arab, or Christian, and condemn Sherif for jeopardising them. There is no sympathy for Arab, about whom Indian Moslems are indifferent, and no propaganda of which Arab movement is main feature could have beneficial effect. We do not anticipate at present any form of violent demonstration in India. If, however, naval action at Jedda becomes known and troops under British Officers were landed in Hedjaz, which we strongly deprecate, strain might be too great . Next to desecration of Holy Places, Indian Moslems dread idea of non-Moslem suzerainty over Hedjaz. It would relieve situation if we were authorised to say that Great Britain has no intention whatever of establishing protectorate or exercising suzerainty over Hedjaz or of allowing any other non-Moslem power to do this. Our chief apprehension, however, is not regarding India itself but lest Indian Moslem opinion reacting upon Kabul should make Amir’s present attitude of neutrality impossible. We are taking immediate steps to warn firebrands in United Provinces against further foolish utterances or resolutions. vIn any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No W. and addreas- /1916 The Under-Secretary of .State Foreign Office, London. v - i?

Railway was to operate as far as Medisalih where their advanced i'osts will be. Owing to youth and inexperience of Zaid it was impossible to obtain very detailed information but appreciation of the situation formed by Btorrs and Hogarth is that revolt is genuine and inevitable but about^uhdertaken wita inadequate preparation^ in ignorance of modern warfare. Both in organisation and armament of forces too much has been left to the last moment and to luck. Buccess will depend on their overwhelming numbers. It is evident that we should assist them by all means possible at our disposal. Success also will raise problems demanding our assistance.

J must protest against Minister at Teheran’s circular telegram of 2nd July, which has been repeated to me en clair by Cox. _ 1 his circular gives widespread publicity to Turkish communique announcing that British have fired on Holy Places on Red Sea Coast; and the dementi he authorises is open to serious misconstruction. It is all important to suppress news of our Naval action at Jeddah as long as possibie. It is most undesirable that news should be spread by our own omcers in the and on the attention-of-Govornmcnk Cox has ordered C-ulf Officers to suspend action, and I have done the same as regards Seistan and Meshed.From Viceroy, 30th June 1916.

Arab revolt, outside India has been stopped. Resolutions of this kind were to be expected from All India Moslem League and Khuddam~I**Kaaba which contain pro-Turk pan-Islamic elements. Extreme boldness of the Resolution is somewhat surprising. It has already had unsettling effect evidenced by Moslem meetings at Lucknow and Calcutta which hatoe confirmed it. Bombay will doubtless follow Lucknow’s lead. We are confronted with great difficulty in dealing with this movement. To suppress, all news of such Resolutions and meetings in India without making any announcement of our policy is both impolitic and impossible. We can censor telegrams but we cannot control news by letter. We do not consider an announcement of our policy desirable until it is more certain that Arab revolt will be successful. To identify ourselves with an C* n $. unpopular movement awaken^ bitterest religious emotions would if movement ar-ises merely excite odium and lower our prestige possibly worse. For the time being we think there is no alternative but to maintain silence and allow Resolutions to be passed and meetings held so long as these are not of a definitely inflammatory character* If when AraJ§ revolt promises to be successful excluding Turks from Redjaz, we shall be in a paxitimcix position to xisxix consider measures for guiding Mahammedan opinion on right basis. But our real anxiety is with regard to Afghanistan ami Korth-West Frontier especially if thet adopt view aduiabrated in Bombay that Sherriff's action by endangering Holy Places has given real cause for Jehad. Addressed to S. of S. for I., repeated to Cairo as No. 346 S.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 30th June 1916. Foreign Secret. Your telegram dated 29th June. Arab revolt. Surprise with which Shenf s rising appears to have been received m India suggests that ground has not been prepared for a result highly probable from the known policy of His Majesty s Grovernment, and from the information supplied to you fiom time to time as received here. Moslem opinion will now piesumably take some time to crystallize. I3ut situation must be grasped iirmly and wdiile His Majesty’s Government agree that you should avoid public utterances as long as possible, we think that interval should be used to get in touch with Moslem leaders, anjumans, and organisations accessible to your influence and especially with Chiefs like Yizam and Begum of Bhopal. Line of argument to be used seems to be this. Moslems should be asked to recognise once for all, like all other classes of His Majesty’s subjects, that to be pro-Turk is to be anti-British since allies of our enemies must be our enemies, and the enemies of our enemies our friends. The Turks by their own action brought themselves into former category and we cannot in any way distinguish between them and the Germans. Arabs on other hand have long been attempting to throw off oppressive Turkish yoke which Indian pilgrims have themselves experienced, and Arab movement is no new thing. By opening hostilities now Arabs have, ipso facto, become the enemies of our enemies, and His Majesty’s Govern ment are pursuing the only possible course if they sympathise with the movement and do not refuse support when asked for. But of course we shall remember, above all things, our pledge, and the Holy Places will be more immune than ever from risk of attack or molestation by Christian naval and military forces when the removal of Turkish authority has made interference with pilgrims no longer likely. There could be no justification for any charge of breach of faith. Nor will our attitude of absolute religious neutrality be in any way infringed. Whether an Ottoman Turk or an Arab of the true race is Khalifa is a matter solely for the decision of Moslems (outside India as well as in it), and His Majesty’s Government disclaim all desire to interfere in it. You will not have failed to notice contrast between our respect for Holy Places and action of Turks, who have attacked Holy Places of both Shiahs and Sunnis. (See telegrams relating to events at Kerbela and Mecca.) As regards bombardment of Turkish position outside Jeddah, see McMahon’s telegram No. 492 of 21st June. McMahon’s telegram of 28th June gives latest news, and he is again being instructed to keep you fully and frequently informed. As regards support of Grand Sheref you have seen copies of all correspondence with him and know how far we are committed. We have made no public statement, but our policy is to aid him quietly with munitions, food and money, and so to employ our forces in Middle East as to divert Turks as much as possible from him. Two Egyptian batteries manned solely by Egyptians without British officers have been sent to Jeddah. You will be kept informed of all further action contemplated, but at present we are aware of none. If any communication to Amir should become necessary, please consult us, but so far as we are concerned his position is in no way affected,'ho/^U t/fS\/ DRAFT TELEGRA TO VICEROY. i’OTBif'n imereti, 'four ^traa 29th June.

Secret Arab revolt It is too early to gauge full effect of announce ment, but there is no doubt that profound sensation has been caused among Mohammedans Arab revolt under Sherif had not been foreseen and came as bombshell. _ Many doubt correctness of communique, while others suspect . ri l ls h participation in revolt. Opinions are still fluctuating, but following is brief appreciation of situation:—In internal India the most prominent pan-Islamic institutions, Khudan-i-Kaaba, and largely composed of Committee of All India Moslem League, have announced through their officials wholesale condemnation of Sherif and his sympathisers. This was not altogether unexpected as since war there has been strong pro-Turkish element in both bodies, but it will possibly give (? unfortunate) lead to considerable body of Mohammedan opinion. If facts transpire which may seem to justify charge of breach of faixh against British Government, and if Sherif cannot maintain his position, there may ensue period of excitement and demonstrations during which bitterness hitherto partially concealed may find open vent. Even loyal and reasonable Mohammedans hesitate to applaud Sherif, but say that it is too early to judge. As regards North-West Frontier, Roos-Keppel reports that effect has been bad in the extreme, and the Sherif’s action is universally condemned. He has been publicly cursed at services in mosques, and our connivance and assistance are assumed by all. As regards Afghanistan we have no definite information yet, but we view situation with anxiety. This new development may render Amir’s position more difficult and will be used by War Party to make capital out of danger to Holy Places It is possible that Amir himself may personally resent ISherif’s action, and I feel it right to bring this to your notice. This development is all the more deplorable in that both in internal India and on our frontier we had secured a condition of extraordinary quiet, and the prospects of peace were very favourable. We have had no news of events in Hedjaz for over a week, and would be glad to be informed of progress of events. We should also be glad of a clearer idea of future policy in that direction. The bombardment of Turkish positions at Jeddah was an unpleasant surprise to us, and we should be glad to know what, if any, further military or naval action is contemplated. Our ignorance of this makes it difficult for us to deal with questions that must undoubtedly arise. We have been considering desirability of issuing communique to allay Mohammedan excitement and to define as far as possible the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in this matter, but matter is fraught with obvious difficulty, and we are very doubtful of committing ourselves. At the same time it will be difficult for us, in view of our undoubted instigation of Sherif which is already subject of bazaar rumour, to maintain prolonged silence.^ But for present we shall do nothing beyond encouraging Haj. We do, of course, loyally accept His Majesty’s Government’s policy, and shall endeavour to carry it out in spirit as well as in letter.11 - From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 'cVth June 1916.
