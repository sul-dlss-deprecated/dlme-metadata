The numbers are written in pencil, are enclosed in a circle, and appear in the top right hand corner of the recto page of each folio. Most of the maps and diagrams (ff 1, 3-5, 7-8, 10-18, 21-22, 24-25) need to be unfolded to be examined. This is the sequence that has been used to determine the order of pages. There is also an original printed reference number that appears in a similar position to the main foliation sequence. This relates to the list of maps and sketches in Part I, numbered 1-26. According to this list, one item is not present with the volume: '26. Explanation of the method of giving map co-ordinates adopted in Chapters XIII and XX'.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume
