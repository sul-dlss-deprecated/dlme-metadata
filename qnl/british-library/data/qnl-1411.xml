Political Department. From, COLONEL R. PHAYRE, c. b ., Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. To, THE COMMISSIONER IN SINP, KUERACHEE. Jacobabad, 30th July 1870. S ir, With my memo : No. 1115, dated 25th instant, I had the honor to despatch 1. Political Superintendent's letter 1100, dated 20th July 1870, to Captain C0 P^ 0S Sandeman. ■&gt; correspondence as per 2. Captain Harrison's letter No. 36, dated 7th July 1870. margin. , _ . 2. I have now 3. Vernacular letter from His Highness the Khan to the Commissioner in Sind. the honor to forward 4. A series of intercepted letWs. the further commun i. cations just received from Khelat. 3. In submitting the papers now forwarded, I an sorry to be obliged to solicit atten tion to the gratuitous slight, if not insult, that the Khan of Khelat has offered me as Political Superintendent on this Frontier, by ignoring me in a matter of exclusively Frontier business, and addressing you direct regarding it, without even vouchsafing the courteous covering letter, which is usual, when the Khan addresses the Commissioner direct through the Political Superintendent on matters of etiquette, or in reply to a letter. 4. Captain Harrison's letter to my address is just as marked. He encloses it in an envelope, addressed by himself to you, enclosed in a second one to my address, thus ignoring me as completely as if I were not holding the office entrusted to me by Govern ment. 5. I invite particular attention to all this, as indicating an unhealthy tone at Khelat ; which is the more serious, because I have never had the slightest personal difference with the Khan, and were he within reach of my personal influence, I can confidently say that all that is now under report, and a good deal that has occurred since last year, would not have taken place. I am daily engaged in transactions that promote Khelat interests, and the welfare of Khelat subjects, on a far larger scale than falls to the lot of any other British Officer on the border, and therefore I do not think that the Khan would per se have ventured to do what I complain of; but even if he would, he had Captain Harrison at hand, to instruct him differently. I therefore naturally hold him, as my subordinate officer, responsible for the awkward dilemma, in which he has placed the Khan and myself.G. I fully anticipated some contretemps of this kind when I read Captain Harrison's 7. Turning now to the matters under report, you will have already learnt from my letter No. 1100, to Captain Sandeman's address, that I in no way defend his interference on the present occasion, in having written to the Sirdars and their friends at Seebee, and Kandahar; on the contrary, I consider it was imprudent and quite unnecessary for the reasons given ; but, notwithstanding this, I cannot as the principal Political officer on the Frontier, allow the serious imputations and inaccuracies contained in the Khan's letter to vour address, to pass unnoticed, because, an undue effort seems to have been put forth, to make much more of this affair, than there is really any necessity for; most of what the Sirdars have now written, being in print with the correspondence of 18G9, 8. I believe I am right in asserting that, up to the time of Captain Harrison's arrival at Khelat, no Khan has ventured to speak of an English officer, and of a policy, which His Highness perfectly well knows, has received the sanction of Government, in the follow ing strain ;— ' How therefore could officers, without the permission of their Government, enter into ' correspondence with my rebel Chiefs, in such a manner as would probably lead to another ' rebellion in my country.' 9. This para : refers only to the correspondence with the Sirdars, but the word ' Officers' is used, whereas Captain Sandeman's name only appears in the correspondence. Captain Harrison should explain this. The next para : attacks the policy. ' 10. How then has Captain Sandeman entered into communication with these tur- ' bulent Chiefs, and promised them aid without consulting me. I would also bring to your « notice that whilst Captain Sandeman was in the Murree hills making arrangements with ' that tribe, they descended into the plains of Cutchee, and on the 3rd (instant) plundered '• the Village of Poolajee, killed fifteen men, and carried off their flocks. ' As you have always been a friend to me, I hope you will represent what has oc- ' curred to your Government, and that they will forbid Captain Sandeman s intcrfercnco ' with my subjects, either by assistance or promises. If this is done, I am certain that there ' will be peace and quiet in my country.' 11. Any one well acquainted with what has been going on, on this border since 1868, will see that in these few passages, the Khan lays the axe at the root of every thing, simply because a wholesome check to the growth of his unbridled power has been interposed. The tone, I would submit, is one, which should be improved by good advice, otherwise it may ripen into unfortunate action at an unfortunate moment. If it be really the voice of the ruler of Khelat which speaks, it only shows, what a marked differ ence the mercenary Brigade has already wrought, from the time when the homely unlana- tical tribes of Beloochistan were Khelat's household guards, and Jacobabad the only ac knowledged centre of power in the country. 12. Now, however, it will be seen from what follows, that a deliberate attempt is be ing made to supersede Jacobabad, and Deyra Ghazee Khan, as centres of power for the Bt'looch tribes in question, and to establish it at Khelat. Extract from Captain Harrison's Diary and correspondence ending with Political Superintendent's letter No. 1110, dated 21st July 1870. gin with him, on the subject of Captain Sandeman s visit to Kahun. Diary of May last, and had the corres pondence as per mar-13. Leaving that point however, for the present, all important though it be, I would solicit attention to the specific causes of complaint mentioned by the Khan, These are— 1st. That Captain Sandeman's correspondence with the outlawed Chiefs, would probably lead to another rebellion in the country. 2nd. That whilst Captain Sandeman was in the Murree hills making arrange ments with that tribe, they plundered Poolajee ; and that His Highness requests Go vernment to forbid Captain Sandeman from interfering with his subjects, by assistance or promises. 3rd. The Khan complains about some commercial project of Captain Sande man's, in connection with Kandahar and Deyra Gazee Khan, which Captain Sandeman himself will give an account of. 14. With regard to the first of these points, I can say confidently that, to do justice to these unfortunate nobles, by granting such of their demands as are reasonable, would not create a rebellion in His Highness' country. The Khelat Government have not yet tried that policy in the present ruler's time. If they would, they would soon reap the full bene fit of it. To curb the unjust and tyrannical acts of subordinates, to give real security to life and property, to impart general confidence by the character of the rule, will never drive Belooch and Brahooes into rebellion, though the contrary assuredly will, however fair the surface may appear for a time. Indeed, it is a fact which cannot be controverted, that it is the moral power of the Jacobabad field force, over the masses of Beloochistan, that maintains general tranquillity at all times, in spite of isolated ebullitions of rebellion. 15. It is a significant fact, that the Ameer Shere Ally Khan, has interested himself in such a marked manner on behalf of these unfortunate nobles, and their still more unfortunate families; and I hardly think that Khodadad Khan will address the Ameer of Cabool, accusing him of endangering rebellion in his country, by an act of sympathy and kindness. It is not however the cause of a few individuals that is involved in this matter. Khelat history shows, that the reigning faction inaugurated the present reign by syste matic attack upon the powerful classes in Beloochistan, which this handful of men repre sents ; a class that includes the real strength of the country, and as such is of much more importance to us nationally, than the present ruler at the head of his Khanazads and Mer cenaries. I submit that our power and influence should be used, to place the Khan at the head of a happy and contented people, as an honored and respected sovereign; and it can not be denied, that such an object is equally worth aiming at for the Khan's sake, as for our own. Such a policy would create no revolution, nor run the least risk of it. We should simply, by kindly aid and advice, lead the Khelat Government as it stands, to adopt the principles of a civilized and enlightened rule, and leave the rest to time. Results like these will never, I submit, be attained by agreeing with the Khan on all occasions, without reference to those principles of right and wrong, which are universal in their appli cation ; nor will they be obtained by swimming with the tide of Khelat politics, irrespec tively of their eventual tendency; illustrations of both of which lines of action may be found in the present correspondence. 16. The second cause of complaint contains a statement so calculated to mislead persons unacquainted with local details, that its complete refutation becomes necessarv. Yet the letter containing it was translated, and forwarded by the Political Agent for the information of Government, without one word of comment, as to its unreliability in the sense intended. The words are ' whilst Captain Sandeman was in the Murree hills, ' making arrangements with that tribe, they descended into the plains of Cutchee, and on' the 3rJ (instant) plundered the village of Poolajee, killed fifteen men, and carried off ' their cattle and flocks,' and this is adduced in conjunction with the intercepted corres pondence affair, as showing cause why Captain Sandeman should be forbidden by Govern ment to interfere with Khelat subjects any more. 17. Now, it is matter of little moment, but at the time in question, when the raid on Poolajee took place. Captain Sandeman was treating with Muh-ees at Maree, which is beyond Khelat territory, and belongs to British subjects of the Punjab. Be that as it may, however, the inference which distant authorities, who are unacquainted with border locali ties and quarrels, would draw from the general tenor of the passage is, that Captain San- deman's presence in those hills, and the arrangements, which he was then engaged in with the Murrees, were in some undefined, but objectionable way connected with the said raid on Poolajee; and accordingly that His Highness' subjects, as well as his dominions at Poolajee, had sustained serious damage, both owing to Captain Sandeman's presence and his arrangements. Hence the complaint. 18. If I have rightly stated the inference, which a stranger to this border would naturally draw from the passage in question, what will be his conclusion when I state distinctly, that neither Captain Sandeman's presence at Maree, or his arrangements with the Murrees, then or previously, had any more to do with causing the raid in question, in any sense whatever, than it had to do with the present war in Europe. Just as much. 19. The fact is, that precisely the same thing occurred between the same tribes about this time last year, and as matters at present stand, it is owing to want of outpost, or other arrangements on the part of the Khan himself, that this raid, the odium of which His Highness tries to fix in some unexpressed way on Captain Sandeman, took place, ihe sufferers are the poor wretched Khyherees, who are always complaining of their unprotect ed state. It appears that they have been in the habit of paying ' black mail to the Murrees for the protection of their flocks ; last year, however, the allowance of grain, which they had been in the habit of receiving from the Khan's Government was stopped ; and partly rely- iuo- on arrangfements which I had made with the Murrees at that time, and partly ow ing to O O 1 the loss of the grain, they did not pay the usual tribute. I however made Guzzen, the \ Murree Chief, refund on that occasion a good proportion of what they lost. Had they told me beforehand about the ' black mail,' I would have provided for it in some way or other, but they were ashamed to do so I fancy, and I only ascertained the whole story from the Murrees after the mischief had been done. This year Poolajee and the Khyherees were entirely dependant upon the Khan, and I learnt a day or two ago that His Highness has now ordered a small detachment for their protection, but it has not yet arrived. 20. Last year the Murrees justified their conduct in the matter, by saying that the Khyherees had not paid the usual ' black mail,' and this year no doubt the same cause pro duced the raid ; but the question is one entirely belonging to the Khan and his Eastern Cutchee arrangements, which I have pressed upon him ever since I arrived at Jacobabad. 21. Last year's raid is referred to in para: 12 of my report No. 1838 of 1869, dated 30th December 1869, as follows—' About the 20th July however an attack was made on ' the Khyherees, because the latter under cover of my arrangements declined to pay some ' ' black mail,' which they had for years been in the habit of paying, to protect themselves ' from Murree raids, and on the 21st idem I received another long letter from Guzzen, com- ' plaining of the auarchy in Cutchee, which was without any ruler.' 22. Having thus shown the injustice of the insinuation under reference, made by the Khan against Captain Sandeman, and his arrangements, I refrain from all comment on it. I cannot think however, that Captain Harrison, should have tacitly allowed the Khanto use a weapon of that sort, against a high officer of the British Government; and I am sure, that the Government will never allow Khelat correspondence to he carried on in that spirit. 23. This attempt to mix up other matters with the intercepted correspondence ques tion, has brought matters to a climax, and it only remains fur Government to decide, whether the Deyra Ghazee Khan, and Sind bor ler tribes shall henceforth be governed from Khelat as a centre or, as at present, from British territory. The present effort of the Khan, means nothing- more or less than that, in order that he may once more enjoy the subsidy of Rs. 50,000, (or whatever may be granted) for nominally keeping the Murrees and Boogtees in order. If granted, the result will assuredly be the same as in 1862, when the Government of India declined to pay any longer for work that was not done. The fact is that the Khan, as the Ruler of Khelat, and the constant inmate ( I had almost said prisoner) of that citadel, situ ated about 150 miles off, across a high and rugged range of mountains, never had, and ne ver can have, any real power over the Murrees and Boogtees. Under us, those tribes will become in time admirable border police, exercising, as they now do, so far as we have had means to employ them, a formidable and wholesome check upon border crime ; and in time of war, they will augment our force of Iwrder auxiliaries. Thus—in peace and war alike, they will be attached to us by the indissoluble ties of Military service, and frequent intercourse regarding their fields and other means of livelihood, precisely as all the other Belooch tribes within our border now are. Reverse all this, by placing them under Khelat, and what will be the result.? Simply, that they will become, as great a source of trouble and annoyance, as they were before 18G8, owing to the incessant intrigues and tricks of the Khelat officials, who would be appointed to manage them. In time of peace, instead of be ing our police, they would be Khelat police, and what is still worse, in time of war, Khelat auxiliaries instead of ours. We paying for their subsidy the whole time—and lastlv, the Khelat Treasury would be recruited, and the means of developing Khelat policy, and of consolidating its mercenary power to a still more objectionable extent than at present, bo obtained. 24. The stake is a high one, and the Khan has done his best to win it; but I sub mit that he has gone too far in making the original cause of grievance, which is to a cer tain extent a legitimate one; the pretext for cavalierly throwing over the Political Super intendent, manoeuvering in Khelat fashion against Captain Sandeman, and finally endeavour ing to renew his grasp on the means of subsidizing the Murrees and Boogtees. These mav be perfectly orthodox principles of Khelat Government, but I submit respectfully that they hardly accord with English procedure in the matter of treaty alliances, of the nature of ours with Khelat. 25. What makes this eccentric line of conduct on the part of the Khan the more markea, is the fact that he never used to raise these difficulties. Captain Harrison knows perfectly well, that it was Sir Henry Green, who first allowed Captain Sandeman to treat direct with the Murrees, because he (Sir Henry Green) declared his inability to protect the Punjaub border from their attacks ■ and the Khan never dreamt of objecting to the arrange- 1.

A\ hen a Political Officer at a Xative Court, fails to co-operate in supporting a policy resolved on by Government, he may, I submit, be fairly said to throw unnecessary obstacles in the way of such policy; I therefore respectfully solicit the decision of my own superiors in the matter, inviting attention to the gist of my 23rd para: above, viz. thatunder us, as now ordered, the Murrees and Boogtees are an element of strength. Under Khelat,as now advocated by the Khan, they will become an element of weakness and anxiety. In short, as I have observed elsewhere, it would be as reasonable to attempt the detailed ma nagement of tho. border tribes from Peshawur to Rajunpoor through the Ameer of Cabool, their feudal head, as for the Murrees and Boogtees to be either partly or wholly dealt with through the Khan of Khelat. We may use the Khan's name pro foi'nid, as I already do, but practically speaking, anything more would lead to failure.
