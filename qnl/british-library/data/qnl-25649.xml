Trevor while here discussed matter with me. Present position is that considerable amount of traffic is passing from Bushire to Shiraz via Shief, Angali, Shabankareh and Daliki thus avoiding the districts of the hostile Khans. Thus the route question is .pot at the moment pressing except as regards South Persia Rifles consignments. We cannot help thinking that notwithstanding any intimation which we may make personally to Barman Parma reserving our freedom of action we shall in practice he tied by his proceedings and negotiations with the Khans. I have just received a letter from Darya Begi in which he writes that Zair Khadhir and Shaikh Hussein’s behaviour continues to be so that he proposes to defer action and come to Baghdad unless he can be allowed and assisted to take some action against them/ Not content with preventing villages down the coast from paying revenue they have now sent threatening lettersf to headmen of villages of Bushire Island, Hallila and Reshire, for instance, demanding pay ment to themselves and not to the Governor under penalty of reprisals if they fail to comply. This, I submit, is the limit. Will it not he possible to let Darya Begi see what he can do. He is confident that he could dispose of the Khans given the requisite (support?) in material. Even if as is possible the enemy were to retire to the hills and not await attack Darya Begi would he able to demolish several of their habitations and shift Wassmuss. Any assertive action of this kind that he took might be accepted as sufficient to save Darya Begi’s face and meet our requirements, and Barman Parma could then be allowed to enter into relations with them if still necessary. It would seem especially convenient to costigate the Khans and shift Wasmuss at this juncture 'as it would probably deter Niedermayer from joining forces with them should he take southern route contemplated in Secretary of State’s telegram September 6th. Situation will, I trust, he reconsi dered in the light of the above observations. This is with reference to your telegram 1093-S. of 7th. 14 Telegram P..

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. foreign Office has sent me following telegram 287, 25th October. Recent telegrams received from you and Government of India regarding general Persian situation and question of South Persia Rifles have been carefully considered by His Majesty’s Government. Possibility of an attempt on the part of the enemy to invade Northern Persia cannot be entirely excluded, but it seems most improbable contingency, and His Majesty’s Government consider that wisest course will be to await developments in general position so far as may be possible. Nevertheless small raiding parties may be able to make their way across Persia as in 1915. As a check to such possibility the Russian cordon % always inadequate, may be now described as literally melting away. Your views are therefore requested as to whether the Russians would have any objection to His Majesty’s forces forming or helping to form a cordon from Birjand to Sarakhs. According to your telegram No. 354 (344 ?), October 14th, there seems to he no Persian Government with whom it would be worth while to negotiate. In any case His Majesty’s Government could not contemplate loss of control over or lowering of prestige of South Persia Rifles during the .war.2 It appears from your telegram No. 329, October 4tb, that you consider Vossuq-ed-Dowleh the most suitable Prime Minister. If an assurance to him of our willingness to negotiate with him as to post-bellum conditions would in your opinion help him to form a satisfactory Government, you may give the material support which you suggest. Some modifications in our existing policy might moreover be considered such as an approval in principle of formation of a Persian National Army—of which South Persia Rifles might subsequently form a part. You will realise un desirability however of giving away anything substantial in order to secure Persia’s goodwill in view of its doubtful value (and of improbability of Persia being a possible factor in war, regarding which I share opinion you express in your letter to Lord Hardinge, September 10th). Am I right in assuming from your telegram No. 319 that you consider that South Persia Rifles will not be able at present to ensure the opening of the Bushire-Shiraz road and that you still desire to press desirability of furnishing Parman Parma with a subvention for protecting these roads.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. Does paragraph 1 of your telegram No. 287 imply that it is not in contemplation to attempt to intercept raiding parties until eastern frontiers are approached and not to attempt it by employing subsidized friendly chiefs in other parts. It is possible that Agents will try route through Bakhtiari where they made a good many partisans and the subsidizing of Ilkhani who is very well disposed to us is recommended. * Something might also be done from Hamadan and perhaps Kermanskak.

(ii) Payment of Moratorium instalment in krans at a minimum rate of 55, but without control of mixed Financial Commission which should be dissolved. (m) Supply of arms. My answer was that this seemed to me an invitation to His MaiestyV Government to pay Persia to do what her own interests urgently required viz to get rid of incompetent Cabinet; and that the fact that His Majesty’ had made it, seemed to imply that he believed very high value was set by ourselves on Persia’s goodwill, whereas in reality it was Persia who stood in uro-ent need of our assistance. His Majesty's Government, now as always well d sposed to Persia, might be inclined to modify the Moratorium in direction indicated in (ii) but not to agree to disappearance of Commission ; as for (i) the most urgent need was question of bread in Tehran, and His Majesty’s* Government would possibly assent to the last six months arrears being given to a new and friendly Cabinet; as for (in) I doubted whether we could supply any arms. Kawam said that apart from the bread question, money was urgently required to enable the provincial authorities to restore order, and asked if His Majesty’s Government would not agree to subsidy for few months or for so long as we were satisfied with Cabinet. I asked what a friendly Cabinet proposed to do on its part; would it recognise and cordially support Sykes’ work? He replied that this could be easily done provided His Majesty’s Government would give a written under taking to substitute “ neutral ” for British officers after the war; or if we preferred to promise to discuss that question at the end of the war, the Persian Government would give same measure of recognition as late Cabinet. In conclusion Kawam remarked that his brother’s entry into Cabinet was by no means certain. I explained that these proposals were tantamount to a cancellation of those stipulations of August 1916, which could do Persia any permanent good and were not likely to be well received and would indeed be regarded as pre posterous if we had no guarantee of presence in Cabinet of Vossuk-ed-Dowleh in whose statesmanlike qualities His Majesty’s Government had confidence. I added that your views would be communicated to him as soon as possible. I would ' suggest sending a cool reply as I gather from your telegram. No. 287, that His Majesty’s Government think that we can afford to await developments.

I have the honour to forward a copy of a letter No. 52-1;., dated 28th June 1917, from the Officer Commanding, Sirjan, with a report from Captain Masters on the recent punishment of the Deh Chah robbers. 2. It appears from the report that the punitive operations were carried out with judgment and energy reflecting credit on Captain Masters and his command. It has been stated that some women were shot and I am making enquiries on the subject but such incidents, however regrettable, cannot always be avoided when a village is stormed. 3. I hope that punitive operations in various areas will finally convince the robbers, who of late years have made life intolerable for the peaceful peasant, that their occupation is now a dangerous one. I may add that the great land-holders are unanimously of this opinion. 4s.

Masters, 16th Rajputs, to the Officer Commanding, Sirjaq, dated the K^trp, 26th June 1917. I have the honour to report as follows regarding the recovery of stolen property from the village of Deh Chah. On arrival at Niriz I sent for Moavan-i-Diwan and found that he had done nothing. He put forward the excuse that he had no official position, but he had not even handed your letter over to the Governor, who knew nothing of the matter until my arrival. The Governor at once sent out messengers to Deh Chah to order the return of the stolen property. The answer from Deh Chah was that they were sending it in. I waited in Niriz for three days, and as at the end of that time there were still ^0 cattle to be restored, I told the Governor that I would go to Deh Chah myself and get these. I told the Governor to tell the people of peh Chah that I ^as going peacefully and would not harm the villagers and they were to have the cattle ready. Accordingly on the night of the 24th instant X marched to Hassanabad and pitched camp and at about 5 A.^t. on the 25th marched with a force to Deh Chah. On nearing the village I sent forward the Governor’s tufangchis to warn the villagers that I was coming and some 50 (?) or 50 villagers came out half a mile to meet me. I noticed that they were all old men or women. They had not brought the cattle and they wanted me to wait where X was while they collected the cattle and not to come into the village. J I said that I would proceed to the Kalantar’s house and wait there, and I moyed on. The women immediately began weeping and throwing dust over their heads. I went on and at about 500 yards the women bolted to the village and some five or six shots were fired at us from somewhere in the village. I therefore fell back on the infantry and organized a frontal and flank attack on tlie village both attacks reached the village simultaneously and with the help of rifle grenades the enemy were soon cleared out. J Ten of the villagers were killed; our casualties were one South Persia Rifles rifleman severely wounded in both legs. I sent him to Niriz at once. Everything of value had been cleared out of the village before our arrival, however I burnt a certain amount of bhusa and drove away the following livestock:—41 cattle, 19 donkeys and 4 horses.Jpmsdar Santa Singh, in charge of the Consular escort, surrounded and disarmed «ome 13 tufangchia of the Sahara Ashair. He says that they were firing on our party. I thought he must have been mistaken and restored their rifles and let them go. I wish to add that the behaviour of the South Persia Rifles was excellent- Naib Seyed Ali Khan has done very good work throughout. I am halting here to-morrow to rest the men and animals. Copy of an endorsement from the Officer Commanding, Sirjan, to the Brigade-Major, Kerman Brigade, No. 52-L., dated the 28th June 1917. I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of the report sent by Captain Masters, 16th Rajputs, of the operations against the robber village of Deh Chah. In the explanation I must inform you that the robbery of 95 cattle from Pariz about five weeks ago was traced to these people some time ago, and 1 told Captain Masters to see that these cattle were returned. It is presumed that th« South Persia Rifles horse saddle, rifle, &amp;c., of Sowar Vakil Ali was taken by this same band, as all our information points to that. One South Persia Rifles coat and shoulder chains have been recovered, also, I think, the South Persia Rifles horse. On this point further information will be given on the return of escort. Letters were written in advance to the Governor of Niriz and every effort was made to recover the property peacefully. Probably the effects of this action will he most important and prevent robberies in Sirjan by this and other small bands for some time. 122 No. 2192, dated Bushire, the 3rd (received 24th) October 1917.

Even at present, when Russia is engaged with her own affairs, and is proclaiming liberty and the British Government also clearly foresees her future perils and it is convenient for us to re-establish our relations and repair past damages, not only will we not work but we are unable to work, and a series of questions of second class and third class importance do not give time to our Government to take steps with brave determination for the introduction of reforms. We have degenerated to such an extent, that although the Russian soldiery have looted and burned half Persia still we stand staring at them, and do not even understand who has instigated this, and why it has so happened.V 6 In truth, we do not know the character of our relations with the neighbouring powers, who are forming Police and Cossack forces without any let or hindrance (on our part), and are paying their expenses out of the pocket of the nation without their permission and contrary to their wishes. The Gorernment of the day have refused to recognise the Cossack Division officially; the people also will not, naturally, recognise it, and the inhabitants? of every district have not welcomed it from the beginning. In spite of the proclamations which the authorities, who have been placed in charge of this scheme, have issued in the towns declaring that their proceedings are in conformity with the instructions of our Shah and in accordance with the orders of the Government, the people have not believed their statements and have not shown any willingness to be enlisted as Cossacks. For some months past the people of Khorasan have raised many outcries against the unsatisfactory conduct of the new Cossacks, and have thus shown their dissatisfaction at the scheme, but they have produced no result. On the other hand, although not a single Persian has been willing even to accept the idea of authorising the formation of the South Persia Police, and although the English themselves have understood this fact and are certain that the formation of the South Persia Police is repugnant to the character of Persians, and in conflict with general public opinion of all the classes of the people, whether civilians, tribesmen or nomads, and that it will not be possible at any time to reconcile the people to this self-styled and illegal force, still the. British do not desire in reparation for their unjust proceedings during the last few years to introduce justice and reform by removing from the garment of the integrity and honour of Persia this patch, which does not match it, and putting an end to British martial law in Persia, and they do not prove bv action in one of the corners of the world the general preachings of the orators of London. You will be surprised if you are told what is going on in Fars. The military censorship of the English has separated Fars, first from Persia and then placed it under the ostensible Government of Farman Farma and the real Government of Sykes. The lack of power of the latter and the defiant attitude of the tribesmen and nomads of Fars and the K.hans of Tanmstan Dashtisian, &amp;c., have limited still further the sphere of the authority of the governing powers in Fars. We are informed that at present the sphere of the influence of the British is restricted to the town of Shiraz, and two military forts near Shiraz and a few ports of the Persian Gulf. Plunder and insecurity reigns throughout the province of Fars, and even at a distance of four Farsakhs from Shiraz itself considerable quantities of merchandise belonging to the merchants have been robbed by bandits, while General Sykes is not able to secure the restoration of the goods, or to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Nasr Diwan after inflicting repeated defeats on the English and killine several British officers, Indian sowars, Gendarmes, etc., still maintains his position, and his defiance and force may increase day by day. It should not be imagined that we mean to condemn the British troops, and praise the bravery of the 1’ersian tribesmen and nomads as against the lean Indians 'Ibis is not our intention ; as a matter of fact, we admit the power and strength of our neighbours, but we wish to show that not only this question— the question of the South Persia Police—has not been settled in diplomatic circles of Persia, and is not officially recognised, but that the general opinion and the inhabitants of the sphere of the authority of the British viz the people of Pars. Kerman ail d all the southern part of Persia. haVe refused to agree to it. We can say that General Sykes has taken advantage of the silence of the people, and has maintained his position up to now, thouirh the execution of the scheme to this extent, even with this amount of expenditure even tor the desired end seemed impossible. The reason why General Svkes’ force has met with deieat wherever it has been sent, is that general oninicr. and public sentiments in the South have really refused to be brought under the iiiflueiice of bykes and his co-workers. ° uuuer r7 the Circ } 1 “ st ^ nce . s * the B «tish authorities, in spite of their tradi- » p r e r an ? ablllt y m all affairs of administration, are adherino* to the scheme, by the assistance of this factor (the silence of the people). In' 3 such a ^me as at present, when the Persian Government is anxious to renew her eiatmns with them (t. &lt;?., with England and Russia) and is prepared to adont neutrality, which she thinks advisable for her, it will be better and mor! econ mic, if they would adopt a more lenient and just policy, and esneciallv drop the question of the South Persia Police With TviZ to ltKljic opinion , a nd lielpthe Persian .Government in the formation of a uniform harmn^v wi!i7 0U - &lt;1 be ? bl ® to _ , ' estore order in all Persia and show their harmony with us in employing European officers from neutral countries. 123 No. 449-S., dated Busbire, the 8th (received 24th) October 1917.

I think explanation of correspondence between Wassmuss and the notables of Pars is probably that former writes to them and they acknowledge! Soulat, we know, has written to Wassmuss and so has Governor-General, as reported to you before. Quwam, I do not believe, is in constant friendly correspondence. Nasr-i-Diwan is just at present trying to curry favour with the Governor-General though doubtless he is double dealing like most of the others. Anyhow I no not think much importance need be attached to state ment so long as we are in our present strong position.

Depart- Please refer to your telegram No. 262. Military considerations of which I am totally ignorant appear to me to sgovern situation almost exclusively, but I would recommend that we should work on lines sketched by India assuming from general tenour of Government -of India’s telegram and from Tiflis telegrams Nos. 364 and 408 just received that probability that enemy penetration into Persia and buffer State Afghan- Istan, as its objective is serious and imminent and that any support whether military or political that Russia could give is negligible. It would be preferable to effect our change of attitude with stronger and more friendly Cabinet than the present one which is already tottering. I am of opinion that, if I could give Yossuk-ed-Dowleh a personal undertaking that we would come to a satisfactory arrangement at end of war as to South Persia Rifles, he would be able to get together a Cabinet of which he would he guiding spirit if not nominal head. I would promise to give him a considerable sum in cash down, Le., part or all of last 5 months’ instalments under Moratorium Agreement which would enable him to deal with bread question. I think Vossuk-ed-Dowleh would succeed with these cards in his hands and with such other help as I can indirectly give from Secret Service funds. He is supported by Sipak Salar and has considerable body of public opinion in his favour. Both have courage and would deal firmly with agitators, who, with blind disregard for every thing but their personal and party interests, are at present running things in Capital. In order to ensure his position we should also be prepared to agree to re vision of August Agreement as regards financial control ana further to guarantee from monthly instalments of Moratorium a minimum interest in krans. We might in the course of discussion on these matters endeavour without making it a sine qua non to obtain assurances on questions under (&lt;?) of my telegram No. 236. As Persia will always prefer to remain neutral, I must warn His Majesty’s Government that we can expect very little if any active assistance from any Cabinet. But from a friendly Cabinet such as one guided by Yossuk-ed- Howleh we shall often get unofficial assistance and countenance and will therefore not be hampered in any steps we may find it necessary to take whereas with a weaker or not friendly combination we should meet with constant obstruction and even covert opposition. Shah is a difficulty : though he is very alarmed at state to woicli this Cabinet has brought country yet with his constitutional timidity he cannot yet bring himself to adopt energetic policy Yossuk-ed-Dowleh has laid before him. When matters get a (little r) worse an appeal to his cupidity would probably bring him over. Though Persian Government might connive at it, it is very improbable I think in any circumstances that they would agree to South Persia Rifles being used as an auxiliary to Imperial forces. If by means of small groups penetration is attempted a small number of British officers might usefully be employed to form bands to catch enemy agents while cordon along Eastern frontier should be strengthened. As considerable expenditure will he involved and with calls of Russian troops on its resources Imperial Bank of Persia should by importation of iHver at once strengthen its position and I would also recommend that preparations be made to mint krans in Bombay in order that in the event of military situation in direction of Tehran developing unfavourably which would SLost certainly tend to a run of the Bank elsewhere, we may not find ourselves crippled for want on money.Telegram R., No. 175—161-S., dated the 4th (received 5th) October 1917.

Kawam is a spoilt youth with a large idea of his own importance. He expects much support from us and does little in return. With British aid however he (maintained) order to a considerable extent amongst Baharlus and other Arab tribes last spring. Soulat is a treacherous nomad Chief, unstable as quicksilver. He has kept his tribesmen from robbing on main road but has probably intrigued against our interests in many ways. v ‘ Both Chiefs realise that their interests to some extent lie with ours, but they are at heart hostile to us and would not help us out of a difficulty. They also realise that the establishment of law and order will lessen their power and influence considerably. It is undoubtedly desirable for the present to (keep) these Chiefs within our orbit, as we are thereby free to deal with minor robber tribes, and our power and influence are considerably enhanced by such opera tions. 88 Memo., No. , dated Basrah, (received 29th ) September 1917, From— Captain A.

Complete anarchy which coincided with closing of Lynch Road prevailed for some weeks but gradually Sardar Zafar with Sardar Ashja as Illbegi assumed direction of affairs. In the meantime Tehran Khans who saw a chance of regaining their former position and realised that this chance would be prejudiced by disorder in Bakhtiari were practically forced to accept Zafar and Ashja as only combination that could carry on Government. They accordingly telegraphed to other Khans in Chahar Mahal in this sense. Sardar Mohtasham and Murtaza Quli Khan could not openly disregard Khan’s wishes hut they decided to oppose Zafar in secret and make things (3) Telegram R., No. 411, dated the 8th (received 9th) September 1917.

This P°hey has been steadily pursued and has more than once nearly led to open rupture.

Ruling Khans state that with this assistance their position should be sufficiently secure to allow of our raising Bakhtiari Levies next year.

Bakhtiaris are at present unable to tackle Kuhgelu by themselves owing to internal dissensions and temporary impoverishment of their finances. 2. On the other hand process of gradual absorption is continuing and Bahmai originally a purely Kuhgelu tribe is now to all intents and purposes Bakhtiari. 3. Above process -will in time result in absorption of whole of Kuhgelu and this result may at any time be greatly expedited by amelioration of factors mentioned in paragraph I. 4. It would seem advisable that we should take advantage of present situation by offering Khans necessary assistance which will ensure preserva tion of Kuhgelu as separate tribal unit and establishment of our influence amongst them. 5. Assistance required is loan of two guns and payment of 50 to 7$ thousand tomans as contribution towards expenses of expedition. Disburse ment of this sum to be entirely in our hands. 6. Khans in return agree to (a) appointment of single Governor ia consultation with us. (5) Raising of Kuhgelu levies under British officer.

Noel’s telegrams 405 and 11. Zugmeyer’s diary shows Zafar did far more for us and, against our enemies than we supposed and I have always held that in view of course pursued by late Consul we could hardly have expected more,of him. At present he appears to be our only friend amongst Khans and I think it would be a pity to throw him over. , &lt;f , . He was much encouraged by the telegram of congratulation which you sent him on his agreeing to accept Illkhaniship and has been much dis heartened by recent absence of support from us. He has written and sent mess* ages to me on this subject more than once and informed me that he was only waiting Noel’s arrival to tender his resignation but I believe this danger has been averted for the present. I think that he well deserves the support suggested. Suggested threat to Mohtasham and Murtaza Quli Khan is well deserved owing not only to their intrigues against Zafar but also to their continued depredations in villages of Zil-es-Sultan’s family. Similar hint might suffice to bring Tehran Khans to their senses which appears to me to be necessary for intrigues in which they and Mohtasham and Murtaza Quli are engaged are not merely outcome of dissatisfaction with Zafar but are directed against us and existing regime in Persia. I hope to be able to let you have further inform ation on this subject in a day or two. (7) Telegram R., No. 417, dated the 10th (received Hth) September 1917.

As possible basis of agreement they suggest company should be formed and capital subscribed in equal shares by them selves and Lynch. Khans will hand over all caravansarais to Lynch and give them monopoly of sale of fodder. They suggest Lynch should send fully accredited agents to discuss terms with them.

Clear the line. Farman Farma received a telegram from the Minister of the Interior yesterday (Karguzar had received a duplicate four days before) to the effect that, since the South Persia Rifles are so generally disliked by Persian people, would it he possible for His Highness by augmentation of bis present force to ensure security of commercial routes and adding that necessary security had not been ensured by South Persia Rifles and that there is a menace that in future this force will be cause of great trouble for Persia. His Highness is convinced Cabinet could only have sent this tele gram at the instigation of Germans through Constantinople and he feels sure that, if he frankly opposes the suggestion, he will be still more hated by nationalists and his family and property will be in serious danger. His Highness, with your approval, proposes to report that to ensure security of commercial routes would require at least a Brigade with full complement of arms and ammunition, artillery, &amp;c., and that, since the present administra tion costs about 300,000 tomans a month while Swedes paid from 150,000 to 200,000, he would not be able to manage with fySss than latter sum alter the original cost of equipment had been met. His Highness proposes to conclude his telegram by saying that, if the Persian Government wish, he is prepared to enter pour parler with Consul and Sykes so as to come to some friendly and temporary arrangement (perhaps till end of war) so that integrity of Persia will not be endangered and power of South Persia Rifles will be ^nited. (Note.—This is obviously impossible and is merely by way of temporising.) His Highness will not send this telegram before the receipt of your reply and should you not approve, I request you will immediately inform me as to what form you would wish his reply to take. His Highness s real wish is that, if you have an idea of altering status of South ^ Persia Rifles, he should be given a hint, so that he may take steps to make it appear that suggestion comes from him, i.e., from party friendly to Great Britain in Persia and not that South Persia Rifles have been driven out of Persia by nationalists. His Highness said finally that, if you wish, he is prepared often (openly?) to oppose Persian Government, but should this be the case, there must be a fo^seen plan and arrangement suitably drawn up between His Majesty’s Government and himself. j a Addressed Tehran; repeated Bushire. n r\ !■ 50 Telegram R. t No. 18, dated (and received) the 22nd September 1917.

The explanation of the speech given by the Governor-General to His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, does not seem very convincing. No doubt he has to try and make friends with the democrats, but it seems to me that it would have'been better had he told His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, in advance that he intended to make such a speech, instead of having to explain it away afterwards when reports about it came back from Kerman.4 Enclosure No, 1, Telegram R., No. 509, dated the Slst August (received 2nd September) 1917. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kerman, To—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz. Printed copies of a speech purporting to have been delivered by Farman Parma on 2nd Shawwal have been received by principal officials and inhabi tants of Kerman. There can be no doubt they have been * * * in * * * by barman Parma himself. Speech begins with an amusing laudation of himself as a victim of absolutism and champion of freedom. This is followed by brotherly address to democrat audience inviting them without fear to form societies and hold meetings and assuring them of Parman Parma's assistance and support in everything connected with constitutionalism and demand for freedom. Parman Parma invited any one who had been fined by him personally to come forward and he would repay him twice the fine. Parman Parma also claimed credit for having in face of one thousand obstructions restored order throughout Pars; for having in spite of one thousand difficulties cleared political prisoners of the charges brought against them; and for having provided poor with bread, fire and doctors at estimated personal expense. British are not mentioned throughout speech. Parman Parma's appearance as patron of democrats has produced great delight in democrat circles here and unrest among all. Some affect to think that Parman Parma (nine groups omitted) our efforts to prevent democratic anarchy will now cease. Tone of speech, however, appears to me to be anti- British and its veiled object to show that Parman Parma has been and is doing all he can to favour and protect democrats and that his services to them are being accomplished in spite of opposition of the British. All responsible authorities here _ * * * protest against Parman Parma pushing his democratic propaganda in this way without obtaining their consent and I entirely agree with them. Can Parman Parma be asked to abstain in future from practising his personal or political manoeuvres in Kerman territory ? Addressed Shiraz, No. 509 ; repeated Tehran, 147, Bushire, 176.

I agree that Kazim’s presence in Tehran is not likely to affect situation there though it seems equally unlikely to benefit his mother here. Our con sent under pressure from (group omitted) to release every one who has done or tried to do us injury is ascribed here to conscious weakness on our part and reduces respect for us and is therefore to be deprecated. Moin-i-Sharia who was allowed to return to Kerman in November is continuously making use of his liberty to intrigue behind the scenes. Activity of Saiyid Mustafa and fact of Ali Khan being at large in Tehran (see my telegram No. 128, dated July 24th) and impending arrival there of the released prisoners from Shiraz are ascribed to weakness and not to clemency on our part and are likely to increase our difficulties.

Suggestions must necessarily be of temporary character and palliative in scope so long as question of South Persia Bifles and also larger one of our general attitude in Persian affairs remain unsettled. At present there can be no question of a real clearing up of the Bushire hinterland as suggested in telegram No. 945-S. from the Government of India nor indeed until South Persia Bifles have been brought up to efficiency and strength which would enable them to impose on rebellious Khans and even on Kawam and Kashgais authority of Government. Immediate objects for the present should be (a) keeping Bushire routes open, (b) security of roads in other parts of Pars and maintenance of decent administration. Parman Parma can probably achieve (a) by means of monthly subventions of above 5,000 tomans or less for each road and I would recommend that authority be given to His Majesty’s Consul to arrange matters with Parman Parma on this basis, but on the distinct understanding that any pardon His Highness may find it expedient to give hostile Khans does not touch us. As to (6), subventions to Pars administration will have to be continued, but I doubt present Cabinet will consent to prolong existing arrangements. His Majesty’s Consul is examining the (measures ?) requisite and I will sub mit recommendations as soon as I have received his report.

Hollowing is gist of inform ation given by him to Intelligence Officer re his doings after escape from Saidabad up to subsequent recapture here. When party escaped they went to Baharlu country. Bruggmann speaks very well of Abdul Hussein Khan who helped him. Soon after their arrival at Harab in middle of October 1916 Abdul Hussein received an official letter from Kawam ordering him to expel party and at the same time private letter saying no action need be taken. Party left Darab in Eebruary 1917 to avoid trouble after receipt by Abdul Hussein of a second letter ordering their expulsion. Bruggmann met Soulet at Chah Kazimi at the end of March and Soulet expressed regret that he could not give him much help just then owing to fall of Baghdad and other reasons and strongly advised him to join Wassmuss at Abram giving him safe conduct through his tribes. Bruggmann reached Abram with Oertel and Dettmar on April 4th this year. Dettmar died August 16th and Bruggmann having been suffering from pains in the back for some time got alarmed. He failed to get good lersian doctor to come out to Ahram, so against the advice of Wassmuss and Zair Khidar decided to go into Bushire for treatment. He left Dilwar by boat on evening of September 17th, arrived Sangi village morning of 18th, and was arrested as already reported. His first idea had been to enter Bushire openly, proceed straight to Governor giving himself up and claim protection of neutral. But no langis- tani boatmen would take him openly to Bushire fearing difficulties for them This combined with report in Tehran paper “ Watan of the re-capture of Baghdad by Turks caused him to change his mind and he determined to come secretly to Bushire disguised as a Persian getting medical treatm 9 . £ and when better find his way inland in Persian dress and work up to Tur Ir* if headquarters. He was convinced of his ability to do this once clear immediate vicinity of Bushire on account of his dark complexion and hair, thorough knowledge of Persian and friendship with Kashgais and Bakhtiari Khans.

From- 1 -The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. My immediately preceding telegram. Bruggmann gave following particulars about Wassmuss* position. He describes Wassmuss as having a lot of influence and ascribes it to his maintaining his position and dignity as the representative of Germany. Bruggmann says he has considerable correspondence with notables, keeps three Persian clerks, typewriters, &amp;c., he also has news-writers at various places and keeps abreast of political situation. Bruggmann says Wassmuss is in corre spondence with Turkish headquarters and German Government—in cypher with latter as he is now again in possession of official cyphers—also with Nadolni, German Minister-elect, who according to Bruggmann is on the way to Tehran and probably now with Turkish headquarters. Bruggmann states that most of notables m Pars are in correspondence with Wassmuss; Soulet and Kawam in constant friendly correspondence while Parman Parma occasionally writes, Nasr-i-Divan takes no important step without consulting Wassmuss-and Zair Khidar, Sheikh Hussein and Khan of Borasjun are completely subservient to him. Bruggmann says that feeling against British is getting stronger, Germans are not liked but as enemies of Britain are considered friends of Persia - Wassmuss gains friends by this feeling. Bruggmann emphatically declares Wassmuss’ credit is still good he has borrowed some 4 000 tomans but has reserve gold and bills drawn early in war to fall back on: his expenses are small, all information of messengers being supplied free. &amp; J * Bruggmann says one of WassmW chief preoccupations is keepin- the Bushne-Shiraz road disturbed Bruggmann also declares that there is s'tron- and growing feeling against British and South Persia Rifles especially in Pars and he does not foresee much chance of success for the latter; he considers Soulet and Kawam at heart anti-British (and feel?) resentment against the corps. ^ Finally he mentions that Dettmar who was pvTifiTf -ir* i * t their route between Saidahad and Darab hill of excellent graphTte. many 'out tT/oftppert' ^ ^ “ g0 ° d “ ^ “ Moroceo and® coLideraWe ^ul Addressed Tehran; repeated Baghdad, Basrah and Shiraz. 69 Telegram P„ No. 32S-F., dated the E8th (received 29th) September 19 17.

Accountant tells me flour here has all been sold and none has arrived since you left. According to accounts there ought to be some 10,000 mans at Lar, but it is probably adulterated and will not realise much. Loss on 750 tons amounts to about Ts. 11,000 to July 20 . If the present rates for transport on the Bushire-Shiraz road are not reduc ed, flour will arrive here at about krans 6*75 per man and if given shops at 5*50 it will involve loss of Ts. 40 per ton. P. P. however is convinced that he will be able to bring it up at krans 5, loss then would be about Ts. 30 per ton. Question as to route would presumably be decided when flour arrives.

Venture to suggest that it would meet the case if the Government of India gave facilities to the agents of Shiraz and Bushire merchants to purchase and export certain specific quantity of flour to Bushire, and also as an act of charity granted cargo space for it on transports coming to Bushire.A . This would enable merchants to get it up cheaply especially now that the kran is about 220 krans to Its. 100. For Government to purchase and despatch and Government officers to send upcountry and sell is troublesome and costly and also involves considerable loss to Government as is shown by Shiraz telegram, 235.

In my telegram, 143, I should have said permission to import might be given to Shirazr merchants or their Bushire merchants. I did not mean to suggest that Bushire merchants should import on their own account. As we could ascertain and inform G. G. approximate cost of flour in India, and of shipping it there and landing it here, and Governor could do the same as regards transport from here to Shiraz, I venture to think that the G. G. could fix maximum price without difficulty. Perhaps permission to import could be made contingent on intending importers agreeing to sell at prices not exceeding maximum price fixed by G. G. in consultation with His Majesty’s Consul. If this is feasible, it should be possible to regulate prices and prevent profiteering. Addressed Tehran; repeated Shiraz. Enclosure No. 5.

From-Bamam^a^Paacr Srxas, K.C.I.E , C.M.G., Inepector-General, To-Sm Charles Marling K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannia Majesty'e Envov “rsh:htts:. Pkn,potentiary atthe I have the honour to submit the following report to Tehran and back, by motor car. on my recent journey The party included Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter, who drove the 83 H. P. Hupmohile; a despatch rider on a motor cycle—who carried a servant m a side-car and, from Abadeh, a second despatch rider was taken on. Both these men had some knowledge of machinery and were very useful. 2. The journey would have been almost impossible but for the improve ments in the road between Shiraz and Hehbid which are being carried out and about which a separate report will be submitted, when they are completed. 3. We left Shiraz on the 28th May 1917. The Barman Farma had insist ed on driving me out for two miles, a signal compliment. His troops lined the road with some of the South Persia Bides and a troop of the 15th Lancers After saying good-bye, we passed through the Tang-i-Allah-u-Akbar, up a steep road Which has already been improved but the first serious obstacles which are being tackled, are the passes of Bajgah and Abarik, 9 and 14 miles respectively from Shiraz. The very steep rises are being replaced by graded tracks which will permanently improve a very difficult section of the road. Beyond Zarghun, where we passed Colonel Twigg’s column marching to Hehbid,* we raced across the level plain to the Band-i-Amir Biver, with its very steep* bridge : crossing it, we overtook Major Williams, Commanding Burma Mounted Infantry, who had picketted the road as a precaution. The Mervdasht Plain, on which celebrated Persepolis was built, is irrigated by a number of deep and wide channels, across which temporary bridges had been thrown, and, thanks to them, we crossed the plain safely and, following up the valley running north, reached Sivand. There we found Captain Williams, A.C.B.E., and stopped for the night after a short run of about 55 miles.r t-IP * 4. The question of the construction of a bridge across the river near Sivand and of a second bridge further up, had been a cause of some anxiety, but Captain Williams explained that by blasting a road with the help of a retaining wall, 800 yards long under some cliffs, the river need not be crossed at all and the distance would be decreased by four miles. This improvement was sanctioned. 5. Upon the road we passed through the Baseri tribe moving northwards. Its members had stolen some camels and goods from a merchant; these we recovered through the South Persia Bifles. Crossing the river by two temporary bridges, we traversed the Kasridasht Plain, then covered with the black tents of the notorious Kurshulis. Escorted by heads of our levies, we reached Sadatabad, a fine village of 400 houses, belonging to the Kawam-ul-Mulk. Beyond, the Tang-i-Kamin seemed likely to prove a formidable obstacle, but was not so, the track being fairly good throughout, although the loose gravel in the river-bed was trying. Above it, were the ruins of a dam and canal which carried water to the first Achaemenian capital of Pasargadae ; also, by means of a channel cut in the cliffs, to the Kasridasht Plain. To resume, the natural track was very good and we travelled fast, sighting the tomb of Cyrus the Great, at Pasargadae, rising like a white tower in the distance. A long ascent near Kadirabad was dangerously steep. This has now been graded and a well is being dug, breaking up the long waterless- lection. 6. At Dehbid, Captain Lilly met us, having ridden in on a motor bicyle from Abadeh. Dehbid lies at about 7,000 feet and we ascended steadily to the Kaoli Khush Pass which, although naturally good, is yet too steep for wheeled traffic. It too will be graded. We then passed through Khan-i- Khurri to Surmek, where we were welcomed by the Chief of our levies, who is a village notable. We reached Abadeh an hour after dark with a run of 130 miles to our record. 7. Prom Abadeh the going is good. At Yazd-i-Khast there was a very steep descent into the valley, and this was subsequently taken in hand. At Kumishah we were met by the Muaiyid-us-Sultan, nephew of the Zill-u- Sultan, and thence ran into Ispahan over a very good road, to be there welcomed by Colonel Haig. 8. Leaving Ispahan we quitted the main road at Murchikhur, some 30 miles to the^ north, and, keeping to the west, traversed the district of Mahallat, rejoining the main road at Kum. Petrol duly reached us at a hamlet on the road and relieved us of much anxiety, and from a stage some 30 miles north of Kum we ran into Tehran. The total journey worked out at some 600 miles which was accomplished in stages goino &gt; north and in 5 stages on the return journey. Por an undeveloped country the going was wonderful, and in places a good rate of speed was maintained. &amp; North of Yazd-i-Khast there w^as no natural obstacle to be cut through* or avoided. The fact of the year being a dry one was favourable. 9. At Tehran, Sir Charles Marling introduced me to His Majesty the Shah, to the Ala-us-Sultana, and to other Persian officials. The Ala-us- Sultana, whom I had known for over 20 years, received me in the most friendly spirit. I gave him a detailed account of my doings since my return to Persia, and he promised me his full support. But when he visited His Majesty’s Minister, he hardly acted up to his professions. The temporary paralysis of Russia was then at its worst and the Persian “ Democrats ” took the fullest advantage of it. In this connection,there were some assasinations and the Prench Minister warned Colonel Hunter and myself that we were in danger of a similar fate. 10. The return journey was delayed by the breakage of a shaft at Ispahan. A new shaft was made and tempered with some difficulty and tne journey was concluded without incident, thanks to Colonel Hunter’s skill 11. It now remains to give my impressions. Generally speaking I was most favourably impressed. The road was safer than for many years andb ^ th and r ere travellin g al °ng it and refusing escorts: Thanks to the efficiency ot the South Persia Rifles, everywhere the people were reaping in peace, whereas last year the nomads plundered the ripe crops! Moreover this year locusts have done very little harm and the crops are good. The arrangements come to by His Majesty’s Consul with the Kawam and Souiat, have materially aided in the improvement of the situation, apart iiom the fact that our caravans under necessarily small escorts have been moved all oyer the country without a single case of serious attack. The money that is being expended on this work is well laid out and has probably saved repeated military action at a difficult period. r J To give a concrete example, the Governor of Kumishah said that last year he himself had suffered from ten robberies of cattle, sheep, etc. bv midsummer, but that this year these robberies had ceased owing to the orders of the Soulat-ed-Dowlah. On the reverse side is the fact that the dismissal of the capable Zargham-ed-Dowlah, has encouraged the enemies of law and order in the Ispahan Province. 12. At Abadeh, the state of affairs is most satisfactory. The British officers and non-commissioned officers are on excellent terms with their Persian comrades and in a recent successful skirmish with robbers, the Persians had highly appreciated British valour, while the British spoke highly of the courage displayed by the Persians. Owing to this discipline was very good. The barracks were clean and there was a feeling of progress in the. air. The drilling and stable management were good. Captain Lilly has already made a name for himself for energy, capacity and tact, which, in itself, will make the pacification of the country easier. On the other hand, it must be remembered that constant attempts are being made by “ Democrats” to excite disaffection in the ranks and it would be unwise to ignore their efforts. 13. At Dehbid, upon the return journey, we were met by Major Williams of the Burma Mounted Infantry. He reported a very successful attack on the Kurshulis who had stolen 600 sheep and declined to return them. Making a night march of 32 miles, partly over a range, with his Burma Mounted Infantry and a double company of the 124th Baluchistan Infantry, he attacked the Kurshulis who held a fort and were supported by contingents from the Kashgai and Baseri, news of the intended attack having reached them. In spite of intense fatigue, the fort was attacked and taken, and con siderable casualties inflicted on the Kurshulis, whose loss in dead alone was 23 against or e man killed on our side. A separate report on this brilliant little affair will be submitted later. 14. In conclusion, Sir, the restoration of order and British prestige, together with the re-establishment of the authority of the Persian Govern ment, have made immense progress during the last few months and, so far as Pars and Kerman are concerned, there are only a few Khans near Bushire, who are still in rebellion. It is unwise to prophecy and impossible to forecast the changes in the political situation, but provided that the system which is now working is not upset but developed, and provided that the temporary pecuniary subsidies to the Kawam-ul-Mulk and Soulat-ed-Dowlah are continued, it may be confidently expected that the ask set will be accomplished. 15.

Proposed movements in September.—In September 1917, it is proposed to bring m the Indian troops’ detachment from Dehbid to Shiraz, the posts at, and near, Dehbid, being taken over again by South Persia Rifles* detachments from Abadeh, which are at present concentrated for training. In September 1917, it is proposed to send about 200 rifles (1 company) of the 1st Infantry, South Persia Rifles, from Bunder Abbas to Tarum, when the 2nd Squadron, Burma Mounted Infantry would rejoin the Mounted Infantry Head Quarters at Shiraz. 3. General situation .—The situation in the Kerman Province is quiet and promises to improve constantly. The Quyvam-ul-Mulk at present has his Areb tribes well in hand, thanks to his operations during the spring of 1917. The general situation in the Pars Province is promising, and law and order is being restored along the main routes. The resumption of active operations in the war by the Russians has had a good effect. The recent minor operations near Abadeh and Deh Bid, against robber Illiat tribesmen, have had considerable effect and caravans are moving freely between Shiraz and Ispahan. Practically the only unsatisfactory feature is the attitude of the chiefs and tribes who inhabit the districts along the Khan-i-Zinian-Kazerun-Borasjun- Bushire road. The fanatical mullahs of Shiraz and a few Persian democrat emissaries from the north, are the main fomenters of anti British doctrines in Pars, but their actiyities are of a political nature, and are not likely, as far as can be foreseen at present, to bring about any disturbance demanding serious military action. d. The Kazemn- Bushire road .—The Kazerun-Bushire road remains closed to ordinary traffic. A considerable amount of Persian trade is passing along the route via Piruzabad. The Kazerun, Borasjun, &amp;c M chiefs and people are the declared enemies of the British and are rebels vis-a-vis the Persian Government, in that they disregard orders from Tehran and refuse to pay any taxes. Wassmuss, the German ex-Consul, still finds a refuge among these tribesmen. Law and order is not likely to be established in this district until these chiefs and tribesmen have received severe punishment by means of active military operations. There is the chance, however, that the improvements in other parts of Pars will re-act there, and that the local land-holders, cultivators and tradesmen will themselves bring about the re-opening of the Kazerun road, as tue material interests of these classes suffer by the closing of the road. A temporary agreement has been made by the Consul, Shiraz, with Soulat- ud-Dowleh, the lllkhani of the Qashqais. This agreement is of value, as affording time and opportunity for organization and training of the South Persia Rifles. Soulat-ud-Dowleh appears to be a man of considerable ability, subtle and avaricious, but lacking in strength of character, and probably a coward at heart. His control over the unruly and semi-independent branches of the Qashqais does not appear to be a strong one. It is not considered probable that the attitude of the chiefs and tribes along the Kazerun-Busbire road will force any military operations upon us, so long as this road is left entirely alone..1 5. Military policy.-+Thexe are two main lines of military policy open to ns in the near future— (d). To plan and undertake military operations in the near future against the chiefs and tribes along the Kazemn-Borasjun- Bushire road. (B) To avoid any military operations in this region, as far as possible, and to leave the Kazerun-Bushire road closed, as at present, but with goods passing from Bushire to Shiraz, v/d Eiruzabad. 6. Discussion of policy “ A —Eor military operations between Shiraz and Bushire (Alternative “A ”), the co-operation of a force from Bushire is essential, and it should not be less than two Brigades, and should probably be one Division. For simultaneous operations from Shiraz, towards Kazerun, it would be possible to concentrate at Shiraz— Indian troops South Persia Bides, Persian troops 1,500 1,500 3,000 It is estimated that these troops from Shiraz could fight their way to Kazerun, in the face of probable opposition which might be expected at this end, with simultaneous action being taken from Bushire. The approximate dispositions would include— At Shiraz • • • • • • 1,000 At Khan-i-Zinian • • • • •• • • • 600 At Dasht Arjin • •• • • • • * • 300 At Kutal-i-Dukhtar • • • • 100 At Kazerun ... • •• ... 1,000 3,000 The tribesmen profess a contempt for the British in general, and for Indian troops in particular. The theatre where fighting is to be expected, is mountainous and difficult. The tribesmen are well-armed with modern rifles, but are not good shots, and their supnly of ammunition is somewhat limited. They willingly buy ammunition at 2 Krans per round. It is probable that the local chiefs would assemble their men and fight and this would be satisfactory, as tending to permit of casualties being inflicted and so avoid a prolongation of operations into guerrilla tactics. The most favourable date for the commencement of operations lies bet ween 15th October and 15th November. Ordinarily, with adequate supply and transport preparations, the whole operations should be over in six weeks from Christmas to the end of February, the passes near Dasht Arjin are liable to be blocked by snow. Six weeks’ notice of operations is required at Shiraz, to enable supply and transport preparations to be made. Without previous and adequate stocking of supplies at Khan-i-Zinian, and in the South Persia Rifles post near Dasht Arjin (Burj-i-T imuri) suitable action from Shiraz would be almost impossible. On the conclusion of a successful campaign, South Persia Rifles garrisons would be placed at certain points, including— Approximately f At Borasjun j At Kazerun ... v At Kutal-i-Dukhtar 250 700 50 1,000 ■aJ &lt;theatre. ^Thf 8 t l' e f l ? espat f h ° f reinforcements for operations in a minor preferable at thp 10U t '°^ a ^ terna ^ ve “ ^ ’S therefore, appears to be p eierable, at the piesent juncture, from a military point of view.

From—The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreig-n and Political Department, Simla. I send herewith, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the Persian newspaper “ Iran ” No. 102, dated 23rd July 1917, with English translation of a portion of it, as received from the Acting British Gonsui for Arabistan, Mohammerah. BRIEF TRANSLATION. From the Caucasus’ newspaper. “India should be saved” The first duty of the Russian Democracy is to end the war and establish peace without annexation of territories or demanding of indemnities. The idea of each nation for independence in the present state is not to get liberty and independence for Poland, Alsace-Lorrain, Transylvania and Armenia which caused the present war between the powers, but originally for India, Ajamistan, Korea, Siam and Egypt which up to the present moment were under the heel of those who had the intention to conquer the world. These countries which are in the grip of injustice should be saved from such policy. The Socialists of all nations are showing their disgust of such policy, viz., the intention of conquering the world and tiie idea of Imperialism, the original of which is the unjust policy of England, and these Socialists confirm that the same countries are liable to full liberty and independence. The well-known British newspapers which are always supported by the bribes and money of the rich people of England in the last two years introduce Great Britain as the protector of all tne small nations while not a single Socialist in the world agreed to this opinion and they (Socialists) admit tnatthe British policy is to abolish the liberty and independence of all the small nations. The proof of this matter is, India and its ill-treatment by the British Government in that country. At the meeting in Amsterdam while the Socialists heard the speech of Dadabhai Naoroji (an Indian), they all showed their disgust at the cruel policy of England in India and they all agreed to the following arrangements The Delegates of workmen of all the world’s civilization have noticed the unjust treatment of the British Government in India, viz.&gt; the confiscation of all Indians’capital and giving them (Indians) hard work with small pay, causing 200 millions of them to live hungry and poor, therefore, the Inter national Society of Workmen appeals to Great Britain and desires that Govern ment to discontinue such policy which is the policy of cruelty to the colonies and propose to the Darbar of London to grant independence to India. The Indian representative named Kamar made a warm speech at the Conference of the Socialists of the Stuttgart regarding the difficulties of Indians, and stated that India has been destroyed by the cruelty of England and the people of India have undergone the utmost difficulties, poverty, starva tion, &amp;c. A sum of 35 millions of Liras (the produce of vast India) is being sent to England annually, and not a single dinar will be sent back to India, hut England is paying 7^ shahis a day causing starvation and sickness to the Indians. I, in the name of humanity, ask you, why so many millions of people should suffer and meet such difficulties and miseries while the total population of India forms I-5th of the population of the world ? Is it worthy that two hundred million people should suffer so greatly under the despotic wishes of the British Government and the world’s civilization should not be sorry of the present state of the people of India ? We desire that India should be given independence and wish that the Indians should be treated well in the way of justice and righteousness. At the Society of Stuttgart, the workmen’s representative of England promised finally to make every arrangement for the liberty and welfare of India. The arrangements were published in all the European countries, but unfor tunately during these three years of war, no steps have been taken by the liberals towards the Indians. In the year of 1911, the Indian Liberals through the cruelty of the European Liberals have been imprisoned, murdered, deported, &amp;c. The steps taken by the English people against rebellion in India through their military authorities, have never been done by any civilized country in the world, which resulted in the miseries of the poor liberals of India, and the European Liberals never protected against such cruelty, but inspite of all such cruel treatment, the Indian Liberals in India are improving every day, and we are congratulating such liberals and wish them every success and prosperity. The Hindus deserve liberty and independence before any other nation.

It appears that Democrat Section of Cabinet has succeeded in preventing any further steps against Terrorists. Press is accusing Chief of Police of having exceeded his powers over the recent arrests. No steps are being taken by Government to express public approval of his action. Most virulent attacks against us and Parman Parma are published daily ; according to my information some of them are being made under threats from “ Committee of Punishment ”, which has addressed menacing letter to Cabinet itself s demanding that criminals recently arrested should be released. Worst characters in Persian politics are returning to Tehran which is filled with rumours of revolution. It is certain nothing will be done so long as Cabinet remains as now constituted. I have told Prime Minister that if his Cabinet is not reconstructed in such a way as to allow him to take energetic steps against Terrorists and Press, he will he inviting anarchy. But I fear warning will be vain as he is quite senile and the other moderate Ministers are timid and weak, Russian Minister agrees with me that best thing is a complete change of Cabinet.

Governor-General requests that flour may again he sent from India for sale in Shiraz this winter to supplement local supply, as harvest has been short o win o' to failure of rain, actual depredations by locusts and fact that very ittle wheat was sown owing to fear of locusts. This year wheat will be sown md if normal rainfall is received, no further help will be required. Governor-General asks for 2,000 tons, but I consider 1,000 would be sufficient. Out of last year’s consignment of 1,750 (750 ?) tons, I supplied South Persia Rifles with small quantity. It has been impossible^to complete accounts for last year’s importation yet but total loss on 1,750 (7o0 ?) tons is estimated at about 15,000 tomans. This year if free transport be supplied to Bushire it should he possible to reduce losses as flour would come via Eiruzabad under the protection of Soulet who has promised to giro assistance.

Parsees here are discontented with Ardeshirji on the ground that in 23 years during which he has represented Indian Parsees and administered funds sent by them he has never exerted himself to benefit Parsee communities. They contrast him unfavourably with Kaikhcsro whom they say he has sometimes tried to thwart when working in Parsee interests. In Yezd through the control of Indian funds he has succeeded in keeping the election of members of Parsee Anjuman in his own hands with unhappy (results). Pour years ago Kerman Parsees complained against him to Bombay on the ground of incompetency, but the Bombay Parsees did not take the matter up. Yezd Parsees have again recently complained objecting to selection of Anjuman members by Ardeshirji, and ten days ago, Kerman Parsees also telegraphed against him to Bombay and have since written. Complaint is a joint one as regards demand for a representative who will push Parsee interests and see that funds are beneficially expended.

Paradumbeh, Dear Mr. Pashchen, 23rd Pebruary 1916. To my delight I learned from your letter that the situation in Abadeh has altered very much to your advantage and that most of the Kashgais there and in the surrounding country are in good and friendly terms with you. I am very interested Ho hear that other Khans also besides Ayaz Kikha are ready to join at a given moment, as troublesome a movement as we can collect in time and recruit with money. Under the circumstances I hope you will approve of the scheme that you should remain there for the time beinn* in order to be ready to receive those who wish to go with us and to win over new friends. It is not yet possible to say when a move can be made from here against Ispahan. The dissension among the Bakhtiaris—a success with which I must for the present be contented—hinders the free mobility of those whom 1 have won over for us. The llkhani and his representative are completely under the influence of English money. To my joy the eldest son of Zargham, Abul Hassan, arrived here a few days ago and is ever ready to work with us, after he fought very heavily againsn the Russians. Unfortunately, however, he was not the bearer of any too good news. After the occupation of Kermanshali by the Russians he took part in the retreat of the Turks to Kasri Shirin and Kkanikin, and was an eye-witness of the disaster near Kasri Shirin. The Turks, who apparently fought bravely, were not nearly numerous enough. After the occupation of Khanikin by the Russians, Abul Hassan made his way throngli the country of Pusht-i-Kuh where he met a Russian column, which was on its way to join some English troops in Dizfui. Abul Hassan was captured by a party of these troops while crossing a large river, but he killed two of them. The fact that in spite of it all he is not discouraged and is willing to work again is very gratifying to me. And yet it is only natural that here, as in other cases, the carrying of munitions, weapons and firearms is very difficult. The capture of Baghdad by the Russians at Khanikin would have been inevitable, had not the Turkish troops had a free hand, for the first time, after the success at Kut-aRAmara, There at Kut the Turks succeeded after a five-month’s siege in forcing General Townshend’s division to surrender, thereby rendering possible a further advance of the Turks to Amara : however it is rather early yet to believe in the occupation of Basrah by the Turks. The Russian advance has now caused the unfriendly Bakhtiaris to suffer from swollen-head, and the llkhani, Sardar-i- Muhtasham, who is a tool in the hands of the English, has already taken unfriendly steps against me. To the indirect order to leave the country—to which, though secretly, the authority of the Tehran Government was given—I sent a couple of long and absolutely unanswerable replies; and I continued to work the coalition which was friendly—though unfortunately weak—against theiV A '25 x ^— ^ o^vyuj. v y piCciyeu (U UllS. Well, goodbye?. I hope you are keeping fit. I hope that the severe rheu- niatism which I contracted in windy Simirun and in, the ten life will not degenerate into chronic rheumatism. A short while ago a messenger came here from you at Niris with a letter for Seiler at Shiraz. The man had not been able to deliver the letter, for Seiler &amp; Co. were prisoners in Shiraz. I have sent your letter, together with a letter from me regarding your situation. My situation and circumstances in Ispahan,' such as they are known to me, by the same messenger to the new Eiiyoy at Kermanshah. No doubt some German or other will receive the letter and forward it to its correct address. Meanwhile many changes have taken place. I have at the present moment from 1,500 to 3,000 men at my disposal. Kardoff is said to have about 2,000 Bakhtiaris who wish to make for Ispahan. Kardoff is supposed to be against this at any price and the reason is quite unknown to me. I have my own opinion about it, but I do not wish to reveal it here, as it is possible, perhaps, that I am mistaken. In any case it is certain that only a small Russian force is in Ispahan and that Bakhtiaris and Kashgais are ready to march there. As a change for the better seems to be commencing in Shiraz, I hope that Tvhen Ispahan and Abadeh are again in our hands, Shiraz too will be strongly influenced thereby. I await cypher I must see later how the force can be turned to best account. The line Kermanshah, Kangavar, Burujird, Sultanabad is occupied by our troops. Hamad an seems to be held by the Russians still. Basrah has been taken by the Turks and Germans as no doubt you also know. I should like to ask you, dear Herr Professor, for your opinion, in as exact and detailed report as possible, on affairs down there. Also on Kerman, &amp;c., Yezd seems to be little disturbed by the English yet; at best I have favourable news from there and from Abargu. I have the impression that now at last a great change will take place here in the south. Also from Tehran I have good news. I should really thank you very much if you would write me your views for the future is very uncertain. I could als6 forward in perfect safety letters and despatches from you to the Legation, &amp;c.

I did not see the messenger myself; we are too closely watched for that ; he handed the letter over to Prau Roever who is occasionally allowed to visit her interned husband. This letter goes back in the same manner (? and) Muhammad AM should go on direct to Kermanshah with reports from me and Seiler, which have also been handed over to him, or to whatever point he meets the Germans.

Should you have no money, comfort him anyhow with Kermanshah and give him a cheque on that place if necessary. Griesinger, Biach, Wediq and I had reached a point far beyond Bam when we heard of the German break-up in Persia. In Bam whither we returned on March 80th, we also learnt of the evacuation of Kerman by Seiler’s party. We then attempted to reach Shiraz with all possible speed. On April 9th we were attacked near Baft by a party of Bakbtiaris (horsemen belong to Governor of Kerman). Most of our sowars fled and with them Biach who was taken prisoner and handed over tO| the English in Bunder Abbas. We now lost 10 men killed and the rest fought on till dark, when we decamped. The caravan was lost. Griesinger Wedig and I with 8 men marched through the mountains towards Kiris. On 15th April we were surrounded by Arabs of a nomad tribe, fell upon, taken prisoners and looted, but released again with arms and horses; but most of the gold which we still carried in our saddle bags was taken from us. In Niris the brother of Mansur-us-Snltaneh received us in a friendly manner. The next day he informed us that he would have to imprison us bv order of the Government. They deprived us of our arms and we were kept prisoners there till May 18th. Then we were brought here where we have been interned since 23rd May with Seiler s party, Soever, Angmann, Evieson, Petzold and Lassu together with Professor Schroder. We weie well treated but so strictly watched that it was only with greatest difficulty that we could receive and send news. Eights between Gendarmes and the Qawam have not occurred since we arrived 0 here. Soulat-ud-Doulah is carrying on a little war against Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashguli; latter is in treaty with Wassmuss, Por the rest Soulat and Qawam are behaving well and are not ill disposed to us. Theaipa '27 //V—^ . i: Gendarmerie is powerless and obeys the Governor but a portion of the Gendarmerie is on our side. The situation is contiinially changing and cora- pletely obscure. At first everyone was afraid of the Government. If the erman-Turkish advance continues and the Russians have to evacuate spahan, we shall certainly regain our liberty ; presumably an order to this effect would come from Tehran. Also Earman will certainly not come here it there is danger m his rear. I believe no longer in any German help for us from Persia. If Germans and lurks get the upper hand in Persia as at present the Russians, then will this “ nation of swine ” become afraid of us and again pluck ur&gt; courage. One bears nothing of the English. Sykes is supposed to be in Kerinm, but I don't believe this ? s I only heard it as a rumour some three weeks ago. We can’t get into direct communication with Wassrauss. He gives no news of himself and nobody knows for sure where he is. The Shiraz English men are still sitting tight in Borasjun. Otorias is interned in Sirjan^with one or two wounded. Your brother arrived in Herat only 24th January, the other Afghans (sic.) in Kabul. No progres s is being made there. That is all I know. lam sorry I can send you no whisky; we are not free enough here for that. Hearty greetings from us all. Yours, E. ZlTGMAYEE. Enclosure No. 4 to Serial No. 36. Shiraz, 10th July 1916. Under the circumstances I beg you to excuse the form of this report; it seems quite uncertain whether I shall be able to send it at all. Already in my first dispatch from Ispahan I pointed out the difficulties of our position, because our power in Persia developed so late that even Ispahan was occupied by the Russians. • Through the order of our representative at Baghdad I had been appointed to take charge of the Consulate at Ispahan bn December 18th. I had I authority to leave Ispahan and to make for Kermansbah ; also according to | orders from the General Staff at Baghdad, news of which reached us from Baghdad after the middle of January we were to hope for a timely arrival of help, I personally was to await the entry of the wireless party. Then on February 6th I received orders from the Charge d’Affaires for Persia, Herr von Kardoff, in view of the expected occupation of Ispahan, to move the Consulate belongings into safety at Abadeh and to open a temporary Consulate there. But I beg to be allowed to describe more fully in a further despatch my activities in that place. Already during this removal I was threatened with a surprise attack; a first intimation that we Germans were generally already considered. On 26th Eebruary when I was carrying out a reconnaissance from Abadeh towards Abargu with a letter from Dr. Mehdi Khan to collect Ts. 2,000 from the Sardar, I learnt with certainty by the surprise attack on the gendarmerie escort in Abargu that the Governor, on instruction from Tehran, was intriguing against us with the robber chiefs. On March 4th Herr von Kardoff arrived at Abadeh on his return journey, after the most evil experiences with the most expensive Mujahids and gendar mes, with the news that Erzeroum and Kermanshah had fallen. In Yezd there was no Governor ; my request to go there and to make sure of ‘ s our” revenue failed through the disinclination of Herr von KardofS as well as Major All Ghuli Khan in Shiraz, to provide me with the necessary 40 gendarmes. I saw that for months hence there was no possibility of a pro fitable activity on my part and so I determined, in agreement and with the support of Herr von Kardoff to make an attempt to break through tom Mesopotamia via Bhiraz.

I beg to send details of this letter.' t + 1 fi T S lJ 3 ! lekled on the tabIe of m J ^nt as a mule load and afterwards I travelled to Shiraz on a stretcher belonging to the Gendarmerie Hospital and arrived at about 20 hours on the evening of April 5th ; I had been able to aress up my wound sufficiently well with my hand drug stores. That same night the complete political revolution in Shiraz took place, wtih manv ominous signs. The Germans, Harr Boever and Herr Petzold. were immediate ly imprisoned, my own fate was absolutely uncertain, the more so as the ruler Fath-ul-Mulk explained to my munshi who was led before him • “ Mr Petzold est un machiniste, mais Mr. Professor. Schroeder est celui qui fait toujours du feu ”, 4 However, I was spared the loss of the rest of my money and belongings and remained undisturbed in hospital. I also found it possible early on April 6th, in spite of fever caused by my wound, to burn my entire correspondence includ ing the telegraphic key and wireless code. The repairing apparatus I had myself already on April 1st given into safe keeping here. After that, for'more than two months, until June 17th, the date of the attempted escape of two of the sick, I had a very bad time ; very little food, such a hard bed that after eight days I could no longer lie on it without great pain and could no lono-er sleep without S or 4 large doses of opium a day, besides a very painful wash ing of my wound by the terrible democratic Major Hr B. Only to-day was I able to walk a few first weak steps without a stick. I am convinced* that I shall be restored in a few weeks to work on behalf of my country. On April 21st the Kerman division of the Niedermayer expedition was brought in here completely plundered, and in the beginning of May, also Professor Zugmayer and his companions, These gentlemen have since been entirely cut off from the outer world ; are in fact prisoners. Neither of the doctors were informed of my request that they should visit the sick. In spite of this Hr. Becker was able to see me twice. I myself am, however, free to do what I like in the hospital, but have not | the permission to leave it, as in fact, it would hardly be practicable yet for | me to do so. In any case, we are absolutely helpless here. It seems worth | the trouble as a reprisal to imprison the members of the Persian Embassy in | Germany (naturally also their relatives) and to confiscate all Persian property. The details of my experiences, of which I shall inform you as soon as vve have obtained safe communications, make me wish, even more than formerly, that there will be a division of Persia, with a share for the Turks (Kermanshah, Azerbaijan and the Persian Guif) for only then could one hope lor better conditions in t his most putrescent of all countries. Once again I beg the Foreign Office to see that there is paid to Charlotte Haun for me the 400 Marks a month that 1ms been alloted to me in additionto my ray f^onWoly 15th, 1915.

Imperial German Mission in Constantinople. 37 Telegram P., No. 202-F., dated the 13th (received 14th) June 1917. From—His Britannic Majestps Minister, Tehran, T°—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. 1 I have discussed Soutli Persia Bides with Sykes and Colonel Hunter his late Chief of Staff and come to conclusion that it is impossible under existing system of control both on technical and financial matters to expect good progress with organisation and that it is essential that Inspector-General should be given much greater latitude. At present Government of India apparentiv intend that force should be organised on model of Imperial Army. If South Persia Rifles formed part of latter rigid adherence to it would be justified and necessary. As the South Persia Rifles, however, is a Persian force It is neces sary to introduce such modifications as experience shows to be required by local conditions. Revision is also necessary in the conditions of service and appoint ment of officers. There seems to be no adequate reason why appointments in a Persian force, permanent in the case of Persian officers and temporary in the case of British, should not be made on authority of Inspector, subject to approval perhaps of Persian Government but without reference to Home; while as regards conditions of service it is obvious that if good results are to be obtained something must be done to render them attractive. There is so much uncertainty at present that even Chief of Staff does not know what pay he is entitled to. I suggest that British officers shduld be seconded say for five years, with guarantees for their professional prospects and that local or acting rank granted to British personnel by Inspector-General should carry pay, permanent promotion of non-commissioned officers being made in consultation with their British regimental authorities and that officers holding temporary British com missions be provided if they desire it with permanent commissions in South Persia Rifles. Greater freedom is still more indispensible in financial matters. At present observance of the eomplecated minutiae of Indian regulations is exacted and in the absence of a cheap clerical staff British officers have in consequence to neglect training of men for office work. It seems moreover unreasonable to attempt to apply Indian regulations to the very dissimilar conditions in Persia. However, suitable regulations may be for an already organised force, they must be applied with gieat elasticity in the case of one in the process of formation. (Further, it seems useless to inaugurate a system of control which will infallibly be dropped when cost of South Persia Rifles is borne by Persia. In my opinion the only practical course is for the Inspector-General to be authorised to spend up to the limit of his approved budget of three million tomans with power to make transfers as experience and expediency may dictate, with an independent auditor at his headquarters.

Idea is wholly fallacious. Persian feeling is not with us. Even if it were, more appointment of an officer with such a mission would in itself arouse suspicion that we aimed at taking over administration of Southern Persia. South Persia Rifles if they did not actually turn against him, as I believe they would, would not support him but would desert with their arms; and his authority would repose on nothing but some 2,000 Indian troops who have still to earn respect in Southern Persia. For is it not altogether too much to expect that semi- mutinous troops taken over by us a few months ago would have become so loyal as to obey their foreign officers against their own Government ? Mith altered conditions brought about by Russian revolution only possible 'way of making South Persia Rifles a success is to make it a truly Persian force to be used by Persian Government. If we try and impose it on Persia by such means as Government of India suggest, we shall have to send 20,000 men for the purpose. This Sykes thoroughly understands and for this reason I hope there w 7 ill be no question of replacing him on account of Government of India’s dissatisfaction with his work. Grounds of dissatisfaction were not known to me but it is but fair to point out from bis arrival at Shiraz until he received a large addition to his staff this spring, Sykes was set task utterly out of proportion to means with which he was supplied. I am not competent judge of results he has achieved. Military Attache, however, has visited Shiraz and considers they reflect greatest credit on Sykes and his staff. 1 True comprehension of political aspect of this matter is at least as essential to success as organising ability. The latter can be supplied by competent staff at length attached to Sykes. The former he possesses. Addressed to London Foreign Office. 40 Telegram P., dated the 20th June 1917.

As it seems probable that Hussia’s policy towards this country will materially alter at any rate for the immediate future and that we need not apprehend any aggression, it is for Your Lordship’s consideration whether we should not endeavour to regain that confidence in British friendliness that existed before the conclusion of the 1907 Convention. ' It is fully recognised by Persians that that Convention was a defensive measure as far as we were concerned, and that in any coercive measures (and the August Agreement is regarded by them as such) which were subsequently taken by the two rowers our assent has been reluctant. A spontaneous^ offer to tear up the 1907 Convention as far as it concerns Persia and to discuss again provisions of August Agreement would in my opinion go far to regain for us the esteem we have forfeited, would restore us to the position of friendly advisers, and thus afford a chance of persuading Persia to accept foreign help in setting her house in order. If Russia as may he anticipated no longer desires to insist on August Agreement as far as it concerns her, both the increase of Cossack Brigade and joint financial control disappear, and we shall thus find ourselves in the position of having to impose British financial control and the South Persia Rifles on Persia’s acceptance. The signature of the Agreement was brought about by the presence of Russian troops; troops will be no less necessary to enforce its execution. Even if troops are available, His Majesty’s Government could scarcely contemplate a measure which appears to me repugnant to our national sentiment an incompatible with principles we are now fighting for. Persia is moving fast towards anarchy and while I have no sort of belief in her self regener ation, I urge that our better course to save her is to give support to the few native elements that desire a better state of things rather than to alienate them by trying to impose reforms.

These are straws in Governor-GeneraPs opinion showing how the wind blows and he desires me towarn you. I repeated to him your appreciations and assurances and he was much gratified but begged me to assure you of the gravity of the situation and that you should on your side decide up to what point you are prepared to support him and that you should realize that such support would place you in a very difficult position. He says he is always ready to carry out former suggestion of his, viz., an exchange of Governorships with Kerman. If dismissed he would not return to Tehran but probably go to India. He is nervous lest attacks should be made on his family or property in Tehran. He showed me a telegram he was sending to the Minister of the Interior. It began by eulogising my work here since our arrival but stated he had noticed change in my manner towards him during the last few days especially since Sykes' arrival showing that Cabinet's action towards execution in Tehran was not unnoticed by us here and pointing out that they cannot afford to offend us at least as far as Fars is concerned.

It is losing all credit and is openly flouted by press owing to its failure to take any action to suppress political assassination and to its general muddling and weakness. A Cabinet of npich the same complexion as the last may possibly come into office, for there are strong dissensions amongst the democrats. If His Majesty’s Government should decide to adopt change of attitude in Persian affairs, suggested in my telegrams Nos. 212 and 236, efforts of our friends would be encouraged by a Hint to this effect.

I rejoined that it seemed from the peremptory form of their late note that Persian Government believed that question wL settled It was unreasonable for Persia to address us a Note offensive in form and inspired by mistrust and then appeal to our friendship. My wish was to approach this question in the most amicable spirit, but that note stood in way, and I feared that, until an answer was received as to Persia’s attitude towards Sykes’ mission, His Majesty’s Government would decline to bind themselves m the way desired.

Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Shiraz (repeated to Tehran). ^ Your policy arrangements and distribution are entirely under Minister’s direction, under Secretary of State’s most recent orders. Government of India however offer following remarks :—Objects laid down in my telegram. 289-S. of June 15th, 1916, still hold good apparently. Maintenance of order and authority of Persian Government in South Persia is primary object of force. Though it is also intended to balance Russian Cossack force in North in its political effect and by the restoration of our prestige, there is no need for it to be formed on lines of a war division organised to act as such in the field. Number of 10,000 was fixed with reference to objects which force was intend ed to fulfil and to strength of correspond’ng force intended to be maintained by Russia in North Persia not with reference to any field army organisation. Organisation on following Tines would seem suitable :— (1) Division of South Persia into military districts of which four would appear suitable for present, viz., Pars, Gulf Ports, Kerman and Laristan with headquarters at Shiraz, Bushire, Kerman and Bunder Abbas, respectively. (2) Maintenance of one o^more well-equipped movable columns of all arms in each district ready to suppress disorders threatening in any direction. (3) Maintenance of suitable garrisons at large towns and posts on main trade routes. These principles underlie your telegram 1146, dated 3rd December 1916, apparently. This is with reference to your telegrams 625 and 653 of April 6th and llth. 36 No. 5472, dated Simla, the 18th April 1917. From—L ieutenant-Colonel A. H. O.

(б) The acting Serjeant-major will receive extra duty pay at 6a. per diem as acting Serjeant-major with an additional 12a. per diem as gymnastic instructor. (c) All instructors will receive a local allowance of Rs. 30 per mensem plus Rs. 2 per diem in lieu of rations.

If they don’t I shall probably have to try and gain over Sardar which may be partially possible now that he has been frightened. Prince is sulking in retirement but is intriguing with townspeople to telegraph demanding his retention. I think he has committed himself too childishly and obviously in wrecking Finance Department ever to do good work here now and I would recommend his removal if any reasonably promising substitute is forthcoming. He has failed to give assurances to Kurdistani that he will not be assaulted if he goes to Revenue Office and Sardar Nusrat has given only verbal assurances which are less than worthless. In these circumstances I have advised Kurdistani who has now ejected Yahya and closed the office not to attempt to go to office, as no work could be done in present circumstances while any incident would destroy what relics of authority have been left to Finance Department. If the Persian Government want any revenue to be collected here they must stick to their guns and rehabilitate Revenue Department. I have always been told that Yahya, Revenue Assistant, has a democratic record and his removal is, in my opinion, at present juncture highly desirable. Addressed Tehran, 101; repeated Bushire, 105.

Agitation in favour of Prince instigated and paid for by himsfelf and Sardar Nusrat secretly was gaining force and was being taken advantage of by democrats to promote their own objects. I drew the Prince’s attention to what was going on and how his name was being used and he weakly (from his point of view) at once suppressed these demonstrations. He has received a rather (group undecypherable) telegram from the Minister of the Interior for resigning and withdrawing from work, but has I believe repeated his resignation. Some say Prince has the support of the Shah who is glad to be free from his intrigues in Tehran and from the necessity of maintaining him out of the civil list. My telegram 99. Kurdistani has received no orders from new Cabinet and revenue is at a standstill. Sardar Nusrat shows no signs of moving. Deport that Nusrat-ud-Douleh is going to be appointed Governor-General is unfavourably received. There is also rumour of probability of appointment of Sardar Bahadur Bakhtiari. It is very desirable that Cabinet should, without delay, issue definite orders and insist on their being obeyed.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, q 0 (fbe Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Government of India exaggerate in my opinion possible ill results to us of hostile democrat influence in present Cabinet. Though widespread, the anti- British feeling is only an expression of the wish to get rid. of foreign inter ference and in particular against South Persia Rifles as being a new instru ment of such interference. Feeling is unquestionably fomented by agents but there is no real pro-German inclination apparently. While making use of Germans, Persia has no intention of doing anything in return if she can help it. Should Russia conclude separate peace on terms unfavourable to us or should there be a rising in India, then in such or similar circumstances i is ^sible that Persia might declare war against us. Otherwise she will pursue £ N eutrality ” policy of 1915, i.e., official passivity with unofficial assistance ,o eiTerny. Consequences would be political agitation amongst officers and rank and file of South Persia Rifles and encouragement to Soulet and other tribts to make trouble. But so long as our position at Baghdad is secure, I do lot tWnk that oil fields would be attacked or that exceptional measures in Gulf £rts would be necessary. Advance of a Turkish force through country ■would be viewed with dismay. Shuster’s return would in my opinion not he welcomed. His masterful wavs were tolerated, because he was ready to flout two Powers. It is uTkelv moreover that Medjliss would in the circumstances under consider- unlikely moreovex ^ and wit i 10Ut them he would scarcely wish to ation return. o&gt;rant him his old powers 5 This is with reference to your telegram, No. 182.

Minister now wires that Persian Government are negotiating for return of Amir Afshar and that the Russian authorities may give way under pressure from Russian Committees.

I had thought this must have got lost, and as the situation had changed so much since it was written I had decided not to continue the matter. In present circumstances I imagine that probably it will not be possible for you to take action on lines suggested even if you consider it desirable to do so. In the meanwhile Consul, Shiraz (who also only received the despatch two or three weeks ago), has written saying that Qawam is his only standby in Pars, and has done good work in the Baharlu country and has earned money given to him and should be encouraged. Consul adds that he will tackle Qawam about his Shibkuh arrangements on his return. In the circumstances, though I have not such confidence in Qawam as Gough apparently has, I agree that it would be a pity to alienate him at this juncture by pressing the matter of his jurisdiction on the coast, however advisable a change may be from an administrative point of view. Provided, therefore, Qawam’s interview with Gough is satisfactory, and he proves his loyalty by paying in all revenue collected in Shibkuh, Laristan and the Baharlu country, I think the Shibkuh jurisdiction question might be dropped for the present. Shaikh Ibrahim might, however, be allowed to rebuild the destroyed towers in his own Hammadi District, and Shaikh Abdulla should not be reinstated in Chiru at present.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. I regret Government of India should fail to understand my meaning. Speaking only from a Persian stand-point and leaving out all consideration of what Turks can attempt in this direction and of military position in Meso potamia on which matters I have no,knowledge I wished to say that there will be no formidable effort made by any probable Persian Cabinet against us or to assist our enemies. Government of India and I are apparently agreed as to policy to pursue but for different reasons. My wish is to weaken party that calls itself demo crat by removing its only politic capital, viz., hostility to foreign interference, and as Russia is counted out this means British interference. Government of India on the other hand apparently think that we should support “ Democrats ” as possible means of preventing anarchy. This is to credit “ Democrats ' with a desire to bring about improvements in Persia whereas their only object is the acquisition of power for their personal advantage. Democrats in Persia are very much what Committee of Union and Progress was in Turkey. Point (a) in Government of India’s telegram, 730-S. seems to suggest that South Persia Rifles is desired as a military asset. No calculations will be based on such an assumption I trust.

From—His Britannic Majesty^s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. At present constructive policy of reform is scarcely feasible. Persian politics are matter of money-making, and the advocates of reform are too few and ■ too feeble lor us to work through them against vested interests of corruption. Hostile element moreover would misrepresent any endeavour to encourage reiorm as further evidence of interference, and it is this that furnishes them with their war-cry against us. We should thus, I submit, in view of strong opinion of Government of India, confine our endeavour to securing a real benevolent neutrality or something more and to inducing Persian Govern ment to acquiesce in South Persia Rifles under British officers at least till the end of the war. Hence I suggest that we should reopen conversations on August Agreement with the idea of dropping proposed financial control entirely but of coming to terms for maintenance of South Persia Rifles. As regards ^ control it would be unwise in my opinion to press for Yossuk-ed- Dowleh s counter-proposal of control as Medjliss would not give them powers requisite to achieve real reforms and as we could not ensure success of the scheme^ it is better for us not to accept responsibility for it. Regarding South I ersm Rifles question present Cabinet seems to be taking a more reasonable view. I gather that they intend to approach us withqsroposal for immediate formation of single force of gendarmerie for the whole of Persia under neutral officers which would take over South Persia Rifles at end of w . al * 0 ^i° us objection to the proposal is that it implies the formation of a force that could ^ be used against us. In the present condition of Persian iieasury however it is very improbable that any real progress would be made. Moreover we could stipulate for the right to veto the engagement of objection able officers and to demand their dismissal at any time. If His Majesty’s Government consider proposal if made could be entertained, I would suggest following further conditions :— («) that cost of South Persia Rifles should be undertaken by Persian oyernment from date of conclusion of peace until new organ isation is ready to take it over ; (b) that they should pay for material, for arms, equipment, motor cars, &amp;c., and expenditure on barracks; (r) that they should give us prefere nee to rights for any projects that have already been discussed with Persian Government for railway, mining, &amp;c. rCondition (i) is rather make-weight as material will be cheap at the end of wai, j ^d so in a sense is (c) for Persia’s financial position at the end of the war and her need of finding resources to pay for the new gendarmerie by revision of customs tariff will give us requisite opportunity to enforce our Wishes in those respects. Moratorium of May and subsequent instalments have been neither paid nor applied for; this quetion, however, must inevitably come up. Persian Government will probably ask for payment in currency, but this in my opinion should not be conceded until we have acquired proof of Persia’s friendliness. On second thoughts I am averse to scrapping 1907 Convention. To do so would encourage Persia to recommence old game of playing off British against Russian interests and vice versa, and of this there are already signs. On the other hand by maintaining it we can to a certain extent at least prevent Russian agents from lending themselves to such tricks. But we might allow Persia to cancel her recognition of the Convention. Russian assent will presum ably be requisite. By working on such lines we can in my opinion do a good deal to rehabi litate ourselves in Persian opinion. We shall at any rate escape uncongenial and false position into which loyalty to Russia has drawn us. Positive results will otherwise be small. We can check anti-British current, but we cannot reverse it. Our long association with Russia has made us suspect in Persian eyes and added to this Persian opinion inclines to Islamic ally of Germany in present struggle. Persia is too cautious, however, to commit herself either way until issue is or seems to her to be beyond doubt. In any event, however, her effort counts for little and it is worth remembering that fresh German effort will lack great support of gendermerie which did so much for them in many parts of Persia and particularly in Shiraz in which latter direction however I do not see that Germans can have any special objective now.

Teevoe, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Tq The Hon’ble Me. A. H. Geakt, C.S.I., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. At the request of His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a note which he has addressed to the General Staff, South Persia Rifles, on the eubiect of the necessity of importing a considerable proportion of the food-stuffs and grain required by the Corps, in view of the prevailing scarcity in Pars. 2 I anree with Colonel Gough in thinking that, if a general impression is created that the scarcitv of food-stuffs is aggravated by the presence of the British troops, it will have a bad effect, and make the presence of the force even more unpopular with the Persians than it is at present. ' Enclosure. Copy of Confidential Memorandum from Lieutenant-Colonel H. Gough to A. A. Q. M. G , Shiraz, dated the 12th June 1917. I beg to bring to your notice the question of grain prices in Ears and especially in Shiraz, which, unless some action is taken, will undoubtedly cause very great hardship during the coming winter, and very probably disturbances directed against ourselves, as being largely responsible for the scarcity of food-stuffs. Major Manson, D. A. D. S. T., has recently addressed me with a view to preventing the storing in Ambars of grain by Persians, who have the intention of raising prices still higher later on. In this connection he has informed me he has heard H. H the Governor-General is himself buying grain and storing it. As regards this point, His Highness has to lay in supplies for his troops. I may mention that the normal prices of grain at the time of harvest are-^ ***' -• •' * ~~ w Wheat krans 2 per Shiraz man, Barley a 1T0 cents per , Shiraz man, Straw (busa) ♦ 9i 20 per kharwar, while now, while the harvest is being brought in, the prices are wheat 5 krs, and barley 3 krs. per man and straw 60 krs. per kharwar. This of course is very largely due to the facts of the insufficiency of rainfall and the small quantities sown, which again was due to fear of locusts and general insecurity ; but besides these causes of high prices, it is un doubtedly the fact that agents buying for the South Persia Bifles and for the Indian troops have purchased largely locally as well as at a distance.^ The reason for this is probably the unsettled state of the country, but it un doubtedly gives some reason to the cry of the people that the British are raising the prices of food. If we had reduced the country to a peaceful state, so that supplies could come in from a distance, we would have a reasonable answer to make to this complaint, But unfortunately we have not been able to accomplish this up to the present. The purchases for the South Persia Bifles are of course perfectly legitimate, though, considering the paucity of the food-cereals, I consider it would have been wiser (if at all possible) to have purchased at greater distances from the town, as was done last year. But, as regards purchases for Indian troops, I consider, from a political point of view, it is very unwise to purchase wheat and. barley locally, thus depleting the stocks of the country and raising prices here. We have had on©year of hardship, during which, for political reasons, the Government of India has sent flour from India to eke out the local supply for the poor people of Shiraz, while the Home Government have spent about ten thousand pounds sterling in order to reduce the price of bread. This current year conditions will be at least equally hard, and I beg that the question of importing supplies for Indian troops from India and the remainder of supplies for the South Persia Rifles from outside the province of Pars may be considered in all its hearings, at a very early date and with the sympathy the question deserves. So long as Indian troops are in Southern Persia (and political conditions do not appear at present favourable for their early removal) and so long as famine conditions or very great scarcity prevail, I consider it would he very unwise to draw the bulk of supplies locally. I would be glad of an early reply as I propose to telegraph to India on the subject. 85 No. S57-S, dated Bushire, the 1st (received 10th) July 1917.

Gough, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz. With reference to clause 8 of the recent agreement with Soulet, I have the honour to forward, for your information, an extract of the last number fNo. 33, dated ^Ist Shaban (12th June)] of the sc Nida-i-Haq , issued at Kazerun by the notorious Muhammad Reza Dirisi. I understand that this rascal is still in Kazerun, so apparently Soulet has ®*iot seen his way either to arrest Mirza Muhammad Reza Dirisi or even to prevent his remaining in Kazerun, in accordance with the terms of clause 8 referred to above. Whether this is due to the effect produced by the establish ment of a democratic Government at Tehran or to other causes it is impossible tosav. Perhaps you may be able to persuade His Excellency that the removal of Muhammad Reza (and for the matter of that Mirza AJh Kazeruni as well) from Kazerun is essential if he desires to pacify the place. Muham mad Reza is a dangerous firebrand, and not a true democrat 01 i* Ur ‘“M' , . agitator who makes a livelihood out of agitation and is rea ,y , § . services to the highest bidder. As a matter of fact he °nce rfEered t e the Residency but we thought that his writings would not oa ^, m “V t = 3 ’ if he made such a complete volte face, and so would not be worth much to us Resides at that time there seemed to be a prospect that the ^ ern “ d . would take steps to punish the hostile Khans and open J-ip wished to Muhammad Reza certainly thought, they were about to o » jnake frienda while there was yet time.; 4* However as nothing occurred Muhammad Keza took heart and recom menced his pamphleteering, and there is no doubt that he is doing a great deal of harm, by stirring up ill-feeling. The fact that Muhammad Reza is a dangerous man with a natural anti-British bias, is shown by the fact that some years ago the Bombay Police found it necessary, I understand, to get the paper “ Islah ” which he had started in India suppressed and the man himself deported on account of his anti-British writings. If His Excellency the Soulet could be persuaded upon to arrest the man and imprison him it would be a good thing. Or perhaps if he would not himself care to imprison the man he would arrest him and have him handed over to us for detention or internment. A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, and to the Government of India. Sub-enclosure No. 1. Extract from the “ Nida-i-Eaq ’’published at Kazerun by Muhammad Reza Dirisi, the Angloyhobe pamphleteer in German pay, No. 33, dated the 21st Shaban 1335 {=12th June 1917). The Situation in the Capital or a New Revolution. As is frequently reported by newspapers and letters from Tehran, owing io the recent revolution and events in Russia and the complete harmony between the Democratic parties of Persia and Russia, the terrible cloud of darkness that was hanging over Persia has been suddenly transformed into a shining light and with the support of the patriots of Russia, the Democratic party of Persia has become free and come to life again, and is endeavouring to produce order out of the chaos. This state of affairs has not only made itself felt in the Capital, but in all the northern towns, especially Tabriz and Rasht and Qazvin which was the principal place and centre of Russian influence. According to the reports received from the leaders of the parties, all the movements of the Russians seemed to be directed against the British. Ihe Russians have given full authority to the Democratic party of Persia to introduce the necessary civil reforms. They have sent back to Persia Mustaufi- ul-Mamalik, who was more or less imprisoned, and the latter with Mukhbir- us-Saltaneh, Mushir-ud-Douleh, Ihtisiiam-us-Saltaneh and Moatamin-ul-Mulh, who have been always the true well-wishers of the country, have commenced reforming the Government departments. They have formed a committee among themselves to discuss the important affairs of the country, and the first step they took at the instance of the Democratic party was to get an Imperial Proclamation issued by His Imperial Majesty the Shah for elections to be held. Therefore, according to the “ Irshad ”, a copy of which we have received, they proceeded to replace the traitors among the Governors of provinces. It is reported from Shiraz, and also briefly mentioned in the “Irshad ”, that Wothuq-ud-Douleh’s cabinet has been dissolved, and that His Excellency Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik has become Prime Minister. It appears that in consequence of the traitorous acts of the traitors during the crisis of the cabinet, the Democratic party has denounced the Ministers, and killed and arrested some of the traitors. On the one hand, according to news received from Shiraz, Reuter reports that the Crown Prince of Austria has proceeded to Russia to negotiate peace terms, and on the other hand, the “ Irshad ” reports the arrival of a large force of Russian troops at Tabriz. It is also reported from Shiraz that the British troops there 'with the exception of a small number of them have gone to Dehbid and constructed fortifications, and sent large sums of money for the purchase of food-stuffs. When we reflect on all these events we arrive at two conclusions: (1) either Russia had concluded peace or (2) peace negotiations have reached sucha stage that the British Government has ceased to hope for any support from Russia and is trying to secure Southern Persia for themselves. Although politicians mostly believe that after the conclusion of peace Russia will remain neutral, yet in view of the fact that nothing but war will save Russia from the mans she has contracted from England and France it is improbable that the revolutionaries will be satisfied with neutrality rather it is likely they will make war (with England and France). The arrival of so many troops at Tabriz, in spite of all the new friendship she has made with Persia and the absence of any enemy in those parts, and their stopping there without going forward, ai d the fortifying of Dehbid bv the British authorities all these are contrary to the friendly relations between Russia and England. # While the British are using Farman Farma, and the likes of him, and their censorship is controlling all news; on the contrary the Russians have brought back the greatest patriot of Persia, i. e., Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik, to the Capital, and are affording assistance in all manner of ways. It is clear that all plans have been completely reversed, and we may shortly expect very important events in Persia * * * # (Islah.) Sub-enclosure No. 2, A warning from the Democratic-Socialist Party at Tehran, dated the 12th Rajah 1335 (11th May 19 i 7) (received 22nd June 1917). O nation beware the period for electing the Deputies, that is to say those who are to take control of the affairs of the people, is not one which should be passed in negligence and remissness. The present opportunity, which has been afforded Persians, is an epoch-making one, when it is possible for them to prove their capability, and when it is likely that others will declare that they are incompetent. In view of the fact that it is not desirable that we should dilate upon the matter at this juncture it is pointed out that the rules of the Party, which are to be followed by the members, bind and oblige them to be careful that general elections are carried out properly. Therefore the public are warned that with the corrupt Governors in the provinces, and want of attention in placing the elections on a sound basis, they should all expect a dire calamity and know beforehand that the seats in the Parliament will be occupied by such men, who will hurry this country to its downfall precipitately. Therefore it is incumbent upon every patriotic Persian to ask those who are at present holding the reins of the Govern ment to place the elections upon a sound basis from the first, that is to say, “sound elements”, reliable and honest Governors should be appointed in place of corrupt Governors, and then the elections should be commenced. The central office of the Democratic Socialists of Persia urges all its members according to this present warning that they should indirectly do all that lies in their power to discharge both their patriotic duties, and carry out the rules and regulations of their own Association. In conclusion it is pointed out that if anything happens contrary to the above, the present authorites will be held responsible for improper elections. Enclosure No. 2.

Governor-General is telegraphing to Minister of Interior regarding pro posed visit to Soulet. He gives reasons for and against, but his chief desire is to put onus of responsibility on Minister of Interior. Soulet flatly refuses to enter Shiraz and it is putting indignity on Earman Earma to insist on his visiting Soulet miles away, but I believe good will come of visit and I beg you will put pressure on Minister of Interior to send orders to His Highness to pay the call. Addressed Minister, No. 183; repeated Bushire. No. 360-S., dated Bushire, 86 the 1st (received 10th) July 1917 (Confidential). From—M a joe A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Hon’ble Mr. A. H. Grant, C.S.I., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 339-S , dated 18th June 1917, regarding the arrangements made with the Soulet-ud-Douleh by General Sykes and Lieutenant-Colonel Gough for the expulsion of Nasr-i-Divan from Kazerun and the protection of the Kazerun-Shiraz road. In con tinuation of this, I beg to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the marginally-cited telegrams which I have received from Colonel Gough, on the subject. 1. From Consul, Shiraz, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran (rej eated Deputy Resident), No. 179, dated 2sth June 1917. 2 Frrm Deputy Resident, Bushire, to Consul* Shiraz (repeated Hia Majesty’s Minister, Tehran)* No. 121 — 1171, dated 29th June 1917. 3. From Consul, Shiraz, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran (repeated Deputy Resident), No. 180, dated 29th June 1917. 4. From Consul, Shiraz, to Deputy Resident (repeated His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran), No. 182—148, dated 29th June 1917. 2. It is sufficiently evident from these telegrams that Soulet is not carrying out his agreement properly. It appears that Nasr-i-HITan lumself is in Kazerun or quite near it; Muhammad Beza Hirisi “ Islah ” has not been arrested or expelled from Kazerun in accordance with section 8 of the agree ment and is publishing the Nida-i-Haq there; MirzaAli Kazeruni is still in Kazerun with the reinforcements sent by the hostile Khans and Soulet is making no serious attempt to get rid of him. 3. Colonel Gough’s telegram 180 shows that Soulet is still at his old game (for which he is| notorious even in a country where it is the general rule) of trying to keep in with both sides. Apparently he is now about to resume the role of Patriot and “democrat”, which ne adopted soon after the Shiraz colony was captured, and dropped again (to a great extent) in May 1916 when he saw our star was again in the ascendant. He did not, however, totally discontinue dallying with the other side, as he has ail along been in correspond ence with the hostile Khans, and assisted the German prisoners from Kerman, when they came to Ears and helped them to get to Ahram, 4. In the circumstances the agreement seems a dead letter, and, in my humble opinion, it is waste of money to subsidise SouJet. His principal object is to get the greater part of the Bushire-Shiraz road into his power, so as to be able to levy “ Bahdari ” tolls and blackmail on it. In this lie has succeeded as is shown in Colonel Gough’s telegram 179 (enclosure 1), and also by the state ment of a muleteer who arrived a few days ago in Bushire. The latter stated that even though he was armed with a pass signed by Soulet himself, he was forced to pay 3 Krans per mule at every stage on the road down except Khisht which is not at present under Soulet or the hostile Khans. 5. It will he seen from the above that my opinion of Soulet coincides with that expressed by the Earman Earma, and quoted by Colonel Gough in the last paragraph of his telegram No. 180 (enclosure 3). In regard tQ a—Colonel Gougli’s remarks in the penultimate paragraph of the Same telegram regarding Soulet’s treatment o£ Captain Geard, I do not think it is a matter for surprise, and in fact I anticipated that he would not agree to the presence xr a ™ H 1S cam P at (vide paragraph 3 of my letter No. 148-S., dated 5th March 1917). He would naturally regard a Political °^ C f on hls P ro ^dmgs, and as a slight handicap in his intrigues and double dealings. &amp; Enclosure No. 1.

Hoad to Dash tar jin under dual control according to agreement. Reports vary as to whereabouts of Nasr-i- Divan. Soulet assures me he is not and has not been in Razerun whilst a native of that town told me he had seen Nasr-i-Divan enter the town bv night. There have not been any robbers on the road lately, but Soulet’s men were taking “ Rahdaii”. I arranged with Soulet to pay Tumans $00 amount more to make up for this and he has given orders it is to (cease). Soulet promised he would come to a garden near Shiraz where he would see Governor-General. This I consider (if it comes off) a very important step in the right direction. I promised Soulet if the agreement works, a handsome present for himself and if all ends well I think Tumans 10,000 or 15,000 would not be (exces sive?).

Muhammad Reza Dirisi is now publishing his pamphlet Nida-i-Haq at Kazerum No. 33, dated 12th June, is very virulent. Perhaps you have seen a copy. After speaking of the good effect of the Russian Revolution, the order for elections and appointment of new patriotic Government, he goes on to say reactionary Governors are being dismissed, and that Russia has either made separate peace or negotiations have gone so far that we have no further hope from Russia and intend to secure South Persia for ourselves. As proof of this he instances Sykes having sent nearly all British troops from Shiraz to Dehbid where they are forty lying themselves (to resist Russians coming from Tabriz) ! If Soulet could be prevailed upon to get hold of this man in accordance with his agreement, it would be a good thing as his propaganda is doing much harm.

Governor-General and Qawam showed me last night a document which they told me Soulet sent in for their signature if they agreed to act with him.llilii ;/! : h ! i i!’ Principal article in document was that all three (Soulet would sign after the other two) agreed that Indian troops should be sent away. ^ Oi course Soulet did not put his signature to paper which was in the handwriting of Mirza Haji Ahmad Khan which one Lari (subject ?) brought by Muntasnor-ul-Mulk, brother-in-law of Qawam. Both these (are) have lately been in Soulet’s camp trying to arrange meeting between Governor-General and Soulet and former is still there. Governor-General says this move has been made by Soulet to place himself on good footing with democrats. If the Governor-General and Qawam sign they go against us while if not they can be denounced as against their country while Soulet would he in position of leader of popular party. I have heard Soulet is trying hard consolidate his positiou while still keeping in w T ith us and accepting our money, so that in the event of war ending favourably for Germans he would still be in good position while in case we win he is still with us. Whole essence of agreement made with Soulet was that Kazerun and road should be kept in good order pending the taking over of that place by South Persia Bifles in the autumn and whether Soulet carries out details or not provided essential is maintained I presume we must continue to pay him according to agreement and rest satisfied. His attitude to me (personally ?) (is ?) one of great friendliness but be resented Geard’s presence in camp and was very unpleasant to him although he had assured me he would be very glad to see him. Parraan Parma wishes me to tell you that Soulet is not and will not be friendly, but he will do his best to carry out as we advised. Addressed Minister, No. 180; repeated Bushire. Enclosure No. 4.

In continuation of my letter No. C.-22, dated the 11th May last, I have the honour to report the measures taken for the disposal of the three prisoners therein mentioned. 2. The first German messenger, Abdul Husain, was sent back to Herat; a letter being written to his employer, Haji Ghulam Husain, thanking him for assistance given to us. 3. Ahmad Barbari, the second messenger, has been sent to His Majesty's Consul in Sistan for detention, and Abdul Wahab, the German secret Agent, was delivered to the Governor-General here by whom he has been, despatched to Birjand, there to be retained by the local authorities until the close of the war, unless they, in consultation with His Majesty’s Consular representatives, decide upon a better course of dealing with him. tr4. Early action was necessary in regard to these two men, particularly the latter, Abdul Wahab. In consequence of the fall of the Cabinet in Tehran and an accompanying recrudescence of democratic influence both there and in Meshed, it was represented to me by the local Karguzar, as well as by the Governor-General himself, that action should be taken at once, as they feared the receipt of orders at any moment for the liberation of all such political prisoners. The measures above described having been concerted in agreement with the Karguzar were carried out, and they have been approved by His Majesty’s Minister with whom the preliminary details had been arranged. 5. The attitude both of His Excellency the Governor-General and, more particularly, of the Karguzar, has been very satisfactory in this matter. It is much to be hoped that the change of Government will not cause the recall of the latter from office* 88 No. 366-S., dated Bushire, the 9th (received 17th) July 1917.

Qawam has collected his revenues—though he remitted some on account of scarcity—and tells me he is ready to pay his own revenue to Persian Government.

Orders have recently come from the Persian Government that Sardar Nusrat and Kurdistani should immediately proceed to the capital in order that the matter in dispute may there be discussed and settled. When Governor-General enquired what were my views, I strongly advised compliance with the order. Kurdistani means to start at once, but Sardar Nusrat is making excuses for delay; I fancy he will endeavour to avoid going at all. Moreover, the Governor-General is secretly unwilling or afraid to let him away. It is my opinion that Persian Government should be encouraged to stand firm in this matter of requiring presence of Sardar Nusrat at Tehran. It would be an excellent thing for us and a profitable venture for themselves if the Persian Government were to summon Adl-us-Sultan to Tehran also. The Adi is at least as responsible as Sardar for all this trouble : he has also to render an account of the German money he stole. There is no doubt whatever that he knew all about the escape of the Sirjan prisoners, though I am unable to bring him to book in a direct manner as I cannot produce formal proof of his complicity.

No. 25—1092, dated Bushire, the 28th May 1917. From—M ajor A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Acting Consul-General, Bushire, To— Sir Charles Marling, K.C.M.G., C.B, His Britannic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, Tehran. Since the reopening of the land-route from Bushire to Borasjun and Firuzabad in August 1916, His Excellency Darya Begi has maintained Persian inspection officials, with a staff at three posts in the line which protects the Bushire peninsula from attack. Arrivals and departures from and to tae interior, whether of caravans or tribesmen coming in to market or tor other purposes, are only permitted by those three harriers, between sunrise and sunset, and all armed men are obliged to deposit their arms and ammunition, before crossing the harriers, with the Persian Inspector, who gives t em tickets, in exchange after the manner of a cloakroom. This practice as ensured the whole peninsula being free of all armed men save British Indian soldiers, and the Governor’s own forces, an important matter, considering t a as many as 240 rifles have sometimes been so deposited in a single day.3 ii P U J- lD /P 6 ^ 0 ^ °f 9 montlis, it may be assumed that nearly all the able-bodied male inhabitants of villages of Tangistan, Chahkutah, &amp;c., within a radius of 40 miles have come in to market at least once, with the exception of the rebel khans, their families, and a certain number of Raises, and notori ous scoundrels. A table has been drawn up from the registers of names of tufangchis depositing rifles at the Inspection post for these 9 months, and I now have the honour to forward this to you, thinking that it will give you reliable inform ation as to the number of armed men in Tangistan and Chahkutah. Each man’s name has only been included once in these lists. The majority of Borasjun villages trade via Shief and the searoute with Bushire, and do not biing aims into Bushire at all i this is the reason why only some 8 Borasiun villages figure on the list, and so few men from Borasfun itself. The results obtained from the table attached may be compared with the summary of the estimate of the late Haider Khan, Tangistani, and his son, enclosed in my despatch to you, No. 25—207-C. of 19th June 1916, of which, for convenience of reference, i attach a printed copy. Many exaggerated reports have, I fear, reached His Majesty’s Government ' and military authorities of the numbers and fighting strength of the Tangis tani, Cbahkutahi tribesmen, etc.: the rebel and hostile Khans have been in consequence considered far harder a problem to tackle than they really are. I venture to think that this list shows that the Darya Begi, with the loan of 2 or 3 guns, would have had no difficulty in dealing with these hostile Khans, and His Excellency, of course, has constantly expressed this opinion. It will be seen that the interior villages of Tangistan possess according to this list some 750 rifles (allowing for a few of these weapons to have been borrowed from their owners by those who do not possess rifles). Of these some 270 are Mauser magazine rifles, and it is notorious that Mauser ammunition is extremely scarce : some 400 rifles take ’SOS (British) ammunition, but the majority of these are of an old pattern, not magazine rifles, and the Inspector states that bandoliers rarely contain more than 15 to 20 rounds. Shaikh Hussain Chahkutahi’s district owns some 200 rifles, of which 100 take *303 ammunition and 65 are,, Mausers. Those villages of the Borasjun district, which border on Tangistan, the Shahi road and Chahkutah, and use the land-route number some 80 rifles taking *303 ammunition and 60 Mauser weapons. A further point needs to be borne in mind, /Az., that several of the larger villages of Tangistan mentioned in these lists, e.g-, Qabakulaki, Suraki, Gulaki Abad, Anbarak are either altogether, or partly hostile to Z dr Khidar, and ready to rise against him, should any Government force appear on the scene: this in itself reduces the number of rifles, likely to oppose any advance to a very few hundred. Owing to the scarcity of ammunition (the Khans alone having any stocks which thev keep for their personal retainers), the values of rifles, especially Mauser weapons, has fallen very low. Consequently one of the projects in connection with the recently proposed expedition by the Darya Begi was t le disarmament of the Tangistan and Borasjun villagers and tribesmen, to w 10 m some small compensation would have been given to make the measure more acceptable. This would have finally crushed the power of the Khans and? tribesmen of the Bushire Hinterland, and rendered them incapable 0 *1 y lr T5 f the local Government either by holding up the “ Shahi road, ” or by refusing to pay revenue.5 34 No. C.-22, dated Meshed, the Ilth May (received 8th June) 1917 (Confidential). From-W RN ANT.CoLON E L W. G. Grey, His Britannic Majesty's Consul- General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan, To—-The Hon'ble Mr A H. Grant, C.S.I., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. In continuation of my telegram No. 33-C., dated 5th May 1917, I have the honour to submit the following report in connection with the German messengers and their secret agent in Meshed who have recently been captured. The two letters carried by one of the messengers, and a statement made by Abd-ul-Wahab, the agent referred to, forms enclosures (i) and (ii) to this despatch. 2. As mentioned in my diary No. 18, Saiyid Husain bin Saiyid Bahira» the first messenger, was arrested at Karez and sent in to Meshed by our agent there. He was in the employ of Haji Ghulam Husain, the Herat chemist, spoken of in my letter to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, a copy of which was sent to you with my letter No. C.-12, dated 22nd March last, and had been procured by him for this mission at the request of Wagner’s servants. Whether the Haji intended to help the German party or to help us according to his promise, or both, is doubtful; but it is certain that from personal experience and knowledge of the fate which befell Ahmad Barbari on his last venture he must have been perfectly well assured that Baiyid Husain’s chances of escaping detection on the Karez route were very small, and that travelling without a passport would not help him. It is also significant that Saiyid Hussain declined to travel with Ahmad Barbari, the second messenger. 3. Saiyid Husain on arrival here handed over £ 10 in gold which had been entrusted to him by the German party for delivery to the agent Abd-ul-Wahab to whom Ahmad Barbari, the second messenger, was to introduce him; and informed us of the approximate date and hour at which he was to meet Ahmad, who was coming by another route, in the Meshed Shrine. Arrangements were made to arrest Ahmad, and this was done with out difficulty at the proposed rendezvous. He denied having brought letters, but admitted having met Abd-ul-Wahab, the man to whom he was to intro duce Saiyid Husain, earlier in the day. Abd-ul-Wahab was duly arrested in the caravanserai indicated by Ahmad as his residence and brought to this office where his effects were examined. 4. Among them letter No. 1 was found. Abd-ul-Wahab at first denied that any other had been given to him, but after some persuasion admitted that a second letter from the same writer had been handed over by Ahmad Barbari which he had concealed in the flooring of his room at the caravanserai. This having been unearthed proved to be the attached letter No. 2 ; and the reason for particular care having been shewn in guarding it, with that for the despatch ot cash for Abd-ul-Wahab, are eTident from its contents. I he arrest of Ahmad Barbari and Abd-ul-Wahab, and the discovery of the letters, reflect credit upon Jamadar Sharbat Ali Khan and Barash Murad Ah, the assistants of Lieutenant-Colonel Redl, General Staff Officer, Intelligence, who were charged with these duties. 5. Ahmad Barhari appears on this occasion to have travelled by rail via Merv and Kahka, and thence to Meshed on foot; and his 0l!0U P' e about the same time as that of Saiyid Husain / h ®f c 1 ‘ e0 ^ 0U t t h e e - It was not expected by us for several reasons, not the least of which was fni - lnrA hie Hof mission, that Ahmad would return to Herat, and it came a m prise o fl nd that he had done so. He did not give Wagner any m orm- a sm prise to nna • bl se to him and would scarcely be able to do ation that could be ot appreciate use uu . remaining so now, but I think that he had better be sent to ^ tbe period of the war, and will refer this question to you by telegraph.■I ' ji- ' , ■ i i .

Some two years ago I was serving at Tun as a Revenue Sowar, and was directed to proceed to Dakuk on duty. En route I passed through the village of Pathabad where I met a party of Germans and their adherents composed as under:— ' Hentig, known as the “ Wa^ir’s son ”, A German, known as Rais, Wagner, later known as Abd«ur-Rahman, Roghal, Vogt, A German (name unknown to me) who died on the way to Kabul, Jamsbid, a resident of Talaghun near Tehran, employed as peskkbidmat and also as sowar, Nasrulla, of Tehran, similarly employed, Abbas Ali, a groom, Agha Karim, a groom, Asghar, Hamadani, groom of Hentig,Haji Karam, an Arab, Nur Muhammad, with about 20 Persian sowars, all of whom deserted at one time or another before we crossed the Afghan frontier. I joined myself to them, and we came first to Herat remaining there for a fortnight, and then proceeded to Kabul where we stayed for about eio-ht months. The total G.erman party at Kabul at this time divided itself inro •four parts. The first, which comprised Vogt, Mahendra Pertab, MauM Barkat-ullah, Kazim Beg, and two Persians with whom I was not acquainted, remained in Kabul. The second party consisting of Hentig, Koghal, two Afridis, and the Persian Jamshid stayed behind at Punjsher: and the third and fourth sections with whom were Niedermayer, Wagner, three or four Austrians, four Persians including myself, proceeded in the direction of Mazar-i- gharif. One night, when we had reached Sar-i-Pul, I was told that I might return to Persia if I wished, and I elected to do so, accompanied by Miiza Husain, a Persian Turk of Azarbaijan, and a Turkoman guide whom we called Dughan. After ten or twelve days travelling by a route which was strange to me we reached Persian territory, and Mirza Husain left me, saying that he had been told to go to Kuchan. After a day or two in Meshed I went to Turshiz, and a month or so later to my home in Piruzabad near Tabaz. Pive months passed during which time I visited Turbat-i-Haidari, and I then returned to Meshed and put up in the caravanserai in which I have now been arrested. I have been here for about two months. I met Ahmad Barbari in the shrine after he had been released from confinement here about a month ago. He told me that he was going back to Herat, and asked me to come with him. I replied that I had no money, and wrote a letter asking for some which he undertook to deliver for me. My name while with the Germans was Ghulam Husain, that of Mirza Husain was Ali Akbar: this latter is his real name. I do not know where he is now, neither have I any idea who the respectable person ” is to whom reference is made in one of the letters sent to me. 35 No. 317-S., dated Bushire, the 3rd (received 11th) June 1917.

I hope if time permits to be able to add to this letter before it is posted a memorandum Bivins' a few of the principal incidents in his career. Before the war he was a common (or perhaps uncommon would describe the degree of his success better) swindler and fraudulent bankrupt ‘‘Constitutionalist (Persian stvle) and “Democrat” (Persian style). In these varied capacities he has for many years given this Residency endless trouble. Since the war he has bee™ a ibid pro-German of the most active and useful description who w ith the notorious Muhammad Rez.a Dinsi “ Tslah’ has been Wassmuss’ right hand man. I consider him just as dangerous a man as Is ah in a different way. “ Islah” is a Pamphleteer, and a very good one, while Mirza Ali is a veiy clever agitator and intriguer. In the circumstances, I would suggest that it would be advisable to warn the Soulet about the man, and if possible get him to agree to treat him m the same way as Islah”, and expel him from Kazerun. INeedless to Say, I think Haii Khan and his tufangchis should be expelled too. In anv case I hope Soulet will not accept Mirza Ali Kazeruni or any one else as ‘the representative of the Dashtistani Khans for purposes of nego- tiation As I have mentioned on more than one occasion, it is not advmb e that Soulet should mix himself up in Dashtistan affairs and perhaps constitute himself a sort of protector of the hostile Khans.

Copy of Mirza Ali Kazeruni's letter, dated 6th Shaaban (28th May 1917) to his son Abdur Rahman at Borasjun. Received at Borasjun on the 7th Shaaban (29th May 1917) and at Bushire 31st May 1917. (jV. B .—Mirza Ali Kazeruni had gone with the tufangehis sent by the rebel Khans of Dashtistan to assist Nasr-i-Divan).) We arrived at Kazerun on the night of the 5th instant (evening of the 26th May 1917). All my companions are safe and although the difficulties on the road were nerve4iring, yet praise he to God, they were happily sur mounted. % There is no fresh news at Kazerun. The people are happy and safe. Outward appearances all show that the Sardar Ashair not only entertains no sinister designs (against Kazerun), hut is giving the utmost assistance. It is hoped that arrangements will be made for Zargham Islam Nasr-i-Divan) to come back to Kazerun. Muhammad Quli Khan, who was at Qalah-i-Tul-i-Guak, and intended to make an attack, has had to come to Kazerun, and will not go back. Shapur will thus be in the undisputable occupation of Nasr-i-Divan. 1 wrote a letter to Sardar Ashair last night reporting my arrival and that of the tufangchis and asking for permission to pay him a visit, if he still thought it necessary for the (Khans’) representatives to see him. I requested him to make arrangements for Nasr-i-Divan to return to Kazerun. Copies of telegraphic circulars from His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Prime Minister about the election of deputies and representatives fiom the people have been received from Shiraz. It is urged that the representatives of the people must be elected in 10 days’ time. I will send you a copy of the cir culars. It is not known what changes have taken place that orders are issued for the election of the representatives of the people at such a time. Be it as it may, this circumstance foretells the independence of Persia and of course the assembling of the deputies will put an end to the illegal inter- ference of the foreigners, and we must be very glad for this good news which is a cause of hopefulness. A letter has come from Shiraz ; I will send a copy of it to-morrow. I shall also send you a copy of the answer to the letter to Sardar.

From- rroiu—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Assassination occurred on June 7th of most important and respected ecclesiastic of Tehran. Crime is admittedly political with two-fold object of securing return of democrat deputies and terrorizing our friends.^ A warm supporter of Prime Minister, he was using his great influence to bring about selection of moderate and intelligent deputies at approaching elections and was therefore credited with being pro-British. The press and the ecclesiastical influences hostile to democrats are now crushed. Sipah Salar has fled and there is talk of others following his example. Policy of democrats is briefly this :— All politics of democrats pivot on relations of two neighbouring Powers. Russia is for time paralysed and her representative is even showing some nerfunctory sympathy with the democrats. Recognising that British in fluence is only'support of Moderates opposed to them, the democrats are now holdin°'us up as the oppressor from whose yoke they will free Persia and whose friends must be removed as traitors to their country. It is clear from these murders that attack on us will be pushed home—m connection with our work in South Persia more particularly. New Cabinet is nothing but a friendly fagade (see my telegram No. 196) to shield attack. Prime Minister, whom I saw yesterday, knew nothing of situation or of circumstances in which he came into office; he was not even aware that Sykes had been recognised as working on peiiail of Persian Government; he could ftnot even tell me his programme, and when I asked for a promise that Parra an Parma would be supported he would not go further than say vaguely that there was no intention of interfering with Farman Earma. J ° J Russian Minister is, I believe, returning very soon much will depend on his attitude. But if he has instructions to show sympathy with Democrats, they will be so encouraged that it will be necessary for us to reconsider our immediate policy. This is with reference to my telegram 184.

Soulat-ud-Doulah’s reply to Khwaja Abdullah was this that he had no sanction from the Government to grant a respite and that Khwaja Abdullah must leave Kazerun at once. Khwaia Abdullah replied that he would evacuate Kazerun, and was prepared to fight. At present Khwaja Abdullah has begun to make sangars round Kazerun, and sent and brought back to Kazerun all the tufangchia who were at Changak. At present they are ready to resist. 3 All the people in Kazerun have removed their possessions, some of them are burying them in Kazerun itself: while others are fleeing from Kazerun secretly at night. Meshedi Muhammad Ibrahim, [Farrashbashi of Khwaja Abdullah, is still wounded, and has not recovered. 4. The number of Kazerun tufangohis is as follows:— 150 tufangchis, who are fairly well versed in shooting. 350 tufangchis, who have not the slightest idea how to shoot. The total number of Khwaja Abdullah’s men is some 500. The “ Captain ” and Hai Malcolm are at Chahartak with Soulat-ud- Doulnh. A reliable man, who knows something of what is going on, and whom I had sent to Soulat’s camp, and who thence went to Kazerun, has brought back these items of information. He returned to-day. 5. Yesterday Mirza Muhammad Khan sent sowars round to his villages, and ordered each village to supply five tufangehis, to be sent to assist Khwaja Abdullah at Kazerun. The Kadkhudas replied that they had no men to send to Kazerun. On the 18th Mirza Muhammad Khan sent Shaikh Muhammad Hussain (Mulla of Borasjun) to Shaikh Hussain and Zair Khidar to ask them to send men to assist Khawaja Abdullah. So far it is uncertain whether they will send him assistance or not. 6. Skirmishing is still going on as before at nights between Borasjun and Shabankareh. There is no further news from Kamarij and Khisht. But grave estrangement has arisen between Mirza Muhammad Khan and Nur Muhammad Khan, and they have no communication with each other. It is arranged that Sheikh Muhammad Hussain, after seeing Zair Khidar and Shaikh Hussain, shall go on to Dashti, to get assistance from Dashti for Khwaja Abdullah.

TherG is gi owing ngit^tion in fnvour of immediatG election. In absencG c»f support from Suah Cabinet are powerless to resist though persuaded that Medjliss can only result in anarchy. Except Prime Minister and one or two other Ministers everyone from His Imperial Majesty downwards is at present seeking to evade responsibility of taking any decision on question of Medjliss and election. These questions were referred by the Shah to a small committee of moderate but timid men who in turn referred it to larger committee which now recommends reference to those ^-deputies of former Parliaments who are at present in Tehran. This means reference to professional politicians who form bulk of pro-German democrat party and their decision is a foregone conclusion. Cabinet will be forced to resign and will be succeeded probably by a Mustauh-ul-Mamalik combination such as produced the chaos of autumn 1915. Pro-German leaders who fled with German Minister in November 1915 will return and their intrigues will cause us great embarrassment in Southern Persia. Eoregoing represents views of Prime Minster, and I entirely concur in them. In order to check agitation it is in his opinion of first importance that Russia should take up decided attitude. He recognises that they cannot oppose convening of Medjliss but suggests that they can quite well declare they cannot tolerate return of officials and deputies who supported German propaganda to public life He thinks this would act as a strong check, as real object of agitation is of course merely to upset Cabinet. As in present circumstances Russian influence “ does not exist” he strongly urges immediate return of Russian Minister with instructions in this or a similar sense. Prime Minister begs that these views may not be quoted as coming from him. I am doing what I can to prevent any decision being taken before Provisional Government declares itself, but if there is likely to be any delay 1 hope Russian Minister will return at once; His presence will go a long way to steady opinion here.

My telegram No. 93 to Trevor informing him that it was the intention of South Persia Rifles to take over Kazerun was based on a misapprehension. Before arrival of Sykes’ staff, it was our intention to occupy Kazerun and keep 400 South Persia Rifles there until Soulet had settled affairs and expelled Nasr-i-Divan. At the meeting on April 14th referred to in Sykos’ telegram decision was arrived at to undertake no enterprise of adventurous nature and not to attack Kazerun. I did not understand at thnt time this likewise put an end to idea of taking over a pacified Kazerun from Soulet and idea still remained that Kazerun would be taken over as soon as possible. Hence my mistake which I regret. Had I at that time understood full, nature of policy laid down, it is probable I should not have sent Bristow to Soulet since latter’s mission has lost most of its value. Soulet is now approaching Kazerun. I am not sure if Bristow has joined him, hut he should have done so by now. Kashkulies under the brother of Mahomet Ali Khan have occupied Mian Kutal and have asked South Persia Rifles to take over from them Sar-i-Chang and have key of position beyond Dashti Arjan. ^ South Persia Rifles are not taking post now, but Governor-General is sending tufangchis to take it as Kashkulis cannot hold it for any length of time.

Khan as the most important Lui- Chief, who was supposed to be friendly to tho Russians, I should get the Lurs as a whole to carry on a partisan war fare against the Turks’ Line of Communications, especially in the event oi a retreat from Hamadan. I left Kazvin on the 31st August, and after seeing His Majesty s Minister in Tehran, proceeded with Mr. Aloir, British Vice-Consul in Aracj, to had, which was reached on the 4th September. Mirza Ah Akbar, B.itish Agent at Burujird. who was at Tehran, promised to follow me by the next mail cart, but though several times summoned through His ajes y . persistently refused to come. I have consequen y sugge. , 5 j Minister that this individual should not again be en ^. s ^ nn ^ A o'Ani' at Ruruiird owing to the state of the country it was imp sible for me personally to visit the Lur Chiefs, this failure of our Burujrrd Agent'i f ♦ 1 f'i ■, ; I B ■ \i I i i -T I r * tJ*A. caused serious difficulty at the outset as it was impossible to find any one in Sultanabad either qualified or willing to act as intermediary with Nazar Ali Khan. Kecourse had consequently to be had to the unsatisfactory means of letters sent by Karsids, In the beginning of September, the position locally oecassioned some anxiety. There were no Russian troops at Sultanabad while Doulatabaa and XMzabad were in the hands of the enemy, and the Turks were carrying on ^ vigorous propaganda with the surrounding tribes. On my representing the vrr-A&lt; facts, a small force was sent to Saruk on the Hamadan road and subsequently to Sultanabad. My first efforts were directed towards getting into communication with Nazar Ali Khan, but it was not till the 21st September that I received a reply from him that he was sending an Agent to meet me at Zanganeh near Doulatabad. This seems however to have been a trap. The Russians sent a small force at that time to seize Doulatabad, which 1 accom- * panied, passing through the village which was the rendezvous. The Russian attempt was unsuccessful and I passed through the village again with the retiring troops, but nothing could be heard of the Agent and it became known shortly after that Nazar Ali Khan had definitely taken service with the enemy. I next started communications with Ali Mardan Khan, the Bairanawand Chief. In these use was made of the services of the Saham*u-Sultan, a wealthy landowner in the country between Sultanabad and Doulatabad, and Rais- i-Fauj-i-Kaszaz in the former place. This individual who was well disposed towards us, had connection with the Lurs through the Samsan-u-Mamulik and Khusrau Khan, Dehkhurdi. The delays however which occured in the receipt of replies and the general attitude of procrastination met with, indicated that so long as the Russians were unable to take Doulatabad and Burujird, which are considered to be the keys to the situation in this area, and they remnined on the defensive, little active help could be expected from any of these people. Apart from the fact already alluded to that the Turks were using all possible means to enlist the Lur tribes on their side, a further reason for the latter’s rather equivocal attitude was to be found in the # general state of anarchy prevailing in the Araq, Malayan and Japalak provinces; for raiding defenceless villages was obviously more in accordance with Lur tastes and at the same time more lucrative than service with the Russians with its risks and inconveniences. A meeting was eventually fixed to take place at Tuleh, with Ali Mardan Khan, who had in the meantime obtained a promise of support from Karim Khan, Haji Ali Khan, and Sher Mohammed Khan, Sag wands. The object of the meeting, as arranged with Colonel Stopchansky then commanding in the Sultanabad area, was, inter alia, to renew an agreement made by the Russians with certain Lur Chiefs before the evacuation of Hamadan. The details of the subsidies then arranged were not in possession of the Russians, but at Colonel Stopchansky’s suggestion, I got them from the Rukn-u-Douieh, Governor of Luristan. They were as follows :— Nazar Ali Khan, Sardar Akram Mehr Ali Khan, Hassanzwand, Sardar Amjad Ghulam Ali Khan, Nasrat-ul-Sultan, Gudarzi Mirza Rahim Khan, Moin-u-Suitana and Khans of Khurramabad ••• ••• Ali Mardan Khan, Amiri Mafakham, Bairanawand Ghulam Hussain Khan, Sardar Ashraf Sheikh Ali Khan, Sardar-i-Ashir, Bairanawand, and Mirza Khan Bairanawand. Ts. 1,000 600 600 1,000 2,000 1,000 1,000Klmsrau Ivhaii, Dehkhurdi Salar Akram and Salar-ul-Sultan, Yar Abmadi Akbar Khan, Qaid Kahmat ... Mohsin Khan, Amir Khan, Mir AH Khan, Razani Ts. 600 500 200 200 Total ... 8,500 These subsidies were, it seems, to be paid by tbe Persian Government, through the Revenue Department and were nominally for the policiun 1 and protection of roads in Luristan. ° The Russians attacked and took Doulatahad on the 25th September and the venue of the meeting was changed to that place. Unfortunately the day previous to that on which Ali Mardan Khan and his sowars were to arrive, the Russians were turned out of Doulatabad and had to make a hurried retreat to Sultanabad and the position locally became worse than before. r J he “young” Bakhtiari Khans wdio were acting in conjunction with the rebels turned the Deputy Governor out of Japalak early in October and began extorting revenue. Those principally concerned were Salar-u-Akram, son of the llkhani (subsequently recalled by his father), Sikandar Khan, Salar-i- Masud, and Bahadur-u-Sultaneh. Amir-i-Mufakham remained at Areh and did not himself join the gathering that from this time till the close of the year was engaged in hostilities against the Russians, but documentary evidence exists to show that he encouraged the movement and his sowars actually joined the rebel, forces that threatened Sultanabad. Sardar-i-Muazzam with his personal retainers joined the enemy at Doulatabad. The negotiation with Ali JMardan Khan resulted in his keeping aloof from this movement. Appointments were at this time made by the Nizam-u-Sultaneh in the name of the Snak to the Governorships of Araq and Luristan, Sardar Muqtadir being selected for the former, Sardar Mohi for the latter. The last named, supported bv Nazar Ali Khan and his sowars, entered Burujird about the 11th October, tlu? Rukn-u-Douleb being forced to leave. Simultaneously with this j enemy activity, the Russian troops in the Sultanabad neighbourhood were reduced to 330 Cossacks with 2 machine guns. The situation being as shown, it seemed essential, in order to prevent the hostile tribal movement assuming a much more widespread and serious character, to enter into relations with the Chahar Lang Chiefs and Sardar Hasmat of Kemareh and if necessary to offer them considerable inducements to iret them to range themselves on our side. This course was approved by General Baratoff, and after obtaining the sanction of His Majesty’s Minister, I proceeded to the Chahar Lan^l country accompanied by Air. Moir and Archimandrite Khoren. I make mention here of two facts which, apart from the general causes which seem to have led the Persian people as a “whole to a pro-German attitude, have locally operated to make the task of enlisting the services of tribal leaders more difficult than it need have been. The most important of these is the extremely bad behaviour of the Russian soldiers towards the inhabitants which can hardly be condemned in sufficiently strong language, combined with non- pavment, or insufficient payment, for supplies. Representations mace ere by*Mr. Moir and myself and through Mr. Durie at Headquarters have been received in good part, but up to the present have been quite oarren o resu s.^ The second is the presence at Sultanabad of an Armenian priest (Aichi mandrite Khoren) who has been actieg for the Russians in the capaci y o Political and Supply officer and who is them general medium for correspond- ence with the people of the country. This individual is a Russiansu jec owner of considerable properties in Araq where bis raetho s an s l0n o doubt hereditary—anti-Muhammadan bias has for years caused him to be an object of dislike and suspicion. Lately he has been sc leming o presence of Russian troops for his personal aggrandisemen , an.SMi doubt also that he lias been secretly working to defeat tbe object of a good understanding with local chiefs. I recently had opportunity to represent privately to M. Minorski of the Russian Legation how much more satisfactory it would be if the Russians had a Consul to act as Political Officer with their troops, but it seems they have at present no one to spare In the mean time the Archimandrite’s local knowledge renders him indispensable to the Officer Commanding in Araq. Meetings were held with Khojabr-u-Sultaneh, his cousins Salar Muqtadir and Salar-i-Muzaffar, and Haji Mahoramed Raza, Japalaki, at Kagan and Imamzada Kazirn from 22nd to 25th October, and agreement was arrived at. As it was not completed, I only give the bare outlines which were as under : — I ; / The Chahar Lang Khans—(1) to unite, (2) to deny road to hostile parties, (3) to seize enemy agents, (4) supply sowars, for service with Russian troops. The British Government-(1) to extend to Khans special recognition and good offices with Persian Government, (2) in the event of the enemy entering their country to secure for the Khans compensation for damage. I: The advantages of such an agreement, concluded with Russian approval, were, as they appeared to me, that besides securing so far as might be possible the immediate object in view, it would hereafter give us a voice, which we do not at prelit possess, in matters connected with this branch of the Bakhtiari. Tiie Chahnr Lan^ country, it may be observed, lies within the Russian sphere. f III i i A telegram from His Majesty’s Minister, however, reached me just as tbe document was about to be signed to the effect that General Bara toff did not wish any agreement with the Chahar Lang concluded and desired me to consult Colonef Bieharakoff, who had, since my departure, been sent to command in Sultanahad. Leaving the completion of the agreement in abeyance, I hurried back to Sultanabad, the sotnia that was with me just arriving in time to reinforce the sotnia left in Sultanabad and repulse an attack by a combined force of Bakhtiari, Lurs and Gendarmes. Though unsuccessful in their attack, the rebel forces did not fall back any considerable distance, and from this time till the 27th November they remained in occupation of all the hilly country to the south and west of .Sultanabad, their outposts being within a very short distance of the town itself Tne Saham-us-Sultan, whose presence would have been useful, fled to Tehran. The Russians were it seemed in favour of the proposed agreement with the Chahar Lang and also of one with Sardar Hashmat, their only stipulation bein 0 * that they should be parties to the agreement themselves without incurring any pecuniary responsibility. As regards the Chahar Lang, the Khojabr had from the outset made it a condition that any agreement made should be with us and not with the Russians and there is no doubt this was his earnest desire. r i he explanation lay no doubt in the hope that our predominant influence w r ith the Haft Lang would be exerted to his advantage in his dealings with his more powerful neighbours. The Khojabr was, however after some further correspondence, prepared to give way on this point, but by the time the situation had improved sufficiently to render a meeting possible, it had been decided that an agreement with the Chahar Lang was undesirable and should not be proceeded with. The Khojabr-u-Smtaneh’s attitude at this juncture however was undoubtedly of service and should be remembered to his credit. In the meantime negotiations with Sardar Hashmat resulted in a joint letter being given him signed by Colonel Bicharakoff and myself promising support in return for service. A translation is attached. Sardar Hashmat with a force of 125 sowars arrived in Sultanabad on the 8th December and was given a good reception by the Russians. I presented him at the same time on behalf of Government with a khillat of Tomans 2,500. I should not omit to mention that encouraging telegrams had been sent by the Zil-us-tollltary events during the month of November. Ofi the 5th Sultanabad was attacked by a mixed rebel force which was repulsed a tei some six hours fighting. The general direction was in the hands of Salar-i-Muqtadir and Sardar Mohi, Nazar Ali Khan with his Lur sowars was also present. The Bakhtiari Khans who are known to have been with The lebels at this time and who took a prominent part in numerous outpost affairs are, Salar Masud, Abul Kasim Khan» Bahadur-i-Saltaneh, Yarulla Khan and Salavi Muazzam. Amir-i-Mufakham had also sowars with the gathering, the total number of which was computed at 2,000. Sardar Muzaffar Khoiabr’s cousin, was with the rebels, and also the Yar Ahmadi Khans. Samsam-ul- Mamalik and Khusrau Khan remained in the background but the rebel force contained a small contingent of sowars from each of them, and also from Ghulam Ah Khan. On the 27th, the Russians made a surprise attack on the rebels at Niraak Khur and captured 2 brass guns and a machine gun belonging to the Gendar merie, but they did not follow up their success and during the month of December there was little improvement in the situation. The southern part of Iraq during this month was systematically plundered by the rebels. On the 1st of January, the Russian troops in Iraq, after having previously dispersed the Bakhtiari and Gendarmes who were at Astaneh and Tuleh, res pectively, attacked and took Doulatabad. Sardar Hashmat’s sowars combined with my own escort took part in the fighting, one of the latter being killed. The following day however the Turks received reinforcements and on the 3rd the Russians were again forced to evacuate the town and retreat to Sultanabad. In this country, where events that happen before people’s eyes however trivial, assume first-class importance, the political effect was necessarily bad. The Russian troops made another sortie on the 18th of January and marched to Burujird. Sardar Mohi and Salar JMoktadir did not await their arrival but It ft with the garrison for Kermanshab. Nazar Ali Khan also departed for Tehran. At the instance of the Russian Legation, Sardar Ijlal who before the evacaution of Kermanshah was Deputy Governor there and bad since been at Kavzin, was appointed. Governor of Araq in the beginning of December and with a view to his connection with the country being of use, was subsequently also given the Governorship of Luristan. The Russian troops made no stay in Burujird but left Ali Mardan Khan there as Deputy Governor on behalf of Sardar Ijlal. It was arranged that Ali Mardan Khan should maintain 200 sowars in Burujird for which I agreed to pay so long as the town was held by him. At the end of the month however the town was reoccupied by a small Turkish force with a machine gun and some local troops. Ali Mardan' Khan has since sent an Agent to Sultanabad to receive further nstructions. During the past two months I have been in correspondence with Sardar Unjad, the Hassanawand Chief, with a view to bis bringing a force of sowars o co-operate with the Russians when an advance is made. When the Russians ast took Doulatabad and projected a further advance to Kangavar the idea ras that Sardar Amjad, in conjunction with Baqir Khan, Kakawand, should eize Nahavend. Sardar Amjad has not so far as is known been in enemy ervice, though his younger brother is reported to have gone to the Nizam-us- lultaneh. a D art from the general object of creating a party in the country favour- ble to ourselves the end to which I have been working lias been the raising t a loeaTorce? a nucleus of which only should he in being, the remainder and reater part to be ready to act as required on a move being made. In accord- nee with this idea the 'suggestion was made by the Russians that I should take ver Xe Guran and Sinjabi sowars who had accompanied them from Kerman- , , , Tehran The matter was discussed with His Majesty s hall and w « re in { th Russian Legation, and with the sanction of Minister and M. Mmorski ol tne a s The Ch i e[s an d their sowars, he former the matter ws arranged V J&gt; Sultanabad on the rho had been stopping at Shah Abdul Azim, 5th January.J I - ^ i The monthly cost of the sowars at present maintained by me is approxi mately as follows :— 110 Sardar Hashmat’s sowars 84 Guran sowars under the Zargham-us-Sultaneh and other chiefs. 8 Sinjabi sowars under Murshid Khan and Mansur Khan. Ts. 2,040 1,575 200 3,815 The cost is higher than it would otherwise have been, owing to the scarcity of wheat and barley, which are selling at double then- usual rates. The rate for barley at the end of January was Ts. 15 per Kharwar and it is rising. It has thus been impossible to fii the daily pay of sowars at less than Krans 6. To summarise the results my mission up to the present date- Though under the circumstances no positive results of a military kind could he looked for, mv deputation, well supported as it has been by funds from Basrah, has been of value in defeating enemy efforts to bring about a general hostile movement afnong the tribes of these parts, which at one time was very threatening. A strong faction also has been created that, so long as the Eussians do not suffer any serious reverse, may be relied on for such services as they are capable of. In conclusion, I desire to bring to notice the assistance given me by Mr. Moir Vice-Consul in Araq- His local knowledge and the unique position and influence he has gained in the Sultanabad district the result of many years residence in Sultanabad as Manager of Messrs. Ziegler and Co.—have been of the highest value. Translation of a letter from Sardar Hashmat of Kawareh to Lieutenant-Colonel R. L.

I beg to inform you that last night, the 7th instant (1st April 1917), Soulet-ud-Douleh arrived at Farrashband, and ordered that all the forces under him should go to Kazerun. Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli, has collected a force at Shahpur, but it is still not known in these parts in what direction Sardar Ashair intends using these men that have been collected. No reconciliation has been effected between Muhammad Ali Khan and Muhammad Khan up to. now, and Fakhr-us-Sultaneh’s efforts have been so far futile. Fakhr-us-Sultaneh himself is still at Kumarij, and is engaged in spread ing false reports every day. I further beg to state that Mirza Ali Kazeruni and Haji Abdul Nabi were ready, and bad agreed to go and interview Soulet-ud-Douleh, as repre sentatives of the Khans, but after the news, that the (Russians had revolted against their Emperor, was received the people’s attitude changed somewhat, Had they not spread this report, the state of affairs in these parts would have improved in a short time. I further beg to state that the Dashti men who had come to Borasjim, left the latter place for Dashti yesterday, the 7th instant. Mirza Muhammad Khan presented four rifles and 120 tomans to the leaders and took an oath with them that, should the Dashtis need help, Mirza Muhammad Khan would afford them assistance, while should Mirza Muhammad Khan stand in need of assistance, they should take steps to suppoit him. I be- to inform you that Mirza Muhammad Khan’s men have carried off aBnnt BoO sheen frorn Bibira which is one of Muhammad Ah Khan s villages.

The proverbially difficult “ first step ” has been taken and the original handful of officers is now being augmented, so that the pioneering stage i® emerging into the development stage.Our first efforts at Bunder Abbas were unexpectedly successful. The local material is not particularly good, but it was imperative to enroll recruits immediately and this was accomplishedalbeit much tact was necessary at the start. Captain B. C. Buck was exceptionally qualified for the task and to him the credit of creating the Bunder Abbas force and organizing the base is mainly due. Mr. Howson too and the Shuja Nizam, Deputy Governor, deserve much credit. 3. The march to Kerman was a difficult undertaking owing to the entire absence of trained transport at that season of the year, but it passed off without incident and the column was strong enough to overawe the timid Kermanis. Its arrival was instrumental in bringing about the re-establishment of law and order. 4. Becruiting was started at Kerman under serious difficulties, as it had not been found possible to supply officers or intructors for the purpose. However a start was made. More officers too were gradually appointed and Major G. L. Earran, who has displayed considerable powers of organisation and judgment, now commands about one thousand men who will shortly become a force of military value. He is also a persona grata to the Persians. 5. The march of the column to Yezd, Ispahan and finally to Shiraz has already been reported and, to some extent, constituted a lull in the organisation of the South Persia Bifles. Upon entering Ears we began to pay and organise the various detachments and, at Shiraz, the entire force, 3,000 strong, was taken over. It is however to be noted that the Persian Government bad not agreed to this, that the Persian officers were aware of this and that some of them were in close touch with tlm German prisoners in the Ark and with other bitter malcontents. I consider it a subject for congra tulation that there has been no mutiny among the officers or men, who had not only robbed openly in the interests of the Germans but had taken the British Colony prisoners almost exactly a year before. Since that date there had been, an end to discipline in the force. 6. When the gendarmerie was taken over reorganisation .was started and has been proceeding piecemeal. I have been blamed for not submit ting a complete scheme earlier but, apart froni the inadequacy of my staff of tW'O, to my mind it was imperative first of all to understand thoroughly the Swedish system. The next step was to adapt it as far as nossible to our purposes to introduce such modifications as were necessary ; and Cuy to deoidfupon the organisation unit by unit. All this has taken time but it wassounder in my opinioS to submit a scheme which is a genuine workable scheme and to some y extent tested, rather than to submit one which did not embody the fruits of experience. A final reason was my ineTto larce demands on India where its military resources were stiained^ to the utmost. The South Persia Kifies units already practically organised include— Divisional Headquarters. Ears Brigade Headquarters. Ears Brigade Signalling School. Kerman Brigade Headquarters. Abadeh District Headquarters. Bunder Abbas Base Depot and District. 1st Cavalry. # . 2 nc [ j5 (in process of organisation). 3 ) JJ 3rd 4th 1st Battery Artillery. 2nd „ 3rd ,, 3&gt; j 1st Machine Gun Battery (Mounted)._ 1st Engineers (in process of organisation). (in process of organisation).1st Infantry. 2nd 3rd 4th 5 th Medical Corps. t-) ' j 1st Mule Corps. Sanitary Sections. Veterinary Section. Barrack Establishments, such as workshops for armourers, carpenters, tailors, saddlery, shoemakers. Three complete bakeries. Clerical establishments, Persian for H. Q., Accountants and regimental, &amp;c., requirements. Supply Beserve Depots including depots on the trade routes for troops S. P. Bifl.es and officials. Corps of mounted and dismounted levies. In Pars alone 63 posts are garrisoned by the S. P. Bifles (2,100 men) for the protection of some 300 miles of trade routes. Both in Kerman and Ears improvements have been made to roads. The 1st Engineer Coy. of Ears is at present making the road from Neriz passable for motor vehicles. . Supplies of rations and fodder for the next year have been arranged for the whole force with the possible exception of Bunder Abbas. In addition to the above Persian units a Wireless Troop and Motor Despatch details of British ranks have been organised. Indents for supplies and equipment for the whole force have been prepared and the men partially clothed and outfitted. 7 8 9 7. It must be borne in mind that in Ears, our principal area, we have not only taken over a disorganised force but also an important trade route which has to be guarded. Erom the point of view of military efficiency these scattered units should have been collected at one or two centres and trained. As matters actually are, the detachments on the road cannot be relieved until other men are trained and sent out. In other words we shall be holding the road with men of very slight military value. To make the best of a bad situation I am concentrating the South Persia Bifles into the villages and placing local levies in the posts. I am also thinking of placing a strong force of Indian troops at Dehbid, which is the most important point on the road? 8. It is for the above reasons that I am convinced that every effort should be made to attract the Soulat-ud-Douleh to our side. He will not prove a satisfac^ tory worker at first, if at all, and resembles the wild ass of the desert in his lack of reliability. But his hostility would be very (? embarrassing) just now and it is sounder to make every effort to influence him to join us than to adopt a policy of refusal of his services—a policy certain to end in bloodshed. Einally, it is doubtful whether his brother would be more satisfactory than he is himself in the position of Ilkhani. 9. Looking back over the past year, the survey is satisfactory upon the whole, Kazerun is a failure so far, but the road to the north is relatively safe, and law and order are being gradually re-established by His Highness the Earman Earma, whose staunch loyalty to the British is a pleasure to report. The scarcity of wheat has been ably dealt with by Colonel Gough and His Highness; the latter is now tackling the locust question with energy and foresight?I 0 ' ^lie growth of the force in its first year is reports. The totals for March 1917 are as follows shown in the monthly Pars Brigade Kerman Brigade Bunder Abbas ... 3,385 men. ... 1,027 „ 418 „ Grand total ... 5,398 There is no lack of recruits of good quality, but we have declined to enlist more men than could be handled. The supplies of horses is one of our chief difficulties. 11. In conclusion, I am especially indebted to Lieutenant-Colonel B. Hunter, who has been Staff Officer and, later, Officer Commanding Bars Brigade. ^ lo his energy, devotion to duty, and capacity, the preliminary organisation of the force is chiefly due. He has been ably seconded by Captain Hay Thorburn, who has done the entire work of the Headquarter Office for the last two months. I think that it is only fair to these officers to give as my deliberate opinion that they have each done the work of two men with efficiency. Needless to say the strain on them has been very severe. Lieutenant Weldon, who joined the force at Shiraz, has also worked indefatigably. His knowledge of the country and language has been invaluable. Binally, Major Bruce, 15th Lancers, and Major Bothwell, 23rd Mountain Battery, have both taken much time and trouble to help us in our need although we had no claim whatever on the services of these two most efficient and capable officers. Copies of this letter are sent to — The Chief of the General Staff, His Majesty’s Minister, Sir Percy Cox, Major Trevor, and Officers Commanding Kerman and Bunder Abbas. 127 No. 19-C., dated Shiraz, the 21st March (received 17th April) 1917.

I have the honour to forward herewith translations of certain letters and extracts from a diary found in the possession of the Germans when they were taken over in the Ark. Also a copy ot the statement of one °f ‘he Germans’ servants and notes on the doings of the Germans gathered fiom various sources and collated by Captain Thorbum. 2. I would take this opportunity of expressing my extreme indebtedness to Mr. Gardner, Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persm, Shiraz, for trans a ing the German documents. I understand that Captain MacMahon has seized other papers from the Germans and is bringing em o ' oocur jf also prove interesting, but to avoid the deiay wh.c i “ I were to wait for the receipt of these, I have decrded to submrt this report6S once. The diaries are interesting and sometimes amusing, but perhaps the most noticeabie feature is the gullibility of Dr. Zu-meyer, I am not making any other comments but notion is being taken where necessary. 3 Copies of this letter and enclosures are being sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Chief of General Staff, Sir Percy Cox, the Deputy Resident, Bushire, His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, and His Majesty s Consul, h.ermau, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz.

My, letter read as follows: my last letter of the 6th January should reach you through Nasr Diwan. I wrote to you on the 14th and 24th November and on the 9th and 19th December and have received your letters of the 2nd, 18th and 21th November. Nothing further has come to hand. I have sent you the latest news out of the “ Times of India” of December 20th. Germany and her Allies have made peace proposals after taking Roumania. The conditions are apparently status quo before the war, but with Poland and Lithuiania independent. There is not a word about Servia. No official reply has been received from the enemy powers. The papers scorn Germany’s step in the matter, but the dismissal of Ministers followed by the change of Cabinets of England, Prance, Russia and Italy point to the fact that perhaps they are thinking of peace, from the seats of war nothing import ant and there is nothing about Persia, Mesopotamia or Caucasus * (goes on about Roumania and Bucharest). Moldavia, the enemy are still holding their own and in Greece the powers have given Constantine an ultimatum on the 14th December. Have you received my letter with extracts from Bruggmann Gutras (Ctorias ?) and the Turkish Ambassador ? A few days ago a messenger arrived from Bruggmann; he had two and half months before left Sirkuh. Bruggmann with two Germans and two Austrians and Obeydulla ^re at Sirkuh near Darab. T'o-day I heard that the Sirkuhies had attacked a large caravan of munitionsfor the British from Bunder Abbas near Sirjan. Alhamdullah.

He brought the following note^-— Kermanshah, 2nd November 1916, a month ago a messenger left bearing news and money for you. The messenger Ismail bears a letter from Count Beldi to the Austrians and ‘ Bedject’ (cheque) for a hundred pounds for your selves. Please acknowledge receipt as soon as possible. I repeat various news. The expedition is under the order of the Irak Gouppe (General Grossman) which is again placed under Leman and the Minister of war. Since [February 1st, 1916, * * all the former dispositions are given up and now follows military ranks and orders.

I am endeavouring to collect baggage which was sent back and to direct it home as well to win back the baggage lost, I am working hard for Ispahan and South Persia. Events in Mesopotamia are at present influencing Persian events; a British attack is expected. William Pashchen was taken prisoner by the Russians, Yoight and Winkleman by the British. Peter Paschen is at present here having escaped from the British at Ispahan. W 7 agner is at Herat. Give precise advice about all Germans, Austrians and Indians, &amp;c., interned in Ispahan also about dead, wounded and about remains of the baggage. I invite Seiler and Zugmeyer to inform me about the doings of various members also about the Austrians for the purpose of distinctions * * * of the members. “ If you agree I will open your post and will send you extracts—all the party is included in this offer, “ Try and communicate with Wassmuss who is in safety. Only escape from Shiraz can help you. The war news is favourable; all colossal attacks of the French have been repulsed for months, the small gains of the opponents is in no way comparable with their terrible sacrifice, it The confidence in Germany is boufidless, the same on the Russian and Italian fronts, Russian attacks have ceased and whole of Dobrujia is in our hands (then follows a few old bits of_ war news); the bearer Ismail has received 50 tomans.

We cannot intrust any important matters with him as he ernes blabing about it with him. He would be pleased if we were sent to Bushire and that he should remain here alone. We cannot regard him any longer as one of us. Madam Roever has handed over the keys of the Bank to the British. Colonel Gough says we are prisoners of war and probably will be sent to India. Reuter. The cable has been interrupted here but this however is only a local at Abadeh. All 700 Turki gendarmes have been dismissed. 17th October .—Six months in prison, 2 years in Asia. Declaration by Roever. His letter to Colonel Gough. It is now very cold and two blankets are required. It is said that the Kermanshah has been taken by the British. The British Consul told Mrs. Roever that Azim-ul-Mulk brings replies to our letters from the Barman Earma. Qawam &amp; Co. not on the best terms with Barman Barma and British. No Reuter but report of the fall of Basrah. Wassmuss Munshi writes that W. is better and that he is free and at laige. Perhaps the Turks have arranged for a provisional Government under Mustaufi (Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik). It is impossible to find out who is at the helm and whether Tehran is occupied or not. At any rate it shows that all news of the democrat * * * * It appears that Consul proposes to^ come to the Ans with the Barman Barma. We propose to oppose his this visit. Tne Qawam’s servants talk about making the Austrian Putullzanella the head of Q'awam’s Artillery. I ■ if I j I I i 1 i, ■ ' v- 38th October .—On the 28th October, the'British arrested the Armenian telegraph clerk because he has let out the news of the declaration of war by Scandinavia. Nazim-ul-Mulk is to go to Gayum. During the night Seiler managed to get past the gate guard in Persian Costume. Besting and Sergeant Przyszlak let themselves down over the wall by rope. The servant Jaffar is to help them as guide. Up to 10 o’clock nothing is as yet discovered. English Persian Consular Medical Officer goes to Abadeh to see Sardar Motazed. It must therefore be inferred that Sykes party has not reached there nor likely to be there very soon. 29th October. —Nazim-ul-Mulk has been away all day shooting or visit ing. Returns only late in evening as yet no alarm on account of flight. Long councils about our attempts at flight * * * * * * in parts possible. Karl Mayish has fantastic ideas. Hopes rest on the Moharram procession which will be taking place in about a week’s time. Letter from Wassmuss. He has shin bone cut through and demands medical help. Again long council whether a visit from one of our doctors will be permitted, and whether it can be contrived with plans for our escape. Seiler is supposed to be ill and every thing is done to keep up this deception. Basting * * * will not keep any longer. No news from west. No Reuter. Nothing sure about telegraphic communication. (Old) Abbas Ali departs with letter giving news. 30th October —Nazim again goes away in early morning with horse and mules. So far no source of alarm. The Swedish declaration of war is considered as undoubted in whole town. Likewise the cause of the imprison ment of the Armenian telegraphist. Haji Kasam came to us for a talk. The gendarmerie demand our release which is to take place now in a few days. Ispahan is said to be entirely in the hands of the Bakhtiaris and the Russians to have fled. Tehran is said to be occupied entirely by Millet and Germans and the Russians are surrounded in Kazvin. * * * The soldier Causlishak falls from the verandah and breaks his leg. 31st October .—In the morning a short talk with Nazim. Seiler supposed to be suspected of typhoid fever. Note concerning winter clothing. Wass muss box. Affair of Shoeder plundered box. The Munshi is taken to a friend of Barman Barma kept there in sort of freedom. Turks said to have occupied Ispahan. Kasbgais are said to be planning attack on Shiraz.' 1 %F n _ iV 7 0wem6er.—Seiler’s flight still undiscovered. Whilst the windows are being inspected ; the soldier Musgus lies in Seiler’s bed and thereby deceived the guard. Seiler and Pasting have thereby got a start office nights. The Munshi confirms from Parman Parma Circles the story of the capture of lehran and the declaration of war by Scandinavia. Successes in Eowpt should also be noted. Nazim admits that Sykes has been attacked by Bakhtiaris near Kumishah but expected m 10 days. 20 Indian sowars said to have arrived from Abadeh. Mysterious Bakhtian messenger who whispers to Bhonstroff “ Khub Meshevad . Long discussion regarding Amba. Munshi is taken to British Consulate. 2nd A 7 0 w&lt;?wa&amp; 0 r.——Humours increase of a severe beating of Sykes’ party. In spite of this in case someone finds a means of getting away it is firstly necessary for a doctor to go to Wassmuss. Waldman has the intention of getting over the wall to-night. I have a sort of idea that he thinks merely * * * regarding carrying it out. Neidermeyer recounts in a rather confused way, an attempted escape which he planned but kept from us and had to give up at the last minute, through the misfortune which befell the soldier Goschupunt; also in this case my impression is he only wishes to ensure himself the glory of a courageous idea. Some Persian hats and a rope have been found with the Austriansjas a consequence, the guards have been reinforced and a few damaged walls have been repaired. Sykes is said to have lost all his caravan. The Ispahan Armenians are supposed to be with him and local Armenians are said to be preparing for flight. The British Commandant of the Gendarmerie put up in the Barracks an Anglo-Persian Notice of brotherhood. Letter sent to Wassmuss. The news of Seiler’s flight begins to filter amongst the servants. Nazira goes away in the early morning and does not return till late at night. 150 Gendarmes who were held in readiness to ride out to meet Sykes have received orders apparent ly to remain here. What this may mean we do not know. A small tower is built in the Ark. The entrance gate remains always closed from to-day. 3rd November .—It is the 6th night without Seiler’s flight having been noticed. Nazim again leaves the Ark early in the morning apparently certain news emanating from Barman Parma quarter that Bandar Dilam has been taken by the Turks. Contrary to yesterday’s news it is said to-day that a British officer with 60 gendarmes has ridden out to meet Sykes. It is again stated that he has lost all the caravan and besides that, the transport animals of the Armenians accompanying him. After supper Nazim returns. I wish to speak with him but he sends word to say he has a bad headache and begs to be excused. Contrary to yesterday’s report that Eoever has been allowed to go to his , house it is said to-day that he is still with the British. Despite that, he has, as yet, had no news brought to us; and what is more his wife is allowed to visit him daily and also his servant. The Kashgais are said to be at one and to have addressed letter to Parman Parma &amp; Co. that he and Qawam must leave the town with the British or they will besiege it. The troop sent out to meet Sykes to-day is reduced to 1 Sultan and 20 men. Gough is said to have demanded Barman’s assistance about the attack on Sykes, and the Parman Parma is said to have replied in an uncertain manner. 4th November .—A week since Seiler’s flight. Nazim leaves the Ark at 8 a.m. An advance of 6 days is paid. Sykes is said to be in Dehbid. At the English Consulate it is admitted that the Turks have occupied Behbehan. Nazim returned about 3 p.m. and demands immediately in the name of Parman Parma to speak to Seiler. As there is no way out of it, I tell him in our room what has happened. He puts relatively few questions, telephones, comes along with the Chief of Police. General sensation ! Some of the Austrians are searched on the place of flight. _ In the nnmn- time 3 men came back from the bazar. At one moment it is said that they are those who escaped being brought back. Gronberger and Misas opposeI ' 111 1 1 i 1 g;| fj]: ! v]K| [ 'I. . MI' ; if li! lilr i i the search. Gronberger catches hold o£ the guard. Great scandal ! TI cjx slight search in our room. The Austrians make a great disturbance because tool, etc., had been taken away from them. Reinforcing of guards, control ling, otherwise nothing is done. Those of the guards who are not effected thereby are openly pleased by this intermettze. Nazim himself retains very well his composure. It is said that a troop of Turks and Mujahadins with artillery are on their way here from Ispahan and that Ispahan itself is in their hands. Why Nazira should have wanted to speak to Seiler. Whether he was suspicious or what else remains a mystery. 5th November ;—Nazim discovers the way of escape from the roof. I however assert that Seiler left through the gate. No special rules are made for safeguarding us. In the town general hilarity over the successful escape. Nazim is suspected by the British of complicity. The Tofangchis say that if any one wishes to punish them they would speak out. They are paid so poorly that they wont stand any thing of that sort. Pursuit is apparently instituted we are all counted and the absence of 2 Germans and 2 Austrians is estab lished. One Austrian we had always counted one more on account of the daily allowance, so he is now recovered as having escaped. The Major wishes to give up the command of the Austrians after considera tion Greisinger takes over the Command. 'As however the culprits make their excuses to the Major, he takes back the Command. No important news politi cally or otherwise. Our servants and messenger are allowed to go as formerly in the bazar. Wedig occupies Seiler’s room and his is in turn taken for the doctor’s consulting room. 6th November. —All dogs are taken out of the Ark. I only stood out for Wedig’s “ Tasi” to remain. I as the defender of dogs. The Munski Q.awa-i- Saadat visits us. He is in light imprisonment at a relations of the Qawam’s. He confirms about Scandinavia and Bukharest. He heard of big German victories in Russia which the British Consul tries to make light of—otherwise he knows nothing new. He has been instructed to pump us regarding the escape and is nominally informed. He has not yet been to the British Consul. Nazim had slight suspicion about Seiler and had therefore insisted on seeing him. I tell Munshi that Seiler and Testing went through the gate and the Austrian went over the wall. Sowars sent to search the country round for Seiler &amp; Co. returned after fruitless search. It is said in the bazar that Sykes is again fighting with Bakhtiaris this side of Abadeh. Nazim brings us Reuter of the 1st to 5th which has recently re-appeared again. The news is of no importance and in no way confirms the report re Scandinavia and Bukharest * * * * To be noted Nazim is very friendly and expresses regret that his idea of taking us for drive can not be carried out now after this escape, 7th November .—Forty gendarmes who had been sent to Kazerun to Fakkr- i-Saltaneh are said to have themselves returned. It is said Bakhtiaries are marching on Shiraz from Behbehan. The English woman said to be on the way from Ispahan to here is said to he taken by Bakhtiaries. Nazim visits u«. It is impossible to get anything out of him politically. All the big people here seen. Still he hold firmly on the side of the British. I again speak to him about winter clothes. Reuter, etc. We are all to be * * * about which I take him round with difficulty. All Ashura processions have been stopped hence the day was quite quiet. 8th November .—Sykes is said to have been completely plundered at Hehhid by the Chief of the Boramedi. The Telegraphist at Dehbid is said to have lent him clothes. Fatk-ul-Mulk is said to have put himself entirely against the British in the question of Gendarmerie pay. It is impossible to obtain any news and do not ever know who is at the head of things at Ispahan and Tehran. The amount required for winter clothes is granted. Nazim declares that Sykes would not be arriv ing yet and that he was ill in Kinari. ^ ]*•Sykes has had, it is said, 32 casualties. 9th November,— *•»*** 10th November. Sykes expected 10th or 12th. Some officers and sowars already arrived. Sykes comes with 500 men, 4 guns, 200 mules and large mixed caravan. b A lot of Ispahan refugees. Paschen brought to Ispahan and from there to have escaped the police. Mahmud Khan (Sultan) Kermani who occupied the post at Abadeh is being brought. Becker ill with malaria. Sheoder demands as over 45 to be set free. Sykes awaited to-morrow. That part of his party had arrived is untrue. In the evening it is said that 200 transport animals have been brought into town under supervision of Dr. Woollatt. The gendarmes have no longer Persian Badges and are to receive British (Protectorate of Pars ?). In two weeks’ time the British will attempt to open up Bushire road. Nazim brings 4 letters from new Karguzar. One from Madame Wedig, other, from Sommer. Ismail and Haji Amu have therefore safely arrived with their packages. The Parman Parma has sent to enquire how we are and what we want. Sykes enters at midday and is received with salute of 15 guns. He has 10 English officers, 100 sowars, 150 to 200 infantry, large caravan, 2 machine guns and 4 small guns. All rumours about his having been plundered are therefore bunkum. Three wounded are with him as also Sultan Mohammad Khan. Munshi gives following account of Sykes* force as counted by him 8 white men. 10 Indian officers. 30 sowars. 250 infantry. 4 guns. 2 maxims. 250 mules. 30 camels. 13th November .—Nazim visits Sykes. In afternoon visit returned by some one, and one officer. The Ulemas and people protest to Parman Parma against British rule. It is said that gendarmes are to take over the guarding of us, that of course means British, but nothing official. Sykes reported to have said I behaved “ very decently ” in Kerman. (Rumours 4 'weeks ago Turks said to have been * * * « * Russians said to have left Ispahan and gone North. Peter Paschen said to have fled from British Consul so therefore was not rescued on the way. 14th November. —Wedig’s telegram to his wife is accepted. M. Magaar said that Russians had made separate peace after fall of Petrograd. Syl^es reported to have declared to gendarmes “The British officers are here as instructors just as the Swedes but otherwise whole affair is quite Persian. That people should prepare themselves to march against the enemies of P. [viz. Russian).” The rumour of Russian peace probably confirmed, also that Ispahan Russians are coming here. What as a matter of fact, Sykes did say is not clear. It is again said we are to move out of here but nothing official. 15th November .—Letter to Wassmuss sent. Persian papers say that heavy fighting has taken place at Riga that Sweden has sold us 5,000 horsesa' 8! {II I :! fit! f . I r &amp;c., &amp;c. Nazim tells us that Sykes in his speech had described bimself as such a friend of the Persians as to have drawn the enmity of the Russians upon himself. It is evidently from this that yesterday’s report arose. Munshi announces the taking of Ispahan. The gendarmes too said to have shot at an Indian and to have said “What does such a kaffar matter *\ Nazim knows nothing about our moving out of here. The Ark tofangchis have orders to sleep with their bandoleers on. Remarks of Nazim about our movements depending on the British. Explicate letter to Earman, a copy of which was retained. *«*•*•* 16th November. —Letter received from Wassmuss. Nth November. —Sultan Muhammad Khan brought to the Ark. Politically he knows nothing Of attack on Sykes he knows nothing. About further ideas of British he has only opinions. The news that the gendarmes sent to Kazerun have been looted is false, on contrary they have brought back a gun. British officer with 10 men has gone to Kazerun to win over Nasir Divan. Opening of Bushire road taken in hand. Peter Paschen said to have been brought to Ispahan in chains (?). Rumours about Ispahan * * * The small section which left here yesterday towards Kazerun has been attacked and that indeed only a few farsacks from here. Has returned with money but lost animals. Sykes’ force has noted {sic.) to be sent. Qawam and Nazim are to leave shortly for Lar to collect taxes. 21st November. —Yesterday it was said that the gendarmes would make a shuluk, but nothing happened. It is said a telegram has come from Glerup saying Sykes has nothing whatever to do with the gendarmes and that these ere entirely under the direct orders of Tehran. 22nd November .—Evening mess is discontinued, now 11 have their supper in their own rooms. Nazim talks of proposed move to garden of Armenian Jahanian. Nothing as yet settled. In evening he comes and visits us and is very friendly but tells us nothing of importance.

A Lar Chieftain who was a prisoner with the Soulet had been released and had gone to his own country to raise disturbances.

They had a bottle of Beniditine (28 Krs.) with Neidermeyer and Griesenger to celebrate the completion of their two years’ friendship. 18th December .—It is recounted with the greatest certainty that the Turks occupied Kazerun yesterday. Telegraphic advice could still be transmitted vesterday. The Governor was taken prisoner and local Gendarmerie disarmed. The wire has since been cut. Sykes’ troops are to march out against Kazerun to-morrow. Qawam, Nazim and 130 tufangchis are to leave the town to morrow. Our custody is to be handed over to the son of the Vice-Governor with the help of our Munshi. The Gendarmerie are to become our guards. Until evening no change takes place.

The Chief of these is Azam-i-8ultaneh. The Barman Parma people are very polite. The Chief of the guard speaks French. Shortly afterwards Qawam Nazim Chief of Police 3 gendarmes are arrested. Search is made for Fath- ul-Mulk. No one knows the reason why 100 gendarmes from Kazerun and posts, arrive here having been looted. Gendarmes-Sarbazes and men of the Barman Parma occupy the Ark. Late in the evening it appears that all these imprisonments were rot. 20th December .—It appears now that it was an attempt on the part of the British to imprison the Qawam but could not be carried out without fighting. At any rate a great enmity has sprung between the British and Qawam. The imprisonment of 3 gendarme officers appear to be correct. The reason appears to be in part refusal to go to Kazerun and partly political intrigue. The principal event is the news that the Kazerunis are marching on Shiraz. This is depicted in different variations Turks-German. Kasghais 'Wassmuss Saianaglan 5,000 men and so on. At any rate something seems to be developing * Sangars are built and other preparatiorii. Nasir-ul-Mulk is said to have received a letter from Nasir-i-Divan that the besiegers will he here in three days. But nothing reliable has been obtained. Qawam and the Barman Parma wish to remain neutral. Qawam is said to have warned the people against English Bank notes. A run on these at any rate takes place there is a general refusal to take paper money. Nazim\St) t £ '7f visii/g us to take leave. Demands a certificate.

No confirmation however. To-morrow 200 gendarmes are leaving to go against Kazerun. Soulet is said to he in the neighbourhood with his force. Bun on the Bank seems to have subsided. Barman Farraa said to have received a tele gram from Tehran to imprison the British (! ! !). He at any rate appears to have no intention of leaving. It would appear as if he is counting with local conditions. The Indians are said to have taken an enemy tower on the Kazerun Boad with the loss of 12 men. 22nd December. —The gendarmes march out but have intention of going over to the enemy. An English officer has been taken prisoner. Various rumours. The attackers said to have been beaten according to one version ; according to another they have advanced 4 farsacks. 23rd December .— 24th to 27th December .— ***** 23th December. —Advice received of British and gendarme reverse is gradually confirmed by Kasim and Azim. Out of 400 Indians it is said only 53 returned with rifles, rest have been plundered. A good many of the gendarmes are said to have taken to their heels. Many wounded amongst same day. One officer and 15 Indians missing, two guns and two machine guns have fallen in the hands of the Kazeruni as well as 400 miles with provision, etc. Three mules with silver and one with gold. All the troops are said to have come back in great disorder. Part is now in the town and part.2 farsacks from here in a comparative strong position. It is now said neither Germans nor Turks are with the Kazemnis. Souiet is reported to be supporting them secretly. Barman Barma advised through Munshi Karim and a letter that he had better leave the British side. 23th Decemoer. As far as we can make out the British are 4 farsacks from here in strong positions. Over 40 casualties, 1 British officer killed, one mortally wounded. Many animals, ammunitions, arms and money have been lost. Nasir Divan is said to have written to the Barman Barma that they had nothing against him but he must abandon the English. 30th December -—Assembly of notables at the Barman Barma’s Palace.

Statement by servants of German Prisoners. * a ?v, lett ® r s an d correspondence which passed between the Germans and t eir friends outside the Ark through the Agency of Nazim-ul-Mulk and his agents. Mmza Hussain, an officer in the Persian Army, NazirpUNazam and othei officers of the Persian Army helped them and know about it. The last mentioned by pretending that his son was ill and had to visit a doctor went to the room of Dr. Baker, gave him letters and received from him replies. Nasir-i-Nazam always went during the night to Dr. Baker and had long conversations with him and arranged with him all that there was wanted. 2. When the prisoners were in the house of the Qawam, one night Seiler, Zugmeyer, Dr. Baker, Major * * * * * (Aon Yersen?) Nazem-i-Mulk and Qawam went in a carriage to Afifabad to Soulet and were there until morning. The result of their meeting was the Germans agreed to pay three hundred thousand tomans in the following manner. Soulet was to get one hundred thousand tomans. Qawam one hundred thousand tomans, Hussain Khan Bochagchi fifty thousand tomans, Amir Agba Khan and Khorsid Khan, the Chiefs of the Baharlus, fifty thousand tomans on the following conditions :— The plan decided upon was that the action would commence on the follow ing spring and Shiraz would be attacked from all three sides Hussein Kuan Bocbagohi with Obeidulla, &amp;c., from the direction of Yezd, the Baharlus on their side and Soulet on all the passes of Shiraz towards Sarhad. The Germans themselves promised at that time to send a force with sufficient munitions from Kermansbah via Behbehan and would give great assistance, it was thus decided hut the Persians said that as they were prisoners it was impossible to rely upon their promises and that perhaps the German Government would declare one day that they were simply soldiers and would not fulfil their pro mises, the Germans then promised to send two horsemen to Kermanshah to get the necessary documents regarding this affair. Eventually two horsemen, one of Qawam’s and other of Souiet’s left for Kermanshah, two days afterwards Haji Agha, the muleteer of Zugmeyer, left for Kermanshah with letters. For these he was given four pounds. He was given two very good letters from the Germans at Kermanshah for the Qawam and Soulet. (The informer only saw the name on one of the envelopes which was addressed to Prince * * * *.) Eventually the replies from the letters arrived just as the prisoners were put into the Ark. All the replies were favourable and all instructions for spring had already been arranged, the messenger brought with them very good documents for the Qawam and Soulet. The two horses of the messengers had died on the way so they were given others at Kermanshah, the messenger arrived a few days before Seiler escaped. 3. A few days before the escape of Seiler the Germans sent an old man called Agha Ali “ Haji Amu ” to Ispahan. Five months ago Daudali Khan came to Shiraz from Neriz, he had with him also Mohamed Khan, the Indian, who was with Dr. Biach at Baft and had been set free at the time when Colonel Gough was nominated at Tehran to be Consul at Shiraz he went to Hussein Khan, the brother-in-law of Soulet, to the Kashgais. At present he is with the Kashgais. 4. Before the escape of Obeidulla at Sirjan the Germans received a letter from Sirjan by two messengers, one of these was arrested, the other managed through Jahangir Khan “ the domestic of the Qawam to get to the Germans, when the news of the arrest of the other messenger had been heard they took an Austrian from the Bagh-i-Nimazi to the house of the Qawam and was shown a letter which he could not understand, the Qawam sent it to Sardar Motazed but it could not be understood ; from the abovementioned Uterthe Germans learnt that Obeidnlla had joined the others and Shahzada Hussein and Hussein Khan Boehagchi and their followers had fled.5. Fifteen days ago (5th February 1917) the Germans received a letter from Neidermeyer from Kermanshah through Nazera-i-Mulk. He said,—I left Afghanistan and disguised like a woman, I went to Tehran and there I com pleted my mission and met the necessary people to return to Kermanshah. I will also he of the number who are detailed to come against Ispahan and Shiraz. He also reported that 510 Austrian prisoners deserted from Russia and at* present in Afghanistan. Kardoff and Wostroff have been blamed and have been recalled to Berlin, the latter was formerly Consul in Shiraz. 6. When the British force arrived at Shiraz it was said that 200 Indians with Russians had arrived, the Germans sent to Nazem-i-Mulk that the British force was coming and it was necessary for him to hurry up with things, Kazem-i-Mulk replied “ this is our chance because whenever we want we can have the rifles and ammunition , \ 7. When the British had occupied the Ark the Germans wrote many letters which they gave to the servant of Yedik with the help of Ghulam Afsian they wanted to send to Nazem-i-Mulk, the letters were put into a leather bag but because of the searching at the door they were unable to send it and these letters have been taken with the prisoners on the route. 8. There are fourteen boxes of Dr. Professor Schoeder and are at Roever’s house, also seven hundred pounds. There are also many articles belonging to the Gendarmerie at Roever’s house. Professor Schoeder when he left Shiraz on the former occassion had four thousand pounds which is put away in a box but not known where, the rest of the money was divided between his servants and Mirza Hussain who is now in the South Persia Rifles and Fath- ul-lVlulk. 9. Just recently when the Qawam arrived at Fassa and Afghan spy came to him and gave him letters from Obeidulla after that he came to Shiraz when he sent the letters through Nazem-i-Mmk to the Germans and received their replies after that he returned to Sarkuh. On another occasion he made the following statement :— Seiler and Nazem-i-Mulk were on very friendly terms and used to go to each other’s rooms; when he entered the room one day he saw money passing. Seiler then pretended to be ill and he was kept away from the room for some days. The German doctor gave a lot of wine and arak to the soldier of the guard and he is of the opinion that Seiler and the other escaped through the door by changing their clothes with guards. Nazim-ul-Mulk afterwards asked him about it and he replied that (i you should know better The Germans were much upset the day Mustafa Khan and (as it was reported) the Qawam were arrested. Qawam Sadat, the interpreter, gave him a letter from Seiler for Soulet, but in reply said “ can’t take it Qawam Saadat there abused him and gave it to Hussein (Ispahani who were with Seiler) who gave it to Soulet at that time in Shiraz. At that time Abdul Samad (late Consular clerk) was there. Soulet got the letter and sent a reply. After Seiler fled, Mirza Mustafa Khan came to Nazim-ul-Mulk’s house. When the oflicers finished they all left except Zugmeyer, he went to collect knives, &amp;c., but found the door closed and locked inside. They were there for 2 hours. Dr. Karim Khan came to see Nazim-ul-Mulk. Then Dr. Becker came forward and took Dr. Karim Khan to the other side after that Mirza Mustafa Khan left and then shortly afterwards Zugmeyer left the room. Enclosure No. 6. Notes about the prisonees at Shilaz. I. During March 1916, the tide began to turn against South Persia owing to various causes amongst which we?e—- (1) 1 he reverse at Deh Seim. the Germans in( 2 ) (3) (4) The defeat of the party at Bampur.

The feeling was got a definite order to leave III. On 29th March the first party left for Shiraz and on the 4th day out they were attacked by the Bachagchis at Saadrabad (Saidabad?). 1V * lst A P r il the second party left Kerman under the command of Seiler, after 3 days they reached Sefteh and the following day they joined the 1st party and concentrated at Karansera (7 farsacks from Sirjan). Y. They halted 5 days at Bagh-i-Hussain (Sirjan) and on 20th April both parties left for Shiraz, leaving Di\ Cuturias in charge of 4 wounded Austrians at Sirjan. . VI. At Arsenjan they were attacked by Arabs and had to flee leaving behind much of their property including a small wireless apparatus, and also he Persians who had accompanied them. VII. After two days the fugitives arrived at Zarghun and the next day when they left for Najafabad, Shir Khan and his son Kisa Khan Arab attacked them and as there was a river across their road they could not get their luggage over and had to flee without it. In this fight one Austrian officer was killed. VIII. On 26th April all the Germans and Austrians arrived in Shiraz and were taken to the Gendarmerie Barracks. IX. The following day they were all taken to the Ark and handed over their money to Patb-ul-Mulk. X. On 28th.April they were taken to the house of Ata-ud«Dowleh who was then Chief of the Police. XL About 6th May the Qawam arrived at Shiraz and about 12th May he took the officers to his own house, but the Austrians, &amp;c., remained with Ata-ud-Dowleh, XII. After about a month the Austrians, Afghans, Turks and Persians were housed in the Baghi-Nimazi. After about 3 months the Germans, Austrians and Officers of the Gendarmerie were taken to the Ark but still under the QawanPs guards and the Nazim-ul-Mulk (brother-in-law of the Qawam) was in charge. The Afghans, Turks and Kermanis were imprisoned in the house of Morad-ed-Dowlah. XIII. On the arrival of His Highness Prince Barman Earma this arrangement was kept on. XIV. On 28th October Seiler, Easting and Prizgszlak escaped. The first by going through the door disguised and the other two over the wall, but this was only discovered on 4th November. Only three escaped not four as reported previously, the mistake having arisen owing to the fact that an extra ration was always drawn. This does not reflect much credit on those who were in charge, that not even the exact number of prisoners was known. After the discovery of the flight no important alterations were made in the method of keeping the prisoners who were left in the QawanPs charge. XV. The complacency of Nazim-ul-Mulk in the escape of Seiler is most probable both from Zugmeyer’s diary and from the servant’s statement which in other respects is very accurate. Also popular opinion is that he was privy to the flight.XVI. Wl en the British troops arrived efforts were made to find another suitable place to keep the prisoners in as the Barman Farma objected to British guards being put on them in the Ark. As however the Ark was obviously the only suitable place in deference to Barman Barma’s wishes, they were allowed to remain under the Persian Guard of the Qawam’s men. XVII. In December the Persian Government began to insist that the Governor-General should assume the responsibility of the charge of the prisoners but he procrastinated and managed to avoid replacing the Qawam’s guard by his own men until on the 18th December, when Mirza Mustafa Khan, the Adviser of the Qawam, had been arrested in connection with the Kazerun affairs, it was found that the Ark and towers were still in the Qawam’s hands. This forced the Governor-General to promptly assume charge of the prisoners and Azam-i-Sultaneh assisted by Qawam Saadat. (The German’s own Munshi) was put in charge of the prisoners. XVIIi. In the beginning of January negotiations were started for the removal of all the prisoners to Ispahan, and the Russians agreed to take them over to Kumiskah. The Governor-General asked for permission to hand over the prisoners and the Persian Government, while agreeing, tried to avoid the responsibility of the move by giving evasive replies which frightened the Governor-General who promptly refused to agree to hand them over.

On the btk of February a report was received from what appeared to be reliable source that an attempt was being made to make a hole in the wall, and also (showing ?) the way in which letters were passing out, and in it was described (s*«c). The matter was reported to the Governor-General and a hurried inspection of the Ark was made. Although one or two places were suspicious nothing definite was found. The report though discredited at the time was subsequently proved to he correct from the diaries which were confiscated. XX. Eventually on 15th Behruary, inspite of the fact that the Governor- General had not received definite orders to hand over the prisoners, they were taken over by the British Indian troops and a thorough search was made and all papers, money, &amp;c., taken from them. The pick-axe was also found. All the prisoners were inspected and identification marks taken. XXI. From the extracts attached it will be seen that they had kept up a correspondence with Wassmuss and were undoubtedly a most dangerous factor for intrigues. XXII. 17th February, the German and Austrian prisoners left Shiraz for Ispahan under escort of 121th Infantry commanded by Captain MaeMalon. XXIII. They requested that their Munshi, Qawam-i-Saadat and one or two of their Persian servants (who had been their go-betw 7 eens with messengers, &amp;c.) should be allowed to accompany them. This was of course not allowed. Two of their servants managed to overtake them at the first stage, but were arrested and sent back. One of these eventually gave a most acurate report of the doings of the Germans and also informed us that other papers and money were still in possession of the Germans having been successfully concealed w r hen they were searched. Captain MacMahon held another search on the road and this report was proved to be correct. XXIV. M?. Roever, who was formerly “ Vice-Consul** (German) and in charge of the Bank during the German’s regime and whose assistance had been required in connection with the affairs of the Bank, had been imprisoned in the Consulate up to Xmas and then be was allowed to return to his own home where he remained at liberty until the day of the departure of the prisoners, when he joined them just before starting and accompanied them to Ispahan. XXV. After the departure of the German and Austrian prisoners the Governor-General was most anxious to again take over charge of the Ark with the Turkish, Afghan and Persian prisoners which was permitted. XXVI. The following day the Afghan prisoners were sent to Lingah under a Persian guard and on the 22nd Turks &amp;nd Persians (except the Rermanisj left foi' Ispahan under the charge ol the (governor-General’s men.The arrangements for the disposal of the Afghan and Turkish prisoners were made by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul with the Governor-General. The former stated that the Afghans were not soldiers and were of no importance. XXVII. Shortly after the departure of the party reports were received from various sources that an attempt at rescue might be tried and the Consul- i at is P aha 1 n 1 rec eived similar news. Precautions were taken and Captain MacMahon was able to hand over his charge at Kumishah on 7th March havin°* had no incident on the march except at Yezd-i-Khast when one of the rooms m which the prisoners were caught fire during the night hut, thanks to his skilful management, no untoward event occurred. XXVIII. Arrangements have been made for the removal of Dr. Cturias and Austrian soldiers Pajork, Crup and Domandskive from Sirian to Bunder Abbas. XXIX. At present, as far as is known, the only enemy subjects in !Fars are Wassmuss at Abram, Obeidulla, Bruggmann and two Austrians (one of whom is reported to have died) near Darab. Mrs. Boever at Shiraz. XXX. It is also reported that the following are at Kermanshah and on the Turkish frontier Oskar Neidermeyer, Seiler and P. Paschen.

Telegram (Ordinary), No. 98, dated the 23rd March 1917. From— Captain E. Noel, Basrah, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran (repeated Ispahan and Basrah). In my telegram No. 1, I mentioned that presence of our troops at the fields and new position at Shushtar and Dizful had aroused considerable resentment. I had hopes, however, that present tribal Governors would be ready to take a strong line and override any opposition. They however on their arrival in low country adopted opposite attitude. On seeing with their own eyes the actual position only rumours of which had so tar reached them their friendly attitude definitely turned to one of suspicion and they proved sour and intractable to deal with. Change made it self felt in their holding up specie caravan for three weeks and by their raising tolls on Lynch road from Krs. 5 to 8 without consulting us. This change of attitude is due primarily to the financial losses which have resulted from the administrative measures adopted by us during the summer at Dizful and Shushtar and the elimination of their influence in these towns, which we have hitherto tacitly recognized and the substitution for it of local autonomy backed by British influence.V r - \ 7 ) The Klians who have been badly bit from all sides recently have hitherto been under the impression that the process of elimination had definitely ceased with the loss of Ispahan. * J I have visited both Dizful and Shushtar in company with the Sard a r Zatai, and alter full examination of the situation see little chance of restoring* my former friendly relations with the present Ilkhani or Ilbegi without making concessions in regard to the administration of these towns which X understand are not in present circumstances practicable or expedient. This being so it seems to me that the most promising solution would be to make a fresh start with a new Ilkhani and Ilbegi who in return for their nomination would accept substantially the present status quo, which incidentally might he modified in their favour in some respects if they were frankly co-operating with us. Several matters of importance are pending in Bakhtiari territory, e.g. t I Jb, construction of road, erection of telegraph line, raising Bakhtiari levies and I any concession such as withdrawal of troops from the fields or inclusion of ‘ Ramuz or Shushtar in Bakhtiari that we may be able to make in North Arabistan to a friendly Ilkhani might advantageously be conceded in exchange for a favourable agreement in regard to the above matters. The proposal which I now submit for consideration is that Sardar Zafac he nominated for the llkhaniship, in place of Sardar Muhtashim. Though the loyalty of the latter to our cause has been unexceptionable and his services of value, his usefulness has diminished in view of recent developments in Mesopotamia : his weakness of-character has always been notorious and it is now clearly demonstrated by his failure to face the logical consequences of his friendship with us. He himself is weary of office add would willingly act on a hint to resign. Sardar Zafar is a strong man with great influence in the tribe. He is ready to co-operate wholeheartedly with us and the salutary lesson he learnt at Kerman has not been wasted on him. He has come to a full agreement with the Shaikh of Mohammerah on all outstanding Bakhtiari Arab questions and his appointment would be warmly welcomed by the latter as he is ready as a guarantee of good faith to send his favourite son Amir Hussain Khan to Mohamerah or Tehran and to embody in an agreement with us the essential points of the understanding he has come to with the Shaikh. For the Ilbegiship there are only two possible candidates, Sardar Jang and Sardar Ashja. I should view the former’s appointment with the greatest misoivin 0 * * from recent letters of his w T hich I have seen it is cleai he is, quite unable to’change his Islamic spots and that he views recent increase of British influence in North Arabistan with liveliest resentment. Shaikh moreover has expressed opinion that his appointment would inevi tably lead to friction and trouble in Bakhtiari Arab questions. I share in a large measure your objections to Sardar Ashja, but I would submit that his inaction at Ispahan was essentially due to his weakness of character; he will be a mere tool in Zafar’s hands, and the combination of the two, a strong Ilkhani and a weak Ilbegi is well calculated to mitigate the present pernicious system of dual control. I should be glad to know if above proposals have your general concur rence • if so I do not anticipate any difficulty about getting Muhtasham to resign. Zaiar is quite capable of dealing with Mujahid or any other malcon tent. Addressed Tehran; repeated Ispahan, Basrah, Noel. Enclosure No. 2. Telegram R., No. 99, dated the 23rd March 1917.

In the early part of 1916 when Sardar Zafar was Governor-General of Kerman he attacked and broke up tbe German Mission to the Amir of Afghan istan under Zugmeyer and Seiler, when it was on its way through the Kerman Province. Among the effects of the party which fell into Sardar Zafar’s hands was a German decoration said to have been sent by the German Emperor to the Amir. Sardar Zafar wishes to present this decoration as a personal gift to Sir Percy Cox, and with that object asks me to hand it over to you with tbe request that you will kindly arrange that it may be forwarded to Sir Percy Cox by the first safe opportunity.

Your telegram* 98. I cannot quite see the urgent necessity for change just now and your combination seems scarcely feasible. Your reasons are that Muhtasham resents existing state of things in North Arabistan and is intractable and that pending questions make it desirable to have regulations amenable to llkhani. As regards latter it is unlikely that two of the three questions will be seriously taken in hand immediately and as all three are advantageous to Khans the necessity for humouring them is not very obvious. Bemoval of the grievance as regards North Arabistan must depend on our military interests. If they admit of a partial reversion to old regime of Bakhtiari incompetency I would prefer to allow M. to profit by it, but if not it would be better to reserve the measure of elimination giving new llkhani a good start, /Sardav Zafar is I believe as well affected as any one else especially as we liave just paid him a round sum to go to India. But I have never heard of him before as being a strong character. On the contrary, his record shows him to he even more unstable than the run of the tribe and his family look on him as a bit of a lunatic. He makes fair promises with an eye to Ilkhaniship but he must at heart resent existing conditions as much as Muhtasham and though he might make a fair (?) he would soon be as difficult to manage as Muhtasham. As to Ashja, it seems early yet to condone his conduct at Ispahan where he unquestionably got his share of plunder from Imperial Bank of Persia. But apart from this his record has been consistently had. His Majesty’s Consul-General once had to remove him from Bakhtiari on account of his hostility to us. Would not Sardar Pateh he preferable ? Your proposal also savours something of old policy humouring Khans and in my opinion continuance of that policy will largely annul significance of capture of Baghdad in the eyes of Khans. lam therefore strongly in favour of keeping things as they are, but if you are already committed I will do what I can to arrange things here but Khans here who are just as sulky as are your friends and are secretly opposing our interests will welcome the opportunity of giving us trouble over a change.

I do not think I am inclined to humour unduly the Khan. In any case popular opinion here is that the expulsion of Sardar Zafar eonfiseation ot Amir Mujahid’s property, the loss of Shushtar and Dizful following on that of Ispahan, and presence of our troops at oil-fields haye completely humiliated Khans and tribesmen. Muhtasham has given out that he will resist new regime and by a succession of acts such as increase of tolls and published threats to close Lynch’s road if troops are not withdrawn he has associated himself with the policy of opposition to our interests.

You might if you think it desirable say that I will pay it to him myself pending recovery. Will not situation at oil-fields soon he safe enough to permit withdrawal of troops or some of them ? So far as my information goes Sardar Ashja’s share in loot consisted mainly in property belonging to Zil-es-Sultan and I hardly think enforcing restitution to His Imperial Highness would sooth Khans.

Establishment of a Republic in Persia is being talked about a good deal. The Shah is genuinely impressed with it and hopes to find salvation in giving way to every demand made by so-called democrats. At their instigation he has now informed Prime Minister that his Cabinet must either be reconstructed by the inclusion of Motesham-es-Sultaneh, Musteshar-ed-Dowleh and another pro- German in place of Sirdar Mansur, Eiruz Mirza and Kawam-ed-Dowleh or that he must resign. The reply of the Prime Minister was that he could not agree to such a change which would be strongly resented by two Legations, and that he declined to tender his resignation. I told him 1 quite agreed with his reply. It would be impossible for him to carry on his former policy with these new colleagues : with the Shah ? s support they would force him to make objectionable demands on us; if we refused them point blank, he would be accused of insincerity in presenting them, and we should be forced in to making concessions in order to keep him in office. His position would be in any case most humiliating. I was convinced however that the Shah attached some importance to His Highness’ retention and that it was foreign to His Majesty’s character to take ascertained that I could only regard such a change as indicating a departure from Persia’s declared policy of benevolent neutrality and as calculated to produce worst impression on His Majesty’s Government who might have to reconsider their attitude towards this country. Though the Prime Minister agreed, he is evidently convinced that hostile influences surrounding Shah will shortly bring about fail of Cabinet.

From— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Hon ble Mr. A. H. Grant, C.S.I., C.I.E , Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 774, dated 22nd April, regarding the proposals for restoring order in the Bushire Hinterland. In a telegram recently received from the Chief of the General Staff the General Officer Commanding here was asked to ascertain and telegraph my views on various points, the last of which was the probability of the Bashire- Shiraz road question “ settling itself ”. I beg to observe that the only way it can do this is by the hostile Khans ! obtaining their object, which is to receive no punishment for their past offences, to retain the power to fleece or detain caravans at will, and in short to remain masters of the situation on the road as they are at present. Since the Kazerun affair a large quantity of goods has been going to Shiraz via the Firuzabad route. This route of course is Zair Khidar’s happy hunting ground and he has no doubt made lots of money. Becently the Darya Begi called upon the headmen of the Baraki Ports to pay the revenue, and on their refusing to do so detained some of their boats. It may be mentioned en passant that these ports were formerly under the late Rais Ali of Dilwar and not under Zair Khidar at ail. On hearing of Darya Begi’s action Zair Khidar immediately seized 20 loaded camels out of a caravan belonging to Ziegler. Bater on he let them go on payment of a flue of 600 Tomans and wrote to Ziegler’s Manager telling him that this had been done. Subsequently Zair Khidar seized a large number of donkeys going up, which I believe are still detained. It results therefore that if the Governor does anything in Bushire which Zair Khidar does not fancy, he intends to take reprisals by seizing goods on the road. No doubt if the local police were to arrest a Tangistani murderer or thief, Zair Khidar would seize large quantities of merchandise, etc., in tie hope that the importunity of the owners would induce the Darya esi to release, or connive at the escape of, the criminal. In shoit h 0 overnor would not be able to call his soul his own. I attach a copy of a letter from 1.

CO py 0 f letters from the Guveinoi-Geneiui to the Darya Begi about Ghazanfar, which may be of interest to the Govern- ment of India.Unless, therefore, all these roads are closed, which would'cause great loss to merchants and much inconvenience and extra expense to our colony and the general public at Shiraz, the hostile Khans are in a position to dictate to the Governor, until they are brought to their senses. I submit that this can only be done by some outside agency. Time has shown that they will not mend their ways of their own free will. They have had plenty of time to do so since last August, when they were reported to be anxious tc make amends, but they have made no overtures to the Governor. Thev have not even offered to pay a portion of the revenue due from them to the Persian Government, but when asked to do so by the Governor under orders from the Governor'General have refused in the most truculent and insolent manner. As it has been decided that no operations are to be taken by British troops here, the only possible way of bringing these three Khans to their senses is, in mv opinion, by means of an expedition by the Darya Begi, and for this reason 1 have recommended this course, which I hope will have been approved before this letter arrives. A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. JUnclosure No. 1. Dated the 18th (received 22nd) March 1917. From —Zair Kbidar Baghaki, Ahram, To—His Excellency Darya Begi Sardar, Governor of the Gulf Ports, Dashti and &gt; Dashtistan, Bushire. After settling the affairs, I turned attention to chastising the Baraki delinquents, and with that end in view I proceeded to Baraki on the 4th Jamadi I (26th February) and arrangements were made for the welfare of the people and inhabitants. Two days ago you wrote a letter to the Kadkhudas of Khabidu and Bunju, threatening to seize and attach (their boats) forcibly. It seems to me that the trouble among- them will only revive. They have written me letters in contradictory sense. I could not suggest what reply they should send to Your Excellency’s bogus letter, and I wrote to them an evasive reply. I am sure that you are well aware of the savage disposition of the T mgistar.is; while this letter of Your Excellency’s is not on a par with your knowledge of affairs. It is obvious that if the Tangistanis were not afraid of the bark of my rifle, they would take to cannibalism. Your Excellency has been to Tangistan se 'eral times with the Government forces, set fire to a few houses, and not returned half w T ay to your camp before they were more mischievous and bolder than ever. J have tried to kill them off, and little by little forced them to give up their barbarous practices. Now that they are falling hack into their wild ways and I am trying to stop them, you out of pure obstinacy and spite are obstructing the establish ment of order. What is the good of creating disturbances ? What right have you to interfere in my affairs and molest people?. If you are at enmity with me, only, why should you trouble poor subjects ? I promise not to demand any protection fees from the people of Tangistan on condition that you will not hold the Tangistanis responsible for the safety of inoffensive people. If I with my 100 followers, and you with that great force which you have in view, commence hostilities with each other, what mischief you will make and ruin a few poverty-stricken fellows whose condition should stir to pity the most obdurate heart. -‘ The more ruthless thou art, the morel twL Ld S tren^h Ca Pn , to y our cruel ty God will increase our committed^ WhL F . or th ® rest &gt; my dear Sxr, what unlawful deed have I 1 ' t Wh ]aave 1 usurped ?

Letter from Zair Khidar Baghaki Abram (in his own handwriting) to the Khadkhudas of Baraki Ports, Tangistan, undated (enclosed in the Kadkhudas' letter of £3rd March 1917) received 24th March 19l7. To all the Kadkhudas of Baraki ! Oh you, sons of burnt fathers, by what authority do you pay any attention to that flatulent Darya Begi ? At Bushire Darya Begi is not strong enough to appoint or dismiss even a coolie’s son’; how can he fine you ? If he is able to destroy one of your boats, 1 am ready to bum 50 Bushire boats in a single night. If you desire to marry another husband (serve another master) you had better quit my house (district), and get into any grave you like (go anywhere you like). If you act otherwise, I will send a number of the Shemsiris to shoot down your wives and children, and burn your houses, and they will not spare even your old and blind men. Bast year I feared God and had mercy on you and did not take any steps to molest you. Though Gkolam Ali (Kadkhuda of Bulkhair) cringed (to the British) and presented (their ships with) sheep, and I became aware of this, yet I overlooked the offence, with a view to leaving you in peace and safety. Oh you bastards, you are mistaken. If I cannot capture the villages of others I can at least by the grace of God defend my own. You had better stop this devilry, and not talk about being fined or paying the revenue, and thus expose yourselves to danger. If you do not remit me the balance revenue I will burn your fathers.

No. 7166, dated the 2lst Jamadi I 1365 [15th March (received 17th April) 1917]. From His Royal Highness Prince Farman Farma, Governor-General of Ears and the Gulf Ports, Shiraz, To— His Excellency Darya Begi, Governor of the Gulf Ports and Dashti and Dashtistan, Bushire. According to a report received, Your Excellency has called upon Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh to send in the revenue, and he has replied that the Swedes had fixed a salary for him and that, as the salary was not paid in full, he had appropriated for himself the State revenue in payment of the salary fixed by the Swedes. You should send this letter of mine in original, or a copy thereof, to him, so that he may know that he can have a salary, or live at Burazjun, only when he is servant of the Persian Government. He is a subject of 'Wassmuss and should ask him to pay him his salary. You can only tell him that the life of their refusal to pay revenue, and of the other doings of the Dashtistanis and Tangistanis, will not last another four or five months. Parman Parma. Enclosure No. 4. No. 7168, dated the 21st Jamadi I 1335 [15th March (received 17th April) 1917]. From—His Royal Highness Prince Farman Farm a, Governor-General of Ears and the Gulf Ports, Shiraz, To —His Excellency Darya Begi, Governor of the Gulf Ports aiid Dashti and Dashtistani, Bushire. I have written and am sending herewith the order you wished to he issued to Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh in connection with the revenue of Burazjun. I have also written a long separate letter. If you deem it advisable you can# after consulting the Deputy of the Consul-General, take a copy of it and send it to Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh through any one, who is in relations with him. Enclosure No. 5. No. 7169, dated the 21st Jamadi I 1335 [15th March (received 17th April) 1917]. From— His Royal Highness Prince Farman Farma, Governor-General of Pars and the Gulf Ports, Shiraz, To—His Excellency Darya Begi, Governor of the Gulf Ports, Dashti and Dash tistani, Bushire. Among the reports on the situation in those parts, you had sent me a report stating that Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh corresponds with you, and manifests his desire to serve the Government and the Governor-General. This favour able report has not been justified by any action on his part up to now, and it appears to me contrary to the facts. While we were in Tehran, we made enquiries, in the course of conversation, from the persons who were well informed of affairs in and possessed knowledge of the districts of Dashti and Dashtistan, and they communicated their information to us. Among others they said that Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh was a competent person, and in particular a good letter-writer. In view of our former acquaintance with his late father, Mirza Husain Khan, we were sure that he was by birth an intelligent and sensible person, and accordingly I sent a telegram to him from Tehran. Shortly after our arrival also, we sent every recommendation to you in his favour. The letters which we received from him all contained assurances that he would restore order in Borazjun, etc., and carry out our orders. We on our part in view of our past relations with his father intended to make an arrange ment, and try to include him in the persons v ho have been forgiven, so that the British authorities might overlook his actions in the past and he might po-operate and conform to the exigencies of the present regime.In conclusion, I write that you should write to Ghazanfar-us-SuItaneh in plain language that he should send in the revenue in full from the date we were appointed the Governor-General of Ifars. I he life of the rule of certain Khans of Dashtistan and Tangistan is, I think, coming to an end. 139 No. C.-12, dated Meshed, the 22nd March (received 27th April) 1917 (Confidential). from Lieutenant-Colonel W.

I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter No. T. C.-6, with enclosures, which I have addressed to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran. 2. The vernacular letters referred to in the enclosures have been sent to* him as some of them may he useful in helping to trace the persons mentioned in letter D.

G.-6, dated Meshed, the 21st March 1917 (Confidential). p rom Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. Grey, His Britannic Majesty's Consul- General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan, To—S ir Charles M. Marling, K.C.M.G., C B., His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, Tehran. I have the honour to refer to this office diary No. 1* for the week ending * Notes Persia Series Part xn. vide also Colonel 6th January last, paragraph 29, in which Eedi’s summary No. i in ibid. . it was stated that one Haji Ghulam Husain, a traveller from Herat to Meshed, had been arrested by our Agent at Karez hearing letters written in invisible ink incriminating Haji Mahmud, a H erati refugee and trader of Meshed, in a plot to arrange for the conveyance to Persia of some members of the German and Indian parties at Herat. 2. It was known that personal enmity existed between Mirza Hassan Khan, then our Karez Agent, and this Haji Mahmud, and any reports of the former in which the latter is mentioned have for some time been regarded with suspicion. As a precautionary measure, however, and in consideration of the fact that Haji Mahmud was believed to he connected with arms traffic, lie with his relatives mentioned in the diary referred to were arrested and released on hail. On the arrival here of Haji Ghulam Husain enquiry was made. The following documents are attached:— (1) The statement of our Agent, Mirza Hassan Khan. (2) The statement of Haji Ghulam Husain. This man gave a good impression when giving evidence : he is a man of good repute in Herat: and his conduct after return to Herat as reported by our Agent there, together with the fact that he refused know ingly to be a messenger for the German party, adds weight to his evidence. (3) The statement of one Saiyid Husain Shah to whom the letter marked B is addressed. This person also gave his evidence in a straightforward manner, and his statement that he had come here merely for pilgrimage has been attested by private information ^■■mniim&gt;asaGaaami — (4) Vernacular letters marked A to E witk translations where necessary. Kone is appended of letter A : that being a perfectly harmless document. Both evidence and probability point to letter B having left Herat in an envelope of its own ; while expert evidence as well as the general appearance of the document suggests its having been tampered with. It is unlikely that a statement of instructions would accompany a blank paper bearing writing in invisible ink. (5) The statement of an expert in vernacular writings. 4. The document alluded to in the evidence as F was a list, in English, of medicines required by the doctor at Herat This was returned to the messenger, who purchased and took them back with him to Herat. 5. It has been found that Mirza Hassin Khan, who was already known to Be an expert forger, was in possession of the necessary articles for writing in invisible ink which he used recently as a means for extorting money imm an innocent person. In this case also Haji Mahmud’s name was coupled with that of the Germans, and I regard this discovery as proving conclusively that letter *0 and the invisible writing on letter E are also forgeries. 6. It may he remarked that in the earlier stages of this enquiry, whir!), lias of necessity been prolonged, I had some difficulty in keeping the hands of the impetuous Russian Military party from the throat of the unfortunate Haji Mahmud. 7. A copy of this letter and its enclosures, minus the vernacular letters is being forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. 1. Statement of Mirza Hassan Khan, British Agent at Karez. Which of these letters do you recognise ? J, All. i sentXm off by to Meshed, Meshed, 9th January 1917. Before me W.H. Grey,2. Statement of Haji Glmlara Husain, I am a chemist by trade and reside at Herat. Sometimes I come to Meshed for trading purposes. I left Herat on 27th Safar to come hither, and the following documents were given to me by the persons stated:— (1) Letter (marked A) fastened and sealed in its envelope written by Abdul Husain (a reputable person of Herat well-known to this Consulate) and addressed to Mirza Abdul Rahim of Saadabad (a relative of Haji Mahmud). This vas given to me by Abdul Husain himself. (2) Letter marked B. This also was in its envelope, fastened and sealed, addressed to Mirza Husain Shah Khan, Meshed. It was given to me by the writer Muhammad Taqi: I recognise the writing as being his which I know j and I also believe the P. S. to be in his handuHting. (3) Letters marked I) and E. These were given to me by a woman of my establishment just when I was on the point of setting off. She stated that a woman of Gazergah Shrine had given it to her: this is a place about half a farsakh from Herat which is much frequented by the German party in Herat. These iwo letters are in one handwriting, but I do not know the writer. (4) The English paper, marked E, which was given to me by the doctor in Herat. Saiyid Riza, the servant of an Austrian in Herat, asked me to take letters for him, enquiring about Paschen, bur, I declined. I reached Karez on the 1st Rabi-ul-Awwal and went straight to the Customs Office. There I was searched with all my effects, and Eaqir Muham mad S^iltan, Naib-ul-Hukumah of Karez, took all my letters from me, including those mentioned above. The letters marked D and E were in a kharita in the saddle bag, into which my wife had put it Mhen I was about to start on my journey. Eaqir Muhammad Sultan gave my papers to the British Agent when he returned to Karez. After six days I was allowed to go on to Meshed by Sultan and the British Agent, who told me that some letters connected with Germans had been found among my papers, and that they M'ould send me in charge of sowais. I had no idea that any of the covers or letters contained anything incriminating or I would not have brought them. Meshed, 9th January 1917* Before me W. G. Guest. 3. Statement of Saiyid Husain Shah, The letfer on blue paper shewn to me (marked B) is addressed to me. The Mnter is Mir Muhammad Taqi of Herat, my cousin, who is a doctor by p'ofession. The majority of the letter is genuine, but parts of Ai appear to have been rubbed out and other matter inserted in their place. I have spent all my life in Herat, having been born there. I only came to Meshed about 2^ months ago. This is the first letter 1 have received from my cousin since my arrival. 1 came to Meshed only for pilgrimage and had no intention originally of remaining for more than*2 months. I am a trader in Herat and have no dealings with Meshed; (At this point the witness is asked what portions of the letter he considers are not genuine. He points them our,: they coincide M’ith those pronounced to be in a different hand by the experr,, subsequently.) (Marked in red.) The reference to guns in letter B may refer to cartridges which my cousin wishes me to get for his sporting gun, a twelve-bore; as the cases are sold in the bazar here : but I have no idea who the “ Haji Sahib ” is to w hom this portion of the letter alludes, and therefore think that it is not genuine. Moreover, it appears to be written with a thicker pen on a wet ground, which leads me to think that my cousin’s writing there has been erased by licking the-31 ^aper aad tlus piece written in its place. (The witness licks a piece clean ) I' regard to the P. S., I can only say that it is not my cousin’s writing at all and that We ha\e no connection with Saiyid Riza. ° * Meshed, 9th January 1917, Before me W. G. Grey. A.—This is an ordinary letter to a friend, about one lor Saiyhl Husain Shah being enclosed. It says nothing whatever B.—From Mir Muhammad Taqi to Husain Shah Khan. Usual compliments.. I have no news of you for a long time, you have not written io me since leaving. I would much like to hear from you since news brings solace to those enduring separation. Please break silence and write to me. Thank God for your safe arrival in Meshed and for your pilgrimage. But the pilgrimage should not make you forget us. Do not omit to get for me in Meshed the few things I asked you to buy. I told a mutual friend there to buy forHaji Sahib at Herat fifteen twelve-bore cartridges : he will give them to you and you should send them by some Herati muleteer whom I myself will give a reward. Please expedite this, you know how badly they are required. (Returns to compliments and good wishes, referring to addressee having recently been married in Meshed.) i And as to the things referred to above, they are for a twelve bore. I have given the money to Haji Ghulam Hussain, the chemist. Please buy | them and send them at once. Post Script .—Brother, the white paper which is in the evelope when put close to the fire will disclose: writing having read it you will know what I want. ' C.—Written in invisible ink. Tell Haji Mahmud Agha that reference has been made to Kabul con cerning Karez affairs, that he may be composed in mind. The Maulvi Barkat- ullah and the doctor have given a list of articles that you should get, and send at once. Send your carriage to Saadabad, so that having come to Dagharan on the night appointed it may bring at night secretly those persons to Saadabad and thence to Meshed, and take them to your house. You will not fail to perform your work in connection with Karez affairs ; the people there are greatly interfering with us. Saivid Riza. D.— Instructions for Haji Ghulam Husain. When you arrive safely in Khorasan I beg yon kindly to place my letter (that marked E) in an envelope and address it to Tehran, to Ustad Khali Snbay living at the end of the Small Char Suq, who will give it to ISasmllah Haji, who will send it to Ispahan to my brother Haidar Hajt Ah Muhammad. Certainly you will not fail. (No signature, but probably written by Saiyid Riza.) E.—Anonymous. If TOP are good enough to enquire after me I am well and in Herat on fhursdav. 18th Safar.

At tlie time of writing we are busy with our affairs, and are doing well, still living with Agha Karim. We are anx.ous however to see you, since separation from relatives is very hard May God terminate the days Of separation of all the faithful, and especially of you and ourselves. ^ (The letter ends with salutations to various friends not mentioned by name, and the name of the addressee is not given ) Between the lines in invisible ink. To Haji Muhammad Taqi, Ispahan. I am waiting for news from you. The Chief (Wagner?) asks you to send Tehran news at once through Haji Mahmud as before. Address to Haji Mahmud, Caravanserai Uzbuk at Meshed, and he will forward to us. If you or No. 4 wish to come, go to Haji Mahmud and he will send you to Herat. The Chief also wishes to go secretly to Meshed and thence to Ispahan, but is waiting for news of the Turkish troops and their affairs. You should send news at once. I wished to come some time since but became ill and was prevented: now coming is difficult. Without fail send news by post as before, or send No. 4, to give us correct information. Saiyid Riza. &amp;. Statement of Agha Sani-ut-Taulia, expert in caligraphy. I have inspected the letter marked B, and find that it has been wrilteu bv at least two persons. One is really a good scribe, but the writing of the other or others is immature. The two pieces on the hack of the letter, one of which is put in as a P. S., I do not believe to have been written by the original writer, thev are too well-written. (The witness points out the portions in r the margins which he believes to have been altered, and upon examination the traces of writing appear below that now existing in places, which writing was imperfectly erased when the passages were altered.) Letter C and that portion of E which is in ivisible ink were evidently written by. the same person. I notice that in letter E the ^ invisible ink portion is written m Persian handwriting, whereas the other is in the hand of an Afghan. Before me Meshed, 9th January 1917. W. G.

The Begular Infantry that would garrison Khwash would continue under the orders of the senior military officer, and would be solely for the purpose of affording support to the Political Officer should need arise/ The reduction proposed would necessitate arrangements for the disposal of surplus stores of the Ordnance, Supply and Transport and Medical Depart ments. Surpluses of the first and last will be required ultimately by the Consul and Political Agent Sarhad. These two officers would probably be in a position to take over the hulk of the ration articles. Under existing orders, men and animals returning to India from this force are rationed by me to Dalbandin, consequently the surplus rations would probably not be very large. The motors allotted to this force are more than would be necessary for the reduced force. It might be desirable to retain at Kacha a Vulcan Ambulance and one Hupmobile. Owing to the large area garrisoned by the Sistani Levy Corps, I would suggest that one other Hupmobile be handed over to the Officer Commanding Corps, and the remaining cars returned to Nushki. Under existing conditions of travel, it takes the Officer Commanding, Sistani Levy Corps, about three months to tour round all his posts. The retention of any motors out here will necessitate British drivers, for the reason that Indian drivers have been found to be incompetent and unreli able. The administration of the reduced force would presumably devolve on the General Officer Commanding, 4th Quetta Division. 155 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7030, dated the 14th May 1917.)

Shah has been so impressed by firmness displayed hy Prime Minister together with spontaneous demonstration of Tehranis* in his favour that he has requested him to retain office for the present. In spite of internal dissension Cabinet’s position seems comparatively safe. Shah and his democrat friends are now urging a number of changes in provincial governorships in north partly on account of money to be made and partly with a view to influencing election. Prime Minister hopes that this opportunity may he utilised to remove one or two of his most redoubtable opponents by giving them provincial appointments. Shah and Bakhtiaris are making great efforts to remove Akhar from Ispahan and. as Cabinet is aware that Russian Charge d’Affaires’ support is given without instructions from Pe’rograd they may possibly give way, my advice to stand firm notwithstand ing.

From— Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, To—The Hon'ble Mr. A. H. Grant, C.S.L, C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to address you on the subject of the German, Austiian, Swedes, Turk and Afghan prisoners, who were imprisoned in the Shiraz Ark W r hen the column reached Shiraz. 2. The first idea was for the column to take over these prisoners at that time in charge of the Kawam, and a search was made for suitable quarters. It was however found that, without electric light and barbed wire, no Persian house would be suitable for the purpose. The Farman Parma was strongly opposed to our taking over the prisoners in the Ark as it would lessen his prestige, and while the matter was being discussed, the Persian Govern ment intervened and insisted on his taking them over himself As our force diminished by attrition, was numerically very weak, I was glad to be relieved of a task which would have rendered the entire column immobile. 3 Early in January it was decided that it was desirable to send away the prisoners. The Earman Earma, although most anxious to be relieved of the prisoners, was eouallv anxious to avoid all responsibility in the matter, an anxiety whie i was shared^to the full by the Persian Government. As the season for theiif; 'i 1 t f: 4 ■ B i ll, f'l fll .. ; fjr ! i: i|| i If- ! If? MM If I tribal movements was approaching, Colonel Gough and I finally informed His Highness that on a certain date 1 should take over the prisoners. At first the Harman Parma was much upset but a happy formula was finally discovered. My functions are dual and as head of the “Amnia”, I received an official letter from His Highness to the effect that the prisoners should be sent to Ispahan and that I was responsible. To this I replied accepting the task and the responsibility. 4. Russian co-operation was arranged for by His Majesty’s Consul- General, Ispahan, and readily given. After some discussion it was decided that the prisoners should be taken over at Kumishah. 5. The question of ways and means presented considerable difficulties. A powerful escort was essential both to prevent a rescue on the road which would almost certainly have been attempted had it been practicable, and also to furnish the necessary guards. It was evident that in Persian houses or caravanserais it would be impos sible to guard prisoners effectually in the ordinary manner, and that it was either a case of accepting the parole of the officers (the only important element) or of ironing all ranks. After a reference to the Chief of the General Staff, the latter course was adopted. Carriages were arranged for the officers and for the men Kajavas or wooden cages placed on mules in pairs. It did not .seem fair to expect them to walk ; and Kajavas are very difficult to get out of quickly which was a point in their favour. The question of supplies and transport was also arranged not without difficulty. 6. The prisoners were taken over on February 12th in the Ark and were informed by me that by the orders of the Persian Government they were being sent to Ispahan. Dr. Zugmeyer, who was their spokesman, after a formal protest made various reasonable requests. I took care not to inform the prisoners that they would be handed over to the Russians, as that would have produced a feeling of despair among them. They were however informed the day before starting that upon any attempt to escape they would be shot and that they would be ironed whenever the Officer Commanding the escort considered it necessary. 7. On February 17th the prisoners started for Ispahan. I met them outside the town and Zugmeyer protested against the ironing, but I said that I considered it necessary owing to the lack of suitable accomodation. Dr. Zugmeyer acknowledged that in every other way the arrangements made were satisfactory. 8. Captain Macmahon, 124th Baluchistan Infantry, commanded an escort of 200 rifles and 22 sabres of the 15th Bengal Lancers. He was met by Captain Lilly with a squadron of the South Persia Rifles from Abadeh south of Dehbid and to Rumishah the squadron scouted well ahead of the main body. By my instructions the force moved rapidly, both to lessen risk of attack and also to decrease the number of nights the prisoners had to be guarded. There were rumours of an attack by Bakhtiaris, which was quite a possibility and accordingly beyond Abadeh the prisoners were handcuffed by day. Through out they were ironed from sunset to sunrise. The Russians sent patrols towards Pura Dumba to lessen the chances of Bakhtiari activity and it was given out that in case of a rescue being likely to be successful, the prisoners would be shot. On March 6th the Russian escort was met one stage south of Kumishah and on the following day all the German and Austrian prisoners, forty-five in number, were handed over to the Russian escort. I subsequently received a telegram from the Russian Commandant at Ispahan expressing his appreciation of the courteous and obliging manner in which Captain Macmahon had behaved towards the Russian escort. I con sider that Captain Macmahon has carried through with credit a difficult and disagreeable task. 9. Of the other prisoners, the Turks (none of whom were officers), were taken up by a party of the Farman Parma’s men, together with the Persian officers of the Gendarmerie who had been imprisoned in the Ark. They were also safely handed over to the Russian escort. r Ifiil ft! !Af |' mns ’ nor ' e of whom, according to His Maiesty’s Consul were sol lers or of any importance were despatched by Colonel Gough to Lin»ah 10. The departure from Shiraz of the above prisoners has removed the chief source of anxiety as the prisoners were the focus of a stmn ' anti? mismmed r tT ag d nda whlc ^ . the y were i oined by the anarchist ° party, Persi??? aM democrats, and by certain officers of the Gendarmerie and lersian Army. The fact that the prisoners were taken over by us and safely handed over to the Russians has produced a favourable political impression. ,,, . r n v „ Co P ie8 of th, ' s lpf t pr are being sent to His Majesty’s Minister, the Chief of the General Staff Sir Percy Cox, the Deputy Resident, and His Majesty s Consul-General, Ispahan, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz. 164 No. 553, dated Shiraz, the 9th—11th April (received 11 th May) 1917 .

Such reply as was befitting has already been despatched to the Legation concerned. Through this telegram Yottr Highness is permitted to acknowledge General Sir Percy Sykes as Head of the Forces which he has organised and to give him the necessary support whenever be needs it. You may, especially from my part, remind* him that the Ministers of Srate expect that the high expectation raised on account of the capacity and ability displayed during the period he has been in Persia, may he fulfilled so as to give satislaction to the Ministers of State.

But (he added) Governor-General could not hold direct communication with Kurdistani, he declined to receive his letters, he preferred to work through Kurdistani’s assistant. At once I counselled Kurdistani to accept this arrangement and do what he could to make it work as a temporary measure. Kurdistani promised to do this but yet I fear that by this method we arrive at no permanent solution. Moreover in the event of the Governor-General and the Persian Govern ment commencing to work against Sirdar fsusrat and his family, I shall not be inclined to intervene.

Last named called on me also and was very optimistic. From what his assistant had gleaned Governor-General distrusts Ihtisham who is still in league with S. Nusrat.

Also I am sending you by post copies of correspondence referred to with Minister. Enclosure No. 5. Diary, paragraph 10 (week ending the lith February 1917). An awkward revenue case has come up in which Russian “ interests” are involved. The bankrupt firm of Jehanian owned some land in Khabis The revenue due on the property came under revision in 1913, the question being the conversion rates lor revenue payable in kind. In the “title deeds (said to be a firman from the Shah) the rate was fixed at tomans 2 per kharwar, but according to Kurdistani these imaginary rates in such cases were abolished by the legislation of the National Majlis. Lecoffre was unable to extract the full market value, but a compromise was reached by which Jehanian instead of paying for 328 kharwars at 2 tomans per kharwar, or tomans 656, in all, were to pay for 288 kharwars in all, at the rate of tomans 16 per kharwar for ld4 kharwars and tomans 4^ per kharwar for the remaining 144. Last year Jehanian transferred the property to Mirza Buzurg, Russian Agent at Yezd, who now claims the right to pay at the 2 tomans rare fixed in the sanad. It is stated, probably with truth, that the transfer was made solely with a view to bringing in Russian influence to prevent the increased Revenue demand being enforced, and that the transfer is not a bond fide one. It is also stated that the Russian side of the case is really being pushed by the Mirza in the Russian Consulate-General in Ispahan.Kurdistan!, whose instructions from Tr Ii7 c' consulted His Majesty’s Consul, who ba8 o s r u S|^f tonerty s and whai s^rst — »= ‘a :. r oX u. — s,r;v ;?d ss xszi u -*-* ** -*»*. ^ rate camed in tlie firman. Enclosure No. 6. Paragraph 7? (week ending the Bth March 1917). His Maiestv’s Consul called on the Sardar Nusrat and Kurdistani on 28th rebmary wUh a view to ascertaining the facts regarding the taxation of the Par man Parma’s property. The Sardar Nusrat mentioned only the question of the demand assessed on /. i • '■iomp time a°o Kurdistani received orders from the Ve-shm Government to collect the value of all revenue in kind, commuting it a t current market rates. He protested, but the orders were repeated three times and he had eventually to notify all revenue-payers “^f n9 r Forman Parma. The current market ^alue is not less than lb tomans per k bar war while by the compromise agreed to as the result of agitation some tears ago the rati now paid vary from 4 to 7 tomans per kharwar, according lo the remoteness or propinquity of the land in relation to a favourable market His Majesty’s Consul is informed that the increase which won f.r, — d._»d »d it is obviously necessary to have one rule for all, rich or poor. The Persian Government has notified and Parman Taima has been informed, that a month’s delay has been granted in bis case. Ibis is doubtless to allow of negotiations in Tehran. Enclosure No. 7. Paragraph 93 (week ending 12th March 1917). The Jehawian-Mirza Buzurg Jteverme Case remains in an undetermined ai d eiitual Hate. It is a question of whether the Revenue Department is to make a reimbursement of revenue, as what has been already collecte exceeds what car be demanded in accordance with the terms of^ the firman As the Russian Consul-General at Ispahan recently telegraphed m favour ot Mivza Buzurg direct to the Governor-General, Kerman, His Majesty s Consul suggested to His Majesty’s Minister that the ease, which is a very important one from many points of view, should be taken up and discussed by toe two Legations in‘Tehran. His Majesty’s Minister has replied that the Russian Charge d’Affaires has informed him that Russian interests m Kerman are m ’har^e of His Majesty’s Consul and are directed, not by the Consul-General n ]spal aa, but by the Russian Legation. His Majesty’s Consul has been able to see no reason why the property in question should be treated dmetentiy from similar properties belli by non-Russian proteges; nor why, after paying enl anced rates while in Jehanian’s hands for three years it should now only be Charged at the rules laid down in the firman, when all similar firmans Have been overridden. ^181 Ttfo. 28 j-S M dated Busliire, the 7th (received 14th) 1917.

According to a Reuter’s telegram, there has been a great revolution in Russia The Russian people have all revolted against their Emperor saying that their interests lie in making peace with Germany, and ceasing to fight. The Emperor addressed a speech to his people saying “ At this time when famine has spread all over the country, which is grappling with a strong foe like Germany, it is unjustifiable for the nation to take such a step ” Severe fighting took place at last between the people and a Government force result ing in terrible bloodshed, and the final victory of the people over the Emperor. They deposed him from the throne, and made his cousin the Emperor of all the Russian dominion. This news shows that German troops have advanced further on Russian soil, and occupied more places than we know, and as for the last two months we have not received any information about the war in Europe, and news has ceased to reach us it cannot be said that only the occupation of Poland by Germany has caused the nation to rise against the Government and wish for peace, because Poland was occupied by the Germans two years ago, and if this was the cause of the revolution, the people would have revolted during the past two years. It is, therefore, presumable that the movement on the part of the people and their desire for peace are the result of the occupation by the German tioops of Kieff and Odessa, because after the occupation of Poland and the disappearance of General Ealkenhayh most of the politicians believed that he would appear before Kiefi and Odessa. r I he importance of the occupation of Rieff and Odessa is well described in the e ‘ flabl-ul-M a tin , No. 8, and makes it clear that as soon as thev are taken,'the Black Sea will be open to Germany, and the Caucasus lost to Russia. I he Russian nation have not only understood the dangers of their enmity with Germany, hut have come to know of the injurious results of their friendship with England. I hey know, that all the ruin in their country and the bloodshed in the world are the result of the intmues of England. Now that their Emperor has been changed, and the Nationalists are in charge of affairs, it is believed that they will at once cease to fRht and agree to a separate peace. News has also been received that secret negotia tions for a separate peace are going on, and there is no doubt that, in the circumstances, Germany will attain its object, and that as soon as a separate pi^ace is concluded with the Russians, France will also follow suit and the business will be settled once ioi all.'— V '^ J - vu jJiusptjrity wui Decorae clear. Bushire. ot this news and as long as this news is not officially published, i.e., signed notices are not published officially by the British, we cannot believe what has been reported in the notices in question, particularly in view of the news which we are receiving by travellers about the fighting at Shayibieh and at Ctesiphon, and which clearly show that these notices are all false. Another fact, which renders the authenticity of the news doubtful, is the report contained in a teleeram, sent from the Commander-in-Chief* of the British forces to Bushire, which had been sent by/the British Residency to Husein Khan Dashti and which shows that owing to heavy rains the British troops have been able only to proceed a little beyond Kut-al-Amarah. To speak nothing of contradiction, even if we feel inclined to accept the report, it is not an extraordinary enterprise for the British Government, now that all the countries have to send troops to fight in many theatres of war all •over the world, to reach Baghdad after two years’ fighting, because it is easier for the British to send troops there and bring up supplies of stores than for the Turkish Grovernment to convey stores from Constantinople to Baghdad. The Turkish railway has not gone beyond Ras-ul-Ain, which is 195 farsakhs from Baghdad, while Basrah, which is almost adjoining London and India, is not more than 80 farsakhs from Baghdad. Purther, the fact that Turkish troops have evacuated Baghdad without fighting would show that it has been a military strategy and that they have a great object in view in another theatre of war. It is possible that the troops of the Allied (Triple) Governments have been engaged in the Kieff-Odessa region which will secure them a great success, and the British troops availing themselves of the opportunity have occupied Baghdad. As soon as the Allies can pay attention to Mesopotamia, the British will be besieged there at once. One important point that one can gather from these notices and which renders them liable to contradiction, is the fact that they report the evacua tion by the Turkish troops of Persian soil on the one hand, and the occupation (by the British troops) of Baqubah which is on the road to Khaniqin at the same time. They ought to have therefore published the news of the British and Russian troops joining hands. But this news has not yet been published, which shows that the notices are not free from exaggeration. For the last four days Reuter has been quite silent about Rus la although it had been reported formerly that German troops are advancing in all directions in Russia without fighting and the Russian troops suriendering without fighting. Later Reuter only stated that both the brother of the Russian Emperor and his nephew had refused to accept the sovereign y.p : % i'll V There is a rumour at Bushire that the Germans have occupied Petrograd and that the Russian Emperor has fled to Berlin. We do not know how far this news is true. A copy of an English newspaper which reached us recently, and the date f of which is before the Russian revolution, is full of the operations of German submarines and states that the British people find themselves m great danger, and say that they have only one enemy, and that is the submarine. It is reported that fighting is going on at Ctesiphon but we have no authentic information whether the British are still at Baghdad or aye left it. Letters from Bushire only say that the British will not accept letters or passengers for Baghdad. t I v ft i r* . jf ■ 183 L 1' Telegram P. } No. 184-F., dated (and received) the 24th May 1917.

Ministers state these crimes are arranged for by secret committee in pay of Shoa-es-Sultaneh, Haji Moina Tujjar and democrat leaders and that actual assassins are Caucasians and other anarchists from Russia, numbers of whom are known to have come to Persia.

Eollowing are terms arranged. Soulet is solely responsible for security for 3 months or longer if necessary of the road from Tang-i-Turkan to Dasht-i-Arjan inclusive (this includes the town of Kazerun). Soulet divides with South Persia Bifles responsibility for road from Dast-i-Arjan to Chenar Bahdar. Eor whole of above he is providing force of 450 men—cavalry and foot. lor this I have guaranteed to pay him sum of tomans 5,050 a month. Soulet has appointed Governor, Kazerun, for whom he is to be paid tomans 150 a month. Soulet guarantees Nasr-i-Divan will not set foot on Kazerun territory within 6 months. Mahomet Beza Khan “ Islah ” of Diris (Wassmuss right hand man) is to be either caught and given to us or expelled from vicinity of road for which Soulet is responsible. Soulet assures us of his perfect loyalty to Persian Government, Governor. General and ourselves and accepts responsibility for behaviour of his tribes men and for revenue due to Persian Government. I have guaranteed (with authority of Earman Earma) that so long as Soulet acts up to agreement we will assure him in his position as llkhani and have promised him our support in every way. Soulet is probably remaining in vicinity of road and is sending his son to Sarhad in charge of those tribes proceeding north.Sykes was with me and signed agreement with Soulet and myself. I believe we have won Soulet’s trust and confidence and that he will faithfully carry out his promises which should ensure security for more than half the distance to Bushire which would otherwise harbour rebels and encourage Wassmuss. It should also reduce chances of friction between Kashgais and generally improve our position in South Persia.

Views of Deputy Political Resident are as follows '.—Begins. On several occasions Darya Begi expressed the opinion that if assisted by us and with help of contingents from friendly Chiefs of JGayat Daud Rud Hilleh Shabankareh and Angali he might be able to deal with the hostile Khans of Chakutah, Tangistan and Rorasjun. Proposal was therefore put forward early in March (after intimation had been received from Minister that IVar Cabinet was not in favour of action by British troops) that he should be allowed to do so, the idea being that he should make his move at the same time that Soulat was dealing with Kazerun. He hoped to be able to raise eight or nine bundled armed^men. He has ammunition and asked only for financial assistance and loan of some guns and (maxim guns ?) with men to work them, bo far pro posal has not been put before friendly Chiefs, as Darya was unwilling to do so until assured of our assistance. Arrangements must be started immediately if anvthin 0 ' is to be done. In fact it is doubtful whether it is not already too late owing to difficulty of collecting men during harvest which commences beginning of May. There is nothing to show that situation on Shiraz road is clearing itself up. Ends. ^ • . Generally I am in agreement with these views, but think that it would be a great mistake for Darya to make a move unless there is good prospect of success as if it proved a falure it would have a very bad effect on local situation. I could lend him two Turkish l.-pr. guns and one 7-pr. mountain gun and two maxim guns with ammunition and detachments to work them if move is decided on. u* ; - V ! i| f 1 1' f A; i i ' L Telegram P., No. 493-S., dated the 20 th April 1917.

Your policy arrangements and distribution are entirely under Minister’s direction, under Secretary of State’s most recent orders, Government of India however offer following remarks. Object laid down in my telegram 289-S. of June 15th, 1916, still hold good, apparently. Maintenance of order and authority of Persian Government in South Persia is primary object of force. Though it is also intended to balance Russian Cossack force in North in its political effect and by the restoration of our prestige, there is no need for it to be formed on lines of a war division organized to act as such in the field. Number of 10,009 was fixed with reference to objects which force was intended to fulfil and to strength of corresponding force intended to be maintained by Russia in North Persia not with reference to any field army organization. Organization on following lines would seem suitable : (1) Division of South Persia into military districts of which four would appear suitable for present, viz., Pars, Gulf Ports, Kerman and Liiristan with headquarters at Shiraz, Rushire, Kerman and Bunder Abbas, respectively. (2) Maintenance of one or more well equipped movable columns of all arms in each district ready to suppress disorders threatening in any direction. (3) Maintenance of suitable garrisons at large towns and posts on main trade routes. These principles underlie your telegram 1116, dated 3rd December, 1916, apparently.

Please also see Eoreigm telegram No. 473-S. Our position is that British officers, British Instructors, arms and ammunition equipment and clothing for South Persia Rifles have just arrived on sufficient scale to enable real progress to begin in organisation and training of South Persia Rifles. It is, however, necessary to have detachments on certain main lines of communication towards for important convoys and towards sources of food supply. Thesedetachments at present include 2,000 South Persia Rifles who are not yet trained nor properly under influence of British ranks and so cannot be regarded as dependable. By utilizing Indian troops for this at Dehbid and Sirjan more South Persia Rifles cah be concentrated for training and equipment at Shiraz and Kerman and I regard this as very important in addition to reasons given in my previous telegram. If Indian battalion withdrawn, it will be great delay in progress of South Persia Rifles and would affect local opinion unfavourably. Parman Parma would especially demur. I leave relative disadvantages of retaining or withdrawing one battalion of Indian Infantry to your judgment. By early autumn it could be, so far as I can see, withdrawn. Consul, Shiraz, concurs.

(2) Short, stoutly built, fair man, known as the Naib-Consul. (3) Short stout man, spoken of as having worked in submarine factory.

We need not look on Southern Persia as likely to be materially affected by outside events I think unless there is complete disaster in Mesopotamia and in larger theatres o£ war also. Hence the only object you ne&amp;i have elaborated is the bringing of the Southern Persia llifles to a state of efficiency as quickly and as economically as possible. Task of Southern Persia Rifles is very much as you described, viz , the maintenance of order particularly on the main routes, the reduction to submis sion of refractory tribes and restoration of authority of Central Government m general. Our choice of any particular undertaking must, of course, be guided . by considerations of feasibility and importance. First in point of importance I should place opening of Bushire-Shiraz road, but as it is apparently beyond strength of Southern Persia Rifles at present your programme under (c) appears the most suitable as does aiso distribution of forces described in your telegram 583. Proposals under (d) hardly come within the Southern Persia Rifles and are scarcely to be regarded as within their scope excep m so aras is necessary to their own efficiency; I should also in anticipation substitute as regards local chiefs’ words “ As long as inevitable” for “ As far as possible .11,000 not 10,000 is the total strength of Southern Persia Rifles as contemplate agreement of August last.

With reference to my letter No. 257*0., dated 10th July 1916, reg ird- inr the steps taken by His Excellency the Darya Begi to punish the Shaikhs nho helped the murderers of Khan Bahadur Agha Bedr, I have the honour to state that the Kawam-ul-Mulk has recently paid a visit to the hinterland of the Shibkuh Ports and has upset the arrangements made at Ghiru. 2 1 be^ to enclose, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a despatch (No. 15—650, dated 29th March 1917, with enclosures) which I have addressed to His Majesty’s Minister on the subject. 3. The Kawam’s action seems most uncalled for, seeing that it was quite impossible for him to punish the offending Shaikhs in the first instance, and having regard to the fact that he owes his present position entirely to our assistance. I think that properly speaking serious notice should be taken of it, hut as it is necessary in the opinion of the British Authorities at Shiraz to conciliate the Kawam in the interests of position there, L have only suggested that he should refund the money taken from Shaikh Ibrahim and that the administration of the Shibkuh Ports should be transferred to the Gulf PorU Local Government. PRECIS. Shibkuh Forts .—Recent action by Kawan in, and necessity for, transfer of administration of district to Local Government of Gulf Ports* Enclosure.

Trevor, C.I.E., Acting Consul-General, To— Sir Charles Marling, K.C.M.G., C.B, His Britannic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, Tehran. I have the honour to address you on the subject of the action by the Kawam-ul-Mulk during a tour which he has recently made in the south of Laristan, and more especially in connection with its results in the region known as the “ Shibkuh Ports a coastal district lying west of Lingah between the ports of Hoghu on the east and Kangun on the west. In my weekly diaries (Nos. 26 and 27) during the end of June and th© beginning of July 1916, and in my monthly summary for June 1916, I reported Mrciii it» Slail ;or 4 twi laitil!40 fbe action which His Excellency the Darya Begi had taken with the assistance of H. M. ships to punish certain Shaikhs along the coast who had helped the murderers of the late Khan Bahadur Agha Bedr, Residency Agent at Lingah, * and his brothers. For convenience of reference I now beg to submit a copy of my letters, Nos. 221-C. and 257-C., dated 26th June 1916, and 10 th July 1916, to the Government of India, giving a detailed account of the proceedings of the Darya Begi and the Commodore. I regret that through an oversight copies of these letters were not sent to you at the time as should have been done al though the diaries ahovementioned contain most of the facts. I may mention that when His Excellency the Darya Begi told me that he had ascertained that the Shaikhs of Chiru, Shiwiih, Gaobandi and Galladar had helped the murderers, inspite of his orders for their arrest, I told him that I thought it essential that these Shaikhs should be taught a lesson, and asked whether he could do it and how. His Excellency replied that as there were two factions down the coast, one of which was composed of these guilty Shaikhs, he could easily punish them with the assistance of the opposing faction, which would supply land forces. The port* of Asalu, Nakhl-Taki, which had been usurped by the Khan of Galladar were in the Darya Begi’s own district, but the Shaikhs of Chiru and Gaobandi were nominally under the Governor-General of Ears and the Kawam in his capacity of Governor of Laristan. However, as at the moment Pars was in disorder and the Kawam only just able to carry on at Shiraz by the help of munitions and funds given by us, it was useless to ask him to do anything, and to do so would have caused great delay even if my letter had ever reached him. In the circumstances, I sked the Darya Begi to exact punishment from the offend ing Shaikhs, His Excellency agreed and said he would turn the Shaikh of Galladar out of Asalu and Nakhl-Taki, and Shaikhs Mazkur and Abdullah Obeidali from Shiwuh and Chiru. As shown in the two reports which are enclosed, the Darya Begi’s expedi tion was a complete success. One of the conditions made at the time by Darya Begi was the payment of revenue in full by the three loyal Shaikhs on account of the ports they held previously (when they were not paying it as they claimed that part of their districts were in the hands of their enemies) and on account of Chiru. Shaikh Ibrahim Hammadi paid 2,000 tomans for his Hammadi District and for Chiru to the Finance Department of the Gulf Ports Province. The other two Shaikhs also paid their revenue. The revenue collected from Shaikh Ibrahim Hammadi has been accounted for by the Finance Department at Bushire to the Finance Department at Shiraz, as duly received on account of Shiraz : the original receipt given to the Hammadi Shaikh. The effect of the joint expedition was most salutary along the whole coast: from July to January 1917 all went like clock work, order was main tained from Kan gun to Lingah and the loyal Shaikhs were perfectly able to j prevent any attack by the hostile faction, which with the exception of Shiwuh was cut off from access to the coast. This was useful in other ways, for it prevented Ali Akbar Khan, Galladari, and Shaikh Mazkur from the extensive smuggling by the ports they had held into their inland districts. In January Kawam-ul-Mulk began to send messages to Shaikh Ibrahim through Soulat-ul-Mulk of Bastak, to the effect that he was coming to Lar, etc., and the revenue for the past year should be paid to himself by Shaikh Ibrahim without delay. Shaikh Ibrahim referred to Bushire for orders and was told in reply that there was no cause for alarm and he should tell Kawam- ul-Mulk that he had already paid the revenue to Darya Begi. I had myself written to Kawam-ul-Mulk in December copy attached. explaining the circumstances and asking him not to worry Shaikh Ibrahim. In February more peremptory letters reached Shaikh Ibrahim from Kawam; Darya Begi wrote to pacify the latter, and I wrote again sending Kawam a duplicate copy of the receipt, and pointing out that as Kawam was himself responsible to the Financial Department at Shiraz for revenue collected by him, Darya Begi and tbe , Bushire Financial Department had saved him trouble by accounting for it to1 t r m : ri . Shiraz. I further pointed out that while he himself was rarely m the neigh bourhood of the ports, Darya Begi was always in a position to deal with them bv sea. and could punish evil-doers: I suggested that instead of threatening .Shaikh Ibrahim about revenue duly paid he should turn his attention to punishing his subordinate Shaikh Mazkur of Gaobandi, who not only assisted the murderers of the late Residency Agent, a warm friend or Kawam s own father, but still went unpunished for a piracy on a British ^ vessel in 1913 and other crimes. I next heard from the Vice-Consul at Lmgah that Kawam had summoned Shaikh Ibrahim to his camp in the country of the opposite faction and that Shaikh Ibrahim had asked the Vice-Consul whether he should go or not. Trusting in the obligations of Kawam to the Biitis , Mr. Mungavin advised the Shaikh to obey. By this mail both Darya Begi and mvself received a batch of letters stating that Kawam had refused to accept the financial Department receipts for Shaikh Ibrahim’s revenue, had ordered him to pay the 2,000 tumans over again to himself as revenue, and 4,000 tumans . as a fine for contumacy, and handed him over to the custody of an unfriendly neighbour, Soulat-ul-Mulk. Not content with this, Kawam had warmly espoused the cause of the Obeidali Shaikhs, and had sent sowars who have ejected the Hammadi Shaikhs from Chirn Port and will hand it back together with Hinderahi Island to the rascal who sheltered the murderers : and in addition these men have destroyed by Kawarn’s orders out of spite most of the residencies and watch-towers of the Hammadi District, simply because its rulers are unfriendly with the Obeidali. I fear worse may come, for the hostile faction, Shaikh Mazkur in parti cular, have got hold of Kawam and are urging him to turn out by force the Darya Begi’s nominees installed in the other ports last July, and reinstate themselves. Mr. Mungavin writes that if we do not insist on the reinstatement of Shaikh Ibrahim Hammadi at Chiru and hand back Hinderabi Island to him, the other Shaikhs of the coast will think it better to knuckle under to the inland, hostile faction, rather than to trust the British acting in concert with the Governor of the Ports. I wish to represent the following reasons for considering the Kawam’s action highly reprehensible generally and almost insulting and ungrateful towards the Residency :— I. Kawam has ignored the letters I wrote to him on the subject, asking him to leave Shaikh Ibrahim in peace. He has publicly refused to accept an official receipt for revenue on behalf of the Pars Government to which he is himself responsible for revenue: and insisted on putting the money in his own pocket (I trust it is intended in Shiraz to make him account for every toman he has levied in this region). Not content with that, he has fined the Shaikh for obeying the Darya Begi’s orders and paying it to Bushire: and deprived him of Chiru and destroyed his towers which the Shaikh was occupying by the express authority of Darya Begi after the latter with the assistance of His Majesty’s Navy had put him there. II. In view of fact that the late Kawam received all possible assistance at Bushire, that the guns and ammunition and money with which the Kawam is only able to fillibuster in this way, were supplied to him by His Majesty’s Government and that he was paid large sums recently to chastise the Baharlus, not to collect dues, twice over from peaceful Shaikhs on the coast, I think that as a matter of courtesy Kawam might have consulted me before taking such action, and listen to my request. III. I had notified Kawam that Shaikh Mazkur and Ali Akbar Khan, Galladari, and the Obeidali Shaikhs were guilty in our eyes and asked him to punish the two former. Instead, Kawam has warmly supported the Obeidalis and Shaikh Mazkur, and party. I told him I could not agree to our arrange ment of last summer being upset so soon in favour of such a rascal as the Obeidali Shaikh unless the latter handed over his brother, who was actually in ^charge of Chiru at the time of the murder, for punishment.42 IY. Kawam and his father have been in the habit of coming south of Lar only once or twice every five years and even then never visit the actual coast districts; further, experience has shown (and numerous volumes of records prove) that it is hopeless to expect them when at Shiraz to give justice to important complaints of ours, as in the well known “ Taona ” piracy and many other piracies and murder cases. On the other hand, the coast ports are easily within the control of the Governor of the Gulf Ports and his ships or ours lent to him. I think the sudden escapade of Kawam’s in the Hammadi District at the expense of Darya BegPs authority and British influence shows up a most undesirable state of administrative chaos. Darya Begi is naturally much incensed. I, therefore, beg that you will obtain telegraphic orders from the Persian Government to Farman Parma repeated to Darya Begi, Kawam-ul-Mulk and ♦ myself withdrawing all the Shibkuh Ports and their dependent districts and islands and revenue from the supervision of Kawam-ul-Mulk and placing them for administrative co-ordination and cohesion under the direct authority of the Governor of the Gulf Ports and islands, who is usually an independent Governor but at present responsible to the Governor-General of Pars. I may add that during Darya BegPs earlier terms of office as Governor of the Gulf Ports, these Shibkuh Ports were, he says, under him. When he left the Gulf soon after the arrival of the Belgian Customs, these ports were taken away from the Gulf Local Government. It is obvious that they should be under it, and as far back as 1908 Sir Percy Cox was pressing that the Shibkuh Ports should be restored to the Gulf Ports---?;£&lt;ie his despatch 35 — 796 , dated 8th March 1908. This letter also shows that the Soulat-ul- Mulk Zabit of Bastak, who has on this occasion egged the Kawam on to this action, was in 1908 a thorn in our flesh. In this despatch Sir Percy Cox after giving numerous instances of the deplorable results of the present system “ it seems to me, however, that we have ample grounds for compelling or persuading the Persian Government to place absolutely and not nominally the whole of the ‘ Persian Coast and Islands ’ as described in our Order in Council of. 1907, at least as far as Jask under the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and at all events to give him control of those ports beyond that point where Customs ports are maintained * * . * * * I trust you may find it possible to induce him (Nizam-us-Sultaneh) to take some steps to bring the Soulet-ul-Mulk- to his bearings in such a way as will leave the Governor of Bushire with undivided jurisdiction in regard to Kais Island and the part of neighbourhood of Charak, with which its population is racially connected.” I think that we have even better grounds for doing this now, and I trust that you will be able to get the Persian Government to do this and so prevent the recurrence of such acts by the Kawam. I would also suggest that Ivawam should refund the fine inflicted on Shaikh Ibrahim and make good losses caused at Chiru by his sowars. A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Government of India and to Colonel Gough and I should be glad if you would advise me of its receipt by telegram as the posts are so uncertain. I regret having had to trouble you at such length regarding this matter. jp^ I find I have omitted to state that, when the Kawam came to Gaobandi, I was unable to arrange for one of H. M. ships to be present olf the coast to put a check on his vagaries, because the Commodore could not possibly spare a ship, all being engaged on convoy and other important duties.List of Enclosures. •1.

When he himself undertakes to render every service, although, taking it for granted, some assistance were afforded by his brother in connection with the escape of the late Khan Bahadur’s murderers from the borders of Obeidali, for which they are now sorry and have received due punishment, the British authorities should not consent that, in spite of the old enmity existing between the families of Hammadi and Obeidali, the island of Hinderabi and Chiru, which were the borders of Obeidali, and were intrusted to that Shaikh, should be (now) in the hands of Hammadi and Shaikh Ibrahim interferes in them.

On the 16th of August 1916 I had the honour of writing to Your Excel lency at length about the whole matter of Shaikh Abdullah and other persons on the coast who had to he punished for assisting the murderers of the late Khan Bahadur Asha Bedr. U ° - Sr ■ / -n, 1 ' ; ' 'V - The enquiries made by His Excellency the Sardar Darya Begi showed that in spite of tne letters from the Deputy Governor of Lingah, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Lingah and from himself instructing the Shaikhs to apprehend and hand over to justice these miscreants, not only did Shaikh •Not reprinted.44 Abdullah not do this, but he went so far as to assist them, give them clothes and food and help them to get away in a boat. Just lately these facts have again been corroborated by the confession made by one of the party Husain fiandari to His Majesty’s Consul, Bunder Abbas. j ' ' Seeing the conduct of Obeidali Shaikhs I was compelled to ask His Excellency the Darya Begi Sardar to punish them and this he did by turning them out of Chiru. I think Your Excellency will agree that Shaikhs who help such dastardly criminals to escape do not deserve to be in the position of Zabit, and that the removal from such office is the least punishment which could be meted out to them. I understand that Shaikh Abdullah states that he did not himself help these rascals but that his brother who was acting Zabit at the moment did so. His Excellency the Sardar has no certain evidence on this point, but if Shaikh Abdullah will hand over his brother to His Excellency for justice and punish ment if it is proved that he committed the fault, then the question of reinstating Shaikh Abdullah can be considered. It is of course unfortunate that the Shaikh who has been put in charge of Hinderabi and Chiru is at enmity with the Obeidali clan but there was no other Shaikh who could be put in charge. In view of the above facts I trust Your Excellency will agree that I can not recommend His Excellency Darya Begi Sardar to reinstate the Obeidali Shaikhs at present, much as I regret being unable to accede to your friendly request. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew assurances of my esteem and regard. Sub-Enclosure No. 3. Extract from a letter from Kawam-ul-Mulh^ Bairam, to Bis Excellency Darya Begi, Bushire, dated the 8th Jamadi 11335 (14th March 1917). Your letter No. 637 has been received. Your Excellency had referred to the action taken with regard to Chiru and Shaikh Ibrahim. On account of this action, the peace of Shibkuh has been disturbed, the revenue has not been collected and every one is seeking some ambitious object or other. In view of the fact that you were in charge of the district, and of the kind regards which you have for me, it would have been well for you to have asked me to take such action as was necessary and reasonable. Being responsible for maintaining order and collecting revenues in these places, I am now put to great inconvenience and loss owing to this action of yours, and I am now compelled to proceed to Shibkuh. My inten tion is that all Shaikhs should present themselves, so that I may make an arrangement regarding their rights and districts, and collect the revenues. I will not be unkind to Shaikh Ibrahim, especially now that he has been recommended by Your Excellency. But if he does not present himself and evades coming, I shall have to treat him in another manner, for which he will have to blame himself. Sub-Enclosure No. 4. Translation of a letter from Kawam-ul-Mulk at Bairam to His Excellency Darya Begi, Governor, Bushire, dated the 14th Jamadi I 1335 (20th March). I already sent an answer to your letter regarding Shaikh Ibrahim, Zabit of Hammadi. This incident has totally disturbed the peace of Shibkuh, and although 1 had a thousand affairs in other places, it has caused me to come to these parts, and spend large sums of money for the expenses of the expedition, and at the same time prevented from attending to other affairs. Although you did not mean to inconvenience me, and this state of affairs is only anatural result, yet this inconvenience and expenditure has fallen — However, 1 am aware of your kind regards, and I will bear with it. Shaikh Ibrahim has come to Ishknan. As he has pud his revenue into the Finance Department of the Gulf Ports, contrary to the usual procedure, it has been arranged that he should pay it here and get it refunded from the Finance Department of the Ports. Your Excellency will, of course, order that his money he refunded to him. As regards Bandar Chiru and Hinderahi Island, inasmuch as the inter ference of the Hammadis in the districts of Obeidali, in view of their old hostility to one another, will disturb the peace of Shibkhu and make it difficult to collect the revenue, and cause me trouble and expenses, it is arranged that there should only be a representative of Soulat-ul-Mulk in that place, who is to suppress any trouble or quarrel between them, so that _ the people may be at ease. I have sent Mulla Ahmad, Kalantar of Paramarzi, there, as he was introduced to me by Soulat-ul-Mulk. I have stated this for Your Excellency’s information. I will give permission to Satwat-ul-Mamalik to return to Lingah in a few days’ time. Sub-Enclosure No. o. Dated the 19th Jamadi I 1335 (13th March 1917). jrjon! Shaikh Allak Hammadi (cousin of Shaikh Ibrahim Hammadi), To—His Excellency Darya Begi, Governor of the Gulf Ports. I heo- to state that His Excellency Kawam-ul-Mulk is proceeding towards Gaoband?, and stayed at Ishknan for some days, whence he sent two or three letters to my cousin, Haji Shaikh Ibrahim, instructing the latter to go and see him. My cousin informed the Residency at Lingah, and the Residency- replied that he should of course go and see Kawam-ul-Mulk, because the latter was on friendly terms with the British authorities. Now that my cousin has gone to Ishknan, and taken the receipts for the revenue with him, His Excellency Kawam-ul-Mulk has told him that he would not agree to Shaikh Ibrahim having paid the sum of 2,000-tomans into the Finance Department of Bushire. He ordered Shaikh Ibrahim to pay 2,000 tomans on account of the revenue, and 4,000 tomans as a fine. My cousin, Shaikh Ibrahim, is now in detention while some sowars of Kawam-ul-Mulk and some from Soulat-ul-Mulk have been sent to take possession of the fort of Chiru, and hand it over to Shaikh Ahmad Obeidali. Some more sowars have been ordered to demolish all the forts of the districts of Hammadi and Badui, with the assistance of Soulat-ul-Mufk and Satwat-ubMamalik. My cousin has been ordered to pay 6,000 tumans, he is still in detention, and has been off towards Gaobandi by Kawam-ul-Mulk, and will be released on payment of 6,000 tomans. I beg Your Excellency to he kind enough to use your influence that this money should not be taken from us, and to save us from this highhandedness on the part of Kawam-ul-Mulk. We are greatly astonished that Shaikh Mazkur and Shaikh Abdullah Oheidali, who are guilty in the eyes of both Governments, have been shown kindness, and have received khalatSt while we, who are rendering sincere services to both, are being ill-treated and mulcted in fines. It appears that His Excellency Kawam-ul-Mulk and Soulat-ul-Mulk and Satwat-ul-Mamalik are your hitter enemies, when they have made such unjust claims against us. Sub-Enclosnre No. 6. Dated the 23rd Jamadi I 1335 (I7tk March 1917), From— Shaikh Allak Hammadi (cousin of Shaikh Ibrahim Hammadi), To—His Excellency Darya Beqi, Governor of the Gulf Ports, Bushire. His Excellency Kawam-ul-Mulk has visited Gaobandi to collect the revenue, and the sowars, who had been sent by Kawam-ul-Mulk and Soulat-ul- Mulk to take possession of the iort of Chiru, and demolish the forts of the. { 46 &gt; district, have been duly given charge, of the fort in compliance with His Excellency’s orders, gome of Souiat-ul-Mulk’s men are occupying the fort, which will he handed over later on to Shaikh Ahmad Obeidali, who is guilty in the eyes of the two Governments. Kawam-ul-Mulk’s sowars, who were sent to destroy the forts of the Saif Coast route, reached Muehail, Jizeh and Hakhailu, which were under my jurisdiction and which they have looted. They arrived at Mukam to demolish the fort called Chah-i-Ali. I sent some poor men to destroy the fort, and they did so. After the fort was destroyed, the sowars seized and carried off 20 camels, all my things which were at the fort, as well as the things of the poor people, 40 men, 20 “ Files ” and Martini rifles and 15 tent-shot pistols. They took them to Shaikh Abdullah Obeidali, who has been considered guilty towards the two Governments, while as to my cousin who has been dutiful, and has always given his maliyat, Kawam-ul-Mulk has said that does not agree, and that Shaikh Ibrahim should now pay 2,000 tomans revenue and 4,000 tomans fine. My cousin has been confined and Kawam-ul-Mulk wishes that all the districts of Hammadi and Badavi should be destroyed, Soulat-ul- Mulk and Satwat-ul-Mamalik have done this, because we are serving Your Excellency and obeying your orders. I beg that Your Excellency will use your efforts in favour of us, as long as Qawam-ul-Mulk remain in these parts. The reports which I already sent to Your Excellency will have reached you by now. 101 Telegram, No. G.-17, dated the 26th March 1917., From— Colonel Oeton, Kerman, To—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Bunder Abbas. The best sheltered anchorage at Bunder Abbas lies, I believe, to the west of the town under lee of Qishn Island.

German and one vernacular text Amir, Uda-ipur and Gwalior.—One each. These I hope to forward in a few days by safe opportunity. German papers were received by me from Sykes en bloc along with Brugmann’s account books, &amp;c., and I do not remember having seen or heard anything of any letter to Amir other than the samd. I did not then realise importance iportanoe of the documents and Sykes had not time to make out and hand over a detailed list. I fell (ili ?) a few days later and when I v _. .j u went through papers though still seriously ill in September the only records 1 had were copies of Sykes’ telegram 2f0 and of his letter No. 100-P. of July 22nd (your copy apparently dated July 27th). translation attached latter, letter to Amir referred to therein is identical with sanad now being forwarded to you.

In my opinion the reduced force (one Infantry Battalion and two squadrons Cavalry) could be commanded efficientJy by the 0. C. Infantrv Battalion.

I am afraid I have not explained difficulties of position with sufficient lucidity. Apart from starting branches of South Persia Eifles at Bunder Abbas and Kerman 1 have taken over disorganised gendarmes in Ears and have reorganised and disciplined them in spite of strong opposition from their officers during critical period. To effect this I gave up Hunter and have done entire work of headquarters and Column with Thorburc, besides taking over German prisoners and devoting much time to difficult and complicated political situa tion always inseparably connected with restoration of order All units given in monthly reports are organised and scheme is practically complete but till arrival of furthei staff I cannot stop urgent work and devote necessary time for working out details. J am blamed (for ?) piecemeal system, but I am con vinced you will agree when you know all and the circumstances that it was inevitable. I fully realize and regret inconvenience caused but the taking ever of gendaimes made it imperative to study their system before deciding line of scheme,2y taking over gendarmerie we are' bound to charge rates of pay of Swedish scale with some modification. Had it been possible to submit scheme before making this study it would have been of little value whereas it has now been studied and tested and is at work. Furthermore knowing heavy strain on military resources of India I refrained from making any more demands until they were undoubtedly justified. If you decline to supply more officers and equipment pending the receipt of complete scheme and presumably approve it which will take many months restoration of order in Southern Persia Eifles and formation of the force will be seriously delayed. This would be a pity in view of present favourably politic/situation of which full advantage should be taken. If however you will trust to my judgment a little farther please supply officers and equipment to form Engineer companies asked for in my telegram No. 436. We are already making road to Niriz passable for motor cars and badly want such corps. Please also supply medical officer for Kerman to replace Captain Husband deceased and two medical officers for Ears. One of latter should have special qualification as Bacteriologist if possible with apparatus. I have hitherto refrained from asking for badly needed medical officers but feel that I must do so now. Of above except one medical officer for Kerman should travel up with Euck in April. 59 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 4906, dated the 7th April 1917.

They would take over section of road and join up with Abadeh which is strong Southern Persia Rifles centre. I propose also to retain half of 16th Rajputs at Sirjan in addition to one Company Burma Mounted Infantry already detailed. They would garrison this important centre and convey munitions of war ana other valuable military'stores. These could not be entrusted to Southern Persia Rifles who will have to take over Kerman-Sirjan section and section near Bunder Abbas would not at first he strong enough to carry out all above duties unaided wiih possible hostilities of Baharlus and Sirkuhis on flank. This arrangement would not be effected by Orton’s proposal for Pioneer Battalion (vide his telegram G.-U). Niriz would be garrisoned by Southern Persia Rifles as it would be unwise to post small Indian force there. Half of 16th Rajputs, one company Burma Mounted Infantry and one section Mountain Battery would be left to garrison Shiraz. Under this scheme Company of 108th Infantry referred to in my tele gram No. 557 would not be needed.

Owing to opinion of Kerman that weakening of small force at Sirjan would result in our being compelled to withdraw entirely and that immediate possession of district would he takeu by ear-prisoners and their tribal supporters the proposal was negatived. In view of the improved condition of Kerman province, there seems no longer anv justification for this detachment at Saidabad.

South Persia Rifles should have been enough trained by the autumn up to which time our critical (?) period lasts. Moreover the Kawam has not tackled Baharlus or Tanghis who are at present (quite ?) unwilling to submit or surrender prisoners. Yet again the alignment for motor road most probably will pass through Sirjan and this will increase its importance. There has been an immense improvement in the position owing to the recent victories but lack of rain will increase scarcity almost amounting to famine and also number of robberies. Moreover the questions of Kazerun and Souiat are not yet settled. By garrisoning of Sirjan my hands would be considerably strengthened while withdrawal of garrison would probably meau return of escaped prisoners and their tribal supporters.

Colonel Gough and my self relative to a sugges tion made by His Ma jesty’s Government to the effect that trade for Shiraz should be diverted to Lingah or Bunder Abbas. 2. About the same time that the reference was received from His Majesty’s Minister His Excellency the Darya Begi received several letters from His Boyal Highness the Earman Earma, suggesting that the Bushire-Shiraz road should be closed as a punishment to the Khans and traffic diverted to the Lingah-Lar-Fasa-Shiraz route The Darya Begi desired to have a me; ting about this proposal and accordingly one took place at which one or two leading British and Persian merchants were present. The result of this meeting is reported in enclosure 5. 3 The general idea seems to be that if the roads from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz become really safe a lot of the trade will go by that route, but that merchants will not go to Die expense of sending goods to Bunder Abbas^ unless they are pretty sure,-, that the roads are safe. Colonel Gough is very sanguine that the roa&lt;Scan be made safe but I am by no means sure of it myself. Unless the Qawam can give the Baharlus a really crushing defeat (and there seems no prospect of this) I see no reason why that tribe should refrain from its usual occupation of highw-ay robbery. In fact it appears to me that if all the Shiraz traffic as well as the Bunder Abbas traffic is on the roads leading out of Bunder Abbas, it will be a direct incentive to them to increase their activities. 4. On the Bunder Abbas-Lar route in addition to the dangers of robbery the question of lack of transport animals, and scarcity of supplies water and grazing have to be considered. I think it is very doubtful if enough animals can be procured without depleting transport on the Kerman road. The question of supplies and grazing would not be so difficult for next few months as good rain has fallen, but by the time the route got into full working order, it would probably have become acute. 5. I need hardly add that if the Persian and British authorities give up the direct route to Shiraz and divert traffic to devious routes, it would, in my opinion, have the worst possible effect locally, and would encourage swash bucklers like Nasr-i-Diwan of Kazarun and the Khans of Borazjun and Cbakutah to think that they were masters of the situation.Enclo.

Routes to Shiraz from Lingeh and Bunder Abbas can be used temporarily for post and urgent requirements of Government and South Persia Rifles, but if it is proposed to divert all Shiraz trade to one of those routes as a per manency, I doubt feasibility of proposal for following reasons :— (1) Both routes to Shiraz are about 330 miles, nearly double Kazerun route. No caravanserais or otner facilities exist, and there is no guarantee that disturbances will not render both dangerous for trade at any time, in Lar region and nearer Shiraz. Dislocation following any such disturbance would be greater than now. It may be noted that Baharius have recently been active near Bunder Abbas and may be again if Qawam does not succeed in smashing them. (2) Transport animals available on Lingeh route are very few, and could only cope vrith small part of Shiraz trade and other requirements. Bunder Abbas has insufficient number to undertake supply Shiraz in addition to Kerman and its other markets. Heavy goods cannot go by donkeys, which are principally used on both routes. Road from Lingeh to Bastak very difficult. (3) Trade relations, large stocks on hand in Bushire and shipping arrange ments could not suddenly be transferred to these other ports where facilities are insufficient. Persian merchants, i.e., those handling bulk of trade, very conser- yatiye, and w r ould certainly not abandon their connections with BusEire route, where they can always count on considerable though still insufficient supply of transport, despite conditions in coast region. We shall only see by experience of next few months whether trade takes to either routes suggested and to what extent. I think it is doubtful if sufficient trade would leave present routes Bushire-Shiraz to justify Persian Government ignoring their responsibility for protecting them.Enclo. No. 4.

I have consulted Farman Farma and he agrees with me that development of road from Bunder Abbas to take place of Bushire road is both desirable and feasible. It would very quickly bring lawless Khans to order. On the other hand it would hit Soulet very hard. There are three routes available : from Lingeh via Lar, etc., from Bunder Abbas via Lar; and from Bunder Abbas via Sirjan and Niris. First is not practicable owing to want of supplies and water at certain times of the year, second is good as far as supplies go, but is liable to raids by robbers. Third is best and can be guarded and will not cost much to turn greater portion into carriage road. It is however much longer. Merchants, would I believe, prefer second route if we could assure safety and this depends on Qawam’s power to keep Arabs in order. Perhaps Bunder Abbas will give their views as to shipping and unloading facilities and vested interests in latter place. I would recommend second route for trade and third route as an alternative.

The Darya Begi received by last mail via Lingeh a letter despatched middle of January from Farman Farma in which latter asked if it would be possible to divert Shiraz traffic from Bushire route to Lingeh-Lar route. Darya Begi asked me to meet him and others to discuss question on Wednesday, and I propose to ask one or two leading merchants to be present. After meeting I shall be in a position to say what mercantile communities’ views are regarding diversion of trade. Is Farman Farma’s idea to close all routes from Bushire to Shiraz or simply to discourage traffic on them. If former, one of conditions made for exchange of Shiraz prisoners was that Shahi route should be open. Enclo. No. 6. Telegram R., No. 36-281, dated the 14th February 1917.

(Repeated to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, Chief Political Officer, Basrah, and His Majesty's Vice-Cousul, Bunder Abbas.) My telegram 34—271. Meeting took place this morning. As regards commercial aspect of the question, consensus of opinion was that transfer of trade route would be worth while and rnpay cost of shipping to Bunder Abbas stocks for Shiraz now lying here (vaguely estimated at 15 to 30,000 loads) only if— (1) New route could be adequately protected. (2) Routes from Bushire to Shiraz could be totally closed.5 As regards (1) Darya Begi expressed view that, as so far it had not been possible to take steps to restore law and order ic Pars, lawless elements, on hearing that all merchandise for Shiraz was proceeding on a certain route, would concentrate on that route. The object of (2) would be to prevent Khans and merchants of Borazjun being in a position to purchase goods in Bushire ostensibly for local consump tion but really for transmission to Shiraz there to undersell merchandise brought by more devious routes. It, however, cuts both ways and another result would be that Khans would seize all merchandise now on the road, and either plunder it or keep it as security that road will be used. Head of Municipality who keeps record of loads leaving Bushire estimated that there are about 3,000 loads at Borazjun, 30u at Daliki and 2,000 at Kazerun. Similarly he estimates there are some 10,000 donkey loads (mostly sugar) between Ahram and Eiruzabad which will take about tw 7 o months to reach Shiraz. These would probably be also made away with. In order to enable all this merchandise to reach Shiraz and thus save heavy loss it would be necessary to defer changing routes while merchants themselves restricted merchandise going up on ground that they had so much on road that they were unable to despatch more till it had got through, or for some other plausible reason. It is doubtful whether they would hang together sufficiently, and it is probable that whenever road was closed large number loads would remain in hands of Khans. Enclo.

Gough’s telegram 50 and my immediately preceding telegram addressed to Gough. Afterjmeeting Darya Begi discussed political aspect of closing the road here and transferring traffic to Bunder Abbas. Eollowing conclusions arrived at. Khans as mentioned in my telegram 32-267, anticipate move against them : if they find that we not only do not make any but transfer our trade to Bunder Abbas, they will probably assume that we are afraid of them. This will make them puffed up. If we close the road they may consider it breach of arrangement made last August and resume active hostilities. Apart from this, closing the road is not likely to bring lawless Khans to order, unless strict blockade of the Tangistan and Dashti coast is enforced, and even then it would take some time. The road was closed for more than a year between July 1915 and August 1916 and closing only began to take effect just at the end. It would take longer now as, in anticipation of opera tions against them, Zair Khadhar and other Khans have been smuggling in large stocks of rice and other food stuffs to stock their hill fastnesses. To close road thoroughly would entail prevention of free going in and out of Bushire, and this would hit peaceful agriculturists and gardeners harder than the hostile Khans. Darya Begi is firmly convinced that if steps could be taken to punish one ^ Khan severely, the road question would settle itself. ^ ^ j/ic^CoJLaj^ I think he is probably right. j (fli'ui ? Enclo.

Between Bunder Abbas and Lar supplies are scanty and at some stages nil, but the road is said to be easier than from Lingeh and considerably shorter than through Saidabad. We could perhaps subsidize high Arab Chiefs through Qwam to safeguard the route. Transport would have to be drawn from Lar- Shiraz section where it is said to be fairly plentiful but it is doubtful whether it would suffice if all Bushire-Shiraz trade were diverted here. Bunder Abbas is a regular port of call for all cargo ships visiting the Gulf. Landing facilities are meagre owing to absence of wharves and a proper pier. Custom promises too are limited with the result that congestion often occurs. All these drawbacks however can be removed and will probably he investigated shoHly by the trade commissioners.

Beal obstacles are want of supplies and insufficient water which is dependent on rain fail (good this year) and stored in reservoirs while for animals water is * . I am informed these objections could be much improved. Lingeh route could be used as an alternative when conditions are favourable. It would be wise to close the Bushire road only by degrees to lessen losses mentioned by Trevor. I am in accord with Bushire view that punishment of Khans is essential whether it is decided to close the road or not. 211 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 3450, dated the 7th March 1917.)

The squadron of cavalry now at Birjand and Sehdeh is reported by the force S. !M. 0. to be unfit for active service, in consequence of the ill effects of the water at Bandan, where it was stationed for several months last year. It is hoped that supply arrangements will allow of this unit beinsr brought down to Ladis, in which case it will be relieved at Birjand by half the squadron now at Neh and Bandan. 5. The improvement of the former camel track from Mirjawa to Kwash appears to have had a good moral effect on the Lamanis in addition to lessening the wear and tear on'camels. This track is now suitable for motor traffic and allows of a fully laden car completing the lOLj- miles from Saindak to Kwash in nine hours, including halts. Should operations in the Sarhad ever again become necessary this track will facilitate movement and permit of a rapid reinforcement of the Kwash garrison. 6. No news of the situation in the Shiraz and Sirjan districts has reached the Sarhad. It appears probable that when this news shall arrive it will produce little effect for the reason that the differences between Bahram Khan and his neighbours are likely to detract attention from events elsewhere. 7. At my recent interview, at Kwash, on the 16th February with Jiand and Nur Muhammad, it was pleasing to note their subdued demeanour and the very marked absence of the truculent swagger they displayed at the Darbar in November last. From their general attitude they appear now to have realised their position, and it is improbable lhat they will cause trouble for several months to come. 242 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 3448, dated the 7th March 1917.)

On February 25th, Najaf Khan arrived at Lingah from Lar and says that Rais Ali Naki imprisoned him at Hormuz and that all his notes made during his travels and his books were taken. Also that the 450 rupees which Qi'gave him as a present on leaving Lar were stolen from him. As he suspected him of collecting information for the British, Najaf Khan is convinced that Q. is at the bottom of this. He says Muntasir ? ? Mulk, the head of Q.’s troops is disavowedly (?) anti-British and likely to cause trouble, and that, as expectation of the situation becoming serious again, Q. himself is merely sitting on the fence. Munitions of War have been distributed by Q. a« follows J (1) 100 loads of Lee-Metford rifles at Fasa in charge of Khaitan Khan. (2) At Kut-va-South, 180 boxes of rifles ammunition and 15-pr. shell, a 15-pr. gun is to be stationed here. (3) 1 9-pr. and 1 machine gun have been given to Soulet. As Q. would not release the sepoys whom it had been arranged should be sent to Lingah from Lar, they are still with him. Unless he is brought into line Q.’s attitude may possibly sooner or later cause serious delay to the Column which is now on its way to Shiraz. 250 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 3545, dated the 9th March 1917.)

(Addressed Consul, Shiraz; repeated Tehran and Basrah.) Your telegram No. 81. . , n ^ 0 i j. Telegraph Ghulam reports Nasr-ed-Divan has received letter from Souiet and has sent copies of it to all rebel Khans of Dashtistan and Tangistan. Copy reached Khan of Borasjun on March 8th and was discussed by Khan and advisers there. Ghulam has obtained and forwarded copy. Soulet writes that he has received Nasr-ed-Divan’s communication stating that he was obedient to Government and only objected to foreigners interfering in affairs ; Soulet agrees that what Nasr-ed-Divan says is but says he should not have acted as he did. ^ Soulet continues that he has been asked by Government to settle this affair, and that his object is that trouble should pass over in such a manner that neither Nasr-ed.-Divan should get into difficulties nor he himself be embarrassed ; if Nasr-ed-Divan desires to be obedient to Government he should get his allies in Dashtistan and other places each to send representatives to himT Soulet, so that he may arrange matters and reassure Governor-General, otherwise he will have no alternative but to take action in interests of State. Soulet goes on to say that Nasr-ed-Divan should give him assurances so that he can “ reassure Government Authorities. Perhaps this matter will be settled satisfactorily and certain troubles^ and difficulties be averted.” (Presumably meaning suppression of rebel Khans and extension of influence of Governor-General and British along road.) Soulet concludes by saying he will leave for neighbourhood of Kazerun very shortly and will discuss matters with Nasr-ed-Divan there, meanwhile he is waiting for Nasr-ed-Divan to inform him of result of his communication with Khans of Dashtistan et cetera. This letter is presumably genuine as it has been discussed at Borasjun. It shows that Soulet intends to gain by a settlement which is absolutely incom patible with needs of situation, viz., that rebel Khans should no longer control road. Soulet evidently fears extension of law and order by British influence and regards it in his own interests to maintain rebel Khan in power. In the circumstances I would repeat warning against giving Soulet slightest encouragement to constitute himself, as from above he evidently desires to do, protector of or mediator on behalf of rebel Khans of Dashtistan and Tangistan who are entirely outside his sphere..13 254 No. i2' a S., dated Bushire, the 26th February (received 5th March) 1917 (Confidential).

I should very much doubt if Soulet will agree to having a Political Officer with the late Qawam demurred to this. Enclo. No. 1 to Serial No. 261.

If it is definitely decided that our forces are not to undertake any opera tions from Bushire, and if it is agreed to use Soulet’s services as suggested, I think it would be possible to arrange for Darya Begi with assistance of friendly Khans to operate against Khans at this end, if His Majesty’s Govern ment consider this desirable and are prepared to lend him two or three guns and a few machine guns and to finance the operations as was done in the case of Qawam. Possibly, however, it may be desirable to wait and see if the recent victory at Kut results in the Turks withdrawing from Persia, before starting nego tiations. If the Turks and Germans do withdraw, it seems probable that rebels and hostile elements, etc., will collapse as they did last time. Enclo. No. 4 to Serial No. 261.

Your telegram 74. Letter from Muhammad Khan Kashkuli to Kalanter of Khisht refers to despatch of Soulet’s envoy to Kazerun to “ effect general alliance ” and states Soulet willing to undertake restoration of order along Shahi road on condition (1) that control of Shahi road is given him, (2) no Gendarmes (? South Persia Bifles) are placed along it, (3) arrangements for road-guards left to Soulet. Above with addition of request for ammunition, etc., probably sum for paying road guards seem likely to be basis of Soulet’s demands. As Qashgai will begin migrating in about three weeks and their influence on Shahi route between Kazerun and Shiraz will cease in about six weeks, is it worth while negotiating with Soulet at all now ? But perhaps you anticipate danger to Shiraz during migration. Of course you are the best judge of these points, but I hope, if negotia tions do take place that only portion of road above Konartakhteh will be dealt with. Experience shows that Soulet is powerless to deal effectively with Dashtistan.

On the other hand it is realised by myself how opportune present moment is for action by Bersians. Hence I am prepared to entertain Farman Farma’s proposal (see Shiraz telegram to you, 6) that Soulet should be paid by results. “ jf it is feasible, experiment is worth trying if you can at the same time make arrangements with Darya Begi on lines of your telegram 8. No munitions of war whatever should be given by us to Souiet and he would he paid by His Majesty’s Government through Farman Farma according to results achieved up to maximum of tomans 30,000 a month for three months. “ Very early action seems desirable in view of tribal migration in April and impression of Kut and Hamadan. If you are satisfied you may act in the sense of above immediately. Ends.' Conclusions arrived at in Bushire telegram 56-459 are in my opinion sound and should be borne in mind in negotiation with Soulet.

Following from Consul, Shiraz :— Begins. Your telegram No. 459. My information also shows Soulet has called a meeting of Khans at Firuza- bad in order to settle Kazerun difficulties. It is true he is endeavouring to settle affair at the request of Government and I have myself written to him to do so hut at the same time I have formally assured him we will not agree to pardon of or any terms he may make with Nasr-ed-Divan or other rebels. Both Sykes and I are convinced since His Majesty’s Government will do nothing from Bushire w r e must make what terms we can with Soulet (though naturally not given him any encouragement towards idea of constituting himself protector of Dashtistan and Tangistan) with a view to drawing him to our side. His former suspicious attitude has recently changed and victories in Mesopotamia should bring him definitely over to us. At present South Persia Bifles are not available as a fighting force and cannot be used as such until they have been trained which cannot be before next autumn. When Indian reinforcements arrive Sykes has ideas of placing a force of about 600 strong at Dehbid for summer. This and partially trained South Persia Bifles detachment at Abade should keep road open for traffic if we have a friendly Soulet but with unfriendly or hostile Soulet our difficulties will be enormous and it will be almost impossible to continue to hold road with untrained South Persia Bifles.5 ... aut ^Ji w e should be iu really strong position and able to deal with Bushire road difficulty or with Soulet himself should he prove refractory.

(Addressed Tehran ; repeated Shiraz and Basrah.) Your telegram No. 33. Some days ago I had informal conversation with Darya Begi about deal ing with hostile Khans, His Excellency seemed confident of being able to deal with them, and did not anticipate serious opposition provided we could lend him three guns with gunners and two or three machine guns. He said he would have to ask us to provide rifle ammunition and possibly some rifles as the Khans have no rifles which will take our ammunition. His idea is to raise about 100 to 200 rifleman himself and call upon Hayat Daw r d and Shabankareh each to provide contingent of 300 men and Angali 100, which he thinks that they can do. He thinks Khans will gladly help in hope of getting some portions of rebel districts, though they will probably ask for contribution towards upkeep of their contingents. Best season would be shortly before harvest, i.e., about middle of next month. Should I now request His Excellency to take steps to ascertain whether above estimates can be realized and if so to put matters in train as it will take some time to make all arrangements; or should I wait till something has been settled with S oulet. 266 {Received with Army ^Department memorandum No. 3830, dated the 14th March 1917.)

On the facts before them, the Government of India consider that there are sufficient grounds to warrant the internment of Saiyid Mustapha, who appears to have been in close touch with the German and Turkish agents in Herat. There seems to be no object in sending him to Bombay or Peshawar, where he alleges he has acquaintances, and the Government of India have decided that he should be interned in Quetta for the present. • 3. The evidence against him, however, is not very strong, while the facts that he went to Afghanistan before the war and is an elderly man are in his favour. I am to suggest, therefore, that he be further examined at leisure. Should his continued internment appear to you to teunnecessary, proposals for his disposal otherwise should be submitted.i Telegram R., No. 367, dated (andreceived) the 1st March 1917;. 0\ From— Sir P.

C.-45-G.S., dated the 17th February 1917. From—The General Officer Commanding, 4th (Quetta) Division, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Army Headquarters, Delhi. I have the honour to report that I inspected the Nushki-Saindak Line of Communication, leaving Quetta on the 1st February, and returning on the 9th February 1917. I proceeded by rail from Nushki to Dalbandin by the new extension which has just been completed, a distance of about 117 miles, and thence to Saindak by motor car, a further distance of 200 miles. 2. The organization and administration of this Line of Communication is satisfactory generally. 3. Troops. —The detachments of the 126th Baluchistan Infantry at the various posts along the route were well turned out, and their health appeared to be satisfactory. Some temporary huts.or shelters will have to be constructed at certain places, otherwise the health of the troops will certainly suffer during the hot weather, when the heat is excessive, and this I am arranging. 4. Supply arrangements. —Very satisfactory. 5. Transport. —Not as satisfactory as it might be. This is due to the excessive length of most of the marches, lack of grazing and the waterless nature of the country. A party of Sappers has been at work for some time sinking new wells at various places, and improving the old ones, and I have now despatched another party consisting of 10 Sappers and 50 Pioneers (107th) to assist in this work. The grazing at the present halting places has been eaten up and is practically non-existent. I have given orders to the Road Commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. James, that the convoys both to and from Saindak are to commence making shorter marches at once, and it is hoped that the condition of the camels will improve considerably. At present owing to the conditions of the country above mentioned they are undoubtedly half starved, have to march with loads on their backs for far too long a period, which I consider has been in a great measure the cause of the heavy mortality among camels. It is also essential that a ration of bhoosa be given ; this I am arranging for. I have also given orders regarding the inauguration of a system of midway staging and have good reason for hoping that the difficulties that were supposed to exist in doing this, viz., water in insufficient quantity at the changing stations will be overcome. On this system coming into force I anticipate a large reduction in mortality and sickness among the camels working on the road. tio. 2 Q M 9 IVsAR 1917 173 'j Jvl I ! 'The Mechanical Transport Section at Nushki, so far as assistin'* in th | transport of supplies to the Sistan Pield Force is concerned, has been and useles s, and not a single pound of stores has been lifted by it. The cause ^ this is the nature of the country, which is totally unsuited to mechanical transport, nor in my opinion is it possible to make a road which would stand I the wear and tear of continuous motor traffic, such as would be necessary for transporting the supplies required for the Sistan Force, and the troops on the Line of Communication. r 0 As already described the country is a desert, practically waterless and rainless, so that the construction and upkeep of a metalled road would h P a practical impossibility. rece nt inspection, my party consisting of myself two Staff Officers, and the Road Commandant travelled by motor car (3 Overland Cars and 3 Motor Lorries) from Dalbandin to Sain dak in 3 days, but we were only able to accomplish this by having detachments of men posted at certain places ~ to literally pull the cars through the sand. In fact so bad is the track in some places that, in consultation with the General Officer Commanding, Sistan Field Force, I have forbidden any Government motor cars to travel between Maskki h and Sain dak, the worst part of the route. Having some practical exne* nence of Motor Transport and over bad country, I consider that no light car or motor lorry could do more than four journeys between these places without serious breakage of essential parts, and great deterioration to cars, and then only with luck. * u The only practical solution of the transport difficulty is a railway This has been already extended to Dalbandin, about a third of the distance from Nushkr to Eobat, and I consider that its extension to the Persian Frontier for military reasons alone is imperative, 6 Medical arrangements.—Fatisfactorj.

I., dated Ispahan, the Itth December 1916 (received 1st March 1917). From— Lieutenant-Colonel T. W. Haig, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General Ispahan, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to inform you, with reference to my telegram No. 4 of November 7th, 1916, that it has been found impossible to obtain evidence impli cating any one of the sentries placed over the German prisoner Peter Paschen, who escaped from this Consulate General on the night of October 13-14th. The Guard over the prisoner was supplied from 8 a m. to 6 p.m. by the 124th Baluchistan Infantry and from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. by the escort of the 11th King Edward’s Own Lancers attached to this Consulate General. The prisoner was last ascertained to be present at 8-30 p.m. on October 13fch, and his absence was not noticed until 11-45 a.m. on October 14th, when it w r as discovered that what appeared to be a sleeping man was a dummy of clothes made up in the bed. On October 15th, a Court of Inquiry was held under the orders of Colonel E. F. Twigg, commanding the escort of Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes, who was then in Ispahan. This Court took evidence, but recorded no finding or opinion ! upon it, the omission being due, as I am informed by Sir Percy Sykes, to its having no jurisdiction. In these circumstances the assembly of the court appears to me to have been of doutful utility. The hour at which tbe prisoner escaped is of course the important fact in the case, as until this is known no individual sentry can be held responsible. The evidence recorded by the Court of Inquiry contains no indication of the hour of the escape and each of the successive sentries examined appears, from his statement, to have been satisfied that the prisoner was asleep in the bed when he came on duty. 2. The room in which the prisoner was confined was unsuitable for use as a place of confinement, but he certainly could not have escaped without his movements being observed by a sentry who was alert on his post, so that one of the sentries on duty between the hours of 8-30 p.m. and 11-30 a.m must have been guilty at least of gross negligence. On my arrival at Ispahan to take charge of the Consulate General from Mr. Grahame I found three of the sowars of the escort, No. 3111 Jawaya Khan, No. 3112 Sarfaraz Khan, and No. 3195 Ghulam Ali Khan under arrest, they having been the three sentries on duty on the night in question. After considering all the available evidence in the case and ascertaining from Sir Percy Sykes that the men of the 124th Baluchistan Infantry had been dealt with by their Commanding Officer, I released these three men from arrest, as reported in my telegram No. 9 of November 22nd, 1916, as there was no evidence against any one of them, or against the three collectively, which would justify me in sending them before a Court-martial. 3. I consider that the prisoner’s escape was facilitated by the inadequacy of the arrangements for his safe custody and the unnecessary consideration with which he was treated. He was attended by a servant of his own who purchased supplies for him in the bazar and was perfectly free to go where he would, and there can be no doubt that it was through this man that he was enabled to obtain from among the many friends of our enemies in Ispahan, assistance from outside. It is clear from the evidence given before the Court of Inquiry that the sentries were not in the habit of assuring themselves of the prisoner’s presence by waking him at each relief, and the neglect of thi&amp; precaution, though it does not excuse the gross negligence of the sentry,7 whoeYCT he may have been, during whose tour of duty the prisoner escaped, explams the fact that his absence was not observed until so late an hour as S. 31, ,. ^ w * llc ? 1 the prisoner had probably several hours in which to take precautions against being re-captured. Two months have now elapsed since his escape and it is very improbable that he will be recaptured. 4. I consideied it necessary to submit a report on this case as it was found necessary to place three men of the 11th (King Edward’s Own) Lancers of my escort, under arrest in connection with the escape. 232 No 60-C., dated Sistan, the 18th February (received 1st March) 1917. From-LiEUTENANT-CoLONEL F. B. Pridbaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, J To-The Secretary to the Government of India in the Fbreign and Political Depart ment. In continuation of my telegram No. 56-E:, dated the 12th Eebruary 1917, I have the honour to forward copies of two statements made in my office by Syed Mustafa. J 2. The folio containing the papers found on him has been sent to the Chief of the General Staff, Army Headquarters, Simla, for examination. Enclosure No. 1. Statement of Syed Mustafa, son of Syed Sulaiman, son of Syed Ali Akbar Imam-i-Jama. My home is at Muhalla Bayat, Lab-i-ab, Shiraz. My occupation is that of physician, prayer writer and teacher. My age is 54 years. About 16 years ago I had gone to Bombay and was staying near the Botliwala Hospital and Khaja Muhalla, and was there for 13 years working as a physician and prayer writer. Aga Mohamed Ardakani, Haji Mohamed Ali Dah-Dashti of Bori Bunder, Aga Mustafa Sharbat-Earash at Umar Kari, and Mirza Mahram Babi at Apollo Bunder knew me while I was there. About seven years ago, while staying at the Khwaja Muhalla, Bombay, I had run into debt and my property was sold by the Small Cause Court, Bombay. The people had subscribed some money for me and I was earning money by writing prayers (Tawiz) for men. In the hot weather four years ago 1331 (1913) I left Bombay for Peshawar and stayed there for the months of Bajab, Shaban, Bamazan, Shawal, Ziqad Zilhij 1331 and Muharram, Safar and Babi 1, 1332 (June 1913 to Eebruary 1914). I was staying with Mohamed Zarif Khan, Superintendent of Govern ment House, and Mohamed Dilwar Khan, clerk in the Supply and Transport Department, who are brothers. I had left Bombay because I could not succeed in business. At Peshawar I was selling country medicines. I know Lutfali Khan and Sherali Khan, residents of the Muhalla of Shah Ghazi Azim in Peshawar. These are brothers of Sharbat Ali Khan, the clerk of the Military Attache at Meshed. In the month of Babi 1 (Eebruary 1914), I left Peshawar with pilgrims on a pilgrimage to Mazar-i-Sharif. I had no passport hence I was placed in custody at Jelalabad by Syed Shahan, the Naib Salar, and was sent to Kabul under escort to the Naib-us-Saltaneh. On my arrival at Kabul I was not confined in custody but there was a sentry over me. I was given two krans a day as subsistence allowance. I received this allowance for the whole time that I stayed at Kabul and up to the time of my arrival at Chakansur. I alsoused to write prayers for people and earned money in this way. I was sent under escort from Kabul to Chakansur. I left Kabul on 27th Ramazan 1334 (28th July 1916) and came to Herat via Hazarajat on 15th Ziqad 34 (14th September 1916). I was in the custody of the Police till January 1917 as can be known from the copy of the letter from the Naib Salar of Herat I cannot suggest the reason why I was kept so long at Herat. Whenever I asked to be sent to Persia I received a reply that sowars were not available. I reached Kala Kang 22 days ago and left for Sistan after a stay of 16 days. Mohamed Akram, a Naib of the Persian army, had gone to the Gover nor of Chakansur for the case of Shamshuddin (a Persian complainant), and I accompanied him to Sistan. One of the horses now with me was given to me by Ain-ud-Dauleh, son of Amir Habibullah Khan, through Colonel Mohamed Sameh because I am a Syed and he did not like that I should travel on foot. The saddle which is new with me was also given with the horse. This horse is blind of one eye and is old. I bought the other horse from Haji Shah Mohamed Amin Aga, a Mujtahid at Besut in Hazarajat, Afghanistan, for 150 Kabuli rupees. I do not know anything about the Germans at Kabul because there was always a sentry on me and I was not allowed to go about. At Herat also I had no communication with Germans because I was in the custody of the Police the whole time. In Chakansur district I did not see any Germans. Naib Mohamed Akram of the Sistan army who had gone to the Governor had assured me after I had explained to him that I am a Persian and that the Afghan Government were deporting me to my country that he would intro duce me to Haji Shaikh Reza and Imam Juma, and they would introduce me to the Deputy Governor of Sistan and there would be no trouble for me. I had seen Mohamed Ali Khan Kiyani, the Deputy Governor of Mian Kangi, who happened to be at Milak (Sistan), and he had ordered one of his sowars to accompany me to Sistan. On my arrival at Lash Juwain Sher Ahmed Khan and Nur Ahmed Khan, nephews of Mohamed Umar Khan, the Governor of Lash Juwain, gave me a letter for Mohamed Sharif Khan, son of Mir Khan, resident of Iskel, Sistan, recommending him to help me because I am a Syed. I understand that Mohamed Sharif Khan is the maternal uncle of Sher Ahmed Khan and Nur Ahmed Khan. I did not see Mohamed Sharif Khan and the letter was not delivered to him. I had no intimacy with the nephews of Mohamed Umar Khan but because their relatives, Sardar Khan and a boy (brother of Sardar Khan), had emigrated to Shiraz and I knew them they treated me so kindly. I have retained a copy of the letter of the Naib Salar of Herat to the Deputy Governor of Chakansur which I now submit for perusal. SYED MUSTAEA. Enclosure No. 2. Further Statement of Syed Mustafa. I was born at Najaf. My mother was the daughter of Aga Sheikh Mahomed Raza, Afshar Bayat (by tribe), resident of Shiraz. I don’t know whether my father married my mother at Shiraz or Najaf because Aga Sheikh Mahomed Raza had gone to Najaf for study and after completing it he had been appointed “Peshlmam” at Najaf. He was dead when I was born. I was born five years after my father had married my mother. I was at Najaf till I was 7 years old and my father and mother were also there. My father was completing his studies, I came to Shiraz with my parents after my father had completed his studies.

From— Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes, K.C.I.E., Inspector- General, South Persia Rifles, T° The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of my despatch No. 1-C. of 1917 concerning the action of Pir-i-Zan on December 25th, 19lj. Owing to the uncertainty of the Mail Service, the favour of an acknowledgment is requested. Enclosure. No. 1-C., dated Shiraz, the 4th January 1917. From— Brigadier-General Sir P. M. Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Inspector- General, South Persia Rifles, To—The Chief of the General Staff. I have the honour to forward a report by Lieutenant-Colonel E. Twigo- describing the operations undertaken against the Pir-i-Zan Pass. 2. These operations were undertaken in the hope of overpowering the Nasir Divan, Kalantar of Kazerun and a noted firebrand, who on December the 17th treacherously attacked and captured the Kazerun Detachment of the South Persia Rifles. It appears that his act was partly dictated by his enmity to the Governor, but deeper than this is the hatred of control which would put an end to blackmail on passing caravans, and yet a further incentive was hostility to Indian troops who have been brought into conflict with the Tangistanis inhabiting the neighbourhood of Bushire. There is some probability that the Soulat-ud-Dola was aware of and supported this rising, but less likelihood that the Kavam-ul-Mulk was mixed up in it. The strong “ Democratic ” Party of Shiraz, one of whose leaders is Mirza Mustafa Khan, was most probably at the back of the rising, and as this individual had the Kavam almost completely under his influence use was probably made of the fact. In view of the extraordinary strength of the Pir-i-Zan position and the exceptionally heavy fall of snow which has since occurred, it is a subject for congratulation that the column did not proceed to Kazerun. Viewed as a reconnaissance in force the operations, but for the unfortunate loss of Captain Wittkugel, who was mortally wounded in a gallant attempt to clear the main ridge and whose rescue caused the other casualties, would have involved practically no losses, although, politically, the result of the retirement is unfavourable. 3. In consideration of the threatening position at Shiraz the balance of the column was concentrated round the Consulate and Telegraph Office, where the entire force is now quartered 4. To turn to Colonel Twigg’s report ; his force was shown to be wholly inadequate for the task of forcing the Pir-i-Zan Pass, in spifce of the gallantry displayed. His decision to retire by a night march to Khan-i-Zinian and the successful execution of this most difficult operation reflect much credit upon him. Had the Column waited for daylight its losses in men and transport would probably have been heavy owing to the ground lending itself to the tactics of the mobile hillmen. 5. I fully concur in all the recommendations made by Lieutenant-Colonel Twigg. Lieutenant-Colonel P. E, Hunter, Major S. M. Bruce and Major R. S. Rothwell all distinguished themselves in the fight with Jafar Kuli Khan near Ispahan and are exceptionally eificient and gallant officers, whose merits it is in the interests of the service to report. Captains G. H. Weldon and A. E. Wittkugel displayed remarkable gallantry under the most trying condi-Kazerun Column. tions, while Jemadar Bab Din showed a mixture of courage and judgment worthy of high praise.

Under instructions contained in Force Order No. 65, December 21st, 1916 (copy attached), the troops, as per margin, march ed to Chinarahdar on December 22nd. Owing to certain of the transport, intended for the Column, having been seized by the Kawam-uhMulk and to the delay in releasing it, I was unable to march on the 21st, as ordered. December 22nd.—-At 12 noon the Column marched to Chinarahdar a distance of 7 miles, and camped for the night east of the caravansarai. December 33rd —Jhe Column marched at 8 a.m., to Khan-i-Zinian, a distance oi 21 miles, and reached camp at 4 p.m. Here a junction was made with Major Bruce s Detachment consisting of 63 Lances 15th Lancers and the Machine Gun Section (2 guns) South Persia Eifles. Some difficulty was experienced in obtaining forage as the expected carawan from Shiraz did not arrive. The South Persia Kifies, not possessing tents, were distributed m an old caravansarai i mile east of the camn and in tne caravansarai next to camp. On the march to Khan-i-Zinian my Stan Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter, intercepted letters from Mohammad Ali Khan Kashgoli addressed to Pirman Pinna, Pat-ul-Mulk, Madabur-ul-Saltaneh and from Ardash” Khan Kashgoh to General Sykes and from Isfandary Khan, nephew of Mohammad Ali Khan Kashgoli, to Fazal-ul-Khan Muushi Bashi of His Britannic Majesty's Consulate, Shiraz; (2) the above letters were carried by Mohammad Ali Klian Khasgoli s Kaluntai Mulla Jawat. The tenor of these letters was that if help was immediately given to Mohammad Ali Khan the latter would be ready to assist the British m defeating Nasir-Divan, ali the letters accused the Solat-ud-Dowleh of being at the bottom of things. fAt Khan-i-Zinian one Haji Mujtalnd stated that he had power to answer for Mohammad Ali Khan that if the General Officer Commanding, etc., would ^ help Mohammad Ali Khan to become Governor of the Mahmasinihe was ready * to help in defeating Nasir-Divan. Mula Jawat reported that by orders Kawam-nl-Mulk and the Solat Fakr- us-Sultaneh, Gazunfa, Noor Mohammad, and other Dashtistan Khans were all helping Nasir-Fivan. Information that two British posts were looted at Kazerun was also obtained. The above information without comment was telegraphed to the Political Officer. Note.— It is now believed that these letters of Mohammad Ali Khan were but ruses to delay the Column. I also telegraphed to you stating that it was essential I should obtain immediate information whether Bushire force was going to co-operate with me On receipt of reassuring information re despatch of supplies from Shiraz I telegraphed to you that the Column w r ould march to Dhasht-i-Arjan on 24th of December. December 24th .—The combined Kazerun Column marched at 10 a m. to Dasht-i-Arjan, a distance of 11 miles, and reached camp at 3 p.m. The Camel Transport was returned to Chinarahdar with orders to load supplies there on the 15th and return to Khan-i-Zinian and to march to Dasht-i-Arjan on the 26th; South Persia Bides posts were instructed to supply escort. The failure of these orders to be carried out, probably due to treachery which I cannot prove, greatly influenced subsequent operations. The South Persia Bifles being without tents were placed in the Telegraph Office and the village wffiile the Indian troops and South Persia Bifles Mule Corps camped on the plain f of a mile distance so as to be out of ramee of the Dasht-i-Arjan hill. A picket of 20 South Persia Bifles Infantry was immediately posted on the hill above Dasht-i-Arjan and 15th Lancers under Major Bruce were sent some 6 miles the other end of the plain to the foot of the Pir-i-Zan Kotal to reconnoitre. On approaching Galou Khajeh post the cavalry were fired upon from the hills above apparently by few rifle men at 6 p m. I sent you the following telegram ;—“ Kazerun Column arrived Dasht-i-Arjan all correct ; no signs of the enemy on the way ; it is almost impossible to subsist my cavalry horses and transport animals here. Cavalry patrol pushed to foot of Kotal, 5 miles to the south-west of this camp ; both scouts and supports were fired on by the enemy apparently holding Kotal in small numbers. Information and all circumstances seem to point to our moving to Kazerun being our only proper course of action. I can there subsist force indefinitely. Please wire immediately definite orders whether I am to move to Kazerun or not, in default of orders to the contrary I will march to Mian Kotal to-morrow 25th. Please acknowledge.” In reply I received the following telegram :—“ Govern or-General is trying to arrange for Nasir-i-Divan to submit and until he refuses it is not at all desir able to proceed Kazerun which in case heavy snowfall or rising would be isolated from Shiraz. You may advance to Mian Kotal if supplies warrant your doing so. I think that you should do it in two stages leaving force at Dasht-i-Arjan if you consider necessary.” On receipt of above telegram I gave orders for the Column to march to Mian Kotal at 9 a.m. on the 25th. The reasons for this order were that from all information^yailable at the ' time the enemy did not appear to be more than 200 and most report]put them at 30 to 40 in number. From the enemy’s watch fire above us it appeared | that but a few men were lighting fires to deceive me as to their number. I had but five days’ rations for men and one day’s for animals and but little or no forage was obtainable in Dasht-i-Arjan. It seemed essential to push to Mian Kotal, from which commanding position supplies could have been foraged; the strongest arugment in favour of immediate action was that if given delay the enemy would collect and make my task impossible. At 11 p.m. my Staff Officer brought me information as to the natural strength of the position, also various rumours and reports, none of which I wasable to prove or disprove, and I decided to begin the march on the morrow by effecting a lodgment on the range about 2 miles south-west^ of Dasht-i-Arjan. The baggage was ordered to march at 10-30 in order to give time for this movement, which w 7 ould protect my flank. The Dasht-i-Arjan plain is about 6 miles long from north to south and 3 miles broad from east to west, entirely surrounded by precipitous, heavily wooded mountains The village and telegaph office of Dasht-i-Arjan, height 6,600 feet above the sea, lie close up under the northern barrier, which like the other mountains round the plain rises sheer up to a height of 9,( 00 to 10,000 feet. The road from Shiraz debouches from the difficult Tang i-Sufid about a mile to the east of the village, crosses the northern corner of the plain, turns south close under the cliffs of Dasht-i-Arjan and proceeds thence towards the Kotal-i-Pir-i-Zan which lies some 9 miles away to the south. To the east of the road, which gradually approaches nearer to the hills, towers the famous Pir-i-Zan position some 3,000 feet above the plain. To the west, at a distance of half a mile most of the plain is occupied by an impassable marsh ; it is possible to approach the Kctal by a path round the east side of the marsh, but this runs so close to the heavily forested hills that it would be dangerous for my force to follow it. The top 300 yards of all the ranges is devoid of cover and almost invariably capped by sheer cliffs from innumerable caves and holes in which a hidden enemy can Are with deadly effect on troops advancing. There are but three passable paths up the mountain from the plain. The whole Pir-i-Zan is some 8 miles long and is perhaps one of the most difficult positions to attack ; no one who has not actually tried to attack it could appreciate its difficulties. A glance at Survey of India sheets 10-0 and 17-C will give some slight idea of the position. The road md Mulla Nairn pass leading as it does over two very difficult passes both occupied by the rebel inhabitants of Kaluni and Ahdui, was considered inadvisable as the enemy would still have been in possession of the key to Kazerun, the Pir-i- Zan. At 8-30 a.m. the 15th Lancers pushed on towards the foot of the Kotal-i- Pir-i-Zan. At 9 a.m. I detached one section 124th Baluchis and one company (118 all ranks) South Persia Rifles Infantry with orders to effect a lodgment on the nearest point of the Pir-i-Zan range and then march along the top parallel with the main, force below. The main body marched in the following order :— One company 124th Balchis, one section 23rd Mountain Battery, Maxim Gun Section South Persia Rifles; one section 3rd South Persia Rifles Mountain Battery, with a rear-guard of 10 Cavalry South Persia Rifles; the baggage remained in camp. At 9-30 am. the 23rd Mountain Battery moved up on the right of the Infantry with the South Persia Rifles maxims and artillery at about 10 yards interval on the risrht and the force moved slowly down the valley waiting for the movements of the South Persia Rifles flank detachment to develope. At 10 a.m. Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter galloped up to say that the flank ing detachment had been fired on, and at the same time I heard Major Bruce’s Cavalry in action at the far end of the valley. At 10-30 a.m. the South Persia Rifles Infantry not having appeared on the heights and the sound of desultory firing being heard, I ordered Major Roth well, Commanding, 23rd Mountain Battery, as an encouragement to the South Persia Rifles Infantry to put a couple of shells into the high ridge distant 3,500 yards at a small group of the enemy. At 11-30 no sign of the flank detachment being obtainable, I ordered the 124th and the 23rd Mounter Battery to halt and. not commit themselves to the action at the Kotal until I could clear up the fate of the South Persia Rifles Infantry. Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter took the South Persia Rifles Mountain Battery into action on a low hill close above an old ruined caravansarai about 5 miles from Dasht-i-Arjan and two from the foot of the Kotal, in order to assist if possible the South Persia Rifles Infantry. The range of the small 7-pounders was found to be quite insufficient and the quality of the ammunition so uncertain that it was dangerous to use the gun to fire over infantry.At 12 noon the South Persia Pifles Infantry and the section 124th re turned to the main body, having been quite unable to force their way up owing to physical difficulties, the treachery of the guides, the indifferent behaviour of most of the South Persia Rifles Infantry. Captain Weldon tried time and | again to rally the men but couldn’t. At 12-30 p.m. Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter reported that he would send up the South Persia Rifles again, and asked for support from the 234th Mountain Battery; at the same time he brought the South Persia Rifles Machine^ Guns into action to support the second attempt by the South Persia Rifles Infantry. I now joined the South Persia Rifles on the hill above the caravan- sarai and directed a section of 124th Baluchis under Jamadar Babu Bin to take the 1st peak and ridge above this hill as the enemy appeared to be still in possession of it. In the meantime Captains Weldon and Wittkugel pushed forward with the rallied South Persia Rifles towards what appeared to be a feasible way up the hill. Colonel Hunter went forward. At 1 p.m. with the two maxims to support this attack, whilst I ordered up Major Rothwell’s two guns and two platoons of infantry to the hill, which I now made my Headquarters, and a steady artillery fire was opened on the front for which the South Persia Rifles seemed to be making. The extra- | ordinary difficulty of the ground, heavily forested and intersected by huge clefts, chasms and covered with enormous boulders many the size of an ordinary house made communication between units impossible and all men advancing were almost immediately lost to sight. 1 At 2-40 I received information from Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter whose maxims I could hear in action, that the section of 124th Baluchis had lost their way and w^ere out of reach away to the right. He asked for artillery fire on the cliffs to the right and for more Indian infantry in support of his maxims as the South Persia Rifles men were few. He also asked for water. I imme diately despatched a platoon of 124th under Captain Hinde to support the advanced line. At 3-10 I received the following message from Colonel Hunter:—“Will you please send up Icdian Infantry at once and open fire all along the right hand ciihs with Rothwell’s guns. The enemy have discovered that my machine guns are not supported by infantry and are gathering in some numbers to take them by a rush when night falls. Ho you please he quick as night is coming on and we cannot get on with the 6 men with Weldon, all that is left of the Gendarmes.” As I had already sent up Captain Hinde the desired artillery fire was at once given. At 3-45 I received the following message from Captain Hinde :—“ We are held up here by at least 50 men ; reports from Scouts I sent forward put the number even higher. There is very little cover here and the enemy are in position at the top of a precipice which is about 300 to 400 yards from us. I can see no way pp, and as any movement on our part draws fire I am eva cuating this nullah and going back into the trees, the guide has disappeared at the moment we caught a rather heavy fire when doubling across open. There is no road here cr indeed anything approaching a path, and I doubt even if there was no enemy if we could get up much further We had great difficulty getting as far as this.” I then sent an order to Captain Hinde to retire on the camp, and gave orders for the baggage to go into camp close to the ruined caravansarai. Whilst in process of giving these orders I received the following message from Colonel Hunter from the 1st peak :—“ Wittkugel has been wounded and several Gendarmes reported also wounded. Unless you keep up the artillery fire and send help we can’t get Wittkugel out. I am going up with 1 machine gun to try and doit, but these Gendarmes are useless.” At about 4-45 I received the following message from Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter :—“ Wittkugel dangerously, if not fatally, wounded I got to him, lost two men wounded doing it, and was too weak to carry him away. His back is broken. Send immediately cartridges for machine gun. We have none.Send Indian to help before dark Tell the guns to fire at the corner, not to the right as at present.” This message was also addressed to Captain Weldon with the request that he come at once with the other machine gun and cartridges. I immediately sent up ah South Persia Rifles Maxim mule with cartridges and an escort. I at once kad the artillery target changed and afterwards learned, with great effect J sent an order to Major Bruce to send 15 dismounted sowars to act as escort to the guns and sent up to the top my last remaining platoon of 124th Infantry under Captain Chaldecott and Major Devere Condon with a stretcher party Night now came on, and I ordered Major Bruce to post a cavalry picket on Headquarter hill north-west of the caravansarai, and, as there was considerable firing to be heard, I sent up a section of Captain Hinde’s platoon to assist the bringing down of the wounded. Since no target could be seen and the position of the parties still out was uncertain the guns ceased fire after having steadily been in action for 6 hours, firing without ceasing a total of 178 rounds from the two guns. This practically finished the engagement. At 8-80 p.m. the wounded and most cf the parties had returned safely to camp, but one Indian officer and 19 men 194th Infantry and one Persian officer and about 20 men, South Persia Rifles who had been drawn away to the right in the first attacks on the position, were still out and for some time distant firing indicated that they were holding their own. It was quite impos sible to support them or to locate them owing to distance and darkness. Information was now received through Chahhadars, South Persia Rifles officers, and spies that the enemy had been strongly reinforced and were about to send 200 men to cut the road behind us at Dasht-i-Arjan and Sineh Safid, both impossible positions to force with my small column. At the same time various South Persia Rifles officers warned Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter to be on the look-out for treachery on the part of others of the South Persia Rifles. 20 men of the South Persia Rifles Artillery were reported as deserted and others as havins: gone over to the enemy. The fires on the hillsides indicating the enemy’s positions, some 2,000 to 3,000 yards distant, gradually came lower and more and more encircled the camp. No news was received of the promised and anxiously expected convoy of forage and the animals had no barley and but one feed of Indian baled bhosa left. The force at my disposal was quite inadequate to the task given it and I decided to march at once for Khan-i-Zinian, 18 miles distant, before I was completely surrounded. At this moment the enemy crept up in the dark from the south to a distance of some 150 yards from camp and made a bold attack on the Column. The cool behaviour of the 124th Infantry picket and the 15th Lancer picket, who immediately returned the fire from a few yards’ range, together with the moral effect of a star shell from the artillery and a well-placed shell into a distant set of fires, drove off this attack. The immediate desertion of practically all the Persian muleteers and the flight towards Lasht-i-Arjan of many of our camels and mules made it unavoidable to leave behind some forage and a few tents, as the muleteers carried off the loading ropes with them. Orders were given for the evacuation of the vallev. The South Persia Rifles, to a man, went off within a few minutes of the order; not waiting for the issue of detailed orders of march, and this incident confirmed the sus picions (which afterwards proved not justified) that we might possibly find our late comrades in action against us when we reached Dasti-i-Arjan and Sineh Safid. The South Persia Rifles went off at 10-30 p.m., and the remainder of the Column marched quietly away at 1 a..m. on the 26th. Had it not been for the cowardice and desertion of the muleteers and camelmen, not a particle of baggage would have been lost. The retirement was most orderly and the morale of the troops excellent, but until our arrival at Dasht-i-Arjan at 3-30 a.m. to find it in occupation of the South Persia Rifles, the march was not without great anxiety.9 At Dasht-i-Arjan I gave orders for tlie South Persia Rifles to accom pany the Clolumn to Khan-i-Zinian, whereupon some confusion took place and many of the muleteers threw off the loads from the mules and galloped off with the mules. In the dark some looting was done, probably by villagers, but the whole force, with its wounded, was got safely over the Sineh Safid by 6 a.m. on the 26th and continued its march to Khan-i-Zinian, where it arrived at 9*30 a.m. The posts of Sineh Safid and near by were attacked by the enemy at 9 a.m* and Dasht-i-Arjan with its South Persia Rifles pickets, who had been unable to accompany the South Persia Rifles as ordered, was taken and their rifles seized. At 1 a.m. Jamadar Pab Din and 19 men of the 124th Baluchistan Infantry returned safely to camp, having had a most adventurous experience and bring ing in 3 cavalry horses and rifles with other property lost during the night attack. At midnight on December 26th-27th the Camp was again attacked by a party of 40 to 50 enemy horsemen w r ho were easily driven off by the pickets. No supplies being found at Khan-i-Zinian, it was necessary to retire to Cbinarahdar, which was reached at 4 p.m, on December 27th. Six miles from camp the Column was met by the Wireless Section, who were ordered to return to Shiraz, and shortly afterwards I reported to you on the road. On the 28th December the Column returned to Shiraz. In a fight of this description, where a position which would require a division to properly attack and where communication is almost impossible, there must have been numerous incidents which will never come to light. Tbe enemy were determined and excellent marksmen and, did not waste a shot. In a few moments my tiny force was swallowed up by the intricacies of the ground, and I consider that all ranks of the Indian troops behaved splendidly in an impossible position. Those of the South Persia Rifles who fought (about l-3rd) fought ? bravely and deserve the highest praise for their gallantry. The action would | have ended about 3 pm. but the wounding of Captain Wittkugel made it imperative to continue it. As I was unable to see the details of the action owing to the great extent and intricacy of the position, I attach Lieutenant- Colonel Hunter’s report and fully endorse all he says. I attach (1) Copies of casualties reports. (2) Abstract of expenditure of ammunition. I beg to bring to your favourable notice the following individuals who particularly distinguished themselves by gallant or skilful conduct or both and request that my recommendations may have your sanction. (1) Throughout the operations Lieutenant-Colonel Prederick Eraser Hunter performed the duties of the Staff Officer to the Column in a most efficient manner, and afforded me the greatest assistance. I would especially commend to your notice the skilful and very gallant conduct of this officer when directing the fire of tbe South Persia Rifles Machine Gun Section, which he first brought into action in support of the right flanking movement detailed in my report, and subsequently very efficiently made use of to cover the withdrawal of the wounded. I would further submit that the very intrepid behaviour of Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Eraser Hunter in his gallant attempt to bring in Captain A. E. Wittkugel, who was lying in the open desperately wounded, appears to be worthy of some special mark of appreciation. (2) Major S. M. Bruce, 15th Lancers, in his usual cool and efficient manner carried out the work of reconnaissance by day and protected ofer rear by night. The behaviour of his squadron was excellent. (3) Major R. S Rothwell, R. A., and his two guns certainly prevented a failure to carry out the impossible from becoming into disaster. The shooting of this section was magnificient. To Major Rothwell’s Battery I10 attribute largely the safe withdrawal of the wounded and the successful driving off of two night attacks. (41 Jemadar Bab Din, 124th Baluchistan Infantry, in the absence of guides became separated in the process of fighting from the main attack and found himself at nightfall ignorant of what was happening. He sargared his party and fought through the night, bringing his men and some beleaguered South Persia Bifles safely hack to camp in the morning. Here he discovered, from kit abandoned, the direction m which the Column had ictired He fought a rear-guard action for five miles, replenished his ammunition from a box abondoned by muleteers, and safely crossed the Smell Sufiu pass before it was attacked by the enemy. For great gallantry and judgment m leading his men I recommend him for the Indian Order of Merit, 2nd class. (5) I would also draw your attention to the recommendations made on page 12 of Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter’s report which as stated above I lully endorse. L/(yw' (L AnrrrnM DTU-T.’ZA'W FARS? PERSIA.

Hunter, 21st Lancers, Staff Officer, Com manding South Persia Rifles, Kazerun Column, To—The Officer Commanding, Kazerun Column. I have the honour to report as to the operatious of the South Persia Rifles under my command in the action at Pir-i-Zan on Xmas day, 1916. At 9 a.m. I gave the following orders to Captain Weldon:— One Section Indian Infantry, One Company South Persia Rifles, will march at once to take the ridge above the road leading to Kaleh Mushir, using the first good way up. 2. Guns, if necessary, will support you from below.' 3. On arrival at top move along parallel with main force below in plain to high hump circumstances will dictate further orders. 4. The whole force will endeavour to reach Mian Kotal to-night. At 10 a.m., whilst extending at the foot of the low hills two miles south-west of Dasht-i-Arjan, Captain Weldon’s Detachment was fired on. After starting them up the hill through the woods I reported the incident to you. At 11-30 a.m. Captain Weldon’s party not having appeared and as consi derable firing could be heard behind the 1st ridge I took the South Persia Rifles guns into action on hill near the old ruined caravansarai, 5 miles from Dast-i-Arjan and endeavoured to splatter the cliffs above with shrapnel; all of the shells fell short, the range being 3,000 yards. At 12 noon Captain Weldon returned and reported that owing to having run up against a most difficult piece of ground strongly held by the enemy he was quite unable to get sufficient of the South Persia Rifles Infantry to face the task. Time and again he tried to get them to advance but failed. At 1 some 40 or 50 South Persia Rifles Infantry having been collected Captains Wittkugel and Weldon volunteered to try and get up to the top by a feasible path which we could see. I then asked you for artillery support and brought up the South Persia Rifles maxims to replace the useless guns. At 1 p.m., after you had establishedf your Headquarters on “ Caravasari hill,” I started forward with machine guns to support the South Persia Rifhs Infantry and the section of 124th Baluchis, all of whom had disappeared in the forest or nullahs, and in order to clear the 1st Peak Ridse from which a few bullets were being directed at your Headquarters. At 1-40 CaptainWeldon’s small party and the maxims had cleared the peak and the left spur from it of the enemy and were ready for a final rush up the last 300 yards of the hill to the top. Here, however, we came under a very dangerous fire from enemy closely hidden in the rocks above and time after time when we had collected a few South Persia Hides Infantry and started forward the men would disappear. I now sent 1 maxim to the peak to replace the few infantry there and having collected 6 men tried to get them to join Captain Weldon, who had got forward close to the path with 1 man At 2 p.m. I sent a message asking for some artillery fire on the cliffs above and for some Indian Infantry to make the final rush ; away in the distance on the right I could hear firing and took this to be the section of 124th sent up some time before you. Neither Captain Weldon nor myself could locate Captain Wittkucel, though we supposed him to be on our leit. Whilst waiting for the Indian Infantry the maxims took several ranges and searched some ground over which the expected advance would take place. Several attempts were made by the enemy to get the South Persia Rifles to come over to their side, and finally when the enemy discovered that my maxima had no infantry support the enemy collected in some number to take them by a rush at nightfall. As time was getting short I sent at 2-40 a message asking you to hurry up the 124th supports as besides the 8 men with the maxims Captain Web!on and myself only had 6 South Persia Rifles with All this time any exposure whatever brought a very accurate fire upon us. At about 3 I saw a platoon of 124th Infantry try to emerge from the woods and advance up the hill some 6 0 yards to my left and 300 to left of the only road. A very heavy fire by numerous enemy was immediately poured into the 124th, who were unable to advance owing to cliffs in front. I w r as personally at the maxim at the time and had the satisfaction of knock ing over several of the enemy who in their excitement to get at the 124th rather recklessly exposed themselves I now sent the 6 South Persia Rifles Infantry with me over to Captain Weldon, who w r as between the maxims and 124th and on the road, and, sending order to the other maxim on the peak above to support us, unshipped the gun from its mounting and started to help Captain Weldon up to the top. By this time both of us realised the seriousness of the tactical sit nation and the absolute necessity forgetting a footing on the top before dark*. As we were moving over towaids our left twx&gt; South Persia Rifles Infantry and an Assistant Surgeon, South Persia Rifles, rushed up to me with news that Captain Wittkugel had been wounded and some South Persia Rifles killed and at the same moment a heavy fire opened on Weldon and the maxims, so I knew we must give up hope of taking the ridge before dark. I called to Weldon to come across and up the hill to help me to get Captain Wittkugel out, and giving orders to the maxim to follow', started up the hill with the two men who had brought the news. As usual the remainder disappeared and I arrived at the top with two men and the Hospital Assistant. One man was ? almost at once shot but the Hospital Assistant and the other reached the rock from which 50 yards further up, clean out in the open within 100 yards of the enemy’s hidden shelters, we could see a wounded South Persia Rifleman and nearby Captain Wittkugel. As the maxim had not arrived I called out to Wittkugel that we would come and help him on being assured by the wounded man near him that the Sahib is still alive. On the arrival of the gun instructions were given that it should fire bursts of fire at the face of the rock, from w hence the enemy’s fire seemed to come whenever I called out to them to do so. We never did discover where the enemy were, although they were apparently about 100 yards distant above us. With remaining infantryman following I crept out. When the enemy had fired the maxim was told to fire and we made little rushes and after what seemed ages got to Captain Wittkugel. He said his hack w r as broken and that he could not live and asked me to request the General Officer Commanding to look after his wife. As he is a heavy man I was unable to move him, so called to Vakil Sayed Abdulla Khan, who w T as following me to help ; he was shot immediately he rose. The wounded man No. 267 Ismail lying close beside Captain Wittkugel now attempted to help hut was shot immediatelyfro® H iDtrj iiiel? ik 11 M A V^ n , ext ai 1 te . m P t to m °. v e him a bullet splintered on the o k Wrttkugei s head was lying on and a splinter apparently wounded me m the arm and Captain Wittkugel in the eye. ^ 1 + 1 ii time th ?

An hour or so passed by when Captain Weldon appeared with the second maxim and ammunition. The gunner carrying the tripod was killed^ or ^wounded before reaching the top but the cartrido’es ro 011 ! J ell ?; ed sl J ua ^ 011, ^ about 6 p.m. the welcome sight of Captain Chaldecott and a platoon of 124tb raised a cheer from us all and about this time too the guns got the exact target. One man of the 124th was severely wounded reaching the top but in spite of the very accurate fire from the enemy we got the platoon into place beside the maxims and prepared to open a very heavy nre on the rocks in front to cover a rush by a stretcher party under Major De Vere Condon, I.M.S. About this time No 633 Muhammad p ou fh Persia Rifles, made a very gallant rescue of a wounded man and then immediately volunteered to accompany Major Condon and myself with the stretcher party to recover Captain Wittkugel. As we w T ere now in some danger of being taken in rear from a peak 6^0 yards away to the north previously held by the enemy, Naib Mohammad laghi Khan Arab, South Persia Rifles, volunteered to return to the 1st peak, pick up a few South Persia Rifles there and then hold the dangerous peak until we had retired. This he did under heavy fire and it was not until far into the night he was able to return safely to camp. , Both machine guns and the 124th Infantry now opened a hot fire on the face of the cliff and a rush was made for Captain Wittkugei, and, in spite of a hot fire, we were able to get him and the other wounded away without further loss. The maxims now retired to 1st peak to cover the subsequent retreat of the 124th and the w ounded. Captain Chaldecott held the position until the bark of the maxims enabled him to give a last burst of fire before retiring. The guns had ceased firing for some time. None of us who did that long toilsome descent, burdened with a heavy wounded man on a stretcher, crashing into trees and rocks, escaping precipices in the dark will easily forget it. The maxims went first and held positions to cover the 124th who protected our rear. The 124th, as the South Persia Rifles and bearers became exhausted, were more and more called in as bearers. On all sides the enemy’s fires came nearer and every few moments shots were heard close by. The slow progress took two hours to accomplish, the casualties having occurred 3,000 feet above the camp and at a distance of 2J miles away. By 8-30 p m. camp was reached. At about 10 p.m. the camp was attacked and I am glad to report that the Maxim Gun Section immediately doubled out with their guns to the portion of the perimeter given them. I attach (1) List of Casualties by Dr. Wollatt, the South Persia Rifles Surgeon. I may say that of the 200 South Persia Rifles in action some 60 fought gallantly as any troops could have done. The Maxim Battery was consistently to the front and time and again stood as an example round wdiich the others could rally. The casualties represent 25 per cent, of the men constantly engaged, and it is fair to those men of the South Persia Rifles to say that from 10 a.m. to 8-30 p m. those same men bore the brunt of the fighting.14 Where all were gallant, it is hard to distinguish hut I would specially recommend to your notice Captains Weldon and Wittkugel for their^ great bravery in rallying their men time after time and pushing on and up m an attempt to win to the top. For hours, separated from help, constantly being deserted by most of their men at the most critical moments, these two officers gallantly assisted by the men of the South Persia Rifles Machine Guns who were beyond praise in their steadiness, stuck to their impossible task till niMit and losses defeated them. Captain Weldon, although exhausted himself, afterwards carried a wounded man 2|- miles down the mountain. Captain Wittkugel was mortally wounded but 100 yards from the enemy s last position and 200 yards from the top. I strongly recommend both these officers for the Military Cioss. Maior deYere Condon, and Captain Chaldecott, 124th Infantry, deserve great credit for the gallant way in which thoy aided onr efforts to carry awav the wounded and to Major Condons great caie and skill and to the men of the Army Bearer Corps, South Persia Rifles bearers, and 124th Infantry is due the fact, that despite the misery of that descent in the dark, the wounded arrived alive in the camp. I would also biing to youi notice the names of the following men who in the final rush to bung off the wounded came forward with Major Condon and myself as stretcher party :— 4463 Lance Naik Raja Khan, 124th Baluch Infantry. 4566 Sepoy Sultan Khan. 4607 Ndai Singh, 108th Indian Pield Artillery, Army Bearer Corps. 5919 Harka Bahadur, Indian Field Artillery, Army Bearer Corps. 9797 Dhanbir, Indian Field Artillery, Army Bearer Corps.

The German prisoners at Shiraz had escaped (noit afterwards confirmed). Shazada Hussain was still delaying with the prisoners at Sirjan. Considerable unrest and nervousness was felt throughout the district of Kerman where reports of Turkish successes were being greatly exaggerated. The following Columns were at that time on the road from Bunder Abbas :— (1; Escort for prisoners at Daulatabad. Strength reported British officer Staff Officer wire of 17th August 1916. and File, 108th In fantry, 40. (2) Beinforcements, left Bunder Abbas 7th August, strength reported about 200.

General Sykes on the 18th August. As Shazada Hussain was still delaying with the prisoners at Sirjan, and as neither money nor letters seemed likely to move him, I decided to send one of the two British officers at my disposal to Sirjan with additional escort to conduct the prisoners to Baft or until escort was met with, as the continued presence of the prisoners at Sirjan was a source of danger. I wired to Bunder Abbas asking for the exact strength of the Columns, the amount of supplies with each, and the number of Transport animals. Officer Comminding, Bunder Abbas, No. 242, 19th August. (In this report these attached ( 2 ). columns will be referred to as :— (1) Lieutenant Smith’s Column, original escort for prisoners. (2) Lieutenant Fraser’s Column, Beinforcements.

Captain Merill with 9 South Persia Bifles (old gendarmes) and 50 sowars from the Deputy Governor, Sirdar Nosrat, left for Sirjan.

This information was at once sent down the Attached (4). road, with orders that the leading column should halt at Daulatabad until the last Column, that of Captain Wagstaff, joined up, and then all proceed together to Baft. 27th August. —On the 27th a report was received from Captain Merrill, Offlc, Commanding, Reman, nine of 27th. date i ? ir 3 an &gt; tlle 23 ! d ’ that 0n Ms arrival tt . at Sirjan, the prisoners together with ilussain Khan, a Bochagchi Khan, and Shazada Hussain and a following of about 50 horse and foot had fled. They were reported to be making for Balvard. Merrill arrived with only the 9 South Persia Rifles men, the Sirdar Nosrat s men having failed to keep with him. Immediate pursuit was impossible and the^local authorities would give no help. The prisoners had been allowed to mix freely with the people of Sirjan and this, coupled with | the reports from the north had affected the whole town and district against us. j Captain Merrill’s position was a very difficult one and not unaccompanied with personal danger, but he set to work to raise levies and at the same time sent word to the Columns on the road to hasten to Sirjan with all speed. On the news of the escape of the prisoners reaching Kerman rewards Attached (5). were inimediatlely offered for their cap ture in consultation with His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and information was sent down the road and instructions that the leading column was not to proceed beyond Baft till Wagstaff’s Column joined up with it, the whole force was to be ready to move on Sirjan if required. The situation was reported to General Sykes. 28th August. —Purther reports received from Captain Merrill stating Oflke.-, Commanding Kerman, No. 164 of 28th ^ the . escaped prisoners Were at Balyai'd September 1916 and No. 166 of 29th September and urging the necessity Of Sending trOOpS 1916 .

Purther instruc tion were sent to Captain Wagstaff directing him to park the convoy at Baft with strong escort and to move with the rest of his force on Sirjan. 30th August. —On the 30th August news was received from Lieutenant , . . , . _ /fr\ Praser that his Column had arrived at Baft Fraser s report. Attached (7J. ,. 00 i.i ii.ij.-i • j_ on the 28th and that he was moving on to Negar for reasons given in his report which is attached. I consider his move was justified in view of the report he had received from Captain Merrill. On receiving this news the following courses were open. (1) to direct Lieutenant Praser to return to Baft. (2) To sanction his proposed move from Negar to Sirjan. (3) To order him to stand fast at Negar. (4) To direct him to come into Kerman. Taking into account that my instructions could not reach Lieutenant Praser before he arrived at Kegar and considering the size of the convoy (some 600 camels) and its important nature (arms, ammunition and specie) I did not think it advisable to order him to return to Baft. Nor did I think it safe for Lieutenant Praser’s force, weakened by the escort which he must detail to accompany the convoy to Kerman, to move direct from Negar to Sirjan, an unknown road to him, and with his flank exposed to attack from the Bochagchi. His remaining inactive at Negar appeared to me to have no advantages. I therefore sent orders to Lieutenant „ ,i 1*0 * „ , Praser to come into Kerman with all October (September?) 1916 . speed. These orders reached him atAegar on the 1st September and he immediately left Negar and arrived at Kerman on the 2nd September. The same day (30th August) I sent a letter to Wagstaff informing him of the situation and directing him to move acie ‘ from Baft, together with Smith’s Column, on Sirjan if he considerd such move safe. The situation was reported to th eOfficer Commanding, Kertmn, August. Chief of the General Staff and General No. 170 of 3is 0 Sykes. In the meantime Merrill’s posi tion at Sirjan was critical and unless immediate steps were taken to overawe the district by a show of force Hossain Khan and the escaped prisoners might obtain a considerable following. 2nd September.

It was not clear from this telegram where Chief of the General Staff intended the concentra tion should take place. In any case to concentrate the Column, either by Kerman till Wagstaff’s Column arrived or by i 9 i 6 . mmanding ’ Kerman ’ N0,180 of 3rd 0cto ber sending k’raser back to meet Wagstaff, would have meant a delay of 7 to 10 days lelore the Columns so concentrated could move on Sirian. Delay appeared most inadvisable. I consideied that it would be running no undue risk to send Lieutenant Erasers Column from Kerman to Sirjan while Captain Wagstaff’s Column (joined with Smith s) moved from Baft to Sirjan. It was hoped that the two co umns converging from different points would confuse Hussain Khan and ave t ie desired effect upon the district. I did not consider it likely that ussam Khan would attack either column, as the strength of Column moving m ejs ' a is always very largely exaggerated and at that time Hussain Khan was reported to have a following of only about 150 men. Merrill had by this ime collected some 2 (j 0 to 300 levies though these w r ere of very doubtful qua i y and without the support of regular troops could not be counted upon. , was ^iculated that the two Columns should reach Sirjan about the same day. I therefore issued orders accordingly. September.

Wagstaff’s foice reached Mohamedabad evening 8th and on the 9th moved to Dhanu, 3 farsaks from Balvard, where he first heard of the flight of Hussain Khan from Balvard. Fraser arrived Saidahad after sunset on the 10th, and hearing the news irom Mei rill at once set off in pursuit with his 30 Cavalry and some 50 Persian g &gt;w ars, to try to cut off the escaping prisoners. He reached Zavaree well19 Commanding, Kerman, No. 245, tem'o«ar 1^16. Sykes* No. 6t8«C, 13 (thirteen) farsaks from Saidabad by noon on the 11th, having travelled all night. Here ^ he learned that Hussain Khan had passed in the early hours in the morning. His horses were exhausted and being without rations and the levies having failed to Keep with him he was forced to abandon the ^ pursuit and returned to Malikabad which he reached the morning of the 12th. Lieutenant Gosh, I.M.S , accompanied Eraser throughout this ride. 1 consider this night ride of Lieutenant Eraser’s over a rough and unknown country, starting as he did immediately after a march of 8 farsaks into Saidabad and that at the end of a month’s continuous marching from the coast, a very fine performance. The pursuit was now abandoned and the column concentrated at Saidabad. On receiving this report on the 6th I considered pursuit into Ears by so small a force would be unduly risky and probably fruitless, especially after the delay which must elapse before my orders could reach Sirjan. (Mes- Commanding.

I was of the opinion that withdrawal dated i9th Sep- from Sirjan under the circumstances would be unwise : the town and district were still hostile and a withdrawal would look like an acknowledgment of defeat and would leave the coast clear for Hussain Khan and the prisoners to return to Sirjan where, after the withdrawal of our troops, they would pro bably have been able to collect a strong following, if not raise the whole country against us. This opinion I set forth in my telegram to General Sykes’ No. 260 of 21st of September. 22nd September. —On the 22nd General Sykes’ telegram No. 665 was received directing that the reinforcements Sykes* No. 665, dated 22 ud September 1916 . should be withdrawn and sent to Yezd Orders were accordingly despatched to Captain Whigstaff to this effect. These orders were despatched on the 23rd and reached Sirjan on the 27th. These are the events which lead up to the engagement which took place at Saidabad on the 28th, and reported in Commanding, Kermat., No. 317, dated 3rd Oct- my telegram No. 317 of 3rd October, ober 1916. 3rd October. —The engagement was brought about by a bold attempt on the part of Hussain Khan and the prisoners to get possession of the town of Saidahad, no doubt hoping thereby to establish considerable prestige. A full report of this engagement is set forth in Captain Wagstaff’s report No. 18 which I attach. Hussain Khan entered the town of Saidabad with a small following secretly on the night of 27th-28th September, undoubtedly they were sure of their reception there. Wagstaff’s force was camped in a garden outside of the town. On receiving the news of Hussain Khan’s arrival Captain Wagstaff surrounded the town and commenced an attack at dawn. Our troops had to attack across the open against the enemy who were holding the walls and towers of the town. Wagstaff estimated the enemy at 300 rifles. Our forces were 27 Ca valry, 200 Infantry, and the levies who however took very little part in the fight. We had also a mountain gun and an ancient brass, muzzle-loading cannon. From all reports received the Indian troops led by their British officers showed great gallantry in this attack where the odds were greatly against them. The engagement lasted all day and by evening the Infantry had worked up close to the walls of the town and the mountain gun had been got up to within 250 yards and was fired point blank. The cavalry on the northern side had actually got a footing in the town itself.20 At sunset Hussain Khan seeing things becoming dangerous made a sudden dash from the town with some 20 horsemen and got away in the dusk. Ihe defence now collapsed, the defenders sneaking away by night or hiding themselves in the town and burying their arms. 3 . ^ tvt ooo d .u.

( 2 nd Kajputs), South Persia Rifles. For his sound dispositions and successful attack with numerically inferior force against the walled town of Saidabad on the 28th September. Although the attack did not result m the recapture of the prisoners it undoubtedly went a long wav to establishing our prestige in the district. ° J j Lieutenant Fraser. (15th Lancers). This officer successfully escorted a large and unweildy convoy of arms and ammunition over a difficult and dangerous road from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and although followed by bands of Baharlus bis dispositions prevented their attacking and looting the convoy. This officer also made a very energetic attempt to cut off the escap ing prisoners on the night Btlwth September riding some 40 miles in the dark in unknown country and followed by only 30 sowars. Captain Merrill. South Persia Bifles For his energy in raisino- levies at Sirjan and for the bold front he showed when alone without support fcr several weeks in very difficult circumstances. All reports agree that all officers and Indian troops showed great gallantry under fire in the attack on Saidabad on the 28th September. I should like also to mention Lieutenant Fowle (15th Lancers), South Persia Bifles, for his excel lent work in training and organizing the South Persia Bifles at Kerman. It is greatly due to the energies of this officer that the South Persia Bifles are now a very promising force of about 600 men. G. L. FAB BAN, Major, {4th Cavalry I. A.)

Your chit wire of yesterday. ^ # I am taking the following action to meet the situation m this district 1 JJe the 'prisoners. I am sending an officer, Captain Merrill at once to Sirian with extra 25 men to force prisoners and escort to Baft. I consider immediate action absolutely necessary as no letters or money will more Shazada Hussain, and the presence of the prisoners at Sirjan is a source of danger Captain Merrill will hand prisoners orer to escort at Baft. Ihis also will saye time of reinforcements. s ^ , 2 . I consider situation demands entire change m our methods here. At present we are working to raise a permanent disciplined force. This force tan be of no military value for at least a year. Your telegram reports Germans raising forces in Bars and presumably these are of some fighting propose immediately to cease enlisting and training South Persia Rifles as we now understand it and to devote all energy and money to subsidising tribesmen. These would not be a permanent or disciplined force but would have some immediate fighting value and might afterwards be trained on our 6 Rumour reports Germans moving on Sirjan. This place is an important out-post to Kerman and tribal centre. To counter and forestall such move I am with the help of the Sirdar subsidising 300 tribesmen there. Captain Merrill will take these over on his return from Baft and will remain temporarily at Sirian. Another 100 tribesmen will be collected at Baft. I am loath to part 'with one of the only two officers with me, but consider the situation demands it. . In town itself I have taken over charge of the artillery and Sirdar is arranging to get me at once 200 horsemen and camelmen m addition to the present garrison. I will gather more if I consider it necessary. I am offerino- Ts. 15 including rations and forage to tribesmen but may have to oive more to outbid Germans.^ I would suggest that a substantial sum be given to the head of each tribe u hich sends in men. &amp; I have consulted Consul who is in full accord with me.

Memorandum, dated Kerman, the 20th August 1916. From— Major G. L. Farran, Commanding South Persia Rifles, Kerman, To— Captain Waqstaff, South Persia Rifles (2nd Rajput Infantry). 1. With regard to the prisoners :— I do not know what orders and counter-orders you may have had. Owing to changes in the situation orders re the prisoners have had to be changed several times. I have now definite orders from General Sykes that the prisoners are to be sent down to Bunder Abbas, if it can be safely managed and not brought into Kerman. These orders cancel any previous orders you may have receiyed. The prisoners are reported to have left Sirjan for Baft under a Persian escort on the 16th instant. This report is unconfirmed, I have sent an officer, Captain Merrill, to Sirjan to ascertain if the prisoners have left and if not to take them at once to Baft. You will in this ease not have to proceed to Sirjan, as I understand were your original orders. Captain Merrill should reach Sirjan about the 23rd or 24th August. On meeting the prisoners at Baft or elsewhere on the road you will take them over and have them escorted to Bunder Abbas by the 108th Infantry. Again I do not know what orders you have, but you must use your own discretion as to whether you accompany the prisoners yourself or not. The escort must of course be under a British officer and it would be advisable if a second accompanied it. You must be guided by the local situation as to whether you stick to the main road or make any detour. Bands of Baharlu robbers are said to be infesting the road between Baft and Daulatabad. All military precautions must be strictly observed. The prisoners should be warned that they will be shot if they attempt to escape or their rescue is inevitable. 2. After starting the prisoners off for Bunder Abbas the remainder of the reinforcements should push on to Kerman without delay. (4) Memorandum dated Kerman, the 22nd August 1916. From— Major G. L. Farran, Commanding, South Persia Rifles, Kerman, To—The Officers Commanding Columns, Bunder Abbas-Kerman Road. I enclose a copy of instructions sent to you on 20 th August in case they did not reach you. Since sending them off I have received the attached telegram through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul here. I am doubtful if this can reach you in time to be of any good, but if it should, leading columns should halt at Daulatabad until third column joins up. The whole should then move together to Baft with all military precau tions. You must in any case use your own discretion as it is impossible to give you definite orders from here, owing to uncertainty of information and the time it takes to communicate with you. The prisoners should not be brought back to Kerman unless you find it the only possible safe course. Telegram No. 121, dated (and received) the 21st August 1916. From—Mr. Howson, Bunder Abbas, To —Major Lorimer, Kerman. (Repeated Cox, Basrah, Trevor, Bushire.) Wither’s informer reports that on the 18th, 250 Baharlu mostly sowars were seen going from Siahu and Tangi-i-Zagh. Their intention being to attackconvoy with reinforcements which left, Bunder Abbas on 7th between Daula- tabad and Baft or between Ahmedi and Daulatabad and to loot the Bank specie 51,000 tomans which is with it. I repeated your No. 46, dated the 19th of August to Wagstaff who left Bunder Abbas with two other British officers on the 20th. He replied that he thought that reinforcements should be stopped as nearly as possible to Daulatabad. It seems now all the more necessary to halt reinforcements till Wagstaff reaches them, so will you kindly send out special messenger to Eraser. I am also sending out to him from here. Re inforcements have large consignment of arms and ammunition with them. Addressed Lorimer; repeated Cox, Trevor. Copy forwarded with compliments to Major Farran, Commanding, South Persia Military Police. We could talk about this if you could look me up. 21st August 1916. D. LORIMER. Note. —I consider that this telegram should have been sent di-ect to Officer Commanding, South Persia Military Police, Kerman, and not to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul. There appears to me a tendency on the part of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul to usurp the duties of the South Persian Military Police. I do not complain particularly of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, who is good enough to forward •opies oi such telegrams to me. . (5) Memorandum, dated Kerman, the 27th Augnst 1916. From— Major G. L. Farran, Commanding, South Persia Rifles, Kerman, To—The Officer Commanding Columns, Bunder Abbas-Kerman Road. The following received from Captain Merrill, dated the 23rd August. “ Few minutes after my arrival (Sirjan) prisoners all fled with Shazada Hussain and Hussain Khan, Bochagchi, with 50 mixed horse and foot. Now at Kals- shang 3 farsaks east here, probably being Balvard 8 farsaks east here. Doctor and sick men remained here.” It appears that Shazjja Hussain has played us false. Captain Merrill has no doubt communicated with you already and he is making every effort to recapture the prisoners. A reward of tomans 500 a head is being offered for the prisoners, dead or alive. 1 cannot direct your movements definitely from here as the situation probably have altered before this can reach you. You should as seems best without taking undue risks. The convoy of arms and specie should be your first care, and the leading columns should not come beyond Baft until the third column arrives there and Captain Wagstaff takes command of the situ ation. It is probable that the columns may be required to go to Sirjan. Do what you can to urge the local people to take a hand in catching the prisoners and preventing supplies getting them. I have laid out despatch riders from Baft to Kermau (intermediate post&amp; being Negar and Kali Asghar). Please use them to send in any news. ( 6 ) {To be read and passed on by any British officer.} Dated Kerman, the 28th August 1916. From— Major G. L. Farran, Commanding, Kerman District, South Persia Rifles, To— Captain Wagstaff, 2nd Rajput Infantry. The situation as regards the prisoners is at present as follows :— Merrill from Sirjan reports that the escaped prisoners are at Balvard eight farsacks east of Sirjan. They are with a Buchagchi Chief one Hussain Khan and are said to be trying to raise the tribes against us.Merrill is at Sirjan trying to raise levies there. Sirjan is a most import ant centre and Merrill reports is now a hot bed of intrigue against us. I consider it advisable that a force should go to Sirjan. The situation will probably have changed by the time this letter reaches you, so it is impossible for me to give you definite orders. On your arrival at Baft you must be guided by your own judgment and reports you receive from Merrill and other sources, boih of which should be judged from a broad point of view. -• ^ ou f ? are . should he the convoy of arms, specie, etc., this might he parked at Baft m the fort or some other suitable position. At least 100 rifles sdould be told off to guard it and arrangements madeffor their supplies, fin tins I might assist you from here.) v You should move the remainder of your force, including the mountain gun, to Sirjan, unless from reports you have received you consider that this is running undue risk. I can give you no support from here. On arrival Sirjan you will take command there and act as the situation demanos. Captain Merrill and any levies he may have raised will be under your orders. Please report all movements to me here as quickly as possible. (7) (Received Kerman, August SOlh.) Dated Baft, the 26th August 1916. From Lieutenant A. D. Fraseb, Officer Commanding 1st Column (Reinforce ments and Convoy), To— Major G. L. Farran, Commanding, South Persia Rifles, Kerman. I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 22 nd instant, addressed to Officers Commanding Columns marching from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and to report the safe arrival of the convoy at Baft this morning, with the excep tion, I regret to say, of seven boxes of *303 small arms ammunition and some few stores of rations. These were washed away in a flood which caught us at the mouth of the Tangi-Zandan at Budkaneh-i-Shur. We were followed up for three or four days by Baharlu tribesmen about the neighbourhood of Bidue or Baulatabad to Xsmailabad. They did not attack us however. Their strength was estimated at about 200. At Bidu I received from Captain Buck, Commanding, South Persia Military Police at Bunder Abbas, copy of orders from Chief of the General Staff in which I was ordered to half my column at Baft until joined by Cap tain Wagstaff. But when leaving Kushku last night, 25th, I received a letter from Captain Merrill, dated August 23rd at Sirjan, informing me of the escape of the prisoners there. I then decided that it would be more expedient to move on to Kerman without delay for the following reasons, which I hope will meet with your approval. 1. In consequence of the escape of the German and Austrian prisoners I consider a closer proximity to Kerman as necessary to the greater security of the convoy. 2. Owing to the floods already mentioned a number of the bundles of rifles and boxes of ammunition got wet and should be thoroughly cleaned as soon as possible. 3. Locusts having d evastated the Baft district makes supplies for trans port animals and horses difficult, and necessitates the camels and donkeys grazing at some distance away (about 3 farsaks). This would make it impossi ble for me to adequately protect them if an attempt to loot them took place, and would so immobilise the convoy, and would also make it impossible to start hurriedly if required. Should you however wish my force to remain at Baft I could quickly return there and meet Captain Wagstaff’s Column leaving a small escort for the convoy onwards to Kerman, as it would then be a much safer zone.I 11 : f f hlfifLIj ,!n|H' in ■'A il f! m ; t m i ■ Dated Sirjan, the 25th August 1916.

The escaped prisoners are at Balvard 8 farsaks east from here jn house of one Hussain Khan Bochagchi tribe, where they will remain to gatner a force. I believe my information is accurate. ^ ^ ^ ^ Military precautions on the way. Your arrival here will safeguard me door- way of the great province of Bars, close the raid to raiders from that side, and keep this district from revolt. If need be you can proceed from here to Kerman. By coming to Sirjan you will not have a much longer journey to make than if you went direct to Kerman. Prompt action on your part is imperative.

From— Major G. L. Farran, Commanding, South Persia Rifles, Kerman, To— Captain L. C. Wagstaff. Since writing to you on the 28th I have received a letter from Eraser, dated Baft, 27th, saying that he had arrived with reinforcements and convoy at Baft, and was leaving for Negar. He does not mention Smith with the 108th (40 men) who I presume is still at Daulatabad. If you find him there I would suggest that vou both move up to Baft and from thence to Snqan as was originally intended, as you will not now be hampered by the convoy. But you must of course be guided by reports you receive and the situation at the time. a . . i 1 he prisoners are reported to be still at Balvard. Merrill is at birjan ana you should try and get into communication with him. (9) Dated Malikabad (near Sirjan), the 12th September 1917. From—Captain L. C. Wagstaff, To—The Officer Commanding, Kerman. Your letter of 7th September reached me yesterday and that of the 6 th September to day.r I regret to report that Hussain Khan and the prisoners, including the Turkish Ambassador, Brugman, two Afghans, an Arab and a servant, have escaped towards Darab, with 30 sowars, and some 40 tofangchis, and practically no baggage. The force under my command left Baft as you know on 7th September 1916, reached a Bagh near Bid Kurdu that evening and Mohame- dabad on the 8 th. This place is 3 farsakhs from Balvard. Ten sowars includ ing Abdul Hussain Khan of the Afsharis accompanied us frogi Soogo to Mohamedabad at my request. Nazar Khan (Afshari) and 6 sowars and 20 tofangchis were sent by Mutashuma-ud-Dowleh from Baft and stayed with us till the 10 th (morning). On the morning of the 9th we reconnoitred Balvard with glasses from a hill top, and roughly sketched the main points of the surrounding country, which is an open plain on this (Baft) side From Baft I had written to Merrill at Sirjan asking him to communicate with me and arrange a simultaneous move on Balvard from both sides, as soon as the troops from Kerman arrived. My intention was to remain on the Baft side of Balvard within striking distance, and reconnoitre until such a simultaneous move coaid be made. I was entirely without information at the time as regards time of arrival of Kerman troops and Merrill’s forces, though letters were on their way. On the 9th, I moved to Dehanu, a village where supplies were obtainable, and also 3 farsakhs from Balvard. There I heard that Hussain Khan had moved from Balvard on night of 8th-9th, to Khushrui with all his men, their families and possessions, had in fact ? ? ? Balvard completely, I sent men out at once to prove these facts, and was unwilling to open the Hushun road, until I made sure he was making south or elsewhere by the Tnrun road, via, Malika- bad. I expected him to move slowly with the enormous baggage train he had with him. My informer reached me at 7 a.m., 10 th September 1910, with the information that Hussain Khan was at Khushrui up to midnight 9th-10th. At 7-20 a.m., I started from Malikabad and reached there at 12-45 p.m , only to hear that Hussain Khan had left at sunset on the 9 th for a place in the hills (it wns variously stated) one of roads through the hills for Ears, with about 80 sowars and tufangchis and 60 camels loaded with food for men and animals. I received here several letters from Merrill who said he expected the Cavalry (30) from Kerman at sunset 10th September, and the infantry next day. I had written to him immediately on reaching Malikabad hearing that Hussain Khan had fled to send a large force of cavalry, including the regular cavalry, at once by another road from Saidabad to try and cut off the enemy. At the same time he wrote to say that he was doing this, and would join me here with the infantry. That evening 45 sowars and 50 tufangchis under Aziz Khan and Abbas Khan reached me. On the morning of the 11 th, a letter was intercepted, which seemed to show that Hussain Khan was at Bagh Khajhooi, a place about 15 miles from here on his road. I started from this place at 2-30 p.m , with the two Khan’s levies after the greatest trouble with the jeloudars (owners of my transport) and leaving orders for the Kerman troops to follow at once. Merrill hoped to get them to Malikabad by 6 p.m., 11 th September 1910. On the way to Khajhooi we picked up 8 deserters from Hussain Khan, who fired a few shots from right. The said Hussain Khan left Chashmeh Safid 13 faraskhs away at sunset 10th. We bivouacked at Aval Cbagouli within sight of Bagh Khajooi that night. At sunset Agha Murad Khan with some sowars arrived and a few shots were exchanged by our men and their sowars before the mistake was found out. It was practically dark. Agha Murad Khan had left (?) after some delay at 1-0 a.m., 11th September 1916. with Lieutenant Eraser to try and cut off Hussain Khan. Lieutenant Eraser reports that Murad Khan went very slowly and unwillingly, but he, Eraser, pushed on, and reached Zavaroo well, 13 farsakhs from Saidabad, at noon 11th September 1916 to find that Hussain Khan’s party had passed by an adjacent path in the early hours of that morning. His horses were done, and he had no rations for men or horses except a little grain on the horses, and turned back. On his way back he lost his way, and turned up next morning at Malikabad. Murad Khan, who did not go so 1111 ; J 1 b) 'i 128 far, returned by our road, and reported Hussain Khan (his cousin) was far out of our reach, and near Darab by that time. This confirmed previous reports, and I have returned to Malikabad, will move to Saidabad to-morrow, and await your orders. I think a perusal of above will show that all my movements were known ^ to the hour, and that I was hampered hopelessly by the lack of the regular cavalry. All officers in charge of various parties report what I experienced everywhere, that every body of importance tried to delay our movements by producing supplies and other such means (not actively but passively), and that our movements were immediately reported to the enemy. In fact every body’s hand has been against us in this affair, and I think it would he same in any country. It seems too much to expect any Persian to help in the capture of a Khan they have had daily relations with for years. Above all I want to give my opinion that if I had had the cavalry and infantry of the Column under Lieutenant Fraser from Baft as originally planned, that things would have been very different, my force being only infantry could move only very slowly, and no help at all was given from fcaidabad (Sirjan) while the enemy was still at Balvard. In fact till I reached Malikabad 1 farsakh from Khushrui I was in ignorance of the strength of our other forces, though I had heard through the Governor of Baft that the Kerman troops were starting (no date was given). JNow I await your orders. I am quite prepared to take my force less a few sick along the Fars road, but to do so they must be more mobile. I would ask permission if ordered to push on, to be allowed to buy or hire or borrow as many horses as I can find regular men for, who can ride. This would make with the cavalry a quite moving force, and the rest of the infantry would provide an escort for a caravan of supplies, which could move as required. I think I could then mistify the enemy, though some risk would be run of being caught separately. It is in my opinion quite useless to rely on tribal levies in this matter. Khans move most reluctantly and their sowars will not go forward where there is any danger. An arrangement such as I suggest above, of mounted infantry with supplies within reach, would be necessary if a column is required to move from here in co-operation with any other columns, e g., from General Sykes. But you will know before this reaches you, whether a column ip necessary from here. I feel it is use 1 ess to advance into Baharlu country without some assistance from regulars and have no faith in the assistance of any forces we could get from here. Merrill reports that the forces he had raised here are really useless. They cannot be even turned out for parade at any given time, they have no discip line and cannot be taught any because they are not kept in one camp or barrack. They will not go into a fight or where there is any danger and will not fight against (or take action against) any of the local people. He ordered 10 tufangchis out last night and only 20 turned out. He ordered luO sowars to go with Lieutenant Fraser, and only about 10 went out with him, another 40 turning up in small groups by the morning. Such men seem useless and their pay a waste of money, and I would like to suggest that the best only, if willing, be enlisted in the regular South Persia Bifles and the rest disbanded now that there is a force here. If possible men enlisted in the South Persia Bifles should be employed away from their own country judging from local experience. The men enlisted here though their number may impress the surrounding peasants are more in the hands of local Persian authorities than their officers. It would be different with regular South Persia Bifles out of their own district. I want written permission to destroy Hussain Khan fort in Balvard and Khushrui fort which harboured him, I think this would be good lesson, but is a political question and ultra vires for me. A fight of sorts is reported or rather rumoured from Darab. This may mean that the Baharlus are or have tried to capture Hussain Khan and prison ers. No confirmation is available.Our prisoners stated Hussain Khan meant to go to Sheikh Abdul Hussain and try to get forces from, him and to return here. Failing that he would make for Shiraz where the Germans said a force would assist them under two Germans. Personally 1 think they will make for Kerraanshah and Turkish forces and that Bushire and Ahwaz should be warned accordingly. Will you please wire to Chief of the General Staff, Simla, to report above escape of prisoners, stating that it was the unavoidable delay in arrival and despatch of the mounted troops, and the lack of information and difficultv of inter-communication which enabled them to get through. Chief of the General Staff is very insistent that information should be supplied re prisoners. ( 10 ) {South Persia Rijles, Kerman District.) Memorandum No. 237, dated Kerman, the 17th September 1916. Prom— Major G. L. Par ran, Commanding, South Persia Rifles, To— Cappain L. C. Wag staff, South Persia Rifles, Sirjan. Tour report dated 12 th September received also Fraser’s report of same date. I think you did all possible but the circumstances you mention were too greatly in favour of the prisoners. We can do nothing from this side now except try and prevent them should they attempt to double back. I consider pursuit into Fars with a force as weak as yours would be unduly dangerous and probably useless undertaking. In this the Consul here concurs. You had therefore better remain in Sirjan. I do not dispair of the prisoners being finally recovered. The Qawam professes friendship and had just offered to hand over the Germans he already holds. Hussain Khan, away from his own country and a fugitive, is not likely to meet with a very warm reception in Fars. Shiraz, Ispahan and Bushire have all been informed and I do not think the prisoners will be able to get through to Turkish forces. There is some danger of the Turk doubling and trying for Afghanistan, as he has always wanted to go there. Sistan have been warned. You should try and keep a spy on the future movements of Hussain Khan and the prisoners. In the meantime destroy Hussain Khan’s fort at Balvard as you suggest and also Khusjrui fort. There is as matter of fact no objection on political grounds as the Consul here agrees, but in any case we ha ve orders to hunt down German Agents and restore law and order, and the destroying of these forts comes well within our powers. In order to leave you free should you have to move rapidly in any direc tion I think it would be well if you sent the doctor and the two sick prisoners in here. Ton might send any of your own sick. They would have to come under a guard of course. I could replace some of the sick with fit men of the 124th from here and a guard would be very useful to escort a convoy out to you should you require supplies, money or anything. Merrill who left here at very short notice and without baggage might like to come in at any rate for a few days. We badly want a South Persia Kifles Infantry Officer here. I think you might send in Merrill, Carr or one other. By all means buy the horses and mules you can and teach the Infantry to ride them so that they can move rapidly if necessary. We can get no horses here and would be glad to have some bought. These gunners from Bunder Abbas want a lot of training, so keep them at it or they will be useless when wanted. I am trying to train another lot here. As regards the levies and your remarks on the employment of local people generally. I quite agree with all you say. It is difficult however at present to get men from other districts. The north being the Brnssian sphere cannot be tapped and Fars and the more western are hardly likely to join just now orleave their own districts. In any case it is difficult to get Persians to serve far from their homes for long. I hope later we may he able to improve I a°Tee with you that the Levies now at Sirjan are probably not worth their pay. On the other hand I would not advise their being all dismisse at once. Every man in our service however half-hearted is a. man lost to me o^her side and if we cast them all they may become active against us. Cer tainly enlist the best into the South Persia Rifles if you can get them to 30 m You might with advantage send them in here. The rest you should get rid of gradually. Y'ou could turn away at onpe those who absolutely failed when called upon and others by degrees. I think it would be well to try and keep some sort of hold over them in case Hussain Khan and the prisoners come back in this direction and get them over to their service. I would any Officer coming in to report on the Sirjan-Kerman road with a view to its being fit for motor traffic. I would also like to know something of the road Baft-Sirjan in the same connection. We are expecting cars here shortly from the Sistan side. (H) Keport No. 18, dated the 30th September 1916. Prom— Captain L. C. Wagstaef, Saidabad, To—The Officer Commanding, Kerman. 1 I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your demi-official, dated the 19th September 1916, and No. 275 of 23rd September, with enclosures, but no further communications have since been received. 2 . On the evening of the 27th instant I received information from the Kalanter of Doragah that Hussain Khan and party had arrived at Kaleh Ghairbi, and as this was on the road to Horagah, and agreed with information received by me which pointed to his leaving Kuhistan for that direction. I issued orders for the Column to move thither at daybreak 28th instant as there seemed a very good chance of capturing the whole of our enemy s party. 3. At 2 a.m. night 27th-28th September I received a report that Hussain Khan was nearing Saidabad. I did not believe it, but sent out a strong patrol under British officers to find out what they could. Other information came in which proved he had actually entered Saidabad during the night. Mean while I had moved out all my force from the gardens we occupy, except a guard for the prisoners, and surrounded the town, the Infantry holding _ the north and west sides, and the mounted men the open east and south sides. The Infantry advanced to the attack and reached by midday the positions shown in the attached sketch. Practically all the towers_ and walls of the city were held against us, and there must have been £00 rifles firing on us. The towers of the Adl-es-Sultan and Rashid-es-Sultan were not occupied by the enemy. Our guns fired on the towers held by the enemy, but did not have any great effect owing to their small size, and not being very well served. Captain Merrill’s brass gun has no sights and only a few shells exploded. I did not feel justified in incurring the certain loss of life in rushing the town in day light, and waited for night though I got the mountain gun to within 250 yards of the town at sunset, and used its last 6 rounds at point blank range. Just after sunset about 20 horsemen made a dash out of the town, and chaching our cavalry out of the way, got clear away, although we fired very rapid infantry fire at them. During the night we moved nearer the walls, within 149 yards of them, to be within range for our rifle grenades and meaning to rush in at dawn. But when we went forward we found the town undefended. We now occupy most of the towers held by the enemy. 4. It is my belief that Hussain Khan with only some 20 or 30 horsemen was let into the town and given towers and help by the townspeople. With out their help he could not have taken a single tower. No one except these 20 horsemen escaped from the town during the night 28th-29th. The presen »whereabouts of Hussain Khan are unknown, but it is said he has gone to Balvard. Enquiries are being made. He is unlikely to leave there for some time unless we move. But I propose to move against him to-morrow if he is there. Bruggman, Lorentz the Sarhang and Schahzad Hussain are said to ^ have been with him. The Safir and Aghans are said to have not been here. A My mounted men have been patrolling from dawn 28th to dawn 29th and all day yesterday to prevent any enemy tufangchis getting away. All the rifle men who helped the enemy are still hiding in the town, and owners of towers held by the enemy have all fled, and I find it absolutely impossible to find the culprits or disarm the men who fought against us because nobody will help us and we cannot recognise them. They have buried their arms. 5. As none of us have any doubt that the very large majority of the men firing on us, were provided by the townspeople, and it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack to find these men, I am informing the Adl-es-Sultan that the town must pay a fine of Ts. 15,000, which I will take in horses, supplies or cash. For this I request that sanction may be granted. If this is nut considered advisable it can be returned. 6 . I have no ammunition for the Mountain Gun except 4 case shot and 4 star shell, and I would request that at least 200 rounds for this gun be sent to me at once. The fight we were engaged in lasted all day and we had only 50 rounds with us. Really this gun is not big enough to break down towers without a large expenditure of ammunition and I would suggest that either a bigger gun be sent here or motors or another mountain gun be sent here with at least 200 rounds per gun. I am told that either of these is available in Kerman. 7 . I attach a list of casualties we sustained, and beg that a town that helped an outlaw to this extent should be heavily punished. The Persians themselves have nothing to say when we accuse the town of helping Hussain Khan and the thing is obvious to us. i'he only outsiders here are a caravan of Laris who have 60 good rifles. They arrived a day before Hussain Khan and I consider the coincidence very suspicious. I myself had a bullet through my topee and I think that efforts should be made to get proper compensa tion out of the Persian Government for the killed and wounded. 8 . I am taking it upon myself to keep the whole of my force here until I get further orders. In view of the now proved fact that a large proportion of the local population is against us, and that Hussain Khan is again in the neighbourhood, or could at any rate reach here whenever he wishes to, ^ and the probability of having to defend a town of this size, and at the same time keep a striking force available to attack him if I can find out where he is. I hope that no reduction will be made in favour of other places. The force is absurdly small for the duties asked of it. 9 . I wish to add that I had arranged to put picquets all round the town on the evening of the 27 th in consequence of the rumours of the possibility of Hussain Khan’s coming, when I received from two sources news which seemed to make this impossible, and in consequence did not put out the picquets. I think it quite likely that the Safir, Obeidullah, and the Afghans have gone towards Afghanistan, but they must be half way there by now. The greatest difficulty here is to get any information, without any telegram or means of rapid transit, and with most people concerned in sending us astray or hiding information until it is too late. 10. Of Merrill’s irregular force only about 30 sowars and 60 tufangchis gave us any kind of help, and that only at a safe distance. 11. If we are not to leave Sirjan yet for Kerman please send us, in addi tion to the gun ammunition asked for:— 2 drums of rifle oil, 30 boxes of small arms ammunition ’303.Our watches are all damaged, if 2 or 3 are available we would take them and pay for them ourselves:— 12 blankets for the sick and wounded, some stores for officers. Whisky (2 cases), beer, jam, bacon if available, saddle soap, horse brushes and curry combs if possible. The doctor wants 2 bottles of brandy and 2 lanterns, 12. We have not yet bad any volunteers for the South Persia Eifles but I have not mentioned a capitation grant. 13. We have secured 22 horses and 14 mules at present and hope to get a lot more from this fine that we have ordered the town to pay. 14 Sbazadah Hussain has apparently tried to find out from Adl-es-Sultan if he would be pardoned if he gave himself up. No answer has been given as this occurred during the fighting. 15. Captain Merrill will go up to Kerman in a few days time when we have collected all possible evidence as to the culprits here. 16. We shall probably not want money here just yet if this fine is paid, though we shall want some lai er, as a great part of this fine may be in kind and the Moleyeh cannot produce much. 1 should be glad if you would send us some, say about 5,000 tomans in case of urgency. We cannot stay here with out money. . Copy to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, (11A) Casualty List. 28th September 1916. No. Regiment. Regiment No. Rank. Name. Nature injury.

The Column halted at Kerman for about six weeks during which period recruiting for the South Persia Rifles was opened and the affairs of the pro vince placed on a better footing. Punishments were inflicted on the disturbers of the peace and a few Ger man and Turkish prisoners were taken over from the Persian authorities.

A At Mehdiabad on 9th August and, two flays later, at Griidkuh, information v as received of the serious Turkish ad vance and of the possible evacuation of Tehran by the allied Legations and Colonies. In view of this unfavourable change in the situation I telegraphed to India for reinforcements. ^ I also made arrangements for an increased supply of rations at Yezd, as it seemed probable, at that time, that the Ispahan Colony would have to retire on that city. During this period Major Lorimer viewed the Baharlu raids so seriously that he recommended the despatch of a special column to deal M'ith them, 5. Upon arrival at Yezd on August 14th, I had conversations on the line with His Majesty’s Minister, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan and Colonel Gough. Brom these it appeared to me that with the I urks at Hamadan and threatening Sultanabad, the Bars question became of secondary importance, whereas it was most desirable to strengthen the weak Russian Borce at Ispahan, which was threatened with an attack by the Bakhtians, supported by German and Turkish officers with artillery The Russian Commandant and His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, took this view. The question of supplies caused deep anxiety as, owing to locusts and the insecurity of the roads, Yezd resembled a besieged city and the wants ch the Column were supplied vith difficulty. Supplies had, indeed, been lam out towards Dehbid from Yezd. Bor the section between Dehbid and bhiraz, the supply caravans had left Ispahan but were held up at Abadeh by robbers. There was thus no means of proceeding to Shiraz via Dehbid at that time without running the risk of having no supplies. ^ Bor the route to Ispahan, thanks to the Telegraph officials, supplies were available, and when the Govern ment of India strongly urged the movements of the Column to Ispahan, I made arrangements 'for the supplies to be laid out. 6 While halting at Yezd, 350 mules which bad been purchased in the neighbourhood of Ispahan for the South Persia Rifles, were despatched under escort of 15 som 7 ars of the Ispahan Consulate under Ressaidar Malik KaD Nawaz and 20 Russian Cossacks under Lieutenant Kolominski Near Kuhpa an attack was made on the party which was repelled mainly by the Russian Cossacks, who defeated and pursued a superior force of mounted robbers. Bor his gallant behaviour Lieutenant Kolominski M r as awarcied the British Military Cross, The Cossacks returned to Ispahan from Kuhpa and their place M r as taken by some gendarmes of the Tth (Yezd) regiment. A second attack was made on the party north of Agda and the robbers who were in force surrounded that village. Information reached Y r ezd at night by a telephone message from Ardakan and Major Bruce, starting off shortly alter midnight, marched 62 miles before dark in considerable heat. Upon approaching Akda he found that the robbers had fled and he subsequently leisurely marched back to Ardakan where he effected a junction with Captain Chaldecott, who Mas in command of a company of i 2 dtn Baluchis, which had been sent in support. I consider that Major Bruce &amp; march M 7 as a fine performance, carried out as it was without a single case o. lasqeness or s reback. 1 I 1^ ^ n ^ er incident of a different nature also occurred at this time, the lelegraph Office of Ardestan being besieged by Cbiragb Ali Khan, Sirdar Solat, the bead of some 300 brigands. Fortunately this robber leader left for Ispahan to take part m the attack on that city referred to above. He was however fumself attacked and his band almost annihilated by the Russian Cossacks. 1 understand that he is now a local G-overnor under the Zill-us-Sultan, 8 . Yet another point to notice was that heavy drafts were made by ^e ran on the /ezd Bank and as money was extremely scarce in the bazaar, I commandeered the small amount of specie temporarily to prevent our beim? left entirely without funds. Yezd was left on August 28th the Column marching over a very and country to Ardakan where the heat was trying. Supplies, as usual, were our chief occupation. Owing to the swarms of robbers the Nain Telegraph Clerk did not dare to despatch forage for the desert stages of Chah JNo and No Gumbaz until our approach and, at his request the cavalry marched to No Gumbaz to seize its caravanserai with supporting infantry under Captain Macmahon at Chah No. By this means the safety of the supplies was assured. * J 10 . We had scarcely reached Chah No, a short stage of 10 miles, when a telegram was received from His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, requesting me to accelerate the march of the Column in view of the very serious position at Ispahan, wheie a combined attack by Bakhtiaris with European officers and robber bands was feared. In response the Column set off again in the evening and marching through the night, reached Bambiz Mian after a total march from Akda of 38 miles in 26 hours without a man falling out. The Column continued its inarch, without halts, receiving another request to hasten from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Kuhpa and reached Ispahan on September 11 th without further incident. 11 . Colonel Gough and the Farman Farma (who P) had left Ispahan on August 24th, at Dehbid about two-thirds of the way to Shiraz, were confronted with a successful coup made by the Solat-a-Dola, the Kawam-ul-Mulk and others who had seized the Farman Farma’s deputy and petitioned the Persian Government against the Farman Farma. Colonel Gough pressed for the Column to be despatched immediately but this was out of the question at the time. The Farman Farma and Colonel Gough, after remaining at Dehbid for a few days, retreated to Abadeh where matters were finally arranged ; a second forward movement was then made to Shiraz, which was reached without further incident on October 18th. 12 . The column was at first busily occupied with refitting at Ispahan. During its stay a strong detachment was sent to Kumishah with Ts. 30,000 for Colonel Gough. It took over the German prisoner Paschen and two Persian gen darme officers who had been hostile to the British. A second force, including almost the whole of the Column proceeded to Kavarukh and escorted in some thousands of loads of British merchandize. This was not accomplished with out a skirmish with Jafar Kuli Khan, a leading brigand as previously reported. During the five weeks spent at Ispahan, the military situation tended to become stereotyped. Weak attacks by levies in Turkish pay were made on Sultanabad and elsewhere but there was no fear of the Turks advancing on Kazvin or Tehran ; they had evidently reached the limit of their advance. The Bakhtiaris, too, who had been severely handled by the Russians a few days before the arrival of the Column, were distinctly less bellicose. Under these improved circumstances it was decided that the Column should proceed to Shiraz. 13. The only incident worthy of record was the recapture of some robber? belonging to the Nafar tribe at Kuru, a village to the W. N. W. of Maqsud Beg At Aminabad we entered Pars and were met by Salar Munazzam, who commands the South Persia Rifles force, which has its head quarters at Abadeh. We immediately began to re-organize these troops nearDehbid. Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter with the cavalry left the Column to follow the wagon route which runs to the east of the caravan route and is slightly longer. This he successfully examined and surveyed rejoining the Column near Kawamabad. Between Kinara and Zerghun I examined the famous Band-i-Amir and was much impressed by its potentialities, the discharge of water being considerable for Persia. Finally on November 2th the Column reached Shiraz and hereby completed a march of one thousand miles. 14. In conclusion it is worth noting that, imspite of scarcity due to locusts and robbers, the arrangements for supplies worked out remarkably well. For this we had mainly to thank the officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The water difficulty was also less serious than I had anticipated. The terrain was ideal for a small force of regular troops, consisting mainly of treeless valleys 10 miles wide, even the very few passes being relatively easy. As the Column was in one sense an escort to its own base, wffiich accompanied it, these advantages were extremely valu able. The terrain in Fars was hilly and difficult in places, but the well- armed nomads, who might have given trouble, had left the “ cold country ” for their winter haunts Consequently the long march across Southern Persia was accomplished without a shot being fired except at Kavarukk and Kuru. 15. I have much pleasure in reporting that the relations between the Column and the inhabitants were excellent. Everywhere the excellent disci pline and the good behaviour of the troops was most favourably commented on, their habit of paying for everything contrasting most favourably with the behaviour of theCossa'ks. The successful march of the Column reflects great credit on all ranks and especially on Lieutenant-Colonel E. F. Twigg, Major S. M. Bruce and Major B. S. Rothwell, the Commanding Officers, on Lieute nant Colonel F. F. Hunter and Captain B. Gr. Hinde, the Staff Officers, and on Major De Yere Condon, I.M.S., Conductor W. Hayes and Staff Sergeant H. Catto also deserve mention for good service in the field in connection with Supplies and Transport. 16.

Demi-official letter dated the 7th December 1916. From—Lieutenant-Colonel R. L. Kennion, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. I am writing a line in amplification of my telegram on the subject of your proposed visit to Chaman-i-Sultan. The situation here is briefly as under Amir Mafakham is openly hostile. He has with him only a few sowars at Araq, but his two sons S. Miazam and Yarulla Khan and his sowars have been with the rebels and taking part in the attacks on Sultanabad. Together with Sallar Masud, Abdul Kasim Khan, Bahadur-u-Saltaneh and Sikandar Khan, they have a considerable following, the exact whereabouts of which is not accurately known from day to day. Hojabr-u-Sultaneh is with us and so is S. Muktadir, his cousin, and also Khuja Baqir Khan and other minor Chehar Lang Kharis, But Khuja’s cousin, Sardar Muzaffar, is hostile and he has taken sowars to join Muzkar- u-Dowleh, who is on the Chehar Lang border. He was reported tie other day to have crossed it. The mixed rebel force of Lurs and Gendarmes with a number of Bakhtiari, the whole estimated at between 1,000 and 2 , 000 , are now divided up amongst the Araq villages of Azha Kazzar and that neighbourhood as far as Bozane, i.e., within 12 to 16 miles of Sultanabad, thus practically cutting—or threatening— communications between this place and the Chehar Lang country. As reported by telegram A. Mufakham recently seized Khajah’s brother, the Shahal-i-Lashkar and is keeping him a prisoner in Araq. Khujah, therefore, besides being as it were between three fires, has his brother a hostage with the enemy. He is scarcely therefore in a position to provide a sufficiently strong escort without Russian support. The whole situation would be cleared at once if the Russians would go out and disperse the rebel gathering, but they have remained on the defensive, practically shut up in Sultanabad since about the 26th October, with the rebel force pillaging all round and attacking the town whenever they felt inclined. Their only effort has been the night raid of the 27th November, which was successful so far as it went, but not really effective as the Russian troops incontinently hurried back to Sultanabad with their booty, instead of following the rebels up. They have plenty of troops here now to be able to go out and completely clear Araq and scatter the rebels, and this once done it is improbable at this season that they would collect again. I have repeatedly urged this course on Bicharahoff. but on one ground or another a reported reinforcement at Daulatabad, or a Turkish advance on Saruk, or want of precise information he has always pleaded inability. Yesterday I again spoke to him on the subject, with special reference to your tour and he said he did not want to risk anything and must wait further reinforcements. He said it was not practicable for you to go to Chaman-i-Sultan via Sultanabad at present and until the rebel force in Araq is disposed of, I think myself that in existing circumstances it would hardly be feasible Of course, if the Russians would send two or three squadrons with a gun to escort you, which is all the force necessary to deal with the rebels, Khojah would join you with his sowars and the tour would have a most excellent effect. But the detachment of a movable column of this sort is the step which Bicharahoff fears to take without farther reinforcements. It is this lack of enterprise-combined with the Russian’s extreme un popularity—that is making the task I was sent to carry out so difficult. The Russians have been on the retreat and defensive ever since I have been here (for part of the time necessarily so, as they had insufficient ^ troops) and in such circumstances one cannot expect local Khans to come in with their sowars to relieve the situation. The most that can be hoped for is to induce a proportion of them to stand aloof from the popular movement and this has been done. Certain important sections of the Lurs, the Chehar Lang Khans and Sardar Hashmat have all to a greater or lesser extent opposed the rebels passively and[ jfl. 38 are ready to come in directly tlie local initiative passes to tlm Russians^ E^en this would hardly have been possible if it were not for animosities and rivalries _ I understand that Bicharahoff has troops on the way here now to rein force him, so that I think that the present unsatisfactory situation is certain to come to an end soon. As I am writing on the subject of the general situation here, Moir asks me to add that he has several times been asked lately if the outlook is not sufficiently satisfactory for the Bank to reopen here, and the British commu nity to rfturn. With the rebel force within a few miles of the town and the Bussian Commandant taking the view that he is not strong enough to take the offensive, Moir is naturally unwilling to take the responsibility of advising the Bank to reopen, with all that that would mean, and others to undertake the expense of bringing back all their gear and belongings, and I think he is quite right.

(Addressed Tehran ; repeated Shiraz and Basrah.) and Political Shiraz telegram 45-F. In my opinion suppression of rebels on Bushire- Shiraz road requires the permanent removal of the Khans of Kazerun, Eonar- takhteh, Daliki and Borasjun. Unless this is done I do not think any lasting settlement can be effected. In present conditions there is no doubt that best way to carry this out is by employment of our own forces arid by co^ bined British and Persian operations from Bushire and Shiraz. The hostiL Khans themselves anticipate this and reports daily received m Bushire sho that they are in great trepidation, and that idea of resistance is evaporating. Perhaps, however, it may have been decided not to engage in any operations in this neighbourhood unless absolutely necessary. If this is the case, it may he advisable to see what Soulet can do, as I agree with Colonel Gong that it may he dangerous to do nothing, and that^ employment of tnbesm from Behbehan neighbourhood is undesirable even if feasible. As regards Soulet judging from previous experience it appears to me verv unlikely that he will take drastic measures against hostile hJians ii left to himself. He is much more likely to get Nasn Hiwan to evacuate Kazerun by diplomatic means and stipulate for retention of other Hostile Khans further down road. Besides this the Kashgais will have begun their migration and passed above Kazerun by April I 5 th, and experience shows that after that date will he impossible for Soulet to maintain a force on road and even to renl south himself after that date. Any arrangements with hostile Khans in volving their retention in their positions -would be prejudicial to in t er o sts Persian Government and ours and even if owing to pressure from ^outet ine Khans themselves temporarily evacuated their towers, there won nothing to prevent their ictuming and re-occupying them when ilasii &amp; ais move. In these circumstances, before invoking assistance of Soulet it seems necessary to decide (1) what precise measures we require Soulet to ,at. and ( 2 ) in the event of his agreeing and taking such measures successluiiy.3 what arrangements we propose to make after he has taken action. In regard to these I beg to make following comments : ( 1 ) xt seems very doubtful if Soulet could undertake operations so far afield as Diliki and Borasjun, or would care to embroil him self to such an extent. ( 2 ) Would South Persia Rifles he in position to take over Kazerun and other posts on road from Soulet ? Daria Begi, with assistance of friendly Khans, could probably take over trom Daliki to Bushire but he would not be able to capture them in first instance without British assistance as he has not the force or guns. 147 Telegram P., No. 56-F., dated the 12th (received 13th) February 1917.

(Repeated Tehran, Baluchistan, Meshed, Bushire, Kerman, and General Officer Commanding, Saindak.) My telegram of 8 th February, 55-P ; I recommend that Syed Mustafa be sent to India. According to Abbas Ali Shirazi retired dragoman and our Karguzar he does not speak Persian like a native and speaks Turkish better, and I think he must be Turkish secret agent if he is not criminal absconder from Peshawar. He had portfolio of papers which he calls charms but which may contain cypher. Syed admits having lived 7 years in Egypt. His mother was of Shiraz and his father Najaf. Syed became bankrupt in Bombay and his goods were sold by decree of Small Cause Court.

European and other prisoners having been taken over by Sykes there remains the question of disposal of 12 Afghan prisoners. (See my telegram No. 62-B., October'30th last) I could arrange with Earman Earma to send them under guard to Kawam at Lar who could forward them in safety to Lingah. It has been decided by SyRes and self that it will be best not to send Turkish prisoners to Ispahan. They proved somewhat unruly when being taken over and their presence would add enormously to difficulty of escort on road. I could arrange to send them to Lingah in same way as suggested above for Afghans. They would of course not go in same party as latter but be sent when the others had arrived safely at Lingah. Please telegraph if this course is approved.Telegram R.j No. 54-F., dated the 13th (received 14th) February 1917.

European prisoners taken over yesterday and will march to Ispahan in 2 or 3 days. No excitement caused. Reinforcement of 100 men for Sykes’ Column arrived to-day. Hostile forces returned to Kazerun and South Persia Rifles occupy one or two posts west of Khane Zinian. No further news of Soulet. Mahomet Khan Kashkuli is said to be posing as master of the situation but has not shown his hand by overt acts. His movements probably depend on Soulet’s instructions. As Soulet’s man he could crush tribes if he wanted. Kawam has sent in 22 prisoners Arabs. He does not intend to attack Baharlus till their crops are ripening when they become more vulnerable. Seven hundred camel loads of grain have come from Eiruzabad and prices have dropped considerably. About 15 or 20 deaths from starvation occurred daily notwithstanding low prices and establishment of poor house where about 400 persons are fed. Starving persons come into town from surrounding country. Everything quiet in town and on all roads but that to Bushire.

If Government agree to send a sufficient force to deal with situation and occupy Borasjun we could co-operate from here and this would be far most satisfactory solution. My reports agree with Trevor that Khans are very nervous and resistance will now he slight. But mere demonstration from Bushire would be useless. Borasjun would have to be held for year or two and hostile Khans permanently disposed of. If not, then we must do what we can by diplomacy through Soulet or any other way possible. This would be costly and as Trevor points out not by any means permanent or satisfactory settlement of situation. May I be informed if the Government contemplate taking any action from Bushire.

Persian Situation. The soil of our sacred country has not been released from the pressure of the tyranny and oppression of the enemies, that is, Russia and England. In the north fighting is going on over an extensive front hut news from there for the south is suppressed. In the south, although, praise be to God, the British have not made an advance on account of their weakness, they are constantly trying to increase their force It is now nine months since they obtained domination over Shiraz and laid plans for the extension of their influence, but, praise be to God, they have not even been able to secure complete control over Shiraz itself. They have not even secured a safe position ,for themselves. They are constantly sending men from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, Yezd, Ispahan and Shiraz. Notwithstanding the fact that there is no way by which the people in the south can receive help and assistance, they are setting up a stubborn resistance against them and have cleared Sirian, Abadeh and Kazerun from the dirty stain of their existence. ^ Sardar Ashair having reviewed the actions of the English during this period has become fully aware tiiat their real object is the destruction of Persia and the last shred of her independence ; he has turned his attention to the unfortunate people and entered the door of opposition to them (the English). The allied khans of the south, who have guarded their districts, will resolutely prevent the arrival of the forces of the enemy. Shiraz. A letter dated 25th Safar from Shiraz says :— “ The German-Turkish troops have besieged Tehran. As the telegraph line has been interrupted for the last few days, the British themselves have no news of the above. “ After the news of the Kazerun affairs became widely known, the British Consul summoned Qawam-ul-Mulk and Mirza Mustafa Khan and called upon them immediately to order the Arab and Baharlu tribesmen to retake Kazerun. His Excellency Qawam-ul-Mulk replied that the Arabs could not fight on that side {i.e., in the neighbourhood of Kazerun). The Consul became angry at this answer and ordered them to be detained. Qawam-ul-Mulk informed his family at once and 300 sowars gathered round the Consulate. The British did not think it advisable to detain him and set him free, but detained Mirza Mustafa Khan. Qawam-ul-Mulk returned to his house and has not come out for some days past. He insisted on the release of Mirza Mustafa Khan, and the British Consul himself took Mirza Mustafa Khan to Qawam-ul-Mulk’s house. i .1 I TuniA IKiJia r u Letter. Dated SREIGII No. 1 II 16 FEB 1 S 17 13 MAR 1917£C Qawam-ul-Mulk is not satisfied with this hut demands an indemnity for the insult. It appears that they are trying to obtain his satisfaction, and have already taken him with them on a shooting expedition and paid him some money. Shariq-us-Sultan and Seyed Abu Thalib Khan, who had refused to leave, have been imprisoned. Eath-ul-Mulk feigns sickness. There is extraordinary excitement in the town, and there is a run on the Bank. The British feel very uneasy. The local gendarmes are all anti-British. Yesterday about 200 of the Barman Barma’s gendarmes went in the direction of Dasht- Arjan. Soulet-ud-Douleh’s policy is hostile to them. Qawam’s attitude, although he received money from them two days ago, is also very hostile. Some wounded arrived to-day from Khaneh-Zenian, Some women are shouting out in the streets and bazaars that the English Bank has become bankrupt, and that the people should secure coin in exchange for their notes. There is great excitement. The Bank has paid so far, but has sent 50,000 (tomans ?) to Yezd and Kerman. Zia-ul-Waizin and Zia-ul-Udeba have been released from imprisonment. It is reported that about 100 loads of ammunition en route from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz have been robbed on the road by the Sar-i-Kuhi tribesmen.” Kazerun. Important documents have been intercepted at Kazerun including one from the Darya Begi and Ali Akbar Khan which will shortly be published for the information of the people. Measures have been taken to intercept the enemy’s special messengers. Muhammad Ali Khan Kashkuli, who until yesterday professed to be a Nationalist, appears now to have made submission to the Governor-General owing to his straitened circumstances and in order to regain his original position : and has an earnest desire to retake Kazerun and take measures against the Nationalists. According to news received from Kazerun, two letters from him to the Governor-General and Sykes have been intercepted at Nedun whence they were sent to Kazerun. In those letters Muhammad Ali Khan has advised them as to the way they should proceed to Nedun and then march Against Kazerun. He also expresses his readiness to accomplish the service if he is provided with ammunition. He is not satisfied with this, and with a view to engaging the Mujahidin, he has set up his men to attack the Kazerun caravans and to occupy some of the positions in the neighbourhood of Kazerun. As God is with the Mujahidin, as soon as Nasr-i-Diwan heard this he sent his men to pursue the robbers and restored all the caravans and by brave assault recovered the positions and the tower from the rebel Turks, killed about 27 men of them, and made the rest prisoners. Two of the Mujahidin were killed, one* of them being the brother of Agha Mashedi Muhammad Ibrahim, the Nationalist Mujahid, whose loss is sincerely deplored by all patriots. 'Recent news states that Muhammad Ali Khan regrets this evil action and has sent Haidar Ali Khan to Kazerun to make reparation for his action and form an alliance. We highly regret that Muhammad Ali Khan, who always made protesta tions of patriotism and professed a desire to guard Islam, should show hostility instead of helping at this moment when we are waging a holy war against our foreign enemy. We expected this man to lead the Nationalist force and retake Shiraz and. crush the British, not that we (he?) should become a tool in the hands of the enemies and attack us. Let us hope that he will rehabilitate himself by ren dering good services to the Nationalist cause and recover his good name. (Signed) ISLAH.

The road L verv unsafe and large quantities of supplies are being sent to Shiraz. Three thousand kharwars were sent recently. Shiraz. Our correspondent has communicated the following to us . f° rce i n Shiraz consists of 800 gendarmes armed with rifles; 400 Indians well armed ; 150 Governor-General’s sowars armed with the gendarmes’ rifles; four French 7 centimetre guns with 60 shells ; four old Austrian “ 7 ” guns with 80 shells; one ‘ f 8 ” gun with 60 shells and two maxim guns with 70,000 rounds of ammunition. The British have two old Austrian “ 7 ” guns and two maxims. The armoury of His Excellency Qawam-ul-Mulk is concealed outside the town His Excellency himself left Shiraz on tbe 14th instant with all the members of his family and dependents on the pretext of suppress ing the Baharlu rising. He is staying at a distance of three stages from Shiraz. ° The gendarmes are dissatisfied with the present state of affairs. The Democrats have increased their activities and are posting inflammatory placards every day. The Nasir-ul-Mulk has been released from prison and the Prince Superintendent of the telegraph office has been sent to Tehran. The Shiraz force has not made a move since its defeat at Dasht-Arjan. It is reported that it is proposed to send down Fath-ul-Mulk with a number of men. The volunteers at Kazerun eagerly await their arrival for they are tired of inactivity. Kazerun. The town and suburbs are, praise be to God, quiet. The Zargham-i-Islam (Nashw-Diwan) personally attends to all affairs and his right-handyman, Ao'ha Mashedi Muhammad Ibrahim, the Nationalist volunteer, has rendered remarkable services to his Chief and to the nation. He is in charge of all affairs relating to the army, and in this capacity he has constructed strong forti fications at the necessary points. He has despatched a sufficient force to Dasht- Arjan to stop the advance of the enemy’s force whenever it may come and finish it off there and tu.en. The good services of Meshedi Muhammad Ibrahim are worthy of the highest praise, and we pray to God to grant us many men like him. * if ■ !4 Kamarij and Daliki. For a lon°- time past the Kamarij-Daliki road has been insecure owing to the mischievous actions of certain parlies. All the measures taken by Huz- ■ h ibr-i-Xizam (Nur Muhammad Beg Daliki) have been productive of no result, consequently cVravans could not pals. They are now trying to effect a settle- ment of the dispute, and it would be a great sendee to the nation if they succeed in doing so. As a result of the attention which Ghazanfar-us-Saltaneh personally navs to affairs, this district is in perfect order and peace and the people are in comfort. Seventy loads of stores belonging to the British force, which were on their way to Shiraz, were lying at Borazjun. A request came from _ Bushire for 40 of the loads to be returned. These were returned to Bushire after haying been duly searched and the remaindei letained. According to authentic news received by us the British force, Bushire, consists of 1150 men of whom some 150 are Persians. A few days ago _ they landed some camels and elephants.

From—The Viceroy (Army Department), « To—The Secretary of State for India. Whilst agreeing that there is no imminent danger at present of a hostile advance through Persia, our proposals were made with the view to safeguard ing ourselves against the possibility of such a move in the most efficient manner. In your 3431 you stated at the same time that the War Cabinet were of opinion that the operations around Shiraz had assumed a military character. In this view, which is fully confirmed by current events, we agree. At the War Cabinet’s suggestion we proposed that the command should be exercised by a military officer appointed by us, who should undoubtedly hold General’s rank in view of the responsibility involved. Sykes’ political qualifications are recognised by us, and we consider that, up to the date of his arrival at Shiraz, he conducted his mission successfully. We think, however, having regard to present circumstances his military knowdedge is not sufficient to enable us to rely upon him to deal with the local military situation adequately. As regards the organisation of the South Persian Bifles, which, in our opinion, is the most important factor in the main tenance of our position in South Persia, we must add that Sykes has shown a lack of capacity for organising which prevents us from proposing his being retained. That Sykes might not like the position of Chief Political Officer was recognised by us and we suggested Gough as his successor for this reason. We agree that Persian susceptibilities should be disturbed as little as possible, but w r e strongly feel that the necessities of the military position are paramount and that it is necessary for us to have a free hand to control this force for which we are now paying and which is intended for the maintenance of Persian authority and the protection of Persian interests. As this Force is, in the matter of reinforcements, supplies and munitions dependent on India dual control seems to us unavoidable unless its operations are also controlled by us, and we emphasized the importance of avoiding anything in the nature of dual control in our 940 of the 20th January 1917 The above has been repeated to Tehran and has reference to Marling’s 43 of 31st January 1917, to Foreign Office, London, and your telegram of January 30th, No, 3436.136 Telegram P. ; No. 138-S., dated the 7th February 1917.

Translation of“ Communique ” dated the 2nd Babi 1, 1335 (28th December 1916J, issued by ‘ JEslah ’ (Muhammad Beza Dirisi, employe of Wassmnss) at Borasjun. KaZERTJN CoiiMTJNIQTJiS. Praise be to God, the good fortune of the nationalists and the high aims of the Zargham-i-Islam, Nasir Diwan has brought about a great victory for the splendid Islamic army at Dashtarjan, and the enemy after losing 80 men and much material were pursued to Khaneh Zenyan. The following are the details :— On the 29th Safar ( = 25th December 1916) the British force arrived at Dashtarjan from Shiraz, and on the 1 st Babi 1 (27th December 1916) they met the Mujaheddin. In the first attack Major Weldon, who was behind a maxim gun, was killed at Kal Abdosi. At night we made a surprise attack and inflicted heavy losses and killed another officer. Then the English saw their position was untenable and after firing 200 rounds from a gun, fled : we pursued them to Khaneh Zenyan and now are preparing to attack Shiraz. List op material captured. Large tents, 25 ; cartridges, 12 loads; rifles, SO; mules, 26; horses, 9 ; big gun complete. Dashtarjan, for having assisted the English, was looted.

Gough, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz. (Copy Basrah by post.) My telegram 6 , Darya Begi has received from Borasjun a copy of a ‘ £ Kazerun commu nique ” (issued by Muhammed Beza Dirisi, Wassmuss* man) describing gieat victory of nationalists and Mujahiddin over the British forces at Dashtarjin on 27th December, and stating that after losing ‘Major’ Weldon and another officer killed and 80 casualties the English fled, “we pursued to Khana Zinyan and are now preparing to attack Shiraz.” Communique gives list of material captured and adds Dashtarjin was looted for assisting the English. Probably you may think it worth while to publish counterblast.32 - On the cover addressed to Darya Begi is written ‘your report to Shiraz was intercepted at Kazerun and is there.’ Some little time a^o Farman Farma called for report on situation from Darya Begi and in it he recommended crushing at least one of the hostile Khans to intimidate the others. Enemy have apparently got hold of this. * Enclo. No. 3 . Dated the 28th Safar 1335 =24th (received 25th) December 1916.

Muhammad Khan and Agha Khan also came to Isawand from the other side. ^ One hour after sunset, a man who had been with them ainyed here and I enquired of him why Shaikh Hussain had gone there. He replied that Mirza Mohammed Khan had suggested to Shaikh Hussain and Zair Khidhar that they should assist Nasir-i-Diwan, and that Shaikh Hussain had gone there as Zair Khidhar’s representative as well as for himself. The reply he gave was to the effect that Mirza Muhammad Khan and Nur Muhammad Khan should despatch Tufangchis to Kazerun since he himself and Zair Khidhar had to check the British advance from Bushire. But Mirza Muhammad Khan did not agree to this, and said that Tufangchis from Tangis- tan and Daliki should also proceed to the assistance of the Kazerunis. As it was necessary that I should inform you of the result of their meeting at once, I despatched a special messenger. Should I obtain any information regarding the result of their meeting, I will let you know by an express messenger. Enclo. No. 4. Dated the 29th Safar 1335 =25th (received 28th) December 1916.

I beg to state that I wrote in my letter of the 27th that Nasir-i-Diwan had sent a letter to the Khans, and asked them to send him Tufangchis, and that they had had a discussion one hour after sunset. This morning an authoritative report was received that Shaikh Hussain had told Mirza Muham mad Khan that the Daliki and Borasjuni Tufangchis should be despatched to Kazerun. Mirza Muhammad Khan did not agree to this. At about midnight they decided to reply that at this time, when there is no fighting around Kazerun, there is no need of sending reinforcements there, but that they will be ready to despatch Tufangchis and ammunition to his help when fight ing occurs. They sent the above reply to Nasir-i-Diwan by the same messenger who had brought his letter. But according to what another person told me, the reason why they did not agree to despatch Tufangchis at this juncture is that they^ are afraid lest the Bushire route should be closed. At present they have replied to Nasir-i-Diwan that there is no need to send Tufangchis. Enclo. No. 5. Dated the 30th Safar 1335 ( = 26th December 1916). From —Agha Muhammad Quli, Telegraph Ghulam, Borazjun, To—H. G. Chick, Esq., etc., etc., Bushire. News received from Kazemn is as follows :— Nasir-i-Diwan went to see Salar-i-Nasrat, and on his departure he made signs to his men to arrest and imprison Salar-i-Nusrat. Directly after thishe went to the gendarmerie barracks. As a matter of pretence they made two breaches in the walls and pushed into the barracks, but they had made certain arrangements previously with Majid Khan, the Gendarmerie captain at Kazerun, and the gendarmes surrendered at once. Nasir-i-Diwan took all their arms and ammunition, and disarmed the gendarmes. After capturing the gendarmerie barracks, he despatched Meshedi Muhammad Ibrahim, his Parrash-bashi, to Pul-i-Abgiaeh with a number of men, who arrested Muham mad Ismail Khan, who was a loyal servant of the Government, and brought him to Kazerun. Nasir-i-Diwan has seized every place as far as the Main- kutal caravanserai, and he has disarmed gendarmes whenever he found them. Yesterday, the ^7th instant, news was received that Nasir-i-Diwan had captured the posts as far as Khan-i-Zinian ; but the truth of this report is not yet certain. A messenger came from Nasir-i-Diwan to Ghazanfar-us-Saltaneh, Shaikh Hussain and Zair Khidhar 9 days ago, asking for their support. A reply was sent him that at present he did not need more than his own Kazerun men, but that whenever he required more they would reinforce him. Pive days ago also a messenger came from Nasir-i-Diwan to Ghazanfar-us- Saltaneii and the other Khans, urging them to despatch tufangchis. Ghazanfar- us-Saltaneh replied that he would send him about _ 100 men in a few days. He is trying to collect a number of tufangchis here in secret, and to despatch them to Kazerun in the name of the Mullas, so that lie himself should not incur any responsibility. In short, he has sent this reply to Nasir-i- Diwan, though it is not certain whether he will send that number of men or not. He has simply written to Nasir-i-Diwan that he should go on with his operations, while they would afford him assistance if he required it. I do not know what reply has been given him by Shaikh Hussain and Zair Khidhar Yesterday, the 27th, news -was received that all the inhabitants of Kazerun had revolted saying that Nasir-i-Diwan has rebelled against the Government, and that they are not responsible for his actions. It seems as if there is some machination in this report. To-day, the 28th, a messenger came from Nasir-i-Diwan to Ghazanfar-us- Saltaneh again, and had a letter for the latter. The purport of the letter is not known yet. Quli Khan Muntasir-i-Diwan and Karbalai Abbas are still occupying the same caravanserai at Kamarij, which they had captured. With regard to the relations between Nur Muhammad Khan, Sardar Khan and Mulla Ali Wais Khan, on the 26th instant, Mulla Ali Wais’s wife and daughter were taken to Kunartakhtah from Daliki, on condition that Mulla Ali Wais should send back Karbalai Abbas, an inhabitant of Daliki, and Amir Quli Khan, the son of Mulla Ewaz. No news has been received regard ing the settlement of this affair. Pakhr-us-Saltaneh is still at Daliki, and spreading false and unfounded reports, whereas before Muhammad Reza and Mirza Ali Kazeruni were at it, now there are three of them. Encio. No. 6 .

Letters couched in friendly terms and inviting support are arriving constantly from all sections of Kashkuli Khans. Muhammed Khan Hujabr has sent two letters to Residency and others to friendly Khans urging that permission should be given him by Sykes to reoccupy Khumarij and thus cut communications between Kazernn and Dashtistan.

(Repeated Bushire.) Bushire telegram 11 . • i discuss , e(i possibilities with Farman Farma and Sykes. Former’s idea is Muhammed Khan is not strong by himself, but merely tool of Soulet’s whose near relative he is. Governor-General does not wish definitely emplov w 7 et affair untl1 he kn ? ws our P lans - He sa Js if we employ Soulet after will at once say he wants 150,000 tomans, guns and ammunition and rifles like CJawam (m fact he did say so to me at Kumisha). Farman Farma thinks on payment of thirty or forty thousand tomans for definite action showing that he is tor us, and monthly payment of another ten thousand for six months feoulet would do exactly what is require of him. There would be no necessitv to provide him with weapons which might be turned against ourselves. If Government would agree to these payments we would have no further trouble with him. I told Farman Farma distinctly we would not pay one penny for promises and he agrees it would be foolish but he wishes to know whether we would agree to pay by results as in bis opinion this is only way to treat Soulet except the alternative of smashing him which is merely question of force which at present we do not possess. Payments would not in any case extend beyond next autumn by which time we should have sufficient force with Indian troops and reorganized South Persian Bifles to deal with any opposition. Political situation also by that time should have improved. Payments should not aggregate more than 120,000 tomans. Sykes and self both agree with his views. Meanwhile he keeps them all expectant but does not commit himself. Kindly let me know whether this meets with your approval and whether payment can be sanctioned. 76 No. 101-P., dated Shiraz, the 9th December 1916 (received 13th January 1917). From— Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Inspector-Gene ral, South Persia Rifles, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to forward herewith, for your information, enclosed copy of my letter No. 100, which I have addressed to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister and Envoy Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran, re first impressions of the Ears Gendarmerie.Enclo. to Serial No. 76. No. 100-P., dated Shiraz, the 9th December 1916 (Confidential). From— Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Inspector-Gene ral, South Persia Rifles, To— Sir Charles Marling, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty's Minister and Envoy Plenipotentiary, Tehran. I have the honour to give my first impressions of the Pars Gendarmerie which was taken over by me nominally on August 22nd (1st Somboleh) hut actually on November 16th, at the approximate strength ol 2,800 officers and men or about one-quarter of the force which I am commissioned to raise. 2 . The day after my arrival at Shiraz I visited the Governor-General and then went to the barracks and formally took over the force as already reported. Since that date Major Hunter and the other officers have been working unremittingly to establish order out of chaos. The officers are mostly Teheranis, distinctly better educated than Indian officers, with a knowledge of Drench or English in some cases. Their Chief, Yavar Eath-ul-Mulk, reported to have rendered great services by imprisoning the Germans taking Gendarmerie of the Eirman Earma. His position has naturally suffered from our arrival, but he appears to be accept ing the inevitable with good grace. Of the other officers many are glad of the change and some are pro bably the reverse, but our orders are carried out and there is not much overt opposition. As the Persian Government have not agreed to my taking over the Gendarmerie the actual position is one for thankfulness and is mainly due to the unswerving support of His Highness the Eirman Earma, who has thereby added to the list of eminent services rendered to the British Government. The men are glad of the change which ensures them regular pay, food and clothes and their tone towards us is one of willing and cheerful obedience. 3. The barracks require some immediate repairs which have been taken in hand but, generally speaking, they are insanitary and unfit for human occupation. It is, however, only fair to state that they are clean ; the stables in particular are well kept. It is intended to build new barracks on a fine site 1-| miles out as soon as possible. The horses were hardly worth the feeding in many cases and there were few serviceable saddles, but these grave defects are being strenuously remedied. 4 . The Artillery is remarkably good, making our two mountain guns look painfully obsolete. It comprises the following: 2 Q. F. 75 M. M. Schneider Field guns (1 at present at Lar), 1 Krupp 8 C M. Field gun (at Kazerun), Q. E 75 M. M. Schneider mountain guns, 2 7-pdr. B. L. mountain guns. Major Rothwell, who is in charge of the Column section of mountain guns, is training men to work the quick-firing mountain guns and is amazed at their intelligence, aptitude and zeal. Within a week they have picked up much of the English drill, giving the English words of command. Altogether my impression of the Artillery is very favourable and in Persia it is the Artillery wliich counts. 5. Hr. Woollatt, of the Telegraphs, has taken up his old position with the force. His influence and popularity are considerable and I consider him a valuable asset. The state of the Hospital Staff, the Hispensary and the operating instruments are almost European and much impressed me. The kitchen with its hu 2 :e and valuable copper cauldrons was in a bad state, the water being drawn from a polluted channel. In this connexion the Swedes appear to have given little attention to sanitation, a huge cesspool vitiating the atmosphere just outside the kitchen. The necessary improvements are being made and in a short time the present barracks will be as sanitary as can he expected. 6 . Eeoruits of a good type are offering themselves in considerable num bers, but w r e cannot handle many at present with our tiny body of five officers. 7. It is desirable to explain that it is intended to keep Persian officers in command of units as far as possible. The British and non-commissioned officers will act as staff and instructors. Without them the organisation would36 kck backbone, but it seems desirable to adopt a system which will stimulate the initiative ot and give rank and position to the Persians, whose intelligence has a ways een of a high order. It is not intended to employ Indian instructors, excep at iiushne and Bunder Abbas, as they are considered to be unsuitable by my officers and myself. J 8 . One difficulty in Persia is, that the troops raised in the Uplands hate and fear- service m the Garmsir or hot country, where they fall ill very rapidly during the summer. It is intended to increase the force now existing at _un er Abbas for service between Bunder Abbas and Dowlatabad and between Bashire and Konar Takhteh This scheme vdll eventually help the Govern ment ol India by providing garrisons for the Gulf Ports and thereby obviate tne necessity for locking up so many Indian troops in the Persian Gulf. 9. Bodies of men are being equipped and despatched to guard the roads to the north and south, while 200 men form part of the Kawam’s force, which is about to take ^ the field against the Baharlus. There is a distinct lack of Arms and Ammunition, but two months hence one thousand Lee-Metford rifles may be expected via Bushire^ although that road is only open upon the payment of lackmail and then with no guarantee of permanency. It is, however, pro- posed that I accompany the Pirman Firman to Kazerun with the column and other troops in January. The Firman Firma hopes to be able to treat with each petty Khan separately and to arrange for the entire route to be taken over by the South Persia Bifles, Of course risks will have to be run but, in my opinion, this scheme should be attempted in preference to any other. The Khans are now, more or less, ready to make their submission to their own Goi eminent and naturally prefer doing this to accepting arrangements dic tated by British troops. Moreover, a force descending on their backs cuts cff their retreat to the hills. 10 . In conclusion, I am favourably impressed with the force, which I have taken over. There will be many difficulties to overcome, but I am confident of ultimate success, provided that the Indian column is kept at my disposal, until the new force is ready to fight the tribes, and that I am given, when available, the most modern instruments of war in the shape of aeroplanes, armoured motor cars and perhaps even a &lt;£ Tank . 55 11 .

Ends. 82 {Received with Army Department memorandum No. 1052, dated the 24th January 1917.) Telegram No. 940, dated the 20th January 1917. From—The Viceroy (Army Department), To—The Secretary of State for India. South Bersia. —The concrete facts which we have before us are as follows :— First. —It appears from all information that the Turks in vicinity of Baghdad will at an early date be strengthened materially by as much as four divisions possibly. Second. —The unrest in Southern Persia may be ascribed to Turkish and German influence among the local tribesmen. It is possible from these two facts that the aim of the enemy to push bodies of troops towards Afghanistan with a view to induce the Amir to take sides against us has not been lost sight of by them. It may be the intention of the Turks in order to achieve their ambi tions— ( 1 ) To endeavour to overwhelm Maude at Kut. ( 2 ) To await the floods and the hot weather to keep Maude to his present position with sufficient troops whilst making use of the bulk of their forces for a movement through Persia. This movement is likely to follow a south-eastern direction via Ispahan in view of the Russian menace to their communi cations should the Turks advance via Tehran.The attack on Maude would be favoured by climatic conditions if under taken during the cold weather, while the movement through Persia would preferably be an operation for the hot weather. On the success or failure of the plans as above outlined depends the deve lopment of the Shiraz situation. The enemy plans in Persia are impeded so long as our present position on the Tigris is maintained • their move eastward is checked ; and the arrival in South Persia of organized enemy forces is rendered improbable. It would appear that the features of the present situation at Shiraz are— The attack on Kazerun was primarily directed against the Persian Oovernor Parman Parma who is known to be friendly to us. The tribal forces engaged were robber bands instigated by the German Agent Wassmuss and unchecked by the Soulet, but caravans and individuals are apparently permitted by them to move up and down the Bushire-Shiraz road on the payment of toll. As for the best method of dealing with the situation we consider it advisable:— Firstly .—The South Persian Bifles to be raised and organised efficiently on the same lines as units of the Indian Army. The control and maintenance of this force to be placed under the Commander-in-Chief in India. The latter would nominate an experiened General Officer to exercise command and to be the supreme British authority up to the borders of Baluchistan, under Pield Service Regulations, Part 2, chapter 111, section S. Subject to the instructions given him by the Government of India his authority must be supreme in all matters. His instructions will be issued by the Government of India under the orders of the Home Government, and after reference has been made to the Minister, Tehran, w r hen necessary so that the latter would thus have an opportunity to guide the policy to be followed. This officer must have freedom to act according to the needs of the situation—in judging which he would have the advice of his local political officers. In matters beyond their competence the advice of the Minister at Tehran would be taken. The Government of India would give him instructions in regard to the general military policy governing the mission, strength and object of his force from time to time. These instructions will be framed by the Government of India, according to the general policy of His Majesty's Government and after the advice of the Minister, Tehran, has been taken. Secondly .—Trade on the Bushire-Shiraz road to be encouraged, and for this purpose the rebellious Khans outside Bushire should be permitted to quietly re-establish relations with us without promise being made them of any thing in the future. This policy has been previously proposed by us, but it has not found favour at Tehran hitherto. In view of the foregoing as to your particular question we advise :— (i) Against the occupation of the plains country between Daliki and Bushire as it might result in complications with the hill tribes and render necessary an advance into the hills, i.e., a further commitment, if it is to affect the situation at Shiraz ; also the climatic conditions would be very severe for the troops after April. (ii) There is no need for reinforcement Lingah or Bunder Abbas. Steps are in train to send an escort with staff and instructors to Shiraz via Bunder Abbas which will be available to reinforce Sir P. Sykes if the situation there should demand it. (Hi) We estimate that, in addition to the Bushire garrison, two mountain guns, two battalions, and some mounted troops would meet the requirements of the limited operations in the plains country north of Bushire, which is deprecated in («) above.40 three BritfsKsfcme^or/wfth SykeS se , ndm S a party of ten officers and fl%- comLnv monnlT^fw h an , esc0 . r ‘ °f one battalion of Indian infantry, one proy?deJfrom India bn? art ! 1 er y. 11 and caTalr y drafts.

C hief of the Imperial General Staff and the (ro\ eminent of India accordingly. 0) It® u ?g es * ed Jkat Sir Percy Sykes could be used as Chief Political Adviser to the General Officer Commanding the Porces, South Persia ; we do not, however, press this point. Should Sir P feykes be recalled, then it is suggested that the Chief Political Officer on the Staff of the General Officer Commanding should be Gough. 3 (m) INo other suggestions present themselves to us but it is desired to emphasise the paramount importance of avoiding : (а) anything in the nature of dual control; ( б ) any complications which, without decided compensatin o&gt; advantages, is likely to result in further military commit ments. As the local opinion is that ^ the spring migration towards Shiraz of the . hamsieh and Kashgai tribes will certainly increase the risk of complications m Shiraz, especially as the movement of troops from the coast will be impeded by the hot weather, we hope to meet this risk in time to prevent complications by the support of Sir Percy Sykes immediately.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Repeated to Bunder Abbas and Bushire.) Your telegram 97-S. I agree with Consul, Bunder Abbas’ suggestion in his telegram 51. Telegram P., No. 38-F., dated the 23rd (received 24th) January 1917. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Addressed to London Foreign Office.) I think proposal is excellent if practicable. Intention underlying Government of India’s recommendations is to carry out our policy in Southern Persia with a minimum reference to Tehran. System is working satisfactorily, so far as my limited knowledge goes, in Kerman and East Persia. I am not by any means sure, however, that, until the General Officer who is appointed has an adequate force at his disposal to compel respect (and this he certainly would not have under arrangements contemplated at present), it would be feasible in Pars, where our interests are centred and which is in so much closer touch with Tehran and where tribal chiefs are so much more susceptible to Tehran influences than is the case with Sistan and Kerman. Closest co-operation ^ as ^ regards Pars questions—and not mere casual reference to Legation—will, it seems to me, be necessary for the present, and in such conditions I think proposed appointment would have excellent results as calculated to co-ordinate our efforts. General Officer will presumably be represented to Persian Government as organiser of Southern Persia Eifles and nominally in their service. Gough would in my opinion be especially well qualified to act as Political Officer on account of his knowledge of general situation in Tehran. As regards Government of India observations on causes of existing unrest present move is in my opinion due less to German influences (Although German agents are making capital out of move for their own ends) than to dislike of local Khans great and small to prospect of seeing organisation of efficient public force and consequent diminution of their own imnortance and curtailment of opportunity of brigandage and blackmail. P ortailce and Secret There is some apprehension on part of Eussian Minister also regarding fresh Turkish move x in this direction. He could not give me the grounds of his apprehension but they are based I gather on despatch of reinforcements on a large scale to Baratoff. 1 Effect in Ears would be very serious if such a move on the part of Turkey takes place and has any considerable success. ^ This is with reference to Government of India’s tele°Tam 99-S to Secretary of State. ° ' *'42 87 '{Received with Army Department memorandum No. 804, dated the 18th January 1917.)

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. (Addressed Tehran.) As it may be convenient to you to be forewarned I repeat for your personal information translation of following German wireless message intercepted last nigbt -.—Begins Norddeutsche Allegemeine Zeitung publishes letter which the present British Ambassador in Holland despatched on April 7th, 1915, from Tehran to British Consul-General, Shiraz. This letter written in midst of war expresses annoyance at fact that Bussia is seeking the hegomony of Persia. Townley writes “ my time in Persia is quickly drawing to a close. In any case I am going. I have naturally no intention of simply going on leave or of ever returning. I have long expected this termination to my career. Yes indeed this conviction came because I was convinced that our friends of the Narev clan would become weary of a colleague who would not quietly look on while they devoured Persia at their leisure”. Townley then goes on to enumerate various methods extensively practised to prevent spread of British influence and intense hatred of all classes for Russia, a large proportion of which hatred we have to share on account of being their allies. The same paper further publishes a document from Government of India in which a plan is discussed with reference to Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 by which sphere allotted to Russian commercial interests should be retrospectively won back again to British influence. Further, in a confidential despatch of the State Department to British Foreign Office addressed to Lord Crewe on March 4th, 1914, it is stated that every intelligent measure for facilitating trade from south up the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan route which is not only in interests of Indian trade but also of Russian (message here breaks off). Ends. 105 (Received with Army Department memorandum Eo. 899, dated the 20th January 1917.) Cipher telegram No. 12-C., dated the 16th January 1917. From—The Officer Commanding, Kerman, To— Sir P. Sykes, Shiraz. (Repeated Chief of the General Staff and Bunder Ahbas.) Your No. 94. The route from Bunder Abbas via Tangizindan to Daulatabad and thence to Saidabad direct across Dashtiab is the one I w ould recommend. The Tangi- zagh route is not known to me and I am informed by local authorities that sup plies would be difficult. The Tangizagh route might be preferable if column could carry supplies to Doraeah. The time of year, scarcity of provisions and lack of transport will render the collection of supplies difficult, but I will endeavour to lay out supplies as far as Niriz. In any case the column should carry 10 days’ reserve rations and forage. Kindly inform me as early as pos sible regarding composition of force, whether British or Indian, and number and description of animals ; as fodder wdll have to be collected from a distance and is particularly hard to obtain. Also kindly inform me as soon as known regarding approximate dates. /aaNMriassHH&amp;anNMHpi k( Pei, n aij WO! 106 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 964, dated the 22nd January 1917,) Cipher telegram No. 61, dated the 17th January 1917. From—The Officer Commanding, Bunder Abbas, To— Sir P. Sykes. (Repeated Chief of the General Staff, Delhi ; and Kerman.) Reference your telegram No. dated 14th January. It appears from concensus of local opinion that Tangizagh route is pre ferable to Tangizindan, The former route is little used now except by Arab traders solely because of disturbed state of district through which the road passes, otherwise from point of view of length of journey, water supplies and natural difficulties its superiority is unanimously proclaimed by merchants and others. By making short detour to the east the first difficult s“ut can be circumvented. Owing to the rainy season the shortage of water, which is usual at second stage, would perhaps not be great at the time column would probably be marching. Good political effect might be obtained by inarch up this road especially as Qavvam would be operating on left flank and risk of attacks is minimised by size of force. By column being self-contained as to certain supplies possibility of scarcity of these supplies at certain stages up to Saidabad could be met ; sufficient rations to cover contingencies have accordingly been demanded. Details for Kerman should be diverted at Saidabad. It is presumed these details will accompany the force. 107 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 1025, dated the 23rd January 1917.)

A telegram from Sultanabad says, that after finding Burujird unoccupied by the Turks, the Russian troops returned to Sultanabad. The pro-Russian Bairanwand, chief, Ali Mardan Khan, has been made Governor of Burujird, and holds that place with 200 sowars he has raised, and he co-operated with the Russians subsequently.

Telegram P., No. 3436, dated the 30th {received 31st) January 1917. From— His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Army Department). Regarding the situation in South-West Persia. The question has again been under the consideration of the War Cabinet with reference to your tele gram No. 940 and Marling’s telegram No. 39 of the 23rd January. They are not convinced, from such information as is in their possession, that there is imminent or grave danger on any strong Turkish advance into the interior of Persia which would seriously compromise the situation in Pare in the near future. It is realised by the War Cabinet, however, that it is desirable to render more secure the position of the South Persia Rifles at Shiraz, d he Government of India have been instructed to send immediately for this purpose the reinforcements mentioned in the last paragraph of the Viceroy’s telegram which will amount approximately to 1,000 men with 10 officers and 53 British instructors subject to the latter having been asked for by Sir P. Sykes for the training of the South Persia Rifles. In regard to the position of Sir P. Sykes, great hesitation is felt by the War Cabinet in his supersession by a General of the active army. Eirstly, he is anofficer haviog an exceptional knowledge of Persia, and, secondly, he is a persona gratissima to Persians generally and to the Governor of Pars, while Sir P. Sykes’ personal position would be so injuriously affected by a change that he would be hardly likely to agree to remain as Chief Political Officer to the General in question. Moreover the War Office feel that such an appoint ment is likely to give the South Persia Rifles and indeed the whole situation a military appearance, by which the suspicions of the Persian Government might justly be excited and an inconvenient precedent for similar action elsewhere might be constituted. If we were to insist upon the appointment of a General, even nominally under Persian control, the above might perhaps hold good. Upon the foregoing consideration I would he glad to know your views. 113 Telegram P., No. 147-S., dated the 1st February 1917.

Following sent to the Foreign Office, No. 43, 31st January. Please refer to your telegram No. 35. So far as I am aware though Sykes had no previous gendarmerie expe rience his other qualifications seemed excellent and quite sufficient when he6 was selected at which time no serious local opposition® to his mission was anticipated but it appears prudent in view of altered circumstances and pros pect of military operations, if only on a small scale, that officer possessing experience of tribal warfare should be placed in command of forces in Pars. This seems more necessary as last reports from Shiraz both my own and those of Persian Government, point to a deterioration in the situation. Though my information is not very clear yet, a positive success of the Kawam’s expedition against Baharlus appears problematical. At the same time in order to prevent his defection it will be none the less necessary to finance him. Although I think situation requires presence of prudent soldier with experience I do not think there is any necessity for appointment of a General Officer and it might perhaps be better, in order to avoid consequence foreseen in last paragraph of your telegram, not to invest him with large powers suggested by Government of India. He should, however, be in a position to calf on co-operation of Officer Commanding, Bushire, if the necessity should arise. 119 Telegram P., No; 151-S., dated the 2nd February 1917.

Beyond that attached to the Infantry portion of the escort, equipping it on the normal scale, no assistance can he given from India in respect of transport. You should please report periodically the progress in these preparations.

Cox, General Headquarters, To—British Minister, Tehran. Please refer to your telegram 368, December 18th, mentioning sensitive ness of Persian Government regarding our activities in Dizful Shustar region. I am not sure whether you are fully aware, in absence of any special report from me on subject, of the greatly enhanced importance which that region has possessed for us since commencement of war. Before the war the chronic internal disorders and feuds which prevailed there were of little concern to us except in so far as they affected our railway projects. Advance of Turks into Persia has greatly altered the position and the locality, lying as it does on the only feasible lines of advance from Hamadan and Kermanshah, and also on alternative line from Baghdad, has become an important strategic outpost on our flank. Both Dizful and Shushtar are convenient channels for passage of oil and other necessary commodities to the enemy which need watching and Dizful especially is a convenient point from which to watch for enemy advance. On these grounds it is essential that our pacific control and influence should be as strong as possible, so that the alternative of Mili tary occupation may be avoided. I have consequently been obliged to post political officers at both places, but their activities operate no less in the interests of the Persian Government than of ourselves, as is demonstrated by a recent telegraphic Military report from Officer Commanding, Ahvaz, from which I quote the following for your information -.—Begins, During my visit to Dizful with the moveable column I was impressed with the change in the political situation in the last few months. This change has been brought about by the presence of Mr. Soane as Political Officer in permanent residence. The result of his activities which have been made possible by the military operations in the spring and the presence of troops at Shush has proved extremely beneficial to the people and trade has trebled. Ends. I trust the foregoing considerations and facts wfill assist you in combating Persian sensibilities in regard to our doings in Northern Arabistan. On our part we will do our best to preserve facade of Persian administrative control which, however, does not exist. - 71 Telegram R., No. 19-F., dated (and received) the 20th January 1917. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. (Addressed Tehran ; repeated Bushire.) Situation Shiraz. Town quiet. Price of bread reduced by subsidy mentioned in my telegram No. 215-P., December 27th. Kazerun and passes between there and Dashti-Arjan still held back by tribesmen. Posts not coming in. A few mules arriving occasionally with goods. Fath-ul-Mulk has gone out with local levies to try to reach Kazerun; his complete success is problematical and in any case will be expensive. Soulet having received Shah’s khillat has returned south. He sent letters to Governor-General professing obedience and readiness to carry out instructions, but intimates that before suppressing rebellion he requires money. Governor-General urges on me to promise 10,000 to 15,000 tomans as first instalment. If on the receipt of this payment Soulet suppresses disturbances, he will have shown he is ready to work loyally and will in that case require further sums. But if after receipt of 10,000 tomans he does nothing we will know where we are. Parman Farma is of opinion (and I agree with him) that Soulet will do nothing unless we pay him before hand. It is so essential to keep Kashgai tribesmen quiet until we are strong enough to be independent, that I consider it well worth while to secure tranquillity by payment, though I would makepayments on as small a scale as possible. Other alternative is known to you— to smash Soulet either by diplomacy or force. Former method is very doubtful and force we do not possess even with reinforcements 1,000 Indian troops asked for by Sykes. South Persia Rifles can be looked upon as negligible quantity for the present—perhaps even as a danger until their British officers have arrived and have gained confidence of the men.

Of course troops for this purpose can be provided by me, but only at the expense of major operations in which we are now engaged on the Tigris or contemplating on the Euphrates later To me it seems regrettable that Sykes should send these small detachments about in a partially unsettled country at the present time and so invite their capture. I shall be glad to receive early instructions as it will take a little time to collect a force large enough to deal thoroughly with the situation. 186 (Received with Army Department memorandum No 15194, dated the 27th December 1916.)

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Addressed Tehran; repeated Bushire, Basrah and Ispahan.) Kazerun affair. Sykes’ clear line telegram of this evening. I have consulted Governor-General in regard to situation which is very serious but cannot at present be said to be precarious. Column ran up against strong force of enemy in impregnable position and have retired with loss of one British officer dangerously wounded, 4 South Persia Bifles killed and6 wounded and 1 Indian wounded. Force reaches Chenar Rahdar (8 miles from Shiraz) to-morrow and halts there to avoid suspicion of rout. Position here at present safe, but rumours will of course be busy and discontent about price of bread may lead to troubles. Committee is being formed and will deal with question to-morrow. I am giving sum of 12,000 tomans to Committee to-morrow to pay bakers to reduce prices for a month (although prices are very high there is still grain to be bought for a price). This payment will have to be renewed in month’s time unless we can get wheat in meanwhile and will continue monthly until we do. Presuming that it is desired to keep our hold on Southern Persia it is essential at all costs to keep people with us. Following is Farman Farma’s idea with which I concur. As regards situation it may be said that all the Khans between Bushire and here already known as enemies are in this affair. If Bushire sends a Column with intention of attacking Dashti Chiefs it should be strong one at least 3,000 with adequate mountain artillery. A weak force which might get into difficulties would only increase our anxieties. My own idea is Officer Commanding Column from Bushire should not venture into hills with less than above, but a strong demonstration would much assist. As regards Kawam, my own idea is that he is to be trusted. There is no doubt that he has friends in enemy’s Camp, but his interest is obviously on side which pays. If we show distrust we may frighten him into going against us. Soulet has still not yet shown his hand but continues to send friendly messages. Governor-General is sending him a Khillat from Shiraz to-morrow. 189 Telegram R., No. 25, dated (and received) the 27th December 1916. From —His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. Your telegram No. 1062-S. My calculations are as follows :— Flour at Karachi 8 seers per rupee (actual rates not known to me). Kran value taken at one kran equivalent to ten annas. Shiraz man equals seven and a half pounds. Ireight Karachi to Bushire one anna or two shais a man, therefore value in Bushire seventeen shai per man or, say, one kran for safe margin. Donkey carriage Bushire to Shiraz via Firuzabad 40 tomans a Kharrar of 100 mans or 4 krans per man. Total value of flour landed here 5 krans a man or 175 tomans per ton (equivalent to about 3 and a half tomans). I would sell at rate of 4 krans—little below market rate—which would be loss of 10 tomans a Kharvar or 35 tomans a ton. As time is drawing on, I doubt if donkeys will be available to carry more than oOO tons at the outside, as they all move north in spring. In any case they can only he got with goodwill of Soulet with whom I am endeavouring to keep on good terms. I venture to urge urgent despatch is of utmost importance. 190 Telegram P., No. 369, dated the 27th (received 28th) December 1916.

Telegraph line-man, Borasjun, writing December 25th reports Khan of Borasjun replied to Nasri Divan’s former letter, promising to send 108 men as reinforcement, for which he is trying to arrange in name of Ulema to hide his own complicity and encouraging Nasri Divan to continue his operations. On December 24th another letter was received from Nasri Divan who is apparently pressing for reinforcements. He also reports Fakr-es-Sultaneh and Wassmuss Agent busy with propaganda. 193 Telegram P., No. 778-F., dated the 27th (received 28th) December 1916. p rom _ His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, T 0 The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed to London Foreign Office, sent to Basrah, Shiraz.) My immediately preceding telegram. His Maiesty’s Consul, Shiraz, is in my opinion right in attaching import- ,nce to supplying foodstuffs. I propose therefore to approve his action m issisting Committee. I also endorse his recommendation for at least a demonstration from 3ushire if a more serious operation cannot be undertaken, as being calculated o detain rebel forces that might otherwise be co lected against Shiraz and to liscourage Soulet from overt hostility. This should make matters safe during vinter. There will, however, be a critical period m the spring when the migra- ion of Kashghai and Khamseh tribes brings them close to Shiraz. I think we hould be prepared if movement turns out to be as formidable as the Consul md Governor-General think, to take much more serious action either from Bushire orfrom Bunder Abbas as Sykes has already suggested oreventrom joth directions. I have rather less confidence in Kawam’s loyalty than Consul seerns to have although from what I hear of his character it seems to me unlikely that he would venture to join present movement.W!fi' 'im mrntmmt Telegram P., No. 1077-S., dated the 28th December 1916.

Your telegram No. 175. Kawam. I am convinced Kawam is to be trusted so long as we treat him rightly. Last few events have somewhat scared hi eh but I have restored bis confidence—'with difficulty. I have discussed with Sykes and Farman Farma policy to be adopted and both agree we must keep him on our side at any cost as a counterbalance against Soulet. Latter is much more inclined to side against us than Kawam and if be actually joins hostile party Kawam’s assistance is practically all we have to rely on. This has been traditional policy in past and must be our own until we have a South Persian Bifle force strong enough to render such policy unnecessary. Kawam is young and not of strong character and bis actions are ruled by feelings of the moment and arrest Of Mustaffa Khan made him nervous. Knowing bis w-eakness I consider we must (1) show no signs of distrust, (2) supply him with necessary money to carry out bis Babalu campaign, and (3) pay sum of money due him on bis (claims ?) in regard to which I am sending further telegram to India. 196 Telegram R., No. 27 (217 ?)-F., dated the 28th (received 29th) December 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Repeated to Tehran, Basrah and Bushire.) Kawam’s money affairs. By payment of £2,782 Kawam’s claim (see my telegram No. 138-F., November 3rd) has been reduced from 131,801 tomans 6 krans to 1,213,319 krans. His expenses on sowars and footmen and bis Indian gunners, etc., for months of Mubarram and Safar amount to about 13,000 tomans. His total claims, therefore, against us now come to 131,331 tomans 9 krans. He owes money to bank as follows:—Tomans 20,000 borrowed in August and September, before my arrival at Shiraz. 20,000 tomans, vide my telegram No. 131 (?138) above-mentioned. Another 22,000 guaranteed by me, acting on Cox’s instructions dated November 30th. He is paying interest to bank on 60,000 tomans above at 12 per cent. In addition I have given him an advance of 30,000 tomans in accordance with your telegram No. 971-S., December 5th. The only payments we will have to make for him in future are for gunners, etc., lent to him, as the prisoners have at last been taken over by the Governor- General and be has dismissed the sowars and footmen employed for guarding them, and in safeguarding the town. i i iI beg that the amount for which he has given me accounts, viz., krans 1,213,319 and tomans 17,500 for Muharram [he has not yet handed me accounts for month of Safar, but they amount to about 4,500 tomans] may be paid at the earliest possible date. Delay is making him suspicious of our intentions, and besides he cannot possibly go out on his expedition until his affairs are settled. Governor-General also begs of me to settle Ka^am’s accounts as soon as possible- 198 Telegram R., No. 251t), dated (and received) the 29th December 1916. From—The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. Vice-Consul, Bunder Abbas, reports following;—On night of 25th- 26th caravan proceeding Kerman, attacked by 50 “Arab” tribesmen (i.e., men belonging to one of the Khamseh tribes under Kawam) under Mustaffa Khan, 1 ' miles from Bunder Abbas. One hundred camels with loads, property of Persian merchants carried off. Caravan escort pursued robbers and fight ensued in -which casualties occurred on both sides. His Majesty’s Consuls, Kerman and Shiraz, informed. 199 Telegram P., No. 782-F., dated the 29th (received 30th) December 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Addressed London Foreign Office, sent to Shiraz and Basrah.) Kawam can hardly be called a subordinate Governor-General. He is hereditary Chief of Khamseh Arab tribes and it is necessary to keep him friendly as a counterpoise to Souiet-ed-Dowleh Kashgai Illkhani of other great tribe in Pars whose attitude, though not yet overtly so, is unquestionably hostile towards us. Though Kawam appears to be a worthless character his defection would, indeed, be very serious situation and I consider goodwill to him is necessary. To estimate amount is difficult. Accounts, which His Majesty’s Consul con siders satisfactory, have been produced by him, showing outstanding expenditure of tomans 131,800 incurred by his late father and himself which Government of India agrees with me should be paid to him {vide telegram No. 970-S., Decem ber 5th, to Secretary of State for India, from Government of India). This has been reduced to tomans 121,332 by payment of £2,782, but again increased to tomans 134,332 for expenses on account of footmen, sowars and Indian gunners for months of Muharram and Safar. I consider this sum should be paid imme diately. # . In addition to this he is asking for about 80 003 tomans,^ which His Majesty’s Consul urges should be given him to finance expedition against Baharlus on Kerman border. So long as we treat Kawam well, i.e., pay him, His Majesty’s Consul considers him trustworthy. Whether these payments will suffice depends on developments. Governor-General appears to be fairly confident that, provided troops at Bushire are permitted to operate in the direction of Kazerun and Kawam kept friendly, situation can be mastered, and I quite concur in this view. Sirdar Motazid, late Vice-Governor of Pars, has also confirmed this. This is with reference to your telegram 541.201 i 12 Telegram R., No. 1311-C., dated the 28th (received 29th) December 191d.

Operation viewed as reconnaissance in force proved impossibility of forcing Pass in face of lar^e number of well-armed riflemen and notorious difficulty of ground. General impression is that experience useful and losses extraordinarily slight. Moral of force excellent. Column will return to Shiraz 28th December. If decided to use Bushire force two brigades will be needed. I should strongly deprecate mere demonstration but capture and holding of Borasjun would be very useful. Position serious but column safe in vicinity of Shiraz for the present. Consul concurs with above. Barman Parma not upset. 202 Telegram R., No. 218-F., dated (and received) the 30th December 1916.

Soulet has been written to, that in order to show his loyalty, he should put down Kazerun rising. If he does not attempt to do so he will be recog nized as unfriendly. Kawam is ready to move out on his expedition and has expressed his readiness to Governor-General and myself to join attack on Soulet should such become necessary.

The main trade route from both Bunder Abbas and Lingah to Shiraz lies through Lar and transport for both ports is drawn from this route, hence if it is decided to despatch 750 tons through both ports I fear that it will cause congestion of merchandise and set-back to trade between Bunder Abbas and Shiraz which is now considerable.

Consul and Govern or-General concur. Sykes reports that all information points to view “ that we are opposed by tribes in Bars and strong party in Shiraz hostile to introduction of law and order by foreign and particularly by Indian force ” and that movement is encouraged by known weakness of his column which was previously reported to be at least one brigade. I hope that his recommendations will be adopted as from various (reports ?) which have reached me here I think situation is quite as grave as he represents it. 25 Telegram R., No. 165, dated the 6th (received 7th) January 1917.

Following No. 100839. is in continuation of my telegram of December 28th,10 It seems that the situation at Shiraz is not so critical as indicated by the reports up to December 28th. The morale of the unsuccessful force which now lias withdrawn to Shiraz is, according to Sykes, excellent, and the column is safe for the present in the vicinity of Shiraz, though the position is serious. He considers two Brigades will be needed if the Bushire force is used. He thinks it would be useful to capture and hold Borasjun, hut deprecates a mere demonstration The above is concurred in by the Consul and the Minister at Tehran endorses the suggestion that a demonstration should be made from Bushire at any rate. The spring will, the Minister at Tehran thinks, be a critical time owing to the migration of the Khamsieh and Kashgai tribes which will bring them near Shiraz. Sykes urges that a reinforcement of 600 men, to include 300 infantry, 4 maxims, 2 mountain guns and 100 sabres should be sent as he also is anxious on this point. This reinforcement which has been previously asked for is to escort, via. Sirjan and Nariz, mountain guns, instructors, arms, etc. Sykes thinks it is highly desirable for them to reach Shiraz by March. Soulet’s uncertain attitude still makes the situation complicated but he has been asked by letter to suppress the Kazerun rising, and that he will be considered unfriendly should he not try to do so. If friendly the situation will clear of itself. If we are to be kept clear of further commitments which might require the despatch of a large force and should Soulet prove hostile, we may have to withdraw from Shiraz. 31 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 180, dated the 5th January 1917.)

Dated 21st Safar [ = 17th (received 20th) December 1916]. From— Agha Muhammad Quli, Telegraph Ghulam, Borasjun, To—H. G. Chick, Esq , Vice-Consul, Bushire. Nasr Diwan, Kalantar of Kazerun, has sold all the barley and wheat he had, and removed his household effects, like a man w r ho has no hope. Muhammad Khan Kashkuli (Hujabr) and Muhammad Ali Khan Kashkuli have made peace with each other, it is said, and are now both at Shahpur. The news from Kumarij is that Quli Khan, Muntasir Diwan, with Kar bala! Abbas, are both at the caravanserai, which they bad seized, and the Nuhis are with them. Some of the Kumarijis are secretly with them too. I think Quli Khan’s affairs and those of Karbalai Abbas are prospering daily. The news from Khisht is that Nur Muhammad Khan and Sardar Khan had been for some days trying to make peace with each other, on the basis that the wife of Mulla Ali Wais, now in the hands or Nur Muhammad Khan, should be given back, and exchanged for Karbalai Abbas of Daliki, now in the hands of the Khishtis. Sardar Khan (and ?) Mullah Ali Wais were ready to give back Karbalai Abbas but Nur Muhammad Khan said that Amir Quli, son (of ?) the Kalantar of Kumarij, in the hands of the Khishtis should also be given up. They did not agree, and things between them are in the same state as before. As regards the alliance between the Khans, up till now they are apparently allied, but they tell each other lies, and from then till now they have constantly talked of stopping any men who came down from Shiraz. But nothing has happened. To a certain extent, they have lost that self-confidence which they had before.On the 19th of this month (15th December) Nasr Diwan sent a Qasid here with letters for Nur Muhammad Khan, Ghazanfar Saltaneh, Shaikh Hussain and Zair Khidar, stating that the Governor of Kazerun and the sowars and Gendarme were daily finding fault with him. He says that according to the treaty between himself and them, he has not yet submitted. If they still hold to their treaty, they must assist him as far as they are able. Up till now they have not replied to him, and his Qasid is still at Borasjun. Although Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh has asked Ali Akhbar Khan, the employe of H. K. H. the Governor-General, to put his affairs right (i.e., with Earman arma), and has promised him 2,000 tomaos, and gave him one mule and 50 tomans cash, and has taken a horse from Soulet Lashkar (Hussain Beg of Danki), and given it to Ali Akhbar Khan, and promised him 500 tomans and a mule if he will arrange matters (i.e., with Earman Earma) for Agha Khan of Shabankareh, he (Ghazanfar) is still writing to the Khans (presumably the other hostile Khans), and instigating them, and has not ceased his former practices He still keeps attached the loads belonging to the telegraphs, consisting of boxes and tents, etc., and Ghazanfar will not give permission for it to be moved. Translation of “ mda-i-Haq” No. 20, dated 22nd Safar 1335 (=18th Decem ber 1916). Pamphlet issued at Borasjun by “ Eslah ” (Muhammad Beza Dirisi, a bitter Anglophobe in pay of Wassmuss, allowed to live at Borasjun by the Khan). “Long live the Oommander of the Nation Zargham-i-Islam Nasir Diwan.” After the change in the situation in Shiraz, the domination of the un righteous and the entry of the English, it became known to all that the allied Khans of Islam continued to maintain their solemn intentions of defending their country, and did not allow the contagion of the influence of the enemies of the motherland to spread in their territories. Although they were evidently in a beleagured state, they held in check the forces of the enemy from both sides, and in spite of the internal difficulties with which they had' to contend, they did their best to establish order on the road , and performed the services entrusted to them, and afforded facilities to the travellers and for the transport of the merchandise, in order that the enemies may have no longer any excuse and that the country may be saved from their high-handedness and destruction. Unfortunately it appears that they were not satisfied with the destruction of Shiraz and the unbounded tyrannies in that place, and intended sending an expedition to these parts. The Islam loving Khans (Their Excellencies Mirza Muhammad Khan of Borasjun, Shaikh Hussain Chahkutaki, Zair Khidhar Tangistani and Nur Muhammad Daliki), and Nasir Diwan which means Nasir- i-Islam (Helper of Islam), became fully aware of this unfortunate state of affairs, made a new treaty and swore on the Quran to the effect that as long as they have life in them, they should not accept the present infidel-tainted arrangements proposed, and would get ready to sacrifice themselves with the force with which they were furnished by God Almighty for to-day. Accordingly, as the evil intentions of the enemies began to transpire from Shiraz, in accordance with the solemn treaty. Nasir Drwan, on the 20th Safar, which is the best day for good acts, proceeded to take steps and deprived the traitorous Salar-i-Nusrat of all powers as a Governor, with all due humiliation which such an unconstitutional Governor deserved, and imprisoned him. He captured the Gendarmerie Department which was established by English officers, disarmed the Gendarmes and cleared Kazerun from the stain of the infidels. The details of the events, according to what we have briefly heard at present, are that Kasir Diwan arrested the Governor in a public meeting after having verbally insulted him, and imprisoned him in chains. Thereafter he attacked the (Gendarmerie) Department which he besieged until dark, piercedthe walls on three sides at night and eatered it. The Gendarmes who are all at heart for Islam, and were unwilling to fight, at once offered to surrender and laid down their arms News received state that, in addition to rifles and two guns, large quanti ties of provisions which were lying in the Department fell into the hands of the Mujahidin. All around Kazerun, the town has been strengthened by several sangars and 300 reliable Tufangchis have been stationed in important positions from Pui-i-Abgineh to above It remains to be seen whether the people of Shiraz will keep quiet at this juncture and quietly acquiesce in this killing of Islam. It is now time for the great pontiffs of Shiraz to point out the duties of the Muhammandans to them (people of Shiraz), and to put an end to the wicked actions of the traitors of the country and their evil intentions. The result of the article, “ In what plight we are ? ” After the new treaty between the protectors of Islam, we published an article on the above subject. Whoever has seen that article will know, m view r of this great success at Kazerun and the presence of the “ natural M forces, how we are bringing the enemies to the end of their tether. “ 0 God, help u .” Shiraz is not a place for any non-Muhammadan. New r s from Abadeh and Ispahan. According to information which we have received, the Gendarmerie Department at Abadeh intended to arrest Muhammad Ali Khan, the Governor of Abadeh. He learnt their intentions, attacked them and killed some of them, while the remainder were besieged, Keinforcement has been sent from Shiraz. Still we cannot foresee any success for them in any affair at Shiraz, and if the news recently reported about the incident in Ispahan proves to be correct, our booties in this raid will be more than the last one. The news reported from Shiraz is that the Bakhtiaris have recaptured Ispahan and made Zil-us-Sultan a prisoner. Although this news has not reached us direct from Ispahan, but come from Shiraz, yet in view of the attacks which the “ Asr-i-Jadid ” said were being made on Ispahan by the Bakhtiaris, who had 58 casualties, they cannot have ceased their attacks. The news which says that Zil-us-Sultan sent 3 Bakhtiaris in chains to Tehran gives colour to the above report. The advent of His Excellency Nizam-us-Sulfcaneh. Lately we have re ceived two reports on the subject, one brought by the muleteers who have been to those parts and have seen the German Turkish force as far as Sultana- bad, Iraq, the other being fresh news communicated from Shiraz which says that a Cabinet of Ministers has been formed by His Excellency Mostowfi-ul- Mumalik It is evident that if this report is correct the advance in the north will have been pushed on to the Capital. The suppression of news should afford an inference to the patriots, who must not lose the opportunity and must pro ceed to cut short the hands of the enemies. Dated Borasjun, the 22nd Safar = 18th (received 20th) December 1916. From— Mirza Muhammad Khan, Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh, Borasjun, To —Ali Akbar Khan, Mamur of Farman Farma, Bushire. The day before yesterday I sent you a reply by your own sowar; no doubt it has reached you by now. Now, as Meshedi Hussain Mujahid is leaving to see you, I beg to trouble you with the following :— (1) As regards the shot-cartridges, I have sent Muhammad Hussain Khan to Daliki. Hujabr Nizam (Nur Muhammad Beg) replies that he has no information about them, and swears that he has no knowledge of them. rHe has also writteu a reply to you, and sent it; I have handed it oyer separately to Meshedi Hussain. W As regards my deposit, which they (the British) have attached in the Bank at Bushire, contrary to the laws of the whole world, you wrote that they will give me back my money. I was much obliged for your efforts in this matter. ! lad writte ^ Aliat 1 should give a guarantee that I would not molest juntisn subjects, so that they might send a signaller and repair the line. I have never molested the signaller, and will not do so, and especially I was unwilling that Mr. Simon, who was on very friendly terms with me should leaie Borasjun, and the Government telegraph house and line get out of order with U H , a 1 b&amp;eD f 1 e - * said f durin £ the cours e of my discussions last year witn toe British authorities, and assured them. As regards protection of merchandise, it is clear to foreign and Persian merchants that I do not do so, in order to please anyone. Bather, my honour does not permit that I should not protect merchandise, which is like a deposit m trust, m my district, or that I should betray my trust. Whenever they (the British) agree to release my deposit from attachment so that 1 may be reassured, the arrangement should be effected as follows • ^ lth interest should be handed over to Haji Muhammad Beqir Behbeham, fur him to acknowledge its receipt to Haji Ghulam Ali Behbehani and the latter to inform me by post of its receipt so that I may send the remainder of the documents, which I have received from the Bank, to Shiraz to Haji Ghulam Ali, and obtain my money from the latter. Further they (the British) should hand me written assurances, signed by H. B. H. (Farman Farma) and His Excellency Darya Begi, and Major Trevor, the Deputy Political Besident, and the Bussian Consul, that they will on no account cherish any evil intentions against, or inflict any punishment or loss on myself, my friends, my dependants. You also should give every kind of assurance, in view of that insight into my affairs that you possess, and the trust that I repose in you that &lt;c Inshallah,” I shall not act contrary to that agreement. I agree to any arrangement you make according to this above representation of mine. But as to your suggestion that I should send Major Trevor a short friendly letter, my neighbours (i.e., H. K. and Shabankareh) have spread certain rumours which preclude my writing and in view of their adherence to the British Government it is impossible to construe these rumours as being spread without the knowledge of the British. If these rumours are proved false, and a favourable reply is received from you, and a friendly arrangement is reached, of course communications must take place constantly (i e., betw een Ghazanfar and the British authorities) at first through you, and later as circumstances permit. You will hear what else I have to say from Meshedi Hussain, since Meshedi Hussain is intelligent. 34 Telegram P., No. 3-C., dated the 6th (received 7th) January 1917.

Minister for Foreign Affairs in a telegram, of which Karguzar has sent me copy, says that American Minister has informed him that Husseinoff—a would-be assassin—has been imprisoned in Kerman, and has asked for parti culars. Is it that Husseinoff is regarded as American protege in consequence of representing a company of which one member is Kazan of New York, I believe ? It would he well to know what objects American Legation has in view, and what are grounds on which it is interesting itself in the matter. I have in the past applied (?) after many American interests here appa rently without incurring either gratitude or resentment in this connection (?). They should let you know, I think, when they want to handle independently Kerman affairs.

After reading copies of the statements of Lance Naicks Abbas Khan and Mir Zaman taken by 2nd-Lieutenant Freemantle at Robat on 15th April 1916, I entirely withdraw the remarks I made regarding these two men in my No. 81, dated 26th April, as it is quite possible that their explanations are true ; in which case they would not be to blame. Mir Zaman is quite wrong as regards the times he gives, but this does not affect the case. Abbas Khan is also slightly wrong as regards the sequence of events, but I am ready to accept his statement. As regards the other men I am still of the opinion expressed in my No. 81, dated 26th April, i.e , that, though they did run away, that allowances should be made for the unusual and disadvantageous position in which they were placed in having no old soldiers round them. 89 {Received with Army Department Memorandum No. 14063, dated the 2nd December 1916.)

If Roever has given assistance in unravelling affairs of bank it was he who tangled them up as he was “ Bank Manager” in German-democrat regime at Shiraz. ° I think he and his wife and family should be sent to India for detention with others.

We are threatened with serious disturbances. I am doing my best to purchase, but wheat is very scarce everywhere. I strongly urge that 1,000 tons of wheat be sent from India at earliest opportunity. This amount is actually needed to carry on till next harvest. Cost of purchase and transport to Shiraz might be borne by Government of India and I would sell the grain here. I calculate cost price of Karachi wheat per “ man” of 6J pounds landed here would amount to at present rates of transport about 5 or 6 krans while bread now costs 4 - 6 krans. There would probably be a net loss to Government of about 70 tomans* per ton.

Governor-General is inclined to think in present circumstances our best course is to treat Soulet in friendly manner as long as he behaves properly. I agree with this view for reasons that Soulet can assist us in provi sioning town, and if friendly he is good card in our hands for keeping road open, opposing hostile Khans and checkmating Wassmuss. Earman Earma is therefore taking necessary steps, which I hope will prove successful.

Usual intrigues to upset Cabinet are going on and Prime Minister is nervous lest by taking any overt step in execution of August agreement he will give his opponents inside and outside of Cabinet excuse to redouble their attacks. He has now promised to find some formula to convey necessary instructions to Earman Earma, but meanwhile I think you should be careful to act as if position was already regularized, e.g., that all appointments or promotions of Persian officers should be made by Earman Earma very much as is done in the case of Cossack brigade where all appoint ments, etc , are officially made by Minister of War.

In present circumstances I venture to suggest for consideration that I be empowered to offer him this sum if he will prove his words by deliver ing Wassmuss to us, and in addition to giving him his 4^,000 tomans (if that is really sum due to him) promise the advertised reward, of which I do not know amount.

Since my arrival he has been sending friendly messages and promises. I propose asking him to come and see Sykes and myself and we will try and come to friendly understanding. Lately he has been dead against Mahomet Ali Khan Kashkuli but fighting has ceased for the present. Parman Parma is anxious to remove him from Ilkhaniship but to take his time over it. If he is to be removed finally 1 see no one who can take his place—certainly not one of brothers, one of whom is an invalid and other foolish. It may be to our interest to keep him strong enough to keep his tribesmen in subjection, provided always that central power in Pars is strong enough to cope with him if he rebels. This it is not at present assumed. South Persia Rifles should be able to do the necessary, and meanwhile Sykes* column (though not strong enough for offensive purposes against powerful tribesmen) is ample to defend itself should Soulet try another coup d'etat. 46 \ i No. 1323-W., dated Karachi, the 21st November 1916 ; .

Agreement entered into by the Yar Muhammadsai Damani Sardar and motabirs at Khwash, November 4th, 1916. 1. We, Mirs Jahind, Shah Sowar and Nur Muhammad, as Sardar and re presentatives of the Yar Muhammadzai Damanis, being repentant of our evil deeds committed against the High British and Persian Governments, humbly crave for pardon and sue for peace. 2. We promise that we and our tribesmen will refrain from raiding, loot ing and robbing in British and Persian territory for ever, and that we will not allow evilly disposed persons of other tribes to pass through our country either when going on raids or returning therefrom, or to take asylum in our country. 3. We undertake to deliver to the British Government 100 rifles from the whole tribe of Yar Muhammadzais in addition to those already taken by the British as a fine, and to restore, as soon as we are able to recover them from the persons in whose possession they now are, the five Government rifles taken by us. 4. We undertake to go to Paskuh with our families and dependents and remain there under the protection and orders of Mir Ghulam Kasul, to whom we have given full authority to act for us, until all the conditions of this agreement have been fulfilled. 5. Por each family of Yar Muhammadzais that desire to return to its country before the completion of the terms of this agreement, one rifle shall be given to the British Representative in Khwash, the rifle thus given by families to be deducted from the tale (total ?) of 100 rifles. 6. We further promise that there shall be no enmity between us and the Rekis and Kurds on account of any assistance these two tribes may have given to the British Government. Seal of Mir Jihand.

In this telegram I stated amount actually paid to Kawam was £42 218 up to that date. On August 16th £5,000 referred to in last paragraph was paid m. This leaves balance of £2,782 only. My telegram No. gives details of amounts paid. The above-mentioned amount of £2,782 could be paid into Imperial Bank of Persia at once for transmission to Shiraz. This would, however, only give about 10,000 tomans at present rate of exchange. Am I authorised to pay balance of about 121,800 tomans also ? 56 Telegram R., No. 170-F., dated (and received) the 26th November 1916.

Kawam’s expenses in connection with his father’s and his own move against revolutionaries in Shiraz. Please see Bushire telegram 2239, November 20th. Sums mentioned by him are all included in accounts given to me, but of £5,000 paid in May equivalent tomans 20,500, only tomans 500 were retained by himself and 20,000 was paid to Patel Mulk in whose account same amount is credited. Your telegram No. 132. i trust that the £5,000 you mention may be paid immediately. My telegram No. 158. For payment of balance of tomans 131,800 due to Kawam I suggest we take over his debt to Imperial Bank of Persia of tomans 45,000, payment of tomans 40,000 to Maliat (on account of portion of Kawam’s arrears of revenue) and pay him cash tomans 47,000 which will include £5,000 mentioned in your telegram No. 132. Of this tomans 47,000 we can give Hawalehs on Bank for about tomans 15,000 at 3 months date which the Kawam has to pay to various creditors, balance in coin. It is very urgent that ready money at least should be paid without delay as the Kawam cannot start on his expedition referred to in my telegram No. 158-F., and it is most important that this should not be delayed.m,-cm IIMUFIIT limn 10 Telegram R., No. 171-F., dated (and received) the 26th November 1916.

He hopes to he able to collect Maliat of rebel districts which will repay whole expedition. My immediately precedine telegram. I have recommended that tomans 32,000 cash be paid to him immediately, but it is possible (and probable) he will want up to another tomans 50,000 to carry expedition through with success. In view of great importance to us of object of expedition being attained I would suggest that this sum of tomans 50,000 be placed at my disposal to be held in reserve to meet his demands. Whole would be treated as an advance recoverable at the conclusion of his campaign. I would send an accountant with him to see money was properly spent. 58 Telegram R., No. 172-F., dated (and received) the 26th November 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. (Addressed Tehran ; repeated Cox and Bushire.) Kindly send me instructions regarding the treatment of Ttoever and as to the disposal of his property His wife and 2 children are living in his house in town. He possesses a good deal of property here and at Kazerun. He has been (and I hope will continue to be) of great assistance in un ravelling affairs of Imperial Bank of Persia and has placed no obstacles in way of Manager of Bank or myself. Remaining prisoners have threatened to denounce him in Germany for having traffic with enemy (ourselves). I would suggest as soon as remainder of Germans, etc., has been disposed of, Roever should be given liberty on parole and allowed to remain in his house under surveillance. His business is ruined and he does not intend to continue business in Persia on conclusion of war. I am convinced he will not leave his family if released on parole. 59 Telegram P., No. 719, dated the 26th (received 27th) November 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. (Addressed Foreign Office, London, sent to Petrograd.) My telegram immediately preceding. Eight points on which Persian Government would like to receive assurances from two Governments so as to render recognition and execution of August agreement more palatable to public, have been communicated un-officially by the Prime Minister:— (1) Substitution of officers of third power for British officers in South Persia Rifles and Russian officers in Cossack Brigade after war. (2) Monthly moratorium instalments to be tomans 200,000 not £30,000.

(4) Withdrawal of all foreign troops after war. (5) Engagement on the part of Russia and England to abstain from acts of interference in domestic affairs, e.g , agreements with tribal chiefs, giving protection to Persian subjects, etc. (6) Engagement on the part of Russia and England not to conclude any convention in future between themselves or with other powers whether friendly or enemy which would infringe Persian independence or would aim at annexation or provisional occupation of Persian territory or would give ground for com pensation and to oppose similar design on the part of other powers. (7) Persia to have representatives at peace conference with merely deliberative power. (8) Non-indemnification of British subjects for losses suffered in Persia during war. Persian Government admit we cannot concede (1). They would be satisfied with affirmative reply qualified by some condition of which the fulfil ment would depend on ourselves, eg., that neutral officers must be selected by common agreement between three Powers. With regard to (2) Persian Government point out that sterling sum when fixed was intended to represent tomans 200,000 approximately whereas owing to fall in exchange it now produces less than tomans 90,000 which even with contemplated subsidy is not sufficient for expenses of administration. It will moreover eventually be repaid. It two Governments agree to their request any rise in exchange at moment of repayment entails a corresponding loss to them. Assent might, however, be given if repayment is made in sterling. (3) We verbally intimated our readiness to agree last spring. (4) Russian Minister thinks that Russia would agree to give a favourable reply with the reservation that state of security of country and Persia’s power to maintain order permit it. (5) Verbal assurances have already been given by Russian Minister with qualification that existing grants of protection and agreements are to stand unless interested Persian party agrees to cancellation. His Majesty’s Govern- ent will presumably give a similar assurance. (6) As far as we ourselves are concerned this is covered by 1907 Convention. As regards other Powers we might promise our good offices. I have informed Prime Minister that I think neither (7) and (8) can be entertained# As Prime Minister is anxious to have an early un-official intimation of nature of our reply I should be glad to know whether I am authorised to reply in consultation with Russian Minister in the sense indicated as regards points (4) to (8) and what answer should be made on others. 60 Telegram R. ; No. 1087-C., dated (and received) the 28th November 1916.

We can rely on Barman Parma to exercise great prudence and Sykes of course fully recognises the necessity for avoiding fiasco It is manifestly to our advantage that opening of road and restoration of authority should be achieved thus rather than by a policy savouring of weakness.

From— Captain E. Nobl, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, To— Sir Charles Marling, K.C.M.G., C.B., &amp;c., &amp;c., His Britannic Majesty'* Minister and Envoy Extraordinary, Tehran. I have the honour to address you on the subject of Bakhtiari-Eussian relations and the necessity of our taking some steps to control them. The Russians have now occupied Ispahan for some nine months, but so far their effective jurisdiction extends to within but a few miles of the town. The remainder of the 60 odd miles of Ispahan territory up to the Bakhtiari border, is controlled by bands of brigands. It may be looked on as a neutral sphere dividing Russians and Bakhtiaris, but into which both parties occasion ally penetrate. In this area collisions have at times occurred between Russian troops and Bakhtiaris, but on the whole it may be said that that the existence of this *one has prevented friction arising between the two parties. This state of affairs cannot, however, continue indefinitely. The Russians are at present busy raising a force of Persian Cossacks in Ispahan and in time they will be in a position to extend their control up to the Bakhtiari border. When this comes to pass there will inevitably arise a crop of incidents such as the escape of malefactors and political suspects into Bakhtiari territory, boundary disputes, claims against Bakhtiaris, &amp;c., &amp;c. As a case in point I would mention that of Dr. Assadullah, a physician to the Bakhtiari Khans. This individual is wanted by the Russian authorities, Ispahan, who have announced their intention of hanging him if he should fall into their hands. I feel sure that under present circumstances it would not be possible to persu ade the Khans to hand him over. It would be folly to expect that with the present mutual attitude of suspicion and ill-feeling between the two parties similar incidents likely to arise in the future, will be settled without a dangerous amount of friction. Even if Russian-Bakhtiari relations become normal, we shall still be confronted with the fact that a powerful, well organised administration is in contact with a weak and ill organised one. Under these circumstances it would seem inevitable that the Russians will be forced to interfere sooner or later in Bakhtiari country. In my previous despatches* and telegrams I have indicated four measures • Vide Serial Nor. 308 «nd 35S in Part IX; also which, in my Opinion, WOllld tend tO Serial No. 25 current and letter ou pages 22 and 23 remedy this state of affairs. I will of nole8- again enumerate them in what I consider their order of relative importance. (1) Posting a small regular force in Chahar Mahal. (This would seem only necessary as long as Turks remain in Persia or until measure No. (2), referred to in the next paragraph, begins to materialize.) (2) Formation of a Bakhtiari police force under British officers. (11) Strengthening hands of Illkhani and Ulbegi so as to enable them to deal with Bakhtiari internal situation. (4) Effecting a formal reconsiliation between the Zill-es-Sultan and the Bakhtiari Khans. At one time it seemed to me that the adoption of course (3) might prove t Serial No. 3(3 in p.rt ix. sufficient, but since my recent,t risit to Ispahan, and my conversations with Russian authorities there, I see little hopes of the Bakhtiaris themselves being able to work out their own salvation. The Russians have suspicions that we are shielding the Bnkhtiari Khans for the furtherance of our own political ends and our support of men like Amir Mujahid, against whom the Russians have definite evidence, certainly lends colour to those suspicions. Sirdar Muhta- sham, though loyal to us, ready to do what he is told and from our point of view probably the best man at present in Bakhtiari for the post of Illkhani, is nevertheless not a strong man. It must also be remembered that in view of the strong anti-Russian and anti-Zill-es-Sultan feeling that exists, it is \ \85 impr°bal )le that any two Bakhtiari Khans would be prepared to take sufficiently energetic action to satisfy the Russian authorities. 7 I would strongly urge that we take immediate steps to raise a Bakhtiari police force so that when the Persian Cossack Brigade; now being formed by B«\htiflri a h S f Is P ahai1 ’ ta ^ es ® ha P e and is ready to extend control up to the on out 8ide b0^de^, WG Sha11 S S ° b6 Ieady t0 link Up With a similar organization While the body m question is being formed, it would seem very desirable to mamtam a small regular force in Chahar Mahal as a backing. This force could, I think, be cut down as low as two squadrons of Indian cavalry with two maxims, provided there are no Turkish troops in Persia. In a further despatch I will put forward definite proposals for the financing and organisation of the proposed Bakhtiari police corps.

Minister With reference to my despatch,* dated September 27th, on the subject of • Enclosure No. 1. the formation of a Bakhtiari police , , 11 „ force » 1 have now the honour to lay before you the detailed proposals referred to therein. J strength and composition of force —The ultimate strength of the force should be about 600 infantry and cavalry in the proportion of 2 to 1 . For the present it will be sufficient to form a nucleus of 200 infantry and 100 iowars. J Location.—Fh™, at first, should certainly be in Chahar Mahal as the chief object of the force will be to provide an organization to work in co-operation with the Russians. Deh Kurd, the administrative centre of Chahar Mahal would seem to provide a suitable Headquarters for the force. * Establishment for training.—Fho services of at least three British officers would be necessary, i.e. 9 Commandant, Adjutant and Quarter-Master. Several of the younger generation of the Khans have spent two or three years in the Officers* Training Corps at home. It would certainly seem advisable to make use of their services. Pay. —Infantry 8 to 10 tomans a month (to be armed by us). Cavalry 12 to 14 tomans a month (to find their own horses hut to be armed by us and their horses to be fed by us). Financing of force. —This should be done partly by the Khans and partly by the Persian Government or ourselves. The method I would suggest would be for us to agree to an increase of the tolls on the Lynch road in return for which the Khans would guarantee a contribution towards the expenses of the force. An increase of the tolls from krans 5, the present rate, to krans 8 should have practically no adverse influence on British trade as the increase of krans 3 would but represent 1 ^ of the present rates of mule hire from Ahwaz to Ispahan, and would probably be paid for by the muleteers. More over, in return for our sanction to this increase, the Khans, in addition to contributing towards the expenses of the force, would, I think, also be prepared to grant us a control of the tolls and the Lynch road in general, which if properly exercised, would have the effect of greatly assisting British trade* by bringing down transport rates very considerably. If it is not considered feasible during the duration of the war to undertake the control indicated, wei ■ Vi;, ' ! ■ y i s i * i 1 86 mielit content ourselves with obtaining the consent of Khans to the arrange*- ment proposed, and leave the question of giving effect to the concession open till we are in a position to undertake it effectively. This letter is being forwarded under flying seal to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, and a copy is being sent to the Chief Political Officer, Basrah. Enclosure No. 3. Dated Chighakhur, the 3rd October 1916. From—C aptain E. Noel, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, To—The Hon’ble Lieutbnant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Basrah. I herewith enclose you some correspondence regarding the Faraydun ■ituation. The matter in question is a further illustration of the danger referred to in my letter* of the 27tU • Enclosure No. i. of September. It is certain that the Russians intend taking over the administration of Paraydun when they feel themselves strong enough to do so. I feel convinced that the process will be accompanied by friction and the occurrence of many incidents calculated to give the Russians ample pretext for interference in Chahar Mahal itself. The Southern half of Earaydun is so Bakhtiari in character and so closely connected with Chahar Mahal that if the Russians were installed there, they would probably discover the need of a Consular representative m Chahar Mahal itself. It would seem to me of the utmost importance that m fixing the Russian and British spheres of influence we should press for the inclusion in our sphere of all Bakhtiari elements. The country to the north-west of Earaydun is unknown to me, but I believe there are Ilyat {i.e., tribes) there of Bakhtiari origin who extend into the present Russian sphere. Sub-Enclosure No. 1. Dated Ispahan, the 27th August 1916. From—G. Grahame, Esq., His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, To—C aptain E. Noel, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz. I have the honour to inform you that His Royal Highness Yamin-us- Sultaneh, Governor-General of Ispahan, has again made complaints to me, similar to those which he made at the time when the Bakhtiaris began to levy payment of the grazing tax in Earaydun and substituting themselves for the Ispahan authorities in that district. In proof of this contention His Royal Highness produced a letter in original (copy of which I enclose), purporting to have been addressed by Elias Khan, Sarum-ul-Mulk, to Haji Haider Quli and Haji Ismail, Yanchashmehi, calling on them to deliver up to Agha Bahram (a mamour sent by Elias Khan) a certain roan horse under a threat of tomans 500 (five hundred) in case of recalcitrance. His Royal Highness, in conversation on the subject with me this morning, said that this instance was only one out of many of Bakhtiari intervention in Earaydun, but that he had been unable so far to get documentary evidence as to the others. I would request you to be good enough to take such steps as you may see fit in this matter and inform me at your convenience of the result—if any—» for the satisfaction of the Governor-General of Ispahan.1 €7 sub-Enclosure No, 2. Dated Junaghua, the 3rd September 1916. From— Captain E. Neol, His Majesty's Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, To— G. Graham^ Esq., His Majesty's Consul-General, Ispahan. I have thought it advisable to write to you demi-officially in regard to the matter dealt with in your despatch* • Sab-Enciosure *o. 1. ^ 16j before addressing you officially on the subject. The Bakhtiaris frankly acknowledge that they interfere in Earaydun, but *ye quite ready to stop doing so if we tell them. As luck would have it, I met the other day Ahmed Quli Khan and his brother Muazam-ul-Mulk, who are the leaders of the “ Eouj-i-Earaydun They tell me that they held the Deputy Governorship of Earaydun for four rears under the Zill-es-Sultan when they used, as a matter of course, to refer all disputes on the Earaydun border to the Khans for settlement. They tell me that this state of affairs has now crystalized from long custom so that it represents under present conditions the only possible modus vivendi. Moreover, they say that the Zill fully recognised this even in his own time. As an illustra tion they quote a recent incident when Mamours sent from both the Deputy Governor and from Ispahan were unable to effect the release of Haji Mohomed Hassan of Siftgun who had been seized by Quli Khan Tukhm-i-Abui. Einally, in despair the Earaydun authorities, although both the individuals concerned were Earaydunis, appealed to the Bakhtiari Khans who sent Mamous. ine latter had no difficulty in carrying out the duties entrusted to them. I have not had time as yet to make further enquiries, but quote the above to show that there would appear to be more in this matter than at first meets the eye. # . Guli Khan and Muazam, who are Earaydunis and not Bakhtiaris, assure me that if the Khans refuse their good offices, the whole of the Eraydun district will immediately relapse into the same state of anarchy that characterises the bulk of the Ispahan province. It would seem to me that in view of the noto rious incompetence of the Zill-es-Sultan’s Government to maintain even a pemblance of order, and the comparative security existing in Bakhtiari limits, it is hardly the time to ask the Bakhtiaris to withdraw from one of the few districts of Ispahan which is more or less quiet, when the Ispahan Govern ment have no machinery to replace that which they wish to get rid of. ^ Another point to b&amp; considered is that we are continually asking the Bakhtiaris to send escorts into Ispahan territory to do the work of the ^paban Government. I refer to escorts for British travellers and to my recent despatch of sowars to follow up the Germans. 1 hope to come into Ispahan some time this month when I can discuss ;this matter more fully with you. Sub’Enclosure No. 3. Copy of Ispahan telegram to Minister, No. 283, dated the 15th September 1916. Noel, who arrived here on the 14th of September, wishes to 4 isci } ss ^ me question of permitting loyal Bakhtiaris to gam a footing m Ispahan territory more particularly in the Earaydun district where they claim to hav exercised jurisdiction in the Zill-es-Sultan s time and seek to do so now. Noel is inclined to view such intervention favourably on the ground tha the Bakhtiaris can maintain order, whereas the Governor-General o spa a impotent. ,, I am at a disadvantage inasmuch as I have no information as o reasons for the recall of the Zill-es-Sultan whether ^ f'fJ ^nrotlct Russians, whether we are pledged to give him our full support and to protectIspahan territory from Bakhtiari encroachments or are prepared to close onr eyes to them or even encourage them. I should be glad of general enlightenment on the general trend of polior in Ispahan, and on the points abore mentioned in particular. 3 Grahame. ouo-enclosure JSo. 4.

Your 283.* Question of Zill-es-Sultan’s return to Ispahan just now is at present under discussion between London and Petrograd. I am strongly urging the view of the Persian Government that a neutral governor be appointed for a time in th^ hope that this may strengthen the Illkhani, but Eussian Legation and Petrograd, where since combat at Nejefabad, Bakhtiaris are all looked on as enemies without discrimination, will not agree “ to make a concession ** Although Zill-es-Sultan returned to Ispahan with a pledge of support from both powers, it is obvious that as all his interests are in Ispahan, he must sooner or later lean on Eussians rather than on us, but he or rather his nartv has gone much further and is now actively hostile. As it is thanks to their mtngue with Nimtaj that Soulet has ventured to take so strong a line against Farman Farma and Sykes’ Mission. In spite of this we cannofin any choZ. stances encourage the BakhUans against him and so produce an impression of conflict between Eussian and British policy. ^ P n or (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 13127, dated the 11th November 1916 i Telegram P., No. I.

From—The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. (Addressed Chief of the General Staff, Force f&lt; D/ 5 ) Just as a telegram communicating my own view to Army Commander was on the point of issuing I received copy of Army Commander’s telegram to India regarding escort of German prisoners to Bushire. My views were based on hypothesis that it might now be considered expedient to settle hinterland question and in case that view may be taken by Government it seems as well to let my telegram issue and I trust that Army Commander will approve of my having repeated to Eoreign Department. Telegram begins. On arrival at Bushire November 15th I saw correspondence ending with Deputy Chief Political Officer’s telegram 5862, November 11th, asking for my views regarding proposed escort of Shiraz prisoners to Bushire. Sykes’ telegram 952, November Idith, to Chief of the General Staff, India, and Eoreign suggesting that certain small reinforcements now under despatch to him should be sent by Bushire instead of via Ahwaz has also reached me. Both these Shiraz proposals ignore state (of) relation(s) existing between Persian and British Governments and Khans of Borasjun, Chahkuta and Tan- gistan. The following is the position :— (1) Vis-a-vis Persian Government. They are rebels and have been officially deposed from their posts. Eor years they have paid no revenue and they continue to write impertinent letters to Governor of Bushire. The pun ishment of these rebels was on the foremost condition in our announcement to the Persian Government in connection with occupation of Bushire on August 8th, 1915. It is still unfulfilled. Case of Daliki is practically the same as that of Borasjun with whom he is allied. (2) Vis-a-vis British Government. In our negotiations for release ©f O’Connor and party it was specifically ordered that we were to give Khans no sort of assurance of immunity from subsequent punishment at our hands and I understand attitude of Government to be that they have every intention of punishing them at the earliest convenient opportunity. Borasjun is now engaged in endeavouring to get Shief route closed against us; the other two are harbouring remainder of gang who murdered Residency Agent, Lingah, and his brothers. My opinion therefore is that if it is contemplated to send any British troops through the limits of these Khans to bring prisoners from Kazeroon, their districts must be treated as enemy territory and our force must be sufficient to deal with them at the same time. What precise strength is necessary is a military question but having regard to large numbers of machine guns with General Officer Commanding, Bushire, three battalions should suffice. I suggest, however, that two or four mountain guns would be desirable in addition. Such a force should be well able to deal with hostile Khans and keep road open up to Daliki. Section between Daliki and Kazeroon depends on Soulet’s attitude at the moment and also of Kashkulis ; with strong posts at 1 Iff! 'll i ii4 v Daliki, Ralidar and Kazeroon and political energy of Farman Farma I should anticipate little difficulty however. According to latest information Chahkuta and Tangistan could not put up more than 600 men between them and Boras- jun 800 at the outside. If slight reinforcements which military opinion considers requisite can be provided from any quarter I would strongly recom mend present occasion be taken to settle hinterland question and open road simultaneously. It will have most salutary effect on general situation in whole of Fars. The condition of affairs will remain eminently unsatisfactory until it is done. If, however, project not considered expedient at the moment that Governor- General with Sykes’ assistance should retain prisoners until action can be taken on above lines, or until they can be deported safely by another route. 11 No. 13187, dated Simla, the 13th November 1916 (Confidential).

It is stated in a report from Sultanabad that Turkish ammunition stocks at Hamadan are not plentiful. Turks at Hamadan are preparing for the winter and are erecting grain warehouses. Turkish hospital orderly from Kermanshah reports at A li-al-Gharbi that at Kermanshah there are 1,500 sick in hospitals and that this number, probably due to the severe cold at Hamadan, is in creasing.

Noel would welcome removal of Ilbegi Amir Mujahid and Murtaza Qulli Khan. 140 mules which were collected by Noel for purpose of carrying grain to Shiraz have recently been seized and discharged by retainers of these two Khans.

According to telegram 309 from Sykes, dated July 2nd, Bahram Khan had written about fort built at Khwash and I have heard similar story since. I advised Sirdar to reply that, though nothing was known here of any such fort, the British had probably fortified and built huts in their hot-weather camp and that enquiries would be made.

It is, however, likely to aggravate procession of Bakhtiari percolation to Turks which is tending to set in and in event of further adverse developments of Bakhtiari situation vis-a-vis Russians and Zil«es-Sultan it is difficult to foresee what its effect would be. Mohtashim is continually reverting to question of assistance against Kuhgelus and if there is any possibility of such assistance being afforded, this might offer pretext for move. I may again repeat that feeling here is chiefly anti-Russian and anti-Zil- f es-Sultan and although an open breach with Russians might eventually make itself felt in low country we could nevertheless count upon receiving very ‘ ample warning before it did so.

It is almost impossible to foresee what the tribesmen are likelv to do in any given circumstances, but I am inclined to think that they would attaet any force going up road unless it were a fairly strong one. A force strong enough to retaliate if attacked might prevent tribesmen from attacking required force would of course be provided (?) by military authorities and also points to which it could proceed. I think that it would be a mistake in send any small detachment. On the other hand, transport difficulty would probably preclude move of large force on Daliki-Kazerun Section so that nroh ably large force would only be able to go as far as Daliki. A portion of it could perhaps go on to Kazerun if attitude of Kashgais satisfactory. !t is doubtful that move of a force up the road would be useful in openimr the road, but to have proper effect I think it would be necessary to keen somf portion of force at Daliki and Borasjun until Sykes is in position to take over care or road.180 Telegram R., No. 140-F., dated the 6th (received 7th) November 1016.

I I have the honour to invite a reference to the concluding paragraph of my letter No. 257'C., dated 10th July 1916, regarding the murder of Khan Bahadur Agha Badr, Residency Agent, and his brothers at Lingah. On the 13th October, His Excellency the Darya Begi concluded the trial of the 11 prisoners whom he had arrested in Liugah last April, and whoso sentence had been postponed until the release of the Shiraz prisoners.ir, Hi B E l XC r 1, ? e { C “ Ticted t 7° of haTin e participated in the murder of the Khan Bahadur s brothers and sentenced them to death. Two others he •eutenced to two years’ rigorous imprisonment from the date of award for being accessories before the fact. The seven remaining prisoners, His Excel- !iaT r^V'T 1 ° ne year S rl ® orou3 imprisonment from the date of arrest (10th April) for being accessories in a lesser degree. . The . 8 ^ me . ev ening His Excellency sailed for Lingah in the “ Persepolis ” takmg with him the two convicted murderers, Muhammad bin Ali, and^ Haii hm xs ad Ah. Inese two persons were hanged outside the fort at Lingah at 9 A. M., on the 17th instant, in the presence of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and a number of the principal people of Lingah. . ■^ s remf dning nine prisoners were sentenced to imprisonment for a crime against the British Agent and it was, therefore, desirable to ensure the sentence being carried out, and as prisoners in Persian jails have a trick of escaping, I arranged with the Chief Political Officer, Basrah, that these prisoners should undergo their imprisonment at Basrah, and they have accord ingly been imprisoned there. His Excellency the Darya Begi returned from his trip to Lingah and other ports on the 25th instant, and I called on him on the 28th. In the course of the interview 1 asked him whether he could take anv steps to make Zair Khidar hand over Haji Ali and the other murderers who had taken refuge in Tangistan. His Excellency stated that until these Khans had been severely punished they would not dream of giving up these murderers, nor in fact would they do anything to help the Government. His Excellency constantly harps on the urgent necessity for punishing these Khans—with which view, I need hardly say, I am in cordial agreement—unfortunately His Excellency has no resources, and it does not seem likely that the Persian Government will be in a position to provide him with any for many a long day. There is no doubt, however, that, until these Khans are punished, the Governors of the Gulf Ports will be much hampered by their providing an Alsatia in their districts just outside Bushire tor all the dangerous characters in the neighbourhood. ) 186 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 12887, dated tbe 7th November 1916.)

But I can get no details out of him at all and I have told him that I object to paying without.

Your 84832 of October 12th. Keyes is now here and I have conferred with him. I concur with his view that negotiations should be carried on through Sirdars with Mission and that formal Durbar at this juncture is unnecessary and undesirable. I under stand that Government’s policy is to support Persian administration for the whole of Persian Baluchistan (by means of ?) Political officers with force of South Persian Rifles ; in this case Sarhad question must be considered as part of the whole question of Persian Baluchistan.I consider that for some time to come a small force of regular forces will he necessary to support detachment of South Persian Rifles in the Sarhad. Until Damani leaders have shown intention of observing terms of peace, posts in this district must be maintained. Levies already raised might be amalga mated with South Persian Rifles, Damani having been driven to take asylum in Baranzai sphere it is impossible to entirely separate their case from that of Bahrain Khan and therefore until latter’s case is settled it is impossible to make final detailed settlement. We should thus in settling terms on which Damani should be allowed to come in and sow crops merely inform them that Government intends to support Persian Government in maintenance of good order. Damani are surrendering rifles but Sirdars do not think these will produce hostages demanded. I believe, however, that leaders will allow their sons to accompany Keyes to Charbar under guarantee from Sardars with him. They can then before returning home be sent on educative tour to (Karachi?) and Quetta. Poverty of their cultivation and lack of market for pastoral produce is the chief cause of raiding propensity of Damani. Extension of railway will provide for the latter, but I think that an excellent effect would result from a promise to recommend to Government that advances should be made to enable them with our assistance to dig new Karezes and open old ones. Country has very great possibilities and they should settle . down and give up raiding habits if cultivation is extended. An early reply is desirable, if you approve of above principles, so that Keyes can 'proceed towards coast and regain communication with his supplies which owing to deficient transport cannot be arranged through Quetta.

Wassmuss was brought back to Abram some- days ago and is reported to be getting better. He is again in correspondence with Eakhr-us-Sultaneh, now at Kumarij, and has sent a messenger to him. Beports from other sources show that Fakhr-us-Sultaneh is contemplating flight north or north-west to Bakhtiari country (the neighbourhood of Paradumbeh seems likely). It is probable that Wassmuss means to join Pakhr-us-Sultaneh. I think it advisable to point out this probable line of retreat now open in case great importance is attached to preventing Wassmuss escaping to another part of Persia. If so, two courses appear to be open. , (1) To try and seize W r assmuss at Ahram by sudden cavalry raid before Wassmuss is fit to travel.

I did not know that I have any military status or that I am under orders of Officer Commanding, Sistan Field Force. Nor do I know anything about constitution of military court, and am ignorant whether civilians can sit on rthem. I beg, however, to point out that my Consular status makes me senior to all Lieutenant-Colonels, and I cannot, without specific orders from Foreign Department, sit below Dale. A ruling on these general questions is solicited. At the same time I would point out that there is another military officer available for the court, viz. t Captain Brenan. I submit that this innovation, if not objected to, will form precedent for interference with my Consular duties entailing possibilities of great incon venience hereafter. Work of a police nature is included in normal functions of a Consul, and I think that in advising military prosecutors I can be of more use than by sitting on courts.

Soulet said to be doubtful quantity. He left town with two guns before we arrived and we have heard nothing of him since. His two brothers have been to see me and also Farman Farma and are ready to take any action we may order them. Mahomet Ali Khan Kashkuli has communicated in same sense ; so if the Soulet played the fool we could arrange matters very easily. Kawam is quite for us and his attitude satisfactory. He proposes mov ing against Baharlus directly His Highness gives permission which I hope to arrange very soon. He shows no signs of getting rid of Mirza Mustapha, his Chief Adviser, and resents the proposal that he should be got rid of. I am assured the Mirza has had very bad influence over him, but I have not dis covered truth of it yet. Gendarmerie is fairly satisfactory, though there are some officers who are said to dislike idea of British intervention of (in ?) their affairs. One of these has been dismissed by Farman Farma and others will be disposed of in time. It is very difficult to find out details as to arrears due aud correct numbers of men present, &amp;c., but I am finding out gradually. A large proportion of money paid has gone into the pockets of certain officers, but Weldon is now making all payments to men personally. I am now paying for daily food of gendarmes until Sykes comes.57 Regarding scarcity. Some 'wheat has come in from South. I am informed Sonlet has a lot in his granaries and I have written to him asking if he will send some in. Farman Farma has sent four large carts to A. had eh to bring grain. Grain is to he had in South, but disorganisation of tribes makes it difficult to bring it in. I hope we will arrange martial law in time to reduce f price.

I have the honour to forward in case they may be of interest, copies of some letters written by certain Kashkuli Khans, showing their hostility to their Illkhani Soulet-ed-Douleh, and their desire (probably very shortlived) to join Haidar Khan and the Khans friendly to the British. /(Sub-enclosure No. 1.)

We are now at Shahpur and will remain here for some time to settle matters of business, and will then come to the Mahur (mountains) in your neighbourhood. Haji Muhammad Karim Khan has furnished you with details and reports regarding the Bakhtiari state of affairs, and there is no need of my writing anything to you. (Enclosure.) It became necessary to inform you of the state of affairs—■ Haji Muhammad Karim Khan has come to this side and will give you details of the situation. I may clearly tell you that Haji Muhammad Karim Khan has under taken a certain affair, and has become earnestly ready to accomplish it. I'his affair depends on what Haidar Khan and yourself consider expedient. \N. B. by H. G. 0 .—Haidar Khan told me these letters were put into his hands as he was leaving Bandar Big. The Kashkuli Khans mentioned (of Muhammad Ali Khan’s section) had sent message saying they were ready to join the Anglophile party and attack Shiraz 1 ] (Enclosure.) No one knows what the policy of Sardar Ashair is. I need merely say that sometimes he is pro-German. As soon as he learns that the English have succeeded, he will adopt their policy. Now-a-days he has relations with the Bussians. In short we do not know what his policy is. (Sub-enclosure No. 2.)

If you will write to me I will myself come to see you and we will discuss the matter verbally. Please’send any instructions which you deem expedient. (Sub-enclosure No. 3.) Ixtract from a letter from Eaji Muhammad Karim Khan, Kashkult (ex-Deputy of the Kashkai tribes in the Majlis), to Muhammad Khan Eayat Daudi, Chaharrustai, dated the 25th Zi- Qaadeh 1334 [=24th (received 30th) September 1916]. There is a rumour that the British troops haye arrived in Eudhilleh. Please inform me of the truth of this. Please let me know all about Basrah. I have no news from Tehran, except that it was mentioned two or three days ago that the Bakhtiaris had seized Ispahan.According to another rumour it was stated that the Russian troops had defeated the national forces. According to another report the forces of Nizam- us-Sultaneh were victorious. In short everyone is speaking according to his own inclination. {Enclosure.) I will give you an account of the past events. You are well aware that when the late Kawam-ul-Mulk returned from Bushire I went to see him. But the sad event of his death took place. When I arrived in Shiraz afterwards I saw that the attitude of Sardar Ashair had changed, and that he had quarrelled with all the Kashkai tribesmen. I sup ported the Kashkai Kalantars. Meanwhile Sardar Mutazid arrived at Shiraz v on behalf of H. H. Barman Earma, and afforded me every assistance and gave me all sorts of assurances. The Darashuri tribesmen asked the Bakhtiaris for assistance and support. A Bakhtiari and Darashuri force set out with certain intentions. Sardar Ashair was obliged to give in and had an interview with the Bakhtiaris, who turned back. Sardar Ashair then went to receive Barman Banna to Kumisheh. Apparently he did not treat Sardar Ashair properly. The Sardar came to Shiraz at once, and interviewed Kawam and they jointlv took the Deputy Governor into custody. They have forced the people of Shiraz to send harsh telegrams to Barman Barma saying that they did not agree to his being the Governor-General. As Barman Barma was at Dehbid, which is a miserable place, he returned to Abadeh. According to a certain report he has been waiting for troons and will return to Shiraz later. ^ At present the Arg or Government house is in the hands of Kawam and I Sardar Ashair. In order to be assured of each other’s alliance they have mariied a one-year old girl to a boy of two, so as to show the people of Shiraz that they have effected a matrimonial alliance. The Kashkai tribesmen have no confidence as yet, and in view of this I have not gone to my villages, and have this 3 ; ear come to this side of the mountains. {Enclosure.) the letter should be intercepted on the road, I have verbally instruct ed Kurban Dizkhani to give you the details of the situation. I am ready to serve you with the Kashkuli and even the whole of Kashkai forces. m (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 12090, dated the 24th October 1916.)

Marling, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, Tehran. I have the honour to forward, for your information, copies of certain letters which have been intercepted and sent to me for perusal. The letters from Shaikh Hussain and Zair Khidar throw an interesting light on their view of the situation. Soulet’s letter to the Shaikh of Mohammerah explaining his recent conduct is not very convincing. Mr. Zaytoon’s correspondent at Shiraz appears to be a shrewd observer, and to have made a correct forecast of events. It is interesting to note that on the 5th September he was sure that Wassmuss would go to K.umarij. and Mirza Ali showed to Mirza Muhammad Khan. (Sent by Hassan Khan, Tangis* tani). (Undated, but later than 16th September.) You have written nothing for the past 2 days. Confidential, Rais Muhammad, who is in Bushire has sent a number of secret reports for me to tell you, saying that the British state that they have not made peace, and that it is arranged that shortly 12,000 troops should be sent off to Shiraz. He says that if they say they will send them via Ahmadi, we should not agree, because their intention is to post a number of men at Ckogadak, Ahmadi and Borasjun. I you do not allow them passage, they will cross by the Shief route, Mirza Muhammad Khan is guilty in the eyes of the British Govern ment. In any way they can, they want to ruin him. Muhammad Ali Khan and Haidar Khan and Ahmad Khan have promised them to help them. Sardar (Khan) and Nur Muhammad (?) and AH Wais are their friends, and they are waiting for Farman Farma with a British General to reach Shiraz. They too (Khishti Khans) will despatch a force anyhow. It is a pretext that they have sent out officials to collect the Maliyat, and merely in order that they may have an excuse. ( 83 (Enclosure* Precis. Sub-Enclosure No. 1. Copy of a letter from Shaikh Hussain to Zair Khidhar, which the latter sent to Mirza Ali,Why is Mirza Muhammad Khan digging trenches, and then leaving them empty ?

The Darya Begi tells us lies, and is the servant of the British. Hassan Khan has gone to Bushire : I do not know whether he has gone of his own account, or the latter have sent for him. He is always going to the Besidency and Amirieh. Shaikh Said Nasuri (i e., the Shaikh of Kangun turned out after the bombardment) has come here for our mediation. We cannot mediate for him with the British or Darya Begi, and are obliged to write to Khalu Hussain and Zair Muhammad Haji Salim to take him to Shaikh Hatam. The people thought that we were the pupil of the eye of the British : they do not know that on account of the starvation of the tradespeople we have so- arranged that a road should be opened for the poor people to come and go. Although with the intentions which the British have it is unlikely that the road will remain open, yet should they say to us that they are going to march by Ahmadi and Borasjun, we will not submit. Then they will close the road. Dor some days past the transport of goods via Shief has been stopped, and the merchants do not send merchandise to Borasjun by the town gate road, as they say that Borasjun is in danger. This time that 30 camels brought goods, they were sent by Borasjuni merchants. Everywhere in Bushire it is rumoured that the British intend to seize Borasjun. Their sendiog officials (to collect Maliyat) is a pretext. You are in correspondence with Mirza Muhammad Khan. Although friendship and hostility in these times is very uncertain, yet to-day it is expedient. I also have several times exchanged messages written and verbal with him.

W ben I reached Borasjun he had gone to Muhammadabad. I went immediately to Muhammadabad to the house of llais Ghulam Ali. He asked me directly why I had gone to Bushire and blamed me: and said that as I had not listened to him, I must proceed to Chahkutah and ask pardon of Shaikh Hussain. I replied that even if I were to die for it yet I would do no such thing. He asked me what I was up to, saying that he could not consider me equal to the friendship of Shaikh Hussain Khan and Zair Khidar Khan. Although lie spoke very harshly and abusively to me, I replied by making the excuse that I had gone to Bushire to see my mother and brother, and that Haidar Khan died, and I had to be there for the mourning ceremonies. He then said that I must go to Bunneh, which is on the borders of Zirah. X did not agree to go to Bunneh, as it first of all has no house, and secondly is far away from Angali and Bushire. I was obliged to say that I would give a writing that I would neither go to Bushire, nor continue in correspondence with the liesidency. He replied that Shaikh Hussain Khan had complained to him of my being at Cbah Arabi, and whould probably kill me. I again said that I was ready to meet whatever Shaikh Hussain tried to do, and would not complain to him (Ghazanfar). At present the matter is standing over. As regards his friendship with Shaikh Hussain. After leaving Muham- madabad, Mirza Muhammad Khan v T ent shooting, and handed over all the letters he had with him to one of bis men to take back to Borasjun. As I was ill, I said that I wmuld go to Borasjun. Mirza Muhammad Khan replied “ very w T eli On the road I promised that man of his 5 tumans cash, and took all the letters he had, and copied them on my arrival at Borasjun, and then gave them back. The hour that I copied these three letters was like a whole year to me, as I was both unwell and very anxious that none should know. Mirza Ali, Kazeruni, is going to him morning and evening and consulting with him. According to what they say Wassmuss bad gone to fetch ammunition, A band met him on the road, and stabbed him several times. He also shot 2 men with his revolver. He is now at Pariab and a doctor is attending him. As regards (Ghazanfar’s) friendship with Shaikh Hussain, it seems that it is close. I will, I hope, send you further details later on. Hassan-Tangistani. The intermediary between Mirza Muhammad Khan and the other Khans is Mirza Ali. On the night of the 8th, Mirza Muhammad Khan met Agha Khan of Shabankareh at Ziarat, and they had a long conversation. It is probable that there will be hostilities with Shabankareh.

After my arrival at Shiraz, despite the disorder and disturbances in Pars and the scarcity of foodstuffs, the Government authorities called upon myself and His Excellency Kawam-ul-Mulk to restore order in the town and neighbourhood. We had no help but to carry out the order, and have, for some time, taken much trouble in restoring order and spent large sums money on troops for the restoration of order in the province.

They say Mr. Sykes has gone to Ispahan. They will repent of their tardiness m coming on to Shiraz. Soulet-ud-Douleh is not at all pleased that Barman Barma is Governor- General. According to a telegram he has interviewed His Highness and is going to return, in order to restore order on the roads. But it will be the contrary ; the Qawam-ul-Mulk is a boy and he will deceive the latter. He has bribed the Ulama and some great sedition will occur before Iona 1 * * * At present the town is not in good order and security, and the neighbour hood is very disturbed * * * I am at a loss to know what will happen, and what to write, as you have none here. The Germans and Austrians in confinement are sending money to every one, and making arrangements with everybody. I fear that your plans will be ruined. 1 11 i The men who are working for you here are Mirza Abdus Samad and Gerard, who have not got the ability of a turnip, and are simply makin' mischief, and setting the people against the British Government, °At tlie time I am writing this letter, T am at Dashtarjin with Muhammad Ali Khan and Muhammad Khan, Kasiikuli. Hussain, Tangistani, has brought a letter for them from Wassmuss. As I was there, he could do nothing and Zair Hussain returned: Muhammad Ali Khan and Muhammad Khan swore on the Kuran not to adopt a hostile attitude against the British Govern ment. They are on very bad terms with Soulet. They say Fakhr-us-Sultaneh has gone to Kumarij and is purchasing rifles and ammunition. Wassmuss will undoubtedly go there. The people of Khisht will no doubt surround him; the tower and fort at Kumarij is verv strong, and Nur Muhammad is assisting Kumarij. Without a gun and instructions the Khishtis will not be able to do anything. I am doing my best to win over the TJlama, but without presents I can not make much headway in this respect. Were you present in Shiraz you could do great services to your Govern ment with comparatively little expense. Even now if you would either send some one to Shiraz or a little money secretly, matters would be advanced considerably. As it is my duty, I report the events of the South to the Press in Tehran. I have sent reports four or five times, and they are all published. Haji Kawam Diwan, who was Director of Municipality, has been dismissed, and Saram-us-Sultan has been appointed in his place. Ata-ud-Douleh, who has rendered good services, has been dismissed from the post of Head of the Nazmiyeh: Masud-ud-Douleh has been appointed Director of the Police Department in his place. Zia-ul-Udeba, the Editor of Jam-i-Jam, and Muin-ul-Islam of Behbehan are still in confinement in Sahib Diwan’s garden. Banan-ush-Sharia, whom they had banished, is said to he in Kazarun, where he is making mischief. They say he has joined Eakhr-us-Sultaneh. Kawam-ul-Mulk has collected all his forces outside Shiraz intending to go to receive the Governor-General; hut it is doubtful if he will set out. It is time that the British Government should enter into an agreement with Soulet and Kawam, and conciliate the TJlama. It is early yet for them to begin punishing any one. « * * ******* They say that Mirza Abdus Samad and Gerard have secret intercourse with the Germans, and that a letter which Gerard has written in German has been intercepted. ****** Should Mr. Sykes wish to come to Shiraz he must first of all make arrangements for rations and have 10 men working hard for him, and bribe the Ulama. The Englishmen seem to know nothing of economy and zealous work. When necessary, they refuse to pay one thousand tumans j hut they spend 100000 thousand tumans without any apparent reason. * * * Sufi and Zia-ul-W^aizin are in confinement at Kawam’s house. The Germans have received money, and they are distributing it among certain of their friends. Haji Ali Agha and his son are still hiding some where, but receiving their expenses from a certain place. All the districts of Ears are without an owner and a Governor. The Gendarmes in Shiraz are all in debt. They received 50,000 tumans from the Government, but it has been spent. They still have 100,000 tumans arrears of salary. Yawar Eath-ui-Mulk, Sardar-i-Ashair and Kawam-ul-Mulk have taken an oath of alliance. The British Consul and Governor-General are very slow in coming, and $his tardiness on their part will give rise to great trouble. Little by little, a great disturbance will he caused. Owing to the incompetence of the Deputy-Governor, robbery takes place in the town at night * ? * * _The road as far as Kazernn is closed. Telegraph wires from Dashtarjin as far as the Dasht-i-Barm have been broken. Every week the mail coming to Shiraz is being robbed. Mirza Mahmud Shirazi. Sub-Enclosure No. 7. Copy of a letter from Agha Muhammad Kuli, Telegraph Ghulam, Borasjun, to H. G. Chick, Esq, C.I.E., Bushire, undated (received 26th September 1916). I beg to state that your letter to me was received, and I understood what you had written. As regards news of Wassmuss for which you had asked. Eive days ago he was at the Tang-i-Darkash, and left to go to Jamileh, and thence to Kumarij, he and Mirza Ali Afghani. A certain Yari of the Farsimadan ambushed him at Ab-i-Garmu, which is near Em Eariab (he and three other men with him) they suddently got up in front of him, and seized and captured him, so that they began struggling and wrestling, and they knifed about 10 times, so that he fell as if dead. They took away bis belongings, and cleared off. The news reached Mulla Haidar, Kadkhuda of E-u Eariab, who went and placed Wassmuss’ body on a bier, and brought it to Eu Fariab. Mulla Haidar wrote a letter to Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh- saying that the incident has occurred in this wise, and Wassmuss has been wounded. Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh sent off a surgeon and Mirza Muhammad Eeza (Dirisi) with two sowars to cure him. According to what they say his wounds are very serious. Besides the trenches which they had previously dug they have dug four trenches near Deh Nao up to 2,000 paces to the south of Deh Na’o. Now he has given orders (i.e., Ghazanfar) that they should dig 100 trenches to the south of the former trenches, each trench to hold one man or two men. Their limits extend to the borders of the road of Chah-i-Khani to Shief. Nur Muhammad Khan and Haidar Ali Khan (Kashkuli: brother of Muhammad Ali Khan) and Zulfikar Khan, Kalantar of the Farsimadan Kash qais, have made an alliance, and intend shortly to surround Khisht. 84 85 Telegram P., No. 768-S., dated the 15th October 1916.

The letter appears to give a fairly reliable and accurate history of whafc happened, and is rather interesting, so I have sent it on in ease you have not received details of Shiraz events from the same or some other source. Sub-Enclosure. Copy of a letter from Mirza Mahmud Yezdi, Shiraz, to Mr. Zeytoon, Bushire, dated the 20th Zikadah 1334 (=19th September 1916). The Consul and the Bank Manager left Abadeh for Shiraz in company with Farman Farma. His Excellency the Sardar Ashair, who went to welcome the Governor-General, was not permitted by the latter to sit and was blamed for certain matters. The Sardar returned a polite verbal answer and undertook to restore order, and was allowed to return. He reached Baiza in two days- time and sent for Kawam-ul-Mulk. The latter left at once; they staved one nmht at Jushak and made an agreement. Kawam-ul-Mulk then returned to Shiraz and they joined hands with Path-ul-Mulk. On Wednesday moraine-, the 6th, they detained the Ueputy Goyernor-General at his own house and placed 30 Gendarmes, Kashkais and Arabs as his guards. They .taHnrmd men at the Ar- and in such places as they thought necessary : and W closed the Pefsia n n and British telegraph offices and established a censorship. On Thursday, the 7th, they forcibly had the bazar closed so that fhe neople may raise an outcry (against the Governor-General). The people who^were looking forward for the arrival of the Governor-General, that the rountry may be put in order, put oS doing so. The shops were reopened on Krffia^at any rate and on Saturday, they (the authorities) paid the sum of money which they had got ready, to the Ulema, to sign a telegram (to the Capital) stating that the people (“ Millat ”) did not wish Barman Farma to come as Governor-General. . . , The Governor-General’s promises of kindness on the telegraph and telephone did not avail and he had to return with all those with him from Dehbid to Abadek.

But he ,s waiting at Dasht Arzhan up to now. I went to action) iVlZ iaQ and visited hlm - 1 saw that he is well prepared (to take , r Sa , r . dar f f As ^ air - Kawam-ul-Mulk, Yawar Path-ul-Mulk, Samad Agha, Muza Mustafa Khan the late Financial Agent, who is now Kawam’s chief employe, and Mirza Medi Khan, the present Financial Agent, are holding ™ n , fe , roa&lt; : e and P^yiog games of chance day and night. Up to now Mirza ife .di v han has lost 15,000 Tumans. They are continually sending telegrams with a view to getting Farman Farma to come back and that the British may also arrive. The latest answer sent by the Consul was to the effect that he liked to leave for Shiraz, hut regretted that he was not authorised by the Legation. J Sometimes they arrange that the Kawam should go to receive the British and bring them to town ; but affairs are not settled as yet. I have reported all these matters in writing to the newspapers at Tehran. I doubt if my reports will reach them safely. I am sending: a teleoranhie report to the Legation as well. 0 F I am ready to obey your orders and am taking such trouble and incurring losses. But no one appreciates my work. The Arab tribesmen and Gendarmes have raised an outcry on account of want of money, but they have held out promises of supplying them with funds at an early date. To-day Sardar Askair paid Tumans 4,000 to Yawar Fath-ul- Mulk on account of Maliat, in order that he may pay part of it to the Gendarmes so that they may keep silence and spend the balance for the expenses of his journey with 150 Gendarmes to receive the British. H© will surely leave to-morrow evening. Barman Farma and the British are reported to be collecting men at Abadeh. They have detained at Abadeh 1,000 camel loads of wheat which they were bringing with themselves for Shiraz. There is a terrible scarcity of foodstuffs at Shiraz; the people are greatly embarrassed and 10 poor men starve every day. There will be a great trouble soon between the Gendarmes and the Arab tribesmen on account of want of money. Kawam is very sorry; but cannot help it: he is at his wit’s end. The Kashkais are getting tired: if Farman Farma does not give way in another 10 days’ time, Sardar Ashair will go to his winter quarters and Kawam will give in. Ttie Ulema, although they have received money, are not still in favour of Kawam and Soulet. The merchants are also dissatisfied. They have formed a committee composed of Mudabbir- us-Saltaneh and Muayyed-ul-Mulk and such persons, but they are all dis satisfied inwardly. Instructions have been received to send the German prisoners to Tehran : hut owing to the insecurity of the Ispahan road, caused by Cheragh Ali Khan, Bakhtiari, fresh orders were received that the German and Austrian prisoners should be kept at Shiraz itself. Again a telegram was received from the head of the Gendarmes by Yawar* Fath-ul-Mulk telling him to leave at once with a number of men for Abadeh and bring the Consul with ali respects to Shiraz. The Yawar will leave to-night, but I do not believe that the British will think it safe for them to come. The resources of these men are getting to their ends and their business will collapse soon. I regret that the British have no energetic person to work for them. Their only trustworthy and painstaking friend is Karapat, wfi© cannot be free from bis telegraph duty single handed,. interviewe(i Ulema: they are ready to (work for tho Bntish), bnt they want money to be sent them by any means for their expenses so that they may work separately. .[ have seen the Kashkuli clans and they have sworn on the Kuran to join. Yesterday I received large envelopes which had been sent by Major Trevor, the Consul, via Bandar Big and Khisht through Montasir-i-Diwan. I sent it on at once with great precaution to Colonel Gough bv the hands of the Telegraph Ghulam. Haji Amir-ul-Mulk, who was in Sardar Ashair’s prison in Garmsir, died. One thousand loads of goods, escorted by Burasjuni Tufangchis, arrived at Shiraz yesterday, and 700 loads arrived to-day, escorted by Bazeruni Tufang chis. Pakhir-us-Saltaneh has allied himself with Wassmuss, the German at Kamarij and is buying arms and ammunition. Shiraz itself and Ears are disturbed and the people are suffering greatly in every way. If they (the British authorities) agree with you, you may introduce to them a trustworthy person other than Mirza Samad, Jerard and Hai (Malcolm) who can be suspected, and get a sum of money to be sent to him so that he may pay to the Ulema and others in order that a speedy arrangement may be made. Please send me an answer at once. I have been labouring for the last 11 months, have been sending news by telegraph and have been entertaining men, but have received not a single dinar. Enclosure No. 2. PRECIS. (Attack on Wassmuss.) No. 46—405-C , dated Bushire, the 6th October 1916 (Confidential). From— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Acting Consul-General, Bushire, To— Sir Charles M. Marling, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, Tehran. In continuation of my telegram No. 314—1873,* dated 28th September * Serial No 7 1916, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a report made by an emissary who was sent to enquire into the recent attack on Wassmuss and report on his condition. It appears that Wassmuss received two rather severe stabs in the right thigh and two lesser stabs in the left arm. Apparently he is in no danger unless his wounds are very badly looked after. Sub-Enclosure. Report on recent attack on Wassmuss. A reliable emissary, who was sent by the Residency on the 26th September to Borasjun to find out the condition of Wassmuss, has now returned; the following is a note of his report:— He arrived at Borasjun on the 27th and taking his gun went across Gisakun to Bud Eariab under the pretext of buying dates from the Kadkhuda Mulla Haidar. He found all confusion at Bud Eariab. Zair Khidar and Shaikh Hussain had sent 25 Tufangchis under the son of Bais Haidar of Samal (Zair Khidar’s brother-in-law) to escort Wassmuss back to Ahram in a litter: Wassmuss however would not agree to being taken hack in that state, and wishes to wait till he can ride. Our emissary was gradually able to get inside the Kadkhuda’s dwelling : he found Muhammad Beza Hirisi and Saiyid Muhammad Doctor there, as well as the Borasjun Hakim. The latter thought the task of healing beyond him, and that he might incur blame if anything went wrong, so he has resigned and returned to Borasjun. Wassmuss has two deep knife-wounds between the right knee and thigh bone, the lower one of which has penetrated from side to side of the leg. He also has two knife-wounds in his upper right arm whichk mad 5 l^octo^fwm 0 ^^ 6 - t0 Si w He was bein g treated by Saiyid Muham- D ctor from medicines Wassmuss had with him, chiefly fomentations in'muU he IVT ^ t0 talk ' - also be°removed to ThTam. r emiSSary eStimated a g0 ° d 10 da r 9 bcfore he could . A tetter arrived for Wassmuas from while our emissary was there ; iaklir said that if Wassmuss was still able to move, he laknr, would send J? u fangolus to escort him to Kumarij. According to what Aluhammad Reza Dinsi told our emissary, Wassmuss had replied declining and saying he would return to Ahram. 1 ° 0u '; emissary was at End Pariah on the nights of the 28th, 29th and oOtb and leit on the 1st instant, reaching Bushire on the 3rd. The assailant of Wassmuss, Yari Yaghmiri, was also there: he had brought hack the articles looted from Wassmuss and his men, and come to apologise, being rather alarmed some one or other would seek to punish him. Yari s tale to our emissary was that Wassmuss with two companions (one named Mirza Ali and the other seeming like Gharib) on foot from Kalimeh for Jamileh (and Kumanj) missed his way, and went near Bud Eariab instead. They passed lari’s tents about three miles from that place, and were hailed to come and smoke a kalian, hut refused, and said they were “ muqannis” (well diggers of Kazarmi). Yari sent two men after them telling the latter to see whether they were really what they said, if not to loot them. These men returned aitf’r a short while saying that 'Wassmuss and his companions were armed with Mauser pistols, and certainly had articles of value with them. Yari then sallied forth with these two men, he armed only with an iron headed stick. They came up to Wassmuss in a pass. Wassmuss demanded to know what Yari wanted. Yari aimed a blow with his stick which got Wassmuss across the shoulder. Wassmuss seized the stick and closed. He threw Yari, but the latter when underneath stabbed Wassmuss twice in the upper part of the leg. Wassmuss got his revolver out of his belt and aimed at Y^ari’s head, but the bullet only grazed the skin (as our emissary saw r ). Yari then stabbed him again in the arm, and they fell into a small stream, w r hen Yari got Wassmuss under, and Wassmuss cried “ Aman mercy. Yari intended to kill him, but his two men came up with the articles taken off Wassmuss’s men, maps and things which showed Yari that Wassmuss was a stranger of some note. So he left him senseless, his men informing the people of Bud Eariab, who carried Wassmuss back to the village. Muhammad Beza Dirisi returned to Borasjun with our emissary. Enclosure No. 3. Copy of a letter from His Excellency Darya Begi, Governor of the Gulf Ports, Bushire, to the Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf, No, 385, dated 3rd Zihejjeh 1334f( = 2nd October 1916). I have the honour to inform you that I wrote a letter to Zair Khidar Khan before now about restraining the Tangistanis and guaranteeing their conduct in order that they may not come to Bushire and Beshire and make trouble. He has not answered in writing, but he sent a message to Haji Muhammad Hasan stating that he cannot hold himself responsible for and guarantee their good conduct and that we ourselves should take action to check them. What should be done now that the road is open and there is no prevention against them ?* What action should be taken if mischievous persons cause trouble ? It is obvious that an arrangement should be made in this matter so that no trouble or regret may result. Should you think it necessary for me to call on you, I shall be glad to call at Subzabad'at any lime you may fix, so that I may discuss with you any arrangement that may be necessary. * iXOTE.—By message and at an interview His Excellency strongly recommended the closing of the road again ®n account uf the' renewal of the coafeueiauon of the Khans and their truculent attitude.

Most important thing, however, is to avoid anything like a disaster to Gough or Sykes. It seems to me more prudent therefore for Gough and Earman Farma to withdraw from Abadeh and join Sykes at Ispahan. In all cases Sykes must take his instructions from you except (1) when they are in direct conflict with his views, in which case you should refer to me or (2) when local conditions necessitate immediate decision and action, and there is no time to consult you. You will, of course, make no change of plan without reference to Home Office and will keep me and Government of India informed of Sykes’s views, and on your own proposals and instructions to him. It must be made clear to Fussians and to Sykes that as regards Sykes’s present position, his force has a civil and not military character/that he is not to be considered as under General Baratoff’s orders and that he does not form part of Russian forces. I agree with Government of India’s telegram of September 20th. Above all Sykes must be careful not to be drawn into action against Bakhtiari, except in full consultation with you. 2 Telegram R., No. 684 C., dated the 27th (received 28th) September 1916.

I have promised that people of Ears shall not be persecuted for their past opposition to Earman Earma as long as they behave themselves. They asked that Einance A^ent and others dismissed by Persian Government should remain at least till our arrival: I told them I objected very strongly to this, but would telegraph to you and ask you to place question before Council of Ministers who would send definite orders on the subject. I have explained affairs to Earman Earma and he is ready to start next Tuesday, October 3rd. I am telegraphing to Kawam to come and meet us on road.

On September 2lst Major Marsh telegraphs that the Bussian Chief of the General Staff, Caucasus, emphasised the following points:— (1) The routes to Kakavin-Tehran will be closed by General Baratoff. ,(2) Bara toff’s existing force will be maintained up to strength, it will not he increased, but nothing will be taken from it. (3) The greater part of the reinforcements required for this have reached Baratoff already, but it will be another month before all have arrived, as they have to travel on foot from Enzeli. ((4) Although w r ar is an uncertain factor, I think that Baratoff will be in a position to be able to absolutely close the roads which lead to Tehran. (5) The armies of the Caucasus at present have to contend with the weight of the whole of the Turkish army and to spare more men than those mentioned above is impossible. Thefollowing is added by Marsh. Undoubtedly the Bussian Officers have antrigued among themselves with the object of leaving Persia and rejoining the .main army in the Caucasus, but on the retention of Tehran the Czar is quite resolved.

In his absence officers of gendarmerie at Shiraz have made secret overtures me saying they are absolutely sick of situation. They distrust Fath-ul-Mulk and have no money and men are getting out of hand. The officers (including 3 senior officers left there to whom I spoke on telephone secretly last night) tell me they are ready to carry out any orders we may give them even to seizing Soulet. I am informed latter has only about 200 men left in town and Kawam has not many more. According to my information they both know game is up and if we moved, Soulet would depart in a hurry for Garmsir and Kawam would give in. Meanwhile Kawam is dallying with idea of coming to meet me, hut will not actually decide on lines of conduct. I would he much assisted if I knew what Soulet’s reply to Prime Minister’s telegram was. As matters are now rather touch and go in Shiraz, I would request that I may be given permission to use my own discretion as to the advisability of moving on, which, of course, would be only in company and after consultation with Farman Parma.

Hussain Khan and ex-prisoners are now believed to he near Tali Hallal latitude 28° 50', longitude 55°. It is stated that in (?ed) letters he says that Soulet and Kawam have written to Sykes not to come to Shiraz and that Farman Farma has returned to Tehran. It is rumoured that Hussain Khan has not had a warm reception from the Baharlus and others though he was given by Sheikh Abdul Hasan 100 men instructed to act according as events turn. Also that 1,000 men have been collected by Saiyid Abd(ul) Hussain of Lar. It is thought Hussain Khan may return shortly to Khaju or Malikabad. Sirjanis continue disloyal to us. Ex-prisoners’ escort about 92 rifles has been kept in Sirjan, second column originally destined for Kerman having now been ordered to proceed to Yezd. In my opinion total withdrawal of troops from Sirjan at present would almost certainly mean active trouble.

Purther that in these plans which if successful would take 22 days to carry out, presence of my column as garrison of Ispahan was essential in order to release Russian troops here for employment in combined scheme. One squadron and one gun of Russians left here on September 27th, others expected to leave any time. I gather from tone of information that Russians were not too sanguine of success and that if operations unsuccessful, more active co-operation of my column would be necessary.

Utilization of detachment of 108th Infantry at Sirjan as a temporary measure is concurred in, but it should rejoin its regiment as soon as possible. Recruitment of Kerman portion of South Persia Rifles should be expedited as much as possible, as maintenance of order in localities like Sirjan is properly its role. 20 Telegram R., No. 126, dated the 30th September (received 2nd October) 1916.

Sykes’ telegram No. 701-C. Military Attachd thinks that Russian Commander has been drawing on his imagination. In the first place General Baratoff’s command is independ ent and in the second General Chernozubow’s left only reaches Sakiz. Military Attache’s experience shows that Russian local military authorities are kept in ignorance of movements in contemplation. Russian Minister has no objection to Sykes’ leaving Ispahan, but thinks that it is very expedient in connection with Shiraz affairs. 21 Telegram R., dated the 30th September (received 1st October) 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Sykes’ telegram 701-C., dated 30th September. I beg to press again urgency of situation in Pars. If my move on Shiraz is dependent on Sykes* coming immediately, I trust the latter may receive orders to start withoutdelay. Success or failure of large scheme and movements can scarcely be dependent on presence of 450 men, while failure to take advantage of present favourable situation in south might land us in grave difficulties. Personally I am of opinion that we could with perfect safety go forward, provided it is understood that Sykes will follow quickly. Souiet has not been following in traces and is not likely to await our arrival. Kawam has very few men and is in great need of money. Gendarmerie is now absolutely for us and cannot carry on without us. As it is, I am paying from to-day 100 tomans daily for their food. With all deference I venture to urge again necessity of taking advantage of favourable situation, and importance of Sykes’ coming as soon as possible.

Your telegram No. 126 to India, September 30th o I am unable to disclose more of Bussian plans as they were confided to me somewhat unwillingly and under promise of secrecy. I can, however, assure you that they did not emanate from Russian Com mandant as supposed by Military Attache, who forgets that Russian military authorities have to receive instructions and information when taking part in operations. As operations are concerted and have actually commenced, Military Attache’s first and second points apparently fall to the ground. I think that in view of facts given in my telegram No. 701-C., General Baratofi should be, if only from military courtesy, consulted before move of column to Shiraz rather than Russian Minister, who is hardly likely to be in possession of all facts of military situation. Strongly maintain view that column should remain at Ispahan until Turkish retreat unquestionable.

Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Inspector-General, South Persia Military Police, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, I have the honour to give a brief account of _ the march of the column to Yezd and of the position of affairs at that desert city.2. The column started on 26th July, but as Major Lorimer had only reached Kerman on 24th July the staff remained behind until 28th and over took the column at the second stage. 3. The march lay throughout up the wide, level valley which is ideal country for mechanical transport and at the same time easy to protect against robbers. The question of transport, which had been most troublesome on the march from Bunder Abbas, was comparatively easy, as both the mules and camels were properly trained and the marches were easy. The supply question too worked smoothly, a Kerman contractor buying and laying out supplies to the Yezd frontier where Mr. Meriton, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul took up the task. 4. The journey was uneventful. At Rafsinjan four men were arrested for disturbing the peace by pro-German intrigues, but nothing special beino' proved against them, they were released. They will probably be careful in future. 5. The march was of value to me as I was able to find out the exact position as to robbers whose raids have everywhere increased terribly. Two or three new robber tribes have appeared on the scene. Their home is in Yezd territory which stretches two degrees to the south of Yezd city—a fact of some wolitical importance if the Russians retain Yezd in their sphere of influence, phich 1 earnestly hope will not be the case. But the Baharlus still retain the doubtful distinction of being the leading robber tribe. It was rumoured that we were to be honoured by an attack by them which failed to materialise and at the time of writing they are attacking Anar. There is no doubt that this tribe must be crushed by regular troops as a preliminary to the restoration of order in Southern Persia. The fact that the Baharlus have abandoned their nomadic life will make the task less difficult. 6. At Anar I was welcomed by the notables, one of whom was the Russian Agent. He appeared to be a worthy man and said that he had enter tained the Russian Consul at dinner some years ago and had been appointed to tnis post in return. The Russian system of appointing agents at centres where they have no subjects, trade, or other interests gives much scope for intrio-ue. The one subject of the conversation with the notables of Anar was the terrible scourge of brigandage. 7. At Mehdiabad two stages west of Anar the Germans had written some doggerel lines in English on the walls of the Telegraph Rest House signed by Becker and M. M. B.; the latter designated himself as beloDgmo 1 to the 23rd and 42nd Afghan Uhlan Regiment j 8. Yezd was reached on August 14th, the march of 230 miles heino* accomplished in 20 days. The reception was most cordial. On previous occasions I have reported the extraordinary position gained by Hr. White of the C. M. S. and his staff and as years go by this position is strengthened. Mr. Meriton, Telegraph Superintendent and British Vice-Consul, is also popular and respected. He has worked very hard on our behalf. The column was welcomed by the leading notables, some of whom I had known for many years and was entertained in a garden. We then marched on to Mehdiabad, a village two miles short of Yezd, where guns were fired in honour of the arrival of the column. 9. The Governor, the Zia-i-Dooleh, is a Persian of the old school whose feelings were ruffled at not being saluted by Artillery, but recovering from this he was most friendly. He paid the first call and upon returning it°I took the entire force of cavalry through the bazaars. Later, he gave a really splendid banquet in our honour with fireworks. So far he has done everythiuo* X have asked him to do, quite realising his position. Unless we make Yezd safe he will probably resign in true Persian style. . 10. I was visited by representatives of the merchants and by the Parsee Anjuman. In view of the wild rumours obtaining credence I explained the Russian situation and remarked that it was purely temporary and need cause no serious apprehension. The community is deeply interested in the scheme cf organizing the security of the Bunder Abbas-Kerman route, by means of telegraph and telephone lines, by improving the existing track and above all by the creation of ^ new force.11. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan who has earned our gratitude by purchasing 350 mules for the column at the cost of much lisk and trouble sent them off from Ispahan at the beginning of August, but in spite of an escort of Indian sowars, they had to return as robbers were too numerous and strong. Starting a second time they were hung up at Nain by robbers holding No Gumbaz the stage to the south. Sixty gendarmes were sent for, but even with this reinforcement the party was attacked by a strong band of 150^ Lashanis. The village of Akda was reached and a message was sent into Yezd through the telephone station at Ardekan that the party was surrounded. The cavalry, one hundred infantry on riding mules and two machine guns were immediately despatched to the rescue, but the robbers dis appeared before the cavalry could gain touch with them. The Indian Officer and escort and the gendarmes behaved well and the Brigands apparently suffered some casualties whereas only one groom was slightly wounded on our side. It is to be noted that the telephone station at Ardekan was invaluable, forwarding the news a day earlier than it would otherwise have reached Yezd. 12. Copies of this letter are being sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, Sir Percy Cox, His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, His Majesty’s Consul, Herman, and His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Bunder Abbas. 25 No. 8926, dated Basrah, the 10th (received 26th) September 1916. From—The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., Political .Resident in the Persian Gulf and Chief Political Officer, Basrah, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of an interesting letter addressed by Captain Noel, Political Officer with the Bakhtiari Khans, to His Majesty’s Minister on the present Bakhtiari situation and outlook. 2. At the moment the position in regard to Ispahan and Shiraz is in such a state of flux and uncertainty that I see little use in offering present comment and would prefer to wait until the atmosphere is clearer. Enclosure. Dated Chighakhur, the 9th August 1916. From— Captain E. Noel, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, ^ To— Sir Charles Marling, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister and Envoy Extraordinary, Tehran. I I have the honour to address yon on the subject of the general situation in the Bakhtiari country. The remarks 'which follow have reference only to the Khans. Of the tribes themselves it is sufficient to state that purely domestic matters loom so large in their horizon as to dwarf all others: that their sympathies and feeliugs are of the most unsubstantial nature, and that materially they are so dependent on the Khans as to take their cue almost entirely from them. It must not however be assumed that the allegiance of the tribes rests on any very secure basis or that the present relations between ruled and rulers possess any considerable elements of stability. In treating therefore of the general situation as reflected by the bearing and conduct of the Khans, it may make my subsequent remarks more intelligible if I try to explain the present attitude of the Khans to the role they have played in the past, and to their aspirations and hopes for the present and future. I think it may be safely assumed that the elder and more experienced members of both families haye little doubt that whatever the result of the10 war in Europe, it will not remove tlie Bakhtiari destinies from our keeping. Of the younger generation there are some such as Salar Masoud who feel that they have burnt their boats, and others such as Sirdar Eateh who cannot acknowledge the logic of facts owing to their pro-Turkish sympathies. In the same way the more sensible of the Khans have now realized that they made a mistake in not throwing in their lot with us definitely at Ispahan, Yezd and Kerman. On the other hand they look on their fault as one of omission and not commission. The Bakhtiari Khans share to such a marked decree the typical Persian characteristics of following the line of least resist ance and waiting to have ones hand forced by the march of events, that often in conversation, after starting by the admission that they failed us, they unconsciously veer round to the argument that they really deserve credit for having run counter to the strong trend of popular feeling to the extent they did. With this frame of mind, they are more or less honest with themselves in arguing that the complete loss of Ispahan as spelt by the Zil es Sultan’s reinstatement is a punishment out of all keeping with the laches on their part which called it forth. With the holders of the above opinion it is diffi cult hut still possible to argue, but the same cannot be said for a considerable section of the younger Khans, of whom I would take Sirdar Patch as a representative, who lay claim to merit on the grounds that they refrained from attacking the oil fields and allowed us to use the Ahwaz-Ispahan road when our fortunes were at a low ebb. A further trait is the strong impression that the war has only temporarily effaced Anglo-Kussian rivalry in 1/ersia, and that as soon as peace has been declared we will fall back on the Bakhfciaris as a valuable asset in extending our political influence. Bor this reason they cannot understand our not being secretly pleased at the success of their efforts to embarrass the Russians at Ispahan. The chief characteristics of the more responsible of the chiefs may therefore he summarised as a failure to see themselves as we see them, and a realization that they must stand in with us combined at the same time with a belief that we will wish to use them as a pawn in the game of political rivalry. The personal outlook and feelings of the K bans do not, however, affect the Bakhtiari situation as much as material facts. The Khans, like their tribesmen, are so easily swayed by each fresh development that presents itself. Bor this reason the main pivot on which most Bakhtiari questions now hinge is the loss of Ispahan and its falling into the hands of their heredi tary enemy the ZU1 es Sultan. The loss of Kerman and Yezd they are prepared to take more or less philosophically. These governments were after all perquisites, and still retained a good deal of the nature of a windfall. The same may be said to a lesser degree of Ispahan. The loss of the Government of Ispahan they were perhaps prepared to accept. The arrival of the Zill, however, means a good deal more to them than the loss of the Governorship. It means in fact that life for them in Ispahan is no longer possible. During the last few years the Khans have come to look on Ispahan as part and parcel of the heritage. In addition to their extensive properties in the district and their houses in the town, Ispahan represented to them their link with the culture and life of the outside world. To be cut off from Ispahan is dimly felt by them to amount to a decree of banishment from the new fields of progress and enlightenment which had been opened up to them, and a rude forcing back to the state and ways of the primitive migratory tribes from which they so congratulate themselves on having emerged. So far the Khans have been quite unable to reconcile themselves to the thought that Ispahan has definitely passed from their hands. It is possible to argue with them dispassionately mat they have brought this calamity on to their own heads, but in the course of conversation it becomes clear that they look on the restoration of the old position as being in the natural order of things. Whether the Khans will passively accept the fact that the Zill has come fo stay must to a great extent depend on the course of events in Persia. It may be safely said that in accordance with their chief characteristic of follow* ing the line of least resistance a section of the Bakhtiaris will certainly makean effort to recover Ispahan by force of arms provided a suitable opportunity presents itself or the Germans succeed in forcing their hands. On the other hand, providjed affairs in Persia continue to run in our favour in a normal manner, as they have been doing for the last few months, there is every like lihood of the Khans natural inertia of character causing the German agitation and the irritation over the loss of Ispahan to die a natural death. The above observations refer only to the question of active oppostion. Unfortunately the Bakhtiaris have it in their power to cause embarrassment to the Ispahan Government in an entirely passive manner. I refer to their encouragement of lawlessness in the Ispahan district, reports of which have doubtless readied you from various sources. This matter is one which requires some explanation. In the case of the more responsible of The Khans ^t would be a mistake to accuse them of having definitely sent plundering bands to harry and rob Lenjan and Faraidun. The most notable of the robber chiefs were a thorn in the side of previous Bakhtiari Governors at Ispahan and even in their recent operations they have in many cases failed to respect Bakhtiari property. On the other hand these predatory bands are only able to operate on their present scale and with their present success owing to their knowledge that the Khans approve their activities in so far as they tend to discredit and embarrass the Zill’s Government. The robber leaders ask for no better assistance or encouragement which spells for them the existence of a base from which to carry on their operations. That this is a true representa tion of the case is beyond doubt, and the Khans in conversation tacitly acknowledge it to be such. In this connection I would mention that a general meeting of the Khans at which I tried to impress on them the necessity of giving us some tangible proof of their friendship which we could use to disarm Russian suspicions A.~.ir Mujahid came out with the remark that if only the Russians would appoint a neutral Governor, the Bakhtiaris would co-operate with them to such an extent that the menace of Jafter Quli and Reza Khan would disappear in a very short space of time. Of course there is a certain section of the Khans, who may be referred to as the extremist party, who have deliberately sent their adherents to join the marauding bands across the Bakhtiari border. But, on the other hand, we have in pleasing contrast the example of the 111 Begi, Sirdar Muhtasham, who, I have every reason for believing, is doing his best to keep the tribesmen quiet ( and counteract the evil influence of the other Khans. The question arises as to whether this passive form of resistance will ah o die a natural death. If left to itself I am afraid there is little chance of tie Khans putting a stop to it. The solution would therefore appear to lie in ti e Russians being able to deal with the present disorder and insecurity in spite cf Ihe Bakhtiari Khans, i.£., to ignore their opposition. It would seem to me, however, that our attitude of hands off the Bakhtiari Khans, accompanied by a refusal to take any active measures ourselves will be a difficult one to maintain vis-a-vis the Russians. A further point for consideration is that the Bakhtiaris, owing to their geographical position and close ties with Ispahan, must sooner or later come into contact with the Russians and have considerable dealings with them. In this case it would obviously be to our advantage to have the Bakhtiari internal situation well in hand, and thus be in ,a position to guide and control the Bakhtiari external relations with the Russians. It will thus be seen that the present situation in Bakhtiari country has two aspects, firstly, the danger resulting from the presence of the Germans and the ■possibility of a further Turkish success near Kermanshah giving the Bakhtiaris an opportunity of seizing Ispahan ; secondly, the probability that the present policy of passive obstruction to the Zill’s Government will eventually force us or the Russians to intervene. In my telegram No. 388, I suggested as radical remedy for both these states of affairs, our strengthening the hands of the 111 kham and 111 Begi by Lelnino- them to raise an irregular Bakhtiari force, and our supplying a stiffen ing' of a small contingent of regular troops the object of the latter being to provide a stimulus to keep the Khans up to the mark. It, however, the Turkish success at Kermanshah is considered merely as a flash in the pan, andthat in consequence we run little risk in allowing the Germans to remain in Bakhtiari country, it only remains for us to find a solution for remedying the sf-cond state of affairs. In the telegram already referred to such a solution was indicated in the alternative suggestion that we should raise a Bakhtiari police force under British officers. Since the expression of those views I have been much exercised as to the question of finding some modus vivendi between the Khans and the Zill es Sultan, provided the latter is to be a fixture at Ispahan. The only solution i hat has so far occurred to me is that we should endeavour to effect a formal reconciliation between the Zill and the Khans. I have not approached the Khans on the matter, but I have every reason to believe that the scheme is a perfectly feasible one provided the Zill can be persuaded to settle the blood feud in the accepted tribal manner by paying the Khans a visit in their country. I am not, of course, in a position to express an opinion as to how the Zill would view the proposal, but I cannot help feeling that if you could see your way to visit the Bakhtiari country this autumn, your presence and influence might provide just the inducement required to persuade the Zilt to accompany you and make his peace with the Khans. It would seem to me that this proposal should be considered independ ently on its own merits. It would of course be a fitting complement to the adoption of either of the more redical remedies already suggested, but should not, I think, be looked upon in any way as an alternative measure or substi tute. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Chief Political Officer, Basrah. 28 No. 355-C., dated Bushire, the 13th (received 26th) September 1916 (Confidential). From— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. \ In continuation of my telegram No. 1812 of to-day, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, translations of letters written from Sirjan on 2nd August 1916 by Dr. Sutoras Herr Biug- mann and Obeydullah the Turkish emissary to Herr Seiler at Shiraz, describ ing their position subsequent to their arrest at Kerman by Brigadier-General Sir P. Sykes in June last. 2. The messenger bringing these letters was intercepted at Shiraz by Nejaf Khan, the Intelligence Agent, who managed to get hold of the letters by promising the bearer that he would not be punished, Nejaf Khan got a trans lation made at Shiraz by some one who knew German, and it is no doubt a rough one; I have had no means of checking it, as Nejaf Khan was afraid to send the original letters by post in case they sirouid go astray. 3. The letters form an interesting comment on Sir P. Sykes’ despatches, Nos. 68-P. and 74rP., dated 19th July 1916. 4. A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Enclosure No. 1. Translation of a letter from Dr. Sutoras to Herr Seiler, dated the 2nd August 1916. As I told you in my last letter, Obeydullah, Brugmann, Dettmer (torpedo engineer) and Oertel (merchant and technical expert) both of latter being civilian prisoners who have escaped from the Russians arrived in Sirjan the 29th July under Persian escort. Officer in charge of escort, Prince Husain, has been ordered by General Sykes to remove me and the sick men to Bunder Abbas. I didn't want to go and tried to delay the start by arguing the point hoping to get correct news from Shiraz. I thought this all the more desirable because I heard that you and the rest in Shiraz were free and that Wassmuss was advancing from Bushire to Shiraz. I/Y e also get good news here fromKertttanshali which was perhaps why Sykes ordered our and Oheydnllah’s removal to Bunder Abbas, and why on the 26th July he himself with all his officers and men left Kerman for Yezd, from which place he means to go to ^ Shiraz. At first he wanted to go to Shiraz via Sirjan, but the road is closed by the Baharlus. The Baharlus have also closed the road to Bunder Abbas, and two weeks ago they looted a British Consul at Daulatabad, caught him but let him get away again. Now Sykes has received news from Kashan and Kermanshah and about the Baharlus blocking the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz road whereupon he retired on Meshed, He does not say so himself, I merely think personally that he won’t go to Shiraz at all, but straight into Khora- san to join the Bussians. He has with him 80 sowars, 120 Indian Infantry and five or six officers. Apparently he has * * * guns. The Indians wept daily with Obeydullah and kissed his hands(?) they are frightfully cut up at his being a prisoner. There must be something going to happen because Adles- Bultan gave me a horse the very day we heard Sykes had left Kerman. We all want to come to you except Obeydullah who will perhaps return to Kerman. If you are in strong enough position in Shiraz, please send us an escort. Prince Husain the officer in charge of escort will try to (help us to) escape so that we may all be free again, though penniless. Brugmann has no money either, Sardar Zafar took all his carpets and private effects. The English examined and tormented Brugmann terribly, Sykes reproached him with all sorts of things that had nothing to do with him. The Persians say Hr. Biach voluntarily surrendered to the English. Sykes continually quoted Biach saying to Brugmann—My friend Hr. Biach told me * * * * I am fed up with letter writing, I have written about fifteen times already and never get any reply. I am now free(?), but Obeydullah, Brugmann (and the Afghans) are very strongly guarded, suppose they will soon be free like you. If possible please let me know how things are with you and whether we .can get to Shiraz or not. With most cordial greetings to all, especially to Austrians and yourself, from us all. (The following in the m argin):—Baharlus wanted us to go with them to Harab, no good(?) Enclosure No. 2. Translation of a letter from Brugmann (?) to Consul Seiler, Shiraz, date? As Obeydullah has already told you in his letter, we are now in Sirjan en route for India. The English have cleaned me out completely. I have not yet given up all hope of an attempt to rescue us being made from Shiraz, if possible please do your best; how is Mr. Professor Hoctor Zugmeyer, at present ? If he is in Shiraz please tell him of my being a prisoner, and also let him know that Biach is in Bombay and that his last letter to me (mentioned by Hr. Sutoras) never reached me. We shall try to spin out our stay in Sirjan as long as possible. I hope you and the other gentlemen are all in the best of health and send you all greeting. If Mr. Hr. Zugmeyer is there ask him to transmit my compliments to Greisinger and Weding. Hope we shall soon all meet again in freedom. Enclosure No. 3. Translation from a letter written in French from Obeydullah to Herr Seiler, dated 2nd August 1916. I take this opportunity to write you a line. I knew what has happened to you during your voyage and your piesent condition in Shiraz. After your departure I stayed in Kerman till General Sykes arrived. A fortnight after his arrival I was arrested in the name of the Government of India, that was June 26th, and on July 16th I, Brugmann and two otherGermans, who had escaped from Russia, started for Bunder Abbas as prisoners of war, we have been at Sirjan a fortnight, recently we heard you were at liberty. These days we hear many favourable pieces of news. Please let us know how you are getting on, and come and save us from the hands of the English, who have already disappeared after receiving news recently from Kerman. We expect you and news of you w)th impatience. Compliments to all, &amp;c. Dear Sir. 27 Telegram R., No. 711-C., dated the 30th September (received 3rd October) 1916. Prom— Bkigadier-General Sir P.

I have the honour to forward herewith the original of the Agreement signed by the Sarhadi Sardars on 30th April 1916. (Translation.) AGREEMENT. We the Sardars whose seals and signatures are given below hereby agree to accept the allowances fixed by General Dyer, commanding the British forces on the frontier for our Sardars and notables and we agree in return to fulfil all the following conditions which we now write down :— (1) We will always remain faithful and loyal to the British Government. (2) Erom to-day neither we ourselves nor our tribe will give any trouble in British territory or to British employes, subjects or inhabitants and we will not harbour any intention of giving trouble either. If by any chance our tribe should fail to carry out this promise, we will arrest the man responsible and hand him over to General Dyer, his representative, or the officers in charge at the place where the act contrary to this promise has been com mitted. If any man should be the cause of spreading revolt, the officers in authority at the time shall be fully entitled to punish him as they think fit and no objection will be made to their action and no sardar or notable shall have any right to put forward any recommendation for mercy. In short the British Government shall punish the guilty man in accordance with the criminal law. (3) All the sardars of the district will regard that man who is an enemy to the British Government as their own enemy. If any German or other person should wage war or create a disturbance against the British Govern ment then it will be the duty of us, sardars, to oppose him. If we are not strong enough to oppose him successfully by ourselves, we will at once inform the frontier officers in authority at the time and with our own lashkars assist ing those of Government wall do our best to destroy the enemy utterly. (4) If we hear in our district or elsewhere that any German or other spy belonging to a hostile state or parties of them have been trying to spread any form of trouble or discontent we will arrest the same and hand them over to the officers in authority. (5) We promise to bring before the General the 500 young men required by the British Government for frontier work with the levies within 10 or 15 da\s at the latest, and we will appoint one man as an officer with each tribe represented among this number.

(fe) If Government should require wood, grass, &amp;c., accommodation, fat tailed sheep, goats, fowls, eggs, &amp;c., then we sardars will help to provide them as far as we can, and as regards payment we will hold a committee with a British officer as President to fix the correct rates.‘Kfli'rs’ ' - ■ 1 : V 16 (9) The British Goyernment shall build forts and thanas wherever they please and w T e shall raise no objection.

L My telegram, No. 152 is substantiated by report received from Wagstaff. Fight apparently took place 27th—28th September. Our casualties were two killed and four wounded. Wagstaff, who had a bullet through hat, estimates enemy at 300. As he saw only 20 or 30 leave town, he thinks they were mostly towns-people. He also suspects 60 armed Laris who arrived in the town the day before. Being unable to identify culprits he has imposed fine of 15,000 tomans on town. Ot this I approve, provided it is really practicable. It will give rise to protests no doubt. &amp; We got slight assistance from less than a quarter of the local levies. According to Persian reports Lorenz, Austrian and Bruggmann were with Hussain Khan and Wagstaff thinks that it is probable. Evacuation of Sirjan which would have to be complete, might in itself be a risky move and besides placing Sirjan in hands of ex-prisoners and Hussain Khan would reduce our prestige everywhere to nil.

Your telegram No. 721-S, September 30th. I concur in views of Consul, Kerman’s telegram 155. In my opinion it would be dangerous and unreasonable to expect Persians whether villagers or townsmen to fight tribes men until trained for considerable period and supported by artillery and machine guns. Arrival of column Shiraz will improve situation of Kerman Province. Probably, however, attack by column on Baharlus with co-oneration of Kawam and Sirjan detachment will be &gt; necessary both for protection of Bunder Abbas telegraph and road and restoration of British prestige. Meanwhile in my opinion reinforcements should remain Sirjan. 44 Telegram R., No. 109-F., dated the 7th (received 8th) October 1916. From— Lietttenant-Colonel H.

Earman Earma wishes us to arrange with Bakhtiaris to bring cleaned wheat and barley to Kumisha, whence he will transport it to- Shiraz. Could not arrangements also be made to bring wheat from Karachi vie* Bushire ? I consider matter urgent. Arrangements might be made through Noel to purchase 2,000 kharwas wheat and 500 kharwas barley from Chahar Mahal and have it cleaned and landed at best price possible at Kumisha. I foresee much trouble unless we do something soon. 45 Telegram P., dated the 4th (received 9th) October 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kerman, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated Cox, Tehran and Sykes). My telegram No. 152 and your telegram 721-8.^ Commandant, Kerman, concurs with me that South Persian Bifles are not serviceable or trained force and are unlikely to be so for a couple of years. Suitable recruits are difficult to obtain; we have at present 500, but only 30 horses and no saddlery. There are only 50 old gendarmes and 30 tribesmen, i.e. 9 men accustomed to arms and as such immediately available for rough and ready service. As I expected, Sirjan levies have, except as a political measure, proved a failure. Local tribesmen are at present quite unreliable being constitutionally opposed to all discipline and their chiefs will not part with control over them. We must not regard Sirjan as a watertight compartment. Situation in Kerman town and province will be vitally affected if it passes from our control. In Kerman town there is a democratic element which has been active for some time and which we have been trying to identify and suppress. Sympathies of tribes are not with us and Sirdar Nusrat and other doubt fully stout-hearted friends have no influence over them. f ; M 48 Telegram R., No. 741-C., dated the 7th (received 9th) October 1916.

As one of the Kasid Bashi’s men is proceeding to Bushire, I write this to enquire after your honoured health and inform you of the events which have taken place in the course of the past two days. It is not unlikely that you may know something about the former annoyance of the people of Bars with H. H. Barman Barma’s adminis tration. When it was announced to the people that H. H. Barman Barma had been appointed Governor-General, they all began to object to him, and at last revolted. But in view of the frequent telegrams and persistence of the British Minister I set about pacifying the people, and gave assurances that the conduct of the subordinates of H. H. Barman Barma would not be as it used to be in former times. I said besides that the supervision of the British Minister and British officials would prevent certain acts of oppressions and unjustifiable conduct occurring. His Excellency Sardar Mu’tazad, the Deputy Governor-General, arrived. Contrary to my promises and assurances, he so devoted himself to ill-treating the people and taking bribes and presents from them that they lost all patience and demanded the immediate recall of H. H. Barman Barma with the utmost violence, and were contemplating very harsh measures against Sardar Mu’tazad. In order to protect him and prevent a mishap, a number of guards have been set over him. Under such circumstances and with the present rupture, which exists between the people and the Governor-General, it would be impossible for any one to submit to the Governor-Generalship of Barman Barma. It has been with considerable trouble that we have just silenced the people in the telegraph office and persuaded them to return to their houses, and to open their shops and bazaars. They did not go until they received explicit assurances from myself, Sardar-i-Ashair and Major Bath-ul-Mulk that H. H. Barman Barma would turn back. Several messages have been telegraphed to Colonel Gough, the British Consul for Bars, who is at Dehbid at present, to the effect that he should come to Shiraz with the other British officials and subjects, in company with the sowars who are sent as their escort, and witness the actual progress of events. I have given full assurances and pledged myself that the interests of the British Government in Bars whether commercial, political or otherwise would be perfectly safe and stengthened after the arrival of the Colonel, and the introduction of preliminary reforms, and that they would be entirely to the satisfaction of the authorities of the British Government. Negotiations are not yet complete, but I have troubled you thus far in order that you may be informed. Of course you will represent the situation to His Honour Major Trevor. Ibrahim. ' u i ill m Sub' Unclosure. A notice issued by Sardar-i-Asbair, Kawam-ul-Mulk, and Fath-ul-Mulk at Shiraz on the 12th Zi-Qaadeh 1334 (=llth September 1916). We respectfully beg to remind all the inhabitants of Bars of the following jpdiCti • - Of course you are well aware,/rom the time the Gendarmerie Department was establishment in Bars up to this time, what valuable and conspicuous services this Department has accomplished and what measures were taken by the said Department to secure the comfort and welfare of mankind, and to maintain order and safety on roads and highways.Everyone knows that all of them risked their lives, were ready to serve and have not even for one moment neglected the discharge of their duties. They have afforded the Government establishments all that is necessary for assistance and support, as for instance a number of them has been sent to the Police Department with a view to secure order, comfort and welfare for the inhabitants of this town and in order that they may be on duty. At present they are, indeed, rendering a real service, inasmuch as they are allied with all the people and are of the same opinion with them. At present they are sacrificing their lives for the maintenance of order in Ears and its preservation. Gendarmes are the favourites of all the inhabitants of Ears and we consider them as our real brothers and children. It is incumbent upon every individual inhabitant of this town to pay them due respect. Should it be heard and found out that any have contra vened this, he will incur great censure and serious responsibility. Ismail Kashqai, Sardar-i-Ashair. Ibrahim, Qawam-ul-Mulk. Eath-ul-Mulk, ^awar. Enclosure No. 2. Translation of a letter from Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh, Khan of Borasjun, to Hassan Khan Tangistani, Bushire, dated the 17th Zi-Qaadeh 1334) ( = 16th September 1916), Apparently you have again gone to Bushire and this going to Bushire of yours is and will be cause for suspicion on the part of Zair Khidar and Shaikh Hussain. I told you myself that they objected the first time you went and re quested you not to go again : nevertheless you have done so and caused them to be angrier than before. They have now sent a man especially asking me to make you return, also to remove you from Chah Arabi and put you elsewhere so that you may not be a neighbour of theirs. They also say that they have* received intelligence from Bushire to the effect that you are lying when you say you go there to see your mother and brother, you only go to see the English, who have promised you money and ammunition to take secretly to Chah Arabi, and having spread disaffection amongst the Tangistanis, to arrange an attack on them (Zair Khidar and Shaikh Hussain). They have also received a report that you are in constant attendance on the English consulting them and making plans, &amp;c., &amp;c., while you neither consult me nor consider the after effects. After all what have the English done for you in the past that you should expect anything from them in the future ? It is very surprising that you still shoot arrows at the target. At the time Zair Khidar and Shaikh Hussain had not tested the English and were slightly afraid of them, they paid them small attention. All those threats of the English to turn them out and their attempts to ruin them, what did you get out of 5 it that you should get anything now, when by the grace of God to-day they (Zair Khidar and Shaikh Hussain) consider themselves the victors, and have not the slightest fear. My dear one “ why should a wise man do things which he will regret afterwards ’’? Although you know they objected to your first visit, in connection with which I have not yet appeased them, you go ao-ain and give them opportunity to talk and get me into trouble. You know I cannot dissociate myself from them. Why have you gone to Bushire without consult ing me ? Of course you must return at once and apologise to Zair Khidar Khan and Shaikh Hussain Khan and must not delay at all leaving Bushire at once, otherwise it will be a cause of complaint. 48 No. 1092, dated Quetta, the 28th September 1916 (Confidential).

There is no apparent reason why trial of Hormuz and Abdul Aziz should be delayed for arrival of Jan Muhammad and Hassan Ali, whose case should be reported separately for orders. Question of validity of defence need not be anticipated.

From—The Officer Commanding, Kerman, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. Report from Wagstaff, dated night of 30th September. 2728, Hussain* Khan with a following of 20 or 30 men entered Saidabad and seized the towers and walls being apparently assisted by the whole town. The town was- -surrounded and attacked by W. The engagement lasted for the whole day.-Hussain Khan with 20 horsemen at sunset bolted from the place and got away, Casualties on our side reported: Indians—killed 2, wounded 3, Persians—^ wounded 3. Casualties of enemy are uncertain, hut 10 are reported. Sbazda (?) Hussain and Bruggmann, Lerentz (?) were said to have been with Hussain, but not Obeydullah. In Wagstaff’s opinion the latter has made for Afghanistan. Hussain Khan is said to have returned to Balvard, Under the circumstances, reference your 665-C., a request is again made that reinforce ments may remain at Sirjan. Should this not be granted, a withdrawal altogether from Sirjan will have to be made, as it is unsafe to leave only 70 rifles there. Such a withdrawal would have a disastrous effect on Sirjan and the whole of the province it is considered. This telegram repeated to Chief of the General Staff, is addressed to Sykes, 54 (lieceived with Army Department memorandum No. 11190, dated the 9th October 1916.)

The following is in continuation of my 317, dated October 3rd. Wagstaff lays especial emphasis on the fact that the inhabitants of Saidabad let Hussain Khan, who was accompanied by only about 30 men, into the town by nigbt and that there were some 300 men firing on our troops from the walls during the fight. To have entered the town at all Hussain Khan must have been very sure of the inhabitants. The whole town was against us and the district was most unwilling to help. During the fight the levies kept well in the background. Wagstaff asks for more money, stores, ammunition and another gun. There are only Persians here to escort these to him. I am sending, however, all hut the gun, as I consider Sirjan the key to Kerman and a clear and fruitful field would be left to Hussain Khan and escaped prisoners by withdrawal from there. This telegram repeated to Chief of the General Staff is addressed Sykes. 55 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 11131, dated the 7th October 1916.)

Continuation my 23301-Cipher. Bellowing information obtained from Arab officers. The expedition of the Turks to Persia was undertaken with the object of protecting left wing, 6th Army, though if the German Mission was successful, Turks had great hopes of Afghanistan joining them. The Kermanshah advance was continued for the purpose of drawing troops away from Mecklen- berg and the latter’s failure to cover left wing resulted in stoppage of advance at Hamadan. Mecklenberg’s force described as independent; see my 21553. Kaiding force of Kalouri and Sinjabi tribes (Turks’ principle Persian sup porters), hacked by Turkish cavalry, could easily have been sent by Turks, but they feared lack of reinforcements and Russian advance from Kazvin. Turks remain at Hamadan for Political (reasons ?). Turks depend almost entirelv on local supplies. There are no supplies between Mahidasht and Khanikin. Great difficulty is experienced by the Turks in bringing up supplies from Baghdad, especially between Khusuabad and Mahidasht and between Saripul and Paitak. Turks are very short of transport, 110 horses and mules per battalion being reduced to 92 in bad condition (and several ?) two wheeled carts. Three roads were used in advancing, one division advancing by centre road and half division on each flank. Left wing arrived Kermanshah 3 days after remainder.

As I have already informed you, I eonsider in view of past proceed ings and Par man Parma’s opinion expressed to me exchange of Governors between Kerman and Pars is advisable. On the other hand I should like to know if and when it is quite decided to keep His Highness for Pars, as I believe that there is a better chance now of breaking up confederacy. Patul Mulk is said to be wavering and his defection would probably carry off Kawam while Soulet cannot possibly keep large forces much longer at Shiraz as they want to go to winter quarters. &amp; Parman Parma is showing signs of extreme nervousness and I must doubt if he is strong man he was once considered to be. If exchange is effected, I consider we could certainly go on without delay or waiting for Sykes. Fat-ul-Mulk has promised to arrest Wassmuss if he tries to go to Shiraz.

I have sent Paschen German prisoner handed over to me by Governor of Abadeh under escort to Kumishah where he will be met by escort from Sykes’ f ce and taken to Ispahan. I allowed prisoner to take his personal belongings, but have confiscated all arms and ammunition and animals belonging to him and also hold about 800 mule-loads of stuff he claims as personal, such as antiques bought in Ispahan, carpets and duries. I would ask instructions as to their disposal. ISome arms and one horse and all ammunition, including 4 boxes of bombs, manufactured in Ispahan, I have handed over to Parman Parma for his force, remainder are in my charge. Governor here handed in bill for over 1,900 tomans for maintenance of prisoner, his servants and animals during five months he kept them, and I have promised to pay him this amount. Prisoner, alleged Governor, took £1,400 in gold from him at the time of capture but the Governor of course denies. I believe carpets, et cetera, to be merchandise and not bom fide personal belongings but his papers, which are being translated, may show truth. All papers will be sent to Sykes at a suitable opportunity. Telegram R., No. 94)-F., dated (and received) the 21st September 1916. From— Lieutenant-Colonel H.

As I have not received Government of India’s telegram 606 (660 ?), I am in the dark as to why Parnum Parma’s force should return. &lt; To-day reports from Shiraz show excitement among gendarmes, only quieted by Path-ul-Mulk promising Sykes and Consul going down soon and paying. Both he and Kawam seem to be short of money. Samad is sure to harp on his idea of Kawam and Soulet coming to meet me and then arranging an uprising against the latter in his absence from thp city. I consider this very doubtful diplomacy and if it failed very dangerous pnd J would rather have nothing to do with it. 347 348Parraan Farm a wishes me to send last invitations to the three to give in* but pending ne^ws from you as to our policy I feel inclined to wait.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Gough’s reports from Shiraz lead him to believe that he could proceed there alone if we drop Farman Farma; this is not borne out by my own informa tion nor do I think it possible for any European to control so turbulent a province as Fars unless backed by an adequate force without the assistance of the advice and authority of able Persian. My own view, shared apparently by Persian Government, is that opposi tion to Farman Farma merely cloaks opposition to Sykes’ mission and that insistence on latter implies insistence on former and in my opinion we cannot abandon projected Southern Persian Bifles without gravest results not only in Fars but elsewhere. Eoever and other political prisoners have been released at Shiraz, while I hear others are still in custody. As this is likely to make position more difficult, I am afraid it will be risky for Sykes to endeavour to proceed without further force to support him. Despatch of a column as proposed in my tele gram 620 is earnestly recommended. Farman Farma and Gough are still at Abadeh but will not be able to remain for more than a few days owing to difficulty of supplying their column of some 650 to 700 men. I, therefore, hope that decision may soon be reached pending which Persian Government is moreover unable to shape its action.

I think you have been ^misinformed as to the number of camels that come to Khwash. The actual juumbers are as follows:—July 955 (words omitted) September 272, total 1,679 for 2J months, and this number includes only 1,162 carrying food* jsupplies for men and horses.Bhoosa is not required for horses at Khwash as instead they are always fed on Burshonk, a local cutting; but after 15th October it is very difficult to obtain Burshonk and for this reason and also to ease the grain question two troops were sent back to Saindak and they are now on their way to Kobat. Animals being at Khwash when Burshonk is obtainable must ease supply question very considerably as there is no bhoosa in Khwash and the price of Burshonk at Khwash is only two annas a maund. The retention of some camels at each post for movement should give animals a rest in turn, but I agree that we have not enough camels at present, and more have been asked for. I understand that 1,000 more will arrive shortly. As regards length of marches, this question is determined by the position of camping ground where water exists and may sometimes be over and some times under 15 miles. Any further reduction of the force at Khwash is not recommended as some sections of the Yar Mohammedzais and Gamshadzais are reported to be on the point of coming in to give up their arms and a show of strength is advisable at Khwash at present. As soon as ever reduction is possible, the Chief of the General Staff will be asked for orders. No transport camels can be procured in the Sarhad as the majority of the local tribes have lost many camels owing to the prevalence of disease in the Sarhad. I think idea with regard to Bam is good and am consulting Keyes as to whether that place is (portion of Sarhad or not. I do not recommend cavalry being changed into camelry as former is invaluable in the plains of Khwash and Galugan, and the Damanis know that they cannot very easily escape if they enter Sarhad owing to the rapidity with which they can be overtaken and held by cavalry.

Persian Government with whom I have been discuss ing Pars situation are of opinion that Parman Parma’s appointment should be maintained. Its abandonment would weaken what little authority Persian Government possess and be serious blow to British prestige. Shah is also for the present anxious to support Parman Parma. In view of undoubted fact that action of (Soulet ?) and Kawam has been promoted by Zil-es-Sultan’s party in order to obtain Governorship of Pars for him or Akbar Mirza (see my telegram 283, April 29th) and that it will not be difficult to dispel Soulet’s illusion that Zil-es-Sultan can rely on Russian support in this matter the Persian Government consider that alliance between Kawam and Soulet cannot be of long duration and that its dissolution can be expedited by dismissal of Soulet from Kashgai Chieftainship and similar means. On the other hand they admit that opposition to Sykes’ mission is real, but consider that it has acquired exaggerated importance through machination of Zil-es-Sultan’s party and will not in itself re-unite Soulet and Kawam when once their alliance has been broken up and Parman Parma has got into saddle at Shiraz. In this view I concur heartily. Having embarked on establishment of Southern Persian Rifles we cannot now withdraw from this policy and I submit that we should direct our efforts to that end and devote to it the resources (and in particular Sykes’ Column) that we have in Persia. The process with such support as Persian Government can give must, however, be slow without further assist ance, but could be greatly expedited by despatch to Bunder Abbas or some other port of a force similar to that which Government of India was willing to send to Bunder Abbas last spring to provide safe base for Sykes’ mission. Advance thence could be made towards Shiraz. That its appearance would at once ensure Kawam’s future loyalty, the Persian Government are convinced; and an assertion of vigour now after so many months passivity will spare us a much greater effort later and will give us some sorely needed consideration (?)

My opinion is that it would he most unwise to withdraw whole regular troops from Sirjan while prisoners are still at large. By so doing Hussain Khan would be left free to return and prisoners to recommence their intrigues amongst the tribes. I consider a small force there most necessary under the present circumstances, because Sirjan is a most important tribal centre. Merrill and Wagstaff both report that the / levies are most unreliable and suggest disbanding a portion of them. Wagstaff has already been directed by me to destroy Hussain Khan’s fort at Balwand and also the fort at Khushrui. There is no information in my possession at present regarding Haji Abdul Hasain mentioned in your tele gram as supplying funds to prisoners. While prisoners still at large suggest at least 100 Indian troops remain in Sirjan. The balance with details and sick bring doctor and invalid prisoners to Kerman. This small force would be required here to act escort to money or supplies which may be required to be sent to Sirjan and also to guard these prisoners. The Consul at this place agrees with me.

He has been supplied by me with such funds as I could arrange and has thus been enabled to carry on till now. I am informed by Cox that he has authorised Gough to spend money in excess of emergency allotment without limit and has supplied him with £5,000 already and is now sending him £2,000 in gold. As there seems no reason why Barman Parma’s expenses should not be borne by Persian Government eventually I should be glad to receive author ity to make an arrangement with them on lines suggested in my telegram No. 589.

From—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Ramsay, K.C.I.E, C.S.I., Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, To—The Secretary to the Government to India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. I have the honour to enclose, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the Political Agent, Sarhad’s appreciation of the Sarhad political situation. Enclosure. The Political Agent, Sarhad’s appreciation of the Political situation. General Dyer has now returned from his march through the Gamshadzai country and to Jalk with the results already stated in his diary. The political situation is as follows By reason of the two military expeditions the first in July and the second now terminated the Sarhad is now clear both of Yar Mohammedzais and Gamshadzais as tribes. It therefore stands to reason that the object of General Dyer’s first entry into the Sarhad has been accomplished and that the line of communications from Merui onwards is secured from Damani attacks provided a force remains in occupation at Khwash. To operate further against the Damanis involves operating within Baranzai spheres of influence which is wholly against the spirit of any mili tary actions sanctioned across this border and which must seriously affect the very much higher political issues which are now exercising the minds of the Government of India, while such operations as have already taken place, with the widespread feeling that General Dyer has intentions beyond the Damani sphere has shown so much distrust as to greatly harass Keyes in his mission. There are ample grounds for this mistrust, as there is no doubt that General Dyer did not grasp the larger political situation and though he says he merely made the statement in chaff, he did actually ask Jahind if he were prepared to assist him in an attack on Bampur, and this statement is now being used with full effect. I have myself never ceased in all advice I have given to General Dyer to urge the necessity of confining his operations solely to the Damanis and to point out that once they leave their own country no further action can be taken against them until such time as Government have been able to declare their future policy regarding the whole of this part of the country and I am sure that General Dyer now recognises this and is acting accordingly. He has told me several times that he will not act outside the Damani country without direct orders from the Chief of the General Staff. Thus as the Damanis have now fled their country the only possible future policy is to keep a force in Khwash, and for the present to refrain from any further operations unless of course the Damanis become emboldened and return to their country and give trouble. I further believe that this occupa tion in itself will have far reaching effects. The time is quickly coming when the Damanis will yearn to return to their homes—the grazing of their sheep during the cold weather and the sowing of their crops will demand this. To sum up beyond the keeping of a force in Khwash capable of striking in and around Khwash if found necessary no further active military opera tions should be undertaken until the Government’s future policy is absolutely cut and dry. As to the Sarhaddi Levies, I am of opinion that they have been far too hastily raised without any thought being given to the future. There are now 309 enlisted men—two-thirds being Reki and one-third Ismaelzais. When I arrived in Kb wash I found they were about to be armed with Lee- Metford rifles and ammunition—no thought whatever having been given to security for the same or to the very probable chance of our finally quitting the country and resuming our old boundary. At present our hold on the Rekis and Ismaelzais is at the best temporary and very shadowy at that. It is impossible to move about the country where the levies would be situated except under strong escort and there is no guarantee of any sort to show that these tribes have enlisted for any other reason beyond the desire to draw money10 and pay while they have the opportunity, and also because prevailing circum stances suggest enlistment to be a wise course. I can find no reason to believe in their loyalty should we leave the country—nor at present can I see how we can maintain any corps composed of these tribes unless we are actually in possession or occupation of the country which they inhabit. Above all we should certainly not embark on schemes which are unable to survive if our policy undergoes a change. Such schemes besides being expensive and putting difficulties in the way of the Government must result in breaking faith with the tribes and alienating them from us when we leave their country. What has already been done cannot now be easily altered, that is to say, we must continue keeping the men for the present in employ and to give some return for their pay they are employed in a variety of ways where it is possible to do so. I previously reported that General Dyer had not entered into any agreement as to length of service—but he tells me he feels sure that he promised them service for three years—Shakar Khan on the other hand says that no such agreement has been made ; he will look up his papers when we get to Khwash, at any rate if the agreement has been made and we find the corps is not to be raised I am afraid that the agreement cannot stand. It is a case in point to show the absolute necessity of going slow. Previous haste has made matters so confused that the whole question is one which I must reserve for discussion with the Agent to the Governor-General when I can get back to Quetta. For the present I only require the pay and the small office staff I have already asked for. 374 Dated Khwash, the 26th August 1916 (Secret). From-—The General Officer Commanding, Sistan, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. . ^ k ave th 0 honour to forward you my appreciation of the situation, asked for m your telegram No. 68889, dated 31st July 1916. When I arrived at Robat on March 3rd, I realized that what I had come out to prevent happening was really then in the process of happening, merely letters sent by certain Germans to the Damanis had been sufficient to induce them to raid our lines of communications, that if vigorous measures were not immediately taken in this direction the actual presence of Germans in the Sarhad and m the Bampur district would immediately raise a much larger storm in Persian Baluchistan. Considering that the Russians were coming southwards, and that the Germans had been ousted from Kerman, I considered that the line between Birjand and Robat was fairly secure against Germans attempting to get through there, especially in view of the water difficulties in the summer across the Dasht- i-Lut. On the other hand, though only a few roads are shown on the map con- nee ting the Narmashir and Bampur districts with the line Nasratabad-Sibi- Deham Baghi-Robat-Saindak-Mushki Chah, &amp;c., I was informed that there were hundreds of others where a few men at a time could cross without any great water difficulties. That no Germans have tried to cross from Afghanistan into Bampur or Narmashir is, I think, due to the fact that I have created a belt or friendly territory enclosed in the rectangle Khwash-Mirjawa-Robat- Gurg Fort (in the Rud-Mahi). Recently various reports have been received that Germans have appeared in the direction of Chaharburjak on the Helmund and then turned northwards, which may indicate that they do not like crossing the zone I speak of. * never f or a moment of what I am out here for, and I laboured with the Ismaiizais centred at Galugan, the Rekis, and the Damanis to se0 ure what I considered by far the most vulnerable area of the line I had to ue end, not only with a view to preventing Germans from crossing, but also for securing my lines of communication.Future events and the cold weather coming on may render it necessary for me to look to the security of the Northern Line, and this I am watching for as carefully as I can. Meanwhile the Damanis have been driven out of their fastnesses in the Morpish and Safed Koh Eanges and are not likely to interfere with my line of communications while my present force is at Khwash. Bahramf Khan of Bampur appears to be a doubtful factor who either pretends to be or is frightened at my making a fort at Khwash, which fort after all is merely an entrenched camp defensible by a small force, thus releasing my movable column for active operations. Bampur can be dealt with in the future, so long as he does not take active measures against me. But I wonder if it is wise to allow Major Keyes to continue with his peaceful mission in Southern Persian Baluchistan. Any money he may give in that direction will certainly go towards the purchase of arms, and peaceful overtures merely embolden Bahram Khan, who in any case whenever the opportunity arises, will be actively opposed to us. At present, I understand, I am not only not to attack him, but X must not attack the Damanis in the Koh-i-Birg lest I should offend Buhram Khan. As to whether the Koh-i-Bir°- is in Bampur district or not, I cannot say. Major Keyes has given it as his opinion that it is not in the Sarhad, and that my attacking Damanis in the Koh-i-Birg would bring on a collision with the Baranzais. If I were in a position to feed Major Keyes’ force, or if he could feed himself, I should like to bring his force to Khwash or possibly to Gusht, but I cannot feed Keyes nor is he at present able to subsist at Gusht, so that the best place for him at present is at Sib. Wire No. 17X3-1., dated August 17th, of Officer Commanding, Kacha, addressed Chief of the General Staff and repeated General Officer Commanding, Khwash, says that Consul thinks that if Turks take Tehran, Sistan will be invaded by Afghanistan. This sounds alarming, but I think Afghanistan would in that case be fully occupied in defending themselves against India, and that any attempt against Nasratabad would not be of a nature that I could not deal with, but I propose going to see the Consul, and from thence perhaps on to Birjand to get some knowledge of the country in that direction. I think it is premature to make any movements of troops now to meet what may never happen. As regards my line of communications from Nuski to Bohat, a new danger appears to have arisen ; Afghan raiders have made raids on the convoys leaving Nushki, and retired into sanctuary across the border, in the same manner as Jiand did into Baranzai territory. I have said nothing about Birjand and the Bussian to the north, as my time has been fully occupied in the Sarhad, and consequently I have had no opportunity of properly appreciating the situation in that direction. The greatest difficulty, I have to contend with, is that of the Supply and Transport. The camels throughout the line have of necessity been over-worked, nor do I anticipate any cessation of such work in the future. I must either have a constant influx of fresh camels from India numbering about 300 a month or very speedy arrangements must be made to open a light railway to Robat as soon as possible. A veterinary officer with a knowledge of trie treatment of camels and a plentiful supply of medicines would I am sure be a great saving to Government. Dated Khwash, the 27th August 1916 (Secret). From—The General Officer Commanding, Sistan, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. I have the honour to forward herewith a memorandum received from my Political Adviser, Major Hutchinson. I presume that I am to proceed with the training of the 200 Rekis and 100 Ismailzais raised by me, as I was ordered to raise them after all necessary consideration of the authorities.The Reids have done me invaluable service ever since I marched for Khwash on April 4th. They have made everlasting enemies of the Damanis and it will not be lightly, I trust, that they will be abandoned to the tender mercies of these enemies. I think it is absolutely necessary for these levies to have a Khaki safa and coat, as beyond 1,000 yards it is quite impossible to distinguish them from the enemy, and the eager Hazara Pioneers are very ready with their rifles to shoot anything in the semblance of an enemy. The Rekis are to be trusted, as they have too much to lose if things do not go well with us, and they would be a most valuable asset to my small fighting force in case I may be called upon to undertake operations on a larger 8(Tale. °The Ismailzais are not so well known to me, but their training cannot be carried out at present, as they are all out watching for Germans according to my orders along the Rud-lViahi line. I should be glad if you would ask the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor- General in Baluchistan to give Major Hutchinson definite orders on this matter, as Captain Wickham, Central India Hors who is supposed to be training the levies, does not understand clearly what is required of him, and consequently the efforts from the administrative side are distinctly unsatis factory. No arrangements have so far been made for feeding, clothing or paying the levies, who have thus far been paid by me from secret service money and fed either with Government rations, or from wheat captured from the Damanis and ground locally by the Khwashi women. Sarhadi Levies. The situation on my arrival at Kkwash was as follows:— Two hundred Rekis and 100 Ismailzais had been enlisted and Captain Wickham and Lieutenant Ward appointed to carry on their training while I was responsible for their administration. Dour hundred Lee-Enfield rifles bad arrived at Kacha for the Corps. My primary considerations naturally were :— (1) What is the policy of the Government of India as regards the country from which the levies have been enlisted ? (2) What hold have we over the men enlisted if it is not intended to occupy the Sarhad permanently ? At that time the Government of India had not declared its policy—nor indeed has it yet been able to do so—but as a result of the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General’s discussion in Simla and Mr. Grant’s note on the memorandum written by Sir John Ramsay it is clear that the probable policy on which I must work is that there is no intention of any permanent occupa tion of the Sarhad and that after the war we shall fall back to our former boundary. In these circumstances it follows that any hold we have over the Rekis and Ismailzais must also be of a temporary nature and is merely the outcome of our present occupation of the country necessitated by our military measures against the Damanis. With the departure of the military force from Khwash our influence and hold over the Ismailzais and Rekis disappears. Our present influence by its very nature is, therefore, not only temporary but exceedingly shadowy and it is the appreciation of this fact which has inclined me to proceed so cautiously and slowly in the development of training of what is now known as the Sarhadi Levy Corps. I am of opinion — (n) That all enlistments both of the Rekis and Ismailzais must be looked upon as temporary—that is to say that their service is a month to month service and ceases with our present military occupation of the Sarhad. (6) That for the pay they receive, the conditions of their service should be that each man should produce his rifle and his camel and be prepared to carry out ail duties which ordinarily fall to levies— such as accompanying the General Officer Commanding with hisregular force if so required, helping to maintain the dak service between Khwash and Saindak, acting as special messengers and the such like. If it is impossible to raise 300 men amongst the Kiekis and Ismadzais who can find their own rifles and camels then 1 hold that it is better to maintain a smaller number of men fulhlhng these conditions and the remainder of those enlisted should each provide himself with a riding camel—these latter carrying out duties where a rifle would not be required. I realise the difficulty of using any levies in conjunction with regulars without a distinctive mark to separate them in the eyes of sepoys from the enemy. For this purpose those possessing ^ rifles probably require a khaki safa and a khaki uniform coat. (c) Our hold on the Eekis and Ismailzais being such as it is and their absolute propinquity to the Afghanistan border and other tribes in Fersia where a small bore magazine rifle commands a very •a 1 aTn averse to them bein g armed with theLee-Enfield rifle under any circumstances. Such experience as I have had nas shown me that it is not safe to give any man a small bore rifle on this border without first taking heavy security, and even m the Chagai Levy Corps where every man is recruited within our borders and has all his interests therein it is necessary to take Ks 200 security for each rifle—though they are Martini-Henry Larbmes. In the present case every man lives across the border and the rifle with which it is proposed to arm him can fetch the best part of Rs. 1,000. It is suicidal to give any opportunity to our enemies or to men who in these troublous and changing times may easily become our enemies of acquiring a high class arm of precision which might at any time be used against us. Faking a long view and having regard to the actual number of times that we are likely to receive any material benefit by reason of the levies being armed with this high class weapon I venture to suggest that it is a wiser and more profitable policy not to put so big a temptation in their path, and that it is advisable in view of their temporary employment to maintain the levies as an irregular force on the lines suggested above. It does not appear sound to embark on a more ambitious scheme of forming a regular Lew Corns which would not survive our evacuation of the Sarhad and would, therefore bring about a situation likely to cause disappointment and misgivings amongst the very tribes whose assistance and co-operation we are now accepting. 3 376 Telegram R., No. 702-S., dated the 26th September 1916.

Protocol of the interrogatory of the German subject y Wilhelm Paschen, Captain in the 89th Begiment of the German Army, 31st July 1916. “ I arrived in Persia about one year and three months ago hy Baghdad, Kasr-i-Shirin and Kermanshah. There were 12 of us : Captain Niedermeyer, Lieutenant Hentig, Captain Wagner, Lieutenant Pocht (Vogt), Lieutenant Beyer, Military Surgeon Niedermeyer, Acting Consul at Ispahan, Seiler, Lieutenant Pasehen of the 89th Begiment (my brother), Lieutenant Winklemann, Dr. Bekker, and a Turkish officer Captain Kazim Beg. We came to Persia in order to pass through to Afghanistan, to which country we were entrusted with a Mission hy the German Emperor and the Sultan of Turkey. Seven of us reached Afghanistan, i.e., Niedermeyer (Captain), Hentig, Wagner, Eocht, Beyer, and Kazim Beg. Of the others, my brother returned to Baghdad with the German Mission, and the remainder attempted to proceed southwards in Persia through Kerman and I have no idea what has become of them. We seven all reached Afghanistan together. We knew that the Bussians had placed outposts to prevent our passage to Afghanistan, and therefore sent on three of the Austrians ahead as scouts towards Kain. These scouts were driven away by the Bussians. In our party there were nltogether 80 persons, counting Austrian soldiers, Persian sowars, servants and others. We obtained the Persian from Tehran. We and our guides were provided by the Persian Government with papers and documents. Niedermeyer obtain all these documents, as the greater part of our party accompanied him to Tehran from Kermanshah, in order to obtain the neces sary papers, and the rest of us travelled direct from Kermanshah to Ispahan where we met the Tehran contingent, Erom Ispahan we marched together via Nain, Anarak, Tabas, Bushruyeh (where we halted for two weeks) thence to Duhuk Sheileh, Kazal, Durush, Takhtavan, and Yezdan. The Persian authorities assisted us saying that Persia was a neutral country and therefore passage was free to all. However we asked for no special assistance as we were well provided, and paid for such necessaries as we required on a generous scale. At Tabas I saw the Governor, Imad-ul-Mulk, but I do not remember the names of other Governors. I can only say that all Governors between Ispahan and’the Afghan frontier came out to meet us and declared themselves our friends: they would probably do as much for you if you were passing that way. When our Austrian patrol was at Kain, the Governor of Sistan (Shaukat-ul-Mulk) sent a telegram to ask for wBat purpose they were there and why they had armed people with them, to which the patrol answered that they were going to Afghanistan and were armed for self-defence. “We sent our baggage and cash on ahead with some Austrian scouts, with the idea that if we met with resistance from the Bussians we should be able to make our way through singly to Afghanistan, where we should find our baggage awaiting us. Unfortunately there were no officers with these scouts and when attacked the men were able to save nothing. Among the baggage was specie to the amount of £600 sterling, and Tumans 18,000—nine packs of Tumans 2,000 each. Erom Tezdan we proceeded to Para and thence to Herat. Eive khans and a number of sowars were sent from Herat to meet us as our arrival had been communicated to the Afghans from Germany and Turkey two months previusly. We remained at Herat for eight days, after which I returned to Ispahan by the same road in order to deliver a letter to Seiler. I returned to Derat again from Ispahan, the journey, going and returning, having occupied about two months. When I returned to Herat our party was already at Kabul. I was ordered to remain at Herat and sub sequently never proceeded to Kabul. I can say nothing of the object of our journey to Afghanistan although you in all probability know that it was to .involve Afghanistan in .the war. The (Amir was then^ and probably is now,16 disposed to join in the war, but be demanded the fulfilment of certain con ditions (I cannot say what these were) from Germany and Turkey. “ Now all officers wish to leave Kabul, as one day the Amir says he is for us and the next against us. Twice before this Niedermeyer had made up his mind to leave, but each time the Amir detained him by giving positive assurances, but again backed out of them. Before my departure from Herat I received a letter from Niedermeyer saying there was no hope and that we must all leave. I left for Ispahan, but I do not know if they have left or not. Niedermeyer also stated in his letter to me that the Amir was unwilling to let them go in case circumstances should change and Afghanistan should declare war, in which case they—the German officers—would be necessary to him. “ On leaving Herat I obtained the consent of the Governor, but declined any pass as the mirza might talk about it to others and the British Agent would also come to know of it, in which case I might be cought by the Bussian Cossacks at Kariz or the British mounted troops. “ At Herat I saw 13 Austrian escaped prisoners, and it is said that there are over 50 of them at Kabul. “ From Herat I rode by Daulatabad, near Turbat-i-Shaikb Jam, and passed three farsakhs to the south of Turbat-i-Haidari, thence to Inzi, whence I struck the main track from Turshiz to Tabas. (I omitted to say that from Berlin an Indian Prince, with whose name I am not acquainted, accompanied us to Afghanistan.) “ On this last occasion I was accompanied by my Turkish servant and interpreter Ismail and by another servant, also a Turk, named Amin. At Tabas I, together with my two servants and a chance Persian guide, was arrested. Ismail escaped at Tabas, after which the remaining three of us were sent to Bushruyeh, and handed over there to Cossacks. Two days later, i.e.t one stage before Tun, my servant Amin and the Persian guide escaped. “ I may add that the terms on which the Amir consented to take part in the . N.B.-U* actually said si*. war we r® es P osed in a lon S c ypher tele- gram of ten* pages, despatched to Berlin if I am not mistaken in February of the current year. When I twice pro ceeded to Isfahan and to Tehran, I followed the following route: from Yazdan to Duhuk, Tabas, Shurab, and Pulband, but there were .Russians about and I was obliged to turn off southwards. I returned by the same route. The second time, when going to Tehran, I travelled by Kuhsan to Sharifabad whence I proceeded by the main road in post-waggon. On my return journey I again passed by the post-road to Sharifabad, and thence by Kuhsan.” WILLIAM PASCHEN. The above is the exact translation of Paschen’s statement, taken down in my presence by a Secretary of the Bussian Consulate-General. It is not a matter of very great importance, but he distinctly stated that he had twice gone to Ispahan from Herat and once to Tehran and I so reported it originally. It appears, however, possible that he counted the journey on which he was captured as his second journey to Ispahan. Paschen told us that his journey to Tehran took place in December of last year and that the “ Contract,” of the contents of which he was ignorant,, was sent io Berlin last February, but he has since stated otherwise to the Bussian Military Agent who has interrogated him on several occasions and who states that each time he becomes more talkative. He last stated that he left Herat on the 18th December for Tehran where he handed the “ Contract ” to his brother for conveyance to Berlin. Of the detailed contents he was unaware, but he professed to know (possibly he had heard from JN iedermeyer) that in it the Amir haa bound himself to— (1) fortify Kabul and a number of frontier points in accordance with the demands of German officers; (2) increase the establishment of the army ; (3) introduce a new system of organization on the advice of Niedermeyer.18 ■■ come straight to Herat when released. I remained with him till he beam the others were to come to Herat from Kabul. On this I asked the servants who these could he as originally only Paschen and Wagner were with me at Tahas. They told me one was Niedermeyer, and the other the son of a Minister . Two months later some Austrians reached Herat from Kabul, and we heard that Niedermeyer and the Minister’s son had fled towards Cbakansur on their way to Herat. Before this, however, Paschen had heard from the Germans at Kabul and had fled by ni^ht. I was the first to report this to the IN aib-ul-Hukumat, who replied that it did not concern him, and that Paschen could go where he liked When Wagner with some Austrians reached Herat he told me to take 2 persons to Tehran. Three days later he summoned me and I found 2 Indians wdth him with whom he conversed in English. ^ He told me that these were the persons I was to take charge of. I asked him where I should find him after the journey and he told me to return to Herat where he intended to remain. I led the 2 Indians and their servant via Gulran-Qarabagh, Hahna-i- Zulfiqar to Jamrud where we were arrested.

I was only there six days and during that time never visited nor saw the Germans. 1 met Mirza Agha by chance in the bazar and engaged him as guide to Meshed at 3 krans per diem. We accom panied him via Kuhsan, Qarabagh, Dahna-i-Zulfiqar to Mir Baqi Sultan s place at Qala Gak in Jamrud. To all the questions put to us there we said we were going to Meshed on pilgrimage and had missed our way. Mir Baqi Sultan visited us and to his questions we gave the same reply. He suspected us of being connected with the Germans and wished to search us, but on our assurances he desisted. We told him we had a rahdari. He disclaimed further responsibility regarding us but told us we were likely to he arrested further on on suspicion of being German agents. With the idea of escaping arrest we made towards Meshed from Qala Gak, but at Kalata-i-Sufi were arrested and taken to Kariz. It will be noted that these two statements differ in several essential particulars, and that there are also discrepancies between Paschen s and Mirza Agha’s statement. The formal enquiry will be held at Turbat-i- liaidari. Meshed \ h E. A. E. Bedl, Lieut.-Colonel, The 25th August 1916.

According to telegram from Gough sent from camp one stage from Abadeh, Soulet-ed-Dowleh now declines to send prisoners except on Persian Government’s orders, and 45 of his gendarmerie escort have deserted with three officers and are said to have joined Kashgai. As Gough has always believed in loyalty of gendarmerie on road, this latter news is disquiet- ing. Attitude of Governor of Abadeh is also dubious. In opinion of Consul- General, Ispahan, road in the neighbourhood of Yezdikhast is so unsafe that to ensure safety of prisoners an escort considerably greater than the 100 mea Gough suggests would be requisite, and Sykes is not in a position to furnish this. I think that in these circumstances plan of sending prisoners from Shiraz must be abandoned especially as Persian Government is averse from it though rather on the ground that embarrassment would be caused by their passage throughTehran later.

Following telegram from Minister at Tehran, September 14th :— Begins. Although Kawam and company protest loudly that their quarrel is solely with Farman Farma I am not by any means sure that conspiracy is not also directed against Sykes’ mission in Pars and it will in my opinion be impossible until situation is much clearer for Gough and Farman Farma to proceed thither. I have so informed Gough and have also sent instructions to Kawam that prisoners are to remain at Shiraz and that he will be held responsible for them. Gough is asking very urgently for money to be sent to him under escort. Can this be arranged ? If so, I can remit 15,000 tomans he asks for to Ispahan. Addressed to Ispahan; repeated to Sykes. Ends. Consul-General, Ispahan, hopes to arrange that money should be paid to Gough in Abadeh. 307 Telegram P., No. 609-F., dated the 14th (received 15th) September 1916. From—The British Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Any definite decision as to instructions to be given to Sykes seems prema ture until we again hear from Gough. Unless events take very decided change in Fars, however, we must apparently abandon for the present idea of taking action there and must look rather to utilizing our force in connection with Bakhtiari and Ispahan problems, bearing in mind that Farman Farma and Gough themselves may have to be relieved. That move in Shiraz is directed as much against Sykes’ mission as against Farman Farma’s Governorship is my strong suspicion. Addressed to London Foreign Office; repeated to Basrah.310 Telegram R., No. 682-C., dated (and received) the 16th September 1916. Irom— Brigadier-General Sir P. M. Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated Chief of the General Staff, Tehran, Basrah, Gou^h and Kennion). Clear the line. Russian authority consider that Column has joined Baratoff’s army and that it should not leave neighbourhood of Ispahan until retreat of Turks accomplished fact. I concur entirely. They consider depar ture of column almost in light of desertion. I have discussed question with Noel and have no hesitation in proposing that column should proceed to Chahar Mahal to support friendly Bakhtiaris and attack Bakhtiari Khans of German party. Arrangements would be made for co-operation with Russians both in case of Turkish advance and in dealings with local bands. Action calculated to aid situation in Bars and especially in Oil Fields. Russian military author ities agree that there is no tactical objection to scheme. If agreed to, Baratoff should presumably be informed. 311 Telegram R., No. 8-F., dated the 16th (received 17th) September 1916. From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir H. Gough, Abadeh, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated Minister, Basrah, Bushire and Sykes). Clear the line. Reference Sykes’ telegram No. 623 (632 ?), September 16th. I venture to place my views before Government for consideration— (1) Unless Government consider Russian position so critical that Sykes’ force (I understand less than 500 men) is necessary to safety of position at Ispahan he should, in my opinion, move on Shiraz as soon as possible to restore situation there: (2) Abandonment of his move might he considered almost in light of desertion of our interests and responsibilities in Fars : (3) My start for Shiraz was sanctioned only on supposition that my position would be supported by early move of Sykes’ column which Minister repeatedly stated he considered essential: (4) Abandonment of move will probably mean complete anarchy in prov ince which will require much larger force in future to subdue : (5) It very probably also means release of prisoners now in Shiraz : and (6) Finally gendarmerie unless paid and reorganised soon will form very dangerous element in province. 312 Telegram P., No. 40-F., dated (and received) the 16th September 1916.

Farman Farma and Gough reached Abadeh safely yesterday. Kashgai Governor gave them good reception. My suspicion that Soulet and Kawam are animated by determination to oppose formation of military police under Sykes largely owing to dislike of Farman Farma is confirmed by information in Gough’s possession. I fear that in these circumstances we must for the present abandon hope of Sykes reaching Shiraz.

According to telegraph messages from the British Agent it has been evident since the beginning of the Turbat-i-Haidari interrogation that prisoners, Muhammad Tunis and Muhammad Hussein, have been trying every means to avoid being sent to India. British Agent caught a glimpse of a document they have written to the Bussian Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari of which he made no mention. It appears from what he says to be identical with one just received from the same two persons through the Russian Agent, Karez, by the Russian Military Agent which I have hastily read. It is in good English.

Farman Parma urged me this morning to express to you his conviction that exchange of Governors, Kerman and Pars, is the best solution. Of course he may change his views, but I agree with his present attitude expressed above. Telegrams are pouring in on me from Shiraz from all sorts of sources assuring me (as they have from the beginning) that opposition is to Parman Parma and his deputy only and not against us in any way. The sources are so varied it is impossible to think that they do not represent general opinion. They all urge that we should trust Kawam and go on with him personally to Shiraz and I really believe that we might perfectly safely do so if exchange of Governors is effected. We would in any case have to wait here eight days or so while money is being sent from Ispahan. I can only get insignificant sum here and Grahame can arrange to send it to Kumisha up to which place Sykes, I hope, will provide escort while I will send men from here to meet it.

Pack Wireless section 3 stations. (Temporary) 2 companies, 106th Pioneers. Their distribution as known here is shewn on the attached map, and is detailed in Dy. No. 76704, of which a copy is included in the papers men tioned in paragraph 5 of these orders. Major Keyes, Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, with the Mekran Mission (regular escort of 2 companies, 127th Baluchistan Infantry, and 50 rifles, l-7th Gurkhas, under command of Captain Harvey Kelly, 127th Baluchis) is at present at Sib. The future action of this Mission is at present under consideration of the Poreign and Political Department. Should your operations require the co-operation of this force, you will inform me for consideration as to placing it under your control for operations. Meanwhile you should seek Major Kej es* opinion and advice in political matters relating to Bampur and Mekran. The line of communications of your force from Nushki to Bobat is under the orders of General Officer Commanding, Quetta Division, and is adminis tered by a Boad Commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel C. A.

Instructions dealing with these orders were to the following effect Although you should keep in the closest touch with the Consul, Sistan, and consult him regarding the situation and the measures necessary to effect the object in view, you alone are responsible for deciding on military measures to be taken. You should co-operate with the Russians and act as you consider necessary to close the roads which the hostile parties might use, keeping in mind, however, the undesirability of having numerous small detachments. A good system of intelligence, furnishing early intimation of any movements of hostile parties and thereby enabling counter-measures being taken in good time from a central point, should go a considerable way towards obviating the necessity for detailing permanent detachment to watch various roads. 8«e also telegram from O, C., Nasratabad, to C.

So long as Persia maintains her neutrality, every endeavour must be made to act in a manner friendly to the Persians and in support of the Persian authorities. Persian subjects should not be interfered with, unless they are escorting hostile parties or unless there is reason to believe that they are carrying despatches for the Germans. Any suspicious traveller should he examined. Throughout your operations it must be borne in mind that small detach ments are specially liable to attack and that even a slight reverse would have serious consequence as regards our prestige. Small detachments are, therefore, to be avoided as much as possible. Your predecessor was forced by hostility on the part of various Sarhaddi tribes, and raids by them on his convoys to move southwards into their country and take retaliatory action. The permanent occupation of any area beyond our present border is not intended and all arrangements you make should, therefore, be of an entirely temporary nature. The presence of regular troops in Sarhad may be necessary for some time, but the Government of India desire to withdraw the troops as soon as the Germans have been dealt with and political arrangements made for the control of the border.Since the capture of the German parties re-entering Persia from Afghanis tan is still your main object, His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief considers that your headquarters should be located, as soon as possible, in the Robat-Saindak-Kacha area, as this will enable you to supervise arrangements for this object and facilitate at the same time consultation with both your political advisers and colleagues. Your political advisers and colleagues are :— In Sistan and Kain : Lieutenant-Colonel E. B. Prideaux, C.I.E., H. B. M.’s Consul for Sistan and Kain ; Eor Sarhad : in addition to his other duties as Political Agent, Chagai, Major W. G. Hutchinson. You will keep in the closest touch on political matters with the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. 5. Copies of correspondence which has passed between Army Head quarters and other authorities and your predecessor are attached for your information and guidance. 6. When possible you will send daily telegraphic reports to the Chief of the General Staff, repeating them to the General Officer Commanding, 4th (Quetta) Division, and when necessary to the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. 7. Cipher books for your use, of which the General Officer Commanding, 4th Division, has a copy are in possession of General Dyer, and all messages enquiring enciphering to General Officer Commanding, 4th (Quetta) Division, and to the Chief of the General Staff will be sent in this cipher.

I shall retain, here at least one brother. Letter from Merrill just received says that he sent offer to Hussain Khan of immunity if he brings in prisoners on August 30th. I am urging him to withdraw other offers he has made which conflict with notification issued from here.

General Nearod informs me that he has telegraphed asking whereabouts of force ordered to return to Pizabad. This force has been increased by one squadron making total now four squadrons and one gun to cover General Baratoff’s left and patrol as far south as Sultanabad- Paulatabad Bead. If they are pressed they will fall back along Kum Road and might be reinforced from Kum and Kerrij if necessary up to 15 squadrons. He says that he is asking that one squadron should be stationed at Sultanabad. Staff believe enemy force at Paulatabad to be small. If this correct, I suggest if the Russians could occupy Paulatabad it would facilitate negotia tions with Lurs and at same time place Russians in position threaten Turk line of communications at Kangavar.

Except undor stimulus of Shiraz news and distortion of that from Ispahan general detection of local tribes seems to me now unlikely, owing to lapse of time coupled with failure of tribes to join Hussein Khan. Least movement ot troops from here and Baft on Sirjan should have very salutary effect. Column was at Galugah on night of September 8th according to reports received from Bahadur-ul-Mulk of Mashiz and success was attending negotia tions approved by me to induce Qarai and Luri tribes to clear pass of Hussein's men and hold it in favour of column.

My telegram No. 597. _ Telegram from Gough reports that Soulet and Kawam accept proposal to deliver over German prisoners. Kawam is to bring them under a gendarmerie escort. Gough proposes to meet them two stages south of Dehbid, and is quite satisfied as to Kawam's hona fides. Beadiness of Soulet and Kawam to relinquish so valuable an asset as prisoners seem to me to show that they do not wish to oppose us and that their grievance is really against Earman Earma's appointment. Earman Earma is also ready to remain at Dehbid. If he had doubts of Soulet's and Kawam’s sincerity he would not do so. I have warned Gough to inform Kawam and particularly Soulet that so long as prisoners are in Kashgai territory they will be held responsible for their safety, no matter who is escorting them. To ensure safe custody of prisoners I would strongly urge that Sykes who is due to reach Ispahan in a day or two should be directed to send suitable party say 100 men south to take them over.

I understand that 3,000 camel-loads of supplies including bhoosa are ^ sent from Sistan to Khwash monthly. There are only 2,000 Government transport camels for whole force, many of which are retained at outposts in readiness for movements. Supply contractor is using much local transport collecting grain and bhoosa from villages which are inaccessible in winter. This work cannot be interfered with at this season. Three hundred and fifty camels are dying monthly, partly for lack of \ resting days, and partly on account of length of marches. Camels cannot march more than 15 miles per day and retain health. It seems imperative that camels be maintained in sufficient numbers to allow of animals resting in rotation or that strength of force at Khwash be reduced. I am asking Meshed and Kerman whether camels can be sent. Cannot they be obtained in Sarhad. It would be easing situation if some cavalry could return to Robat. If a squadron could be sent to Bam perhaps Kerman could also ration them. In the last resort could not cavalry be again mounted on riding camels and their horses be sent to Sistan or return to India.

General position according to Russian Consul slightly changed for worse, but according to Kennion no change. Gough telegraphed, September 11th, for me to send a hundred and fifty men to take over 60 German and other prisoners at Abadeh. I replied that I must await instructions and that Consul-General, Ispahan, considered that entire column would be required for this duty. I concur as there are bands of brigands, several hundred strong, on road. Suggested that Gough delay departure of prisoners pending your instructions on point of escort and explained that he was forcing your hands as to employment of column if prisoners reach him, and he could not arrange escort Ispahan. March column towards Shiraz and return would have very bad political effect. Noel, who is due Ispahan, September 14tb, proposes column should attack Bakhtiari fort 70 miles south-west. Consul-General wishes convoy held up 7 miles west to be escorted in. Refit will take ten days—boots and clothing being worn out. Suggest delay of final decision for a few days except as regards escort of prisoners.

Very farming reports, dated August 25th, were received from Merrill yesterday According to him all Sirjan is against us. He says that he has no doubt that Sardar Nusrat and his brother are responsible for the prisoners , escape and that th&lt;^ are busily organising general revolt aganist us in event of success of Turks ? Reviewing all the probabilities and facts of the case I largely discount former and disbelieve latter report—Merrill is an excitable American and his interpreter is an enemy of the Sardar. He demands re- intorcements at once from every direction in order to hold district. Until prisoners are recovered (if ever), situation is certainly very serious (sic ?). Tarran meanwhile has sent orders with my concurrence to up coming column to await M agstaff’s arrival at Baft. After getting all available information Wagstatt, if he considers that it is advisable, will leave specie and arms and ammunition with guard of 100 rifles in Baft fort and proceed to Sinan with rest of column about 130 strong. This is a Pis AUer arrangement. I do not know when Wagstaff, who left Bunder Abbas on August 20th, expects to reach Baft, as he has infantry with him.

Sykes appears to have taken decision as to his movements out of the hands of His Majesty's Government when on or after August 18th he moved supplies from Yezd-Dehbid to Yezd* Ispahan route. His having been able to do so seems inconsistent with state ment as to insecurity of road for his own column. As regards last paragraph of Sykes' telegram just repeated to you it appears to me that abandonment of original plan indicated by transfer of supplies is more injurious to our prestige than by reverting to it. Without knowing what arrangements can be made on Ispahan-Shiraz road I cannot now express opinion whether Sykes can reach Shiraz quicker by that route or by Dehbid. Passage of Barman Parma should have made former safe but may make question of supplies difficult. By either route Sykes can scarcely reach Shiraz in five weeks. I trust, however, that Sykes will be instructed to keep me informed in future before he takes measures calculated to commit us in question still under discussion. I think Gough and Parman Parma can, nevertheless, proceed in view of friendly attitude of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, but I am informing Gough of inevitable ■delay.

This course was suggested by the British and Russian local authorities at Ispahan, but so far it has not been concurred in by Tehran, whose latest wish however was for Sykes to proceed to Shiraz, not halting at Tezd, vide Tehran’s 532-R. to Poreign Office, dated 16th instant. The following are the advantages of Sykes* proposed move to Ispahan:— Firstly .—Concentrating with Russians who are said to have some 600 sabres, 1,400 rifles and four guns in the area Kum-Sultanabad-Ispahan. Secondly .—The advantages mentioned in your 19657, dated 17th July, regarding the Bakhtiaris, which would be enhanced by fact that our shortest line of communication to Ispahan would be by way of Ahwaz and the Lynch Road. Therefore it is considered that Sykes* proposal should receive approval. In view of the fact that so long as we hold Ispahan in force we hinder German-Turkish activity in Pars, any delay in Sykes* reaching Shiraz is not so material. In the meantime Gough at Ispahan proposes to accompany Parman Parma to Shiraz with his consular escort only and without waiting for Sykes. He thinks this may steady the Shiraz situation, and considering the advantage of this it is considered any risk involved should be taken. The matter in the above sense is being referred to Secretary of State and repeated to Tehran by Poreign, India.

After a night march without baggage (?) I entered Jalk very early next morning and there captured 150 Gamshazai women and children, 6 prisoners and about 50 head of cattle, together with 10 rifles and destroyed a good deal of property belonging to Gamshazais.

My telegram No. 4359 of 30th August. Lorimer sends following :— (1) August 30th, No. 66:— Begins. My telegram 64,1 regard situation as very serious now; escaped prisoners are at Balward where Husain Khan is collecting his followers. Letters from him, dated August 25tb, have been received by Sardar Nusrat and Haji Mirza Muhammad Ali. Letter to the former represented that he had carried off prisoners to forestall a plot for their rescue and promised to obey any instructions sent him as to their disposal. Letter to the latter stated that everything done by him had been done for the cause of Islam and the Turks, and Mirza Muhammad Ali has besought to join them. The former letter is only a blind to secure delay upon our part. The crux is that everybody is full of Turkish successes, very exaggerated accounts of which are credited everywhere. The German cause is regarded as triumphant and the British Government as powerless. This they have the power to make true locally. Hence I have little hope that success will attend our present efforts to gain over Afshar and other tribes and combine them on our side. Ours is regarded as lost cause and our last asset will be gone when Sykes’ definite withdrawal from Kerman sphere becomes known. Only circumstances in our favour are {a) prisoners are reported to be flush of funds and the report will probably be found to be false, as Husain Khan is believed to have looted all the money in their possession and not likely to endow Germans with it at present stage; (5) that part of Buchaqchi tribes will probably array themselves on our side, as they are inimical to Husain Khan and stood by us last time. The Afshar, on the other hand, were against us last time and our efforts to gain them now are not likely to he successful. Ammunition convoy reached Baft on 27th safely and is probably now nearing here. It is, however, only 121 regular rifles and 2 guns and cannot affect situation of Sirjan materially. Yet if Sirjan goes, all Kerman will go, I think, closing Sykes’ lines of supplies and withdrawal. I believe major danger would by now have been over ha^ Sykes been free to march at once on Sirjan. He left, however, under orders for Ispahan on the 28th August and all I can suggest is that Dyer march (?) on here at once if situation Baluchistan and £istan at all permits and so allay the excitement. If in response to hisdemand for a brigade any reinforcements are being sent to Sykes, they cannot arrive in time materially to affect present situation. News of troops landing at Bunder Abbas, however, would be helpful and even 500 with guns, suggested an my telegram 43, would be useful. They would have to bring transport and supplies at least in part. Dribblets of 50 and 100 men are a source not of strength but of danger. Line of supplies and retreat to Ispahan will be closed and 2,000 rifles and one million rounds of ammunition will fall in hands of enemy if we lose Kerman province. That all Sirjan and tribes will go against us I cannot guarantee, but the danger is certainly serious, and as our informa tion will always be uncertain and entangled owing to distance and surveillance of enemy, we shall never know exactly what situation is at any moment. Decisive Bussian victory would pr obably save situation, but it would take considerable time to operate. JSads. (2) No. 70, dated 31st August. Officer Commanding, Kerman, shares these views.

Telegram No. 71, August 31st, from Consul, Kerman, and your telegram No. 170, August 31st. I do not consider situation as very serious. Husseiu Khan has little influence and few followers. Reinforcements should proceed to Sirjan as soon as possible from Kerman with South Persia Rifles and levies as (soon as ?) possible. There are plenty of supplies Sirjan and by this step prisoners would be less likely to escape to Pars. Bribery might he used. Action in fact should be widely advertised and local authorities warned that future depends on their present action. I am telegraphing Sardar Nusrat in this sense.WagstafPs column appears to be marching towards Sirjan in co-operation with convoy column. ConsuPs escort and details should suffice to guard arms and ammunition after arrival. Pact that Merrill is apparently able to remain Sirjan is most hopeful.

From — Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. In continuation of my letter No. 232-C., dated 29th June 1916, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a telegram which Colonel O’Connor has asked me to despatch to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, giving his views on the question of the Bushire hinterland. I am sending the telegram to Tehran, but shall refrain from commenting on it, as in the present condition of affairs in the north I cannot think that Sir C. Marling would care to be bothered with such matters. As Colonel O’Connor is proceeding to India at once and will no doubt discuss the wffiole question with you, the matter does not seem of sufficient urgency to warrant the expense of telegraphing at such length. I have, therefore, sent on the draft telegram by post, and shall inform you that it is coming. The only comment I now wish to make is to say that in my opinion Colonel O’Connor apparently does attach undue importance to the assurances of the two Khans; personally I do not think the slightest reliance can be placed on any assurances given by these rascals. I consider that the reason the people of Chahkutah and Tangistan are more reasonable now is because they have felt the pressure of the closing of the road, and see we can make things unpleasant for them. Enclosure. Telegram, No. 288—1720, dated the 21st August 1916. From— O’Connor, Bushire, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Situation in Bushire hinterland now as follows:— Settlement which has been made with Khans has given greatest satis faction to all inhabitants of previously hostile districts who were heartily siek of whole business and. who now welcome restoration of normal conditionsmarnmm Hm n—mi [|||BBT|||iMgHii'Wl and especially resumption of traffic with Bushire. The two Khans accom panied me for several miles on my journey towards Bushire yesterday and were prodigal of assurances of friendly feelings towards British and of their sincere desire to maintain friendly relations and to serve British Government in the future. They express themselves as quite indifferent to any rebel or Turkish successes elsewhere in Persia and say that they have definitely decided to throw in their lot with British and to eschew all German and other intrigues. They have been trying during last few days to get Wassmuss out of their territory, hut no one, not even his own servants, will consent to accom- pany him and he is left stranded and penniless in miserable condition among treacherous people who now regard him as responsible for all losses and misfortunes they have suffered. I do not attach undue importance to assurances of two such arrant rogues as Khans in question, but I have had unique opportunity of gauging sentiments °f Khans and people in general in those parts and I am convinced that if situation is now handled with reasonable discretion and tact there is no practical possibility of recrudescence of trouble in hinterland. There is pro bably no human being who more thoroughly realises outrageous character of Khans’ offences than myself or who would more gladly see due punishment meted out to them, but I venture to submit opinion that on grounds of common sense and expediency best policy for us to follow for present is to maintain at any rate outward forms of friendship with these two Khans leaving their punishment for such future time as may be most convenient to ourselves and Persian Government. Such course will at once relieve pressure on Bushire and will constitute best means of checkmating German intrigues in these parts. All disorderly elements within very wide radius are already much, discouraged by our settlement with Khans and beneficial effects will gradually permeate further and further inland. At same time it should be borne in mind that these people are extremely ignorant, suspicious and exciteable and great tact and care will have to be exercised for some time to come, especially if other parts of Persia are disturbed in order to avoid recrudescence of recent troubles. I may add that in my conversations with Khans I have been careful to give them no assurances of any kind beyond those agreed to in terms of settlement but I have continually impressed upon them advantages to be gained by friendship with British representatives at Bushire and have urged them to endeavour to consolidate good relations now inaugurated by mainten ance of peace and order in their own districts and by display of friendship and respect of British Government and its representatives. Addressed Tehran; repeated Foreign; copy Major Trevor. 240 No. 321-C., dated Bushire, the 21st (received 29th) August 1916 (Confidential). From— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. In continuation of my letter No. 303-C., dated 14th August 1916, and of my telegram No. 1712, dated 21st August 1916,1 have the honour to report, for the information of the Government of India, that Colonel O’Connor vas brought in last night at about 7-30 p. m. safe and well. After the receipt of your telegram 521-S , dated 12th August 1916, I telegraphed to the Government of Bombay giving details of the Tangistani prisoner Zair Hussain and the date of his departure from Basrah, &amp;c. On the 15th I received a telegram through the Brigade office here from the General Officer Commanding, Bombay Brigade, saying that Zair Hussain had left that morning in the Hospital ship “ Devanha”. I immediately wrote to the Khans stating that Zair Hussain was on Ins way and would probably reach here on the 20th or thereabouts, guaranteeing to release him on arrival, and asking the Khans to send Colonel O’Connor to Bushire in advance.8 T i 8 I was rather anxious lest the Khans should receive news of what was happening in the north and make fresh difficulties. I did not receive any answer to this letter for some days. On the 19th I received a telegram from the Master of the “ Devanha ” saying he would arrive here at 6 A. m. on the 20th, and I thereupon wrote again to the Khans asking them to ex change Colonel O'Connor in the afternoon of the 20th. No answer came to this and as Zair Hussain is still lame from his wound it did not seem worth while to send him out to the Mashileh on the off chance of Colonel O’Connor arriving. However, at about 7 P. M. I was called to the Field Telephone and found that Colonel O'Connor had rung me up from No. 10 Post, and I asked him to come up to the Kesidency at once and sent carriage to meet him. On arrival he told me that my first letter had been delayed by the absence of Zair Khidar who had gone off from Shamshiri, where Colonel O’Connor was, saying, he would be back on the 17th, whereas he didn’t come back till the 19th. When he arrived Colonel O’Connor insisted on being released on the strength of my first letter, and the Khans wrote saying they would send him over on the 21st. (This letter reached me after Colonel O’Connor had arrived.) On the way my second letter was received and Colonel O’Connor succeeded in persuading the Khans to let him come straight on. He thus arrived on the evening of the 20th instead of the morning of the 21st. One Rais Ali who had been Colonel O’Connor’s jailor and several other hangers-on of Zair Khidar came over, and Zair Hussain was banded over to them. They are taking him home this afternoon. As he is lame, I have provided a khajawah for him and provided certain ai^S^s such as a hat, umbrella and various other things he required. It has been arranged that the H. T. “ Elephanta ” shall call for Colonel O’Connor, and such of the other released prisoners as wish to go to India, on Wednesday next. I understand Colonel O’Connor intends to avail himself of the permission to take leave, but will first proceed to Simla, where he will doubtless have the honour of discussing his adventures w ith you and submitting a full report to the Government of India. 241 Telegram R., No, 88-F., dated the 2nd (received 3rd) September 1916.

We are trying arrange supply funds from local revenue. Sirjan being inadequate Husain is said to be selling gold and prisoners to be requisitioning money from Kerman. We are taking ail possible steps here. Merrill and Prince Governor accuse Sardar Nusrat and family of being privy to rescue oi prisoners and plotting general rising.

Arrangements are being made by Commandant, Kerman, to despatch reinforcements which arrived at Kerman 2nd (September) with someS. P. B. gunners to Sirjan on earliest possible opportunity. Chief of General Staff’s later orders to concentrate all forces in Kerman are impracticable, as it is impossible presumably to catch Wagstaff before he leaves Baft for Sirjan ; it is, however, essential to throw troops immediately into Sirjan even at a risk. But they will be safe enough, I think, if they do not attempt rash offensive action in hills. No levies are available here nor will any be available unless we provide arms and ammunition. This should only be done as last resource; a few gendarmerie rifles lent by Merrill have already been lost. Offers of rewards have been made long ago. The real point now at issue is extent of Husain Khan’s influence and that of prisoners. Merrill thinks his life is in constant danger and considers himself prisoner.

Reports have been received by Russian Minister from Russian General Officer Commanding to the effect that latter has had to evacuate Hamadan after an action at Asadabad in which be lost 7 guns and is now 20 versts north of Hamadan on Kasvin road at Aghboulak. There has been no persuit by Turks who are said to have 50 guns and 20 battalions of 500 men each. Regarding whereabouts of Russian reinforcements, there is no news but these include no artillery. The only defensive position is Sultan Bulagh between Kasvin and Hamadan and if it is forced which, in view of Turkish superiority in numbers, seems quite possible, Tehran would be virtually isolated by threatened cutting qf its communications at Kasvin. I should be glad of immediate instructions in view of this contingency. Three courses are apparently open to us, hut whichever course we adopt it appears essential that Shah's movements should conform with ours. 1. Eor both legations and their colonies to remain in Tehran, awaiting developments. In the event of Turks reaching capital this course though just possible for us is clearly out of question for my Russian colleague. 2. To retire to Meshed allowing our colonies to reach Astrabad by any available route, e.g., by Barforusb. Transport difficulties would be very great. 3.

Prom—B rigadieb-General Sir Percy Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Inspector-General South Persia Military Police, To—The Secretary to the Government o£ I*dia in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. I have now been at Kerman a month and it seems desirable to give some account of the political situation. 2. As already reported in my letter No. 19-P., dated 22nd June 1916, the arrival of the column restored order, partly owing to the strength it represented and partly because the Sirdar Nusrat felt himself strong enough to arrest the habitual disturbers of the peace. Prom the start the Sirdar N usrat has worked most loyally with me in the interests of law and order and from every quarter gratifying reports have been received of steady improvement. 3. The arrival of His Highness the Nusrat-u-Sultana, the favourite uncle of the Shah and an inexperienced youth of 25, threatened to upset everything. His Highness wished to dismiss the Sirdar Nusrat and to fill every office with members of his own staff. This I declined to allow and I am thankful to say that His Highness is now working well with the Sirdar Nusrat. 4. My relations with the new Governor-General were slightly difficult at first, but His Highness, who was delighted at special honours paid him on the parade held in honour of the Shah, has told me more than once that the maintenance of Kajar dynasty depends on the success of my mission and that be will help me in every way. We are at present on the best of terms and settle the affairs of the province in our committee of three without the slightest friction. 5. The more important cases of attack on British property and employes, the purchase of goods known to be British and the Bruggmann case have all been examined. In the two former series of cases, heavy fines have been imposed which will, to some extent at any rate, indemnify the sufferers. 6. The Persian authorities readily handed over Obaydulla (the Turkish Ambassador to Afghanistan), Bruggmann and two Germans. They are being sent to India under escort. I am sending Bruggmann with the other prisoners, as, although a neutral subject, he accepted the post of German Consul and acted as jackal to the Germans in their seizure of British property. It would be unwise to leave him at Kerman. The prisoners and escort will march by Sirjan and will there be joined by a German doctor, some Austrians and some Afghans, said to be deserters. The Sirdar Nusrat has helped me in every way to arrange this somewhat delicate matter. 7. The military operations of Brigadier-General Dyer have conferred distinct benefits on the inhabitants of Bam, Narmashirand Khabis which have suffered terribly from Sarhaddi raids. Bahram Khan, owing to the salutary fear inspired, is making overtures to the Persian authorities; and there is every hope that, in time, a possible arrangement can be concluded with the wild Baluch chiefs. Beports of General Dyer’s acceptance of Sarhaddis as British subjects and the alleged erection of a fort at Khwash are well known at Kerman; and, until I can authoritatively state that we are pacifying Persian Baluchistan in the interests of Persia, my position is somewhat difficult. 8. Major Farran is recruiting for the new force and although handicapped by the smallness of his staff and lack of equipment, everything is going well. Here again the assistance of the Sirdar Nusrat is most valuable. 9. In conclusion the news that the column was to leave for Pars without making any arrangements for the maintenance of order in Kerman, was received by all classes with outspoken dismay which was certainly gratifying. The arrangement sanctioned by which reinforcements are placed at my disposal for Kerman or elsewhere has been welcomed with the utmost relief. So far as the Kerman province is concerned, law and order can be maintained provided that there is strict continuity of policy, although no really satis factory state of affairs is possible until the open sale of posts at Tehran can beprevented. In Tars the problem is much more difficult and much time and study are needed but, given the necessary power and support, I am confident of ultimate success. I 10.

The question of transport presented the greatest difficulty. At Bunder Abbas only camels and donkeys ply into the interior; and owing to the heat trained camels are not brought to the port after mid April. Con sequently, moving a column carrying 40 days’ rations, 7 days’ forage and much equipment for the South Persia Military Police, with untrained camels and wholly undicisplined drivers, across the series of ranges which hold up the Iranian plateau, was a task which, apart from any chance of attack, presented many difficulties. Nor were these lessened by the fact that the column was in no sense a unit with a staff but merely small detachments of cavalry, artillery and infantry, with a field ambulance. Owing to this, from the day the troops landed at Bunder Abbas, the tiny staff of South Persia Military Police had to neglect practically everything except arrangements of every description for the column. The transport for the first echelon, consisting of the headquarters, the cavalry and the section of mountain artillery, and composed of 319 camels and 212 donkeys, was first organised. The division of the camels among units and the apportionment' of loads was extremely difficult owing to the absence of interpreters and the wholly i l Iunreasonable behaviour of the camelmen who were ready to desert without notice and whose camels were kept at least a stage away for grazing purposes. Major Hunter, the Staff Officer, aided by Mr. A. E. Wittkugel of the Indo- European Telegraph Department, who volunteered his valuable services, worked unremittingly for several days and the column was actually ready to start a few days before the date set for departure, the 17th May 1916, but it was imperative to know that the transport was available for the second echelon. This echelon commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel E. P. Twigg, 124th Ealuchis, was fortunate in having Captain Merrill with a Persian officer to manage the transport. Mr. Howson, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, rendered valuable assistance throughout. The hilly country through which the two echelons passed was fortunately friendly; in the opinion of every senior officer the long convoy could not have been effectively protected against energetic and brave raiders. To any one accustomed to travel with huge struggling herds of half-wild camels and groups of donkeys, this conclusion needs no demonstration. With trained camels too the risk would be great, apart from the necessity of providing grazing pickets which would impose a very heavy strain on the very small force of cavalry. 4. Thanks to the precaution of taking 40 days’ rations from Bunder Abbas, the column was l6ss dependant on the supplies laid out than would otherwise have been the case. It is however only due to the Persian author ities to say that they laid out supplies exactly as desired. 5. The journey falls naturally into two sections of hot country and cold country. The former was intensely hot and malarious; and the latter with camps at over 7,000 feet, brought out the fever. Horses and mules were also affected by the unfavourable conditions. Were mosquito curtains obligatory for all ranks, the considerable loss of efficiency caused by sickness would hardly have had to be recorded. In the South African War hundreds of strong capable men were unusable because dentists were not then provided. Perhaps in future, mosquito curtains, which are extremely light and cheap, may form part of a soldier’s outfit in malarious countries. 6. It is of interest to note that the last European column to traverse the Kerpian Province was that of the Alexander the Great in B. 0. 325 and that there has been no improvement in communications in the long interval of 2,241 years. Our column has been received in the most friendly way and this is of good augury for the future, but yet, compared with the area to be dominated, the column constitutes little more than a corporal’s guard. Moreover as yet no arrangements have been made to replace losses from sick ness and other causes. 7. In conclusion, Sir, I beg to report that Lieutenant-Colonel Twigg commanding the second echelon faced all difficulties with a determination to minimise them and thereby lessened my anxieties. Major Eraser Hunter, Staff Officer, South Persia Military Police, was the mainspring of the two echelons and whatever credit may be considered to be due, is mainly his. The two transport officers referred to above were invaluable in handling the refractory camel and donkey men.

The attack ^seeras to have been a very determined one, and as Maior Lorimer says, there is little doubt that the whole caravan would have been captured if it had not been straggling so much. As it was the amount of property looted was not very great. Major Lorimer appears to have had a narrow escape, and it is fortunate that he and the rest of the advanced party were able to get through the Tang without injury. It is satisfactory to note that the affair was an ordinary caravan robberv ! and not an attempt to shoot or capture British Consul due to anti-British teelmg or the instigation of enemy agents. A copy of this letter and the enclosure is being sent to Sir P. Cox. Enclosure, Telegram, dated the 30th (received 31st) July 1916. From —Major D. L. R. Lorimer, Kerman, To— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire. 9 On tlm afternoon of 14th July I left Daulatabad for camp beyond Tangi Guluianjir, I was supposed to have guard of 15 Buchaqchis but only 8 had turned up and of these though warned six did not start out with caravan; on reaching above-mentioned Tang after short halt at Burj, one mile to the east of it, I was ahead with one Buchaqchi, one police sowar, second clerk and Buchaqchi Abdari mule perhaps J mile behind were Abdul Alim and one police sowar and possibly there was one or two Buchaqchis close behind. Caravan must have been three miles in the rear when self and advance party had proceeded some distance into Tang which is very narrow and has smooth gravelly bottom. We were challenged by men on hill sides above us on either hand, we paused and I saw two men crouching on my rio'ht rear, I thought them 50 yards off. Almost at once two or three shots were fired at us and these were followed by a fusillade, place was a death trap and only chance was to get out of it, if possible, by speed, I was unarmed and there was no chance of using weapons, Buchaqchis and myself put our horses to gallop and proceeded onwards through Tang (which continued, I should think, for couple of 100 yards) under a hail of bullets at close range from both sides of Tang. which were apparently lined with men, shooting at us practically ceased when clear of Tang and we continued some J mile un pursued. Best of party had apparently not followed us and it subsequently appeared that they had immediately thrown themselves off their horses and been captured by robbers who were Baharlu. Buchaqchis horse now gave out and it was found that it had been shot through belly and another in haunch. At this point police sowar’s horse galloped up with gear complete including rifle in bucket. Mounted Buchaqchi on it and vetoing his proposal to gallop on to Lehsard decided to try and return to Burj on eastern side of Tang by detour through hills. Attack occurred shortly after 6 p.m., and we safely reached Burj at 1 a.m., having had to abandon horses at 8 p.m., owing to precipitous ground. I brought in rifle myself and horses were recovered next day. After reconnoitering Burj we found it in the hands of our people, none of whom was hurt or missing, caravan also intact. Pending and after our escape from Tang and capture of clerk, police sowar and Buchaqchi Abdari events on south side of Tang were as follows-t 6 Abdul Alim and police sowar Haji Abdulla Tangistani beard firing and advanced towards mouth of Tang, Haji advanced to the Tang and saw Baharlus with prisoners and reported to Abdul Alim, he again went on and leader of Buchaqchis arriving asked Abdul Alim to go and inform 4 local tufangchis in Burj, Buchaqchi leader then went on taking third police sowar’s rifle and was at once captured with Haji, latter’s rifle also taken and his horse had been earlier. Abdul Alim who was now being threatened with them galloped back to Burj and intercepted our caravan. The Baharlus then stripped their five prisoners and carried them off one farsakh to the west of Tang, when they ultimately allowed them to return to Burj which they reached before me. Our losses are one Consular escort horse killed, one stolen, two police rifles, belts, saddles, &amp;c., 55 rounds 'SOS ammunition and some minor personal property, watches, clothes, &amp;c. Buchaqchis state their losses as one horse killed, one stolen, two rifles, two mules with loads including some private money and 400 tomans of Sirdar Nusrat’s. Bobbers were Baharlu Turks and some Tajik Farsis belonging to Hamza | Khan under the leadership of a youth Haji, they were about eighty sowars. Section of road is in charge of Ahmed Khan, nephew of Ali Khan Ahmedi, who had only four tufangchis in Burj. I had received no warning possible danger. Robbers seem only just to have arrived and to have had no knowledge of our caravan and there is no reason to regard attack as premeditated attack on British Consul or European. In view of net result affair could not have fallen out more fortunately as in (? ordinary) circum stances Baharlu would have iufallibly captured whole combined caravan of 120 loads including Consulate specie. There will be no security in Western Kerman till Baharlu have been adequately dealt with. I shall revert to this point later.

For past six weeks large bands of Baharlu have been infestingBunder Abbas road, Kerman Province, between Daulatabad is Fandaqah and Baft and they are now threatening Sirjan and Rafsinjan hundreds of loads have been carried off and there are no local means of coping with this peril. No progress can be made towards pacifying or policing country till Baharlus have been dealt with. Sykes hopes to tackle it from Shiraz side with help of Barman Parma to whom he wishes strong injunction to be sent by Persian Government. I hope this may be done but personally I feel that it is doubtful whether Shiraz will be able to deal with situation successfully for a long time to come and think we should deal with it ourselves from Bunder Abbas with adequate Indian force as in case of Persian Baluchistan. Suppression of Baharlu will give us great prestige of which we stand in much need here and practically solve our difficulties in Kerman Province. Military Police cannot become factor in case at least for a year. Addressed Tehran, 5; repeated Bushire, 4. Ends.

Following is my appreciation of situa tion:—Gamshadzais and Yarmohzais have taken our money and, after having made unprovoked assaults on our Line of Communications, broken their signed pledges; they must, therefore, be heavily punished or cleared out of the Sarhad. The Yarmohzais have been driven out of their fastnesses in the Morpish and Gildikoh Ranges, and are reported to have taken refuge under Dahram Khan of Bampur. I am proceeding against the Gamshadzais to drive hem out of Safed Koh and bring them to book. As my quarrel is with Gamshadzais and Yarmohzais, I am in no way interfering with Bahram Khan and, if he chooses to give refuge to our enemies, I must ask for your further orders. If the supply question can be settled satisfactorily, I think he will be easily brought to reason. I do not anticipate that he will take any active action against me. It is my opinion that Khwash ? (H ?) must not be evacuated and two more field forts should be made, one at Gusht, the other at Korin near Galugan, with secondary posts where necessary. As I need to be constantly on the move, I am much hampered by not being in telegraphic communications with you. Hence my reason for asking for aerial line to Ladis as it appears that Mirwera is at times rather far for wireless to act from Khvash (H Khwash.1 15 not b e ifght^nts GamSliaaZai8 WiU yleld bef ° re 1 reaeh Jalk and will General^ Baluchis ta u! ° f the General Staff; repeated Agent to the Governor- „ • 71 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 8276, dated the Hth August 1916 ) Telegram P., No. 71071, dated the 10th August 1916, From—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla, C (1) Major Wagstaff, Bunder Abbas. 10 / ^ 0fficer Commanding, Bunder Abbas.

Kennion telegraphs following, dated Kasvin, 14th :— Begins. I have just returned from seeing Baratoff at Serab and his staff at Avoh. Move of infantry who are being withdrawn to Sultan Bulak Pass or north of it will be completed on 14th. On northern side there are at least two regiments of cavalry. Remainder of cavalry and guns are near Kurujan watching enemy outpost at Akbulak. The Russian troops at Sonna safely withdrawn. So far enemy have not moved since their arrival at Hamadan.Bussian infantry does not exceed 11 battalions,' about 350 strong. Strength of enemy except in cavalry is said to be thrice that of Prussians. Details are being sent separately. Turkish objective not yet known. Baratoff’s intention is to take position on Sultan Bulak Pass where enemy, unless strong enough to leave force to contain him, will be forced to fight him before advancing anywhere. It is not intention that the Bussian troops, 800 Cossacks and 2 guns should be moved from Ispahan. Baratoff said that chance of stopping enemy depended largely on troops getting 4 or 5 days’ rest, of which they were obviously in need. He thought it likely that enemy would wait before renewing offensive. Baratoff spoke of enemy’s heavy casualties at Asadabad, but I do not credit them, as they turned flank of each position. As regards reinforcements, Baratoff said drafts were, I think, continually coming up the road, but those, I think, are to complete, not fresh units. Strong reinforcements, he said, had been promised. My personal opinion, however, is that enemy could drive Bussian troops from new position, but that they will not risk going much further from their base, and trust Persian pro-German element to bring about revolution. Baratoff impressed me that the sure way to secure enemy’s retirement would be threatened advance by our troops, adding that all operations in this theatre ought, in his opinion, to be under one direction.

Kennion’s telegram of August 15th, No. 7—13. If necessity of withdrawing from Ispahan is seriously contemplated by Bussians, I venture respectfully to suggest, for consideration, whether before the necessity becomes apparent it would not be better to invite Bakbtiaris to bold Ispahan in order to release Bussian troops for repelling common enemy. In that case it might be possible to make a compact with them under which Bakhtiari Governor palatable to both families would be chosen for Ispahan and all Khans would stand in with us and hold together. Not only would it be disastrously humiliating for the Bussians merely to evacuate when obviously obliged but in all probability the pro-German element would get upper hand and our friends have to join them or be left in the lurch.

Your telegram (dated) 8th received to-day. On strength of tetegram received from Sykes yesterday morning announcing that troops of Bussian Government had suffered a defeat and Legations were about to leave Tehran, we had separate confidential meeting with S(ardar) N{psrat) and Governor- General. With the former I discussed means of controlling local situation. The latter withdrew his declared intention of throwing up Governorship and agreed to bury hatchet and work cordially with S(ardar) N (osrat) pending crisis. On this basis we have effected temporary reconciliation between them and both have returned to their duties which they had abandoned. It will probably be best to let this arrangement stand as long as it works satisfactorily. Governor- General is affraid to leave here.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Telegram No.'491-C. from Sykes to Government of India. Premature abandonment of Sykes’ programme of proceeding to Shiraz is deprecated by me. It would be admission that situation is lost and would result in escape of German prisoners and collapse of situation in Shiraz and would inevitably have its centre coup in other places. Knowledge that original plan is being carried out will on the other hand encourage our friends and Kawam in particular to hold on. Russian Minister informs me that Russian detachment at Ispahan is to be retained and that Commandant is authorised to confer with Sykes. Its continued presence at Ispahan relieves us apparently of necessity for considering safety of Ispahan and even if troops are not allowed to give Sykes immediate co-operation is in itself considerable moral support to him. Farman Farma seems ready to proceed to Shiraz provided that he can join forces with Sykes. This shows that this course is practicable in his opinion. Without being joined by Sykes however he would not go nor could Gough go south except with grave risk. That Turks can send troops to Bars seems most improbable. They may however send some to Ispahan and in this case Russian contingent could move pouth and join Sykes.

No. Q 1 M Dated 4 AuG 1316The Foreign Office has communicated on the subject with Marling ; but the best way to really influence the state of affairs would be to send a small mixed force with machine guns and guns via the Bakhtiari country to Ispahan, The presence of some such force would not only influence Kurds’ (course of action ?) through the Bakhtiaris but that of other Southern Persia tribes; and it would also be a proof of our good understanding with Russians. The Russians seem at present to be unable to support Zil-es-Sultan at Ispahan, and Marling can probably do little with the Bakhtiaris without this. Without Russian consent no action will be taken, and I would like your ideas as to the desirability and feasibility of despatching this force, before suggesting it to them. I would be glad to know what progress is being made by the (Southern ?) Persia Military Police. Addressed General Officer Commandine, Force “ D ”; repeated to the Commander-in-Chief in India. 305 (Received with the Army Department endorsement No. 7216, dated the 26th July 1$16.) Telegram P., No. I. G.-3331, dated the 22nd (received 23rd) July 1916. From—The General Officer Commanding, Force “ D ”, Basrah, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. Your 19657 of July 17th. Point 1.—Regarding practicability of sending a small mixed (?) force Did Bakhtiari country to Ispahan. The move of any but small bodies of troops is rendered difficult owing to scarcity of water and by reason of the impoverish ed state of the country. Wheeled guns cannot traverse the country. Still, in case of necessity, the route is (practicable—omitted in original). Point 2 .—Regarding desirability, attaching to the proposal are all the dis advantages of a detachment and the further disadvantage of its being, in case of accidents, practically beyond support. In addition to this, in my opinion and that of Cox, it would not influence the Kurds in any way nor^ have any useful effect in Southern Persia or Pars. It would be useful if it had the effect of keeping the Bakhtiaries generally, in check, but the contrary effect would probably result if Bakhtiaries thought expedition was moving to assist Russians in establishing Zil-es-Sultan. Any small detachment of the strength, of, say, 2 battalions, &amp;c., would be in a somewhat exposed position with a line of communication difficult of maintenance, if the Bakhtiaris were hostile. The main source of any favourable attitude towards the British, now existing amongst the Bakhtiaris, is the belief that we stand between them and their complete domination by Russian and other peoples, hostile to them, and any misunderstanding would be unfortunate. The maintenance of the ammunition supply to the detachment at Ispahan would be through the Bakhtiari country, therefore their attitude is a very prominent factor in this question. Therefore I cannot, in view of these points, consider the scheme as being, primd facie, desirable. Between Director of Military Intelligence No. 19523-G.—150 (?) of July 14th, and your telegram under reply, I note a divergence (?) in that former limits question to political pressure. Considered from this latter standpoint my views, with which Cox is in agreement, are that the tribes between myself and Baratoff which are chiefly affected are — 1st .—Those Pesh-i-Kuh whom I am taking steps to stiffen by the influence of Political Officers working from Bakhtiari country situate to the south-west. These are understood to favour the Russians. 2nd .—The Kulkurs whom, I fear, we cannot largely influence and who are mainly pro-Turkish. 3rd. —Pusht-i-Kuh with whose ruler we are in constant touch, and whose populace is mainly anti-Turkish.The late Governor of Luristan, Kizam-us-Sultaneh, who is now of no importance. &lt;.• i th ^ hG with whom I hope soon to establish touch, and who are anti- Turkish.

There is no doubt that the parties under the above named officers inflicted heavy loss on the Ismailzais. I was informed that their casualties were about 150 killed and wounded and had a demoralising effect. 316 Telegram, No. 428-C., dated the 28th (received 29th) July 1916.

I should like, therefore, to re present the matter on my own account, as during my tour I heard a good deal about the fight of the 13th April which lasted for about 9 hours, and in which Captain Bennett himself appears to have behaved with considerable personal coolness and to have shown a fine example in the face of a determined and stronger enemy. fud'i dir. 319 Telegram P., No. 3749, dated the 2.8th (received 29th) July 1916. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Noel sends following, dated July 27th, Ispahan. My comments will be sent after seeing Army Commander :— Begins. German cause has received great impetus in Bakhtiari country as result of Russian retreat. There has been influx of German emissaries and Mujahidin whose propaganda has met with considerable response. Hostile party is divided at present as to whether sowars should be sent to join Turks or should remain in Bakhtiari country waiting opportunity to seize Ispahan. Latter counsel seems likely to prevail. I believe Illkhani and Illbegi to be honest in their protestations that they are ready to act up to their engagements. They have sunk their differences as result of recent change in position and are working in harmony. Their position, however, is weak and they can take no effective action in our interests without our assistance. I would mention an illustrative of present position that Abul Kasim Zargham’s son has collected a body of sowars within a day’s march of Chigha- khor with avowed intention of being revenged on me for treatment he received at Shush at hands of our troops. I had some difficulty when coming into Ispahan in evading him. I pressed Khans on my arrival at Chighakhor to fulfil their promise to expel German Charge d’Affaires. Their answer was that situation has changed since meeting at Ahwaz when they had moreover warned Cox that if Turks took Kermanshah they would not be in a position to exercise their authority among tribes in our favour. They consented on being further pressed to take action but asked me to represent to you that the least movement against Z. on their part would lead to open hostility between them and other members of their families and that this would entail closing of Lynch road and possibly reflex (?) at oil fields, and that without our assistance with money and arms, they were not strong enough to obtain the upper hand eventually. I have thought it advisable, under these circumstances, to come into Ispahan and represent matters to you. In my opinion Khans are justified in their attitude and we will run grave risk of hostile faction getting upper hand if we do not assist them and Turkish position is maintained at Kermanshah. I would call attention in this connection to Cox’s telegram of May 26th, No. 2476, in which he refers to the Khans’ suggestions as regards assistance from us as “ feasible and necessary ”. There is another aspect to the question. Unless we strengthen the hands of Illkhani and Illbegi to enable them to deal with younger Khans who are set upon making Zil-es-Sultan’s position as difficult as they can. Russian or British intervention in Bakhtiaristan will be sooner or later inevitable with Zil-es-Sultan as Governor-General and continuance of present Russian aggressive and entirely uncompromising attitude towards Bakhtiaris. As an alternative means to this end, we might have recourse to establishment of a Bakhtiari Police force under British officers. I believe the Khans would welcome such an experiment.7 With regard to measure of assistance, we should give Khans I would suggest, oOG rides, 216,000 rounds of ammunition and payment of 300 sowars at lo tomans a month and 500 footmen at 9 tomans as well as despatch from Arabistan of 2 maxims with wing of a Gurkha Battaltn L Srt ^ SnnnrvKh f ^ UmtS W ° uld g ° far to ensure snccess of venture Supply Khans from Tehran arsenal with 500 rounds for their 7 centimetre gun would also be necessary. centimetre Bis Snd'ps lofopptd^u^ fatler evlntualltj. ^ ° Uter raB = e -k ia 320 From Telegram P., No. 24-F., dated (and received) the 29th July 1916.

I have got possession of letter from Pugin near Khorremabad to Soulet Germans have apparently arrived at some understanding with Soulet, as the letter contains an assurance that recent successes near Kermanshah may soon give him opportunity of carrying out his promises. There has so far not been any fighting between Kashkais and Bakhtiaris, hut their forces have been in contact./ It is represented by the Khans that Soulet’s position among tribes is now shaky and that if Zaigham were appointed Illkhani by Persian Government with order to Bakhtiaris to assist him against Soulet it would be easy for him to establish his position among tribes. According to the Khans, Zaigham is in their power and they will guarantee that he will undertake in return for his appointment as Illkhani, to release O’Connor, capture Wassmuss and have Ghazanfar as well generally co-operate with us. It is very desirable to take action before Bakhtiari Kashkais fighting is over. If suggestion commends itself, awaiting instructions. Addressed Tehran; repeated to Basrah and Ispahan.

From The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Basrah, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. My telegram No. 1557. Reference second paragraph. I received very insolent reply from Sheikh Hussein absolutely declining to exchange Christmas and saying that only way to obtain release of prisoners (other than by killing Sheikh Hussein and all his people) is—(1) by returning cash and tea confiscated ; (2) giving assurances re road. 2. Reference paragraph one, received letter from O’Connor last evening saying that he had seen my letter of July 15th to Zair Khidar suggesting exchange of prisoners and that latter was quite willing to exchange provided of course that his other two conditions of restoration of cash and tea and assurance about opening the road are complied with. In view of fact that whole object of negotiations is to get prisoners away out of the heat quickly, it seems useless to make further delay by haggling. It is also undignified in view of the fact that Khans are set on getting their conditions and in the end we shall have to concede them if we wish to get prisoners out soon. I propose therefore to reply to Khans on following lines: if the Khans agree to exchange prisoners on certain date, I will have Tangistani prisoners at spot fixed and agree to make following concessions in addition. As regards confiscated cash, I will produce Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar’s receipt showing that amount (10,000 tomans) which was confiscated when in deposit with him has been refunded. We however reserve the right to claim from Sheikh Hussein the sum of about 2,500 tomans, which was paid out in compensation to sufferers in the raids last August. As regards tea, it is deposited in Bushire Custom House godowns and a certificate to that effect from Director will be produced. ( As regards opening the road, after exchange of prisoners all prohibitions against the use of any road will be withdrawn. So will restrictions by sea except customs preventive work. Traffic across Mashileh will be permitted during day and will be regulated by military. Khans, for their part, should give facilities for repairing telegraph lines, and if these not given within, say, 15 days, or if lines again cut after repair, we reserve right to close road again. Similarly in the case of robberies or disturbances taking place on road or mis behaviour of tribes. This, I suggest, might be offered to Khans on a “ take it or leave it ” basis, though perhaps the tea being in custom house would be stumbling block and might require modification.

It seems that Khans wish us to believe that irritation caused among hostile Khans by return of Zil-es-Sultan and Russian reverse in Kermanshab District has raised German influence to a higher pitch than ever before. I find it difficult to credit this comparing situation to-day with that of 8 months ago outside and inside this country, and I think that Khans are trying to squeeze us. That Khans are really in want of arms I can hardly believe, as all accounts agree in describing tribe as fully armed. It would be impossible in any case to give them arms, as this would evoke strongest protest from Russia, this would indeed be only natural in view of attitude of our “ Bakhtiari friends ” to us and to Russians and their general failure to carry out spirit of recent agreement. Returning to Chigahor, you should remind Khans that war is everywhere going in our favour except for Kermanshah incident, that Arabia is in revolt against Turks, that news of attack on Kerbela and Nejef has reached Persian Government, and that Russians have taken Erzinjan in last few days.

The Khans and the tribesmen much less fail to understand the significance of events outside Persia. To them the visible sign of the progress of the war is Kermanshah, v $ It is not much of a bait to promise a collective reward, as action will have to be taken by Illkham and Illbegi and their share of £10,000 will scarcely cover cost of their military measures against the other Khans. Last week Salar Masoud with 400 sowars, chiefly Bakhtiaris, put up a light against the Russians at Tirun within a day’s march of Ispahan as you have doubtless heard. r j ^ I have received message from Zafar to-day urging me to return immediate ly and restrain younger Khans who are bent on playing the fool.

Everybody who can seems at present bent on having a kick at the .Bakhtiaris and it would take very little more to make Illkhani and Illbe°i throw up the sponge. At present their chief standby is phrase used upon 23rd March that Ispahan was lost to them for a while. On this they are always harping, and it is with some misgiving that I look forward to the time when it is realised that Zil-es-Sultan is a fixture here.

The amount should he delivered to Sheikh Hussein in full as he may wish and no reference should be made at present to claim for compensation for raids. The tea should similarly he delivered as Zair Zhidar may desire. It is useless to hamper negotiations by any form of obstruction in regard to either tea or money.

From—The General Officer Commanding, Sistan, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. I have the honour to forward herewith the proceedings of a Court of *h/b Enquiry held on the circumstances under which the Damani prisoners escaped ' on June the 25th and June 28th. 1. The day before Captain James left Khwash I saw him personally in my tent, and explained to him the vital necessity of safeguarding 'the prisoners he was to escort to Saindak. I gave him more troops than I could well spare from my small garrison at Khwash. He took with him to Kalchat 3 troops cavalry, 1 Indian officer and 50 men, 19th Punjabis, and 1 machine gun, 12th Pioneers, together with some 6 good Chagai Levies. That the prisoners were allowed to escape on the night of his departure with the extraordinary-ease with which they apparently did, can only have been due to everybody including sentries and guard having gone to sleep. Men did not even fall in on their ajarm posts for a practice alarm. Nor were the majority of prisoners bound, though orders were apparently given to this effect. 2. That the escort under Captain James allowed itself to be ambushed on the 28th June by what now appears to have been only 29 men, shows in my opinion a greater amount of carelessness than was shown on the night of the 25tk-26th. The locality where the party was ambushed was known to me, and also to Captain James. Considering the repeated warnings he had received and the lesson he should have learnt on the night of the 25th-26th, only his lack of taking very ordinary military precautions could have enabled the enemy to carry out their very bold enterprise with such complete success. No doubt the infantry he had were young and the 2 troops cavalry appeared to be too heavily armed, as they carry not only a lance and a rifle but also a sword and a bayonet, and apparently are accustomed to dismount leaving the rifle in the bucket. This may have been the cause of their losing so many rifles, which number I believe 13, but the final report of losses at this action has not been received by me. I can only hope that the result of the escape of the prisoners may lead to a more perfect settling of the Damani and Gamshadzai tribes hereafter.

Our joint note has been presented and an appa rently satisfactory reply was received to-day. Its substance is as follows :— (1) Gratitude is expressed by Ministry of Foreign Affairs for good will and assistance of two Powers. Proposal for gradual formation of forces of 22,000 under British and Russian instructors, &amp;e., under orders of Persian Ministry of War is then accepted and note is gratefully taken of readiness of Powers to finance forces and find necessary officers. (2) Another force will, however, be maintained by Government at capital and in particular gendermerie will be maintained until new forces are formed. (3) As regards financial reform grant of extended powers suggested in annex to joint note is agreed to with the reserve that these powers will not be retrospective, (4) Subsidy of tomans 200,000 is gratefully accepted and hope is expressed that commission will soon be able to secure payment of taxes by foreigners. (5) As Persia is a constitutional country, these measures will be submitted to national assembly and Senate for approval when these bodies meet. End of summary. (1) Insertion of “ Under orders of Persian Ministry of War ” has been made so as to place Sykes* force on same footing as Cossack brigade. (2) The object of these suggestions is to furnish Shah with a special bodyguard and to provide some force to secure safety of roads in vicinity of capital. (3) Reserve is designed to prevent commission from investigating and annulling numerous shady transactions connived at of late by Minister. (5) is designed as a sop to constitution and also to save Minister from attack. The reply contains no such ambiguities as I expected, and Russian Minister and I think that it should be accepted at once.

All the English and Russians with many Armenians had to leave Ispahan in the beginning of September. The same kind of thing occurred in Yezd during our march through and in Kerman at the news of our approach Wustrow had the English driven out of Shiraz in December they were ‘deported* by the democrats. Wassmuss is carrying on his work successfully. The head of the group Z has already reached Bampur. Zugmeyer and Greisinger are following lo-day. 5 “ Affairs in general stand as follows, i.e., the whole of the South and Middle Persia are on our side, the Russians have still only got Azerbaijan, Tehran and Khorasan, the English have Sistan and a few places on the coast. Tne administration of the State has come to a complete end, the orders of the bribed Persian Government (once again Ain-ed-Daulah and Firman Firma) are ignored, the Governors and to a certain extent the Gendarmerie have gone over to the Mujahidds.

Pighting has already begun at Hamadan with, as we hear, success._ . —&lt; -- 2 “ The English have had a fiasco at Kut, after they had practically reached Baghdad. They have given up the Dardanelles after suffering great losses Serbia and Montenegro are settled. The general military situation is excellent and apparently there is a new offensive in Elanders. “ My work in Ispahan may be considered finished, as the place after our enemies were driven out of it was exhausted. After that I went on a IS-days* journey with your brother to the Bakhtiaris and Kashgais. On our return about the 1st October received your order [to advance. This has been delayed as Count Kanitz declared it to be impossible, and promised us machine guns’ but unfortunately nothing came of it. Finally, I declared that I could not wait any longer and started on 24th November. The line of advance via Tabas had to be given up, because the rainy season and shortage of fodder made it impassable. Instead of it I chose the Yezd-Kerman-Neh-Farah route This road appeared to be very promising as it was reported that Nek was unoccupied.] “ A reconnaissance, which I undertook on camels with Winckelmann and Waldmann into the Lut, and which ended in a successful fight at Deh Salm against 40 English (Indians and Berberis), [produced the knowledge however that the English have occupied the frontier from Birjand to Kuh-i-Malik I Siah exceptionally strongly. (We miss Laban ? Winckelmann.) To break through this position with the unwieldy caravan is impossible. From above I have received no help in spite of all my requests and reports. The situation in Khorasan appears more favourable; the Russians are slowly withdrawing from there. To cover my flank towards Birjand I require however several hundred men, and on that account I have opened up communication with the (Bakarlus). Nevertheless, you must take into account that it will first of all only be possible to get the gold to you. Also the technical difficulties are immense. It seems strange that from your side neither has any thing been done in o ur direction nor any messages sent.] I heard privately that the Iron Cross has been bestowed upon those gentlemen whom you recom mended. Where is the fiddle ? The cash of Dr. Becher and Laban (Winckei- mann ?) has been saved. Everyone is passably well—would like to be on the move forwards. Best greetings from all. Enclosure $o. 2.

As the Minister’s mind is already made up in the sense desired by Colonel O’Connor and as it has been decided by the Government of India to present their views regarding negotiating with the hostile Khans afresh to His Majesty’s Government, it did not seem to me that any useful purpose would be served by sending this telegram to the Minister, and I shall not do so unless Sir P.

It is perhaps unnecessary for me to comment on it beyond observing that— (1) I am not conscious of having threatened the Khans beyond remark ing in a letter some time ago that if they did not exchange the prisoners it would be the worse for them : this I did by authority- (2) It was Colonel O’Connor himself who first mooted the question of escaping and of seizing the fort of Ahram. Enclosure No. i- To Major Trevor (in invisible ink). Many thanks for your letter of 17th. We are always glad of news* Will you please send attached to Minister? Telegram S. D. to Minister, Tehran :— “ Abram, 24th June, to Minister, Tehran. Reference previous corre spondence. After the despatch of my telegram of 11th June to you, Khan approached me again with fresh proposals lor settlement which I duly com municated to Major Trevor for submission to you. These proposals were on the same lines as those previously submitted and explicitly excluded any request for assurance, 1 presume, therefore, that you will be prepared to5 effect settlement on these lines but as I have received no message from you or any intimation as to what your views are or whether any negotiations are in progress with Khans with object of effecting our release I venture to address you again in hope that yon may be able to effect speedy settlement. In case any difficulty should arise over question of reopening main road and resumption of traffic between Bushire and neighbouring districts or any other matter, I venture to suggest that Acting Resident should be instructed to avoid as far as possible entering into question of detail. It appears to me that all that is called for now is assurance that when prisoners have been exchanged and normal relations resumed traffic will, of course, be opened as before by all roads. I venture to add that conditions of life here in heat now prevailing are almost intolerable. Two members of our party* Mr. Smith and Mr. Christmas, are in very feeble health and are daily growing weaker. In my opinion and in that of doctor they cannot possibly support this life much longer. Doctor himself too is in bad state of health and is just now incapacitated by severe attack of fever. As no doubt you are aware Mr. Pettigrew died on 27th April in circumstances which I shall report to you later. “ We would none of us complain of any hardships to which we were subjected if our detention here was really necessary or could in any way be regarded as being of service to our country. But we feel that on the contrary our indefinite retention by this petty Khan within thirty miles of Bushire is not only useless from point of view of interests of Great Britain but is actively prejudicial to our national prestige. “ Both on personal and on general grounds, therefore, I venture again to urge upon you desirability of terminating this intolerable situation as soon as possible. „ 1 0 Connor.

You no doubt understand that our authorities at Bushire have placed themselves in a false position by repeated threats of vengeance on Khans which they have been unable to fulfil and they are now naturally reluctant to give way to Khans in any matter. But as apparently military authorities have definitely refused to employ force, only course left is to make best terms possible. I venture again to urge, therefore, that if you consider our release desirable you will express your views plainly to Bushire authorities and instruct them to effect settlement as soon as possible. Major Trevor has not given me any information regarding your views nor as to negotiations which he is ap parently conducting with Khans, but he constantly urges us to try and escape which course besides being extremely risky is impracticable for certain members of party, and we do not propose to attempt it especially in view of situation in rest of Persia. l i j Enclosure No. 3. Translation of a letter from Colonel O’Connor written in Persian, dated Ahram, the 26th June, received Bushire, the 29th June 1916. Dear Trevor, I request that you will immediately send to Minister in Tehran telegram to following effect:— o “S. D., dated Ahram, 26th June, to the British Minister, Tehran. The Khan has informed me that a reply has come from Major Trevor and that they have accepted for an exchange of prisoners to take place and return of confiscated goods or the value of them, but that the matter of the opening of the road between this Vilayet and the Shahi road must be held over till the prisoners have been exchanged. The Khans do not accept this and more than that the exchange of the prisoners should take place they desire to have assurances that the road shall be opened. 1 hope that you will agree to give such an assurance immediately to the Chiefs and telegraph necessary instruc tions to Bushire as quickly as possible.

Enclosure. Statement of I)r. E. Azzopardy, M.D. Edgard Azzopardy, M.D., lately Doctor to the Indo-European Telegraph Department, Shiraz, states p I was going on leave to Europe last November with a view to offering mv services as a medical man to Government, when I was arrested by the Gendar merie at Dehbid and sent back. I got back to Shiraz towards the end of JNovember. On arrival I was taken before Wustrow, the German Consul, who told nm I must wait a few days till it was decided what was to be done with me. iwo days after I was taken before Wustrow again and he said “ O’Connor is very ill at Borasjun and you must go and attend him ”. I said all ri^ht • I was sent down to Borasjun under a Gendarme escort. On arrival at Bo°rasjun I saw the Shiraz Consulate sowars there and they said the Consul was not there. Afterwards the Gendarmerie officer said the Consul was at Abram and I must go there the next day. 1 accordingly went there under escort of Gendarmes. I arrived there on the 9th December. On arrival I saw the fort and as I came up I saw Wassmuss. He said “ You are Dr. Azzopardy ? ” I said “Yes”. He said “You are my prisoner, come inside”. I replied “Very good there are 8 here, I shall be the 9th ”, I found Colonel O’Connor was not ill. At Ahram I found we were in charge of Zair Khidar Khan. He was kind to us in his own way and treated us well. The prisoners, Colonel O’Connor, Mr. Eerguson, Mr. Smith, Mr. Christmas, Mr. Pettigrew, Mr. Ayrton, Mr. Livingstone and Mr. Misso were in the Kala Kalat, a building with 2 rooms and a small compound only about 12 yards square. Wassmuss has his headquarters at the Balakhana-i-Nao on the other side of the town about 5 minutes’ walk away. I found that stores and pro visions and newspapers were being received from Bushire. The newspapers were censored by Wassmuss and large portions cut out, All boxes of stores were opened for inspection by Wassmuss. Most of items arrived all right, occasionally a tin of cigarettes or a box of biscuits were taken out. We &amp; got practically all the things however. We had to live in great discomfort with no proper cook and very bad food. In the spring there was a tremendous plague of Hies, fleas mosquitoes, sand flies and bats. There were also a good many snakes about. Wdien the hot weather really set in, these pests dis appeared. During April the Khan was very kind. On the 22nd of April Pettigrew was taken ill when going to the closet. I was called and rushed down and found he had an attack of angina pectoris and was unconscious. I revived him, and ordered him, to refrain from smoking and put him on diet.On the 23rd he had another slight attack. On the morning of the 27th April ■we heard the sound of guns and heard that some sort of advance was being made from Bushire. They told us the Khan had gone off. We were shut up in cur rooms. The Khan’s Mirza whose name I don’t know came to the Kala at about 10-30 or 11 a.m., and said that we would have to be shot and they would go off to the hills. He said that Colonel O’Connor would be shot first and the rest afterwards and then they would go off to the hills. It had always been the idea of the Khans to take us off to hills if the British troops came as they knew that they could not resist them. Afterwards w^e were in our rooms. I was lying on my bed. Pettigrew was lying on his bed reading a book in the other room. At about 2-30 I was hastily called by the others who said Pettigrew had had another attack. I rushed in and found him already dead. He undoubtedly died of angina pectoris. Possibly the fright he had in the morning may have induced another attack. We buried Pettigrew about 5 o’clock the same day outside the fort. After this nothing much of interest happened. All the party suffered from diarrhoea and disorder of the bowels in the spring but afterwards got better. Messrs. Livingstone, Ayrton and Misso have kept fairly well the whole time. I suffered a good deal from fever and nervous excitement. Eventually I had a very sharp attack about the 26th of June and Zair Khidar Khan thought I was going to die and so he wrote to Sheikh Hussain suggesting 1 should be released. Sheikh Hussain agreed and I was released on 28th June. I left the next day under escort for Ali Changi and came on from there yesterday arriving here last night. When I left Colonel O’Connor, Messrs. Ferguson, Livingstone, Ayrton and Misso were quite w r ell, Mr. Smith and Mr. Christmas were not in good health. Mr. Smith is suffering from weak heart and congestion of the veins. Mr. Christmas is suffering from progressive atrophy : he is like a skeleton. It would be good thing to exchange them, but the Khan will not, I think, let them go separately. The Khan (Zair Khidar) is very friendly indeed just now. He hopes to get an answer about opening the road and exchange of prisoners. The day I left an emissary from Saulet-ud-Douleh arrived with the Khadkhuda of Semel to try and persuade the Khans to give us up. Zair Khidar did not seem likely to agree and said he would make his own arrangements with the English. The Khans seem in a poor way now. Zair Khidar has not more than 50 men. Between him and Sheikh Hussain I do not think they could muster 100 or 120 men. Wassmuss has had no influence now for about a month or 6 w T eeks. There is a strong party against him at Abram : about a month ago lie was attacked in the Balakhana-i-Nao at Abram and several shots fired at him one night. The people all round Ahram were quite friendly to the prisoners. They are heartily sick of the whole business. Before me, Bushire; v A. P.

As more troops could not be spared from Khwash, I instructed Captain James to march to Chah-i-Zar from Kalchat, and I met him there on evening of July 26th (June 26th ?). During the night of 26th/27th July (June?) I took 1 troop of cavalry, 36 infantry and 1 machine gun from him. The remainder of the troops with him, viz.y those detailed in my B. M. 80 went to Saindak, via Siah Jangal from Chah-i-Zar, escorting the 4 remain ing prisoners.With a view to breaking up, as far as possible, the Yar Muhammadzai combination, and thus protecting Captain James and the wireless, I proceeded to Kamalabad. I am told that I succeeded fairly well, and that James was ambushed by 35 men only. 246 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. H. 6348, dated the 12th July 1916.) Telegram P., No. 1221-P.

Report from Officer Commanding, Bandan, states that a patrol of 28th Cavalry sent out, lost themselves in the desert, one of the men and three horses dying of thirst. General Officer Commanding anticipates that, while he is out, wireless will have to remain at Rhwash, as he may he beyond their range of com munication with Saindak.

In other political matters you should address Cox or the local Consuls. 252 Telegram P., No. 450 F., dated the 14th (received 15th) July 1916, From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. 1 Telegram No. 973 from Petrograd. Russian' Minister and I recommend addressing Persian Government note summarised as follows. Representatives of two Governments are authorised to make following proposals with a view to assisting Persian Government to maintain order in Persia and to improvino 1 its financial administration. (1) Raising of a force of military police in Southern Persia and gradual extension of Cossack Brigade in North Persia each force eventually to be 11,000 men, strong. Sufficient number of officers* non-commissioned officers, doctors, &amp;c., to he placed by the two Governments respectively at the disposal of Persian Government for this purpose and upkeep of two forces and cost of equipment at least to be met by them until end of war. Por the maintenance of these forces after the war mixed financial com mission will decide what sources of revenue could be applied. (2) * * * to the not inconsiderable wishes of Persian Government in regard to taxation of foreigners the two Governments are ready to accede in this entirely, hut they hold that powers of mixed commission should be extended on lines already suggested by latter. Two Governments would consent to impose following taxes if Persian Government grant to commission such extension of powers. Trade licenses, excise on native tobacco, octroi, house tax— (a) Always provided that the foreigner will have right to appeal in case of unjust assessment to his Consul in the case of assessed taxes, such as house tax. (6) Payment of taxes might be enforced through Consul only, (c) No new tax to be levied on foreigners without assent of two Powers. Two Gov ernments in the event of agreement being arrived at on above lines will grant during war monthly subsidy of tomans 200,000. To the note we propose to annex memorandum defining powers which commission should possess. » (As bait they would ?) give commission full control over Persian finance. Provincial and Municipal, and reserve to Russian and British members power of veto on all more important matters. This is considered ample by Maclean.12 Duration of commission depends on the agreement of three Powers and no time limit is fixed. Maximum figure of 11,000 men {vide paragraph 1 of note) is taken at desire of itussian staff which deprecates fixing numbers of officers and non commissioned officers also. Present Cabinet is very ready to conclude agree ment and my colleague and I believe they will without difficulty accept something on these lines. As it is doubtful whether any other Minister would do, and as existence of present Cabinet is precarious, we recommend that we should be authorised to send in this note at once. I earnestly hope that two Governments will agree to this course in view of expediency for us of obtaining official recognition of Sykes* Mission.

Deputy Governor was instructed in the sense desired. AH Khan alias Mahomet Hussein has been arrested with one Sheikh Mahomet Beza. Kader Khan is with Soulet. Hassan Dawafarosh is in Ispahan. I am endeavouring to have pressure put on him there. It seems Ghulam Ali Behbehani and Haj Ghulam Hussein are closely connected with Soulet and I should prefer not to molest them for the moment if required information can be obtained from other sources indicated. Ghulam Hussein however wishes to go to Bushire and I propose to facilitate this in case you wish to squeeze him when he arrives.

He was driven off as quickly as possible and did no damage whatsoever. I do not know whether he had any casualties. When reinforcements arrive I will attack him; as a bad effect will be produced on other clans, such as Bekis and Ismailzia who are now anxious to go with us and attack Jiand, unless I do so. He cannot run far and it would never do, in my opinion, to let him rest,13 259 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 6617, dated the 15th July 1916.) Telegram, No. B.

Have not been asked to make arrangements. The whole escort would have to be drawn from Maskat as there are no troops available here they could not reach Daulatabad by 28th instant.

In the circumstances I would suggest that the regular escort now bring ing prisoners to Daulatabad from Kerman should continue on to Bunder Abbas. It is presumed that this escort is commanded by a British officer.

Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—-The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. In continuation of my letter No. 221-C., dated 26th June 1916, I have the honour to submit the following further particulars regarding the steps taken by His Excellency Darya Begi, with the assistance of the Commodore to punish the Khans of certain coast ports who helped the murderers of the late Khan Bahadur Agha Badr. H. M. ships t ‘Juno’ , , &lt; ‘Clio ,, and “Bramble” arrived at Asalu on the afternoon of the 22nd June and met the “ Persepolis ” with the Darya Begi on board there. His Excellency had decided to depose Ali Akbar Khan, the Shaikh of Asalu and install Muhammad bin Ahmed Khalfan, the Shaikh of the neighbouring town of Naband in his stead. His Excellency asked the Commodore to assist by demolishing certain forts which were held by the adherents of the Khan of Asalu, and were blocking the road by which the men of the Khan of Naband had to approach, and also by destroying the fort and towers in Asalu and the neighbouring suburb of Nakhl-Taqi. The forts and towers were accordingly demolished by His Majesty’s ships on the 23rd June, care being taken not to injure any of the neighbouring houses. On the 24th the Darya Begi informed the Commodore that resistance was at an end and asked him to proceed to Chiru and Shiwuh (the Shaikhs of which were also to be deposed) and destroy the forts in those places, while he (Darya Begi) remained lor a few days longer to settle in the new Shaikh and arrange matters. It w r as arranged that H. M. S. f{ Clio ” should resume her voyage to Bushire, and that H. M. S. “ Bramble ” should remain with the Darya Begi. In accordance with this arrangement H. M. S. “Juno” proceeded to Shiwuh on June 25th arriving there the same afternoon, and after warning the inhabitants, who left, proceeded to demolish a large fort and three towers. On the 26th “Juno” proceeded to Chiru, and arrived there at noon the same day. A notice was sent to the Shaikh that his fort and towers would be destroyed as a punishment for harbouring the murderers of the Lingah Agent, and after giving him time to remove all his people, the fort was demolished. H. M. S. “Juno” then proceeded to Henjam and Maskat. Meanwhile on 25th June H. M. S. “ Bramble ” which had remained with the “ Persepolis ” was requested by the Darya Begi to demolish the fort of Bidakhun which was found to contain adherents of the former Shaikh of Asalu. Bramble accordingly proceeded to Bidakhun and destroyed this fort. In the evening the Commander of H. M. S. “ Bramble ” accompanied the Governor ashore and witnessed the handing over of the district to the new Shaikh, Muhammad bin Ahmed Khalfan. Op the 28th June H. M. ships “Bramble” and “ Persepolis” went to Tahiii, and on the 29th to Kangun. Here the Darya Begi had to remove the Shaikh who had lebelled against his uncle Shaikh Hatim whose nominee he was, and had been actively aiding the enemies of Great Britain at the instigation of the Customs officer. His Excollencv landed some tufano’chis (riflemen) and requested H. M. S. “Bramble” to co-operate bv destroyim* two towers which were in the way of the advance. This was done on the 30th June, and Shaikh Saif surrendered, and the place was restored to Shaikh Hatim. The Customs Director was arrested by the Dar^a Begi and is a prisoner on board the “ Persepolis The same night (30th June) the “Persepolis” accompanied by H. M. S. Bramble left Kangun and proceeded to Mogam arriving there about 1 p. m. on the 1st July. On the morning of the 2nd July, the “ Persepolis ” took Shaikh Ibrahim A1 Hammacti of Kalat on board and some of his men in a dhow inIf tow, and both ships proceeded to Chiru arriving there at 2-30 p. m. Shaikh m ® n } a ^ d aud occu P ied the village without resistance. Jbrahiin nominated his son to be Shaikh of Chim and Hinderabi Island on his behalf, and the two ships returned to Mogam on the 3rd July. T he next day (4th) both ships left Mogam for Shiwuh each with a dhow m tow full of Shaikh Ibrahim s men, and arrived there in the afternoon. The village was deserted, and Shaikh Ibrahim tried to effect a landing. He was owever, unable to do so as his men when nearing the shore came under a gallmg fire from men concealed in some low hills a short distance behind the village. Some of the landing party were wounded and H. M. S. “ Bramble ” stood m to help the party to get off and opened fire on the snipers. It was, however, almost impossible to locate them and the fire was not very effective. Eventually the landing party got off again with the loss of a few men killed and several wounded, the latter being treated on board H. M. S. “Bramble Commodore who was now on his way back from Maskat in H M. S Juno was apprised of the failure of the landing at Shiwuh, and arrived there cm the afternoon of the 5th. He interviewed the Darya Begi and Shaikh Ibrahim early on the 6tb, and both of them stated that a further attempt to and would be useless, as for the present Shaikh Ibrahim would not be able to hold the place. His Excellency therefore asked the Commodore to destroy the town by gunfire and also to demolish the dhows drawn up on the beach This wa S&gt; successfully accomplished. The town was of course deserted; the Darya Begi and Shaikh Ibrahim declared that the dhows were the personal property of the Shaikh of Gaobandi, and it was therefore a suitable punishment tx&gt; him to destroy them. Except for the contretemps at Shiwuh the whole plan made by His Excellency the Darya Begi was successfully carried out with very little blood shed, and the prestige of the Governor of the Gulf Ports and consequently of Government, considerably enhanced. The Shaikhs of Asalu and • a ^i Eidakhun, Kangun and Chiru, who assisted the Eingah murderers m defiance of the Darya Begi’s orders, were removed and persons approved b y ^ Dar y a Vegi and ourselves installed. Shiwuh has been destroyed and should the Shaikh of Gaobandi under whom it is attempt to rebuild it, the Darya Begi will take an opportunity to remove him and instal the Shaikh of Jialat, if he is then in a position to hold it, or if not some one else. It is to be hoped that this punishment will be a lesson to other Shaikhs. As soon as the question of the Shiraz prisoners is settled, the matter of punish ing the participants in the murder of Khan Bahadur Agha Badr now in confinement will be taken up, and efforts will be made to secure the apprehension of the other murderers who are still at large.
