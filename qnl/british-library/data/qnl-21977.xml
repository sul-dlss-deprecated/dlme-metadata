No. T—- *?+ sf. of 136b Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 27th R/Thani 136b March 31, 1946. With reference to your letter No. 941-29/18 dated 24th March 1946, I have discussed the matter with Eis Highness who is strongly averse to allowing the merchants to import the tea quota at present. His Highness considers that tea and sugar are the commodities upon which the State depends for all its imports of meat, firewood, onions etc., and, to a certain extent, the use of tea and sugar for barter is the means by which merchants are encouraged to bring cereals to Bahrain. At the present time, and until the difficulty in obtaining essential food supplies from outside ceases, His Highness believes that it is essential that the import of tea and sugar should be in the hands of the Government. In the past when the merchants imported tea, which they stored on their own premises, there was a serious was imported by merchants and the quantity which they eventually declared in their possession was said by them to be due to loss through natural causes, through broken cases, damage by rats, etc. etc. When the tea was held by theGovermie nt it was found that these losses did not occur. His Highness thinks it is inevitable, if tea supplies are held by individual merchants, that some of it will disappear, not from H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. \ Fite. .: x. Memorandum; - rnatural causQS but bacausQ tbo black mark©t prico of tea is so high that pilfering must occur. Further it has been found in the past that the merchants who presented the petition about tea to the Bahrain Government have constantly produced shipping documents and invoices for tea in which the prices and costs have been so high and have borne such little relation to eachother that His Highness has been compelled to assume that the invoices were incorrect. The Bahrain Government will gladly relinquish the controls on trade as soon as the food position becomes easier but Mi the present time when the geiioial situation to be no better than it was during the war £5^ does not appear to be a suitable moment for relaxing the Governments control on the import ot a commodity upon which many other essential imports depend. These views apply only to the Bahrain quota, the quota for Saudi Arabia is a matter over which the Bahrain Government has no control and His Highness suggests that perhaps you would decide to whom the Saudi Arabia quota should be allotted. His Highness finds it difficult to believe that the merchants who presented the petition have in reality suffered financially from the trade restric tions which were imposed during the war. It is known to him that many of them, on the contrary, have acquired great prosperity from trade during the war.

I enclose copy of a letter dated the 2t&gt;th May 1046, which I have received from Messrs Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co., Bombay, in which they advise that they have received a request -from the Government of Bahrein to buy and ship to Bahrein that Governments tea quota for 1946-4? of 550,000 lbs. As you are aware shipments to the Arab Sheikc oras comprising Bahrein islands. Eastern Saudi Arabia., Ku ait and Muscat and Trucial Oman are handled by the Persian Gulf States Pool which consists of the principal pre-war exporters ana it is not possible to arrange for shipment^to be handled by any firms who are not included in the Pool. It is not at all likely that the Government of India would be prepared to agree to any modification in the present arrangements which would have the effect of discontinuing shipments by the normal pre-war exporters, to the Persian Gulf States.

IP/D/119 16th October, 1946 Dear Miss Cook, I refer to Mr. .Amos’s letter to Miss Clibbon of 26th September, regarding Cable 8211 from the Government of India about tea for the Arab Sheikhdoms. The position is that of the quotas originally recommended by the Tea Committee for these territories, Bahrain and Koweit have still the full amount to draw from the current Indian crop; Tracial Oman has 70,863 lbs. to draw after having been debited with frustrated tea; and Muscat has nothing at all left to In the circumstances, the Tea Committee, at a meeting on 10th October, did not feel able to recommend any increase to Bahrain or Koweit, but in view of representations made that Muscat and Trucial had exhausted their quota without full realisation of the consequences, a special increase of 50,000 lbs, each from the current crop was recommended. This recommendation is subject to the approval of the International Emergency Food Council, but there is no reason to think that approval will be withhold. The following is the amount of tea which each territory may draw from the 3 urrent Indian crop, and the Tea Controller /has iss M.L.Cook, India Office, Matthew Parker Street, Westminster, S.W. 1.&lt;S&gt;{$ INV/ARD TELEGRAM Allotted to Economic Department Copies circulated CONFIDENTIAL CODE TEEEGRAI.I PiOi: Government of India, Commerce Department To: Secretary of State for India Dated New Delhi, 03-M3 hours, 13th October 1946.

PRESS COMMUNIOITE DISCOJTTINUANCE of tea block purchase scheme BAF ON PRIVATE EXPORT OF TEA TO BE WITHDRAWN In a Press Communique irsued on December!, 1^46, the Government of India announced their decision that with the end of the current contract, the Tea Block Purchase Scheme will not be renewed and that the ban on private exports of tea will also bp vi thdrawn from January 1, 1947* It was also announced that the question of continuing the system of destinational quotas was receiving the consideration of the Government of India. A v ’e question has been further considered by the Government of India who have now come to the conclusion that a system of destine.tionsl quotas would not be to the interests either of the consuming countries or the Indian Tea Industry. The Government of India have therefore decided not to continue the destinational quota system when the ban on private exports of tea is withdrawn from January l,!^?. In order, however, to ensure an adequate reserve of tea for internal consumption, it is considered necessary to restrict the issue of export licences under the Indian Tea Con trol Act, 1338, up to such time as the new crop of 1347 comes Jta. into the market. Exporters who are in actual possession of tea as well as of the requisite valid export quota or special export licence should submit applications to the Joint Controllers, Indian bee Licensing Committee, Calcuttjand Coonoor, for North and South Inoia respectively, as the case may be, upto the 10th of each month. l icences will beiasued or released on pro rata , basis, if necessary, by the Joint Controllers, Indian Tea Licensing Committee during the remainder of the month. A he extent up«o which the Joint Controllers will be empowered to issue or release licences each month will be 4 million lbs. each for North and bouth India, pending further notice.

Sir, Appending hereto a letter addressed to The Food Controller, the perusal of which will give an idea of the tea market position. /V Very recently last year’s allotment quota tea has arrived in this port 'fqr local consumption for rationing which will atleast last seme months. The rate of the above tea fixed is Rs»l/l2/- . iiX-quota tea after export restrictions were relaxed the lowest rate till day as sanctioned by the controller in confirmity with the existing rules is Rs12/12/- per lb. i.e. minimum difference of Rsil/-/- per lb. hence so long the quota cheaper tea is available naturally there is expected to be no local demand, As mentioned in our application (oc.l) the markets are falling down at producing centres. In support whereof copy of a telegram (3x.2) received by us is enclosed. In absence of any local demand there is no go but to sell for export. In viev/ of the fact that the rates are falling down the merchants will have to suffer if their stocks remain unsold. ^s there is a reasonable stock for some months for consumption it will be quite unsafe to hold the stocks on hand till the rationed stuff is exhausted and then alone there may be some local demand. But in the meantime the rates are falling and on arrival of the cheaper rates stuff, naturally the rates fixedHead Office: -'iP* KAKOOMAL VALABDAS BROTHERS Telegrams:* 'RAMBROS Bankers.

The scarcity of the place in the shed is not on account of arrivals of large stocks of goods but has been created by the Bahrein Government by permanently storing their wheat there and thus occupying more than half of the available space in the shed* Government cannot compel others to suffer for saving their goods and thus your contention of not accepting the responsibility of loss or damage is according to us unvalid as you cannot make others to suffer for saving Government goods. h ^ 1 lk/g.

Tea is a valuablecargo and in the present case major portion of it taa marked Bahrein in transit, which lA^ISo^be stored in the shed for 90 days, still why the same was chosen to be Atored in the open,under rain, is a question which could best be answered by the Director of Customs as he had acted contrary to the very procedure described by him by taking to shed the cargo of the steamers arrived on the pier many many days after the said tea which was kept lying in the open, though landed on the pier many d&amp;ys before. The plea of scarcity of space could not^under the circumtances, be applicable to it thus it is clear that the same v/as knowingly stored in the open. (2) #e think that by making demand for eompensation we have made no crime for which we should be victimised but Customs take it as a crime, as we have been given a punishme nt by not only selecting our chillies from the cargo of s.s.BARPSTA, for storage in the open but keeping the same without proper cover *iiX.D w shows the same and ’•SX.B” written by the^Customs in reply to our *£X.D* never denies that, thus it is a clear proof for the./ same. &amp; *2X.M m show that in order to hide the damage caused to our chillies Customsr have removed the damaged gunny bags and replaced the same by other bags the reason for the same is very astonishing.

(3) Have the Customs any right to create artificial shortage of space and then make others suffer; is another question to be decided by your Honour. (4) Being Indians we are represented here by your Honour through whom we are entitled to get redress of our legitimate grievances and protection of our rights. The enclosed correspondence will convince your Honour that it has been established that our tea in question was purposely stored in the open and thus the damage was caused to it hence our demand for compensation for the same is legitimate and hope that you will get us the said amount of Rs,l800/«* recovered.

The tea in question was stoned on the pier, owing to lack of space at the time within the pier sheds. The tea was adequately covered with tarpaulins and at no time was it left uncovered. Together with this consignment and stored in the same place were some 1200 cases of tea belonging to eight other importers. These importers took over their tea and no complaint that any of it was damaged has been made to the customs. 2. The Director of Customs contends that the tea in question was not damaged. He suggests that the cases should be opened and examined by an impartial witness. Regarding responsibility, Section 28 of the Bahrain Customs Ordinance states as follows:- 'No owner of goods shall be entitled to claim rom any customs officer compensation for whfi S o 0 +- darna 2 e whic h his goods may suffer while they are lawfully detained on the customs premises unless it be proved that wnf^^rV?? 86 * by the ne g lec t or the wiliut act of the customs officerV 4.

THE eastern bank ltd. BAHRAIN. 10 th May, 1949 . In continuaticn of our application of 11th ultimo regarding the above we were personally £ sent for by the Supdt of the Agency on 4th instant and informed about the reply given by the Bahrein Govt, to our above application. A perusal of the whole correspondance and the reply of Bahrein Govt, proves beyond shadow of doubt that the Tea in question had been willfully kept in the open and thus Bahrein Customs were liable for the compensation of damage thus caused. Following is reply to the points raised by Bahrein Govt. (1) They claim that the Tea in question was well covered with tarpulins and was kept outside on account of scarcity of space in shed.The plea of scarcity of space is not applicable as the correspondance proves that this particular steamer was chosen to be kept outside and the cargo of other steamers which arrived here thereafter was removed to the shed ex EX'D* clearly shows that and the Customs have not denied that; had there been scarcity of space how the cargo of other steamers which arrived here latetywas kept in the shed. A question why this cargo was kept outside has neither been replied nor any explanation is given thus it is clear -I that it had been purposely kept outside. Tarpulins could not protect for a long time goods kept under rain, but can be used for emergency. act (2) Section 28 of Bahrein Customs/clearly says that no compensation is to be given unless caused through neglect or willfully done. In this case it has been done willfully as the Director of Customs in his letter of 3rd March EX’B* clearly 8ay8,* lifill you kindly note that the same will be renoved to shed in order of arrival on pier. *but in action he had not done so as he had chosen this particular steamer to be kept outside under rain etc. and thus acted in contravention of his writing and the cargo which arrived on pier many days after this J was removed to the shed hence it is beyond doubt that it had been willfully kept there thus they are bound to pay the compensation for the damage caused thereby. (3) is no exaggeration to say that at present there is autocratic regime in Bahrein Customs and if one dares to say a word about his rights he is given as much trouble as possible our example is an indication leaving aside the harrassment in day to day routine work our chillies (which reached here a few days after our first letter written to Director of * Customs) were not only selected to be stored outside the shed (and till this day a portion of J the same is lying there),but were kept there without proper cover; our letter of 20th March 1949 SX'D* clearly shows that,the same has not been denied by the Director of Customs. Seeing such attitude out of fear of harrassment a few people will dare to claim for compensation. If others have not claimed for compensation that does not prove that the goods were not damaged. (4) Our Tea in question still is in possession of the Customs hence no useful purpose could be served by discussing whether the same have been damaged or not; we are ready to open each and every case and any of them found damaged (whether whole or part) is not be taken delivery by us and the compensation for the same is to be given to us and those not damaged will be taken by us without claiming compensation.This is a simple process which could ascert ain the actual damage and we had suggested the same to the Director of Customs in our letterW-' 1 rs X l KAKOOMAL valabdas brothers: MERCHANT* ft COMMISSION AGENTS, BAHREIN ( P, GULF.) 20th March,1949* The 01rector of Customs ft Port Officer, * * , H H J l K , t c. p Y Sir, Ret our Tee of Pent^kota still stored in open, In continuation of our letter of 5«3*49 regarding the above it appears te ua that a portion of the same have been damaged by mine which be an last night| though the goods in question are lying at your risk hence all the damage thus caused is at your cost but it will not be out of plnco te mention that your remark in your letter Ne*Cus/’isc /80 of 3rd &amp;nrch,1949t' 'ill you kindly note that the same will bo removed to shed in order of arrival on pier etc. etc*j’ uJce rather roisl r ding fte we are at lees to understand hew the turn of tho said ten has still not coma to bo removed to shed while the car e of many ether at sewers arrived thereafter hns been removed to shad* If you think our contention is wrong will you please put light en the matter so as to remove the misunderstanding cre«ted in our mind* Of nil the cargo landed by s#s.Bnrpeta Vey*358 only our chillies marked • V* R/ Bahrein Intrnnsit have been selected to be stored in the t open without even proper \ cover,for obvious ran sons,and thus it nppenrs that a portion of the same too hns been damaged ;as already informed to you the same toe are lying at your risk hence the damage caused to them is at your cost.
