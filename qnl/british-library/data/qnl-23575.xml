These goods belong to one Khalfan of Murbat, subject of Sayed Taimur. On 29th Shawal 1353, at 4.30 Arabic time in the night, the said boom ran aground at a place called ^Riq al Jazir T between Mearak and Socotra, near the land. This was due to a mistake committed by the Hiuallim 1 in making measurments. The name of the Nakhuna of the boom is Muhammad bin Sulaiman of Barkuwan. After the boom had ran aground, the Nakhuua, the crew and tne owner of the cargo remained on board. Next morning tney went ashore. On the place tney landed, they found Shaikh fi Us^v-reU^ , Kamad bin Mansur, Ruler of Masedah, who, accompanied by all his followers, went to the boom and looted all the cargo which they took ashore and divided amongst themselves. All the tackles of the boom were taken away oy Snaikh Hamad bin Mansur. I deemed it desirable to bring this to your notice. Usual Ending.Political Agency, No:1047. Eanrain, the lltn June 1935.
