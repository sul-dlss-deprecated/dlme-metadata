The following is an excerpt from an article entitled 'Iraq safeguards Arab tradition' which the 'Fatal•Arab' of Lamasous issued on the 8th October 1939i '... It is but natural for Iraq to have joined the Demo cracies because the road Germany wants to take Eastward does not end at Bucarest or Constanza. It goes as far as the Tiger f the Euphratus and the Chatt Al Arab. To-day nobody is unaware of Germany's imperial ambitions. Looking back on the relations between Germany and the Ottoman Empire one can see that the commer- cial and economic agreements between the two countries were chiefly signed by Germany to enable her to reach Iraq and the Arab States of the Chatt Al Arab. The military german maps for 1940 clearly show the ambitious aims of Germany in the Near-Bast.'J 3 RIENT A.RA.BE VGENCB DE PRESSE RUE SOLIMAN PACHA TiL^PHONE 56350 LE CAIRE s ja\A\ _ U.I ^jLi r\ «n r«• j M LA BOURS EGYPTIENNE' 10th November 1939 'Havas” issued on the 10th November 1939 an item which was reproduced by most of the french and arab press of Egypt.

The British authorities are now studying the military reforms to be introduced in Kuwait so as to guarantee its safety. The proposed creation of new ports would be of great importance considering Kuwait’s geographical position at the end of the Persian Gulf and its communications with Iraq on one side and Saudi Arabia on the other. A Congress of British technicians will probably be held in thnis connection. It is also possible that King Ibn Saud will pay a visit to Kuwait after the Ramadan, on his way back from the frontier to which he will see his guest the Amir Fawaz Chaalan.'L* ORIENT A.RA.BE AGENCE DE PRESSE 39, RUE SOLIMAN PACHA TELEPHONE 66350 LE CAIRE Oyiliil _ U-l «*\ r o. j yi; &amp;***. d ■AL TMIOM l* (Baghdad) 1st Qqtober 1&amp;39 » j ijW The Iraqi newspapers issued on the 1st October 1939 a tele- gram from London containing the text of the message sent to H.&amp;. the King by the Shaikh of Bahrein.
