Oornhill 3438 How to make a Will, etc idOW TO MAKfi A WIOL. j State as simply and concisely as possible, and without any attempt at legal phraseology the manner in which you desire to dispose of your property. Careful attention to the following remarks will supply so much of the Law as is necessary for an ordinary will. Particular attention must be paid to the legal formalities required in the execution of the will. Codicils should never be attempted by non-professional persons ; it is, in fact, gener ally easier to re-write the will than to make a codicil. All property may be disposed of by will; but no person under the age of twenty-one years can make a will. livery Woman married afterthe ist January, 1883, can, on attaining twenty-one, make a will disposing of all real and personal property which belonged to her at her marriage, or has been acquired by her, or has devolved upon her since her marriage ; and any Woman married before the ist January, 1883, can make a will disposing of property belonging to her for her separate use, or over which she has a testamentary power of appointment, and can also make a will of all real and personal property, her title to which shall accrue after the ist January, 1883. Every will should be signed at the foot or end thereof (that is immediately under the last line of it and without leaving any space between the last line and the name), by the person making it, or by some other person,in his presence and by his direction ; such signature must be in the presence of two witnesses at least, who should sign their names and addresses against the attestation clause before leaving the Testator’s presence; and against every alteration and interlineation, made before the will is executed, the Testator and the Witnesses must sign their names ; nothing should be scratched out, or erased, or the will might be held incapable of proof. A person, or the wife or husband of a person who takes anything under the will, should not be a Witness : for though the will would not be affected thereby, the gift to such person, or to the wife or husband of such person would be altogether void. An Executor may be a Witness, though it is better that he should not be one, as any legacy to him would thereby be made void. A legacy to a friend is made void or “ lapses ” by his death before the testator’s, but a legacy to a testator’s child does not lapse by his death, if such child leaves issue living at the testator’s death, in which case the legacy goes to the child’s executors or administrators. A concise and Legal Form of a Will may be bad of the Publishers of this Book. Price 6 d. ; by letter post 7 stamps. PROVING WILLS.

Entries start from 2 January and end at 31 December (some dates in between these dates do not have any entries). The entries are usually brief (although entries for some dates run over into the space for the entry for the next date).Apart from brief references to the weather, Hirtzel’s attendance at church services, and other personal matters, Hirtzel’s diary entries mostly concern John Morley (Viscount Morley of Blackburn, Secretary of State for India, referred to as ‘J.M.’ throughout). The entries mainly record the following: the views and opinions expressed by Morley on various issues, largely relating to India and India Office business, and individuals (as recorded by Hirtzel); meetings between Morley and various individuals; Cabinet and Committee meetings and other events attended by Morley; conversations between Hirtzel and Morley (including Morley informing Hirtzel that he had recommended him for the Companion of the Order of the Bath, 18 June, folio 69 verso); and Morley’s moods, emotions and health (as recorded by Hirtzel).The diary includes entries relating to Morley’s views on matters including: India’s military requirements (5 and 8 January, folio 20 verso); the proposal of the Viceroy of India the Earl of Minto (Gilbert John Elliot Murray Kynynmound) to appoint an Indian member to the Viceroy’s executive council (8 April, folio 48 verso; 18 April, folio 52 verso; and 22 April, folio 52 verso); the visit of the Amir [Emir] of Afghanistan Habibullah Khan to India (9 January, folio 20 verso; 12 and 13 January, folio 31 verso); and the visit of the German Emperor (Kaiser Wilhelm II to the United Kingdom (15 November, folio 117 recto).The volume itself is a
