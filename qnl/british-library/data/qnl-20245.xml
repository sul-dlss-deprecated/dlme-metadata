The King in fact naively says n I made the suggestion that you should raise your Kuwait Customs rates to the level of those of Saudi yeh, for no other purpose than to make both our countries one in sraall and great matters, see ing that you and your people are also Hejdis and of our own flesh and blood. If you do not like my idea, why, we will drop it, and revert to the status quo, the Blockade , , 3./ ill /&gt;'- E - So In other v /ords the King would appear to frankly offer Kuwait one of two courses: (a) To come under his suzerainty once for all and win peace and contentment; or (b) To continue being blockaded, and live face to face with ruin, as the eventual prospect- 4 # Under the surface there also is a cunning appeal to the Shaikh and the people of Kuwait to remember that family ties are worth more than nationalistic ideas, and that as Nejdis by blood they should appreciate the situation and not r kick against the pricks 1 any longer• 5. Nevertheless on the whole the King * s reply is very reasonably worded. He no doubt wishes to put the Shaikh off, for the time being, with 'soft* words, seeing that at the present moment he is apparently busily engaged in preparing for his coming war with Yemen, and naturally wants to make sure that he leaves a friendly Kuwait in his rear. 6 # The King T s f, pious tr declaration in the last line of his letter that he will never agree to Kuwait being in jured, is typical , and would be amusing, were it not tragic. Although the Shaikh is far too proud to ever own it openly the last 9 years of continual blockade has brought Kuwait very near indeed to her knees. Only persons like myself who live on the spot and are in touch with realities know the true state of affairs. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait000 y'b Translation of letter No•308, dated the 17th Jamad Awal 1552 (7.9.33) from H.M.King Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman as Saud, King of, Saudiyeh Arabia, to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as Subah, K.G.I.-l.

My Erotherl You should know that we were not insistent on the matter (i.e. of the raising of ivuwait customs to the level of ours). We made the suggestion for no other purpose, than to make the countries as one in small as well as in more important matters, seeing that their inhabitants were one and of the same stock. We in deed do not seekjanything but friendly intercourse (Mubadala) ,only desire and to/preserve the interests of all. If you agree to our proposal, we are ready to work it.

Government of India, Foreign and political Department. A b0 Koweit blockade. Assumptions in paras. 2 and 3 are correct. 'While we are prepared to make strong representations to Ibn Saud with a view to secure raising of blockade we naturally cannot guarantee that we should succeed, or that Ibn Saud could be compelled to implement agreement. As for _ Vt .&lt;l0POint in (c) of that telegram,position as we see it is that Sheikh has already compromised his claims (save possibly personal claim) against Ibn Saud beyond hope by his indiscreet personal correspondence and that it is no longer a question of his 'having to sign away his just claims and in the end have nothing to show for it'. 2. At the same time, while responsibility for present impasse in our view now rests with Sheikh, we are reluctant, having regard to pledges given by us in 1929 and importance on general grounds of supporting him against Ibn Saud, to let matter drop without further determined effort to persuade him to adopt more reasonable attitude. We suggest for your consideration possibility of approach to him on following lines. That His Majesty's Government are most anxious to secure raising of blockade and, as they have already indicated/2. (Continuation Sheet.) ^ EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL). indicated, are prepared to press matter with Ibn Saud, On the other hand, imipasse has now heen reached with His Majesty owing to private correspondence conducted by the Sheikh direct with the King without the knowledge of His Majesty's Government. While the Sheikh contests Ihn Saud ? s interpretation of that correspondence , he has been reluctant to pursue matter with Ibn Saud and latter refused to pursue negotiations on ground that presentation of claims 'shows clear disregard by Koweit of international agreements and it is no use considering further agreements if such agreements are not respected'. Responsibility for delay does not, therefore, in these circumstances rest with His Majesty's Government. It is clear, moreover, that unless Sheikh is either now or in the future prepared to contest interpretation of correspondence in question position of his claims, save possibly personal loan, must be regarded as hopelessly compromised. His Majesty's Government in these circumstances feel that in Sheikh's own interests it is essential to dispose of question of claims. They would propose therefore to inform Ibn Saud that while Sheikh does not agree with his interpretation of earlier correspondence he does not wish to contest matter with him and is prepared to drop claims other than personal'.loan. His Majesty's Government would thereafter endeavour to secure satisfactory settlement on basis of Sheikh's own proposals for establishment of customs posts. 3. Unless you see objection to action on these lines or can suggest any alternative (in which case we should be glad of telegraphic report) we suggest that matter might be discussed by you with Sheikh before you proceed on leave/3.

Such general conversations v /ould naturally include discussions in a friendly spirit of the two major questions vizs 1. The 1913-14 Line and 2. Blockade of Kuwait, which requires settlement 9 /LxyK. ^ , . , relations between Saudi Government2 entirely smiaoth and satisfactory. 3. As regards 1 you may inform i'bn Saud that if he will cease to contest the undoubted validity sdbdsto in international law of the 1913-14 Line His Majesty's GoverntDent will be prepared, as in the earlier case of Kuwait, to consider sympathetically and to authorise you to discuss on your return any reasobable proposal for minor adjustments. You might suggest that now that his achievements have brought his country into the circle of fully independent and properly constit- -uted States he cannot ? merely seek to set aside generally accepted principles of international law which govern relations between such itates . It would be impossible for His Majesty's Government to discuss the boundary question on any other basis. 4«. As regards 2 you should merely indicate that the ta: obligations of His Majesty^ Government towards the Shaikh make it impossible to consider their relations with Ibn Saud as entirely satisfactory until some method is found of alleviating the damaging effects of the blockade upon the Shaikhdom. Should the King raise the question of the Shaikhs claims ( regarding which position has not yet been cleared up with Shaikh ) you may say that His Majesty's Government agree that this matter must be settled also. 5. His Majesty's Government will be glad to con- -sider any proposals on these tv/o points which His Majesty can communicate to them while you are on leave in order that on your return to Jedda you may be in possession of full instructions to enable you to discuss settlement of both. 6. As regards desiderata of ibn Saud, since they are uncertain you can only take note of them for report to me. But if, as seems likely, his main desire is for some tightening of ties of friendship, while you should bear in mind the caution prescribed in my telegram Ho. 18, you5 iv \ you may act on the assumption that if individual questions of importance can 'be satisfactorily settled His Majesty's Government would be ready to subscribe to formula expressing special degree of close friend- -ship with Saudi Government short of alliance. ?•. I leave you to adapt and make the best use you can of the above material in the circumstances of the moment. 8. As regards other possible points. I have no furlher instructions to give you regarding the Eeutral Zone oil Concession. The communication outlined in my telegram Mo. 19 has not yet been made to the Syndicate. It is still desirable to gain time for the Iraq Petroleum Company pending completion of the Kuwait Oil Company*s negotiations, see my telegram Mo. 122, and since neither the Standard Oil Company of California nor the Syndicate have yet come to terms with the Saudi Government no step appears necessary upon our side. 9.

After consultation with itowle and Ryan His Majesty^ Government have reached fo llowing conclu- -sions. (a) As proposal (originating with Ibn Sa^d) for investigation by commissioners has been formally put to Sa^di Government ?/ith the concurrence of Shaikh and never withdrawn rejected (Jedda despatch ho . 353 of 19th August 1932) it seems necessary on resuming discussions to put it forward ?ag ain in the first instance. If Sa 'udis now reject it or if it is tried and fails, matter can be proceeded with by direct discussion between Ryan and £&gt;a f udis. (b) Shaikh to be informed in writing that in the nature of the case it is impossible for His Majesty's Government to give an assure -ance that these negotiations with Ibn Sa t ud2 Sa^d will be successful but that they will use their best endeavours to secure a satis- -factory settlement for him on the basis (if preliminary negotiations between commissioners appointed by Kuwait and 3a f udi Arabia do not materialise or prove successful) of Shaikh's own proposal for establishment of customs posts. (c) It is however an essential preliminary for rea- -sona set out in my Express Letter of June 2Snd, P.Z.31919/34 that the Shaikh's claims against Jbn other than personal claims be dropped. Shaikh Sa^d/should be informed on this point that His Majesty's Government propose to infona Ibn Sa^d that while the Shaikh does not agree with his in- -terpretation of earlier correspondence he does not wish to contest matter with him and is pre- -pared to drop claims other than personal loan. It should be made clear to the Shaikh that His Majesty's Government feel it is essential in his own interests to dispose of the question of claims which are decisive obstacles in disposing of block- -ade question. His Majesty's Government regard his private correspondence with ibn Sa'ud as having made it hopeless for him to pursue this question save as regards personal claim and accordingly pro- -pose to deal with question on the above lines. Explanations on this point may be oral or written at the discretion of the Political Hesident. If you aee no objection please take action accordingly at the earliest good opportunity. It is of somesome urgency to clear the ground with the Shaikh as the matter may figure prominently in negotia nt ions with Sa'udi Government after Ryan•s return for action however you should also have regard to any risk there may be that the effects of the pro- -posed communication on the Shaikh might cause him to react unfavourably in other directions for ex- -ample the oil negotiations. to Jedda in December In choosing moment Secretary of State for India.I GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, FIDENTIAL .

It means, I think, that Hafith Wahba will be in Kuwait somewhere about 15th December. 3. Clearly his visit has been timed to coincide with X&gt; &lt;X -A .£X -C. Bin Saud's so called hunting expedition round al Faraih f (See my telegram of todays date). 4. The Shaikh, who I saw this morning thinks that Bin Saud may possibly move up into the Gara'a region North of Safa where there are many gazelle and lots of Hubara, that is to say some 100 miles from Kuwait. He may even camp at our old friend 'Khabari Wadtha* where water pools are reported to be plentiful. 5. A Kuwaiti notable, one Marzuk al Badr of Anaze stock who visited Bin Saud at Riath on 17th and returned to Kuwait on Monday night (26•11.34) told the Shaikh (this I had from the Shaikh also today) that Bin Saud talked long and late with him, about his ancient love and friendship for the Al Subah and especially for his dear Shaikh Ahmad, who from boyhood he had treated like a younger brother etc. etc. That he had been forced to blockade Kuwait against his will etc. etc., but by God if only Ahmad would pay him even a annual §mall/amount as a sort of annual n Xmas Box' he would certainly renounce the Blockade. o-M- So^Cr '' 6. Marzuk al Badr on the top of^this sort of ifeoM stuff told the Shaikh that Bin Saud talked much about his desire to arrange a real friendly 'entente' with the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf, and hoped Ahmad would not be backward in coming forward/ \ Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R S .2 forward. ?• The Shaikh opined and I agree with him that in view of the above,interesting happenings may be in the wind, and that possibly Bin Saud may sound him with Tf alliance ft or ^entente' talk shortly, and that Hafith Wahba's coming visit ha^Lall been planned some time ago» 8. The Shaikh says he is quite certain that the whole thing denotes a typical Bin Saud attempt to lead His Majesty's Government, neighbouring Arab States, and especially his own very dissatisfied tribes, away fran realities, and make them think that he has come out of the Yemen War with great^strength than ever, when in truth his position was most 'Shaky', and his prestige internally badly impaired^ The Shaikh insists that this loss of prestige is behind every thing and that Bin Saud's one aim just now is to rehabilitate himself with his own people, by leading their thoughts else where. I agree with this view. It will be interesting to see what the next few weeks bring us. One thing is certain, Ahmad is not a bit anxious to see the Blockade question opened while 'Oil' and 'G-ardens' questions are where they are now. He was very emphatic about this today.xi/jty Telegram R*27 Prom political Resident^ Buahire* To H .M , a Secretary of State for India, London* Ccpy by post Government of India, foreign and Political Department, lew DelM# Political Agent, Kuwait• Ko. 1177 Dated 5th December 1934. try X r Dickson has received a private letter from Hafiz Wahba that latter is visiting Kuwait short- -ly.

This, always provided, that Bin Saud- 2 - 7&lt; that Bin saud will receive His Majesty f s Government's advances in a friendly and accommodating spirit, means business, and will agree to raise the Blockade, and in place of same establish one or more customs posts on his side of the frontier• Should however Bin Saud 'harden his heart', and in spite of all efforts of His Majesty's G-ovemment, should he refuse to agree to a settlement on the above lines, then he (the Shaikh) feels bound to say now, that the situation must be considered as remaining unchanged and Kuwait 'Claims' against Bin Saud (which are not his own K but those of his people) shall be exactly in the same position as they were before the negotiations started: He puts it this way as he does not wish to start a fresh dispute with the King over 'Claims' and so spoil the good relations that exist* He (the Shaikh) never had, and still has no faith whatsoever in the Blockade impasse being settled by means of selected Arab 'Commissioners', but if His Majesty's Government desire to give the idea a preliminary trial, he will raise no objection, though he reiterates his previous warning that such Commissioners 1 efforts must from the nature of things prove abortive* He (Shaikh) reiterates his conviction that if His Majesty's Government will seriously deal with the matter themselves, the blockade problem will be easily and satisfactorily solved,. (The implication here is, that no amount of persuasive eloquence will be of any use with the King, but that/- 3 - that only a ^firm front' will bring about the favourable reaction necessary for a settlement)♦ 3. My own views are that the Shaikh knows fully well that he has not a ghost of a chance of ever getting money compensation for his 'Claims', but that he wants to be able to justify all he does in this matter to his people. He wants to tell them in open Mejliss if necessary, something of the following nature (We must not forget that we are dealing with an almost Bedouin Democracy where relations between Ruler and ruled are personal)# 'The protecting power have generously offered to 'reopen negotiations with Bin Saud for the removal of 'the Blockade. I have welcomed the idea - I have 'gone further and have offered to abandon all your 'and my just 'claims' against the King,for damage 'and destruction caused by his Akhwan forces in the 'past, to prove that for our part, we are imbued 'with the fullest good will and are prepared to bury 'the past for ever. I have made the condition, however, 'that Bin Saud shows equal good will and genuinely 'attempts to meet our advance by an equal act of 'generosity. Should he agree to replace his Blockade 'by one or more customs posts on the frontier as the 'protecting power is going to ask him to do, then 'all is well - If he is not willing to meet the 'protecting power's proposals and rejects our advances, 'then all that is left for us to do is to withdraw our 'offer in the matter of 'claims' and put our reliance 'in God and ask Him to recover them for us in his 'good time'. 4. In my opinion. His Majesty's Government need not worry much at this stage about the Shaikh's 'claims' proviso and attempt to safeguard himself with his people. They should go ahead, I think, and tell Bin Saud that the Shaikh is ready to show his good will by dropping the 'claims',4 9o 'claims', which he has hitherto inade / as a preliminary to negotiations being opened* 5. But if negotiations showed definite signs of going wrong or of failing altogether, His Majesty f s G-overnment should then, but only the, say to the King, that they felt it would only be fair to advise the Shaikh to with draw his offer to drop his claims on the grounds that he would find it most difficult to deal with his subjects, and explain away how it was that he had given away their chance of getting back 'blood money' for relatives killed^and money compensation for looted camels, sheep, horses ; and had got nothing for them in return* I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant 3V • Lt»-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait VSS.Copy of a confidential letter No.C-18, dated the 18th January 1935, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait. After Compliments, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency ohat His Majesty's Government have informed me through the Hon•hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that they have decided to reopen negotiations with His Majesty King Bin 3aud, on the subject of the Kuwait Blockade. 2. Your Excellency will recollect that at the end of March 1934, and acting under instructions of His Majesty's Government, I had several discussions with you over this selfsame blockade question, and I infoimed you then that His Majesty's Government could not again start negotiations with Bin Saud, as they were ready and anxious to do, unless Your Excellency agreed to abandon the 'Claims' which you had made against the King in respect of damage i n; fll Q ted by the Akhwan. This was because of Bin Saud's difficult attitude in the matter, and because of his Insistence that Your Excellency had agreed to bury all past claims as between Nejd and Kuwait in 1932. 3. As a result of our discussions Your Excellency on 3rd April |934 intimated to me your entire willingness to abandon all your 'claims', with the exception of the Personal Loan m_ade to Bin Saud by you on the occasion of the Hall Expedition, provided that His Majesty's Government would give you some sort of general assurance that the negotiations with Bin Saud would be pressed to a successful conclusion. I duly informed His Majesty's Government of what Your Excellency said. 4. His Majesty's Government have now directed me to Inform Your Excellency that, in the nature of the case, it is quite impossible for them to give you an assurance that their negotiations with Bin Saud will be successful,- 2 - 9-^ successful, but that they will use their best endeavours to secure a satisfactory settlement of this question for Your Excellency, on the basis of Your Excellency^ own proposals for the establishment of one or more Customs posts etc. (If preliminary negotiations between Commissioners appointed by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia - this was agreed to by Your Excellency, vide your letter No.R-381, / dated 4th Dhil Hujjah 1350 (1CU4.52) - do not materialize or prove unsuccessful)• 5. Regarding Your Excellency f s '•claims n against Bin Saud: His Majesty^ Government propose to inform the latter that while Your Excellency does not agree to the interpretation of earlier correspondence (i.e. the words Talabat and Da'awi), Your Excellency does not wish to contest the matter with him, and further, is prepared to drop all claims, with the exception of the personal loan referred to in paragraph (2) above. 1 6. Moreover, His Majesty's Government feel it essentia in Your Excellency's own interests, that you should abandon this question of claims altogether, which in the eyes of Bin Saud is a decisive obstacle to the disposal of the Blockade question: Indeed His Majesty's Government regard Your Excellency's private correspondence with Bin Saud on the subject of these 'claims', as having made it quite hopeless for Your Excellency to raise this question, through them, with the exception of course of Jour 'Personal' claims. Accordingly His Majesty's Government propose to deal with the matter on the lines mentioned above. Usual Ending.2./ Translation of a confidential letter No.R -4/1900, dated the 15th Shauwal 1355, corresponding to the 20th January 1935, from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After compliments, I have with pleasure received your letter No»G-18, dated the 13th Shauwal 1353 (18.1.35), and have understood your statement in respect of the information (Lit: news) that you have received from His Majesty^ Government, through the Hon *hie the Political Resident, and of His Majesty's Government's decision relative to the matter of opening negotiations with His Majesty King Abdul Aziz bin Saud on the subject of the Kuwait Blockade. In view of the lengthy discussions which have taken place between you and myself on this selfsame question, and in consideration of His Majesty's Government's present proposals, I agree to abandon all past claims between Nejd and Kuwait, with the exception of the 'personal loan'.This in the event of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz bin Saud agree ing to raise the Blockade, and to establish one or more customs posts on his side of the frontier. Should however His Majesty not agree to this course, that is to say, to raise the Blockade, then the 'claims' shall remain exactly in the same state as they have hitherto been, as I do not wish to start a fresh dispute with His Majesty about them now. As regards the question of the commissioners dealt with in my reply letter No.381, dated the 4th Dhil Hujjah 01353 (10.4.32): As I have already stated their (the commissioners') efforts to provide a settlement in such a matter as this, must, I fear, prove abortive. But never theless in compliance with His Majesty's Government's proposals, I am willing to agree on this point also, knowing full well that no useful results will ever be derived from t 'their (the Commissioners 1 ) efforts.■9q I am quite sure on the other hand that if His Majesty's Government themselves deal with the negotiations, the case will have a satisfactory ending.

Definition of first alternative is based on my note to ?Saudi Government of ugust i9th, i.932. I have defined second aa follows: * to explore possibility of agreement on one ^articular basis which has been suggested in the past, namely that trade across frontier should be at one or more customs posts in friendly relations with the tribes of His Majesty the King to which all trade should be directed. difficulty. I deduce from previous correspondence that solution really favoured by Shaikh is proposal for a single customs post described at (i) in paragraph 2 of i-oliticcil Agent's report to the Political Resident, No, i26 of 22nd June 1933. ultiple posts were mentioned by Political xtesident in the Inter-departmental Meeting I have today addressed personal letter This second definition has presented some of. 2 - of April 2Sth, 1933 and again in the Shaikh's reply of ugust 28th, 193J to Ibn Saud's proposal for uni fication of customs duties. It is clear that| if Ibn Saud decided to have several posts. Shaikh would take same measure to ensure passage of trade through them as if there were only one ? If Faud agreos to second alternative, I presume further discussion should take place here.

X W Pai*agraph 9 of my telegram Ko.23 referred only to questions of Eastern frontiers and Kuwait Blockade and contemplated simultaneous negotiations not necessarily simultaneous settlement of those but 1 have not yet (?omission) questions. !^y present idea is to run them more or less together without definitely linking them up and to deal with all other questions separately. I am still anxious to give priority to Kuwait Blockade but not to the extent of making settlement of it conditional on settlement regarding Eastern frontiers lest Ibn Saud should think he was being asked Blockade under threat th t failure to do so would cause His Majesty's Government to refuse any compromise regarding frontiers. If you approve, I suggest that His Majesty's Government should take earliest possible decision as to whether they are prepared to offer concession in regard to Eastern frontier nothwithstand^ng Ibn Gaud's refusal to bring it into a general settlement of outstanding questions. I strongly recomend this course as insistence on Blue Line would create hopeless impasse and because of doubt cast on tenability of position by your legal advisers minutes of August 29th. Hafiz /-2- Hafiz Wahba told me on February 19th that he thought King would 'be prepared to meet us half way as regards Eastern frontiers. Me advocates settlement on basis of allocating tribes and seexae to think that such allocation would be as adequate our previous division tliough on this point his language was vague. He admitted that Saudi pretentions regarding tribes might be excessive and suggested that experts would nave nothing difficult in allocating them fairly* Hafis Wahba represented Kuwait Blockade question as much more difficult but assured me that customs posts would really be too and would not prevent smuggling* He urged payment in lump sum by Shaikh of Kuwait to Ibn Saud in respect of duty on goods destined icr Mejdt I explained Shaikh 1 s objection to this* I started conversation with Fuad on February 20th by reading formal statemeirb of text which is given in my immediately succeeding telegram, I explained that though oral it represented definite view of His Majesty's Government as telegraphed to me. iuad copied o t its exact terms. He offered no comment but presently reverted to question reproduced in paragraph 2 of my telegram Ko .23. I parried adding however that I h^d so far no detailed instructions as position had to be reconsidered in the light of his comi-amication of February 7th regarding King 1 s general negotiations. It is easy enough to refuse to entertain Fuad's question on the technical ground that His Majesty's Government alone are concerned but on wider political grounds I consider it important to meet it in manner which will t .ke some account of Arab sentiment and also to be prepared with answer to question suggested in paragraph 4 of my despatch No *28 • In my conversation with Fuad I emphasised urgency of Kuwait Blockade question and importance attached to it by His /His Majesty*s Goveinment who would like to see it settled in advance ol anything else# Further report follows by despatch. -RYAH-UJU air Tele gram XX 5*oin H.M'e.

I do not exactly see, however, what pressure the delegates can bring to bear on members of the Shaikh^ family (paragraph 2 of your telegram No.90), and in any case it is up to the Shaikh to counteract the delegates 1 influence with his own family in whatever way he thinks fit. 3, The Shaikh has been already hoodwinked at least once by Bin Saud in the matter of the Claims correspondence and so should be on his guard against similar sharp practice in the future.

Saw Shaikh last night and found him in much better spirits and far more reasonable over delegates question. After a long heart to heart talk with most satisfactory results I communicated your message. Shaikh immediately admitted that he had acted hastily but said that he had been very worried of late over his date gardens and recent theft from Basra Court archives of famous Power of Attorney recovered from Constantinople (see Intelligence Summary in m^t. ). On top of this Philby's arrival had filled him with acute anxiety as he felt sure latter was working for Standard Oil Company and under orders of Ibn Saud would attempt to introduce oil and Neutral Zone into blockade proceedings as it is bargaining counter* 2. Shaikh asked me to assure you and His Majesty's Government fully that he would receive three Saudi delegates as soon as they chose to arrive and would put them up in his own palace for as long as they liked. Lastly that he would of course carefully examine and weigh every suggestion put forward by them although he must abide by his decision already /-2- already conveyed to His Majesty's Government to concentrate on soluti 0 n on basis of customs posts and manifest system. 3. Reference Neutral Zone Shaikh repeated assurance that he would at once refer any applications from any Oil Company to His Majesty's Government but added in strict confidence that he has no intention of granting a concession for his half interest in Neutral Zone to any one so long as Ibn Saud lived. His policy was sterilization of that area. -Political✓ 63/54 &amp; 86/1 Telegram R.27. From Political Agent, Kuwait. To Political Resident, Bushire. No.100. Dated 11th (received 12th) April 1935.

I enclose translation of the following letters (a) Confidential letter No.0-85 datea 3.4.1935, frojn rayself to H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait. (b) Confidential letter No.R-4/1994 dated 4.4.1935 from H.E. the Shaikh to myself. 2. For your information, after the Shaikh received my letter (a) above, he sent round his Secretary, K.B. Mulla Salih, the same evening to see i|ie, The latter appeared upset and much worried at what he called his master^ 'diffi cult Tf attitude. The Shaikh, he said, had sent for him on receipt of my letter and had told him to go and tell me that he (the Shaikh) wanted to send his Kuwait delegates to Bahrain to meet the Saudi delegates there, as according to him (the Shaikh) this would save time, trouble and expense. k 3. K.B. Mulla Salih said that he had expostulated with the Shaikh and told him that Bin Saud and His Majesty's Government would take such a suggs st ion very unkindly indeed but that the Shaikh3 U(} Shaikh, who had been seedy and very nervy of late, would not listen to him. Having delivered the message, Mulla Salih advised me strongly to go to taolrl© his master the next day. This I did. 4. At my interview (on 4th April) the Shaikh came to the point at onoe and said he wanted to send the Kuwait delegates to Bahrain and not receive the Saudi delegates in Kuwait - I expressed very great surprise at his attitude and told him bluntly that I would be no party to the suggestion at all,and would refuse to telegraph such a foolish proposal to Jedda or to yourself - I then started a regular wordy fight with him, which resulted in his f inally agreeing to write to me and say that he would receive the Commission at once, but that he desired that only the two senior members should come. Tt Th0 discussions Tt , he said, Tt cou ld be carried through better if few men talked ?t . Seeing that he was adamant, I agreed to wire Jedda the gist of the Shaikh's talk with me, (see my telegram No.88). The same evening the Shaikh sent me his letter(enclosed) 5. That the Shaikh is all nerves and unwell these days may be instanced by the fact that when I asked why he did not want all the Saudi delegates to come (we believed them to be four), he shouted out ' /hy should I put up and feed them and their retainers - I have no money these days, I am on the verge of ruin, and all owing to your Government - Put them up yourself in the New Agency^. I replied rather heatedly that I certainly would, if he wished to be stingy. He immediately changed his tone and replied rather pathetically T, forgive me my friend,but I am sick in heart and mind, and the world seems wrong these days. I will do my best, but I feel absolutely certain that Bin Saud has already told his delegates not to agree to the Customs Posts and manifest system,which is the only system I can possibly ^gree to have,and which I have already told your government as much3 as much by formal letter - ihy then should I welcome men who are going to do nothing, nay, are going to try and bring about my ruin'. 6 # The above is sent to give you an idea of how the wind is blowing here, but as I said in my telegram No.90, I think, the real reason (apart from poor health), why the shaikh is difficul is because he is terrified of under hama methods being used against him by the delegates and in particular of a family intrigue being started through Shaikh iibdulJa as Salim and Philbyi the news of whose coming arrival was conveyed to the Shaikh on 3rd April. Jv Lieut-Colonel, Political ngent, Kuwait. i WTER. m Reference (1) Minister Jedda's telegram Noy^' (2) Resident at Bahrain^ telegram No.T114. (3) Secretary of State for India's telegram No. 1116. Zt^ See my telegram No. 99 dated 10th April 19 35. I am adding a few extra notes to my original 'Express Letter' as they may be found of interest, aM are worth putting on record I think. 2. On receipt of telegram (3) above #iich incidently arrived with many mutilations - I called on the Shaikh at 4.30 P.M. on 9th April in his camp at BIYaN (situate some 7 miles from Kuwait). 3. The shalich received me very cordially and after telling me that his wife the Lady Ahmad was getting on well after her recent unpleasant operation,he showed me a telegram which he had just received from Phi lby fromHiath;This was to the ef fe ct|-vCwy ^ 0 4 •- effect that he, Philby, ?/ould arrive about noon on 10th April, and was most anxious to see him, the Shaikh. 4. The Shaikh quite of T, his own hat' then volunteered the information that he believed that Philby was now working for the Standard Oil Company of California and that his visit to Kuwait was certainly, he thought, connected with oil and the Neutral Zone. He felt certain that Philby would try and 'but^ in' to the coming 'Blockade' conversations by orders of the King and that the latter* s intention was probably that Philby should deliver a confidential message scmething of this nature 'I ask you my brother ixhmad, to give your approval for your half interest of the Neutral Zone to be given to the Standard Oil of California, and I Bin Saud will agree to a Blockade settle* ment on the lines of the Customs posts and manifest system or possibly to it (the blockade) being abolished altogether. 5. The Shaikh said that he would never agree at all to such proposal, if made and that so long as Bin Saud lived, he for one had no intention of signing a?/ay any, ri^its of his in the Neutral Zone - (This he told me not to repeat). When I asled him why, he replied that Bin Saud was too dangerous a man to have any share in the Neutral Zone and he preferred, nay was certain, that the best policy for Kuwait was to 'steralize' this particular zone at any rate till the King died. 6. Tbcpanding further, the Shaikh said that so determined was he on this particular policy, that even if His Majesty's Government told him to go ahead and give an oil concession in tbe Neutral Zone to an all British Company, he would not agree, because it would give the King a definite and further stronger hold on Kuwait. (In this connection see a Note on the possibility of dividing the Neutral Zone into two halves which &gt;/56- . i- 1 - 1 ■I prepared for the India Office in September 1934). 7. I here deemed it time to turn the conversation to the coming blockade conference and especially the point of my visit; So after some preliminary haart to heart observations to which the Shaikh reacted extremely well, I read out the gist of telegrams (2) and (3) referred to at the beginning of this Note - in other words I conveyed your message and that of His Majesty's Government. The Shaikh listened very attentively and then disarmed me somewhat by smilingly observing as follows.- 'I see that both Colonel Fowle and His Majesty 1 s Government are justly angry with me for having suggested that two delegates should come to Kuwait only. They need not be however, for I was just on the point of telling you myself today that I myself realised already that I had acted too quickly, and desired to withdraw my remarks to you of the 4th April and also my letter of t he same date (see enclosure) Tt . He then went on to say that he desired me to telegraph to you at once and say that he had decided not only to receive the three Saudi delegates as soon as they were ready to come from Bahrain, but that he would do every honour tojthem, and put them up in his cwn palace and tar as long as they liked. Further that all he had said on the 4th April has been born of panic at hearing that the redoubtable Philby was on his way to Kuwait to try conclusion with him. 8. The Shaikh ended by asking me to be sure to make you and His Majesty's Government happy, on the score of the talks to bejheld with the Saudi delegates. These would be carried on as sweetly as honey (his words) and he (the Shaikh) would of course listen to all the Saudi representatives had to say and would weigh all their proposals in the balance - Yet he felt bound to repeat, added the shaikh, that he must for the s ake of6 /v7 sake of the eventual salvation of his State and his people, concentrate on the Customs posts and inan if est system and make that the major issue. possible alternative, he said, (and he had spent many months and years thinking over the natter) was for Bin baud himself to give him a personal letter under his own seal and signature to the effect that he {Bin Saud) appointed him (Shaikh Ahmad) as his personal collecters of all customs taxes on exports going out fiom Kuwait to Nejd, and that he (Bin Saud) would rely on his brother Ahmad 1 s honour and ?7ord as a noble ^rab, to 'play fair', and should there be good or poor customs returns, he (Bin Saud) would never complain or murmur. 10- I give the above curious suggestion from the Shaikh exactly as he gave it to me - There is a good deal to be said for it, I think, but I agree with the Shaikh that Bin Saud is hardly likely to agree to such a way of settling the trouble, 11. One final and very interesting personal remark of the Shaikh is worth repeating. I t was meant for me only . He said 'In difficult and awkward matters to be solved between Arab States today and always, every effort of a European or a Christian Power, to get than (the contesting parties) to arrive at an understanding, will fail, simply because Arab rulers in such affairs, believed they could manage their own affairs as between themselves as Muslims, much better than if Christians intervened. This was a fixed principle, and need have nothing to do with the question of the moral responsibility of a Protecting Power which was only concerned definitely with illegal, hostile and purely aggressive acts on the part of the neighbour with which the State was at variance. • Lieut-Colonel, Political xxgent, Km;ait.i^r Copy of a confidential letter No.C-85, dated the 3rd April 1935, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I^ Ruler of Kuwait # After compliments.

Certainly Ogilvie Forbes expressed surprise at one or two things which I told him, and said never he had/heard that side of the question at all. 6. He was, I think, particularly impressed by my statement that Kuwait had no manufactures at all, grew no wheat, barley, dates or other cereals, and only produced grass, a few mellons and some sheep and camels - And that her population of 70,000 souls today (with the 2.

Fowle, G .B.S. , Political Resident in the Persian^Gulf,s ziv pearl trade gone) had no means of buying their food and clothing, which all came from India, uless they could sell something to someone. Their merchants, therefore, were compelled, whether they ?7illed or not,to sell goods to all and sundry who came in from the desert to buy, and so lend themselves to the smuggling business with their two powerful neighbours (IRAQ, and Saudiyeh) , simply to get money,otherwise they and the people of Kuwait would die of starvation; Legitimate trade having been denied to them or having been made impossible by very high tariffs, iiligitimate trade had perforce to be resorted to. The whole thing resolved itsel?, literally, I told him, into a question of^life and death' where Kuwait was concerned, whereas it only meant a certain amount of annoying financial loss where her neighbours were concerned. 7. The following are seme of the points I gathered fiom Ogilvie Forbes and Stafford, discussing the matter separately. From Ogilvie Forbes . (a) He admitted that the IRAQ, Army and Police Yfere quite incapable of establishing a string of posts or of guarding the frontier properly, so the Baghdad authorities knowing this preferred to do nothing lest they 'be made a laughing stock of: Their policy was to try and get Kuwait to ft hold the Baby'. (b) He as good as told me that Sievwright and Monk were responsible for the anti Kuwait campaign and not the IRAQIS themselves, and that the threat of 'water' reprisals was their invention entirely. He did not think that the Iraqis would approve such measures but that the above Englishnen with large powers at their disposal, might act without consulting the Government. (c) He said ttat both Sievwright and Monk were'going' at the end of May and he believed the situation would improve then. (d) He Had experienced actual rudeness and lack of desire for co-operation from Sievwri^it on several occasions, more especially wten he asked the latter to see him3 him in connection with the visit of the IRAQ, Custonis launch into Khor Subiyeh and the shooting up of Kuwait wood-cutters 1 boats. (e) On the other hand, he did not seem quite able to appreciate the independent nature of Kuwait, nor the 11 gun Salute of the Shaikh. (f) Nor could he see why the Shaikh would not settle the garden question, by selling his gardens to the IRAQ government. grom Stafford , (a) He appeared much more sympathetic towards Kuwait and the Shaikh generally than his Chief, and admitted that this was perhaps because it had fallen to his lot to deal with the gardens questions from the first. (b) He mentioned in regard to smuggling question the interesting fact that the Basra Customs were forcing all ship Captains on arrival at Basra to disclose exactly what proportion of cargo they had landed at Kuwait. (c) He admitted also that the £ 60,000 smuggling figure, fixed on Kuwait by Sievwright was purely guess work, and not in any way reliable. 8. Lastly Ogilvie Forbes repeated the recent theft from the Basra Court archives, of the now famous Power of Attorney given by 'AWASHA' wife of Ahmad Pasha al Z,uhair in Turkish times, authorizing him to sell her Faddaghiyeh property to Shaikh Mubarak# You recollect, no doubt, that this document was got with much trouble from the Istambul 'Somerset House' Just before the latter was burnt to Ihe ground, and was later handed over by Gabriel, the Shaikh's lawyer for safe keeping to the Basra Court. The document m apparently was cut up with a scissors - and its loss only accidentally discovered; x j? discovered by Judge Lloyd. 9 a I think the visit of Ogilvie Forbes did good, but I confess I was somewhat astonished to find, that much information which to us in Kuwait was comiiion laiowledge seemed quite uniaiown to both Ogilvie Forbes and Stafford#iticKBT D.O.No.106/C * iry POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT. The 13th April 1935 \ / r yT IV l h In continuation of my Secret D.O. No. 104 dated IZth April 1935 re Ogilvie Forbes and Stafford's visit here« i'fc will, Ithink, be of interest to you and His Majesty's Government to learn wbat Pliilby has had to say on the subject of both Kuwait Nejd Smuggling and the probable line the Saudi delegates will take in their coming Blockade discussions « 2. You will tbtis have the point of view of those English men in Baghdad who think that IRAQ has a grievance against Kuwait, as well as the ideas and vie¥/s of a first rate Saudi Champion, The latter, as you will see, is even more emphatic than his northern confreies ; that Kuwait has no rights at all and should cease to exist. 4. Philby's views on' smugglin g' into Nejd from Kuwait were given with candour and frankness, but clearly showed that he had got tbem from prejudiced sources, and that he had only studied the question superficially (he made several statements which were untrue). He admitted that The Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel T.C. Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E. lthat what he said reflected the ideas of the King. 5, ioaonjother things Philby assured me - into ta) That smuggling wi^k Nejd continued to be very heavy, (b) That in spite of this^Bin Baud's blockade was slowly but surely bringing Kuwait to her kneBs and that Bin Saud knew this perfectly well. (c) That Bin Saud had no personal grudge against Kuwait, but believed, like himself (Fhilby) , that Kuwait had no right at all to exist as an independent State. (d) That as her population were all Nejdi^ by origin, they naturally were the subjects of Saudiyeh and would always be so considered by the King. (e) That the people of Kuwait one and an wanted Bin Saud to rule over them and not Ibn Subah. (f) That therefore it was ethically wrong that a single family like Ibn Subah should have it in their power to hold the best post in Arabia,and deny it to its rightful lord, just because His Majesty's Government chose to give support to that family - He for one thoughtHis Majesty's Government was putting themselves terribly in the wrong in this matter, and opined that if she withdrew her protection the people of Kuwait would of themselves ask Bin Saud to rule over them at once. (g) IRA^ claims to Kuwait were ridiculous and would not be tolerated at all by the King. 6. When I asked Philby what sort of men composed the Saudi Commission that was shortly to come to Kuwait, he replied that they were all eminently reasonable Nejdis, but could be counted to give nothing away.5 :- 7. ./hen I asked if he knew what sort of proposals they would put forward for settling the impasse with Kuwait, Philby replied 'It is not their business to put forward proposals it is up to Kuwait to do this- The King naturally wants the ?, Status quo', he wants no settleroent, his object is to starve Kuwait into submission,for it is only a question of time when this will happen - In Mubarak's time Kuwait Customs revenue was 15 lacs, today it is 1 lac# If in 23 years the Kuwait Customs has dropped from 13 to 1, I leave it to you, Dickson, to calculate when it will become nothing 11 . 3. i then asked whether he thought the King would agree to come to an agreaaent on the principle of customs posts and manifestPhilby said 'No certainly not'. This would involve Bin Saud in expense where now he has none - Why should he spend money to please Kuwait and His Majesty's Government. 9 To my c ^uery as to what he personally thought Bin Saud would agree to, he replied that as far as he knew Bin Saud might accept one of two things (a) A lumpsum down annually from the Shaikh of j.aiwalt (b) Some sort of transit duty system. but 'remexaber' he added 'we do not want a sett lenient'. 10. Throughout our talk Philby gave every indication that he had the King's ear, and was his close admirer and so spoke with authority: This though it may only have been bombast, may be significant. U. I of course am an old friend of Philby end no doubt this fact mae him speak possibly more openly, than he would have done elsewhere. 1 2. The MvermaiKs ar», I oonsld*. Interesting an highly important aa they hear ont «actly .hat the Shaikh4 : - Shaikli of Kuwait is never tired of saying day in and day out, namely that the work of the delegates is not only going to be a farce for the simple reason that they will have had previous instructions not to agree to any Custoias post and manifest system {the only thing acceptable to Kuwait), but that the real intention of Bin Saud is to manoeuvre Kuwait into a false position with His Majesty's Government. In other words Bin Saud will be able to say to His Majesty's G-overnment and to the people of Kuwait, if the conference fails, 'You see, I told you so, my delegates made several most reasonable offers, but brother Ahmad, stiff necked and unaccommodating as ever, will agree to nothing I propose, 1 leave His Majesty's Govern ment and Kuwait merchants to judge who is at fault therefor I or him. n 15^ In this way, as Shaikh Ahmad says, it is hoped by Bin Saud that he, Ahmad, will once again, be condemned by His Majesty's G-oveniment as the unreasonable villain of the piece and will more particularly lose popularity in the eyes of his own hard pressed people. i myself cannot but help (with my long local experience) being fully and entirely in agreement with all that the Shaikh says in this matter, for we must never forget that he is up against the 'big bad wolf' than whom nobody in Arabia is so cunning# the above remarks of Shaikh in mind, as the time draws near for the conference to be held. 15.

In paragraph 2 of that telegram you cite a letter from the Sheikh of Koweit to Ibn Saud dated the 28th August 1933, as containing mention of ''multiple' customs post, 3# We have not been able to trace any letter from the Sheikh to Ibn Saud bearing that date: but in Bushire despatch Ho, 44/757-3 of the 27th June 1933 was enclosed the draft (subsequently approved and despatched) of a reply from the Sheikh to Ibn Baud's proposal for the unification of Customs dues* This letter was assumed at the time to be the letter of the 7th August to which Ibn Saud replied on the 7th September see our despatch No. 304 of the 13th November 1933 — and we should not have hesitated to read 'August 7th H for your 'August 88th n if the Sheikh's draft letter, enclosed in the above-mentioned Bushire despatch, had not, by inference from the letter of the 14th February 1930 which it quotes, clearly referred to a 'single' and not 'multiple' customs posts. This is a very trivial point; but we should be grateful if you would help us to dispose of it. Yours ever, EASTERN DEPARTMENT. y x ' 4 I ' POtelOS OFFICE, S.W.I. q ^ ^ 31bt February, 1935, cepy, ^Ush Legation, Jedda,8.625 /226/26 British Legation, Jedda» 0th March 1935. My dear Ken, I reply personally to the Department's letter to my Chancery No. K 1155/206/85 of February Sist about the Kuwait blockade as I think I can explain most clearly in this way my difficulty about single and multiple customs posts. The Department are quite right about the reference in the body of my telegram Wo.51 of February 18th to the Sheykh's letter to Ibn 8aud. I should certainly have said the 'Sheykh's reply of August 7th.' That paper always confuses me as we have the text in one place and the date in another. Having just written '2Bth n f I wrote it again. Peccavi. Forgive me. The question of single versus multiple posts is now less important than it was when I sent isy telegram, as it is to be hoped that all the issuer will be threshed out at the proposed local conference. My difficulty, however, was this. At the Inter-Departmental meeting of April 28th 1933, Fowle apoke of a proposal 'that a number of Saudi customs posts should be set up outside Kuwait. 11 He described this as a proposal to which the Sheykh had agreed but which Ibn Baud had gone back on. He would therefore appear to have been thinking of the proposal of which Dickson gave a generally similar account in his report of June 22nd 1933, enclosed in Fowle * s despatch to the C.O. No. 4-4 of June «T'th, 1933. Dickson, however, defining the proposal with greater precision/ 10 tone, Esq, Office.precision, spoke of it as having reference to a single post. Now in hia letter to Ibn Saud of August 7th the Sheykh referred as you say to the old single-post proposal 'but he referred also in paragraph 16 to the possibility of a proposal 'by Ibn Baud to create ^a string of customs posts.* 1 He very clearly regarded this a distinct idea and, while he was quite polite about it, knowing that Ibn Saud could establish as many posts as he liked in his own territory, ha was by no means so precise as to the form his assistance would take in that alternative. Prima facie it might appear that it mattered nothing to the Sheykh whether merchants had to return through a single post or had a choice of several, I can well imagine nevertheless, that if he really wished to help to canalise trade, he might find it much easier to direct it to one point rather than to any of several. Hence the Question in my telegram. One cannot be too cautious in dealing with the two potentates concerned and in this case we have no first-hand knowledge of what passed between them in 1930.

Bated Sth April 1935 **Saudi-Kuwait Blockade Conference' Reference H # M # Minister Jeddah's telegi'am No. 77 dated 30th March 1955 (received 31st March). I eaclose translation of the following letters:- (a) Confidential letter No. C-35 dated 3.4.1935 from myself to H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait. (b) Confidential letter No. H-4/1994 dated 4.4.1935 from H # S. the Shaikh to myself. 2. For your information, after the Shaikh received my letter (a) above, he sent round his Secretary, K .B. Mulla Salih, the same evening to see me. The latter appeared upset and much worried at what he called his master f s 'difficult' attitude. The Shaikh be said had sent for him on receipt of my letter and had told him to go and tell me that he (the Shaikh) wanted to send his Kuwait delegates to Bahrain to meet the Saudi delegates there, as rC. according to him (the Shaikh)^would save time, trouble and expense. K.B. Mulla Salih said that he had expostulated with the Shaikh and told him that Bin Saud and His Majesty's G-ovemment would take such a suggsstion very unkindly indeed but that the Shaikh2 Shaikh, who had been seedy and very nervy of late, would not listen to him. Having delivered the message Mulla Salih advised me strongly to go to tackle his master the next day. This I did. 4. At my interview (on 4th April) the Shaikh came to the point at once and said he wanted to send the Kuwait delegates to Bahrain and not receive the Saudi delegates in Kuwait - I expressed very great surprise at his attitude and told him bluntly that I would be no party to the suggestion at all, and would refuse to telegraph such a foolish proposal to Jedda or to yourself - I then started a regular wordy fight with him, which resulted in his finally agreeing to write to me and say Jf# that he would receive the Commission at once, but that he desired that only the two senior members should come. ' The discussions ', he said, ' could be carried through better if few men talked '. Seeing that he was adamant, 1 agreed to wire Jedda the gist of the Shaikh's talk with me, (see my telegram No.88). The same evening the Shaikh sent me his letter (enclosed). 5. That the Shaikh is all nerves and unwell these days may be instanced by the fact that when I asked why he did not want all the Saudi delegates to cane (we believed them to be four) , he shouted out 'Why should I put up and feed them and their retainers - 1 have no money these days, I am on the verge of ruin, and all owing to your Government - put U P yourself rather heatedly that in the New Agenoy'. I replied^ I certainly would, if he wished to be stingy. He immediately changed his tone and replied rather pathetically 'forgive me my friend, but I am sick in heart and mind and the world seems wrong these days. I will . do my best, but I feel absolutely certain that Bin Saud has already told his delegates not to agree to the Customs posts r%y\ tq the onlv system I can possibly and manifest system, which is the onxy sy &amp; * I have already told your government agree to have, and whicn 1 j as muchas mucli by formal letter - Why then should I welcome men who are going to do nothing, nay, are going to try and bring about my ruin'. 5. The above is sent to give you an idea of how the wind is blowing here, but as I said in my telegram No. 90, I think, the real reason(apart from poor health), why the Shaikh is difficult, is because he is terrified of underhand methods being used against him by the delegates and in particular of a family intrigue being started through Shaikh Abdulla as Salim and Philby^ the news of whose coming arrival was conveyed to the Shaikh on 3rd April.

On receipt of telegram (3) above which incidently arrived with many mutilations - I sailed on the Shaikh at 4.30 P.M. on 9th April in his Gamp at BIYAN (situate some 7 miles from Kuwait). 3^i^h received me very cordially and after telling me that his wife the Lady Ahmad was getting on well after her recent unpleasant operation, he showed me a telegram which he had just received from Philby from Riath: This was to the effecteffect that he, Philby, would arrive about noon on 10th April, and was most anxious to see him, the Shaikh. 4. The Shaikh quite of 'his own bat' then volunteered the information that he believed that Philby was now working for the Standard Oil Company of California and that his visit to Kuwait was certainly, he thought, connected with oil and the Neutral Zone. He felt certain that Philby would try and 'but in' to the coming blockade conversations by orders of the King and that the latter 1 s intention was probably that Philby should deliver a confidential message something of this nature 'I ask you my brother Ahmad, to give your approval for your half interest of the Neutral Zone to be given to the Standard Oil of California, and I, Bin Saud ; will agree to a Blockade settlement on the lines of the customs posts and manifest system or possibly to it (the blockade) being ^abolished altogether. 5 # The Shaikh said that he would never agree at all to such proposal, if made and that so long as Bin Saud lived, he for one had no intention of signing away any rights of his in the Neutral Zone - (This he told me not to repeat). When I asked him why, he replied that Bin Saud was too dangerous a man to have any share in the Neutral Zone and he preferred, nay was certain, that the best policy for Kuwait was to 'Steralize' this particular Zone at any rate till the King died. 6. Expanding further, the Shaikh said that so detemined was he on this particular policy, that even x His Uajesty's Government told him to go ahead and give an oil concession in the Neutral Zone to an all British company, he would not agree, because it would give the King a definite e^d further stronger hold on Kuwait. (In this connection see a Hote on the possibility of dividing tte Ke.tr.l ^ in' I prepared5 I prepared for the India Ofrioe in September 1954). 7, I hprfe deemed it time to turn the conversation to the ooming Blockade conference and especially the point of my visit; So after some preliminary heart to heart observations^ to which the Shaikh reacted extremely well, I read out the gist of telegrams (2) and (3) referred to at the beginning of this Note - in other words I conveyed your message and that of His Majesty's Government. The Shaikh listened very attentively and then disarmed me somewhat by smilingly observing as follows.- 'I see that both Colonel Fowle and His Majesty's Government are justly angry with me for having suggested ghat Z delegates should come to Kuwait only. They need not be however, for I was just on the point of telling you myself today that I myself realised already that I had acted too quickly, and desired to withdraw my remarks to you of the 4th April and algo my letter of the same date (see enclosure). ,f He then went on to say that he desired me to telegraph to you at once and say that he had decided not only to receive the three Saudi delegates as soon as they were ready to come from Bahrain, but that ne would do every honour to them, anc^put them up in his own palace and for as long &amp;s thay liked. Further that all he had said on the 4th April had been born of panio at hearing that the redoubtable Philby was on his way to Kuwait to try conoiasion^ with him. 8. The Shaikh ended by asking me to be sure to make you and His Majesty's Government happy, on the score of the talks to be held with the Saudi dele@ates. These would be carried on .. sweetly as ioney this «.rd s ) he («.. Sbelkb) of C0ur . 0 listen to ell tte Seual repres .ntitlra. ied to sey end would weisn ell tteln pnopoeele In tn, Oelnnoe - Yet he felt bound to repe.t, edded the Sbeltb. tbet he »u=t the sake of6 saisie of the eventual salvation of his State and his people, concentrate on the Customs posts and manifest system and make that the major Issxq* 9 # The only possible alternative, he said, (and he had spent many months and years thinking over the matter) was for Bin Saud himself to give him a personal letter under his own seal and signature to the effect that he (Bin Saud) appointed him (Shaikh Ahmad) as his personal collector of all customs taxes on exports going out from Kuwait to Nejd, and that he (Bin Saud) would rely on his brother Ahmad's honour and word as a noble Arab, to ^pilay fair', and should there be good or poor customs returns, he (Bin Saud) would never complain or murmur. 10. I give the above curious suggestion from the Shaikh exactly as he gave it to me - There is a good deal to be said for it, I think, but I agree with the Shaikh that Bin Saud is hardly likely to agree to such a way of settling the trouble© 11 # One final and very interesting personal remark of the Shaikh is worth repeating. It was m eant for me only. He said 'In difficult and awakward matters to be solved between Arab States today and always, every effort of a European or a Christian Power, to get tton (the contesting parties) to arrived understanding, will fail, simply because Arab rulers in such affairs, believed they could manage their own affairs as between themselves as Muslims, much better than if ^ christies this ms « nothing to 4o with the tuestlon of the moral meturrn or « Pro too ting PO.» -hloh only oonoornod dotinitolr, llleg.1 hootllo .nd purely eggreeolve eote on the of the neighhonr with nhioh the State me at yarianoe.

Important t Your telegram No.1694 of 1st June asking me to / telegraph my views on Jedda telegram No.120 to Foreign Office. 1. Political Agent Kuwait wires that Shaikh is most upset at number of'delegates' party and while he will do his best he earnestly trusts that figure will be reduced through His Majesty's Government's efforts. On his visit to Riyadh (paragraph 2 of Jedda telegram) Shaikh took 40 men, but cases are not on all fours as Shaikh was invited by Ibn Saud for friendly visit while this is a business conference. v 2. Shaikh will not object to Qusaibi(paragraph 6 of Jedda telegram) although he regards him as prime instigator of blockade 3. Situation foreshadowed in my Express Letter of 24th April quoted by Ryan would now seemsjto have developed and Saudi Government by their obstructive attitude (inter alia raising their delegates' party to a preposterous number ^with drivers and servants it would be near 100) are in my opinion doing their best to torpedo conference or alternatively to penalise and humiliate Shaikh by imposing on /-2- ni _ imposing on. him the expenses of a 'counter demonstration' (para graph 4 of Jedda telegram). In the case of Bahrain conference total Saudi party came to about ten only. 4. Shaikh as will he seen is most reasonable but I do not think we should allow him to suffer the demonstration proposed by the Saudi Government. 5, There can in my opinion be no question oi Saudi guards entering Kuwait territory which is contrary to inter national practice. Saudi delegation can be accompanied up to Kuwait frontier by as many guards as Saudi Government think necessary. There these guards will be left behind and Shaikh's guards will escort delegation to Kuwait. I venture to suggest that this be put to Saudi Government with the addition that nis Majesty's Government consider that a total of twenty-five including drivers and servants is ample for the delegates' party. That if this proposal is not accepted His Majesty's Government will be compelled to assume that the Saudi Government do notjvflsh the conference to take place* -Resident.Telegram R» From H.M.'s Minister, Jedda.

No»137i Dated and received the 3rd June 1935. Your telegram No.78. I received June 1st lengthy reply to protest. Following is very condensed summary. Saudi Government have held enquiry and are still pursuing it as they do not wish any incident to disturb their relations with His Majesty^ Government and Shaikh, wlim is King's intimate friend. In view of facts ascertained they chiefly regret that this simple incident should he represented as armed incursion intended to violate Shaikh's sovereignty. Movement 'between the two countries of subjects and messengers carrying arms is an everyday occurrence. Persons now in question were four not six. -Fhey belonged to a party of his retainers whom Governor of Hasa had deputed to assemble tribesmen at certain spot and to collect zikat. Shammar had been summoned to IJ.'rutaii watering places but on arrival party found that they were still in Kuwait territory. -Commander therefore sent messengers to Kuwait to telegraph to Governor for instructions. Natural route was via SUBAHIYA and JAHRA. Messengers may have informed tribesmen whom they met on the way where zikat was being collected so that they might make haste to pay and escape liability for subsequent punishment. Having picked/picked up a car three messengers went on to Kuwait to telegraph whereupon they were ordered out of Kuwait territory. Note develops further thesis that crossing of frontier in both directions by armed parties without permission is normal e*g. Shaikh ! s messengers go to Riyadh and Hasa and members of Shaikh's family visit Saudi Arabia accompanied by his troops to hunt. If Government of Kuwait object to visits o± Sa^di subjects and. messengers Saudi Government must apply reciprocal treatment though they consider it contrary to prevailing friendship and to efforts they are making to promote economic relations. In view of treatment accorded to his messengers Governor of Hasa has been instructed to prevent all entry into Kuwait. Saudi Government request that pending an agreement Kuwait authorities should prohibit officials and others from entering Saudi territory for any purpose without •orevious permission as explosion of messengers has caused perturbation amongst tribes and has been regarded as hostile action at a time when Saudi Government are straining every nerve to establish close and friendly relations. -RYAN' •53/54 !

He probably 7^U Governor of Hasa was guilty of indiscretion but takes offensive as best means of defence. 2. Any rejoinder mut. depends somewhat on your reaction to my telegram No .120 and observations of authorities at Kuwait on argument that normal crossing of frontier includes passage of parties mut. Shaikh^ troops. Subject to these factors I suggest that I should reply on the following ? general lines before I leave June 7th. 3, His Majesty's Government are glad to infer that messengers did not belong to King's organised forces but were merely retainers of the Governor of Hasa. It is nevertheless clear that they belonged to party sent by him in the first place to collect zikat. If they simply intended to go to Kuwait for the purpose indicated they exposed themselves to grave misunderstanding by staying two days at Subahiya and diverging from the usual route to visit Jahra. It could only be inferred from these mut. and from the language mut^_ by them to tribes that their mission was to _mut. pressure on them while still in Kuwait territory to return to Saudi Arabia and pay zikat. His Majesty's Government hope that steps /steps will be taken to prevent recurrence of such action which presents at least appearance of attempt to exercise of authority in King r s name outside his territory. For the rest neither they nor the Shaikh wish to interfere with any existing practice as regards crossing of frontier for legitimate purposes. On the contrary they welcome the assurance of the Saudi Government for this desire to promote restoration of economic relations which have long been interrupted. It was because they shared this desire that they did not on their side in any way connect incident of Hay 6th with arrangements for proposed conference# - MINISTER53/54 Telegram xx From To Political Resident, H»M.S»Bideford, at Doha.

I venture to suggest that it might be added that had Saudi party borne letters from 3iudi authorities addressed to Shaikh and had gone direct to Shaikh, or even without letters had taken this course, Shaijh would doubtless have assisted them to carry out their mission♦ 2. Political Agent Kuwait can doubtless report whether armed parties of the Shaikh as alleged by Saudi Government enter Saudi territory on shaikh's business without letters addressed to the Saudi authorities, or alternatively without instructions to refer to Saudi authorities before taking any action. - Resident■63/54 Telegram xx From Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London.

Use of expression 'guards' may have created unduly ? misleading impression. As I understand it men in question would be armed retainers whose attendance is regarded in Arabia as essential to dignity ol important persons wherever they go and whatever purpose of journey. 3, I had already informed Saudi Government on the strength of Kuwait telegram ^0.158 to me that Shaikh would not object to moderate number of guards. This precludes line suggested in first part of paragraph 5 of telegram under reference. In any case European conceptions of internation al practice are so alien to Kejd that it would be impossible to negotiate on that basis. It would moreover be undesir able in my opinion to haggle over particular burnt ers especially as I have no longer any means oi discussing matter orally and amicably with any responsible authority.-2- qji I atill regard nxunber of attendants as excessive but Kuwait differs from mut. mut« in the fact that Shaikh himself surrounds himself with large numbers of armed men. 6. My appreciation of Ibn Saud's attitude is that he will stick to his 'counter demonstration r, till all is blue but will be able all the more inclined to make a show of reasonableness at the conference. This opinion is confirmed by note summarised in my telegram No .121. The conference may fail in any case but if you also attach importance to it as a stage in our efforts to settle the blockade question I n©w consider that best course would be to reply to that note on the lines suggested in my telegram No. 122 and inform Saudi Government simultaneously that while number of attend ants whom they propose sending with delegates is much greater than Shaikh and His Majesty's Government had expected they will raise no objection to their entry into Kuwait. 6.

Dated 21st May igg 5 'Saudi Armed Party in Kuvmit ft &gt; Reference correspondence ending witli my telegram No. 148 dated ISth May. E. I have to report that on the 19th May I received a letter from Al Nafisi, Bin Saud's Trade Agent here, to the effect that he had received a telegram frcm the King giving the foil owing curious version of the 'Armed Party' incident namely 'That he, the King had heard it from His Majesty's in Minister aofc Jedda, that one Haif abu Shijara with a party of camel riders had attacked the Kumit tribes end that the latter had captured Haif himself and had then released him.' A1 Hafisi endeQ i asking me to let him have in writing details of the incident as far as I knew them (although of course he is fully aware of them himself, having come and discussed the whole business at the time with me.) 3. Believing it to be in the highest degree unlikely that His Majesty's Minister could ever have conveyed such a distorted version of 1iie story to the King, and thinking there might beV f ^JuuldjtA. might be some trick underlying A1 Nafisi's letter that the best thing I could do was to ?/rite privately to A1 Nafisi, and furnish Mm with 1iie gist of my telegram No. 134 of 9th May 1935 and in general give him my version of the affair. 4 # I accordingly replied under a personal and confiden tial note, English translation of which I send you with this together with translation of A1 Nafisi's letter to me. 5, A1 Nafisi of course has no official status in Kuwait but as he is an old friend and supporter of this Agency, I deemed it right to let him have a reply to his letter.

In reply I beg to say that it is clear that some misunderstanding has no?; taken place. 3. This indeed is what I feared would happen from the arrival of Hayif Abu Shajara without letters from 'Abdulla ibn Jaloui to His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad, and from Abu Shajara r s action in visiting the Shammar Shaikhs direct and his ordering them as well as the Dhafir under ♦Ajemi Al Suwait to leave Kuwait territory immediately and go to Hafar al~Batin, all of which he did wiihout any reference to Shaikh Ahmad the Ruler of Kuwait in whose territory the ^hammar and Dhafir were camped, and who were indeed in the position of guests of the Al Sabah. 4# In order that you may know what the true facts are I embody herewith the gist of the information which I telegraphed to Colonel Fowle, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf:- 'Shaikh reports that a small Sa'udi armed aprty numbering six from Hoffuf under command of Hayif Abu Shajara, and acting under orders of ibn Jaloui crossed frontier/~ 2 ~ frontier on 6tli May and visited Shammar and Dliafir camped at ^ubaihiyeh and Jahrali, and in higli-lianded manner ordered, them immediately to wi thdraw from Kuwait territory.
