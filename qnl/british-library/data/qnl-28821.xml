INDIA OFFICE Similar letter sent toBritish Legation, Ho. 76. j Tehran. 4 MAR 18th February, 1^35. 1 093 Sir, The With reference to your despatch No. 1 (E 6967/646/34) of January 1st last, on the subject of the Cable Station at Jask, I have the honour to report that the Oriental secretary to His Majesty’s Legation has been informed verbally by the Head of the F)ngli 8 h Section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that he has now received the report of the comraission set up to examine this question on the spot. The commission apparently met at the end of December, but I only learned of this after the event. 2. According to Ali Khan Motaraedy the commission, which consisted of the local Governor and two other officials, has recommended that a new boundary line, which is apparently the same as that suggested by the Company (vide paragraph 11 of Sir K.H. hoare’a despatch No. 191 of April 16th, 1934) should be laid down as the limits of the Cable station. Motamedy went on to say that the principle cm which the commission had based itself was that of consideration of the actual current needs of the station and he repeated his previous view that it was inadmissible to regard the area of the station aa that laid down in former Telegraph Agreements. He added that there were two points which remained for settlement. The first of these concerned the construction of a proper fence of barbed wire or other suitable material round the new boundary, in order to safeguard the water supply from encroachment and pollution. Mr. Bottomley, who represented the Company during the discussions at JasJt, had /insisted kight Honourable Sir John &amp;lmon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign office. etc. ,- 2 - insisted that this was a necessity hut the Persian commissioners did not agree to this and took the view that the local Governor, who was responsible for local arrangements, would take the necessary steps to safeguard the water supply and everything else. 3. The second point concerned the building marked as No. 10 in the plan. The Persian commissioners argued that this was not necessary for the cable station since it had been t et to the K.L.M. IXitch Airways and had been used by them for ome time as a rest house. 4. The above findings of the commission, as stated by Motamedy, are substantially in agreement with the account of the discussions given in the telegrams exchanged between Ur. Bottomley and the Manager, Persian Gulf, Karachi, copies of which have been forwarded to me by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire. It is evident from these that the Company are determined to insist on the construction of an adequate wall or fence, and also that they are extremely unwilling to surrendex their rights to building No. 10, since they would have need of it once more if all the members of their staff were married men with families. 5. In reply to an enquiry By Mr. Trott as to whether the Ministry for Foreign Affairs would support the report of the commission, Motaraedy replied in the affirmative and gave the impression that the report would soon be communicated to His Majesty’s Legation. 6 . Vlth regard to the concluding paragraph of your despatch under reference, I have made enquiries of the Company's legal adviser as to whether the Persian Government have been notified of the change in their title, and will inform you of the result in due course. No notification of the change. /however,however, would ever appear to have been communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs by iiis Majesty’s Legation.

To this note I have never received a reply, hut the Head of the Kngliah seetion of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs recently adverted to the matter in the course of a conversation which he had with tho oriental reoretary. To a oertein eactont he was prepared to admit that the contentions advanced in ay not# were oorreet, Out the Persian Government could certainly not agree that the area of the station as fixed in 188T was that to which tho Imperial and International Comnurii cat ions Company were entitled to-day. All tho old Telegraph Agreements had lapsed and any provisions which they contained regarding the st&amp;tiii at J&amp;sk were no longer valid. 5. On the other hand the Persian Government realised that a station &lt;m»t exist at J&amp;sk and that it ust provide for all the reasonable wants of the Company f s staff. The only question to be decided was therefore the sise of the area necessary for this purposo and whether it should inolude, for instanoe, a cemetery, baths and a tennis-court. This could only The Right Honour able Sir John Simon &amp;.G.3.I., etc., etc., efco., The Foreign Office.- 2 - only be deeloed after an examination held on tho spot and ai % r a a^e mo at e had therefore been made to form a ooMlesion to visit the station* It would consist of tho now Governor, Sa f d us Sultan, who would be the representative of the Mule try of the Interior, and representatives of the } 4 lnistries of j?oats and felearaubo suid Finanoe. fhe Coramloolon, which would aeet at an early date, would invite the cooperation of the ooixp&amp;ny’s local representative* A aele to the nbove offset would be addressed to me* 4* In reply Hr* frott ar^jued that the area to ihleh the Company was entitled oould be none other than that laid down in 18B7, but All Khan rutamedi remained unshaken* &amp;• vhile i have not yet received the promised note from the Persian Oovernme t, I have considered it wise to cauae the Company 1 s representative at Jask to be warned of the position, and I have the honour to transmit herewith a eopy of a telegram which I have addressed to His Male sty's Consul-General at Bushire in the matter* Examination of the files would appear to show that the area of the stations to be triten over by the Imperial and International Communications Company was never discussed during the negotiations for the Agreement of February 17th, IV^g, end that the matter is governed by article 4(1) of the Agreement* X argued this view in some detail in my note of April ICtli last, but us the F^rsian Government are now apparently dis osed to reject it, I should be grateful if the legal asp-^ets of the matter could be exaoined in your Department X propose to inform you by telegraph as soon as I receive the awaited note from the Persian Government and I shall be grateful if I may then be furnished with ins true t ions as to what attitude should *• adopted ia tha #T*nt of reaching oonoluaioa* lni*i*«l to th*to th« later eats of the imperial aad International Couimu/ ic- atlona company.

X have delayed sending in the note in the hope tnat s regular head of the festem European Section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs might be appointed with who* it would ho possible to havo a prelialnar. discussion, but as such an appointment seems to be indefinitely postponed, X have decided to send in the note without further delay. 8. The suggestion about the payment for the wall being made from tariff charges due to the Persian Postal Administration has been made in order to provide the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with an saeler method of securing payment than embarking on the almost hopeless task of extracting ready money from the Persian Treasury or military authorities. X have, however, but little idea of the amount of the sums paid periodically to tha Persian Government on account of messages originating from The Honourable The Political Kesldsnt in tha Persian Gulf, /Persia BUd&amp;IRK.and passing through ths four atatlons and I should ba glad of any information on this point 9 aa wall as on tha aatlnatad cost of araeting tha neoaaaary wall* or alternativsly a fence. 3* Tha map which 1 haws aant to tha ITlniatry for Foralga Affairs ia idantioal with that accompanying your despatch* except that I have altered oartain phraaaa* for axampla* ,# aatiira ,# has baan deleted from 'native village', 'Boundary of British concession'* beoomaa 'Boundary of Telegraphs rroperty', 'O.C^ Quarters' becomes 'Bungalow', 'Barracks' near Bo.

An agreement to determine the limits of the I.E.T.D. Stations at Jask was concluded with the Persian Government in 1887* A copy of that agreement (the genesis of which is explained in the I.E.T.D. papers flagged) will be found at serial XXIII page 28 of the^ printed collection. This agreement specified the exact limits of the station and provided that the Government of Jask should have ’’no right whatever on any account whatever to interfere in the interior of those limits”. As the telegraph establishment well was about 1000 yards distant from the boundary agreed upon it was further decided that ”the road and waterway from the well to the place where they raest the limits be protected and no-one shall build upon, destroy or interfere with them; and for the preservation of the well itself it is agreed to set aside a space around the well to be walled in at a distance of 100 yards from the well”. It was further agreed that *the customs and other buildings of the prooon% Government generally must be without the limits above agreed upon”. 5y mutual consent the limits laid down in 1887 were slightly modified in 1888, but since then the position appears to have remained unchanged. The land in question has neither been purchasednor leased nor any renf^paid for it. On the closing down of the I.E.T.D. on 1st March, 1S31, the Telegraph Stations at Jask Bushire, Oharbar, Henjam were handed over to the Communications Company as part of the transferred/Minute Paper Department &lt; \ A transferred assets of the Department and under Article 4 (1) of the Anglo-Persian Telegraph Agreement 1932, the Persian Government have given permission to the Company as Agent of H.M.G. and i the Government of India to maintain and work until 1945 the Cable Offices at those places. On the other hand the agreement, vide article 6 , nullifies all previous agreements with Persia relating to telegraph questions, from which it would seem that when that agreement is ratified we shall no longer be in a position to claim for the Communications Company that immunity from encroachment which the Department enjoyed by virtue of the Jask Agreement of 1887; and from the correspondence now forwarded by the Company it looks as if the Persians are already anticipating the changed position which will then be brought about by removing the boundary posts and erecting buildings inside the limit of the concession. On the face of it there will be nothing to prevent encroachments of this kind in future unless we can obtain for the Company the same security of tenure as the Department had and which they were undoubtedly entitled to expect when they took over the station, but for which no provision has been made in the Agreement with Persia. &lt; ?,i. c c ^ In August 1931 the Company raised the question X with the Political Department whether provision was being made in the Agreement with Persia as to the leases (if any) existing in regard to the Cable stations which had been taken over by them as they desired to feel assured that their liability for rentals was fixed. They were informed that, so far as the records here showed, the only station where the buildings were held tl5n :{0(l0 10 31 on lease by the Department was Bushire, that those at Henjam/' 1 ... ■■I Henjam, Jask and Charbar belonged to the „ x Department, and that it was not proposed to make ^ any reference in the agreement to the leases, etc. c l ue 8 ^i on * Presumably the question of the site (as distinct from the buildings) and any adjacent land was not considered. The position at Bushire calls for no comment, as the buildings are leased from a private individual. &lt; The lease, which was originally granted in 1906 and has been renewed from time to time, expires in 1933, but it can probably be again renewed without difficulty. Henjam . In 1868 a concession was obtained from Persia for the erection of a telegraph statioji on the island. The station was open until 1880, when it was closed, but reopened in 1904. Shortly after its reopening a dispute arose with the Persian Government, in consequence of the erection of Persian buildings in the neighbourhood of the station, as to the limits of the station. The Persians maintained that as the concession did not mention land, no land was conceded; but in this Office letter P. 3701/05 of 3rd January 1906 to the Foreign Ofiice the Secretary of State took the view that w the acquiescence of the Persian Government in the actual facts of the occupation may be regarded as equivalent to a formal concession of the land occupied' and K.M.G. informed the Persian Government accordingly. The Persians did not admit this, but were prevente by further British representations from taking any steps to assert their own claims; the limits a \i^ H //fOS /3t / zMinute Paper. Department. of the station were never defined and the subject was dropped. So far as this Department is aware it has never been reopened. Qharbar . The buildings were erected in 1869, but there does not appear to be at this office any record of any special concession there. When the buildings were erected the territory belonged to the Sultan of Muscat, but later on the Mekran boundaries were moved and Charbar became part of Persian territory. So far as is known there has been no interference with the station and therefore the question of the limits of the telegraph concession has not arisen. It will appear from the foregoing that the limits of the Cable stations at Henjam and Charbar which have been taken over by the Communications Company are neither defined nor secure from encroachment^and that those at Jask,although hitherto defined, are no longer safeguarded. Possibly political considerations make it inexpedient that we should raise the cases of the two former stations with the Persian Government unless and until forced to do so, but there seems no reason why we should not endeavour to secure for the Company at Jask the same immunity from encroachment as was enjoyed by the I.E.TJ). under the Agreement of With that end in view it is suggested that the Foreign Office might be addressed on the lines of the 1887 :}5A 3000 5 31Draft Paper Department r\ —' The Under secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward herewith &gt; for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter which has been received from Imperial and International Communications Ltd., relating to the removal by the local Persian authorities of the boundary posts^and the erection tafefe of buildings inside the boundary,^* the telegraph the Indo-European Telegraph Department and transferred to the Company as from 1st March 1931 on the closing down of that Department • As suggested by the Company, the occupation of the land in question by the Indo-European Telegraph Department was by virtue of the Agreement between Great Britain and Persia regarding the limits of the Persian telegraph station at Jask which was concluded in 1887, a copy of which is attached for convenience of reference. In this agreement the boundaries of the telegraph establishment were defined in detail and it was agreed that M the Government of Jask shall have/ 1000 5.32. have no right whatsoever on any o ooLun on whatever to interfere in the interior of those limits* w It was further agreed that M the customs and other buildings of the Persian Government Agent must he without the limits above agreed upon*' As stated above, the station was handed over to the Company on 1st March 1931 and under the agreement recently signed on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and India, and the Persian Government^in regard to the withdrawal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department from Persia, the Persian Government have undertaken to permit an Agent (i*e* l£i*. Company) appointed by the Govern ment of the United Kingdom and the Government of India to maintain and work the Submarine Cable Offices atBushire, Henjam, Jask and Charbar until 1st March 1945. There is, however, nothing in this agreement extending to the Compan^immunity from interference and encroachment at Jask which was ensured to the Indo-European Telegraph Department by the Jask agreement of 1887. Moreover, wk Article 6 of the agreement wkaml* provides that the agreement replacea all existing agreements/ ODraft Paper, Department &lt;)04 4000 5.32 agreements between the contracting parties relating to telegraph questions except the International Telegraph Conventions. Consequently on the ratification of this agreement the Jask agreement will automatically lapse and therefore it will no longer be possible to claim such immunity by right. As regards the position at the three other Cable Stations referred to c above, I am to explain that that at Bushire calls for no comment since the buildings are leased from a private individual. At Hen jam the buildings were erected as a result of a concession obtained from the Persian Government in 1868. The station was open till 1880 when it was closed, but reopened in 1904. Shortly after its reopening a dispute arose with the Persian Government as to the limits of the * otatiefi. The Persians maintained that as the concession did not mention land, no land was conceded: but in this Office letter P.3701/05 of 3rd January 1906 to your Department the Secretary of State for India took the view that M the acquiescence of the Persian Government in the actual facts of the occupation may be regarded as equivalent to a formal concession of the land occupied ,* 1 and His Majesty’s Government/GoverrauenVinformed the Persian Government accordingly. The Persians did not admit this, but were prevented by further British representations from taking any steps to assert their own claims. The limits of the station were never defined and the subject was dropped. So far as this Department is aware it has never been reopened. Charbar . As regards Charbar^ the buildings were erected in 1869 but so far as the Secretary of State for India is aware, no special concession was granted there. When the buildings were erected the territory belonged to the Sultan of Muscat, but later on the Mekran boundaries were moved and Charbar became part of Persian territory. So far as is known there has been no interference with the station and kZl therefore aM. question of the limits of the telegraph concession has not arisen. Prom the foregoing it will be seen that the limits of the Cable stations at Henjam and Charbar which &lt; * have been taken over by the Communications Company are neither defined nor secure from encroachment^ while those at Jask, although hitherto defined, are no longer saf eguarded. The Secretary of State for India is of opinion that for political/Draft Paper.

AVE LONDON.” CHi/M. ^ t- COMMUNICATIONS J BE ADDNESSEO TO THE GENERAL MANAGER AND SECRETARY the reference and date of THIS LETTER BEINO QUOTED Sir, I beg to enclose herewith a copy of a telegram addressed by this Coinpai^y's Manager at Karachi to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and a copy of the Political Resident’s communication of the 10th May 1932 to H.B.M’s Minister at Teheran, both relating to the question of the land and buildings at Jask formerly occupied by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, from which latter it would appear that occupation of the land in question by the Indo-European Telegraph Department was by virtue of an Agreement made in 1877, the details of which are, of course, not known to this Company, and it is suggested that such Agreement is cancelled by Article 6 (i) of the Persian Telegraph Agreement dated the 17th lebruary 1932. As the Secretary of State for India is aware the land and buildings comprising the Jask Station have passed into the possession of this Conpany under the Memorandum of Conditions accompanying his letter of the 28th August 1930, and the Coupany has hitherto assumed that in accordance with the intention of that Memoranduo, there would be transferred to it the benefit of any lease, agreement or evidence of title relating thereto. The Under Secretary of State, INDIA OFFICE, Whitehall, S.W.L- 2 - 1932. 28th June, If, however, the present position is as set out in the Political Resident's letter above referred to, it would seem that as a result of the conclusion of the Agreement of 17th February last the Company is deprived, of security of tenure of the land at Jask, a view which is apparently shared by the local Persian autnorities as evidenced by the removal of the boundary posts and erection of buildings inside the boundary. In view of the above, I an instructed to request that the Secretary of State for India will be good enough to infonn the Company as to its position in regard to the occupation of the property it has taken over at Jask, and take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that the Company receives the same security of tenure of such property as, and on terms not more onerous than accorded to the Indo-European Telegraph Department there.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith for your information a copy of a telegram received from the Manager, Persian iktt Gulf A Section, of the Irroerial and International C on- mn cations Ltd:. Presumably Article 6(1) of the Telefraph Agreement of 17th Feby: 1952 cancels the Jask Agreement of 1877* ^f this assumption is correct then it is not clear on what basis the Imperial and International Communications Company hold the ground on which their offices and ouarters at Jask are built. It is obviously undesirable on sanitary grounds that anyone #10 likes should be entitled to come into the area formerly ceded to the lndc- r ’.uropean Telegraph . Department and build in close oroximity to the Telegraph On s. The Innerial ami Airways rest house is also with’n the Telegranh Concession and it is enually undesirable that the exceedingly primitive inhabitants of Jask. should be allowed to sot up buildings huts, etc: close to it. 2 # It ?fould therefore seem essential that the Company should obtain from the Persian Government a lease of such area as my be necessary for their repuirements and for the provision of ordinary amenities for their employ&lt;£». I have not yet sent any reply to the Manager, Persian Gulf Section, but if you concur with the views expressed above, I would suggest that he should be advised to recomned to his Principals to apply for a lease from the Persian Government of the old concession area.

Whereas under date 25th Rajub 1269 (4th M ay 1853) we, Chief of the Toasniees, Chief of the Beniyas, Chief of Ununool Keiweyn, Chief of Liman, Chief of Debay, did agree to a perpetual Treaty of Peace at sea, and whereby our vessels have been respected and our commerce increased ; and whereas the British Government, in the further interests of commerce and of the general peace, are preparing telegraphic lines and stations at various points in or near the Persian Gulf, we do hereby engage for ourselves, our heirs and successors, to respect and abstain from all and every inter ference with the said telegraphic operations that may be carried on by the said British Government in or near our territory. And in the event (which God forbid) of any of our subjects or dependents committing an act of aggression or tres])ass on the said telegraphic lines and stations or other telegraphic material, we will immediately punish the offender and proceed to afford full redress upon the same being brought to our notice.

II. Translation of an Agreement with the Jam of Beila, dated the 21st December 1861 Whereas it is in contemplation to carry on as far as India the communication now opened between Great Britain and other high States of Europe and Asia by continuing the Line of Electric Telegraph from Constantinople and Bagdad through Persia and Baluchistan to Karachi, and whereas, in the prosecution of this scheme of universal benefit, it has become necessary to take measures for the security and protection of the said contemplated line, the high Government of Bombay have deputed Major E. J. Goldsmid, for the special purpose of entering into such negotiations with the several Chiefs holding territory between Karachi and Guadur, as may be deemed necessary for the due furtherance of the aforesaid undertaking. Now the line of coast from the Hubb River to Khos Kulmut or its vicinity, a distance of 240 measured miles, being within the Territory of Jam Meer Khan, Chief of Lus Beyla, the undersigned, Major E. J. Goldsmid, on the part of the British Government and with the knowledge and consent of its firm ally, Khodadad Khan, Ruler of the Sovereign State of Khelat, hereby makes agreement with dam Meer Khan aforesaid, for the construction, maintenance and protection of the Line of Telegraph between the above-mentioned places. The detailed agreement is as follows : — I. The materials for the line may be landed on any part of the coast between the Hubb River and Khos Kulmut, and all reasonable assistance will be rendered by the local authorities in ensuring its security and facilitating its construction, due payment being made for labour or articles supplied. II. There will be two telegraph stations erected for the residence and office of Signallers, one at Sonmeanee and one at Ormara. III. All individuals authoritatively employed in the construction, maintenance or use of the line aforesaid shall receive such protection and assistance from the local authorities as will enable them to prosecute their work without let or hindrance, due payment to be made for labour or articles supplied. IV. A sum of rupees 10,0()0' ::: ' yearly shall be paid by the Political Agent at Khelat to the Jam of Beyla, on the understanding that he keeps up an establishment * The amount of yearly payment must depend on further reference as to the actual work required. Hut the undersigned is of opinion that tin* full sum may he double that fixed for the pay of a watching establishment here entered. For instance, supposing such establishment to he Rs. 830 per mensem, the yearly amount would be Ks. 3,960, of which the double would he Hs. 7,920. This would be estimated in round nu mbers at Rs. 8,000. A 2\ T of not less than men, on salaries ot rupees per mensem in the aggregate, tor the due protection of the line, and rendering such assistance as from time to time may be required by the telegraph employes stationed on the coast. \ . Should it be authoritatively reported at any time that the said establishment is insullicient, and such injury be done to the Line as would lead to the belief that due care was not exercised in its protection, the Political Agent, Khelat, will be empowered to call upon the dam of Beyla to make such additional payment as will not exceed in the whole the amount of full yearly subsidy. VI. The annual payment to the Jam will commence Irom the date that live miles ol Telegraph wire may be reported set up, all intermediate payment being made according to labour or articles supplied, as previously provided. \ 11 . Complaints against individuals in the employ of the Telegraph Department not capable of satisfactory adjustment, will be referred to the Political Agent at Khelat; any cases of urgency, whether in the nature of a complaint or otherwise affecting such persons may be referred to the Magistrate or Commandant of Police at Karachi as exceptional, should occasion require. VIII. Continued obstruction or injury to the Line may cause revocation of this agreement on the part of Government at any time. The agreement made between the parties hereto, as above defined, is to be considered dependent, for completion and effect, upon the approval of the Bombay Government. Soxmeanee; (Sd.) L. d.

Engagement Telegraph V. between Great Britain and Turkey for the Extension of Line from Baghdad to Bessora and to Khanakain (1863). Protocol. A Consequent upon the exchange of notes which has taken place between the Embassy of Her Britannic Majesty and the Ministry of Foreign A Hairs of llis Majesty the Sultan on the subject of the extension of the line above ground from Baghdad to Ihissora and to Khanakain, with the object of connecting by two different lines the Indian Telegraphs with the telegraphic network of Europe, the Ambassador of Her Britannic Majesty at the Sublime Porte and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Sultan, with a view to this, have decided on the following arrangement:— Article I.—The Ottoman Government will extend at its own expense— ( 1 ) The line above ground from Baghdad to Bussora. ( 2 ) It will construct a line above ground from Baghdad to Khanakain on the Persian Frontier. These two lines shall consist of two wires, of which the one shall be kept exclusively for direct messages. 2. 'The Indian Government, on its side, at its own cost, shall carry the Indian submarine cable, which joins at Bushire, either to Bussora or to some other point at■■■■■■■■■ I mm I G the month of the Slmt-el-Arab, which shall be designated later, and which shall be connected with the line above ground. The Indian Government besides shall furnish to the Ottoman Government all the necessary materials, including the poles of iron, for the construction of the two lines above ground before mentioned. ^ The two Telegraphic Engineers who are already at Baghdad, as also the ^ Inspector and the four sub-officers of the British Engineers who are soon expected to arrive in that city, shall be placed at the disposal of the Ottoman authorities to co-operate in the construction of these lines. 4. The Ottoman Government shall pay for the materials thus furnished by the Indian Government with the money received for telegraphic messages from India, which shall traverse the line.' of the extreme European frontier of the Ottoman Empire, be it to Bussora or as far as Khanakain, according to a special arrangement which the two Governments reserve to themselves to establish, to determine the mode and the period of the payment of the price of these materials. The salaries of the Engineers to be paid by the Indian Government. The materials which shall be furnished b}’ - the Indian Government shall be consigned on their arrival to the hands of the Ottoman authorities, and a receipt given for them. 5. The Imperial authorities shall immediately receive orders to begin the work upon the line from Baghdad to Bussora. G. The submarine cable which is to meet the line above ground from Baghdad to Bussora shall be laid as soon as possible, in order to secure simultaneous operations. 7. As soon as this line shall have been completed, the Ottoman Government shall commence the line from Baghdad to Khanakain for which the Indian Government equally engages to furnish materials and Engineers on the same conditions as those which have been stipulated for the line from Bussora. 8 . The Sublime Forte shall take care, if need be, to employ, for the working of these lines, persons acquainted Avilh the English language. 9. ;;: 'A11 the despatches addressed to or coming from India shall be equally divided between the line from Baghdad to Bussora on the one hand, and that of Khanakain on the other. To avoid all difficulty of execution, the application of this system of division shall be as follows :— All despatches coming from India shall pass by the line from Khanakain. On the other hand, all those for India shall be sent by the line from Baghdad to Bussora. 10. The stipulation of Article 9 shall remain in force for ton years, at the end of which it can be revised by means of a new understanding between the two Governments. 11 . The two Governments reserve to themselves the right to determine on and conclude a Telegraphic Convention on the basis of the Act of Brussels, which constitutes the International Law of lines of Electric Telegraphs. In faith of which the Ambassador of Her Britannic Majesty and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan have signed the present protocol in duplicate and have annexed their seals.

Signed in the English and l r reach Languages at Constantinople, ord September 1804.| Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and His Majesty the Emperor of the Ottomans, being desirous to establish between * * On 9th December 1863, an additional article was added to tbe protocol, stipulating that instead of dividing the ti-aftic equally between the Bussora and Khanakain lines, messages should be forwarded indifferently by either line, and that payment should be calculated on the mean between 375 and 89 miles, the distances between Baghdad and Bussora, and Baghdad and Khanakain respectively, so long as both lines are kept in efficient working order. + Ratitications exchanged at Constantinople. 31st October 1864. t8 VII. The Ottoman Government will take the necessary measures to secure that one wire of the main line from Constantinople to Kao shall bo always exclusively devoted to Indo-European messages. In case this wire should get out of order, or in case of a press of traffic, the official Indo-European messages may be forwarded by one of the wires intended for local traffic, but, alter the official despatches of the Ottoman Government. In that case private Indo-European despatches shall be forwarded, together with private messages already deposited at the office, and in alternative order with those messages, whatever may have been the hour at which the latter may have been deposited. VIH. The Convention of Brussels, of 30th dune 1808 , in all that, relates to the details of the telegraphic service shall be mutually observed by the two contracting Governments, in so far as it is not opposed to the terms of the present Convention. IX. It is agreed between the High Contracting Parties that the rates for Indo- European messages sent by the Ottoman lines in Asia throughout their whole extent from Constantinople to Fao, or to the Persian frontier in the direction of Khanakain and vice verso, shall not exceed the limit of 27.V francs for a single message sent from Constantinople to Kao or vice versa, and of 22f francs for a single message sent from Constantinople to Khanakain or vice versa, as also that the rates for messages traversing the whole submarine line from India to Kao, or to Bushire and vice versa, shall not exceed the limit for the former of G2A francs for each single despatch and for the latter of 50 francs. X. The administrations of the two contracting Governments will communicate to each other with the least possible delay the tariff of their stations and frontiers, in so far as they may have reference to the Indo-Ottoman frontier of Fao. According to that tariff the rates shall be mutually accounted for in the monthly accounts of messages exchanged between the two administrations at the aforesaid frontier of Kao. XI. The mutual account for telegraphic rates, expenses of postage, and of expenses, &amp;c., shall be checked at the expiration of every month and settled quarterly. The liquidation and payment of the surplus which may be due to either administration shall take place at the close of each quarter. The accounts of each administration shall enumerate only the rates in debit; they shall be drawn up by the Ottoman Administration in francs and centimes, the total being reduced to shillings and pence ; and by the British Administration in shillings and pence, the total being reduced to francs and centimes. The reduction of these sums shall be calculated at the rate of— 1 Pound sterling ~ 25 francs. 1 Shilling -- 1 franc 25 centimes. 1 Penny =10 centimes. XII. The balance which may accrue from the quarterly liquidation, in favour of one or other of the administrations, may be paid either in Turkish pounds, in pounds sterling, or in 20-franc pieces. Should the balance be in favour of the Indian Administration, payment shall be made by Turkey into the hands of the delegate of that Administration at Constantinople ; and should it be in favour of the Ottoman Administration, payment shall be made by the aforesaid delegate to the Director- General of the Ottoman Telegraphs. XIU. In order to facilitate and accelerate the operations relating to the reciprocal settlement of the quarterly accounts with ihe Central Administration of Ottoman telegraphs, the Indian Government shall be entitled to appoint a delegate to reside at Constantinople, the seat of that administration The Ottoman Government shall likewise be entitled to name a delegate for the same purpose, to reside at the seat of the Central Telegraphic Administration of the Indian Government. The respective delegates shall be entitled to receive from the respective Central Administrations all the information and explanations which they may require. XIV. All messages to or from India may be forwarded indifferently, as may be most convenient for the service, either by the line of Bussorah or by that of Khanakain. XV. It is well understood that the Ottoman Government shall be in account- current, and shall have direct administrative relations with the Government of India in respect to all messages, whether sent by the frontier of Fao or by the Persian route of Khanakain.

And the aforesaid distinguished representatives, after meeting in the capital of Teheran and perusing and exchanging their letters of full power, and finding them to be in due order, have concluded the following Articles:— '• Article I. In order to improve the telegraphic communication between Europe and India, the Persian Government agrees to attach another wire to the poles now standing from Bushire to Khanakain, and to bring it into working order as soon as possible. The wire to be used solely for international messages sent in European languages II . In order that the second wire may be attached in a complete and effective manner, the Persian Government also agrees that it shall lie done under the direction and supervision of an English Engineer Officer and staff; and the Persian Govern ment will use its best endeavours to collect the necessary materials and lay down the wire with all expedition. III. The British Government agrees to procure for the Persian Government at a reasonable price and with the cognizance of a Persian Commissioner all the wire, insulators, morse instruments, Ac., that may be requisite for this work, inclusive of 200 iron posts for the marshy tracts of Bushire, and to deliver them over to the Government Commissioners at any seaports or frontier towns of Persia that may be suitable, receiving payment in live years in live instalments. IY r . The Persian Government, moreover, agrees that an English Telegraph Officer with the necessary staff not exceeding 50 in number exclusive of families, shall be •engaged from the opening of telegraphic communication through the new wire for five years in organising the Persian line of telegraph, and giving instructions in telegraphy. And the British Government agrees that the English officer and his staff shall, at the expiration of the prescribed period, make over the said line to the Persian Government and cease connection with Persian Telegraph. V. The conditions under which the English officer shall exercise control over the second wire during the prescribed period are stated in the following rules : — 1. His Royal Highness the Itizad-es-Sultaneh, Minister of Science, or any other person who, by the Shah’s order, may be appointed in his place, is to be considered the head and absolute chief of all the Persian Government 'Telegraphs. 2. Any order which Bis Royal Highness, or such other person in his place, may issue, concerning the protection of the line, its working, and the Persians employed • on it, shall be given through and with the approval of the English Telegraph Officer. 5949 B10 3. For the protection of the line the whole distance from the .Turkish f rontier to Bushire shall be divided from station to station into six sections as follows :— From n &gt;7 77 the 'Turkish frontier to Hamadan. Hamadan to Teheran. 'Teheran to Oashan. Cashan to Ispahan. Ispahan to Sheraz. Sheraz to Bushire. To each of these divisions the Itizad-es-Sultaneh shall appoint a Persian officer, who will be responsible to Mis Royal Highness for the protection of the line situated within his limits. To enable the said Persian officer, or Yaver. of each division to carry out his duties efficiently, a certain number of horsemen shall be stationed under his orders along the line. The Yaver will, of course, accept any suggestions which the Fnglish Telegraph Officer may give with reference to his charge, due regard being had to the customs of Persia and her power of carrying out such suggestions. T. The organisation of offices and instruction of employes shall be exclusively in charge of the English Superintending Officers, who will be responsible for the working of the line in these respects ; and the Persian signallers shall be ordered to obey implicitly the instructions which the English officers may irive in the performance of their duties. 5. In case of insubordination or misconduct on the part of the Persian signallers, His Royal Highness the Jtizad-es-Sultaneh engages to use his best endeavours in lawdully supporting the authority of the English Superintending Officer, exercised under the last rule. On the other hand, the English officer engages that the bounds of that authority shall in no way be exceeded. 6 . The English officer shall have nothing whatever to do with receipts of money. A Mirza will be appointed at each station, who will be directly responsible for the accounts to the Itizad-es-Sultaneh. But the English Superintending Officer shall render to His Royal Highness, or any person who may be appointed by the Persian Government, such account of the telegrams despatched under his authority as may be sufficient of full information. These rules, however general in some sense.', are understood to have special application to the second wire. \ I. In filling up vacancies which may occur among the signallers employed under Article 1\ ., the English lelegraph Officer shall give the preference to natives of Persia, provided they be qualified, in his estimation, by knowledge of the English language, and other attainments necessary for this service, to perform the duties required. YU. As the Telegraph Offices of these two wires ought to be distinct, the Persian Government shall build a new office adjoining the existing one, wherever there are not separate rooms. VIII. II any injury befall the second wire, or delay occur through press of traffic, the first wire, which is specially used for internal communication in Persia, shall give assistance to the second wire and vice versa. 1-^E Toi every message ol Ju words or less from Khanakain to Bushire, or vice li i sa, one toman, live krans and eight shahisbn Persian money, or 14 shillings m English money, shall be chaiged, with proportionate rates for the intervening towns. The Persian Government accepts the tariff laid down in the last convention between I urkey and England so lar as regards the rates of messages sent bv the two Governments from Bushire to India and from Khanakain to Constantinople or Europe. X. The yearly receipts will be credited to the Persian Treasury, but should they reach a higher sum than thirty thousand tomans, the surplus will be made over to the officers of the English Government for the cost of their establishment. XI. All Indian messages at whatever part of the line or from whatever place received shall be given over to the second wire, and the accounts regularly kept. XII. Should the traffic so continuously increase as to demand more than is in one day the fair day’s work on the second wire, the excess of telegrams shall be handed over for despatch to the first wire, the money received on them being separately credited to the Persian Government. 'The adjustment of this matter shall rest with the Itizad-es-Sultaneh and the English Superintending Officer. This article is quite irrespective of the provision for mutual assistance in the event of a slight and temporary delay. XIII. I he cost of all othei than Indian or submarine e*able messages shall be separately credited to the Persian Treasury, although conveyed by the second wire. * ♦12 are under the sovereignty of Persia, the payment of the above sum being made 10 m the day on which the work ol laying the wires is commenced.

With regard to the boundaries of the Telegraph Establishment at Jask, in accordance with the information received by the 1 ersian Government and the Hritish 1301 (25th February 1887). That the Telegraph Establishment, which is situated at a distance ol 800 yards from the point take possession of 000 yards more to the north of the Telegraph Establishment, /.e., 400 yards from the present boundary fence between which and the Telegraph Establishment is a distance of 200 yards, making a total from tl e end of the promontory to the limits of 000 yards; at the end of those 000 yards a wire boundary will be drawn and the Government of dask shall have no right whatsoever on any account whatever to interfere in the interior of those limits. As the Telegraph Establishment w'ell is about 1,000 yards distant from the boundary agreed upon, it is decided that the road and water-way from the well to the place where they meet the limits be protected and no one shall build upon, destroy or interfere with them ; and for the preservation of the well itself it is agreed to set aside a space around the well to be walled in at a distance all round of 100 yards from the well. The customs and other buildings of the Persian Government Agent /must be without the limits above agreed upon and be built on the place agreed uporf between Mr. Flinch and the Malek-i-Tajjar. It is agreed that the Telegraph olficials and their true, positive and salaried servants be exempted from Customs dues. .It is agreed that stores for provisions and the necessaries of existence which are brought from the interior for the Telegraph Establishment, such as rice, ghee, wood, &amp;e,, and such like, be exempt from taxation. It is agreed that if any of ihe dependants of dask, other than the true, positive and salaried servants of the Telegraph Establishment, in order to take sanctuary or protection penetrate within the limits, the Telegraph officials shall have no right to protect them ; on the contrary, they should place them without their boundary and hand them over to the Government of dask. Any merchant, native or foreign, who may have shops within the limits must pay the usual Customs dues on that which he imports in order to trade, buy or sell. That which llis Excellency the Ameen es-Sultan, Minister of Finance and of the Palace, has written is correct and is registered in the Foreign Office of the Persian Government. Instead of the new* fence being erected at a distance of 400 yards and parallel to the old fence right across the point, a line was to be drawn from the West Bay, 150 yards from the old fence, and continued parallel to it to within 100 feet of Telegraph line, thence parallel to Telegraph line till it met new boundary 400 yards from old fence.

Besides the ordinary work of Inspection I was entrusted as you are aware with presents* to H.M.the Shah and some high Persian Officials and had been placer 1 in communication with the Foreign Office for special duty of a diplomatic nature during my passage through Persia. I had also been instructed by the Government of India to visit Simla on mv outward way. 3. I left london on the 25th March and travellins via Brindisi arrived at Karachi on the I4th April. After spending three days in conferring with Mr.Pfinch nirector of the Persian Gulf Section and inspecting the Offices, storehouses, workshops and Gable factory I proseeded to Simla where I remained a week. Returning to Karachi I embarked on board the “Patrick Stewart* and after visiting Owadur.Jashk,Muscat ; ' M MB’''' - ^ ^ ^ * •«* Bushi re, and Pao I finally landed at Bushire on the I7th May.

Afterr.erl, r„„r „„„ duties at Teheran I went back by post to r*n a &gt; . y post to Ispahan to see H.R.h. the 2 ii es Sultan returning in t h same m anner to Teheran. Remaining a week there « i iere to complete what I had t.„ h • nad to do with thepBPVHMNHNHMMIINI Persian Authorities and to allow my baggage to reach the Caspian I went by post to Resht and thence via Baku t Batoum \ . Constantinople t and Vienna to London which I reached on the £7th inst.. 4, I found the Establishments at Karachi,Gwadur,Jashk, Bushire,and Pao,(the only Stations of the Persian Gulf Section which t visited)in a state of good order and efficiency.Part of one of the Sheds in the cable factory' at Manors was in an unsafe state and will have to be repaired or rebuilt.With this exception all the building at the above Stations appeared to be in srood condition. They were minutely inspected on the part of the Public Works Department by Colonel H aydon R.E. who accompanied me in the Patrick Stewart and who has no doubt made a report of his inspection to Government. The Persian line and Offices I also found in good working order. The insulation of the line is somewhat defective in bad weather owing to the leakage of the iron-hooded Siemen’s insulators. This defect is being remedied by the gradual substitution of Johnston ann Phillip’s Pluid Insulators on the wire habitually used for through messapes. The new quarters at Shiraz recently built by Hyder all Khan Nawab and leased to us are most satisfactory in every respect. The situation about half a mile outside the town is excellent,and the buildings are all that could be desired. The health of the staff in this formerly very unhealthy Station has greatly improved in consequence* e 5. Of my proceedings at Simla it is unnecessary in this Report to do more than refer to the Memoranda (copies en- c1osed)which I there submitted to the Government of India on the question of amalgamation with the Indian Telegraph \ -“NDepartment and on the reorganization of the Persian Telepranh with a view to utilizing the staff as muchas possible for practical work. In continuation of the latter Memorandum I also enclose a opy of the letter from Teheran which subsequent ly addressed to the Government of India after discussing with Mr.Nicolson as I had been authorized by H.R.the Viceroy to do the proposals submitted in that Memorandum. ] i * \ * 1. • 6 . Shortly before my departure from England a verv trouble some question had arisen regarding our Fsiablishment at Jashk which I must refer to m orddr to explain the action which I took regarding it, 7. Some years ago (in 1878 I believe) the Bombay Government sent a guard of Sepoys to Jashk,presumably for the protection of the Station but so far as I know without any application from the Telegraph Department and certainly without the knowledge of the Persian Government. The guard was graduallv increased until it numbered a full Company with three native officers. Permanent barracks were built near the Telegraph Office for their accomodation. A considerable villase spranr up occupied partly by our native employes and the Servants of of the Telegranh Staff with their families and partly by boatmen and small traders not in our service.* small period ical contribution for sanitary purposes was levied bv the Director of the Persian Gulf Section on each householder.' The Mail Steamers called repularly and the whole place wore the loofcof a small Indian Military Station. Stranpe as it may seem,the Persian Government was totally unaware of this state of affairs. How it was brought to their notice I do not know. The wonder is that they should have remained so lone in ^ ignorance. Whenjthe presence of the Sepoys at last became.2* known at Teheran,the Shah was naturally very indignant,the more so that they had already been nine years in Persian territory without his knowledge. The infringement of his sovereignty was probably all the more galling thatiit ^ occured in a district formerly farmed from Persia by the Sultan of Muskat,and over which the Persian Government had only recently resumed direct control. 8 . Before leaving London I had reccomended the removal of the Sepovs,and while at Simla I had advised the Government of India to countermand the police guard which was being prepared to take their place. There was no greater danger to our staff at Jashk than at any other station,and police. in the eyes of the Persians would have been merely soldiers under another name. fa. Besides the question of Sepoys,another about Juris diction had arisen re R ardin B the villa B e. Manned at our encroachments,the idea of a line of boundary beyond which they were not to extend and within which the Persians were not to interfere,was favourably received at Teheran,and an m agreement embodying it was concluded between Vr.tficol son, H.M’s.Charge d’affaires,and H.E. Amin es Sultan,on the part of the Persian Government. *s Jashk is unquestionably in Persian territory,it is a matter of wonder that Vr.Nicolson should have succeeded under the circumstances in getting the Government at Teheran to entertain the idea of any such boundary,and to make a formal agreement reparding it entir* IV to our advantage. Some afterthought of the kind seems to have been suggested to the Persian Ministers by. the Commissioners one after the other whom they sent to dashk to see the agreement carried into effect. fi feeling of soreness possessed the Shah and his Ministers which f ered. inter-seriously with all our interests,and stood in the wav of many important matters, A slight discrepancy between some of the measurements mentioned in the agreement,and those on a plan of ^ the ground,subsequently made was taken advantage of by the Persian Commissioner as a means of upsetting the whole agree ment, * 10. This was the state of affairs when I arrived at Karachi from Simla and received a telegram from Mr.Nicolson requesting me to proceed to Jashk and endeavour t&lt;&gt; come to seme satis factory understanding with the Persian Commissioner on the spot. Fortunately I had previously arranged,for another purpose,to take passage in the “Patrick Stewart' instead of the mail steamer,so that I had no difficulty in complving with his r.equest, 11, An account of my proceedings at Jashk,and of the settle ment there made with the Persian Agent,which was afterwards appended to the original agreement,will be found in the en closed copy of my report to Mr.Nicolson dated I2th May 1887. IZ, For the successful issue of my efforts to effect an amicable and satisfactory settlement of what had becume a most embarrassing question I have to thank Mr.Nicolson. The exceptionally favourable terms of the agreement which he had concluded with the Persian Governmant left ample room for the perfectly harmless concession which happily satisfied their wounded pride,and his prompt support at Teheran of each step taken by me at Jashk enabled me to make that concession with the desired effect. 13. As the treaty with Persia by virtue of which we maintain the station at Jashk and the land line thence Eastward to the frontier was about to expire,the whole future of the Indo- European Telegraph depended on the early settlement of theabove question, A somewhat detailed explanation of it, therefore,seemed called for in this report, 14, My visit to Pao was for the purpose of reporting upon a Turkish fort to which I had drawn the attention of Her Majesty’s Government, I had intended to march by caravan stages,the whole way along the line of telegraph from. Bushire to Teheran paying on the way a visit at Ispahan.to His Royal Highness the 3il es Sultan for whom some of the presents were intended. On recahing Shiraz however I heard from Mr.Nicolson,who begged me to hasten my arrival in Teheran, that the Shah intended leaving for Mazanderan.at tie at the end of the Ramazan,then just begun,and that,the Zil es Sultan had gone away into w estern Persia whence he would nnt return to Isnahan till the Ramazan was over. I therefore decided to ride to Teheran as rapidly as possible by nost so as to be there for some time before the Shah’s departure,and return afterwards to Ispahan to see the Sil es Sultan, Prom the 9th June when I reached Teheran until the oth July,when I left for Ispahan I was constantly em ployed in concert with Mr.Nicol son,in negotiations with the p ersian Ministers, 15, Hefore leaving England I had called attention to the fact that the Telegraph treaty generally known as the Jashk convention expired in April 1888,and instructions had been sent to Mr.Nicolson to obtain ite renewal. As already ex plained, the difficulties which had arisen at Jashk itself atood in the way of any such renewal being listened to by the Persian Government. Those difficulties however having been settled in such a manner as to evoke the thanks of the Shah and his Ministers,the question of the renewal was brought forward by Mr.Nicolson immediately after my arriraldiplomacy of Russia now directed at Teheran by Rrince Dolgorouky,who,fran his high social position and other fav- « ouring circumstances,has very exceptional influence. 19. Por an account of the presentation of the gifts to His Maiesty the Shah and His Roual Highness the ?Jil es P * m Multan,! beg to refer to the enclosed copies of the reports which T addressed to M r.Nicolson. The presents to His Higrmess the Mushir ed Dowleh and His Excellency the Hukhber b e - • ‘ *- ■ ■ ed Dowleh were of course made with Mcb less formality. There is no doubt that the gifts had an excellent effect and that they could not have been presented at a more oppor tune moment. X cannot conclude this report without expressing my ^ ‘ li warmest thanks to Mr.Vioolson for the kind and constant support which he unRrcdginRly pave me,and my admiration of the great resource and unfailing tact which he showed in all his dealings with the Persian Government in which I had the honour and pleasure of being bis associate.

I was already aware before leagmg England that such a feeling existed,and that the Persian Minister in London had,by direct orders from the Shah him- si.lf.made very urgent representations about our Jashk estahlish- -ments to «.«-s Govt. The Perstan Govt.had had.in my opinion aoch just causes of complaint against us that I confess I was much as- -tomsheo when I saw at Karachi the extremely liberal te^s of the agreement which you had succeeded in concluding with H.B.the *meen es Seltan,a copy of wmch I enclose for ready reference in connec- W “ h ^ ' ,P ' r, ” r •' ■« OTC , ;r . d .» «*. - ... prlvll .

I arrived at Jashk in the “Patrick Stewart' early on the morr- j -lor of the [oth Inst,and immediately after he ARent &lt;Mllza know that I should be happy to see him. He at once i came over to the Tela B raph Office where we had a long conversation on general subjects unconnected with Jashk.in the course of which I found that he knew several of my Persian friends and acquaintances in Shiraz. This circumstan.e soon gave a friendly and less formal character to our interview. Coming gradually to business I was somewhat dissapointed to find that the Hoetemed-es-Sultan.Halek-ed Tudj ar, Bushira, under whise immediate orders he had acted,had failed to fulfil his promise to Colonel Hoss to inform the Agent by Tele graph of my coming and the object of my visit. This did not look encouraging,and still less did the manifest want of good faith implied in the plea which the Agent forthwith set up regarding the new boundary specified in the agreement. The meaning of the agree- -ment was of course perfectly clear and simple.but he insisted that WL “ d&lt;,finite inStrUetion » ^ superiors he must stick to the letter of the agreemen t, viz : - that the new bo , ndapy ^ be ^ /ards ^ (not nArth east)of tha pres0nt ^ the sea. He admitted that this was nnnh=Ki was probably not what was intended, but repeated that he had no authority to agree fro m any departure from the meaning of the text. Seeing that further discussion was not only useless but dangerous,as tending to accentuate differences on «.h.r ,„ ld , , ?ll . h „ .n» I .hnm. h „ frm itj bv getting him distinct instructions with as little r ^ a ^ as little delay as possible. He threrupon took his leave.and I addressed a t-i . i addressed a telegram to Colonel Ross and a copy of the sam« / 1 you, (enclosure No. 5) requestiong that distinct orders should ho ^ , should be Telegraphed to Mirza Hidayet as to the position of the new boundary. .n .n. non... „„„ rspiY nn.,, .un, .un . .... . f , h , -hioh hMso promptly odtamed from H, E. the An in-•■-Sul tan (enclosure No. 7) This of course put an end to the frivolous contention which the Apert, evidently astinp under orders fr^m the w a l ek-ed-Tud,1 ar, had set up. Meantime also I had received a reply from Colonel Ross ^Enclosure No.8). No. corr.municati.on however came from the Malek-ed- -Tudjar.who appears to me to have been playm* a double part throu- ghout. Immediately after the receipt of the Amm-es-Sul tan* s teleeram I went with the A Re nt to show him on the ground the position of the new boundary which had already been marked, out 400 yards beyond,and parallel to,the old fence. After looking at it he asked where the Govt. House, the Custom House, and the bander, (landin R )were to be. 1 t0ld hlm ^ ^ free t0 Ch — be y°nd the boundary, but pointed ““ ■»* •»• annexed Plan.

He at last said he had a propr- to make which he hoped I would agree to.vizt-to give up to him from our reserve a strip along the north-west shore ,,00 yards wide,and stretching from the old fence to the new boundary line,so as to enable him to establish himself conveniently in the only inhabited part of the place. As the indicated strip took in the hole of village his request was tantamount to asking us to give up all that the agreement had secured to us in the wav or i ah tne way of immunity from Persian interference with uor own «mni , ° r own ^Ployes and servants. As t WLSh9d 31 thiS Staee of Proceedings to avoid as much a awin as muen as r&gt;op*ihl all reference to the tender point of .urisdiction.t affected not to Perceive any object in his proposal other than *^at he urged viz:• • Q convenience of situation,snifrableness for buildings,*c, t told him •f however ^ a f it was quite impossible to entertain a pfroposal which involved not a mere modification,but a complete anhilation,of the Agreement. He said that had the Persian Govt.been aware that our preserve comprised within its lunits the abadi (Inhabited port- xon) they would never have made the agreement. I repli.d that they knew perfectly well what they were about as they had sisned in explanation of the agreement a map on which the whole of the vill age was distinctly shown within the new boundary. »e spoke several times about telegranhin® on this point to Teheran.but I declined either to do so myself or to await at Jashk the result of any such reference by him wvipn + wh-n abo^t to go on board (by this time it .h. nif&gt;h&amp;,and „ , .„ ala ^ wishes I should be very glad. , . I then said “Your object,as I understand,is to get convenient sites for the Oovt.Buildings and boat landings on the shore of the bay (pointing to it, instead of on the other bay beyond our boundary,and you assure me that if this can be obtained you will be perfectly satisfied* He said,*Yes you have exactly stated my wishes and I shall be very thankful if you can see your way to granting them'. After repeating the above statement of his ostensible object,with the remark I feared it would be very difficult if not impossible of attainment,! went on board for the mgnt, I had already come to the conclusion that the agreement had secured all that was required to meet his wishes as thus specified,but I thought it better to defer saying so until, after another examination of the ground by myself m daylight,! could make a distinct proposal in the form of a free and final concession. The following morning ( accordingly made a careful survey (with exact measurements) of the ground, 400 yards in length by about 200 in width,lying between the old fence ana tu - ce and the new boundary occupied by the village, and decided to offer him the farther h»ir «#•i®,and reserve for ourselves the nearer in which I had observed all the better houses were situated,and in which all our bona fide 'IrtTLll y9S lived * [ aocordin B lv sent for him,and standing in the middle of the villa R e showed him the portion whose boundaries were jrt ready marked out which I proposed to cede. He was evidently somewhat astonished at such a lar e e concession beinp made with the sole condition that it should be clearly understood that it entire- -ly satisfied all his wants. He said it did and he accepted it wtth many thanks. We then walked over the .round and examined it in detail,when he be* P ed me to add a few yards so as to include a dry water course which'he thought would be useful. „y addinR ^ -rds I saw that besi.es a watercourse a very RO o d buildin* site on its nearer, and therefore in his evec, ^ ^ nis eyes more desirable,bank would eluded. I therefore drew the line 50 yards nearer the Tele graph buildin.s,which R ave him 250 of the whole 400 vards. The landward boundary of the ceded portion I drew t 00 f 9et short of and parallel to,the line of telepraph posts. The Agent havin. expressed his entire satisfaction, I told him it remained to be seen whether yo ; would consent to such a lar R e concession,addin, that I had assigned .reat responsibility in propositi, it. I said C had acted solely from a desire to satisfv hias-lf and through him the Persian Govt, and that I would use mybe best endeavours to obtain bv tele.raph your sanction of my proposals With a view to havin. a distinct record of the transaction,I told the Agent that, he should at the same time to the Ameen-es-Sultan and obtain His Excellency's sanction of the proposed modification of the agreement. He accordin.lv sent a to''•.ram in this sense to the Ameen-es-Sul t an (enclosure Wo.9. )a copv of which T forwarded to you with the telegram(enclosure No. Io)in which 1 recommended the above proposals for your approval. My reason for suggesting that you should if possible contrive that the Ameen-es-Sul tan* s reply should contain some expression of thanks was this, that I thought it very desirable to have some official record of the fact that themodification of the agreement was. a free concession and act of graee on our part f in cush full satisfaction of the wishes as well a« the rights of the Persian (rovt. as to elicit His Pxcellencv’s thanks. In other words that the Persian authorities sho’ld feel _and state that we had been not only Just but generous. In the course of the afternoon I received your reply (Fnclosure K T o. II) approving ^fimy proceedings and forwarding a copy of the Ameen-as-Sultan’s reply to the Agent (Enclosure Mo. 12) and a tele- gram of tnanks (Enclosure Mo. 13) from the Ameen-es-Sul tan to myself. A conv of the Ameen-es-Sul tan * s jAfcgfi'am teleoram to the Aeent was at my sufrpestion sent to the «alak-ed-T’;U .1 ar. On receipts of these telegrams,! again went with the agent, Wr.ffinch and the Superintendent in charge of the Telegraph station, over the new boundary,which in the mean time had been prominently marked out with telegraph poles. In the Agent-s pre.ace. I directed the Superintendent to begin at once the erection of the permanent boundary fence for which the necessary materials had been brought from Karachi in the “Patrick Stewart”. The boundary question once satisfactorily settled f no others presented any difficulty. I gave directions that the Agent should be furnished with a list,to be corrested as occasion required,of all our employes and servants,to whom,with their families,the right of living within our reserve should be restricted. I also arranged with him that such other persons as now lived there should be warned to find quarters outside the boundary within a period of three moths. It was agreed also that if any question or dispute should arise between the Persians and &lt;-&gt;ur people, it should be settled by the Agent and Superintendent in friendly conforence. After everything had been settled I invited the Agent to ac- -eompanv me to din. on board ship,and presented him with a double barrelled gun as a souvenir. I should mention that Mr.Assistant Superintendent Allen,chosen for the purpose by Mr. Pfmch on account of his conciliatory ^ispos--ition and colloquial knowledge of Persian,had come with us in the Patiick Stewart* to remain at Jashk for some months in special charge of our relations with the Agent, while at Simla I informed the Government of India that Colonel jjoss and Mr. Pfinch concurred with me in the opinion that the pro posed Police cruard of *0 men mieht without risk be disponed with. A telegram was consequent^ sent to the Chief commissioner in Sind to suspend the preparation and equipment of the guard in question. If necessary we can engage a few local watchmen to patrol the neighbourhood of the Telegraph buildings at night. Before leavin* Karachi I had telegraphed to the Poreign Secretary to the Govt.of India requesting that the Sepoy detachment should be remoy ftd wlth a. little delay as possible, and on my arrival at Jashk I found that arrangements had been mad* • o en made for their embarkation in the mail Steamer -Assyria* due at Jashk to-day.

The correspondence concerns questions over the extent of the concession area of (and jurisdiction within) the telegraph station at Jask (also spelt Jashk). These questions arose from the withdrawal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department (IETD) from Persia [Iran] in 1932, and the takeover of its facilities by Imperial &amp; International Communications Limited. The file’s correspondence covers the Persian authorities’ understanding that the original concession was no longer valid, their dismantling of the boundary fence around the telegraph station, and the construction of buildings within the original concession area.The file contains copies of correspondence dated 1887, including reports from Colonel Robert Murdoch Smith, Director in Chief of the IETD Persian section (ff 89-108), and copies of various agreements ranging in date from 1861 to 1932, relating to the operation and ownership of the telegraph line in Persia (ff 65-88).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indo-European Telegraph Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Jask</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral agreements</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Jurisdiction</topic></subject><subject><topic>Indo-European Telegraph Line</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000020#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
