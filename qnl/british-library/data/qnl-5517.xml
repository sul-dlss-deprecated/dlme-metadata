Memorandum: With reference to the memorandum No. 471 of Tyr 30th, 1313 (July 21st, 1934) of the honourable Legation regarding the search made by the customs officials in the house of Latif, the ferrash of the British Vice-Consulate in Zahedan, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to state that, although a reply was given in the course of the notes Nos. 2963/32594 and 4246/40825 to the matter, further enquiries were made from the competent quarters on the receipt of H.L. Sir Reginald Hoare’s Note No. 203 of Farvardine 25th, 1313 (April 14th, 1934). The replies received in this connection confirm the views formerly expressed by this Ministry, namely, that the officials concerned have not perpetrated any act contrary to the stipulations of international law in taking this action.

Hie Majesty's Legation ' present their compliments to the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs and hare the honour to acknowledge the receipt of their note Mo. 18620/1867 of November 22nd, 1934 (Asar 1st, 1313), regarding the entry of customs officials into His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Z&amp;hedan. His Majesty's Legation regret the Ministry's apparent decision to leave the matter in so unsatisfactory a positior and also the fact that, in placing their arguments upon the basis of international law, the Ministry appear to have misunder stood the purport of the original representations of His Majesty's legation, in which the raising of any question of international law was intentionally avoided. In the United Kingdom the police would, in ordinary circumstances, not search a private house, far less a foreign Consulate, without a warrant and even if they were in hot pursuit of a felon, they would not follow him into a /foreignforeign Consulate without first asking permission to enter* 4* From the plan, which was enclosed in Sir R«H* Hoare f s note No* 203 of the 14th April (Farwardine 26th) last, it is clear that the house which was searched is indisputably situated within the boundaries of the Vice- Consulate, and fro^ evidence in the possession of His Majesty's Legation, it is equally clear that tnere was no question of hot pursuit* It way be added that as soon as the servant’s guilt was discovered, he was at once dismissed by the Vice-Consul* 5* In addressing the Ministry on this subject, far from raising any question of international law His Majesty’s Legation rested their arguments on the basis of that international courtesy which is common between nations and which they had felt convinced the Persian authorities would have appreciated*Notes.

T O Q / 7 ! ftritieh Tehran •193 4 j Slat iarch, 1934. ir Sir, I have the honour to report upon an entry of Persian Customs Frontier Guards into the compound of Hia Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Zahidan which occurred on August 3rd, 1933. 2. On that date four guards searched the rooms of a Persian Ferrash situated in the grounds of the Vice- Consulate, apparently without a warrant, and without informing the Vice-Consul before commencing the search. A sack of sugar was in fact discovered by the Customs Guards; this sugar had presumably been obtained from a smuggler, as the servant could give no plausible explanation of how he had acquired it. The servant waa forthwith dismissed by liis i&amp;ajeaty's Vice-Consul, who at the same time protested to the local Governor against the discourtesy of the action of the Customs Guards. 3. Inquiry was then a&amp;cte of His Majesty’s Consul- General for Khoraaan whether the servant's quarters were unmistakably within the Vice-Consulate enclosure and an affirmative reply was received, it was decided to protest against the discourtesy of tne methods employed by the Customs officials. I informed the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs of the facts in a note dated Hovember 2&amp;th last, and received on January 15th, a reply which merely stated that '•the place which was searched was not considered /as The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign officeas feeing the feuilciing of the British Vice-Conaulate. * 4# I did not regard this reply as adequate and in a further note dated February 5th I expressed ayself willing to fee eonwinoed that the local officials acted under a Misapprehension feut could not consider the explanation furnished as sufficient to close the incident# I then received a note dated February 11th couched in rather vague and badly expressed Persian which was presumed to mean (a) that the local authorities did not recognise the building as feeing part of the Vice-Consulate, (fe) that, even if they had so considered it, they could still not have asked permission because of the nature of the case# The note added 'Your Excellency will Moreover admit that a courtesy is not to fee placed on the game level as that of a right and that in accordance with the established international rules it is not possible to object to the inspection which has been made of the place fey necessity.* To this I replied in a note No# 92 of February 17th saying first that I found it difficult to believe that the Customs officials did not know that the house entered formed part of the Vice-Consulate premises, and secondly that I learned with regret that in the Minister of Foreign Affairs' view even had the officials realised this, that they would nevertheless have been justified in carrying out the search without notification to the Vice-Consul and the production of the search warrant which I presumed them to have had. Finally X said I admitted that there is a distinction between the obligations of courtesy and absolute rights, but I pointed out that I had so far made no mention of 'rights' and had no desire to embark upon a controversy regarding the legal aspects of the esse if /this. vi:' thi» could l&gt;e aroidtd. I hare ao far received no reply to this note and there the aatter at present resta.
