Dated the 6th May 1041, The fallowing are relevant extracts from the Anglo«»Iraq Treaty of Alliance which waa ratified on the 26th January 1031. v - Article 4, become engaged in war the other high contracting party will immediately eonoert together the necessary measures for defence. The aid of His Majesty the King of Iraa in the event of war or Imminent menace of war will consist of furnishing His Britannic Majesty with all facilities in Iraq territory and with all the assistance in his power, including the use of railways, river ports, aerodromes and' other means of communication.' Article 5 t responsibility for the maintenance of internal order in Iraq and for the defence of Iraq against external aggres sion rests with the King of Iraq, Nevertheless the King of Iraq recognises that the pezm&amp;nent maintenance and protection in ail circumstances of the communications essential to His Britannic Majesty is in the common interest of both partieoi For this purpose and in order to facilitate the discharge of his obligations to His Bri tannic Majesty under Article 4, the King of Iraq under takes to grant to His Britannic Majesty for the duration ’♦Should either of the high contracting parties ♦♦It is understood between the parties that the ofof the alliance for air-bases at or in the vicinity of Basra and west of the Euphrates. The King o* Iraa further authorises His Britannic. Majesty to maintain forces upon Iraq territory in the above localities on the understanding that the presence of thesa forces shall not constitute any form of occupation and will in no way prejudice the sovereign rights of Iraq.” There is an annexure to this treaty, under Article 3 of which the King of Iraq 'agrees to afford, when requested to do so by His Majesty f s Government, all facilities for the movement of British Forces and arms in transit across Iraq and for the transport and storage of all supplies and equipment that may be required by these Forces during their passage across Iraq. These facilities shall cover the use of roads, railways, water ways, ports and aerodromes and His Britannic Majesty^ ships shall have general permission to visit the Shatt-al- Arab, provided prior notification is given.' This treaty remains in force for a period of 25 years from the date when it came into force. 2* To form some idea of the present political set up in Iraq, it is necessary to go back at least as far as 1936, to the first military coup d’etat engineered by Bakir Sidqi, the then Commander of the Mosul area. The present 'golden square' or Amy Big Four, of whom more later, were then supporters of Bakir though at that time they were still comparatively junior Officers. But military predominance in Iraqi politics is traceable from this date. After seizing power, Bakir Sidqi became Chief of Staff and had as his Prime Minister Hikmat Suleiman (since imprisoned by Nuri Pasha)* In 1937, while on his way to Germany to attend German manoeuvres at the invitation of the Nazis, he was assassinated in Mosul, together with the Commander of the Iraqi Air Force, who had been one of his supporters. HikmatSuleiman ordered the Commander of the Mosul area to hand over the officers who had plotted the murders 5 but the latter refused and declared Mosul independent of Baghdad, Hikmat resigned and Jamil Madfai(now recognised as one of Iraqis elder statesmen and who was recently working for the overthrow of Rashid Ali) formed a Ministry,. The members of the present 'Golden square' were then well in the background. About a year later Nuri Pasha returned from Egypt and replaced Jamil Madfai constitutionally. Rashid Ali, who had been exiled in the Lebanon by Bak-iT* Sidqi, also returned and joined Nuri’s cabinet as Minister of the Interior. Soon after the wgr* broke out, Nuri was forced to reconstruct his Ministry. This time he left out Rashid Ali, whom he regarded as a dangerous riyal. appointing him Adviser to the Regent(Abdul ! Ilah) c In June 1940, Nuri, who was too pro-British to please some of the Iraqis, resigned on the ostensible point of breaking diplomatic relations with Italy, and Rashid formed a Cabinet, with himself as Prime Minister and Nuri as Foreign Minister. It is about this time that Rashid developed pro-Axis tendencies and the 'golden square', who as a result of numerous political dismissals had received unusually rapid promotion, found themsol^os, as comparatively young men, in high positions of com bined power. Nuri now resigned and was replaced by Taufiq as Suwaidi. Taufiq was shortly afterwards dismissed but as a result of pressure by Nuri, the Regent and Jamil Madfai, as a part of their campaign to force the resignation of Rashid Ali, he was reinstated. Rashid Ali resigned in January of this year, and Taha Hashimi formed a Ministry, with himself as Premier. Taha had been for some years Minister of Defence in successive Governments and found it difficult to dissociate himself from his former comrades, the Army Big Four. Also his Ministrycontained an ex-Presidont and the existing President of the Palestine Defence Society and there is some suspicion that Rashid Ali resigned in collusion with Taha and that the whole affair had not only the approval of the ex- Mufti but also of the Italian Legation. The Golden Square now became more inf luontia 1 than over and backed Rashid Ali. It was obvious that Taha had no intention of trying conclusions with this pov/erful clique and in fact it appeared that the Government and the opposition had both decided to observe a discreet silence on such controversial questions as the removal of the Italian Legation from Baghdad. Despite the efforts of Nuri and Jamil Madfai to obtain a clear statement, the Government and the opposition, backed or frightened by the Army, whre able to carry on with their negative policy. It was at this time, March 1941, that Taufik as Suwaidi, as Foreign Minister, flew to Cairo to see Mr. Eden and Taha must have con sidered him a most disruptive element in his Cabinet. Iraqi politics had now resolved themselves into the simple question, was the Italian Legation to go or not? But it was not so simple to answer. Axis money, distributed by the Italians, personal ambitions and intrigues and army pro-Axis sympathies, all combined to make Taha*8 position very difficult and Taufiq as Su waidi, although he was convinced that a pro-British policy was the best for Iraq and was supported by some other members of the Cabinet, could not persuade Taha to take any step which might give direct offence to Rashid or the as yet unbroken Golden Square. In his capacity as Defence Minister,however, Taha did endeavour to scatter the Army Big Four, but they refused to leave the posts they were occupying. As s Premier, he had to review this order and actually agreed to reconsider the orders he had already issued as Defenceand Taufic, (wLo v/aro apparently really frightened of Rashid, the ez-Mnfti and the Army) but not by the Regent 0 At the same time, Rashid Ali ? s new Party the 'Hizb al Sha 2 b Jf (Nationalist party), although still unconstitutional t was offerring a direct threat to the continuance of Taha : s Ministry and it was only a week later that Rashid seized power by force and the Regent, Nuri, Jamil Madfai and other moderates were forced to flee Baghdad. Subsequent events you know e At first Rashid Ali seemed conciliatory, possibly owing to Axis set-backs in the Balkans and consequent lack of promised aid, but as soon as we had to evacuate Greece, he became bolder and we can now only hope he has over-reached itself c 3c PERSO NALITIES, 'THE GOLDEN SQUARE' (ll.

I-H 2 P t k n , t&lt;|.VB &lt;Y CCNFIDEHTIAli. 0.0. Vo. C/288 Political Agency, S* &gt; Kuwait, 24th ^ay # 1941. My dear Prior, May I refer you to Galloway^s demi-official letter Ko. 122/1/G of the 19th May, 1941, to yourself? 2* In my view this convalescent camp idea must he considered very carefully and we must avoid rushing things. 3. For instance is a small camp for a few officers (say 10 to 20) visualized or a large one for Indian troops'? Scott who seems to krnow more about the project than I do (he says he discussed it with General Quinan in Basra) professes to imow that a camp for 500 men is meant. 4, As Galloway rightly says the question of food and water is the first thing that arises, hut amenities have to I he considered as well. 5. My own view is that the quarantine Buildings at Shuwaiich would he a far more suitable site than Pant as as a cool weather camp - my reasons are given below: - (a) The quarantine Building is spacious, empty and in good repair. (h) cook houses, outhouses of various kinds, servants quarters etc. are already on the spot. (c) The building has good fireplaces (a necessity in winter) and will provide good shelter from rain and storm. (d) By itself it will accommodate some 10 officers and give them a nice dining room and ante room. (e)/ The Pon*ble Lieut-Colonel C.G. Prior, CIK., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.- 2 - (e) Any over flow could 'be placed in E.P. tents in the open ground immediately west of the main 'building where green 'HABM' hushes (restful to the eye) abound and where there is a uninhabited 400* strip of ground (belonging to the Kuwait Oil Company) available along the sea shore with a depth of say 300* between the sea and the road. (f) Sea bathing is close at hand, and the old K.Q.C tennis court at Shuwailch (next door) could be made available no doubt for recreation purposes. (g) Drinking water might be laid on from the large K.O.C water storage tanks at Shuwaikh (by arrange ment of course) otherwise by dhow and hand pump. (h) The K.O.C telephone to Shuwaikh from the town passes close by, and could be tapped, and an engine house is ready to hand if it were desired to give the convalescents electric light. (i) Two good landing jetties (one K.O.C) are available in the vicinity. (j) Last but not least Kuwait town is very handy for the purchase of all bazaar supplies, and the other amenities of life which convalescents may require, and the building is close to, and on the direct route to Basra. 6. Should a large camp be visualized as Scott has suggested is the case, then the actual Quarantine building could be used as a headquarter for doctors and nurses with accommodation for say ten sick persons while the rest of the camp area could be tents. 7, The objections to Pantas are as follows: (a) The road from Kuwait is very bad and in parts impassable after rain. (b) Large numbers of Shaikhs and leading lights of Kuwait/* -3- ® &amp; Kuwait have houses and country residences strung out along the sea from Kuwait to within a mile or so of Kantas and these will not welcome the scheme or the traffic required to keep a convalescent camp going, passing continually hy their front doors. (c) Amenities are nil, though there is 'bathing. (d) Kuwait town is 15 miles away. (e) Water would he difficult in stormy weather. (f) The question of hazaar supplies would he awkward. (g) The journey to and from Basra would he much longer 8. I have purposely said nothing of the Political difficul ties - hut T do not think that the Shaikh would he as likely to raise objections to a small number of British officers convalescents occupying quarantine Buildings, as he would do if they were at Fantas. A camp for 500 convalescentsoldiers would he quite a different proposition. But if it were a case of must , he certainly would prefer them to he round about the Quarantine building and near the K.O.C Shuwaikh property, than down the coast. 9. As far as climate is concerned, there is nothing to choose between Shuwaikh and Fantas in the cold weather months - in summer Fantas is cooler definitely. I am sending a copy of this to Galloway. Yours sincerely,C0NFID3HTIAL. TJI * 7 - R o o L R rom Political Agoat Kuwait. General, Basra. 299-2/15# 29th May 1941. ASSISTANCE TO aA,.DUK SHAIKHS - A' Reference your telegram No. 116/1/9/203 da tee I6tli May 1941 (delayed several days In transEisslon). 1. Beyond offering loyalty and service, the saadun representative who visited me made no concrete proposals - and as I could not suggest anything to him at this end without knowing His Majesty's Government's policy, I sent him on to Major Galloway in Basra with a letter. 2 * ^ own private view is that we should try and get over to our side all the Saadun shaikhs on the Euphrates (there are some 60 of them who might be useful) by sending a reliable person or persons amongst them and persuading them gradually to visit /General/ s General Headquarters In Basra. Having acme in Major Galloway ©ould no doubt give them the necessary presents, register their names, and promise a monthly subsidy ranging from Rs. 300/-* per month down to Rs. 50/- according to the importance of the individual if they worked on ©ur behalf. 3« Shaikh Farhan al Bahama (Khan sahib) till recently employed by Sir J. Ward in the Fort (on the labour side) knows the Saadun well and might be just the person to make contact with them# One Mohomed al Shaikh Jabir is another who might also help. He used to work for me on the Euphrates 25 years ago. I believe Squadron Leader Smbling of the Royal Air jToroe knows where he resides. He is not however entirely to be trusted though clever. 4# Having got a list of our saadun, the natural leaders of whom on the right bank of the Euphrates (about Nasriyeh and Suq esh Shuyukh) are Thauir -e,; as daaflun . Yusuf Beg al Mansur , and Baud Beg al saadun . you could decide whether you wanted them to keep the countryside quiet, or stif up trouble on our behalf - in other words Major Galloway could give them definite jobs. 5# Abdulla Beg al Falah Pasha a resident of Basra for the most part, as head of the Saadun groups between Euphrates and Tigris, might be left alone for the moment, as he probably would be disinclined to work for us, but Ibrahim Beg ibn Mizaal Pasha, also of Basra could give us much assistance of an advisory nature if Major Galloway has not already consulted him. He always was very pro- British. Of course the best of all men to have on our side in Iraq today would be Ajaimi Pasha al Saadun. He is head /and3. and shoulders above the rest. 3. In my view however we shall make little progress with the Sa&amp;dun or any other influential body of Arabs in Southern Iraq unless we are prepared to make a declaration of Policy ©f a nature to give oonfidense, and remove the inherent fear of reprisals from any subsequent Government that may be set up in Baghdad. in It must be remembered that/the Great War all the Saadun except Ajaimi P&amp;sha, came over to our side and helped t to keep the Muntafikjbribes quiet. Again in the rebellion of 1981, the Seadun remained staunch, and the Muntafik did not move. What was the result ? After Iraq got her independence and the British went the fact that the saadun played up to the British on two notable occasions within 10 years, and were never ashamed to declare their pro-British feelings, was never forgotten for one moment by successive Arab Governments and the many anti-British Baghdad politicians who came into power at different times. Even the late King Faisal was determined to break them for what he thought their non- nationalistio attitude. The Saadun were marked down for persecution of the harshest kind, obviously in order t© break them, of their pro-British sentiments. Any Muntafik tribal Shaikhs also, who were influenced by the Saadun attitude suffered the same fate. Confiscation of property, in order to induce poverty and so loss of influence, was the common method employed and has gone on for the last 20 years now. We have therefore today somehow got to put it 1 across the Saadun and other great tribes of the Euphrates that we are not going to let them down again. 7. While therefore it is not for me to suggest what British policy should be; twenty years of the closest touch with the Saadun and the Muntafik convinces me today, that we must do something to make them believe in us, otherwise /we4. we shall make no progress. 8. My private opinion is that we should today and now issue a notification declaring that the Basra vilayet (Triangle Basra-Amara-Nasriyeh) will never again form part of the Kingdom of Iraq., and will remain under some form of direct or indirect British control. By such declaration we shall bring over to our side thousands of Arabs who must of necessity sit on the fence today, or even pose as being hostile for safety reasons, but above all we shall have a perpetual insurance that the Iraq state north of our triangle behaves itself for the future where Great Britain is c once rued. 9. It is almost an axiom among Arabs that the hostility which we have seen in Iraq and which has steadily increased in the last 20 years has been brought about by having let our friends down in the past.

Public opinion in Iraq, as in all countries without intellectual habits, depends on public feeling, and the de facto Oovemuient did everything they could think of t© *&gt;lsy on the emotions of the people. By impassioned harangues broadcast in every coffee-shop, by poems, speeches and aeruiona, by aiartlal music and processions of youth they strove to stir up a patriotic and religious fervour for tht; struggle upon which they had embarked end to embitter the hearts of the people against Great Britain. I do not yet know to what extent they succeeded elsewhere, but in Bagdad they aroused popular excitement and enthusiasm to a high pitch. In such ciiM&amp;UBJStanocs the safety of the British lives under isy care in the Embassy was a grave anxiety. A few rifles, s supply of au^mnition and a small quantity of tear-gas bombs had been collected in the Chancery and under the direction of ^ajor-General Weterhouae and two officers of the British Military mission these arms were distributed and the defence of the building organised. With these limited resources It was hoped that it would be possible to beat off any sudden attempt that might be sade by a rabble to break into the promisee but it was of course clear that a few untrained men with riflee could not hope to defend the Embassy against an organised attack, whether by Iraqi armed forces or by semi- organised civilian insurgents like the palest ini an Mujahidin. 19. Our first line of defence was the police, of whom about twenty had been posted at our gates* Oar own emergency defences could not be expected to held out for long, if the police failed* Apart from thia dependence on the de facto authorities for protection wc were also dependent on them for electricity, water and a 11 food and medical supplies* The reserves of food which had been collected in the Embassy were soon reduced to a dangerously low level and the large daily deliveries of fresh food ani other auppliea needed to maintain in health the three hundred and fifty men, women and children of several different races who took refuge in my house could only be obtained through the good will ani good offices of the authorities. I was obliged,there- fore, to be more circumspect in wy dealings with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs than I should have been had I been responsible only for the safety and welfare of a small official staff* I naturally assume full responsibility for every decision which X took, but I would add that 1 carefully considered each question aa it arose in conaultatlcn with the senior members of my staff and with senior officials aueh as General Waterhouse, the Head of the British Military Mission, and Mr* Sdaonds f Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior. We were and s till are of the op ini an that during the first two days the fate of the Embassy an of those living in it hung in the balance ana that the Iraqi authorities, deceived by their— 6 — i l0 t 1 \ / ' their apparent sueeeaet were prepared to proceed to any lengtua in the enforceroent of their demands* We were dealing not with a properly constituted government which* even though hostile* could he relied upon to observe the recognised procedure of inter* national law* hut with a number of desperate men in league with the Axis Powers* The fast that sueeessful operations round Habbanlya and the bombing of the mill tar/ camps near Bagdad later indueed the authorities to adopt a more moderate tone has not oauaed ue to modify our opinion* My aequieseence in oertain of the Iraqi demands referred to in the following paragraphs must necessarily be viewed la the light of the situation which has just been described. 80* In view of the danger of the situation* on May 2nd I gave instructions for all secret archives and most cyphers to be burnt* 1 am sending a separate despatch giving details of the eyphere and other doeumente so destroyed* 81* hate in the evening (May Pad) 1 received a note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanding the dismantling of the wlreleee transmitter end receiver which up to that time had been in use in the Btrobasay. Apart from the rights of Hie Majesty* e Government under Article 8 of the Annexure to the Anglo~Ir&amp;ql Treaty * and in this case the wire lees apparatus was manned by Hoyal Air Force personnel for the maintenance of wireless communication between the Air Officer Commanding and Hia Majesty*e JBmbasey * I was very doubtful whether I could in any circumstances claim a right in International law to use a wireless apparatus* particularly as British forces were then fighting the forces of the de faeto Government. The latter could justly: assume that the apparatus would be used for military purposes and the Iraqi military authorities would be more than likely to back up their demand by fores* X was most anxious that Iraqi forees should not enter the Bmbaeey precincts and thus have the opportunity of remaining there permanently. In any ease the wireless apparatus could not be worked without the continued supply of electric current which was under the control of the local authorities. In the circumstances I felt obliged to yield. In replying to the Ministry^ note I pointed out, however* that their demand was a contravention of the Anglo* Iraqi Treaty and I disclaimed all responsibility for the consequences which might ensue from compliance therewith* unless at the same time the Iraqi authorities granted faeilitiee for the prompt despatch of telegrams from the Bmbaasy to all destinations* through the Central Telegraph Office. 22. The next day the Ministry sent a second note on this subject informing me that it had been decided to confiscate all wlreleee apparatus in the use of foreign diplomatic missions and asking me to surrender the apparatus which had been erected in the Embassy. At the same time I was Informed that the Ministry were prepared to accept from the Mmbaeey en clair telegrams for transmission from the telegraph office. As the transmitter and receiver had already been dlemantled* I decided not to resist t is second demand* and was prepared to hand over the apparatus to the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affaire and Ministry of Defence who had some to take delivery. The representatives were not eontent* however* with surrender, but insistedInsisted eat searehlB* the Chanoery talldlnge. 1 under the strongest protest end ealaed the opportunity to pre fer the restoration of dome a tie else trie our rent which h*d in the meanwhllo been completely cut off, thereby endangering the health of the large number of people living in the house iQ a chancery.

Later in the day a further demand ms sent to me to allow renreeentatlwea of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ef tas ^ Ministry of Defence to search not only the chancery building, but also every room in the Smbaeey house and satisfy themselves there was no other apparatus in our possession. In spite of this further flagrant infraction of diplomatic iawsunity from search, I had no othar alternative hut to accept the demand under strong protest* Another small transmitter set which was not in uae was discovered, and with my consent removed* 24* On tha same day the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent yet another note stating that the flying of the British flag over the gmbassy at a time when Britain was waging war on Iraq would increase public excitement and, it was feared, provoke &amp; regrettable incident* The Ministry, therefore, asked that the flag should not be flown* The position was not wholly free from doubt* I was advised that it could not necessarily be claimed that foreign diplomatic missions have a prescriptive right to fly taeir national flag daily over the buildings which they occupy* The usual euatctt was for missions te fly the flag only on their own national days or on the national days of the countries of residence* In Bagdad for some reason, possibly dating from Ugh aoraalssiom days* a departure had betm nfmde from this custom and the mbaeey and all Foreign Legations were In the habit of flying their flags daily throughout the year* To depart from this custom was a grave step, but I felt that in the special circumstances there might be acme justification in the Iraqi Hovensiaent's contention that the flying of the Union Jack in t e heart of the Capital at that momant was provocative and would render more difficult the authorities' task of protecting the Embassy from danger of a mob attack* 1 felt also that there was every prospect that the authorities might themselves incite such an attack or send In an armed party to resnova tha flag themselves* 1 decided, therefore, unobtrusively to remove the Union Jack from the flag-staff on the reef of the Embassy, where it ordinarily flies, and to hoist it from a staff in the grounds where it would not be visible outside* 23. Another incident which marked the day waa a request mad# orally by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the British Managers of the Imperial Back of Iran and the western Bank, who were both In tha Embassy, should be asked to hand over their keys to the Iraqi authorities* The Mialatry stated that tha British Manager of the Ottoman Bank (who had taken refuge in the American Legation) had agreed to hand over the keys of his bank on condition that tha Managers of the two other Banks also agreed to do so* If the Managers refused to hand over their keys the authorities would open the banks by fores* After consulting with myself and the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, the two managersmmsm u m -s- t managers In the gnftaasy deoided to authorlea their rapraaontativaa In to* United States legation to hand over their keys under protest In the fees of * fores me jeure* • Whether the surrender of the keys actually took place 1 was unaware, ae no contact existed between His Majesty's Embassy and the United States Legation* Details of the manner in whioh this astion was taken and of the situation of the banks under the control of Rashid All's administration will be reported in a separate despatch* £6. May 4th was a second eventful day* In the early morning Wellington bombers were seen from trie embassy dropping leaflets over tae city. Shortly afterwards an official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telephoned to tell a member of my staff that the as leaflets contained a threat that the Government offices in Bagdad would be bombed# unless the Iraqi forces were withdrawn from Habbaaiya within four hours* The official said that he had been Instructed to inform tee Embassy that trie Iraqi forses would not be withdrawn and that# if the Government offices in Bagdad were bombed# tas Iraqi Air Force would retaliate by bombing all plaees inhabited by the British* This# of course# was tantamount to a threat to bomb His Majesty's Embassy and the United States Legation where so many British subjects were congregated and constitutes a further example of tbs flagrant disregard by the Iraqi authorities of international law and custom* This message was afterwards confirmed In a note from the Ministry* F7• The threat made in these leaflets came as a surprise# for I had understood that all ideas of bombing other than military targets had been dropped* 1 had already made it clear by telegram to the British military authorities on May 1st that I was strongly opposed to such action* As X saw it# the bombing of the Government offices would have united publle opinion throughout Iraq agSinst ue and aroused the fury of the Bagdad mob without in - MF way altering the military situation at Habbaaiya. I therefore addressed an urgent telegram to tbs Air Officer Commanding Middle East# the Air Officer Commanding Habbanlye and the General Officer Commanding Beers recalling my opinion that the bombing of civilians was undesirable* This telegram was sent off an clalr through the Iraqi civil telegraph office* MB* Hardly had this astion been taken before a polios Inspector arrived at the Embassy gates with a note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking that all Iraqi subjects within the Embassy should be expelled and handed over to the Inspector in charge of the police guard* It may have been that the Iraqi authorities wars anxious to withdraw Iraqis from the danger sons of the British Embassy in case it were to be bombed but I feared that the underlying purpose of thic request was to get hold of all the Iraqi servanta and to vietlmisa them for having served the British and X decided to reject it* A member of my staff discussed the matter with the Ministry by telephone# making my attitude clear# and was then informed that the reason for the request was that the wives of some men employed in the Smbassy had petitioned the Ministry alleging that their menfolk were being forcibly detained and asking for their release* ’$hen it was explained that all Iraqis were free to lesvs, if they wished to do so# the Ministry were satisfied with a list of their names. X hare a feeling# however# that the demand would have been pressed# had it not been for the timely bombing of the military camps near Bagdad that morning* 29* The next event was the unexpected arrival of Monsieur Us turn# my Turkish colleague* He cams to acquaint ms with -V*with hia Oavarwaant' a of far of good offioao to find of tha dispute batwaaa Opaat Britain and Iraq. &lt;; also ttiat ha had i»a«n inritad By tha Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affaire to aoggeat Vat it waa desirable that the aotionthraatenodln tilt leaflets dropped earlier In the morning should at all agents be postponed eo as to enable the Turkish offer to be considered In a favourable atmosphere. I showed him a copy of my telegram about bombing civiliana but explained t mt as X was cut off from all confidential contaunication with my own Government I was unable to expreaa to them my views concerning the Turkish Government s offer. This visit, however, gave me the opportunity of explaining to II* Ustutt the various humiliations to which His Majesty's Embassy was being subjected with the request that hie Government eboul- be fully informed. Forty-eight hours later M. Ustun paid me another visit complaining that he was unable to withdraw certain funds from the Ottoman isnk. ie said that he had seen the Iraqi Minister, who had given him permission to visit me with the suggestion that the British Bank Hanagera should resume their functions under safe conduct and that His Majesty's Government should provide sufficient funds to meet the liabilities of the British banks* I informed M. Ustun that X was not in touch with my Government and that if he desired any action taken the Turkish Government should raise ths matter in London. 14. Ustun confirmed to me that he had acted on the request /Bade to him by me at the coneluslon of our previous meeting. BO. The next day, May 5th, passed quietly but in the evening the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again became active. They began with a telephone message infonsing ms that ths Iraqi authorities were willing to remove all British and Iraqi women and children from the danger zone at Ttabbanlya and asking for a list of names. I sent a reply explaining that the Air Officer OotsBunding at Fiabb&amp;alya was responsible for the women and children in his cantonment and that any decision regarding them must rest with him* X suggested, therefore, that ths Commander of the Iraqi troops In the vicinity should be instructed to c&amp;mmmi^ate the Iraqi Government's offer to the Air Officer Commanding direct. At the same time I addressed an en clair telegram to the Air Officer Commanding informing him of the offer and leaving the reply entirely to hie discretion. Two days later he sent a message by aeroplane telling me that having fcreed the enemy to retire he had been able to arrange to send the women and children to Basra by air without the need for Iraqi oo-operaticax. 31. The next stop on the part of ths Ministry of Foreign Affairs was to send a note stating that the Iraqi Government had decided to establish control over the property of foreigners end to take over all the motor-cars within ths Embassy exeept those belonging to members of tm diplomatic staff. The Ministry asked that all these motor-cars should be handed over at ones to offlelele who had been sent to take them any. X decided to resist this demand to the utmost limit and in my reply I asked to be informed under What law the decision in question had been taken, warned the Ministry that, if control wau established over British property In Iraq, rile Majesty's Government In ths United Kingdom would certainly take similar action against the property of Iraqi subjects in all territories under British rule, and finally pointed out that the demand a&amp;de for tre sux^render of property located within the precineta of the Bmbasey was a direct violationviolation of Intematlonal law. I a® to «ay that I heard nothing more of thie propoaal. 52. Axkotii&amp;w note received from the Wiaietry late on Mar &amp;th asloed for a list of the aamea of all p* raons In the rnoati y of whatever nationality accompanied by a certificate taat it wae oamplete and an assurance that no one would be allowed to leave before the consent of the Iraqi authoritiee *' ‘ been obtained. i replied asking to be Informed of the purpose for which such a list was re tired, explained that ail who were f» the hinbaaay had come voluntarily on ray advice, and gave an assurance that so long as a state of emergency lasted I would, within the limits of ray authority, continue to advise all concerned not to go outalue the embassy grounds. There wee, of course, no desire on the part of anyone to do so. This reply tteertm to have satisfied the Ministry who did not again address me on this subject. 55 . After th# first few days, thsnks largely to the help of the Protocol department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a regular and sufficient supply of food began to be delivered daily and the efficient arrangements made by voluntary workers made it possible for adequate though simple meals to be provided to all those who had been gathered within the Embassy. Kecessary medical stores were also obtained In the same manner. There were fortunately a number of doctors and nursing sisters among our community and with their help the sick were looked after and sanitary aerviees organised to prevent epidemics. Owing to the efficient measures whleh were taken, the health of the community was throughout remarkably good. I should here like to pay a tribute to the civilian members of the ©cmrrainity who under the direction of the Military Mission were responsible for plaelng the ?o»bacsy in a state of defence and for providing the necessary guards and patrols both by day end night. 54. Tii# i'ress Attache r s staff distributed frequent news bulletins from material picked up from broadcasting stations and a variety of entertainments and other distractions were organised to combat boredom. The spirit shown by the British community was altogether admirable. 55. I have maae no mention of the British aircraft which passed daily over Bagdad for *eou#tlng and demonstration purposes to drop pamphlets or to bomb military targets in the neighbourhood. There is no doubt that this air action had a very salutary effect not only on the Iraqi authorities but also on the population of Bagdad which might otherwise have got out of hand and constituted a serious menace to the British coasnunlty. 55. The week between May 6 th and May 15 th pee sod without noteworthy incident except for an oral request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for permission to take away the forty-line private internal telephone exonange which the Telegraph iepartnent had put into the Embassy only a fsw days earlier* It was represented that tills was urgently needed elsewhere and I consented to its removal on eondition that it should be replaced by another which would be adequate to ensure the mlntensnce of telephone comraunication inside the Kmbassy premises. Ky condition was accepted and the exchange amicably carried out. 57. Late In the evening of May 18th X received * noteIX /■s U from the Ministry of Foroiga Affairs stating that they had learnt that Iraqi prisoners of war w#re being kept at tlabbaniya and asking that* In aeoordanoe with international practice, they should be removed to places of safety. They added that if this were not done the Iraqi authorities would be obliged to aot in a similar manner. I sent to the Ministry of Foreign Aifairs, for transmission to you, an en clair telegram euromarislng this note and Infortasd them that as I was denied the right to send cypher telegrans 1 could take no further action in the matter. The information Contained in your telegram No. 467 of May 20th that Iraqi captives would be removed from the Koyal Air Force cantonment as coon as possible wee communicated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 23rd. 58. Between May 15th and #ay 20th the Ministry of Foreign ^ Affairs ware again active. On May 16th they asked me to convey a protest to Hla Majesty's Government against the bombing of a Military Hospital at Fallujah on May 3rd, and the bombing of military ambulances on Msy l£th and 13th. They gave warning that the continuance of such attacks would 'absolve the Iraqi forces from all responsibility if they acted in a similar manner'. A second Note protesting against the machine-gunning of a motor ambul&amp;nce on Kay 13th was delivered to me on May 19th. The purport of these notes was sent to you in my telegram* Noe. 448 and 433. Air headquarters, in commenting on these allegations, admitted that s stiek of bombs aimed at another target had fallen into Fallujah, but denied that ambulances had ever intentionally been attacked. They pointed out, on the othfr hand, that Iraqi shells had hit three churches in Eabbaniya and had also fallen in tne hospital grounds. Moreover, on May 16th, six German aircraft had deliberately machine-gunned two British ambulancee clearly marked with the rted Oroee. 59. The next day it seemed possible that the demand made earlier for the expulsion of Iraqi servants from the tobasay precincts would be revived (see paragraph 28)* The Head of the Protocol Department telephoned in the morning to say that in view of the Iraqi Government's proclamation of the day before, the authorities desired all Iraqis remaining in the ^nbasay to leave at once. He added an assurance that no harm would be done to them. X assumed that he was referring to a proclamation which had be*n referred to in the bulletins broadcast by the Bagdad Radio Station, warning all Iraqis in the service of the British Government that, unless they left their posts within seven days, they would be condemned to death and their property v-ould be confiscated. I did not, however, know the full text of this proclamation nor was it clear to me that it was necessarily intended to apply to Iraqi servants in the Embassy. dC. I accordingly caused a seml-efflel&amp;l reply to be sent to this message pointing out that it wae contrary to accepted diplomatic practice that pressure of any kind should be brought to bear to compel the servants of a diploma tic mission to leave its service and that, if a proclamation h^d been made requiring Iraqis to leave the service of a foreign government, it could not properly be applied to the employees of ® diplomatic mission. The reply also asked that, if the Iraqi authorities decided to proceed further with the matter, I should be furnished with the text of the proclamation to which reference had b en made and I gave warning that, if the demand for the expulsion of the Embassy's Iraqi- 18 - Iraol aorvanta were preased, Hla t'ajeaty'e fjpvemment would no doubt take similar action against all XraQi diploma tie raisaioriB erd consulates in territorieo under tJicir control* 41 . May 18th puased quietly but on May 19th In addition to the second protect against the n^ehine-:r u nning of a military ambulance on road Fallujah - Bagdad which I have already mentioned, I received a note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs etatirig (a) t)iat on May 18th a British aircraft hod dropped ijaraphleta on Fallu^ah threatening the inhabitants that tha tovna would U© bombed o^ing to the location of Iraqi troops in that area, and (i&gt;) that in the opinion of the Iraqi C&amp;vernraent the bomoing of towns was a reprehensible aot contrary to International treaticsw The note ended with the warning that, if the British military autuoritiea killed Iraqi civilians, reprisals must be expected against the British civiliana in various cities in Iraq. Without in any way consulting dia Majesty's ilovensaant on wnom the final decision rested, I explained to the Ministry that, if there was strong presumption that Iraqi troops were located in Fallujah, it would be quits legitimate for British aeroplanes to bomb it and that the wilful bombing of, or other reprisals against, British civilians in their present situation in Iraq would b&lt;* an outrage which would no doubt lead to the strongest counter-action by His Majesty 1 s Govcruaieat* If on the other hand fsliujah were an open town, Iraqi trodps would have to be withdrawn and a declaration to that effect made by the Iraqi Oovernment* oba the following day I learnt from the British Broadcasting Corporation that, oafore my reply was delivered to the Ministry, British forces had occupied y&amp;lluj&amp;h. 42. On May gist I received through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs your telegram Mo. 577 in which, with reference to the Iraqi Mote mentioned above, you instructed me to inform the Iraqi ^ authorities that His Majesty's Forces riad so far scrupulously abstained from bombing any but military objectives in Iraq and to warn them that, if4ny acts of violence were committed against British subjects, 'such crimes would meet with drastic retribution. In their comment the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that they had already made it clear that the Iraqi authorities would regard the bombing by British aircraft of non-military targets and the consequent shedding of innocent blood as a violation of international law and that in such circumstances reprisals could not be regarded as unjustifiable! responsibility for tne result of such reprisals would, they naainteined, devolve on the party which had provoked them. They also protested against the machine-gun attacks whicn, they alleged, British aircraft had made on peaceful civilians with fatal results. 45. In acting on the instructions contained in your telegraM, I drew particular attention to the unusual action of the Ministry in offering observations on a telegram ad&amp;reaoed to tne imbaesy before its contents had been communicated to me officially. 44 . on the auMa day, the Minis try# pro tea ted against the bombing by British aircraft of quarters of Stfosul inaabited by civilians and the resulting death of thirty-two person* and the woundin^ of twenty-six, of whom the majority were old u^n, women and children. This protest was repeated to you in my telegram Mo. 456. 45'-I s* 45. On May 26th, tfc* Ministry aomplzim* **% &amp;***•, «• *«?•* works, snA s nsw aerial mast had bean set up in the embassy grounda. They declared that all euoh aetiritles were contrary to International oustom, and demanded that the ereeUone .ould ixmaadlately be taken down and that an aaaurance ehoul^ oe given that they would not be put up again* In my reply, after reoalling ^ the feet that the immunltlee enjoyed by a diplomatic Agent covered hie residence, and that 1 therefore had unfettewd ^ whatever structural alteration or additions I might think aeess^ary to the Embassy, I explained that the work on wire fencing facing and in the vicinity of the river had been started by my predecessor to keep out cate and trespassers, that no aerials had been put up on the roof since May 3rd men, in blatant contravention of inter* national law and in apita of the strongest protest, an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affaire, aeeompanled by experts, had searonsd the Embassy end satisfied himself that there no longer existed any aerials for wlrelsss transmittsr sets. Further, I ms able to explain that what was regarded by the Iraqi authorities as s newly cone trusted strong point wee only in fact a corrugated iron shelter for shower-baths, the demand contained in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs* Mots and the arguments sdduoed in support thereof were so fatuous that I can only presume that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were once more acting as s post office for tho complaints of the military authorities Who, as s matter of fact, had fbr eome unexplained reason taken over the protection of the Imhasey from the police for twenty-four hours at about that tima. 46. After this 1 received no mors tiresome notes from ths Ministry and each day artillery fire and bomb explosions sounded nearer and B.B.C. broadcasts announeed the approaeh of our troops, we also learnt that pamphlets had been dropped announcing that the Regent would soon return to the Capital. 47. On May 30th the Lord Mayor of Bagdad, Arahad Beg el Omari, telephoned to tell me that the Sharif sharaf, Rashid All, his Cabinet and the four military commanders who had supported him, the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem and come thirty to forty other adherents of the short-lived rebel government had fled the country, and that he, with the Direetor-aeneral of Police, a senior Army of floor who had had nothing to do with Hashid All and his friends, and the Direetor-aeaeral of Irrigation, had sot up a Committee of Internal security to maintain order until the Regent could return end form a constitutional government* the Lord Mayor said that ho wished to eeo me as soon as posslbl# and suggested that I should attend s meeting of the heads of foreign diploma tie missions which, with s view to stopping ths fighting, ha had called at ths Municipal Offices. I excused myself sad asked the Counsellor to attend instead. The latter pointed out that no progress could be made unless full telephone, telegraph and wireless feci11ties were immediately restored to Mis Majesty’s Embassy. Instructions were at once given and the Royal Air Foreo wirelese transmitter wee returned within half an hour. Apart from this noth***} occurred at the meeting which deserves record end shortly after 4 o'clock in the afternoon the Counsellor brought Arahad Beg and the newly appointed Acting Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant-Colonel Muruddin Mahmud, to eee m at the Imbaeay. 48. They asked for an armistice to enable the Regent to return end set up s constitutional government and X accordingly communicated their request to the General Officer Commanding by wireless telegram. In the meantime, however, British air and ground-14- ground fcreee aould bo hoard attaoklag tho Iraqi pooltl»n» on tho outoklrta and., as darkaooa same, tho Lor« Mayor telephoned urgently to aak that arrangowenta might bo made to aend out an Ira^i party with a white flag to arrange an liuedlate loeal auopenalon of hootilltloa, until the appeal for a general armlatlee had been considered.

The Right Honourable v* Anthens Bden 9 u«J#, ^ *,fte(&gt; Ko* 19 , (285/3/42) British Embassy, Bagdad. 24th January, 1942 Sir, Parliament reassembled on January 17th after an adjournment of six weeks. At the first two meetings no business was done as a quorum was not present. The recess has passed quietly, and the principal matters of concern has been the cost of living, the trial of Rashid Ali and his associates, the interpretation of certain Articles of the organic Law and the review of Iraq’s position in the war. 2. prices of essential articles show little improvement. Maximum prices for matches, tea, coffee, sugar, wheat and barley and certain grades of cotton goods have been fixed by the central supply B 0 ard but merchants are generally selling only low quality stocks at the fixed prices. T^e better quality is obtainable at a hi^ier price by private arrangements. The price of the best quality wheat was fixed early in January at.l«D.4o a ton and the lowest quality (with 15^ of dirt) at i.d* 34. The ('Hi*.) price of flour has however remained uncontrolled and has V now exceeded I»d* 3 per loo kilos. This is a very high price for the poor to pay. m Bagdad the Mayor endeavoured to organise the sale of restricted quantities at a lower price. He was obliged however to give up the experiment as he found that without rationing it was impossible to prevent abuses. He is now trying to organise adequate supplies of controlled price bread instead, but is confronted with the difficulty of having a stock of wheat only big enou#i to last until the end of February. A British expert is now helping the Iraqi authorities to solve their supply and distribution problems but so far as can be judged from the available information it will be impossible to find enough grain to feed the people in the towns unless a large quantity can be imported from abroad. such supplies can only be obtained tfehough the good offices of His Majesty’s Government and I have in several telegrams represented to you, sir, the gravity of the situation which will arise if wheat is not speedily made available for this country. The people in villages and settled tribal areas have generally speaking en 2 u s£ foodstuffs to keep them alive until the next harvest, but in the towns there are thousands of families who had not money enou#i to lay in supplies in advance for the winter and TH3 RIGHT HONOURABLE ANTHONY EDEN* M.C«, '• &gt; ETC •, BTC* t ETC.■■■■■■ MHi ✓- ■■Hi and who ar® dependant for their deiljr brand on sensll pnrolmaea. The ateody rise in the price of florcr and all other foodstuffs has hit these people hard and if adequate supplies within their means fail they will be faced with atarnation* 4* The result of the trial by oorrt mertial of Raahid Ali and hie aesociatee wat* pnbliehed on January 3th* Raahid Ali, All Mahawd el shaikh All# Ynnle 3abawi, Balahwd Din Sabbath, ^ahrai Said and Mahmud Salman were auntenoed to be hanged# min aki woe also sentenced to death but the sentence was comnuted to life inpi^isonraent* Kaj 1 hsulcat was sentenced to 15 years 1 imprieondtfd^r, rlC(’iq hanshsl to 5 years ’ imprisonment and !.'rhaBKnad Haean Belman to one year’s impriaon#mr* ’he Court ^Iso ornerfd the c rifle-cation of the property of all the above-mentioned persone. ^h© Court further decided to postpone the hearing of the chargee nade against l«eji Suwaidi, Moh©T.med All Mahmud, Musa Shahbandar, R»nf hahreni, Kamil Bhabib and Abdul aflir silani until such time as they should be «b^ le to appear before the Court, the court having been satisfied that these peraons had wished to respond to the (iourt’s sum ona to sur ender themselves for trial but had been prevented fro a doing so by circuitsrices outside their control* 3 # As you are aware, the actual po&amp;ition of the accused persons is that Rashid Ali is in Berlin, i Bhaukat and Muhammad Hasean Salman are in Vrfcey, while the remainder \ith the exception of falahud fin ^abb&amp;gh, whose whereabouts are unknown, are on their way to Southern Rhodesla for Internment. 6 . On January 2r th the Iriqi Governramt oiade a formal written application for the surrender of all of the above- mentioned persons who are now in the hands of Hie Majesty’s Government (except Abdul ; adir Gailani, who la charged with a minor of ence). The prime Minister informed me orally that the Cabinet resolution to taxe this step had been paseau unanimously and that it had at the same time been resolved th&amp;t if any of these men were acquitted after their return to Iraq they should be interned at ao* 7. The -rime Minister confessed to me privately however that he was doubtfh 1 of the wisdom of giving full effect at once to the Cabinet *n resolution and I agreed with his view that it would be better to have beck firfct those who# had been sentenced and to let the others come later on if the situation continued to be favourable* I h£ve, thei^efore, aa you are already aware from my telegram ??o. 70 , proposed that Ali Mahmud al Shaikh All, Tunis Habawi, Amin Saki Snlaiman, Fahmi Suid, Ms brand Balman and Biddiq Ch&amp;nshal shall be surrendered cs soon as posplble while the otheisare detained for a while in South Africa. 8 . Since the announcement of the aentences I have made careful enquiries throughout the country Into the state of public feeling regarding the handing over of the convicted men and the execution of their eentencee. T ©ports show that there has been a considerable hardening of opinion against the&amp;e men during the last month and thst no serious trouble is expeotrd as the ruault of such action,.3 9# in paragraph 10 of my despatch No* 349 of December 14th I mentioned the Prime Minister’s declared wish to strengthen the authority of parliament. Drring the recent parliamentary recess he hae been examining possibilities of doing this within the framework of the Organic Law* The High Court (consisting cf four Senators and four Judges) provided for in Article 3 of the Organic Law has been called upon to reply to the following questions touching the interpretation of Articles 20 and 22 of the Constitution. (1) Would the addition of certain rights to the established rights of the King daring the period of Regency be an infringement of the King’s prerogatives ? (2) If the male descendants in direct line to hia late Majesty the King Paisai should cease can a female descendant in the direct line become heir to the Throne ? and if not, would it be within the rights of the nation to settle this matter ? (3) Would the creation of the post of Xxtyxxr Peprty or Assistant Minister, to be held by a member of parliament, be contrary to the ConaUtction ? 10* The following decisions were given by the High Court (1) The grant of new rights to the Xing would not contravene Article 22 of the Organic Law. This articles forbids the modification of the Xing’s prerogatives during a regency* The assignment of additional rights to the King world not be a modification within the mealing of this article. (2) A female cannot succeed to the Throne and, if, which God forbid, there should be no mole heir to the Throne, the decision to be taken world rest with the nation under Article 19* (3) The creation of the post of Deputy or Assistant Minister from among members of Parliament is not lawful for it would weaken the legislative power. (The underlying idea of this somewhat ambiguous decision seems to be that if each Minister coold appoint a Deputy or Assistant the influence of the Cabinet over the Senate and the Chamber would be much increased becatuie of the powerful patronage which the Cabinet would thereby control within the two Konees. ) 11. Coeeticns concerning Articles 53, 31 and 119 of the Organic Law have also been referred to the High Court for interpretation. 12* The Organic Law itself is meanwhile being studied by a special committee with s view to the elimination, by amendment, of the defects which have been revealed by experience. The Committee consists of 12 members, ex-Ministens and Judges, under the Presidency of Jamil Ladfai* 13* Reports which have reached me from Political Advisers and other sources show that there are still too many pro-Naais and anti-British Iraqi civil officials and Army officers at large in the northern lives* Most of them appear to be inactive at present but they represent a potentially hostile element and I4 \V&lt;&gt; I shall continue to make strong representations to the Prime Minister for their removal* I am also pressing for action against a number of rndesirable teachers and officials who still remain undisturbed in the Ministry of Education and its various schools* It is impossible to deal with all those persons who showed hostility when Nazi influence was in the ascendant but in spite of the fact that too many remain untouched, there is no doubt that the general political atmosphere in the country has greatly improved* Cooperation between the British end Iraqi forces is excellent and social intercourse is encouraged by the higher command on each side* A joint Anglo-Iraqi survey of certain featiires of the desert area south of the Euphrates between Jalal w&amp;nl and Ramadi is now being carried out and the wlosul Municipality ha/e given their new Town Hall for nee as a Service club for British troops* H*. The Prime Minister has been thinking a good deal lately about Iraq’s position in the war* From the beginning he has had faith in an Allied victory and has seen cljeesrly that Iraq could expect few positive benefits from such a victory unless she played, in some measure, an active part in the fight against Nazism* While those who believed in a Nazi victory favoured re— insurance with the Reich, uri Said has always inclined towards the building up of a substantial credit account with the Allies on which xraq could cash in when the time came for peace set lements* This was the basis of his early schemes for a token Iraqi force in the western desert and though political and military oppositionnto such a project tfas too strong for him he has never given up the hope of finding some way of improving Iraq s position at the peace conference by finding a part for her to play in the war* He quickly appreciated the importance for the Arab countries (especially Iraq, Syria and Palestine; of the Atlantic Charter and more recently h*^ has seen the opportunity which is offered by the 26 paer anti-Axis Pact concluded at Washington at the beginning of the year. He has accordingly been sounding his colleagues and some of the senior politicians now out of office, with a view to obtaining their agreement to Iraq’s adherence to this Pact and the concurrent declaration of a state of war between Iraq and Italy and Germany. He no doubt feels that Iraq’s ultimate claims to the rights and privileges recognised by the Atlantic Charter will thereby be strengthened. He may also hope that if Iraq signs the Fact the Inited States of America may estend the Lease-Lend Act to her. He would like Saudi Arabia to take the same step at the same time but he is awaiting the advice of His Majesty s Govermaent before making any proposals to King Ibn Baud* 15* Iraq’s position vis-a-vis Syria has also been under consideration and as you already know the Prime Minister informed me about the middle of January that the ~raqi Government would be willing to recognise the Syrian and Lebanese Governments if the Free French autnoritiea announced that the present arrangements are only temporary and that at the end of the war the Syrian and Lebanese will be free to choose what form of government shall be set up in their respective countries* 16 The French Minister, his family and the Legation staff left Iraq at the end of December. The remainder of the iapaneseJapanese Legation staff remained pending a decision as to the ronte to be chosen for their repatriation and arrangements for the release of British diplomatists in Japanese hands* All Japanese property in Iraq was brought under official control soon after the Japanese declaration of war on the U • § • A* 17* The Iraqi Government have under consideration a draft Treaty of Friendship with China* The Prime Minister informs me that this does not involve an exchange of diplomatic missions* 16* I am sending copies of this despatch to His *s Representatives at Angora, Cairo, Tehran, Jedda, The Minister of State, Cairo, Hie Majesty f s High CoomisBioner for Jerusalem and Transjordan, the Governor-General of India, the Commander-in-Chief India, General Headquarters, Midale Hast, the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the political Agent, Koweit, and to His Majesty^ Consuls at Basra and Mosul* I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Yorr most obedient, humble Servant, i.)

Ttea two Hide-memoires with which Bhukri til was furnished amounted to little more than a re-statement of th&gt;&gt; Laudl claims and a rejection of the proposals for settlement, including neutral arbitration about the frontier, hitherto put forward by the Iraqi Governnunt. They therefore provided no ba*i* for profitable discuaeioas. ^he indisposition of th Minister for Foreign Affairs, to which I have referred above, delayed th Infernal talks which t hufcrif qiiwatll wished to 1 hiV# about these matters * nc his otay in ^agdad has accordingly b* en unexpectedly prolonged* Kaahld All*a associates the further consideration of hie plan for Iraq’s adherence to thr Washington ©nti-Axis Pact and the declaration of a state of War between Iraq and Italy and Germany.

It was pleasant to see the warmth of tht popular applause given to His Royal Highness whenever he drove through the streets of Bagdad and the rehole-hearted co-operation of the Iraqi Police and ^rioy in all arrangements connected with the Puke’s visit was as gratifying as it was significant, !4* In general* X coiisiuer that the situation in this country Has developed satisfactorlly since the date of ray last review, especially when cne considers the long series of ast-baaks suffered by our arms at the ham * of the Japanese during this period* At, the time of writing, ther?; is much speculation over the G-ertaan offensive thought to be imminent, bhoulo the main thrust be launched against the Caucasus and attain its objective, the repercussions among these volatile people will, of course, be great.

He la without doubt right to give fir*t importmict to supplies. ‘ 6 . The oovenuaent* e plans for building up stock* of wheat with which to feed* the arhan population have not yet produced the results hoped tofm The eup lies needed for the bakeries and for the sale of flour in small quantities «t a controlled price have up to the present been maintained in most places but of the reserve stock of [ one hundred thousand tons which it was ©atirj»ted w ?uld be needed to meet the demands of the towns until next harvest only about forty thousand ton* have so for been collected. The policy of compelling the owners of Isrpe stocks of whest to sell to the government *t the fixed prices, has, however, only been in operation for a little over e month and on the information available It ia not unreasonable to hope that as each month passes furtlier quantities will bs located, bought up and distributed fast enough to keep pact with current coneu option.*9* A Eiiidlar handling of &amp; number of othor essentials of life will, however, be neeesoary if the great mess of the towns people are to be saved from severe hardship during the coming winter. For a variety of reasons which it is unnecessary to discuss in this despatch the prices of all foodstuffs and consumers goods, including many things of which there is no real shortage, have been rising rapidly and the wage-earning classes are facing the oncoming winter with acute anxiety. Zn consequence, on all sides, dem&amp;ds are sk* being pressed for subetantlal wage increases and unless urgent measures are taken to peg down market prices or to ensure rationed supplies of cheap food and clothing we shall soon, 1 fear, see wages vainly mounting in pursuit of prices until inflation and economic chaos result. 10 . Coupsred with the complex systems of the industrialised countries of Nurope the national economy of Iraq is simple but the fact has to be faced that the administrative machine is woefully Inadequate to deal with current problems even in the elementary form in which they occur in this country. i*he small group of British officials who are trying to establish a working control over sup lies are now, h&lt;eever, be -inning to make some slight headway and I try to hope that before winter comes the position may have been improved. It Is nevertheless clear the the feeding, clothing and housing of the poeple is the most urgent and important problem that the Oovern^ient have to face, and X would that 1 could detect some real evidence of a robust uetermination to tackle these problems. Instead one has to fight against inertia, lack of public spirit and widespread stupidity on the part of politicians, vested interes e and the propertied classes. 11 * . hostile war propaganda ia now at a low ebb end confidence in an .llied victory steady. two important factors influencing public opinion were first, the stories brought back by Iraqi visitors to Turkey that well-informed Turkish were convinced of German defeat and secondly, .itallngrad 9 s stubborn defence in face of Germany's reckless attacks. 12. In tribal affairs the ihammar have been attracting more than usual attention during the last two months. The let# Shaikh Ajll si Yarwar built up great wealth throu^i his aotnte exploitation of the opportunities offered to him by the development of oil-fields in the northern Jazirah and by the construction of the broad-guage railway through the Shammar dire . He also cultivated influential friends in high places and through them acquired much land. This was given to him In order that he mifht settle his tribe and persuade them to give up their old habits of marauding. .hat he did, however, was to farm the land for his own profit with hired labour without attempting to settle the bedouin shammar. Hi© son Sufuk, who succeeded him after his death not long ago, has not unhappily the same strong hold over the tribe as his father and rival scions of the numerous ihsikhly house are now competing with him jealously for a share in his inherited wealth and influence. Of thesb the Aulad Faisal are the most forceful and one of their most troublesome activities has been their persistent blackmailing of the Iraqi Government and British j rmy contractors. Their practice is to demand large sums from ell contractors working in the lhammar dire on the pretext of providing local *V rotection 1 * foi* the work. Towards the end of August a quarrel flared up between tnre^ bhaikhlqi of the jiulad Faisal and a ihaikh of another branch of the -hiaikhly family as to who should enjoy the rltht of extorting money in this manner from British hrmy contractors working on certain sectors of the itosul - Tel Kotchek Hoad and a fight followed in which one ofTpr-w the Aulad Faisal and a number of the followers on each side were killed* The forces engaged were 00 large and well-armed that the Iraqi police in a nearby post were afraid to intervene and the contractors in the neighbourhood were so unnervei thst they stopped work and for some time refused to go beck to this part of the road* Owing to a lack of proper under*tending between the i-utasarrif at Mosul and the Minister of the Interior an unduly long delay occurred before this affair was deal with end it was not until October 2nd that the principal participant© were brought into ^osul anu locked up. do soon as this was done the contractors ware able to resume work but further disciplinary measures will have to be taken before the unrulineas of the Shammer is satisfactorily curbed. 13* The cognate quarrel of the diatomsr with the Yezidi shaikh Daud-i~Daud has not yet been fully settled by the Iraqi Qovemment snd peace between the two tribes is only preserved by detaining Dt»ud-1-Daud in Sulslmanlt an arrangement that cannot be prolonged indefinitely* li|# Dohuk and Amadiyah have not yet been altogether freed from the marauding bands which have intimidated the villages for so lon^t On August 25th fifteen men raided the Assyrian village of Barsangi in the Amadiyah district, brutally murdered a priest and looted his house* Only one arrest has so far been made for this crime but about forty men are now awaiting trial for other outrages com itted by these gangs* 15* During the latter part of the summer the Diwaniyah Llwa wee the eeene of e number of tribe! conflicts, the worst of which took piece on September 9th, wfefen e body of men of the Aqra tribe attacked five of the Khasail and, having killed them all, mutilated their bodies* Police intervention stopped the spread of the fighting but the temper of both tribes regains hot and their future action un certain* Their quarrel, like so many on the Euphrates, is an old one and the Aqra state that their treatment of the Kha&amp;all dead was retaliation for a similar outrage committed by &gt; ^asailis on Aqra men fire years ago* These disturbances have no major political signif icance but they show how wild and brutish the greet part of the ^ population still is and give sinister point to the reports which I ^ receive of the large number of rifle© and cartridges which the tribes in all parts of the country have secured for themselves during recent years* 16 . on the night of .^1 ust 29 tV 3 b*h the railway line near hlilah was blown up by a percussion bomb of some kind as a train was passing* Little damage was done and no casualties were caused* Those respons ible have not yet been traced and it has not yet been established what type of bomb or mine had been placed under the track. 17* In late''Cpteraber there was a serious outbreak of agrarian trouble in the Hal in the Kut Llwe* Men of the Al Aid tribe raided sheep belonging to a neighbouring 3©dun landlord who had refused them permission to psss a canal through his l*md to the river* vhen he end a relative went with two policemen to recover the sheep the tribesmen ambushed snd killed most of the party. The tribal leaders rejected s twenty-four hours* ultimatum to submit and in a fight with the police that followed the tribesmen were dispersed and are thought to have lost about eighty men killed and neriousjuwounded. The police casualties wei e eight aien killed and twenty-f^ve wounded* 18.- The Hecent went to Amman on August 31©t to visit his uncle the Ante Abdullah and remained until September 8 th.

It Is uoubtful who was to blase for the Xasultiidt .diicdi Sethis in the end to hove been usod by both Ministers in the altercation, but I suspect that it was very Much a ea«e of the pot calling the kettle black. Feace-'Cfekljif' efforts ylftldeu uo results and each btnietar iml&amp;UHX tiitat after sdiat had occurred it was Impossible for him to remain In the Cabinet with the ether. Friends and partisans rallied to each side and as one Minister is a bhla and the other a Sunni, t&gt;&gt;e quaiwl quickly chtvelopea into sceiethlng cf a sector la a tussle. For a few days it seamed that the bhi* Miuister of Firsinoe, feelih libr, the s»st important of the .Prime colit bettors, wouS.d become iisrtlved, but he showed good sense and courage enough to pwb c&lt;mnt 2 *y before faction end to stick to tl«c task he htd undertaken of fixsling a solution for Ir^ # fc economic difficulties. the Hcgent too bed a personal interest ift U»e natter and once again steed by his protege, Sahalfi All. £• fe »ae it seemed deplorable that, at a time when there are so many urgent questions of public ixitercst to be dealt with, a etoraia the tea cup like this should paralyse the administration and I lost no ©prortunity of pressing tiic Begent ar^ the Prime minister (and the Minister of Finance) to have tone with It quickly, fat over a fortnight passed before all the ssoves 1» the tortuous game were played according to convention and a settlement could be reached. This was that both Abdul Mahdi and fahslu All should leave the Cabinet, but that Tab a in , ill 9 * departure should be deferred until a place could be made for hi® at the Palace by sending the Head of the itoysl Plwan, Abbas kahdi, to lehraii as Minister.

The Council also considered a memorandum submitted by the Prime Minister No. 125 dated 11th January, 1943. In view of the hostile attitude which has been adopted for a long time by the Axis Powers against Iraq and.of the continued activities through their agents for the destruction of the legitimate Iraqi Govern ment and of the pressure brought to bear on the Iraq Parliament (as revealed in the Parliamentary Resolution adopted by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate on Uth November, 1941, and 15th November, 1941 respectively) and in view of the openly hostile action taken by them during May, 1941. And in view of the persistence of the Axis Powers in their hostile attitude from then to the present time by the attacks directed against Iraq and her interests through their broadcasting stations; and in view of their continued efforts to create differences and dissensions between the various communities of Iraq, with the object of endangering public security and public order by spreading false rumours and lying news through their Broadcasting Stations as well as by all other means avail able to them. And in view of the fact that the Broadcasting authorities of the Axis Powers openly and unceasingly use abusive expressions which are intended to impair the dignity of the Royal Family and so undermine the loyalty of the Iraqi people; and also in view of the fact that the Axis Powers encouraged those persons who defied the law and attemp ted to overthrow the Constitutional System of their country by force of arms and have, after the escape of these persons from Iraq, harboured and maintained them. And whereas the interests of Iraq in particular and of the Arab peoples in general make it imperative that Iraq should adhere to the Declaration of the United Nations signed at Washington on 2nd January, 1942, which was based on the Atlantic Charter signed by the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the 14th of August, 1941, and this in view of the lofty principles embodied in the said document, guaranteeing to all peoples, small or great, their liberties and independence, as well as their integrity. After the perusal of Article 26 (8) of the Organic Law, the Council passed the following resolution:-— (i) Iraq shall be deemed to be in a state of war with the three Axis Powers. (it) Iraq shall adhere to the Declaration of the United Nations signed at Washington on January 2nd, 1942,2 MENORANDUM SUBMITTED BY H. E. THE PRIME MINISTER, No. 125 DATED 11-1-1943 1. The principal foundations upon which any democratic state should stand may be outlined as follows:— (а) A definite system of government determining the basic institutions and powers oi the state concerned and ensuring her progress towards the realisation of her own ideals, the establishment of justice therein and the development of her vital resources in the political, administrative, constructive, economic, social and other fields, Such a system is usually ensured by an organic law which stipulates that the conduct of the affairs of the state shall be under the supervision of a parliament whose designation and composition vary with different states. (б) A head whom the people entrust with the supreme leader ship of the country and who is invested with powers enabling him to direct the policv of the state and control the proper functioning of the machine thereof in accordance with its constitution and the laws derived therefrom. (c) A force composed of all the various armed services to safe guard the integrity of the state and defend the country against any internal or external menaces. In the present age such a force is, as a general rule, supported by international re lations which ensure the safety of the state and which are reinforced by treaties and pacts whereby the state is linked with certain other sta es to whom it is drawn closer by com mon interests and conformity of aims. Recently, such international relationship has become very important not only in the case of small and new states, but also in the case of great powers no matter how large and powerful they may be, such as the allied and the axis powers which hive been interre’ated with a network of treaties all of whichaim at safeguarding the existence and ensuring the safety and interest of the state concerned. One must look forward to the gradual expansion of these international relationships as, owing to the increased complexity and development of inter national interests due to modern inventions it is quite impossible for any single state to live isolated from the rest of the world. Any impairment in the above foundations in any state will inevitably threaten the very existence of that *tate and harm her in proportion to the extent cf the defect 2. If the modern history of Iraq is carefully examined it will appear that the young Iraqi state was only founded after the last Great war, i.e the war of 1914—1918. Iraq at once commenced to consoli date gradually her three foundations, beginning with enti listing the sovereignty of the nation into the hands of the late King Faisal, I, the founder of modern Iraq and restorer of her ancient glory. Then followed the enactment of her organic law, the raising of her r.rmed forces, the delimitation of her frontiers, the conclusion of. the Treaty of Alliance between Iraq and Great .Britain whose interests coincided with the independence of Iraq, and finally her admission to the League of Nations and adherence to the covenant thereof.F'or her existence and stability during that period, Iraq was only indebted next to God, to the efforts of her sincere sons, to the Great House of Hashim and to the British Government who deemed it to be in her own interest to support the wishes of the people ot Iraq. As a matter of fact not one of all the great and small countries of the world, including those who call themselves now the Axis Powers, agreed to recognize the independence of Iraq except only through the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty which was approved and welcomed by all Arab Countiies. Even the leading personalities of Egypt, foremost among them the Egyptian Wafd Party, were unanimous in recommending the conclusion of a tieaty of alliance by Egypt with Great Britain on the same lines 3. It is exremely regrettable that, soon after the Iraqi State had been founded and stabilized, fate should make her suffer the tragic loss ot her great leader and founder King Faisal the First, just at the beginning of her new life. Eventually, she had to face many difficulties and was threatened with innumerable dangers, whereby elements of weakness crept into her constitution. As soon as the policy ot aggiession began to assert itself a few years ago by the acts of certain ambitious states, the representatives of some of those powers were allowed to seize e\er^ opportunity for aggravating that state of weakness in Iraq b\ getting into touch with certain evil elements in the country such as selfish and adventurous pei sons and encouraging their dangerous activities. The result was that the wicked intentions of those powers towards Iraq, in particular, and the Arab Countries, in general, were proved beyond all doubt in spite of their pretended sympathy for the Arab cause as expressed through their proteges, mouthpieces and sycophants In this way those powers w r ere able to take advantage of certain we iknesses in Iraq, to encourage the agents of destruction and to widen the sphere of then action, thus striking heavy blows against the very basis of the three foundations upon which she rests. If, in fact, the agents, w'ho have placed themselves at the disposal of those foreign powers w r ho are eager to devour their country, were asked to state what made them -erve those powers, they would be unable 10 justify their shameful conduct which most dangerouslv threatened the very existence and vital interests of their country. 4. Even before the present war certain aggressive powers began to carry out their abominable policy by resorting to force and invaded some countries with their armed forces. The extent of their aggression steadily increased and finally led to a declaration of war between the Axis Powers, on the one side, and Great Britain and hei Allies, On the other. The war has since so spread that it has attained its present degree of magnitude. The right policy that should have been adopted by all states,— particularly those that are small and recently created—was to denounce and resist any aggressive policy pursued by any bullying powei. Had all the states of the world combined, before the outbreak of the present war, and agreed that each one would join in opposing any armed aggression even if the state attacked was a distant one unconnected with them by special ties or interests, we should not have recently Witnessed one state after another losing their independence and becoming victims of aggression, with all the sufferings and evils4 entailed thereby, Events have proved that to be indifferent to aggression is to encourage it and to allow it to expand and spiead until in time it attains its climax. The Axis Powers who did so much harm to 'Iraq by encou raging and nourishing the elements of weakness therein have gradually put into execution their aggressive plans and have succeeded in widening the scope of their plans so that a large number of countries, such as Czechoslovakia, Poland. Yugoslavia, Greece, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Siam and even sotr-e parts of China, Russia and the possessions of the United States are now groaning under the oppressive yoke of Axis occupation. There is clear evidence of the threat of an early extension of armed aggression to other States and countries at tlie first opportunity, and among those threatened are the ‘Iraq state and other Arab countries where the Axis Powers have indul ged in secret intrigue and open propaganda for some years past. Undoubtedly most of the loyal leaders in those countries now regret their failure to resist the policy of aggression in its initial stages and realise the follv of their once cherished belief that they could save their countries from aggression by being indifferent to the aggres sive acts which, as onlookers, they saw being committed in detail against other states. Had all the victims adopted at the outset the wise policy of promptly opposing each act of aggression as it occurred, each country contributing to the full extent of her capacity, the outlook of the present world war would have now been quite a different one, and perhaps, the leaders in and promoters of this aggressive policv would not even have ventured to carry it into final effect S. The policy of armed aggression met with great success at the beginning of the war and brought destruction to all the countries which ^he powers of evil were able to enter. In 1940 the Axis victories attained their zenith materially and threatened the whole world with the evils of subjugation and destruction. The policy of treachery and destruction adopted by the Axis Powers caused a shock of terror and anxiety unprecedented in the annals of history. The world then turned towards heaven searching for a ray of hope to enlighten the dark future. During those hard times and before the United States entered the war. Mr, Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt met and announced on the 14th of August 1941, the “ Atlantic Charter” by which they expressed the common principles underlining the policy of their respective countries for the guarantee of a happy future when peace, cooperation and confidence would replace doubt, suspicion and rivalry amongst the peoples of the world. The Charter consists of eight articles, of which the second and third ones specially concern us. They read :— Second: I hey desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned. TW : Thev respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of Government under which they will live, and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them.5 These two articles enlighten the path along which the Arab Cause is advancing. They contain the cures for its complications and sound principles for the solution of its problems, as well as the means for the attainment of its ideals. Undoubtedly, these principles will continue to prevail as the American people has unanimously decided to take part in world affairs under Mr. Roosevelt’s leadership for the benefit of the American people itself, as well as for the whole world. The most important factor in shattering the belief of men in international justice and shaking the spirit of mutu-d confidence among nations after the last world war was undoubtedly the withdrawal of the Government of the United States of America from participation in the field of European Politics and their refusul to support the ideals which they had themselves promulgated and promised to ensure. This negative attitude of the American Government gave a free hand to the other victorious states, who were bound to one another by pledges from which it was not easy for them to disengage themselves. This led to a number of difficulties and serious consequences of which unfortunately some of the Arab Countries had a share. The return of the United States of America to the policy of participation in world politics will help to remove many of the difficulties that may arise from previous international pledges, especially any secret ones and will ensure international justice according to the provisions of the Atlantic Charter. It is most unlikely that the Government of the United States of America will abstain from associating herself with general international affairs at the end of the present war, for they have already witnessed with their own eyes the misfortunes and calamities which befell the world as a result of their non-interference in world affairs after the last war, as well as the horrors and sufferings of the present struggle which surpass anything that occurred during any previous war. 6. After the aggravation of the Axis aggression and the entry of the United States of America in the war. the leaders of twenty-six states representing the inhabitants of more than two-thirds of the whole civilized world met and signed in Washington the Twenty-Six Powers Pact (Commonly known as the Declaration of the United Nations) which confirms the principles embodied in the Atlantic Charter and which aims at defeating the policy of aggression. In this declaration they have left the door open for all other nations who may or will help or contribute materially in the common struggle to join with them. 7. It is evident that it is in the vital interests of Iraq (being a state bound by the Anglo - Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, as well as by the Covenant of the league of Nations, and one who carries out her in ternational obligations with all candour and sincerity) to support any policy which tends to ensure the freedom of peoples and resist aggress ion, especially when it is realized that in the fore-front of the states which back this policy stands the country which has already proved, by her actions, her friendly attitude to Iraq and shown that her interests do accord with Iraq’s independence. On the other hand, the end of the states who follow the policy of aggression in this respect has always been to obliterate the political existence of Iraq and encourage every movement started by Iraq’s enemies in and out of this country.6 It was the duty ot Iraq to stand by the side of her Aliy Great Britain and her Allies ever since the declaration of this war. But she was unable to do so as she was engaged in fighting Axis intrigues in her own country. the most obvious proof of the wicked intentions of those powers towards Iraqis what they have don- and are still doing m spreading false rumours about this country and intriguing against her, and by the continuous attacks directed by their broadcasting stations against the noble House of Hashim and by abusing every person who may be legiti mately ... power in Iraq. By all this they hope to persuade Iraq to dis avow her legal pledges contained in the Anglo - Iraqi I teat} of Alliance_ The Axis Powers act in this way when they themselves only recognized - our existence and independence through and as a result ot this Treaty of Alliance. The wicked intentions of the Axis were most evident dining the disgraceful rebellion ol May. 1941 which they not only organized and financed but also supported openly and actively Moreover the Axis Powers did their utmost to provide arms and funds to the leaders o that rebellion in order to encourage it and aggravate the damage d had already done which indeed almost destroyed the country and imperilled its verv existence. Axis officials revealed only too clearly the real interest of their Governments in the affairs of Iraq when they arrived in this eountry du ring that notorious rebellion. The first thing they did was to loot what ever produce or goods they could lay their hands on, and they sent large quantities to their countries. The Axis Powers are not content with the loss and damage they have occasioned to life and property in Iraq. They are now harbouring a number of the leaders of that rebellion and their followers who escaped from justice. These treacherous persons are being forced by the Axis to engage in propaganda against Iraq in order to obtain the very means of subsistence. All these activities are positively hostile in character. All the evidence indicates that such acts are only a cloak covering preparations for armed hostile action which the Axis will not hesitate to direct against Iraq whenever an opportunity occurs. . What the Axis have done to Iraq they also did and are still do ing to all Arab countries whom they aim at enslaving as everybody well knows. 8. It is obvious from the above that the Axis Powers have been aiming at the destruction of Iraq as a state, and that for years thev have exerted unceasing efforts to achieve this. Ever since the outbreak of war they have been openly hostile in their attitude towards this country and have actually most dangerously threatened its existence. Had it not been for the mercy of God, Iraq would have now been subjected to all the ooting, persecution and bondage which are being endured by the coun tries who have passed under the Axis yoke.7 The majority of the Chamber of Deputies expressed their desire that Iraq should adhere to the principles of the Atlantic Charter (vide President of the Chamber’s letter No. 69, dated 12th November. 1942) The adherence of Iraq to the Declaration of the United Nations will enable her to stand formally side by side with the United Nations who are struggling for the principles of freedom and justice. Moreover, such adherence will greatly assist Iraq to attain her national objectives and realise her ideals in her internal, as well as external policies. These policies have been announced on several occasions and have in view the welfare of Iraq and that of the Arab countries which are struggling to obtain their freedom and independence. Moreover, the liabilities to be borne by this country as a result of the adherence to the above Declaration are, under no circumstances, expected to be other than thos c to which she has pledged herself under the Anglo-Iraqi 1 reaty and th e Covenant of the League of Nations.\ * . 8 OFFICIAL STATEMENT. In vie of the hostile attitude which has been adopted for a long time by the Axis Powers against Iraq and of the continued activities through their agents for the destruction of the legitimate Iraqi Government and of the pressure brought to bear on the Iraq Parliament (as revealed in the Parliamentary Resolution adopted by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate on 11th November, 1941, and 15th November, 1941, respectively) and in view of the openly hostile action taken by them during May, 1941. And in view of the persistence of the Axis Powers in their hostile attitude from then to the present time by the attacks directed against Iraq and her interests through their Broadcasting Stations; and in view of their continued efforts to create differences and dissensions between the var ious communities of Iraq, with the object of endangering public secu rity and public order by spreading false rumours and lying news through their Broadcasting Stations as well as by all other means available to them. And in view of the fact that the Broadcasting authorities of the Axis Powers openly and unceasingly use abusive expressions which are intended to impair the dignity of the Royal Family and so undermine the loyalty of the Iraqi people; and also in view of the fact that the Axis Po wers encouraged those persons who defied the law and attempted to over throw the Constitutional System of their country by force of arms and have, after the escape of these persons from Iraq, harboured and main tained them. In view of what is stated above and pursuant to Article 26 (8) of the organic Law, His Highness the Regent has issued Royal Irada (Decree) No. 29 dated 13th January, 1943 , declaring a state of war be tween Iraq and the Axis Powers as from midnightof 16-17 January,1943.PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY THIRTY-TWO DEPUTIES AT THE MEETING HELD BY THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES ON 12TH NOVEMBER, 1942. His Excellency, The Presiden/ of the Chamber of Deputies. The Speech from the Throne has explicitly alluded to the aims and wishes of the Arab Countries for freedom and independence. The best and surest way to realise these noble aspirations is for Iraq to adhere to the principles of the Atlantic charter in order that she shall take her proper place at the Peace Conference. We consider it essential for th Government to take the necessary steps for the adherence of Iraq to the principles of the said Charter, such, adherence being in the interests of ‘Iraq and of all the Arab peoples. Therefore, we ask the Government to do this as soon as possible. SADIQ MIRAN QADIR Deputy for Arbil. BAHA-EL-DIN SAID, Deputy for Diyala. HASAN SUHAIL, Deputy for Baghdad.

Our Chamber thanks the Almighty for your success in restoring constitutional government and opening our present session after defea - ting the insurrection from whose terrorism Parliament itself did not escape as we, its members, were forced to attend an unconstitutional meeting. While the Chamber appreciates the sacrifices and efforts made by Your Highness in saving Iraq from a disaster brought upon her by a handful of persons actuated by personal greed and instigated by foreign intrigue, it is fully confident that justice will be meted out to the promoters of that insurrection so that the conscience of the nation may rest at peace and the repetition of such deplorable incidents be prevented in future. We request the Government to adopt all the proposals put forward in the Speech from the Throne as we consider that they constitute a ser vice to the country and are in the interests of the nation, now endea vouring to save itself from the calamaties and disasters which are at present crushing the world , and so fulfil the pledges made to her allies in the spirit as well as in the letter of the Treaties. We pray God the Almighty to protect Iraq and to grant the country all happiness and prosperity under the rule of His Majesty King Faisal, II, and the guidance of Your Highness .REPLY TO THE SPEECH FROM THE THRONE. 2 1 ' November, 1941. HIS HIGHNESS THE REGENT, Our House thanks the Almighty for the opening of the present session of Parliament by Your Highness after the defeat of that disgra ceful insurrection in the course of which a meeting of Parliament was convened in an unconstitutional manner but which the majority of Senators did not attend. The House shares the views of Your Highness for the necessity of taking all necessary steps to ward off the dangers that threaten the very existence of the country and its constitutional government.

The Governments signatory hereto, Having subscribed to a common program of purposes, and princi ples embodied in the Joint Declaration of the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland dated August 14, 1941, known as the Atlantic Charter. Jr Being convinced that complete victory over their enemies is essential to defend life, liberty , independence and religious freedom, and to pre serve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands, and that they are now engaged in a common struggle - against savage and brutal forces seeking to subjugate the world, declare: (1) Each Government pledges itself to employ its full resources, military or economic, against those members of the Tripartite Pact and its adherents with which such government is at war. (2) Each Government pledges itself to cooperate with the Gover nments signatory hereto and not to make a separate armistice or peace with the enemies. The foregoing declaration may be adhered to by other nations which are, or which may be, rendering material assistance and contri butions in the struggle for victory over Hitlerism.■■ 13 ATLANTIC CHARTER. The President of the United States and the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for the world. First, their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other. Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned. Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them. Fourth, they will endeavou*-, with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access on equal terms to trade and to the raw mate rials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity. Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing for all improved labour standards, economic advancement and social security. Sixth, after the final destruction of Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwell ing in safety within their own boundaries and which will afford assur ance that all men in all lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want. vSeventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance. Eighth, they believe that all nations of the world for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten or may threaten aggression outside their frontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that disarmament of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace- loving peoples the crushing burden of armament./ (U NO. 27/12/43. / HIS Majesty*s Ambassador at Bagdad presents his compliments to the Political Agent at Koweit, and has the honoiir to transmit to him herewith the undermentioned document.

I. London, 19th August, .1930. Sir, 1 ' With reference to our conversations in London, I have the honour to propose that the following provisions shall beujr base in the neighbourhood of Habbaniya, then the ‘Iraq (roverninent shall take all possible steps at no cost to either Government, to arrange for the construction of a railway to connect such air base with the railway system of ‘Iraq, 8. The leases of the sites for air bases to be granted to His Britannic Majesty, in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the treaty of alliance, shall, in so far as such sites are on waste Government land, be free of all rental charges, and, in so far as they are on non-Government land, every facility shall be given for their acquisition on reasonable terms, such acquisition being effected by the ‘Iraq Govern ment at the request and at the cost of the Government of the 1 nited Kingdom. The leased lands shall be free of all taxes and rates, and the leases shall continue so long as these bases remain in the occupation of the Forces of His Britannic Majesty in accordance with the provisions of the aforesaid treaty of alliance or of any extension thereof. On the final termination of the leases of the said sites, or of any one of them, the ‘Iraq Government shall either themselves take over the buildings and permanent structures thereon at a fair valuation, having regard to the use to which they have been put, or shall afford such facilities as may reasonably be necessary to enable the Government of the United Kingdom to dispose thereof to the best advantage. After the expiry of the maximum period stipulated in Clause 1 of the annexure to the treat} T of alliance, and so long as the said treaty of alliance remains in force, the Government of the United Kingdom shall not he called upon to pay any charges in respect of the use of any of the existing emergency landing grounds in ‘Iraq. 4. The following arrangements for the disposal and administration of the ‘Iraq railway system shall be carried into effect as soon as possible, and in any case within a maximum period of 1 year from the entry into force of the treaty of alliance:— (a) Legal ownership of the railway system shall be transferred by the Government of the United Kingdom to the ‘Iraq Government and registered in the name of theimq (invermilent, and simultaneously with such transfer full beneficial ownership shall be vested, by lease or other wise, and at a nominal rent, and on terms satisfactory to the (lovernment of the United Kingdom, in a special body or corporation having legal personality, to be constituted by a special Statute of the ‘Iraq Legislature, the terms of which shall have been agreed by both Governments. (b) The above-mentioned Corporation shall be wholly responsible for the administration and management of the Traq radway system, and, subject to such limitations as may be imposed in the Statute referred to above, shall have sole and exclusive authority to raise new capital by public issue or piivate loan and to dispose of the revenues of that system. (e) The capital of the said Corporation shall comprise:— (1) Ivs. 27o Lakhs of preferred stock, bearing interest at 0 per cent., such interest being non-cumulative for a period of 20 years from the date of the transfer of the ownership of the system and thereafter cumulative to be allotted to the Government of the United Kingdom, of which Rs. 25 Lakhs represents the capitalized value of tne debt of the railways to the Government of the United Kingdom on liquidation account; 45.85 Lakhs of similar preferred stock, to be allotted to the Iraq Government, being an amount equal to the bans which the Traq Government have made to the railways on which interest charges have been waived- and (3) Rs. 250 Lakhs of deferred stock also to be allotted to the Iraq Government. The 'Iraq Government shall have the option to buy at any tnue at par the stock allotted to the Government of the United Kingdom. (rf) The Board of the Corporation shall consist of five Directors of whom two shall he appointed by the Govern ment of the United Kingdom and twe by the'‘Iraq Govern ment, and the fifth, who shall he the chairman, shall he appointed by both Governments in agreement. The first(m) I'y 17 chairman shall l)e the present Director of the ‘Iraq Kail ways. (e) The Corporation shall be responsible for raising loan capital required for the reconditioning and development of the ‘Iraq railway system, and neither CoYernment shall be under any obligation to guarantee such loan capital either in respect of interest or of capital. (f) Any loan capital raised by the Corporation for the re conditioning or development of the ‘Iraq railway system shall rank before the stock allotted to the two Govern ments in accordance with ( lause (c) above. (q) The ‘Iraq Government, as owners of the equity of the system, shall accept ultimate responsibility for any liabi lities relating thereto, not devolving upon the Corporation, that may subsequently come to light and, in consideration thereof, the Government of the United Kingdom shall transfer to the ‘Iraq Government an amount of preferred stock of a nominal value equal to the amount of any irrecoverable disbursements that the ‘Iraq Government may have to make in the discharge of any of the aforesaid liabilities, the validity of which may have been established to the satisfaction of the Government of the United Kingdom. (h) In anticipation of the transfer of the railway system and the establishment of the Corporation, the ‘Iraq Government shall forthwith grant three-year contracts, on “ treaty ” conditions, to such British railway officials as may be recommended therefor by the Director of the ‘Iraq Kail ways, and shall not terminate any such contracts when granted except with the agreement of the Government of the United Kingdom, 'i he question of granting these officials contracts of longer duration shall be left for the decision of the corporation when constituted. 5. r J he property in the port of Basra at present held by the Government of the United Kingdom shall be transferred to the ‘Iraq Government and the port shall be administered by a Port Trust.

This having been done the session was closed and Pariiamen dissolved on June 9th. under the existing Organic Law new elections will now have to be held and parliament summoned in snecial session before October 10th« The text of 1he amending law°has no? yet been polished so I cannot offer detailed comments. &lt;=,. In his last despatch Sir Kinahan Cornwallis forecast that, with a view to authorising more releases, the Prime Minister wou &gt; before long, reconstitute the Committee formed last winter to examine the records of interned persons. In the event this was done a ou the middle of June and the Prime Minister promised the Ambassaaor an opportunity to scrutinise the Committee's recommendations before they were adopted. By the end of the month, though it . approaching the end of its task, the Committee had not completed the list of persons who could be released. Meanwhile, the Prii Minister, after a brief bout of pneumonia effectively dealt with by had left for Syria. I was accordingly somewhat taken aback, on arriving at the American Legation for dinner on July 3rd, to be told by Mr. Edmonds that an hour earlier the Minister of the Interior hadijt without referring to the Commit.tee, issued orders for the release of fifty-seven internees, as Saleh jrabr was a fellow guest I lost no time m tackling him. i ° ^ Excellency justice, I do not think that the Prime Minister had told him of the understanding which had been reached with the Ambassauor and in view of the Prime Minister’s illness, he had not been able to consult him. I expressed my concern at the precipitate manner in which he had ordered these releases and invited him to explain the reasons for his action. He said that in the first place he had^ himself been primarily responsible for the adoption of a strong internment policy, and in the second that he was quite satisfied that none of the men released was at all likely to be dangerous. This second contention was largely borne out by examination of the list of those set free* Of the total of fifty-seven, thirty were found to be men of small account and twenty-two others had been provisionally classified by the Committee as fit for release. Of the remaining five, however, three were undesirables with German wives and one a thoroughly bad man named Zaki Kadhim, an ex-non-commissioned officer of the Iraqi Army who, as Physical Training Instructor in the Teachers’ Training College, had, m May 1941. earned notoriety as the organiser and leader of the so- called 'Death Squad' of students pledged to fight to the end against the British. At my request the Minister of the Interior arrange for the men with the German wives to be warned to be careful oi their conduct and ordered Zaki Kadhim to live in the provinces under close police supervision. All these people had been sent to internment from Bagdad- The releases of internees from the provinces were dealt with more regularly. The Minister of the Interior was guided by the recommendations made by the Mutasarrifs and, through the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, I was able to see th ® list of names before any releases were ordered. Of the original fifty four aames the Minister was persuaded to delete nine and oi the forty-five who remained only one was of any consequence. This was a troublesome intriguing shaikh of the Patlah tribe of Diwaniyah* He had been living under restraint in Madali and is now to be allowed to come to Baqubah. Twenty-three of the forty- five were released on July 18th and the others are expected to be set free before the end of the month. Notwithstanding the improvement in Saleh Jabr’s tactics in dealing with this second batch, I subsequently spoke very seriously to the Minister for Foreign Affaire on the need for cooperation and prior consultationr' In all natters of internal security* 6* On the night of June l6th/17th a large four-engined aircraft flew over Mosul* The next day several parachutes were discovered some miles to the west of the town and it was clear that men had been dropped with a considerable equipment for organising political disturbances, espionage and sabotage* Three German officers and one Iraqi student were eventually captured in Kurdish dress near Arbil on June 29th. The examination of these men has not yet been finished, but from the data so far collected *it seems that they intended to drop not to the west of Mosul but much further east, close to the Persian frontier and that they expected to find * ' confederates ready to help them when they landed. An unpleasant feature of this business is that about a week passed before these agents were apprehended* During that period they undoubtedly received help, including gifts of clothing and food, from friendly * villagers and possibly other helpers* A further fact that has caused no small comment is that the flight of Jtae l6th/17th was followed on succeeding nights by others, the enemy aircraft droning around at will on each occasion for some time over an extensive area. So far as I am aware t not even a rifle shot was directed at these hostile machines, ana this has not helped our local prestige* ,, 7* Nuri Pasha had intended to take leave soon after the middle of June and to pay his long talked of visit to Egypt to discuss plans for Ayah unity with hahas I as ha. The sudden illness to which I have already referred prevented him from carrying out this plan and obliged him to go to tic Lebanon for his convalescence. He left Bagdad on July 6th* His health being now apparently restored he has gone down into Egypt to fulfil his original intention, but it is not clear what proposals he will make to Nahas Pasha* At the beginning of the year ho had hopes of persuading the Egyptian Prime Minister to call together a congress of Arab leaders to draw up a plan for some kind of federation of the Arab States, but it*was later reported from Jedda that last April, he told bhe Saudi Arabian llinister that in his opinion an Arab Congress could not usefully be held until Syria and Palestine had been set free. It seems therefore that he may not yet have made up his mind whether Palestine and Syria-must have their independence before anything can be done to bring the Arab countries closer together or whether it is possible to work out a scheme for federation which would take in these countries as,they are. 8. [ After long negotiations and much argument, the Iraqi Government offered at the end of June to fix the price of barley containing ten per cent dirt at ID2C/?00 per ton delivered at collecting centres, produce tax paid. This offer, which represented a reduction of ID4/yOG or eighteen per cent on the price paid under the Iraqi Government’s fixed price scheme for the balance of the 1942 crop, was accepted by His Majesty’s Government. Owing to the Iraqi Government’s natural and characteristic reluctance to commit themselves on paper to supply a definite quantity and a last minute change of ground regarding the method of payment for barley delivered to the TJfcited Kingdom CommercialnCorporation, it was not until July 23rd that notes were finally exchanged confirming the conditions on which the Iraqi Government undertook to ensure delivery of 200.000 tons of barley at the agreed price to the Corporation. Most people think that the price cf ID20/500 is good enough to induce growers to sell their barley without aversion $ in fact, there are' signs that many of them are anxious to offer all the barley they have and not only the third at present requisitioned. The price cf barley on the farms has been fixed at UEJ/OCO* The wheat price has also been fixed - at IU25/000 on the farms for best¥ 'NMkisg®. - * - b*«t quality, thia bain* tha same price as last ye x, and at a3.-:/00C ...iilTarad at collecting centres, tax pain* * V- ^ ' 4*- lei- X. fvty The Istlhlak (aonsaaption) tax on all natwal Prodace^ was raised by one and a half per cent, and 'super' ^tax increased substantial^ ,in laws passed just before Parliaaent **j|^atafclv u- .K:) 'll -'' Jfl, -y jJfciW classes of imported goods bemtf .sftcb cheaper *Q er the i nlil i mi I tee in iuay of the new Miff for the R ■W** Kconouic Idfe of the Country and the subse'.uer.t i f^ of ^orees canalising and controlling - on paper - trade in imported goods.

Kis earlier aba was to strengthen Iraq's position vls-s-vis the Axis by weans of regional defence pacts with the other countries which were also in special Kresty relationship with Great Britain; now, hia itsaediate purpose is acre likely to be to el the aiaglvlnge that the Turkish Government have shown in the past and probably still entertain, at the prospect of a united Arab btate stretching along the whole of their southern frontier* Up to the tisie of writing this despatch the Minister for Foreign Affairs has not, however, fallen in with the iriaw Mlaiater's proposals and it now a«#ma unlikely that he will go to Turkey on this wiasion. 13. on hia return home from gypt on August 10th, tha Brl&amp;e minister found trouble waiting for hio in the cabinet. Kasrat-»l-?firlsi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was upeet that such loportant canversationa, touching Iraq's external relations, should have been carried on without his having been consul ted or even kept infortwed. he had expressed hia displeasure on this point to sever© 1 friends, end the local Taper* and Tadpoles, having heard tha story, seised their opportunity and for a few days Bagdad bussed with stories of Cabinet resignations end appointa.ents. * Kuri i aahs was, however, able after a long week-end with the Regent to appease the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and to persuade hies to defer all idea of resigning until after the assembly of the new parliament in October.% 8 contribution* not oo sauch to tho Cfaueo o/ the allies tu th* cyuat: o/ ^nity and thuo be the csore ettally justified. 17.

It is to he expected, therefore, that so soon as war-time restraints are relaxed many of them will again become actively antagonistic towards Great Britain and to the special relations of His majesty's Govern ent with the Iraqi Government.

The Iraqi Government continue to be much exercised about the future of Palestine and to regard with apprehension the influence of the Zionists over public opinion in Great Britain and the ’United States* To eeofeet this inf uence they are pressing forward plans for the creation in Gondon and I ew York of representative propaganda committees to be financed and staffed by all the Arab Governments, 1 Ians for the appointmnt of Ambassadors to Washington aiid ijondon are, however, apparently in abeyance, if cnly for the time being. 4 he Iraqi Government themselves are willing to contribute £3GG&lt;,0tu to start t &gt;e cota.

The papers discuss the possibility of an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and the domestic political situation in Iraq during and immediately after both the coup and the start of the British invasion. This includes ascertaining the political attitudes of notables, influential tribes, and military forces present in Iraq at the time. A variety of documents in the latter half of the file pertain to the British effort at stabilising the Iraqi Government following the British takeover, including discussions of its international alliances and treaty obligations.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Coup d'états</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Iraqi War (1941)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000097#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
