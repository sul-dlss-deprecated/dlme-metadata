Ebner came to see me on the 22nd^and I gave him the substance of the views of His Majesty’s Government on the gas proposal. 2. He said that he did not believe that it would come to anything^although Shah Mahmud is greatly attracted by it for the time being, and often speaks of it in confidence to his friends* Ebner said there was no doubt whatever that Shah Mahmud wanted gas for use simply against the Pathan tribes in the event of a really dangerous rising on their part; there was nothing else at all behind the proposal* The probable effect on public opinion in Afghanistan of the use of gas against such tribes was a question on which views were divided, but for the present at any rate the war Ministry were continuing their enquiries. 2, The leading spirits responsible for the idea were (i) Zafar Husain, who had again come to Ebner(on the 21st September) to discuss the importation of a certain powder from which Z*H* was sure gas could be easily and quickly developed* (Z.H* is W*W* in Afghanistan Bo* 687* He was mixed up with Obaidullah W*W*491 in 1919 and served on Badir’s staff in 1920* In 1924/25 he went to Moscow and thence to Turkey* He was reported to have acquired Turkish nationality in 1928. He graduated from the J*C.Walton Esq*, CB*,MC*, India Office, London•Turkish Military Academy in 1930 and joined the Turkish army* He returned to Kabul in 1933 and was appointed an instructor at the Harbiya College* He is believed to enjoy the special confidence of the War Minister.) (ii) Balcerkiewioz , a German chemist who was formerly employed by the Afghan Government and then dismissed for laziness* B .now found it very difficult to make a living and, in order to get money from the Afghans, had pretended, Ebner thought, to be able to make lethal gas* The Afghans had then required B.to fill a room with this gas so that they could test its effects on criminals. B.had declined on grounds of humanity and there the matter stood at present. B.was living in the same house as Ebner^who was his enemy for personal reasons and working to get him (B.) removed to Germany* If B. could be sent away probably nothing more would be heard of the gas idea* Ebner said^ that the Afghan Government could not in any case proceed with the idea on any large scale for the time being^owing to the financial straits ) in which they found themselves^ and meanv/hile he would try to induce his Minister to repatriate b. to Germany. 4* I am sending copies of this letter to Collier and Metcalfe, and Lockhart is sending a copy to Army Headquarters, Simla.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1 18th September, 1934.

THE WAR OFFICE, LONDON, S.W. 1, 26th July, 1934 1* In reply to your letter ITo •P.Z .4400/34 dated 6th July, 1934, on the subject of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Afghan Government’s project of producing gas shells in # Afghanistan, I am commanded by the Army Council to state as follows, for the information of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare. 2. The Council observe that the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925 has not been signed by Afghanistan. It has been fully ratified by Persia. Great Britain and Russia have ratified, with reservations to the effect that the Protocol only binds them in relation to States which have signed and ratified, or which have definitely acceded to the Protocol, and that it shall cease to be binding in regard to all enemy States whose armed forces do not respect the restrictions of the Protocol. 3. It is thus obvious that if the Afghan Government were to use,or were known to intend to use gas, they would be inviting Russia,in the event of hostilities,to do the same. It need hardly be pointed out that the Russian reserves and facilities are immeasurably greater than those of Afghanistan • 4. The Council feel that it would be well, if opportunity occurs,for His Majesty’s Minister to emphasise to the Afghan Government the practical difficulties, dangers and costs of the project contemplated by them. The more important of these factors can be summarised as follows The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. 31 (a)./ 2 AUG. • 1 i .(a) Gas is a very technical weapon. Its successful use is largely dependent upon meteorological conditions which vary considerably in the different parts of Afghanistan. (fc) Gas in bulk or in shells could not be imported through India. The Government of India presumably would not sanction the transportation of gas through India on account of the risk to life involved. &gt; (c) The pro auction of gas in Afghanistan would involve 4 the establishment of a local chemical industry directed by skilled personnel. (d) Gas can only be stored in bulk in specially constructed tanks which are^ expensive. Even then, as far as is known, it deteriorates during storage. (e) The machinery for filling gas shells is very expensive and can only be handled by experts. - ‘ ' ’• * (f) It is known that gas stored in filled shells deteriorates during storage. Under such conditions the danger from leakage is considerable. Continuous expert inspection is essential. (g) If the use of gas were contemplated, the Afghan Army would have to be equipped with gas masks. - • &lt; Finally, I am to say that the Council agree with the views Government of India expressed in telegram No.1352 dated 11th June, 1934, that everything possible should be done to discourage and prevent the project. The Council share the views held by the Commander-in-Chief in India and agree that, if it appears that,the Afghans are thinking of gas in connection with tne soviet danger, it might be explained to them that we are prepared oo give advice regarding anti-gas defence.

The question of the attitude of H.M.Gr. towards the supply of das appliances to Afghanistan cropped up before in connection with a request by the Afghan Legation for transit facilities /nArw-JCd. for tear gas pistols (see^P.Z. 6549/32 - Foreign Office reference N.6978/82/97), and we then came to the conclusion that it was not open to us in present circumstances to remonstrate with the Afghans about the weapons they might choose to use either in war or for quelling internal disturbances however much we might wish to discourage them from using poison gas, whether lethal or non-lethal. deneral Muspratt then gave reasons for disliking the idea of allowing tear gas to enter Afghanistan^ even as a sample ; though he appreciated the difficulty of refusing facilities for its transit through India. It seems best therefore in replying to Sir R.

We fe^t. however, that we could not, in present circumstances, remonstrate with the Afghan Government about the weapons they might choose to use either in war or for quelling civil disturbances, particularly as such weapons are not prohibited by any international agreement to vhich Afghanistan is a party. 3/2 3# Our inclination would therefore be to reply to that effect to Herr Ebner, but feel that this is an important matter in which the G.of I. are closely concernedwe should prefer to defer sending you a definite reply until we have had an expression of the G.of I. *s views, ^n-d we should like to have an opportunity of discussing 4-fc with the War Office here.

Herr Ebner wanted to know what the attitude of His Majesty’s Government would be in regard to this project, as he was anxious, before taking any action in pursuance of it, to know confidentially that by doing so he would not be acting against British interests. 2. The idea was still, I gathered, only in the air, but I should be glad to be informed at your early convenience what answer I should give to HQrr Ebner’s enquiry. 4.

P.Z. 6649/32. Department. The Afghan Minister m London announces that his Legation in Paris has already despatched by parcel post, through Messrs. T. Cook and Son, consigned to the Afghan Consul at Karachi, a tear gas pistol, with two cartridges, two tear gas bombs, and a gas mask, which have been ordered as samples. The Afghan Legation has been asked to find out from Paris on what date these parcels were despatched, and on receipt of that information it is suggested that a telegram, a draft of which is attached, might be sent to the Government of India, enquiring whether they are willing to allow facilities for their transportation through India. It is clear, I think, that, although this apparatus is no doubt designed for use m civil t* « disturbances, it is properly to be regarded as munitions within the meaning of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921, and we should, m strictness, receive an application for facilities through the British Legation at Kabul. As the Afghan Legation m Paris has, however, sent off the goods already, it v/ill perhaps be sufficient to enquire of the Government of India whether they are prepared to allow the parcels to proceed. They v/ill, of / course, if necessary, consult the Charge d'Affaires at Kabul. The military authorities in this country are distinctly averse from encouraging the employment of i gas appliances in Oriental countries, and the policy of H.K.G. in the United Kingdom is to avoid the use of such methods in territories under their control. It is hardly/hardly possible, however, to decline transit facilities for such appliances altogether, and, while it may be well later on to communicate particulars of the transaction to the War Office for information, we should not, I think, without further consideration take up the question of remonstrating with the Afghans on the use of such methods in warfare. ^ , , _ A U*jl *1 A ^ , U ^ is * ^ * \ x x (rTIfy* ly A *'*f l~-J~&lt;J£&gt;* */ id— t/. 4 7-LMINUTE. ''N I do not like the idea of tear gas entering Afghanistan, even though only as a sample, because (i) H.M.G. have strictly refrained from using gas in any form, including tear gas for civil disturbances. Consequently we have none in India. Although admittedly tear gas has no lethal effect, we should feel more comfortable if there was none in the possession of our neighbours. (ii) If the experiment with tear gas appeals to the Afghans, as new devices frequently do, there is always the possibility of their wanting to try their hand with some other and less noxious chemicals. However, as matters stand, I appreciate the difficulty of refusing transit facilities, and even were we to do so it is probable that sooner or later the Afghans would get what they want through Persia or Russia.
