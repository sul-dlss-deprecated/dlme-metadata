It further reminds the Government that both the Al Ali, and Mahomed ben Abdullah would be in violation of the reconciliation with the Chief of Bahrain if this migration takes place.The item has three enclosures:1. Letter Office No. 345 of 1855 from the Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf to Commodore Richard Ethersey, Commander of the Indian Naval Squadron in the Persian Gulf, at Bassidore [Bāsaʻīdū] dated Bushire 8 October 1855.The enclosure is authorising the use of force — as a last resort — in order to prevent the expected migration of the Al Ali tribe to the Arabian Coast.The enclosure also includes a translated extract of a letter from the Agent at Bahrein to the Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 30 September 1855. It is reporting that thirty-five boats belonging to the Al Ali tribe have landed at Demaun and that they propose returning with their families; it notes that the pearl fishing season has ended, so that cannot be their reason for putting to sea.2.

Translation of a letter from the Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf to Mahomed Abdullah, Chief of Demaun, dated Bushire 8 October 1855.The enclosure is reminding the Shaikh that permitting the Al Ali tribe to settle at Demaun would be a violation of the reconciliation agreed to with the Chief of Bahrein, and would render their boats open to seizure by the British.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x000044#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
