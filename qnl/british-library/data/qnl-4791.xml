Bullard also wonders whether Colonel Dickson had anything definite in mind when he suggested some qui d pro quo to Ibn Saud. Akaba- Maan, if Colonel Dickson was thinking of that, is out of the question, and apart from the possibility of the Khor-al-Odeid, on which we are consulting the G. of I. and the Political Resident, there does not seem to be any possibility of a territorial concession. I doubt its being desirable to ask Colonel Dickson whether he ha any definite suggestion. As regards the Hedjaz railway, which is mentioned by Sir R. Bullard, a note by Hr. Symon is attached. As regards the outstanding point about meeting the expenditure required to recondition the Hedjaz section of the line, a year ago Sir R. Bullard saw no advantage in offering to pay for it, but he is now going to consider the point again.r FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l.

My dear Rendel, Your E 7201/22/31 Private and Confidential of 15th December, about Dickson’s visit to Riyadh, reached me so shortly oefore I had to seu off to meet Ibn Baud on 4th January that all I had time to do was to send you a note saying that Dickson’s report was douotless accurate as to Ion Saud’s own views. I meant, of course, that he gives an accurate summary of what Ibn Baud said, not that I accepted his deductions. Having now had time to studp the conclusions I accept (a), and of the other two I am inclined to question (cj rather than (b). As to (o;i as the result of my two interview's since my return I feel that only a world war could drive Ion saud into tne other camp. Tnat is how I interpret his feelings, though I do not say that he has ever gone so far as to work out nis position in the case of a world war. But tnere is a reser Vail ion to be made, he c annot tTe^r -r^rdop t * . -■ ■&lt; If this is Ibn Baud’ s feeling it^ is''because believe that in thd last resort H.M.G. will a Palestine.; policy grossly unfair to the Al'abs.

If we were to decide on partition after all, or to allow Jewish immigration to go on at the high rate of the last few/ G.W. Rendel Esq., C.M.Gd) ^ few years before tne Commission, I cannot say what he would do, though I think that for as long as possiole he would just keep on trying to induce us to change our As to (c) I am not sure. 1 should like to know whether Dickson had anything definite in mind when he suggested that some quid pro quo should oe given to Ion Saud for his support. He needs arms and money, but whatever quantity we gave him (and in fact we cannot give him either; tne present would have to be concealed and therefore would not influence public opinion. Territory we can only give him at the expense of some other ruler. Perhaps Dickson is thinking of Akaba and Maan - a very thorny question. There is of course the Mejaz Railway. I had been thinking that question over again, a year ago I could find no political advantage in paying for tne repair of tne damaged section, but we have greater reason now to feel obliged to Ton Saud, and \i | a douceur like this might give him satisfaction. Moreov' j Fuad suggests tnat the railway receipts should not but into a separate fund for railway purposes - repairs, upkeep, depreciation, etc. I will examine the question again. And meanwhile perhaps Dickson has some definite suggestion. I am sure that it does Ibn Saud good to let off steam now and then, and for tnat reason alone Dickson’s visit must have been useful. Dickson talks almost perfect Arabic, having learnt it as a child, and moreover minds Saudi Government/ (in respect of the Saudi part; he// he is not an official. Thus, wnile the King let nimself go about the Jews when talking to me he was even more violent with Dickson. It is not fair to say, as some critics of tne Zionist policy say, that it is we who are responsiole for the anti-Jew feelings of the present-day AraD, for Muhammad planted those feelings and tney are kept alive by the Koran. But 1 have no doubt that our policy has made the antagonism worse. Ion Sand’s desire to see every few months some British officer to whom he can open his heart is interesting. Unfortunately almost tne only man who fills the bill is Dickson. On tne other hand Ion Sand’s valued friend Sir P. Cox, was a wretched Arabic scholar. Nor does Ion Sand do justice to Shaikh Hafiz Wahoa, who I am sure transmits his masters instructions faithfully. But I will write about tnis again. Yours ever, (3d.) R.W. Bullard.The Hejaz Rai lway._ The railway was built in 19C0 by the late Sultan Abdul Hamid of Turkey and was partly financed by voluntary subscriptions. It passed out of Turkish control after the ^ar and so far as H.M.G. are concerned the status of the railway is now governed by the Governments at a meeting of the Economic and financial Commission of the Lausanne Conference held on 27th January 19 23. has been unable to accept this declaration. The sections of the railway passing through Syria and the Transjordan still remain open, but both are Arabia has been unworkable for nearly twenty years. In 1925 King Ibn Baud raised the question of the repair and opening up of the whole of the railway and as a result of discussion with the French Government he was invited by the two Governments jointly to send delegates to a Conference to discuss purely technical questions connected with the railway. The invitation was accepted and the Conference duly met at Haifa in August 1928, but at the first meeting the Saudi delegate until the question of the ownership and unity of the railway had been first determined. As H.M.G. and the French Government regarded this question as decided by the Lausanne declaration referred to above ana as the Saudi delegate refused to change his attitude it was impossible to proceed. Nothing further of importance happened until in1934 the Saudi Government approached H.M.G. and the French Government with a suggestion that a further Conference should be held to discuss technical questions connected with the re-conditioning of the railway leaving on one side, by simple reservat_i_qn_ , any que stion regarding the ownershi p jojr ^c hara cter of the railway. This invitation was accepted with the reservation referred to and the Conference duly met at Haifa in October 1935 to consider the following points:- (l) Examination of the degree of reconditioning which the railway requires; (°.) Preparation of an estimate of the cost of the necessary work; (3) Establishment of the manner in which the necessary expense is to be met; (4) Consideration of a project for the organisation of a train service along the whole length of the railway; (5) Consideration of a project for the eventual distribution of rolling stock among the different sections of the line. A summary of the conclusions is given in the attached note. As will be seen, points (l), (2), (4) and (5) were satisfactorily settled but no agreement was reached in regard to the method for meeting the expense necessary for reconditioning the Hejaz section of the line. Failure to reach agreement on this important point has left matters in suspense and it appears probable that the only possible way of raising the money to finance the rebuilding of the Hejaz section is that H.M.G. should provide it. The question whether there is a case, on general political grounds, for H.M.G. undertaking to pay part or the whole of the cost of rebuilding was referred to the Minister at Jedda for his observations last year, ^nd his views, which are summarised below, / ^re contained in the Jedda Despatch No.20 of the 10th / February/ C copy attachedMinute Paper Department. copy attached February 1937. 'The railway is not necessary, and if it were rebuilt the Saudi authorities could never keep it running properly for more than a short time. H.M.G. are under no moral obligation to pay for the rebuilding of the line; they would get little credit if they did pay for it; our help would weigh for little in the mind of Ibn Saud among other important considerations and would be forgotten if the railway did not pay its way and became a burden; it is not to the advantage of H.M.G. that Ibn Saud should be saddled with another financial obligation; and the possibility of our being allowed to use the railway in time of war is so remote as to be by itself of very little weight.” On 20th January 1936 the Saudi Government / addressed a note (to which no reply has yet been sent by H.M.G.) to the British and French Legations at Jedda regarding the outcome of the Haifa Technical Conference. Fothing of importance has happened since, but it is understood that the Saudi Minister in London recently drew attention to the unanswered note and enquired how the matter stood. The Foreign Office are now considering what reply to make. i (J474B Wt 22530/P 144 10,000 9.37 IOPDeclaration made on behalf of the British and French Governments at a meeting of the Economic and Financial Commission of the Lausanne Conference held on 27th January, 1923. The Governments of France and Great Britain, acting on behalf of Syria, Palestine and Transjordania, and desiring to recognise the religious character of the Hejaz Railway, declare that they are ready to accept the constitution of an advisory council with power to submit to the administrations of the different sections of the railway lying in Syria, Palestine, Transjordania and the Kingdom of the Hejaz recommendations for the upkeep of the line and for the improvement of the conditions of the pilgrim traffic. This council will include four Moslem members appointed respectively by Syria, Palestine, Transjordania and the Hejaz and will itself choose its president, and two other members amongst the nationals of other Moslem countries interested in the pilgrimage. It will sit at Medina. The recommendations of this council must not be contrary to the provisions of the international sanitary conventions. The French and British Governments declare that in so far as concerns the sections of the railway lying in Syria, Palestine and Transjordania, any profits realised will be devoted to the upkeep and improvement of the whole of the railway. Any sums left over after such improvement will be devoted to the assistance of pilgrims.———aw STMary 0^ C0NCLTTSI0IS. IThIM 1 . EXAMINATION 0^ THE DEGREE ON RECOND IT IONING YHIC H THeTa fLW ^ Y R_EQJ JIR_EG._ The Conference considered that the line should be repaired to the minimum compatible with safety, bearing in mind the regular running of one train a week and additional trains when required especially during the five months of the heavier traffic. It was considered that this minimum reconditioning should include the reconstruction of bridges but it should eliminate all stations except those required for water, engine changing and train crossing purposes. ITEM 2 . PREPARAT ION qt? ajj EST IM ATE QN THE CO GT OR THE NECESS ARY WORK. ~ The approximate estimates of reconstruction in the degree recommended under Item 1 are £P. 35,000 for the Maan- Mudawara section and £P.125,000 for the Mudawara-Medina section. To these figures should be added 20$ for the transport of materials and contingent and unforeseen expenditure giving figures of £P. 42,000 and £P. 150,000 or a total for the whole work of £P. 192,000. The Conference emphasized that this estimate was based on present conditions and information and should only be considered as approximate. ITEM 3.

While recording the proposal of Fuad Bey Hamza to the effect that the reconstruction of the sections damaged should be effected at the expense of the line as a whole, the Conference regretted that it had not been able to reach an agreed resolution on this important question. In these circumstances, the Conference could only commend the matter to/to the consideration of the G-overntnents concerned.

I may say that until your above-mentioned despatch was received, m so far as I had considered the question, I felt vaguely that it would be a good thing if the line could be rebuilt, and that His Majesty’s Government might even be justified in contributing something towards the cost. Now that I have examined the problem more closely, I have come to the contrary conclusion. 2. The arguments set forth in the enclosure to this despatch may be summarised thus. The railway is not necessary, and if it were rebuilt the Saudi authorities could never keep it running properly for more than a short time. His Majesty’s Government are under no moral obligation to pay for the rebuilding of the line; they would get little credit if they did pay for it; our help would weigh for little in the mind of Ibn Saud, among other important considerations, and would be forgotten if the railway did not pay its way and became a burden; it is not to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government that Ibn Saud should be saddled with another financial obligation; and the possibility of our being allowed to use the railway in time of war is so remote as to be, by itself, of very little weight. 3. Some of the arguments which I have adduced against the proposal would fall to the ground if it could be shown that the railway receipts would cover the cost of maintenance and renewals—and that they would be used for that purpose. It is difficult to estimate the number of passengers that there would be, but it is quite certain that the passenger traffic would depend mainly on the pilgrimage, and would therefore be seasonal to an extent hardly known anywhere else in the world, and it seems to a lay mind that a railway is the most uneconomic method of dealing with such traffic. What revenue might be expected to accrue to the Saudi exchequer from the carriage of grain from Transjordan can better be calculated there than here. But of one thing we can be certain, i.e., that there is no ground for supposing that the railway receipts would be set aside for maintenance and renewals, or that the line could be run with tolerable efficiency over a period of years. I have quoted the Jedda condenser as an analogy, and that is an example favourable to the Saudi authorities, since the condenser is simple compared with a railway system, it is under their eyes, and its possible profits are known to a dollar. But not only are repairs not executed when they begin to be necessary, but the money for essential spares, which it takes months to obtain from abroad, cannot be extracted from the Minister of Finance, who deals with the condenser personally, until the machine is in danger of breaking down or has actually stopped. The railway revenue would be used as general revenue, the smallest possible sums would be spent on the line, and the railway employees would be months in arrear with their salaries and would be selling spares and material to keep themselves alive. The Saudi Government would never offer the salaries required to secure well-trained railway experts, and if they had such experts at their disposal they would not give them the authority, still less the financial powers, necessary for the proper administration of the line, but would run it themselves by the penny-farthing methods which they apply to all commercial and industrial activities. EASTERN (Arabia). March 1, 1937. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4 . [E 1243/875/23] Copy No. 121 X- Bullard to Mr. Eden.—(Received March 1.) (No. 20.) ’ I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. [956 a—4]mssm 2 Enclosure. The Hejaz Railway. SHOULD the line from Ma’an to Medina be rebuilt, and, if so, should His# Majesty’s Government pay part or the whole of the cost of rebuilding ? The main considerations, for and against. (1) The line is necessary. The line would be convenient for some pilgrims, but it cannot be considered necessary, for pilgrims manage very well without it, either sailing from Syrian or Palestinian ports or going by rail to Suez and taking ship from there. When the Hejaz Railway was planned motor transport was hardly thought of. To-day pilgrims can travel from Nejaf to Medina quite easily by car, and although the journey from Ma’an to Medina by car is at present very difficult, it has been accomplished, and the route might perhaps be improved for much less money than would have to be spent on a railway. The passenger traffic on the line would be seasonal, with a very low level for three-quarters of the year and a rise with two tremendous peaks in the remaining quarter. The Hejaz Railway would be particularly useful for pilgrims from Turkey, but for the last ten years the number of Turkish pilgrims has not exceeded 200, and this low figure, which is due to the financial and religious policy of the Turkish Government, is not likely to rise considerably for a long time, if ever. How far a railway is required for transport ing grain from Transjordan to the Hejaz must be left for experts. The transport of grain is effected somehow at present, and it must be remembered that a railway would deprive of their livelihood many people who now live by animal transport in that area. (2) His Majesty’s Government should rebuild the line because it was they who destroyed, it. In the first place it must be remembered that the line was built in the teeth of the Sharif (afterwards King) Husain. He and his tribes did, in fact, prevent the extension of the line to Mecca. It is no excuse to say that the Hejaz did not want a railway connecting it with Turkey, but does want one connecting it with the Arab States to the north. The fact remains that if the Sharif Husain had had his way the line would never have reached Medina. Then, while it is true to say that His Majesty’s Government destroyed the line, the destruction was accomplished with the assent and enthusiastic co-operation of the Arabs in com bined operations for a common end, and the Arabs gained enormously as the result of the war, and at extremely low cost to themselves. Besides, what of the other countries allied to or associated with Great Britain for the purposes of the war ? To represent the destruction of the railway as effected by His Majesty’s Govern ment for their own ends is unreasonable and unfair. (3) His Majesty’s Government would gain credit in the Moslem World if they faid for the reconstruction of the line. We do not seem to have incurred blame for the obvious part we took in the destruction of the line, and discredit is easier to acquire than credit. Our credit in the Moslem world is likely to rest upon more essential matters, e.g., our policy in Palestine. We might even be attacked in some quarters for interfering in the Holy Land, for constructing a railway with strategical and imperialistic aims, and so on. To meet, or to forestall, such criticisms Ibn Saud would probably have to minimise any part played by His Majesty’s Government in the business, just as at present he is carefully keeping the name of Italy out of all references to Saudi aviation, which is indebted to Italy in many respects for such little activity as it is showing. To sum up : the credit gained would probably be small, and there would be criticism which would counteract it, at least to some extent; and his position in the Moslem world might even compel Ibn Saud to minimise the part His Majesty’s Government had played in the restoration of the line.•53 maammmm 3 (4) The railway would be of advantage to Saudi Arabia, and we should therefore earn the gratitude of Ibn Saud by yaying for it to be rebuilt. It is submitted that Ibn Sand’s attitude towards His Majesty’s Government will be decided by so many important considerations that such gratitude as we might earn (at heavy financial cost) by rebuilding the railway would not weigh ** r ery heavily in the balance. Moreover, unless the railway receipts covered main- Lengmce and renewals, Ibn Baud’s gratitude for the past might soon be forgotten in anxiety for the future, and he might even look to His Majesty’s Government to meet the deficit and be more dissatisfied at their refusal than he seems to be with the situation as it is at present. Whether the railway could be made to pay is a question for experts. We can be certain that people who only ran the Jedda condenser with great difficulty would run a railway with the same centralised inefficiency, and that it would speedily deteriorate for lack of essential repairs and replacements. Unless it is quite certain that the railway would not become a burden to Saudi Arabia its reconstruction is not to be recommended from the British point of view, for nothing that causes the financial situation of Saudi Arabia to deteriorate would be to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government in the long run. A self-supporting Ibn Saud is less likely to covet oil-fields, ports (with custom-houses) and taxable populations that are either under our control or at least kept out of his control by our influence, than an Ibn Saud who is always pulling the devil by the tail. (5) The railway might be of strategic value to His Majesty's Government in time of war. This would only apply if Saudi Arabia was our ally, and that seems, from the observation post of Jedda, to be a very remote contingency to work to. In case of a European war, Saudi Arabia would be in a position similar to that of Turkey in 1914, when the Central Powers could offer Turkey important territorial gains at the expense of the Allies, and the most the Allies could hope for was to persuade her to maintain neutrality. His Majesty’s Government would have reason to be satisfied if Saudi Arabia remained neutral, and to spend money on the railway in the hope that we might be allowed to use it in war time would seem to be a highly speculative investment. But, of course, if there were other important con siderations which were in favour of the reconstruction of the line, that faint chance of our being allowed to use it in war time would be an additional induce ment, provided—a point which must be left to experts in strategy—the railway could not be made an important weapon against us if Saudi Arabia should join the enemies of His Majesty’s Government.P.Z.2820/1956. Eneloswe in Despatch No.49 from Jedda, dated 16th February, 1936. Translation of Note from Saudi Government to British and French Legations. Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Mecca. Dhu 1 1 Qa 1 da 4, 1354. (January 20, 1936.) Your Excellency, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that I have received a copy of the minutes of the meetings of the conference of Haifa which was held from the 10th to the 17th October, 1955, and was attended by representatives of the Saudi Arab, British and French Governments. I am glad to inform you of the following:- Firstly . - The conference held five meetings. Its discussions were technical, as was determined prior to the meeting, and in accordance with the following agenda:- 1. Examination of the degree of reconditioning v/hich the railway requires. 2* Preparation of an estimate of the cost of the necessary work. 5. Establishment of the manner in which the necessary expense is to be met. 4. Consideration of a project for the organisation of a train service along the whole length of the railway. 5. Consideration of a project for the eventual distribution of rolling-stock among the different sections of the line. Secondly . - I am glad to state that the conference succeeded in drawing up a basis of agreement in respect of items 1, 2, 4 and 5 of the agenda, as you may observe from the report; but it is regretted that the conference declared ius failure to reach an agreed solution in respect of item 5, regarding expenses and how to cover them, and left the question of raising funds to the Governments themselves. Thirdly/Thirdly . - I give you hereunder a copy of the text of the paragraph in the report regarding the decision of the conference about item 3:~ 'While recording the proposal of Fuad Bey Hamza to the effect that the reconstruction of the damaged sections should he effected at the expense of the line as a whole, the conference regretted that it had not been able to reach an agreed resolution on this important question. In these circumstances, the conference could only commend the matter to the consideration of the Governments concerned. !I I also v/ish to mention the reply given by the representative of the French Government to his colleagues in the conference concerning the conditions on v/hich he believes it would be possible for one portion of the line to help the other in its expenses. The text is as follows:- 'M# Vasselet, speaking for the Syrian section, said that contribution by this section to expenditure in respect of sections situated outside its territory was envisaged by the Lausanne (Bompard) Declaration. At the present time, however, the conditions provided by that Declaration had not been realised. During recent years, far from realising any profit and despite the reduction in expenditure which had now reached its lov/est limit, the working of the section had resulted in a deficit. The settlement of the question submitted to the conference must, therefore, necessarily be sought in a different manner to that which has been proposed.” Fourthly . - The Government of His Majesty the King appreciate the many economic advantages which would accrue to this country, and all other countries through which the line passes, as a result of the reopening of the unserviceable section. They therefore v/ish to draw the attention of the French and British Governments to the only solution v/hich would in practice, assist in the reopening of that part, viz., the line should be considered as one and should bear as a ?/hole the expenses to be incurred on the damaged sections south of Ma’an. In the event of Your Excellency’s Government agreeing to accept this fundamental principle now, there will naturally be occasion to discuss how the necessary funds should be raised for the repairs, whether by loan or by other means, to be studied later5 I shall he glad if your Government will assist in the settlement of this outstanding question 'by agreeing to the principle of the unity of the line, as mentioned above. I am sending a true copy of this note to your French colleague.

(Sgd.) J.G. Walton. Lieu t en&amp;nl-Jolone1 H.R.P. Dickson, Kuwait.Personal and Confidential ■ Kuwait, Persian Gulf Nov.2nd 1937 crr&lt; I have just returned from my trip (31.10.37) to Riyadh j which you remember I told you about when I was in England. The wife and I were originally invited by the King to leave Kuwait on 21st Oct. but a later telegram from him fixed our date for the 23rd, so we left Kuwait that day in two cars, and covered the distance of approx: 500 miles to the King ! s Capital in exactly 1734 driving hours. Weather conditions were perfect and we found the nights distinctly cold in the heart of Najd. The desert scenery en route was wild in the extreme, and the only sign of life outside Jerriya frontier post were six gazelle and 1 Bustard. We spent actually Wk most enjoyable days with the King and put in a very full programme, of audiences, banquets and sightseeing, not to mention witnessing a grand ! Ardha or w r ar dance, given on the morning of our last day in our honour it was said, but in reality to celebrate the ’’completed” reading through of the Koran by one of the King’s small sons (Khatim they call a boy who has finished such reading). morning after I arrived, followed by two subsequent shorter interviews of half an hour each the third and fourth mornings of my sojourn. My wife also met all the Royal ladies including the famous sister of the King, by name Nura, and was most kindly, and indeed affectionately received by them on all three occasions: The wife was particularly attracted by the Lady Nura, who she described as one of the most loveable and charming women she has ever met, with all the magnetism and character of her great brother the King, and clearly one of the most important personages in-the State and sharing in the King’s most intimate councils. As the India Office and I think RendfcL will be interestec to hear what the King had to say to me about Palestine and relations with His Majesty’s Government in general, I am taking the liberty of sending you in precis form, a summary of what passed between us, or rather I should say what the King said, for as is usual with him he did all the talking and did not allow me to get in a word edgeways. I naturally made it quite clear to the King that my visit was of a purely private and personal nature, also that I r had received both the India Office and Foreign Office blessing f before I came, but the King nevertheless hinted that he hoped I &gt; * would 'pass on' what I heard to the proper quarter even if such - ** proceeding was somewhat irregular. I had a full two hours audience with the King theOn the way in to Riyadh and out again I took copious notes of the country lying along 'both sides of the road, using a compass and the milometre readings of my car, so I shall be able shortly to get out a fairly complete road report as from Kuwait to Riyadh, This I shall send you as soon as ready, as I think it may be found of use both by the Intelligence branch of the India Office and also the War Office. Perhaps after you have read the report through you could pass it on to the above departments. Incidentally I found several mistakes in the Official Million Sheet map of Arabia, and was able to fill in many place names as well as mark in the exact course of the good motor route which today exists between Kuwait and Riyadh. I had with me Philby’s 1.500,000 route sheets (printed by the War Office in 1953) showing the Kuwait route out of Riyadh, but as this stopped short Just north of the great Dahana sand belt, or a third of the way to Kuwait only,my completed road map, though not made with the accuracy of Philby will be found of use I think. Incidentally I found Philby’s route report to contain a rather bad error or two obviously due to mistakes in printing: these I have corrected. On my return to Kuwait I sent the usual telegraphic message of thanks to the King, and received today a very gracious reply. Needless to say I did not mention at all any of the political questions affecting Kuwait and Najd, such as Blockade etc., as this would not have been proper. Nor did the King touch on anything of such nature, beyond enquiring how the oil boring in the Southern half of the State was progressing. The King did however show an interest in the coming HaJ, and asked why it was that Shaikh Ahmad kept on putting off his, the King’s, invitation to him to visit Riyadh and accompany him to Mecca on the next pilgrimage. I promised to pass on the King’s comments to Shaikh Ahmad, who I know is only held back by the question of expense. Riyadh For the rest, I went all over the city and suburbs of A entirely unhindered (including the old capital of Dhara’iyeh), and visited the two wireless stations, the Royal garage, the new Power house and the magnificent new Kings Palaceknown as the ’’Shamsiyeh”, which is in course of erection two miles north of the city. Nor must I forget the race course, the Rashidite ’AJlan fort rushed by Abdul Aziz when he seized Riyadh by his remarkable coup de main at the beginning of his career, and the bazaars. The King graciously and spontaneously said I could go anywhere and everywhere as I was ’’his old friend, and a well wisher of the Arabs”. Both my wife and I adopted the Arab garb. Before leaving the King gave the good news of excellent rains through] out the west and north of his kingdom, and shortly after arriving back in Kuwait our first rain for 9 months fell here: so Arabia should do well as far as grazing for camels and sheep is concerned during the winter and spring of 1937 - 38 . fif you see no objec tion May I ask you to pass this on to RendMTof the F.O.y and also to accept both my wifes and my sincere regards and good wishes to Mrs Walton and yourself. Yours sincerely, P • T. o.P.S. (a) Our new Oil well 32 miles South of Kuwait at Burgan has to date reached a depth of 750 feet : We are now engaged in 'casing” operations, or piping the hole so far bored; - except for a little Bitumen which the drill has gone through, there is nothing of interest to report. We are of course hoping for sucess this time, but as the Sheikh says 'Everything is in God’s hands'. (b) The Princess Nura was deeply interested in the Company’s new oil township of 'Magwa' my wife tells me, and from what she said she believes it to be some form of military fort or post erected to defend the Southern frontier of Kuwait. My wife had some difficulty in making her understand that there was no fort of any kind.

H.R.P.Dickson at Riyadh on October 25th, 27 th and 28th 1937* (From notes taken down immediately afterwards by the writer). Audience No.l Riyadh October 25th. Time 9am. After presenting myself at the Foreign Minister’s office in the great Palace I was conducted to the King’s great Mijliss (Council Hall) by His Excellency Sir Fuad Hamza. I found his Majesty seated at the top end of the imposing room, and to the right and left of him, though some way down the room and at a distance sat the leading Amirs and officials of State. These consisted of the following: Amir Abdul Aziz bin Musa’ad, Governor of Hail 11 Mohomed ibn Tallal al Rashid L Royal ” Faisal ibn Tallal al Jabbar al Rashid j 5:S u S§sfiJd. ” Abdulla ibn Mita’ab al Rashid J ' Faisal ibn Saad (King’s nephew) King’s sons (King's grandson) small sons of the King sitting in a corner. Members of Kings Council Mahmud Jassur editor of the Radio Bulletin ” Mohomed ” Mansur ” A.bdulla ibn Turki ” Tallal ” Misha’al r ” Nawaf Seyed Hamza Gauth 1 Seyed Sharif Sharaf j After the customary salutations, His Majesty introduced me to the above, and asked me to be seated by his side. Fuad Hamza also took his seat by Seyed Hamza Gauth. Then followed polite enquiries after the health of Mrs Dickson and myself delivered with the King’s customary charm of manner. ”0 Dickson not only are you our friend, and the friend of the Arabs, but I see you come garbed as one of us and so are doubly welcome ” is a sample of some of the King’s polite references. His Majesty early on turned to the subject obviously close to his heart, namely the Palestine tangle, and for close on an hour and a half delivered himself as follows. He spoke for the most part in low earnest voice as though his words were not intended for his Counsellors sitting round and he continually kept placing his hand on my arm as though to. emphasize his meaning.(Here I shall use the King’s words as near as possible using the first person plural for the most part). ”We are aware 0 Dickson that you are no longer a Govern ment Official, but as you have held high and honourable post under His Majesty’s Government for many years, we know also that you are trusted by your Government, and so not only do we make you doubly welcome, but we feel we can open our heart to you, and we are glad that you have been able to visit us in our capital.” ”We are most anxious that the British Government should send us every eight months or so, an experienced officer whom they trust, or equally well an ex-official like yourself, who can listen personally to what we have on our minds, and what troubles our hearts, for times are deeply serious and full of danger these days, fe feel that personal contact of such a nature will be far more efficatious, than any amount of letter writing or tele graphic representations: The latter though well enough in themselves must nearly always fail to convey the full meaning of our thoughts and anxieties, and if anything will tend rather to breed misunderstanding and mis conception than remove same. But such person, if and when he is sent us must be thoroughly conversant with our language (Arabic), and must understand the wider meaning of our beautiful tongue which is so full of parable and expressive phrase. It is no use sending a man who has to listen to what we have to say through the medium of an interpreter. The person sent should know and understand our Arab phsycology, be conversant If possible with our Arabian manners and customs, and above all should be acquainted with our Arab pride and our hopes, and have read something of God’s Holy Word, as vouchafed to us in our Blessed Koran.” ”0 Dickson when will your London Government realize that v/e Arabs by our very nature can be bought body and soul by an act of kindness, and vice versa become implacable enemies for all time of those who treat us harshly or deal unjustly with us.” ”To-day we and our subjects are deeply troubled over this Palestine question, and the cause of our disquiet and anxiety is the strange attitude of your British Government, and the still more strange hypnotic influence which the Jews, a race accursed by God accord ing to His Holy Book, and destined to final destruction and eternal damnation hereafter, appear to weild over them and the English people generally”.’’God’s Holy Book'(the Koran) contains God’s own word and divine ordinance, and we commend to His Majesty's Government to read and carefully peruse that portion which deals with the Jews and especially what is to he their fate in the end. for God’s words are unalterable and must be.” ”We Arabs believe implicitly in God’s revealed word and we know that God is faithful/. We care for nothing else in this world but our belief in the One God, His Prophet, and our Honour , everything else matters nothing at all, not even death, nor are we afraid of hardship, hunger, lack of this worlds goods etc. etc. and we are quite content to eat camels meat and dates to the end of our days, provided we hold to the above three things.' 'Our hatred for the Jews dates from God’s condemnation of them for their persecution and rejection of Isa (Jesus Christ), and their subsequent rejection later of His chosen Prophet. It Is beyond our understanding how your Government, representing the first Christian power in the world to-day, can wish to assist and reward these very same Jews who maltreated your Isa (Jesus).' 'We Arabs have been the traditional friends of Great Britain for many years, and I Bin Saud in particular have been your Government's firm friend all my life, what madness then is this which is leading on your Government to destroy this friendship of centuries, all for the sake of an accursed and stiffnecked race which has always bitten the hand of everyone who has helped it, since the world began.' 'It were far far preferable from every point of view, if Great Britain were to make Palestine a British Possession and rule it for the next 100 years, rather than to par tition it in the way they propose*. Such partition cannot possibly solve the difficulty but must only perpetuate it and lead to war and misery. Some people seem to think that I, Bin Saud, have an eye on Palestine myself, and would like to benefit by the disturbed state of affairs existing there, to step in and offer to take it over myself. 'That certainly would be a solution, but God forbid that this should happen, for I have enough and to spare as it is.' 'To-dayl am the 'Imam' or 'Spiritual Leader' as well as the Temporal Ruler of the greater part of Arabia. I also have not a little influence in all the great Muslim countries of the world. I am being placed^in the most difficult and most invidious of all positions by the British Government my friends. On the one hand I am beingcippsctlsd 'bo by mscins oi niypiacis oi£ iG'fc'bsps and. bGlagnams by day and night from all quarters of the Muslim world to step in and save Palestine for the Arabs. I am even urged by my own people of Najd, and all good Muslims in the outer world to break with the English and save Palestine ior its people by war. On the other hand I see that it would be utterly futile to break with my old friends the English, for to do so would bring untold woe on the world, and would be to play right into the hands of the Jews, the enemies of Arabia as well as of England.' I definitely shall not wage war against you English and I have told my people this, because I am the only man among them who can see far ahead and I know that by so doing I should lose the one potential ally I now have, ior are not Italy, Germany and Turkey (especially the latber) like ravening wolves to-day seeking whom they may devour. They are all flirting with me at the present moment, but I know they will wish to devour me later. A friendly nngland will I believe always prevent them accomplishing their ends. Hence though as a Muslim I have no particular love for any Christian European nation, political interest demands that I keep in with the best of them, that is England.' j ' T be difficulty is my Arabs and the ’Ikhwan tribes of Najd,- Over this Palestine business their senses are only in their eyes, and they cannot see one cubit ahead. They even now blame me for wavering and obeying the orders of the English, and yet your Government expects me to keep them in check. Your Government should remem ber that I am the Arab f s religious leader and so am the interpreter of the scriptures. God’s word to them cannot be got round.' 'Verily the word of God teaches us, and we imolicitly believe this 9 Dickson, that for a Muslim to kill a Jew, or for him to be killed by a Jew ensures him an immediate entry into Heaven or into the august presence of God Almighty. What more then can a Muslim want in this hard world, and this is what my people are repeatedly reminding me of? Most assuredly your Government is placing me in the same dilemma that they did in 1929—30 which ended in the ’Ikhwan going out in rebellion against me.' 'The Jews are of course your en&amp;emies as well as ours though they are cleverly making use of you now. Later your Government will see and feel their teeth. For the present they (the Jews) prefer biding their time. Perhaps your Government does not know that the Jews contemplate as their final aim not only the seizure of all Palestine but the land south of it as far as Medina.Eastward also they hope some day to extend to the Persian Gulf. They cozen certain Imperialistic minded Englishmen with stories of how a strong Jewish and Pro-British State stretching from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf will safe guard Englands communi cations with the East, saying that the Arabs are England's enemies and will always be so. At the same time they play on the minds of the sentimental British Masses, by telling them that the Old Testament Prophets foretold how they the Jews would eventually return to their Promised Land, or again that they, the persecuted and wandering Bani Israel, should not be denied a small place in the world -where to lay their weary heads. Hoy*/, 0 Dickson, would the people of Wales like it if you English suddenly gave the Jews their country? But no, it is easier to give away other peoples countries and not so dangerous.” 'That the Jews of Palestine are even now straining every nerve to cause a permanent split between the English people and the Arabs can be proved to the hilt by the recent murders of officials in Palestine. It is as clear as daylight to me that the God-less Arab gun men, hired from abroad who committed those vile deeds were hired and paid for by Jewish money. We state this to be an absolute fact, for did not the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem swear to us in the 'Haram” of Mecca by the Holy Kaaba that he would never resort to any but constitutional methods in opposing the Zionist machinations in Palestine and I believe him even to-day.” (and what 'What we fear so greatly 'Great Britain must not allow to come to pass is the turning of the Arabs of Arabia and neighbouring Arab countries into enemies of England. Once this happens then an irreparable cpime will have been committed, for as we said above Arabs vri.ll never forget an injury, and will bide their opportunity to take revenge for a hundred years if need be. Enemies of England would not be slow to take advantage of this, and an England in difficulties, or engaged elsewhere in war v/ould then be the signal for the Arabs to act.' ; 'The very thought of the above happening is hateful to me Abdul Aziz, yet be assured that Partition in Palestine will bring this about in spite of all your mis directed efforts. And after all I cannot help you for ever as I can not live more than a few years more. I repeat then that the only solution that I can see is for your Govern ment to rule Palestine herself. The Zionists of course will not like this, but their views must not be asked« The Arabs will agree to this solution and those who do not must be made to agree by such people as myself.The main thing at all costs is to prevent the Jews having an independant state of their own sliced out of Arab territory with no one to guide their future acts and policy. For from such will come a perpetual struggle with the Arabs living round them. Firstly, because the Jews determined to expand, will intrigue from the very beginning and not rest till they have created discord and enmity between Great Britain and us Arabs, out of which they will hope to benefit: Secondly, they having the money will create a highly effective though perhaps small mechanized Army and Air Force, which they will assuredly use one day for aggressive purposes against the Arabs, seeing that their aim is the whole of Palestine Trans-Jordan and their old stronghold Madina—The land they went to when driven out of Palestine and dispersed after the Romans destroyed Jerusalem. On top of this your Government must at once further restrict all further imigration of Jews into Palestine leaving alone those already there, but allowing no more to come in.” I here took advantage of a pause in the King’s rather forcible harangue to try and explain His Majesty’s Government’s point of view on the lines suggested by Rend£4 when I saw him recently in London. But before I had gone very far the King in vigorous fashion checked and rather overwhelmed me with the words, 'By God, your Government has no point of view, except the willful committing of an injustice. Every God - fearing man be he Muslim or Christian knows that it cannot be right to do a wrong, however cleverly the committing may be served up to the people. If I, an ignorant Badawin Arab of Arabia can see, as clearly as I see the sun rise, that the proposed partition of Palestine is wicked and wrong in God’s sight, surely the more clever western Politicians, if they fear God at all, can see this also. Thank God I believe in God and his One-ness, and I know that it is this very belief of mine that makes me see things as clearly as I do. I am as firmly convinced that I am right, and that God has opened my eyes to the right, as I believe that God will punish me if I lie to him. Therefore there is no other side to this question except it be bargaining with Satan.' The King here seemed suddenly to tire as if the effort of speaking for so long had been too much for him, so after calling on the Editor of the Radio Bulletin to read out the latest Radio news from all over the world to the seated assembly, he dismissed me kindly but firmly. After leaving the King’s presence, a messenger stopped me in the corridor saying that the Amir Saud would like me to call on him in his Mijliss. I found the Heir Apparent holding court amidst a gather ing of many Badawin Shaikhs and others. He received me graciously, and asked me to dine with him on Wednesday27th October. No questions of a contentious nature were mentioned and Palestine was avoided. He talked much about his recent visit to England and the kindness he had received on all sides. He thought fit to mention that what had impressed him most was (a) ^ The wonderful, affection the English people had for their King and Royal Family, and (b) The inate sense of lav/ and order which he found everywhere among the English people. He instanced the remarkable love of English people for ’’queuing” up outside theatres, stations etc. etc. This he thought very amusing. That^night Fuad Hamza came and dined with me at the Budaiyah Palace, and over coffee afterwards he asked me if I knew^ anything of the troubles between Bahrain and Qatar, which he rather gratuitously said could never have happened in^the great days of Sir Percy Gox. I said I knew nothing of such trouble. He then turned to the Palestine problem and gave it as his opinion, (almost as if he were continuing the King’s talk by order), that the immediate need in Palestine was for Great Britain to drop all questions of partition and run the country herself. This would give renewed confidence and a breathing space. On top of this England should at once,he said, restrict further immigration of the Jews, until some such scheme as keeping the present percentage of Arab and Jewish population forever unchanged, were v/orked out. ,J -0 draw Fuad Hamza out further I myself suggested what I thought a better alternative, but made it clear that it was entirely a personal idea of mine, formed as a result of my having lived in Jerusalem as a youngster, and seen how the Turks faced the same problem, for they as far beck as 1892 had feared the return of the Jews to Palestine, and the swamping of themselves and the Arab population, and so had passed a lav/ that no European Jew could stay in the country for mere than two months at a time. I suggested on the above analogy that all Jews to-dsy settled in Palestine should be allowed to remain there for good, but that further settlement of Jews in the_country be entirely forbidden. At the same time Palestine should be thrown open to any Jew who liked to visit it as a pilgrim, provided he left the country after a two months sojourn. In other words two months visas only to be given to Jews the world over by British Consular Authorities. This I said would work out rather like Muslims doing the Haj to Mecca. They could come as often as they liked but could not settle except in very extraordinary circumstances. Fuad Hamza said my suggestion was quite a good one, and had a lot to be said for it, but changed the subject rather abruptly, as though he felt he ought not to discuss a dangerous subject further with a person having- no official status.Second audience. This took place on the 27th October. His Majesty the King sent for me about 10.30 a.m., hearing that I was in the Town looking round the Bazaars. I found him seated in the same Council Hall where I had first met him, and after preliminary greetings and after asking after Mrs. Dickson's and my health, he enquired if I had seen the old city of Dhara'iyeh. In my replying in the affirmative he very graciously said that I could go anywhere and everywhere in his capital and photograph what I wanted. 'You are one of us 0 Dickson and you are free to do what you like in our country, coming and going when you like”. When I thanked him for his words he said again, u As you no doubt will want to go to Hoffuf and Qatif from Riyadh and see the oil wells there, I have telegraphed to Ibn Jiluwi and told him to make necessary arrangements'. I had some difficulty in explaining that I could not manage the visit, as I had a limited number of days leave only. Next, the worlds Radio News was read out in Arabic for my benefit, and I took my leave. Third Audienc e . This took place on the morning of 28th October, and was really in the nature of a 'leave taking'. Mrs Dickson and I had already witnessed a great 'Ardha' or war dance, lasting from 7 a.m. till 11a.m. in the great square in front of the Palace; my wife from the Royal Ladies quarters where she sat with the King's sister Nura and Princesses, and I from a seat near the entrance to the Palace on the ground floor, where Fuad Hamza looked after me. The King’s sons led by the Amir Saud had all danced for close on two hours, and so had the King for a short fifteen minutes, so Fuad Hamza and I, sensing that the 'Ardha' was nearly over, repaired to the formers office in the Palace. As we sat there drinking coffee the King suddenly appeared alone, and somewhat hot and breathless as a result of his dancing efforts. After resting a few minutes, he told me he had heard I was leaving that afternoon, and had come purposely to say goodbye. He recounted laughingly how he had met Mrs Dickson in his sister's Palace, and that both his sister and he had tried to make her a good Musilma, but that she had hesitated because according to her she feared that you 0 Dickson would follow suit and marry three other wives. He also recounted laughing heartily all the while, how Mrs. Dickson had told his sister that if ever I (Col. Dickson) divorced her she was going to come to Riyadh and settle down with his sister Nura in the Shamsiyah Palace. His Majesty, having made this little jest, again reverted to the inevitable Palestine question, and in a half hours talk, recapitulated all the arguments and points that he had previously made, this time with more than marked earnestness. He appeared genuinely obsessed with the danger that existed of a Pan Arab split with the English: 'Your Government is digging an enormouschasm between themselves and us Arabs which wall engulf both of us shortly if they do not cease digging” were his words. 'There still remains a small bridge over this chasm', he continued,'but further digging will cause this to crash, and then that will be the end of all Arab friendship with England. Can nothing persuade your Government to pause?' The King then went on to relate how that the Turks once were a great race and knew how to treat the great Arab Princes of Arabia with consideration and honour. They not only took their advice, but gave them great titles and rewards. Those were the days when 'Turkey had great men in charge of her destinies. In these later days the Turks had failed to produce those self same great men, and they had failed to retain Arabia, or even the Arabs respect. In the downward path, he went on, everywhere bad officials had appeared, who had gone out of their way to harm their Central Government's prestige and good name. What was the result, Turkey crashed, weakened from within, and entirely owing to the fault of her miserable provincial officials; men who played for their own hand only, and cared not what harm they did so long as they could earn cheap promotion. Your Government to-day, opined the King, was going much the same way as the Turks did of old. * Your officials in important localities were following in the footsteps of the later day Turks, and were not doing their duty by the Central Government. for a 100 years. 'Shaikh Isa' , said the King,'was the Father not only of the Persian Gulf, but of the whole of Arabia, ve Arabs, and especially I and my house looked upon him with the greatest affection and love - we even would have died for him had he raised his little finger and asked our help. What happened? He was thrust out of his little kingdom, an old weary man of 90 years old, and he died dishonoured and heartbroken. All for what - to please the personal ambition of a young officer called Major Daly; an English man of no family (sharaf) who cared nothing for the harm he was doing to his I snatched the opportunity to thank His Majesty for all his hospitality and kindness to myself and my wife, and respectfully took my leave. The King’s last act was to have Reuters telegrams read over to him in my presence. 'I live on the wireless news these days' he said, 'for world affairs are reaching b crisis everywhere, and I must keep touch.' I then left His Majesty's presence, and two hours later bade farewell to Riyadh city. / He here instanced the deposition of Shaikh Isa of Bahrain by Major Daly*some years ago, and said that that act had done more to harm England in Arabia than any other OUOIi UilJLii.&amp;iD £XL1UU-LU. iXU O UO CXJ-J-U VVCU. p AA UJ J V U.J. Government, they should choose their officials better'. That was why, he continued, he asked that his Majesty’s Government should send him specially selected officers to visit him from time to time to hear what he ha4 to say 'min al ras illal Ras,(from my head to their head direct)'. After some further diatribes against Major Daly and certain other British officials who need not be mentioned, Government. Such things should not be allowed to happen by yourComments. My private reactions to all I saw and heard in Riyadh may be summed up as follows and I give them for what they are worth. (a) While the people of Saudi Arabia and especially the i religious leaders are manifestly in greatly excited condition over the Palestine question, the King is definitely n on top”, and can and will keep his people in hand. (b) The King, though himself indignant and distressed at the trend of policy in Palestine, and especially at the'partition scheme' - is determined not to jeopardize the friendly relations existing between His Majesty f s Government and himself. Hence he will make no move at all of an Anti British nature in Arabia, beyond giving advice and offering suggestions. (c; His policy of remaining neutral is however definitely going to harm his(the King’s) prestige in Arabia, and he sees this. If His Majesty’s Government could therefore grant the King some sort of 'quid procquo' for standing aloof in the present crisis, something which would be of immediate benefit to the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsular proper, and which could be seen and appreciated by all his people; I think that His Majesty’s Government would be wise to grant such to him. He will have his own way of explaining such gift to his subjects, and a less hostile atmosphere among the Arabs will I think follow. Any quid pro quo must however err on the very generous * side, anything niggardly will spoil alio I i!</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000248_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/245</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000248</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/245</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 1115/1938 'Col.
