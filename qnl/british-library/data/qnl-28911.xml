Necessity of continued payment of subsidy to Ibn Saud on conditions proposed as a means of retaining his good will and of securing his acquiescence in potential Sheriffian policy for Mesopotamia was recognised by Committee. They considered however figure agreed upon at Cairo viz: £100,000 a year to be unduly high and were not satisfied that desired object could not be obtained without so substantial an increase of present subsidy. It was pointed out that amount paid to late Amir of Afghanistan for much more important services did not exceed by much the amount proposed for Ibn. Saud. The fear was expressed that by fixing figure so high we should set an awkward precedent which would be bound to embarrass us hereaf :er as it was argued that amount fixed for Ibn S.aud will inevitably set a standard by which future subsidies to other Arab Chiefs will be judged. Committee came to conclusion that present subsidy of £60,000 ought not to he increased; they were however prepared in the special circumstances to sanction a cash grant of £20,000 uO Ibn 3aud 11 Office telegramXon o&amp;ud o?«r and above his subsidy- ?he view taken was that this grant t^sothar with rac option of his title m Multan of Nejd would afford an adeouat* Subject to any co manta you raay have to after you are authorised to coronunicate these conclusions to Ibn baud's eloption*.The precis© time and iaethod of miking the offer i leave to your discretion.

The incidence of the cost has not yet been finally settled. The subsidy is continuing to be paid on the conditions which Ibn Saud has accepted, that he will meet King Hussein with a view to reconciling their differences, will not disturb the existing state of affairs till the meeting has taken place, and will guarantee the good behaviour of his followers during the pilgrimage. To the last part of the question I can give no answer at present. Mr QRMSBY-GQRS: Can the right fion.

Sib, We have the honour to invite a reference to your telegram of the 4th January 1917 in which you sanctioned the proposal made hy the Government of India in, their telegram, No. 980-S., dated the 7th December 1916, for the payment of a subsidy of £5,000 a month to His Excellency Amir Sir Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman bin Paisal-as-Saud, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Nejd. The payment has hitherto been made in rupees or currency notes at the rate of Is. 4d. the rupee, and the question has now been raised whether the rupee equivalent should not be calculated at the current rates of exchange. As regards the future, we have decided that the most convenient course is to make the payment m sovereigns; in which case the question of exchange does not arise, and have issued instructions accordingly. It is not practicabld to re-adjust the payments already made in rupee currency at the rate of Is. 4d. the rupee, and even if it were practicable, we see objections to a payment of this character being varied with reference to the course of exchange. We propose accordingly not to re-open the question of exchange in respect of past payments, and report our action for your information. We have the honour to be.

P813/41 3000 4-19 WB&amp;L (60780) P534/25 5000 7-19 The facts are:- An Army of Occupation which collects taxes is *entibled, after defraying the expenses of the Administration 'to the same extent as the National Government had been bound', to apply any surplusto its own needs. Such taxes must be collected in accordance with the fiscal law of the Enemy territory (ii) -If therefore Mesopotamia were to be considered Conquered Enemy Country the Treasury would undoubtedly be entitled to. claim any surplus. (iii) But His Majesty's Government have proclaimed Mesopotamia to be a 'liberated', and presumably friendly country: and can thereto re- scarce ly justify the application of this rule of war: (iv) Nevertheless they are undoubtedly entitled to set against the revenues of the New State all normal expenditure and to satisfy themselves that the 'surplus' genuinely exists after these claims have been met* W) pus claim does not appear to betenable. The function of Administration 1 is in the hands of the General Officer Commanding^and a share - an ever increasing share - therein has been handed over to the cnarge of the Civil Commissioner. The Civil Commissioner has never been entirely responsible. The expenses of f normal administration* must include at least the charges of defence on a peace footing; but Sir A. Wilson proposes to recover from the Military payment for duties performed by his Civil Levies. Charges which have not been met by the Civil Commissioner’s budget may be classified as:- (D(1) Ascertainable - (2) not ascertainable - Under (1) falls all the charges for definite works of public utility - bridges, dockyards etc. etc. which will be taken over at a valuation (vide Hewett - ^ * &lt; . report). (2) includes such proportion of expenditure as would normally have been defrayed from the purse of the State on departments which, for reasons of the campaign, were inaugurated as Military. In the early days Baghdad was policed by the Military; and departments e.g. Agriculture and irrigation/, were financed by the Military. A proportion of these expenses were such as would not be ’normal // expenditure* of the Administration; but though it would be practically impossible to say exactly , ' , to wnat proportion should be debited/either account, it is certain that a proportion would be ’normal* and therefore debitable to Civil. (6) To recoup itself for these disbursements, both ascertainable and unascertainable, the Treasury have had this surplus of'one million only; and half of this has already been allotted to Capital Expenditure on Railways. We are therefore dealing with one iialf million only. As regards this the Treasury position seems to be that (a) Under a strict interpretation of the rules of war His Majesty’s Government are entitled to dispose of any surplus: and (b) even the Arabs could not object to their claiming this particular’surplus* as against disbursements made on their behalf; the sum of which will far exceed available assets. Accordingly they propose to appropriate this balance: which will thus become their property. If they do recovern Minute Paper. Department. recover this sura then they are prepared to accept the I ^ claim for repayment of Bin gaud’s subsidy: which they will adjust against this windfall. (7) This is a very different thing from saying that Bin Baud’s subsidy should be met from Mesopotamian revenues, as is suggested by Foreign Office: and we snoul d, it is submitted, protest against any such interpretation of the facts. The subsidy to Bin Baud was initially as much a war expenditure as^he cost of any other military operations against the enemy financed but not executed by Great Britain. The suggestion therefore that the ForeignoOffice should be refunded the £18,000 odd which has been paid under foimal Treasury sanction may be resisted? (8) . As regards Sir A. Wilson’s protest that the Treasury should have none of this money, we are on more difficult ground. There is no doubt but that, to whatever extent Treasury participation in Middle East Conferences can be held to justify expenditure incurred, formal sanction to Bin Baud’s subsidy for a longer period than six months was never obtained: nor that, later still, Sir A. Wilson failed to have carried ' into effect definite orders to reduce the subsidy. His excuse that the telegram to Bahrain conveying this instruction was not delivered will not bear very close examination. It would suffice for one, or even two, overpayments, but his Audit^depafew department should have seen to it that overpayments did not continue long er. We have therefore to ask some indulgence from the Treasury and cannot press them overmuch* The Treasury seem to sayj 'We see your difficulty: but we have likewise ours. There is literally no sum, except this (% ) (68860) Wt. P813/41 3000 4-1 against which we can debit this expenditure, (69780) P534/25 5000 7-19 x butbut this we are prepared to do. Do you agree?' (9). At the India Office meeting of April 17th I was careful not to commit the India Office at all. The Conference considered only the technical point; and I ha.ve to confess that when the proposition to spend the Mesopotamian surplus was sprung on me the distinction between Mesopotamia, the province of conquered Turkey and Mesopotamia, the'liberited country, escaped me. This note is my locus aoenitejiysg: and I suggest that a satisfactory solution would be to acquiesce in payment of Bin Baud's subsidy from ’surplus( provided that this surplus is credit ed to Mesopotamia on capital account. His Majesty's Government will then be spending not Mesopotamian money but their own acquired for consideration passed 4- 1 think (from a conversation with Mr. Craig) Treasury will agree. (10). Action proposed ,is therefore\ { r-'- \j 1Draft Paper Department The Under Secretary of State ^ Foreign Office, S.W.l. ^ am directed by the Secretary of Sir State for India to acknowledge re ceipt of your letter of 26th April Ho. E.3524/678/44 relative to the subsidy paid to Ibn Saud. 2 . It is observed that the Treasury letter enclosed therewith was written before the receipt of my letters of April 8 th, Ho.1885 and April 29th, Ho. P.3124, in which the circumstances relating to the overpayments to Ibn Saud were explained and I am to enquire whether further information in this respect is still required by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. 3. As to the incidence of the expenditure on account of the subsidy, I am to enclose for the information of tte Earl Curzon of Kedleston copy subject. It will be seen that Sir A. Wilson protests against payment to Ibn Saud being made from surpluses accrued during active operations. 4. In this connection, and with reference to my letter P.2879 of the 29th April, I am to explain more To Baghdad dated 20th May, 1920 From ' Ho. 6398 28th/ ' ,T of the marginally noted telegraphic correspondence exchanged with the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad^ on this 10 521—1 5000 12/19 ful 1 y Mr• Montagu 1 s view of the positionposition. He realises that under the rules of war an Army of Occupation in Snemy Territory is entitled to apply to its own usesy revenues received in excess of the sum required to maintain the normal administration of the Territory occupied. But the occupied area in Mesopotamia has from the first been regarded, not as conquered, but as I liberated territory; and Mr, Secretary Montagu presumes that there is no s^SS^stion that His Majesty T s Government should claim to appropriate to their own use, by right of conquest, the accrued surpluses now held by the Treasury. The position as he under stands it is that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are to be regarded as holding the surpluses against the claims of the British Exchequer for reimburse ment of expenditure incurred. Mr. Montagu sees no objection, provided that the sum in question is retained to the credit of Mesopotamia for the purposes of fubure adjustment, to its being regarded by anticipation^ as Ijaasag^for present practical purposes i at the disposal of His Majesty^ Government.

Patrick, Foreign Office (Secretary). SUBSIDY TO IBN SAUD. Mr. Garbett, referring to the proposal to debit Ibn Saud’s subsidy against Mesopotamian revenues, enquired whether the reference was to current revenues or to accrued surplus. Mr. Phillips stated that the Treasury’s suggestion referred to the accrued surplus, and asked whether the India Office would object to the 265,000Z. already paid to Ibn Saud being adjusted against that amount. Mr. Garbett agreed that under the accepted laws of war surplus revenues of occupied enemy territory were at the disposal of the occupying Power. In this way the surplus Mesopotamian revenues were at the disposal of His Majesty’s Government, and the India Office would probably agree to their being used to meet the amount of Ibn Saud’s subsidy already paid. After some discussion, Mr. Phillips said there were no other funds at present available in the Treasury to meet this expenditure, and he agreed that the Treasury might also accept this suggestion, which, in fact, they were putting to the Foreign Office officially. Mr. Montgomery raised the question as to whether the 265,000L was reckoned in sterling or rupees. Mr. Garbett understood it was the former. Major Young asked whether, if the past subsidy was to be met from the Mesopotamian surplus, the subsidy could not now continue to be paid till the signature of peace from current Mesopotamian revenues. Mr. Phillips asked whether it was a matter of urgent necessity to continue the subsidy at all. Mr. Garbett said that the India Office considered that there could not be a more inopportune moment for reconsidering these subsidies than the present. The India Office considered that Ibn Saud’s subsidy should certainly be continued till his meeting with King Hussein had taken place. He thought it probable that the India Office would agree to Ibn Saud’s subsidy being adjusted against the Mesopotamian accounts till the signature of peace. Mr. Phillips, while adhering to the view that Ibn Saud’s subsidy should be met from Mesopotamian revenues, asked whether it could not, in fact, be assumed that there would in future be no real Mesopotamian surplus, and that His Majesty’s Govern ment would, in practice, have to pay anyway if the subsidy were continued. 61 [2967]Mr. Garhett pointed out that in any case we could not engage in advance the future Mesopotamian Government. Sir John Tilley agreed that the most suitable occasion for reconsidering this subsidy would be the signature of peace with Turkey. The Meeting was of opinion that, subject to India Office and Treasury concurrence, the 265,000h already paid as subsidy to Ibn Saud should be met from the Mesopotamian surplus, and that Ibn Saud’s subsidy should continue to be paid till the signature of peace from current Mesopotamian revenue^. FUTURE POLICY AS TO SUBSIDIES. Major Young observed that His Majesty’s Government were endeavouring to obtain a ££ self-denying ordinance” from other Powers as regards Arabia. They were asking for a special position in the Peninsula on account of its proximity to the Empire’s vital maritime routes. The question was whether we could maintain that position without expenditure in the shape of subsidies. India and His Majesty’s Government had felt up to now that their interests justified the payment of certain subsidies, and if, as a result of the Peace Treaty, His Majesty’s Government were to be given a special position in the Peninsula, the case for continuing them would, if anything, be strengthened. Sir John Tilley concurred. In reply to a question by Mr. Phillips, Major Young considered that the appoint ment of the Britist-Moslem representative at Mecca was an exactly parallel case and amounted to an acknowledgment by the Treasury of the principle of His Majesty’s Government’s interests in the pilgrimage question. (Mr. Phillips dissented.) The whole question of subsidies in the Peninsula was, moreover, inextricably involved as regards the various rulers. The relations of His Majesty’s Government with Hussein, Ibn Saud and the Idrisi, for example, were mutually interdependent. Mr. Phillips suggested that in spite of this it might be possible and more satisfactory for His Majesty’s Government to back one ruler only. Major Young agreed that this seemed more likely to be successful at first sight, but pointed out that the Eastern Committee had discussed the question on various occasions and had failed to arrive at a decision to concentrate on one subsidy. The treasury had been represented at all these discussions. Mr. Garbelt added that the question was not only one of maintaining our special position in Arabia but went a good deal further. We were the greatest Moslem Power in the world, and it was of the highest importance to the interests of the Empire as a whole that the pilgrim routes should be kept open. Failing this, unrest in all colonies containing Moslems would ensue. He considered that subsidies should take, in the future, the less offensive form of payments for services rendered, i.e., services in connection with keeping open the pilgrim routes. He suggested also that a ratio might be observed in fixing the amount of the various subsidies- in the same way as had been done by Colonel Wilson, who had suggested fixing Rashid’s subsidy at half Ibn feaud s. Mr. Phillips enquired how many British subjects actually used the pilgrim routes, ■ and suggested that if we kept one route open—by sea—we were really meeting our responsibilities in the matter. &amp; Major 1 oung pointed out that it was not so much a question of the routes as of the actual security of the holy places themselves—Mecca and Medina. Mr. Phillips asked what the probable result would be if all the subsidies were withdrawn { Mr. Garbett considered that this would in all probability lead to the closino* of the pi grim routes and thus to general unrest, not only in Arabia but in India and in our other Moslem dependencies, as well as m those of other Powers. Major ^} oung observed that a revival of Turcophil propaganda might also ensue Moreover, m the event of a Wahabi invasion of the Hedjaz, causing dissatisfaction3 i •““ h d, ®' u,lI »«* f— p-t- A discussion on the subsidies to Ibn Saud and Hussein followed. ■ . 01 A that Ibn Saud might be unwilling to receive subsidies uom i( U a m the event of the latter becoming ruler of Mesopotamia. Such a subsidy wouk , in fact, amount to blackmail on Ibn Sand’s part. He agreed, however, that in any case i wou c e better if this subsidy took the form of a payment for services i. en ere m ' ee P m g open the pilgrim routes. His demands would probably increase as time went on. 1 Phillips enquired whether we should be responsible for the defence of Abdulla — orot Mesopotamia under the Peace Treaty. k&gt;L~u&gt;-u to+Tps**** Major Voting thought that this would probably be the case. Mr. Carr asked whether Ibn Saud did not in actual fact use his subsidy for warlike preparations against the Hedjaz. If this was the case, did it really tend to peace to continue to pay it ? Major Young suggested, in this connection, that Ibn Saud might be given to understand that his subsidy was conditional on his not attacking the Hedjaz. He observed that, under the Treaty, the Hedjaz would be independent, and that it would be very difficult for any one Power to pay a direct subsidy to Hussein. Some form of subsidy might possibly be paid by us in conjunction with other Powers interested in the pilgrimage. This would perhaps ultimately take the form of a loan. It would, in his opinion,* be preferable for Arab rulers to receive assistance by being encouraged to invest their money in British concerns rather than by being subsidised, but they had little money available for this purpose. King Hussein could, however, in all probability, raise money on his oil-bearing and mineral areas if he was guaranteed from aggression by the people of Nejd. Sir John Tilley observed that Hussein’s subsidy would thus actually take the form of a subsidy to Ibn Saud to induce the latter not to attack the Hedjaz. Mr. Phillips pointed out that Hussein might not appreciate this point of view, and in any case it appeared that we had continued to pay Ibn Saud when he did attack the Hedjaz. He doubted the deterrent effect of such a subsidy on Ibn Saud. Mr. Garhett stated that the India Office did not contemplate stopping Ibn Baud’s subsidy for the present. Hecent reports indicated that Ibn Saud must have money ; if not provided therewith there was a danger lest he might go and take it, which he was well able to do. In spite of his power in this respect, Ibn Saud was anxious to fall in with His Majesty’s Government’s wishes, and he regarded the subsidy as the outward sign of their favourable disposition towards him. Mr. Montgomery said that the subsidy appeared to have been efficacious in preventing Ibn Saud from attacking the Hedjaz up till now. Mr. Garbett observed that it was agreed that it would be a very difficult matter to stop all these payments at once, and that it was admittedly to the interests of the Empire as a whole to keep the pilgrimage routes open. The only methods of doing this were by subsidy, a blockade or a military campaign. He thought the subsidy was probably the cheapest of the three alternatives. Major Young agreed, and instanced the case of the Imam of Sanaa, who had now invaded the Aden Protectorate. It might eventually prove cheaper to induce him to withdraw by payment of a subsidy t han to evict him by military action. Mr. Phillips observed that the Treasury were not yet convinced of the necessity nor the continuance of the subsidies. The question of subsidy to the chiefs of the Persian Gulf was oriefly discussed. Mr. Garbett said that the India Office might possibly want the whole question of the Persian Gulf subsidies reconsidered, but that they did not at present contemp ate the withdrawal of the subsidy from Muscat or Bahrein. I he question of the with drawal of the lease of Bunder Shwaikh from the Sheikh of Koweit and oi tb^r M lli il substitution of a subsidy paid in arrear was under consideration. It might be paid either by Mesopotamia, or by India as heretofore. Mr. Phillips said that the most important question at the moment appeared to he the subsidy to Ibn Saud. In this matter the Treasury preferred to await definite^ information as to the continuance or otherwise of the subsidy to Hussein before comin g to a decision. An official letter was, however, on its way from the Treasury to the India Office and the Foreign Office on the subject of the continuance of all these subsidies, and the Treasury would be glad to learn the views of the Foreign Office and India Office on this question, not only as regards the period up to the signature of peace, but also afterwards. : IIARTICLE 48 .

L. 2AR3T0WBRITISH COMMITMENTS TO BIN SAUD. -tfo 1 BIN SAUD 18 th f hereditary ruler of the Wahabi State of Nejd (capital Er-Riadh). I' 7 m the nin eteen th century his ancestors, under the impetus of the Puritanical reli gious movement o w ich they were the champions, spread their power widely over the surrounding tribes and oases, and ruled for a moment from the Persian Gulf to the e k ea. a e fin t e century they suffered adversity. Their power was broken by Mehemet Ah. The hegemony of Central Arabia passed to the rival Bin Rashid house ot Jebel Shammar (capital Hail), and in 1871 the Turks planted garrisons in the al-Hasa province, along the Gulf Coast between Koweit and al-Katar. ^ The Bin Sand powei was con ne to the interior, and during this period there was practically no contact between it and His Majesty’s Government. T ]\ e , slt ! la A t ^ n ^ 8 radically altered, however, by two events in 1913. In May that year Abd-ul-Aziz Bin Saud, the reigning prince of that house, expelled the Turkish garrisons from Hasa and reoccupied^ the coast. And on the 29th July His Maiestv’s overnmen signe a^ Convention with Turkey, in which they recognised as belonging t0 n P t j :0man kanjak of Nejd ” the coastline and interior west of a line drawn north and south from a point on the mainland opposite Zakhnuniyah Island (Gulf of Bahrein) to latitude 20 m the Ruba-al-Khali desert (Article 11 ). ' 0 . T ^! s conjunction of events placed His Majesty’s Government in a difficult position, bmce Bm baud had become not merely the ruler of a section of the Gulf Coast, but the most powerful of all the local rulers, R was inevitable that His Majesty’s Government should have direct relations with him over the arms traffic, British trade, and his dealings with neighbouring Arab States (Koweit, Katar, Trucial Chiefs, &amp;c.) already in treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. On the other hand, Bin Saud’s de /octo independence in Hasa was not recognised by Turkey, and we had agreed with the Turkish Government to regard his coast and country as Turkish territory, and himself, by implication, as a Turkish subject. n ir 0 ? th r? . ins t ri i ctl0ns of Sir P * Vox, at that time British Resident in the Persian Gulf, the British Residents at Koweit (Captain Shakespear) and Bahrein met Bin Saud on the 15th and 16th December, 1913. At this meeting Bin Saud invited His Majesty’s Government to keep the peace on his coast, showed the British representatives the draft agreement which the Turks were trying to make him accept, and practically asked for British mediation (6117/1990/14). The Turkish conditions communicated to us by Bin Saud were as follows :— 1 . The readmission of the Turkish garrisons to the province and coast of Hasa, as formerly. 2 . The appointment of Kazis and other judicial officers by direct ££ farmans” issued by the Sultan. 3. The payment by Bin Saud of annual revenue of £T. 3 , 000 . 4. The reference of all communications from foreign Powers or their representatives to the Turkish authorities for disposal. 5. The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents from the province. 6 . An undertaking from Bin Saud not to give concessions to any foreign companies for railways or motor-car services. On the 9th March, 1914, the Foreign Office presented a memorandum to Hakki Pasha, who was at that time conducting negotiations in London on behalf of the Turkish Government, in which the difficulty of His Majesty’s Government’s position in regard to Bin Saud was explained, the Turkish conditions cited (without the source of our information being stated), and a protest made against the last three of them (10569/14). In this memorandum British desiderata in regard to Bin Saud, subject, of course, to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, were defined as follows :— 1 . That he should not meddle in the territory or politics of Arab principalities in the Gulf, including Trucial Coast and Katar. [939] B2 . That, like other Sheikhs on the Arab side of the Gulf, he should co-opera .e for the observation and maintenance of the maritime truce, i.e., the suppression of piracy and the pursuit of inter-tribal hostilities by the passage of armed dhows at sea. 3 . That he should co-operate for the suppression of the arms traffic. A 4 . That British traders should be freely admitted to Katif and properly treated while there. Meanwhile, negotiations between the Turks and Bin Saud proceeded, and resulted in a treaty signed by Bin Saud and the Vali of Basra on the 15th May, 1914 (236112/4650/16). The terms of this treaty may be summarised here :— Article 1. —Signatories’names ; secrecy; validity. Article 2.—The vilayet of Nejd to remain in charge of Abd-ul-Aziz Pasha al-Saud for life. His descendants to succeed by Imperial firman, “ provided he remains loyal to the Imperial Government.” Article 3.—A “ technical military official ” (? euphemism for Turkish resident) to be appointed by Bin Saud, to live wherever he (Bin Saud) wishes. Turkish military instructors to be employed by Bin Saud at his discretion. Article 4.—(Turkish) soldiers and gendarmerie to be posted, at Bin Saud’s discretion, in sea ports. Article 5.—Customs, taxes, ports, lighthouses, to be administered by Bin Saud according to Ottoman regulations. Article 6 .—Deficiency of local revenues to be met out of customs, ports, telegraphs and posts revenue. Any surplus in this imperial revenue, and 10 per cent, of any surplus in local revenues, to be remitted to Constantinople. Article 7.—Turkish flag to be flown on buildings and shipping. Article 8 .—Correspondence regarding supply of arms to be conducted with Marine Department at Constantinople. Article 9.—“ The said Vali and Commandant (7e., Bin Saud) is not allowed to interfere with or correspond about foreign affairs and international treaties, or to grant concessions to foreigners.” Article 10.—Bin Saud to correspond direct with Ministries of Interior and Marine at Constantinople. Article 11.—Post offices to be established in vilayet of Nejd. Stamps to be Turkish. Article 12.—In case of internal disturbance in Turkey, or war between Turkey and a foreign Power, “if the Government asks the said Vali for a force to co-operate with its own forces, it is incumbent on the Vali to prepare a sufficient force with provisions and ammunition, and to respond to the demand at once, according to his power and ability.” During the course of these negotiations between Bin Saud and Turkey, and, in fact, during the whole period between the signing of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, and the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey on the 31st October, 1914, His Majesty’s Government discouraged Bin Saud’s advances to them, and did their utmost to comply with the spirit of the Convention. During the interval between the beginning of the war in Europe and the inter vention of Turkey, when the attitude of the Turkish Government was becoming more and more hostile to the Allies, rumours reached His Majesty’s Government that Bin Saud was preparing to throw in his lot with the Turks. The Turks did, in fact, attempt to reconcile Bin Saud and Bin Rashid, and secure their military co-operation on the Turkish side. But Bin Saud evaded these overtures (84042/46261/14 and 17000/1385/15 : No. 48). In October 1914 the Sheikh of Koweit wrote to him on his own initiative, stating that he proposed to stand by His Majesty’s Government himself, and that he advised him to do the same (59746/46261/14). And Bin Saud wrote back that “ in the event of war with Turkey he would stand by the Sheikh and the British Government” (63562/14). The earlier rumours that Bin Saud was inclining towards the Turks, and the importance, in the event of war with Turkey, of securing his friendship, had already decided the India Office to send Captain Shakespear, formerly British Resident at Koweit, on a special mission to Bin Saud (59038/46261/14). On the 4th October, 1914, the Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed to inform Bin Saud of this intention through the Sheikh of Koweit; and on the 8 th October, 1914, instructions were sent tott* i\T C ^ r °l , 01 ' U1 ^ er communication (also to be made through Koweit) explaining: . is i ajesA s rovemments attitude towards Turkey, and asking Bin Baud to help em o cep e peace in Arabia in the event of Turkish aggression leading to waiv ihree Aralnc letters were accordingly drafted at Koweit, one by the British Besident ^ in l ?*j 1 Sheikh (82216/14), in which Bin Sand was addressed in the sense ot the India Uliice instructions and was informed of Captain Shakespear’s mission. eS Q n erS weie despatched on the 15th October, 1914. In answer to them, baud wrote letters on the 24th October, 1914, to the Political Resident in the Gulf . °i Shakespear himself. The letter to Captain Shakespear was conveyed lougi Bin bauds lieutenant on the Hasa coast, and the latter was instructed to a mee t m g for him with Captain Shakespear when that officer arrived (5353/1385/15). r Meanwhile, on the 14th September, 1914, the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had submitted to the Government of India drafts of letters and notices to t e dilfeient Gulf Chiefs, which he had prepared for the event of war between . re Tf? Britain and Turkey, and which he proposed to issue upon the receipt of intelligence that war had broken out (64214/61439/14). The draft letter to Bin baud (which was to follow a brief circular announcing that a state of war existed between Great Britain and Turkey) ran as follows :— cc In continuation of my previous letter, informing your Excellency of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey, I am authorised by my Government to request your Excellency to co-operate with our honoured friends, their Excellencies the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, in the capture or Basrah from the Turks or, should such a task be beyond your united powers, which seems unlikely, that you should make such arrangements, especially above Gurnah, as may prevent assistance reaching Basrah, until such time as the British arrive and take over the city. Consistently with your main object, viz., the capture or isolation of Basrah, we request your Excellency to take all measures in your power to prevent the plundering of British merchants and property in the town of Basrah itself and in the neighbourhood. The personal safety of the Europeans should also be a special object of your solicitude. t£ In return for this valuable co-operation, I am authorised by my Government to assure your Excellency that, in the event of our success—and succeed we shall, insha Allah—Basrah will never again be allowed to be subject to Turkish authority. “ I am further to assure your Excellency that the British Government will guarantee your Excellency— “ 1 . Against all reprisals by the Turks in consequence of these measures ; “ 2. Against attack by sea ; and £&lt; 3. That they will be prepared to recognise your Excellency as independent Ruler of Nejd and al-Hasa, and to enter into treaty relations with your Excellency. ££ I am also directed to request your Excellency to turn the Turkish garrisons of al-Hasa and al-Qatif out of your territory.” This draft v/as approved in due course by the Government of India and the India Office, and the letter seems to have been released for delivery on the 3 rd November, 1914 (82713/61439/14 : pp. 7—8, 15-6, and 17). The three assurances contained in it became the basis of the subsequent negotiations. Bin Baud’s reply, dated the 28th November, 1914 (17000/1385/15 : No. 46) was phrased as follows : — “We have received your august communication dated the 3rd November, 1914, in which you state that your honour has already mentioned in your previous letter that the exalted Government of Great Britain has declared war against the Ottoman Government, and that you have been ordered by the illustrious Govern ment to invite us to co-operate with the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Ruler of Koweit—our cordial friends and sincere allies—and attack Basrah The co-operation with the above-mentioned two friends is incumbent upon us (and so is it for us to) use our good offices with our friends, the illustrious Government, in all useful actions which may be required by her. And I am using my endeavours and efforts in furthering the common interests of all friends. You should rest fully- assured and be confident in this question.4 &lt;£ I am oiig of tliG greatest helpers to the Government of Great Bntait incJ she will God willing, obtain satisfactory results, as we have mentioned to our mutual friend, Captain Shakespear. As to the Ottoman soldiers, we did not allow a single one of them to remain (in these parts) after our occupation, and have turned them all out. . . . . ^ “ But as to the following three matters mentioned by you, namely, the promise* of the exalted Government to protect and safeguard us against the Ottoman Government by affording us her assistance and her future protection (to us) against any attack and hostility which may he made by sea, her recognition of the independence of t my chiefship on all the parts of Nejd, al-Hasa, and Qatif, and the conclusion of treaties between us, (these) will depend on our arrival at Koweit. I am leaving my headquarters on this date and am bound tor Koweit, and we will make the necessary verbal negotiations, in order that we may earn the approval of our friend, the Government of Great Britain.” Ko further steps were taken on the British side till Captain Shakespear, travelling vi4 Bahrein and Koweit, reached Bin Sand’s camp on the 31st December, 1914 (30472/1385/15 : No. 2). _ . . i . a ^ During the next few days he discussed exhaustively with Bin Saud the latter s relations with Great Britain and Turkey since their previous meeting a year before. Bin Saud referred to the various messages he had received from representatives of Great Britain during the past three months, and dwelt especially upon the letter of the 3 rd November, 1914, from the Officiating Besident in the Gulf. He cited the three assurances contained in it, but remarked that— “ the document was a vague letter, did not specify whether the assurances were limited merely to the present war or also included the future, gave no hint whether other conditions would be required of himself later, and could not be regarded as a binding instrument between the two parties for the future.’ Captain Shakespear concluded from these conversations that Bin Saud— “ had no intention of abandoning his neutral position, with freedom to make his own arrangements with the Turks (and he was confident that he could secure from them a very good £ second best ’) until he held a signed and sealed treaty with the British Government ; nor would he move a step further towards making matters either easier for us or more difficult for the Turks so far as the present war was concerned, until he obtained in that treaty some very solid guarantee of his position, with Great Britain practically as his suzerain.” Captain Shakespear therefore asked Bin Saud to draw up “ a preliminary draft, containing what he was prepared to accept and what he desired,” which he (Captain Shakespear) might then forward to His Majesty’s Government for their consideration. This suggestion was promptly carried out by Bin Saud, and in a report, dated the 4 th January, 1915, to Sir P. Cox (in which the foregoing conversations were also put on record) Captain Shakespear submitted a rough translation of Bin Saud’s desiderata :— “ The clauses which will be reasons for a binding agreement between myself ( £ Bin Saud ’) and the Great British Government:— 1 2 1 . That the British Government will acknowledge and admit that Nejd, al-Hasa, Qatif, their surroundings and the ports appertaining to them on the shores of the Persian Gulf are to me and (are) the territory of my fathers and forefathers ; that I am the independent ruler of them, and after me my sons and their descendants by inheritance; and that the above-mentioned territory is an independent territory in which there is no (right of) interference to any foreign Power. 2 . That they (the British Government) will declare its (the territory’s) boundaries north, south, east, and west, by land and by sea, and that (regarding) the nomads who wander between neighbouring towns, which are either under British protection or (directly) under British Government, if there should arise differences between me and the chiefs of the said towns and complaints be made in (these) matters, they should be decided according to the ownership of fathers and ancestors. 0 T of Bing@ 3. That all existing jurisdiction in all my territories shall continue in accordance with the laws of the sacred Mohammedan Shariat, according to^ the sect of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal-as-Salafi, and all who dwell therein shall be subject to them in all matters or (shall be subject) to the customary law of the towns in which they may be, whether my own subjects or the subjects of States adjacent to my territories—by reason of religious obligation we are helpless without it nor can we exceed it. 4. There shall be no permission to any foreigner to acquire a hand’s-breadth of my territories (within the defined) boundaries, not even by a substitute, except after reference to myself and with my permission. 5. After acknowledgment of the above clauses, that she (Great Britain) will promise to prevent and to defend from all oppression and aggression which may come upon or happen to my territories by land or by sea, from whatever Power it may be. “ 6 . That she (Great Britain) will promise that she will not permit nor encourage nor accord sanctuary to accused persons or fugitives from our territories, whether townsmen or nomads. “ 7. That she (Great Britain) will respect and protect the rights of my subjects, and deal with them as she deals with her own subjects while they may be (resident) in her territories and dependencies. “ 8 . If she (Great Britain) accepts and acknowledges the foregoing clauses, then I accept and acknowledge severance of dealings with any other Power in all (matters of) concessions, interference, and intercourse, except with reference to the Great British Government. 9. I bind myself to protect trade within my territories from all aggression, and that I will deal (with her subjects) according to the treatment my own subjects receive in all matters of government and business in her (Great Britain’s) countries and dependencies. “ 10 .' I bind myself to the protection (in) the coasts and ports which are under my Government from all aggression to the subjects of the British Government and those under their protection. “ 11 . I will forbid the traffic in arms and ammunition, whether by a Govern ment or by (way of) merchandise, from all the ports which are under my Government, on condition that if I should be in need of anything in arms and ammunition I will refer to the British Government in order to obtain my wants.” In forwarding this document, Captain Shakespear added some observations of his own, which have still, after four years, an important bearing on the eventual settlement of our permanent relations with Bin. Saud after the war :— # “ I venture to submit that Bin Saud, in effect, asks for little more than what has been already conveyed in the Acting Besident’s assurances, if these were meant to apply to the future and were not limited to the present crisis, and if they are interpreted liberally and generously. In exchange, Bin Saud offers to make himself a British vassal for good. The addition to our responsibilities does not appear heavy :— “(a.) The Turkish menaces from the west and north of Nejd, though very real to Bin Saud, need give us no anxiety—we have no reason to suppose they will be more successful in the future than they have been within the last two or three decades, while, guaranteed from attack by sea, Bin Saud will be in a far better position to meet them than was possible hitherto. Should they become threatening, strong diplomatic representations would probably suffice to prevent any attempt on a scale with which Bin Saud could not cope himself. “ (6.) We should probably be called upon to act as arbiters somewhat more frequently than hitherto between the Arab Sheikhs along the coast and Bin Saud, a duty largely to the advantage of our own interests. * Three weeks later, on the 24th January, 1915, Captain Shakespear was killed in a battle between Bin Saud and Bin Rashid, at which he had insisted on being present. No blame attaches to Bin Saud for this lamentable event. [939] C6 “ On the other hand, the advantages seem to be considerable :— “(a.) Complete control of the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. “ (b.) Similar complete control of the arms traffic. “(c.) The practical exclusion of foreign Powers and influence in Central Arabia. &lt;&amp;+ “ (d.) The security induced by British suzerainty and ‘Bin Sand’s’ strong control of the Bedouin tribes will give a great impetus to trade through the Persian Gulf ports, probably diverting a share of what now passes through the Bed Sea ports. “ (c.) The great influence Bin Sand has over Mohammedan opinion in Arabia, an influence likely to increase as the Turkish Empire breaks up and the Khalifate of the Sultan is questioned, will be a British asset. “ (/.) Bin Saud’s influence with ail Arab tribes, and particularly with the Northern Anazah, with whom our occupation of Lower Mesopotamia will bring us in close contact. Upon receipt of Captain Shakespear’s report, Sir P. Cox telegraphed on the 16th January, 1915, to the Government of India (17000/1385/15 : No. 49) a summary of Bin Saud’s desiderata, and made the following further suggestions:— “ Bin Saud should undertake :— “First. —To receive representative of British Government either at his capital or sea-port or both, if desired. “Secondly. —To agree (to) extra-territoriality for our non-Mohammedan subjects. “ Thirdly. —To abstain from waging war by sea without our consent, and to co-operate for the suppression of piracy. “ Fourthly. —To protect pilgrim traffic passing through his territory. “ Fifthly. —To levy customs dues at rates which we consider reasonable, having regard to rate prevailing at Bahrein and Koweit. &lt;£ Sixthly. —To allow British merchant vessels to visit his ports. “Seventhly. —To agree to locate post office and possibly telegraph office at his port when the time comes.” “ I do not include any item regarding slave trade, as that is not now a serious difficulty, and has given us no trouble at Koweit. “ Only point regarding which it seems necessary to offer comment here is the question of protection against external aggression by land. When we invited Bin Saud to move on Basrah, we undertook to protect him against reprisals by Turks, so that, as far as latter are concerned, what Bin Saud now asks us to give does not amount to much more. Apart from Turks, Central Arabia is practically inaccessible by land to any Power but ours, and I venture to think that we should incur little risk by giving the desired undertaking, subject to (the) reservation that aggression be unprovoked. “ We have publicly declared that our object is to effect liberation of Arabs from oppressive yoke (of) Turkey. In this case there is no question of annexation of territory to which our allies could take exception, while Bin Saud’s weight in scale would be no mean asset to joint cause of us all. Can I possibly be authorised to draft a treaty on above lines for negotiation by Captain Shakespear ? I shall not now have the opportunity of meeting Bin Saud myself. “ I am obliged to give Bin Saud some reply by his messenger, who has orders to return at once. I am sending Captain Shakespear purport of above additional points and asking him to use his discretion in discussing them with Bin Saud. To Bin Saud I am replying that I hope that an instrument safeguarding his position can be arrived at somewhat on lines indicated, and that I have telegraphed to Government on subject, but that treaty must necessarily take a little time to draw up.”* On the 29th January, 1915, after further correspondence with Sir P. Cox (21633/15, Nos. 3 and 8 ), the Viceroy telegraphed to the India Office as follows &lt;11837/1385/15) “ In order to expedite settlement, Bin Saud has himself submitted memo randum setting forth tentatively his proposals for formulation of treaty. These z:include many matters of detail, fraught with difficulty and requiring ripe con- S] derat ion—for instance, definition of boundaries, law and jurisdiction, harbouring o refugees, reciprocal treatment of subjects, arms traffic, and arms facilities. consider ea py conclusion of treaty with Bin Saud most important, but that for the present, it should be on broad lines somewhat similar to the original Afghanistan agreement with Abdur Rahman, and suggest following :— c 1. British Government recognises Bin Saud as independent ruler of iNejd, Hasa, and Katif, and guarantees hereditary succession to his dynasty’ subject to the acceptance of successors by tribesmen and approval of His Majesty’s Government; 2. In the event of unprovoked aggression on his territories by any foreign Power, British Government are prepared to aid Bin Saud'to such extent and in such manner as the situation may require ; o. In return, Bin Saud agrees to have no dealings with any other foreign Power, nov grant concessions to subjects of any other foreign Power, except on the advice of the British Government, which advice he will unreservedly follow ; 4. British Government and Bin Saud agree to conclude, as soon as this can be arranged, a detailed treaty in regard to other matters jointly concerning them. “ Cox agrees that a preliminary treaty on these lines would meet the case, and thinks Bin Saud would accept it. Dynastic guarantee of some kind would probably be essential.* That proposed appears sufficiently guarded.” On the 30th January, 1915, the India Office communicated this telegram to the Foreign Office with the following observations (11837/1385/15) : — “ The desirability of concluding a treaty with Amir Abdul Aziz follows not merely from the exigencies of the moment, which make it necessary to pay an immediate price for his friendship, but also from the general situation that will be created in the Persian Gulf in the event, as the result of the present war, of the disappearance of Turkish rule from Basra, to which His Majesty’s Government are pledged. It may be anticipated that the Amir of Nejd will be left the master not only of Central Arabia, but also of a long strip of the coast, and in the interest of peace and order it will be essential for the Power that controls the Gulf to have a working arrangement with him. The extent, therefore, to which his claims must be met must be measured not only by the immediate services which he is expected to render, but also by the potential power for mischief which, in the event of success, he will possess, and if permanently estranged will doubtless exercise. “ As regards the terms of the treaty suggested by the Government of India, the dynastic pledge is undoubtedly the crux, but safeguarded in the manner proposed it appears to be free from reasonable objection. It is, however, more than probable that the condition that the successor must be accepted by the tribesmen will be a stumbling-block to Bin Saud, as it was to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in whose case His Majesty’s Government, under the pressure of the war, have recently approved its abolition. Moreover, regard being had to the very large area over which Bin Saud is to rule and the notoriously factious temper of the Arabs, it may be very difficult to fulfil in practice. We must therefore be prepared for opposition from Bin Saud, and the Marquess of Crewe would not let the negotiations break down over this point. “ The guarantee against unprovoked aggression should, in his Lordship’s opinion, be so worded as to make His Majesty’s Government sole judges of the nature and extent of the assistance to be given. 44 Subject to these remarks Lord Crewe commends the proposals of the Government of India to Sir E. Grey’s favourable consideration. It is a question whether, in view of the importance of our eventual relations with Bin Saud, the present treaty should not contain a clause binding him (subject to an agreement as to boundaries in the detailed treaty to be concluded later) to abstain from inter ference with Koweit, Bahrein, al-Kiatar, and the Trucial Chiefs. His Lordship would propose to suggest this to the Government of India, but to leave it to their discretion. * The Turks had given Bin Saud a dynastic guarantee in their Treaty of the 15th May, 1914.r fl i. On the 1 st February, 1915, the India Office, with the concurrence of the FcHign Office, instructed the Viceroy, in the sense of the above letter, as follows (11837/15 ; 14168/15):— “ Your proposals are approved subject to following remarks :— In dynastic guarantee condition of acceptance of tribesmen should btV'*' secured if possible, but you will remember difficulty which this caused in case of Mohammerah, and negotiations should not be allowed to break down over this point. You are presumably prepared for Sheikh of Koweit to ask for similar guarantee when both Bin Saud and Sheikh of Mohammerah have it. Pledge against unprovoked aggression should be so worded as to make His Majesty’s Government sole judges of nature and extent of assistance. Please consider whether this treaty should not contain clause binding Bin Saud, subject to eventual definition of boundaries, not to interfere with Koweit, Bahrein, al Katar, and Trucial Chiefs. But I leave this to your discretion.” 3. On the 6th February, 1915, the Government of India communicated these instructions to Sir P. Cox (30472/15 : No. 6), and authorised him to enter into negotiations with Bin Saud on the lines laid down, “ on the clear understanding that anv Treaty agreed upon is subject to the confirmation of the Government of India.” Accordingly, Sir P. Cox drafted a treaty in seven articles, the terms of which (see 111069/15) may be summarised at this point:— Article 1 .—His Majesty’s Government recognise Bin Saud as independent ruler of Nejd, al Hasa, Qatif, and their ports on the Gulf Coast, and his descendants after him, “ but the selection of the individual shall be subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government.” Article 2 .—His Majesty’s Government shall aid Bin Saud at their discretion in case of unprovoked aggression against him by a foreign Power. Article 3.—Bin Saud renounces diplomatic relations with any foreign Power other than His Majesty’s Government. Article 4.—Bin Saud will not cede, sell, or mortgage territory, or grant concessions to any foreign Power or its subjects, without the consent of His Majesty’s Government Article 5.—Bin Saud will keep open the pilgrimage routfes through his territory to the Holy Places, and will protect pilgrims. Article 6 .—Bin Saud will refrain from interference with Koweit, Bahrain, Qatar, and the Oman Coast, and any other tribes and chiefs under His Majesty’s Government's protection. Article 7. —A further detailed treaty shall be concluded later. About the same time (43530/15: No. 14) Bin Saud wrote to Sir P. Cox, asking, in view of Captain Shakespear’s death, either that another officer should be deputed, or that negotiations should be continued by correspondence direct from Basra, and not via Koweit. On the 24th February, 1915, in reporting this request to the Government of India, Sir P. Cox made the following proposal : ■ — £ ' I would propose now to send him draft treaty which was awaiting despatch througlq Shakespear, together with Viceroy’s letter. In doing so I would advise him to sign it without delay, and say that, as soon as it is completed, an officer can then be deputed to discuss details of second treaty.” The Government of India instructed Sir P. Cox to act as he proposed, and on the 28th February, 1915, this was reported by the Viceroy to the India Office (24119/15). Sir P. Cox’s draft and the Viceroy’s letter were accordingly forwarded to Bin Saud, and two letters, both dated the 24th April, 1915, and addressed respectively to the Viceroy and Sir P. Cox, were eventually received in reply from Bin Saud (111069/15). In his letter to Sir P. Cox, Bin Saud enclosed a signed copy oi the Arabic version of the treaty. But, to quote his words— “ Certain modifications (which are not important) were found necessary for cogent reasons, necessitated by local conditions, the need to reassure the inhabi-flints and the governing family of Bin Saud, and also in view of the knowledge we possess as to the circumstances of the Arabs.” Sir Percy Cox replied to Bin Saud as follows in a letter dated the 26th June,, ^15:— “As regards the treaty, I have understood what you wrote, explaining that you had made certain modifications in the text. I have not the least doubt that we shall succeed in adjusting the wording of the articles into a form which will suit both parties and safeguard the interests of yourself and us ; but, as the wording was difierent to what the Government had approved previously, it has been necessary for me to refer it to them.” On the same date he forwarded to the Government of India translations of his own and Bin Saud’s drafts in parallel columns, adding a schedule of Bin Saud’s alterations, and commenting upon them. It may be convenient to set out the two versions in this memorandum :— British draft. In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate. The High British Government on its own part, and Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal al- Saud, Euler of Hajd, A1 Hasa and Qatif, on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors and tribesmen, being desirous of confirming and strengthening the friendly relations which have for generations existed between the two parties, and with a view to consolidating their respective interests—the British Government have named and appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., British Eesident in the Persian Gulf, as their Plenipotentiary to conclude a Treaty for this purpose with Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Bahman-bin-Faisal al-Saud, The said Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, arid Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Kahman-bin-Faisal al- Saud, hereafter known as “ Bin Saud,” have agreed upon and concluded the following articles :—- L The British Government do acknowledge and admit that Hajd, A1 Hasa and Qatif, and their territories and ports on the shores of the Persian Gulf are the territory of Bin Saud and of his fathers before him, and do hereby recognise the said Bin Saud as the independent Euler thereof, and after him his sons and descendants by in heritance, but the selection of the individual shall be subject to the approval of the British Government, after confidential consultation with them.

Cox’s letter and enclosures were received by the Government of India on the 5th July, 1915, and on the 7th July, 1915, the Viceroy telegraphed as follows to the India Office “ We have carefully examined modifications proposed by Bin Saud in the preliminary treaty sent to him by Cox for acceptance. These modifications are for the most part unimportant. Important modifications are — “In article 1, he omits Words ‘subject to approval of British Government after consultation with them ’ in regard to selection of successor. Cox thinks that Bin Saud will accept our wording or some other suitable phrase when our motive is explained. If, however, he refuses, we think we might give way on this point. “Article 2, as* modified by Bin Saud, reads: ‘In the event of aggression by any foreign Power on territories of countries belonging to the said Bin Saud and his descendants, British Government will aid Bin Saud in all circumstances and in any place, thus omitting the word ‘ unprovoked,’ and entirely altering the words ‘ to such extent and in such manner as situation may seem to them to require.’ We think word ‘ unprovoked or some similar term should be inserted, and would suggest words ‘ to such extent and in such manner as may be expedient,’ in place of Bin Sand’s suggestion.H “ In article 4, he adds that he will follow the advice of His Majesty’s Govern- men w ere is interests require it.’ Cox suggests ‘ where his interests are not injured ^thereby, and this seems unobjectionable. w Jv G ? X vP ro P os ^ aiTan ge a meeting shortly with Bin Sand to adjust differences, i . f. 1 x in 1 should be authorised to do so, and to negotiate a treaty on lines above indicated, subject to ratification by Government of India.” . UPP August, 1915, the India Office communicated to the Foreign Office copies of this telegram and of the documents received from Sir P. Cox, and submitted a draft telegram of instructions to the Viceroy. a ?° V ^ ^tter explaining the grounds of the instructions proposed in this ra t, the India Office laid particular stress upon Bin Saud’s omission of the words subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government,” at the end of article 1 :— It is ordinarily the policy of His Majesty’s Government to recognise only the de /acto ruler, and to avoid giving dynastic guarantees; and the rare exceptions which they have made have been in cases—such as that of Mohammerah—where 'PCI ie ^ a li°ns with the ruler have been of long standing, and where the responsi- un dertaken are limited. Neither of these conditions is present in the case of Bin Baud, and Mr. Chamberlain therefore hopes that Sir P. Cox may be able to obtain the restoration of the words. Those which Bin Baud proposes to substitute are apparently intended to provide for the constitutional election of a successor in a case where the ruler has failed to designate during his lifetime. There seems to be no objection to such a provision, so long as the method of election is practicable, but it does not appear how in such a case His Majesty’s Government are to ensure that only a person agreeable to themselves shall be elected. Since, however, a person elected by a tribal majority would probably have no difficulty in maintaining nimself as de facto ruler, if the election had been conducted by a method recognised by the tribes themselves to be valid, undesirable complications are perhaps unlikely to arise.” The draft was concurred in by the Foreign Office, and the following telegram was accordingly despatched by the India Office to the Viceroy on the 16th August, 1915 (111069/15 and 116544/15):— “ Article 1 of treaty. Cox, after suitable explanation, should press for resto ration of original words, to which His Majesty’s Government attach great importance. There seems no objection to election* in default of designation, pro vided method of election is practicable and recognised as valid according to Arab custom by all tribes concerned. Otherwise we may become involved in inter-tribal disputes. “ Article 2. £ Unprovoked ’ should be restored. His Majesty’s Government do not like leaving ambiguity as to their aid, and if Bin Baud will not agree to original words they would prefer £ to such extent and in such manner as British Government after consultation with Bin Baud may consider most effective for protecting his interests.’ ££ Article 4. Cox should secure omission of Bin Saud’s addition if possible ; if not, substitution of his own proposal. ££ As regards other alterations he should exercise his discretion.” On the 18th August, 1915, the Government of India communicated the telegraphic correspondence that had passed between the Viceroy and the India Office to Sir P. Cox, and authorised him (141285/15) to arrange a meeting with Bin Baud, as he might think advisable, and negotiate further on these lines, on the understanding that a treaty, if concluded, would be subject to ratification by the Government of India. Accordingly, Sir P. Cox resumed negotiations, and concluded a definite treaty with Bin Baud, on the 26th December, 1915 (201630/15). In a letter dated the 3rd January, 1916 (38086/4650/16), he forwarded to the Government of India a translation of the treaty as signed, and also set out the text of this and of the original British draft (both in translation) in parallel columns, with the alterations marked, and with comments on each alteration, explaining how it arose and * For the words in the British draft of article 1 which the Viceroy quoted in his telegram of the 7th July, 1915, Bin Sand had substituted “ by the living ruler or by calling for the votes of the subjects inhabiting those countries.”12 what its effect would, be. A. copy of tbe text signed on tins occasion, and subbecpie.. dy ratified is printed at the end of the present memorandum, and the passages that differ from the original draft (printed on pp. 9-10 above) are there done into italics. Copies of this text, and of Sir P. Cox’s comments, were transmitted by letter to the India Office on the 21 st January, 1916, and on the 8 th February, 1916, the Viceroy^ telegraphed to the India Office (26095/16) that the Government of India proposed to' r ratify the treaty in this form if the India Office saw no objection. This proposal was approved by the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, in a telegram to the Viceroy, dated the 6 th March,. 1916 (40708/15 and 67554/15). On the 10 th March, 1916, the Government of India wrote accordingly to Sir P. Cox (71652/16), returning him the two original copies of the treaty signed by himself and Bin Saud, and attaching parchment copies of the English translation, with instructions that the Arabic version should be written in on the margin of these, and that they should then likewise be signed by Sir P. Cox and Bin Saud. These instructions appear to have been carried out, and the parchment copies returned in due course to India. The treaty was eventually ratified by the Government of India on the 18th July, 1916 (174647/16). Shortly after this, Sherif Husein, with whom His Majesty’s Government had entered into relations in the latter part of 1915, wrote to Bin Saud asking for £C alliance ” and “ assistance ; ” and Bin Saud reported this to Sir P. Cox, recalling former aggressions by the Sherif on his (Bin Sand’s) territories arid tribes, and expressing mistrust of the Sherd’s intentions. (See Memorandum on British Commitments to King Husein, Section (vii)). In view of this, Sir P. Cox submitted on the 8 th September, 1916, that Bin Saud “ should be informed definitely that no present or future understandings between us and the Sherif would prejudice our adherence to the terms of Articles 1 and 2 of our treaty with him of the 26th December, 1915.” And he also suggested that the terms of this treaty might be communicated to the Sherif (180581/16). / In regard to the first of these proposals, the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office (183325/16), telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 19th September, 1916 (191509/16), informing him that “as the policy of encouraging an Arab State or Confederation of States was not dead, anything repudiating it should be avoided,” and instructing him that “ reference to the treaty should be confined to Article 1 , as we could not admit that Article 2 was binding on us as against other Arabs.” These instructions appear to have been carried out by Sir P. Cox in the form of a verbal assurance to Bin Saud on the occasion of a durbar held at Koweit on the 21 st November, 1916, at which Bin Saud was decorated by him with the K.C.I.E. in the presence of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah (235981/16 and 236884/16). The terms of the treaty of the 26th December, 1915, were also communicated to King Husein in due course (see Memorandum on British Commitments to King Husein, Section (vii) ), in accordance with Sir P. Cox’s suggestion. Relation of Commitments to Bin Saud to British Desiderata. In considering the bearing of this treaty with Bin Saud upon British desiderata, it has to be remembered that it was intentionally confined to immediate essentials ; that important questions like the regulation of the arms traffic and the status of British nationals in Bin Saud’s territory (brought up by Bin Saud himself), or, again, the binding over of Bin Saud to keep the peace at sea in the Gulf (brought up by Sir P. Cox) were postponed for later consideration by the consensus of the Government of India and the India Office; that article 7 provides for the conclusion of a detailed treaty hereafter ; and that Bin Saud rather than His Majesty’s Government has pressed that this should be carried out at an early date. In examining the present treaty, therefore, little account need be taken of omissions. Yet it may be pointed out that, even as the treaty stands, it contains all the elements of a true trucial treaty. These elements are {a) the right and obligation of His Majesty’s Government to arbitrate in case of disputes between the other party to the treaty and his neighbours, who are bound by similar treaties to His Majesty’s Government; (5) tbe renunciation by the other party of any relations with foreign Powers except through His Majesty’s Government; and (c) a promise on the part of the other party not to alienate territory to a foreign Power except with His Majesty’s Government’s consent. Of these essential elements, (b) and (c) are explicitly embodied in articles 3 and 4 respectively ; while (a), though nowhere set out in terms, would appear to be covered satisfactorily by article 2 and the last clause in article 4.ms treaty, therefore, although it was never intended to be exhaustive, is on soun er mes than our treaty with the Idrisi or our more informal arrangements with mg Kusem, and there ought to be considerably less difficulty in expanding it, when tie tune comes, into a definitive treaty settling our relations with Bin Sand in detail. P ere are, however, several positive points affecting British desiderata to which the present treaty appears to commit us :— (1 .)—Demarcation of Territories. In article 1 we^ recognise Bin Saud as independent ruler of certain enumerated countries 4 and their dependencies and territories, which will be discussed and deter mined hereafter.” This is less explicit than our undertaking to the Idrisi (article 6 of Idrisi Treaty, for which see Memorandum on British Commitments to the Idrisi), in which we under take^ at the conclusion of the war to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi Saiyid and the Imam Yahya, or any other rival.” But in effect it commits us to arbitrate on the territorial questions at issue between Bin Saud and King Husein, and in the last resort to impose an effective sanction for our award. ( 2 .)—Keeping of the Peace. In the original trucial treaties with the Independent Chiefs of 44 Trucial Oman,” His Majesty’s Government’s rights and obligations were strictly limited to the main tenance of peace at sea, and we did not attempt to control the mutual relations on land of the Arab parties to this series of treaties. This formula set a very desirable limit to His Majesty’s Government’s liabilities, while covering most of the causes of strife between the local Arab rulers. The trucial chiefs of Oman hold svray in a narrow strip of territory between the sea and an uninhabited desert. The activities of their subjects are almost wholly maritime, and there are no nomadic tribes in their area of jurisdiction to create difficulties of allegiance and demarcation. But it is evident that if the British trucial system, hitherto confined to the fringe between the south and east coasts and the great south-eastern desert, is to be extended, as it has been extended during the war, to the remainder of the Peninsula, we shall have to keep the peace between rulers whose prosperity depends, not upon the coasting trade or the pearl fisheries, but upon the command of inland oases and Bedouin tribes. Bin Saud, the Idrisi, and King Husein, with whom we have entered into relations during the war, are rulers of this latter kind. A 44 Pax Britannica” in the Persian Gulf and the Bed Sea, valuable and indeed iridispensable as it is, will do comparatively little to remove the causes of friction between them, or to enable His Majesty’s Government to deal effectively with such friction when it arises. If we are to keep the peace between them, w 7 e shall be driven eventually to control their relations with one another by land. To a certain extent this may be done by a maritime blockade. But apart from the fact that, where political authority is as lax as it is in Arabia, it is difficult to blockade one State effectively without blockading the whole Peninsula,* it is in the nature of things more difficult to bring pressure to bear on Hail or Er-Biadh by this method than on Sharjah, or even Maskat. Besides this, our new Arab Allies are considerably more powerful than most of the Arab rulers who have previously entered into a trucial relationship with us. And in the case of King Husein, who is likely to be the most troublesome of all over his relations with his neighbours, it is peculiarly difficult for His Majesty’s Government to exert pressure, whether by blockade or otherwise, owing to the sanctity of his territory in the eyes of the Moslem world, and the traffic of pilgrims between his ports and every other Moslem country. . . The keeping of the peace on land thus appears to be the crucial problem in that extension of the British trucial system over the remainder of the Arabian Peninsula, which has been carried a long way towards completion during the war. The Treaty with Bin Saud is our first experiment in this more highly-developed and difficult form of trucial relationship, and in their ruling on the Treaty a short time after its ratification (see above), the India Office laid down the important^ doctrine that 44 we cannot admit that Article 2 is binding on us as against other Arabs.” On this ruling, our obligations to Bin Saud by land would be confined to securing him against aggression on the part of some outside Power {e.g., Turkey, Persia, * This seems a fair induction from our experiences during the war at Koweit. [939] El 14 Germany, Russia, France). But it may perhaps be doubted whether our adnf ited obligations, under Article 1, regarding'the demarcation of his territories would not commit us to active intervention against any other Arab ruler, such as King Husein, who might resort to force to reverse our award. It would appear desirable that, on this question, which affects all our new AraJ^, relationships, a clear line of policy should be determined upon. (3.) Dynastic Guarantee, In concluding a trucial treaty with an Arab ruler, it has not been His Majesty’s Government’s custom to recognise it as binding them to his descendants. But it is evident that it would have been difficult to avoid doing so ultimately in cases in which our relationship had lasted over a long period, or in which the dynasty was firmly established and possessed prestige. The dynastic guarantee accorded to Bin Saud in Article 2 of the present Treaty merely follows a precedent already set in the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah (see Memorandum on British Commitments to the Gulf Chiefs), and it is hedged round with reservations. This would not appear to be so crucial a question as that of keeping the peace on land, but the history of our relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Katar shows that a dynastic guarantee might prove awkward in certain cases, and that the precedent should not too readily be made into a general rule.APPENDIX. m TEXT OF THE TREATY OF DECEMBER 26, 1915. In the Name of God the Merciful and Compassionate. Preamble. British Government on its own part, and Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal Ai-oaud, Ruler of Najd, El Hassa, Qatif and Jubail, and the towns and ports belongmg to them, on u ^ heirs and successors, and tribesmen, being desirous of confirming and strengthening the friendly relations which have for a long time existed between the two parties, and with a view to consolidating their respective interests—the British Government have named and appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., British Resident in the Persian Gulf, as their Plenipotentiary, to conclude a treaty for this purpose with Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal Al-Saud. The said Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox and Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal Al-Saud (hereafter known as “ Bin Saud ), have agreed upon and concluded the following articles :— I. The British Government do acknowledge and admit that Najd, El Hassa, Qatif and Jubail, and their dependencies and territories, which will be discussed and determined hereafter, and their ports on the shores of the Persian Gulf are the countries of Bin Saud and of his fathers before him, and do hereby recognise the said Bin Saud as the independent Ruler thereof and absolute Chief of their tribes, and after him his sons and descendants by inheritance ; but the selection of the individual shall be in accordance with the nomination (he., by the living Ruler) of his successor; but with the proviso that he shall not be a person antagonistic to the British Covernment in any respect ; such as, for example, in regard to the terms mentioned in this treaty. II. In the event of [“ unprovoked ” omitted] aggression by any foreign Power on the territories of the countries of the said Bin Saud and his descendants without reference to the British Government and without giving her an opportunity of communicating with Bin Saud and composing the matter, the British Government will aid Bin Saud to such extent and in such a manner as the British Govern ment after consulting Bin Saud may consider most effective for protecting his interests and countries. III. Bin Saud hereby agrees and promises to refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, or treaty with any foreign nation or Power, and, further, to give immediate notice to the political authorities of the British Government of any attempt on the part of any other Power to interfere with the above territories. IY. Bin Saud hereby undertakes that he will absolutely not cede, sell, mortgage, lease, or otherwise dispose of the above territories or any part of them, or grant concessions within those territories to any foreign Power or to the subjects of any foreign Power,* without the consent of the British Government. And that he will follow her advice unreservedly provided that it be not damaging to his own interests. V. Bin Saud hereby undertakes to keep open within his territories the roads leading to the Holy Places, and to protect pilgrims on their patsage to and from the Holy Places. * The words “ or the subjects of any foreign Power ” were accidentally omitted in the copies signed by Sir P. Cox and Bin Saud on the 26th December, 1915. Sir P. Cox drew Bin Saud’s attention to this omission in a letter dated the 27th December, 1915 (38086/16), and added : “ I have duly written them in the text of the original document which I am submitting to Government, and Government will consider it in this form; so that if the same mistake occurs in the copy with you, I trust you will add the words above quoted.”16 VI. fa Bin Sand undertakes, as his fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression on or interfer ence with the territories of Kuwait, Bahrein, and of the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast [“other tribes and chiefs” omitted'], who are under the protection of the British Grovernment, and why*, have treaty relations with the said Government; and the limits of their territories shall be hereafte.w- determined. VII. The British Government and Bin Saud agree to conclude [words in original draft omitted] a further detailed treaty in regard to [word omitted] matters concerning the two parties. Dated 18th Safar 1334, corresponding to 26th December, 1915. (Signed and sealed) (Signed) ABDUL AZIZ AL-SAUD. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf. CHELMSFOBD, Viceroy a,nd Governor-General of India. This treaty was ratified by the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council at Simla, on the 18th day of July, 1916 a.d. (Signed) A. H. GRANT, Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department.BRITISH COMMITMENTS TO KING HUSE1N. • ^ UR CommRmeilt . s *° King Husein are not embodied in any agreement or treaty signed, or even acknowledged bv both r&gt;»vt;^ Tr, J , weaby Russia, France, Italy, and cerfain ind^emlen Y 'V ^ 0ir \ J tho . se ^ brn Sond cei independent Arab rulers such as the Idrisi and 11 tt' • ‘ , T } , , onl i &gt; 1 be 1 an alysed by summarising the history of our dealimrs with he King during the war, under different he ids. And the position is complicated by e mg s abit of ignoring or refusing to take note of conditions laid down by us to whic le objects and then carrying on as if the particular question had been settled between us according to his own desires. The references in the following summary, where not to Foreign Office papers, are AiAt :ilKt [- ir,c:;i ] , ' aiTa ;t ve compiled by the Arab Bureau at Cairo and dated the 29th November 1916. The pagination referred to is that of the Foreign Office copy ( S 6d ,'h F 6 Llbrar ^ under “Confidential: Turkey: Arab Bureau: 1914 (JNo. 112) ). ^ (i.) General Guarantees against the Restoration of the status quo. His Majesty’s Government’s representatives in Egypt had been in touch with Shenf Husein and his sons—especially Abdullah—before the war. On the 24th September 1914 (m the interval during which Great Britain was at war with Germany but not yet with Turkey) the Foreign Office telegraphed at Lord Kitchener’s request to Cairo, instructing that a special messenger should be sent to Abdullah to enquire what would be the Sherif’s attitude in the event of war with Turkey breaking out (p. 21 a). Abdullah sent a written answer expressing his preference for Great Britain over Turkey,— “ So long as she protects the rights of our country and the rights of the person of His Highness our present Emir and Lord and the rights of his Emirate and its independence in all respects, without any exceptions or restrictions, and so long as it supports us against any foreign aggression and in particular against the Ottomans, especially if they wish to set up any one else as Emir with the intention of causing internal dissension—their principle of government—and provided that the Govern ment of Great Britain would guarantee these fundamental principles clearly and in writing. This guarantee we expect to receive at the first opportunity ” (p. 23). This request was met in a Foreign Office telegram of the 31st October 1914 (the date on which war between Great Britain and Turkey was declared) :— “ Lord Kitchener’s salaams to Sherif Abdullah If the Arab nation assist England in this war that has been forced upon us by Turkey, England will guarantee that no inte rnal intervention takes place in Arabia, and will give Arabs every assistance against external aggression. “ It may be that an'Arab of true race will assume the Khalifate at Mecca or Medina and so good may come by the help of God out of all the evil that is now occurring ” (p. 24). This statement was transmitted to Abdullah by letter from Cairo with the following addition :— “ If the Emir of Mecca is willing to assist Great Britain in this conflict, Great Britain is willing, recognising and respecting the sacred and unique office of the Emir Husein (titles), to guarantee the independence, rights and privileges of the Sherifiate against all external foreign aggression, in particular that of the Ottomans. Till now we have defended Islam in the person of the Turks; henceforward it shall be in that of the noble Arabs ” (p. 24). [883] B9 In the letter which Sherif Husein sent to Sir H. McMahon in July, 1915, definitely proposing an agreement with His Majesty’s Goverment, he laid down the following condition :— “ Thirdly, for the security of this Arab independence and the certainty of such preference of economic enterprises, both high contracting parties to offer mutual assistance to the best ability of their military and naval forces, to face any foreign Power which may attack either party. Peace not to be decided without agreement of both parties ” (p. 40). This condition was more emphatically stated in the Sherifs third letter to Sir H. McMahon, dated the 5th November 1915 :— “ (5) When the Arab knows that the Government of Great Britain is their Ally who will not leave them to themselves at the conclusion of peace, in the face of Germany and Turkey, and that she will support and effectively defend them, then to enter the war at once will be, no doubt, in conformity with the general interest of the Arabs ” (p. 94). In reply to this, Sir H. McMahon, acting on Foreign Office instructions, gave the following assurance in his third letter to the Sherif, dated the 13th December, 1915 :— £k It is most essential that you should spare no effort to attach all the Arab peoples to our united cause, and urge them to afford no assistance to our enemies. “It is on the success of these efforts, and on the more active measures which the Arabs may hereafter take in support of our cause, when the time for action comes, that the permanence and strength of our agreement must depend. “ Under these circumstances, I am further directed by the Government of Great Britain to inform you that you may rest assured that Great Britain has no intention of concluding any peace, in terms of which the freedom of the Arab peoples from German and Turkish domination does not form an essential condition ” (p. 103). I he Sherif took note of this assurance in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon, dated the 1 st January, 1916 :— “ I have a strong belief, which the living will inherit from the dead, in the declarations which you gave in the conclusion of your honoured letter ” (p. 113). I he assurance was of course contingent, but the Sherif’s action since that date has evidently brought it into operation. It was repeated in a Foreign Office message telegraphed to Sir B. Wingate, on the 4th February, 1918, for transmission to the Sherif (now King of the Hejazj “His Majesty’s Government, along with their Allies, stand for the cause of the liDeration of the oppressed nations, and are determined to stand by the Arab peoples in their struggle for the reconstruction of an Arab world, in which law shall once again replace Ottoman violence and unity the artificial rivalries piomoted by^ Turkish officials. His Majesty’s Government re-affirm their former pledges to His Highness in regard to the freeing of the Arab peoples. Liberation is the policy His Majesty s Government have pursued and intend to pursue with unswerving determination by protecting such Arabs as are already liberated from toe danger of ie-conquest, and assisting such Arabs as are still under the yoke of the oppressor to obtain their freedom.” 1 Relation of Gomniitments under (i) to British desiderata :— No conflict, if interpreted in the light of our reservations under (iii), (iv) and (v). (in) Guarantees regarding the Moslem Holy Places. Government of India issued the following proclamation on the 2nd November, “ In view of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey, which to the loepet of Great Britain has been brought about by the ill-advised, unprovoked, am deliberate action of the Ottoman Government, his Excellency the Viceroy is authorised by His Majesty s Government to make the following public announce- 1 22108/146/18.merit m regard to the Holy Places of Arabia, including the Holy Shrines of r . opotamia and the Port of Jeddah, m order that there may be no misunder- t i e &gt; pa n 01 HlS ^'jfsty’s most loyal Moslem subjects as to the attitude o ±lis Majesty s Government m this war, in which no question of a religious character is involved. ^ These Holy Places and Jeddah will be immune from attack or molestation by bntish naval and military forces, so long as there is no inter- mrence w it i pi giims from India to the Holy Places and Shrines in question. At the request ot His Majesty’s Government, the Governments of France and Russia nave given similar assurances ” (p. 2 ). ^ nu]C ^ looser pledge, extending to the whole of Arabia, was given in a Foreign Office telegram of the 14th November, 1914, to the High Commissioner, Cairo:— t! His Majesty’s Government have no intention of undertaking any military or naval operations in Arabia, or against ibs ports, unless such a course becomes necessary for the protection of Arabian interests against Turkish or other aggression, or m support of any attempt by the Arabs to free themselves from lurkish rule. 0n t ] ; e 14th Apnl, 1915, the Foreign Office (acting on the strength of a letter addressed by Seyyid Sir All Morgham, Grand Kadi of the Sudan, to Sir R. Wingate- then Sirdar and forwarded by him) telegraphed to the High Commissioner, Cairo ou should inform Sir R. Wingate that he is authorised by me to let it be known, should he think it desirable, that His Majesty’s Government will make it an essential condition in the terms of peace that the Arabian Peninsula and its ilonammedan Holy Places should remain in the hands of an independent Sovereign State ” (p. 30 ). communicated to Sir Ali Morghani, and by him, apparently, to Siieut Husem. Later, towards the end of June, the substance of it was embodied m proclamations distributed in Egypt, the Sudan, and Arabia. In October, when the negotiations with the Sherif were well advanced, Faroki (a member of one of the Arab Nationalist organisations in the Ottoman army, who had passed over to the British lines at Gallipoli and had been brought to Egypt in October) submitted suggestions to the High Commissioner for assurances to the Sherif, one of them being that England will guarantee the Holy Places against external aggression and recognise their inviolability” (p. 51). Sir H.tMcMahon communicated this in a private telegram to Sir E. Grey on the 18th October, 1915. Instructions were sent him in a foreign Office telegram of the 20 th October, 1915, and embodied by him in his^ second letter, dated the 24th October, 1915, to Sherif Husein. In this letter Faroki s suggested assurance regarding the Holy Places was conveyed verbatim. Finally, the following declaration was made in an official communique published on the 29th July, 1916, in Egypt, after the Sherifs revolt, with the authorisation of the Foreign Office :— • It remains the fixed policy of Great Britain to abstain from all interference in religious matters and to spare no eftort to secure Holy Places of Islam from all external aggression. “ It is an unalterable point of British policy that those Holy Places should remain under independent Moslem rule and authority. “ The present state of war places many difficulties and dangers in the way of those wishing to perform the pilgrimage, but the action taken by the Sherif of Mecca gives rise to hopes that arrangements may be made whereby the pilgrims may in the coming year visit the Holy Shrines in peace and security” (p. 57, Part II). Relation of Commitments under (ii) to British desiderata :— No conflict. (iii.) Boundaries of Arab Independence. In the Foreign Office telegram of the 14th April, 1915 (No. 173), to the High Commissioner, Cairo (quoted in section (ii) above), His Majesty’s Government committed themselves to a public declaration that “ they will make it an essential condition in the terms of peace that the Arabian Peninsula should remain in the hands! J of an independent Sovereign State.” They added, however, that “ it is not possible to define at this stage exactly how much territory should be included in this State. ’ That question was raised in July 1915' by Sherif Husein in his first letter to Sir H. McMahon, the first of the conditions on which he proposed co-operation wit^ Great Britain against the Turks being as follows : — c&lt; England to acknowledge the independence of the Arab countries, bounded on the north by Mersina and Adana up to 37° of latitude, on which degree falls Birijik, Urfa, Mardin, Midiat, Amadia Island , 2 up to the border of Persia; on the east, by the borders of Persia up to the Gulf of Basrah ; on tlm south, by the Indian Ocean, with the exception ot the position of Aden to remain as it is ; on the west, by the Bed Sea, the Mediterranean Sea up to Mersina. ” (p. 40). It appears from a statement made by Faroki (for whom see section (ii) above) that Lord Kitchener’s assurance of the 31st October, 1914, to Sherif Abdullah (see section (i)) had been discussed between Sherif Husein and the Central Arab Nationalist Committee, which was at that time in being at Damascus, and that this territorial demand was suggested to the Sherif by the Committee . 3 Emissaries were sent from Damascus to Jeddah with instructions to bargain about this demand in detail, but to insist on a general acceptance of it by Great Britain as a condition of continuing negotiations. ... ^ . TT . On the 30th August, 1915, Sir H. McMahon, in his first letter to Sherif Husein, gave a non-committal answer on this point, re-affirming Lord Kitcheners pledges, but alluding to the discussion of boundaries as kC premature (p. 43). On the 9 th September, 1915, however, the Sherif, in his second letter, pressed for definition:— “ Your Excellency will pardon me and permit me to say clearly that the coolness and hesitation displayed in the question of the limits and boundaries, by saying that the discussion of these at present is of no use and loss of time, and that they are still in the hands of the Government which is ruling them, etc., might be taken to infer an' estrangement or something of the sort. “ As the limits and boundaries demanded are not those of one person whom we should satisfy, and with whom we should discuss them after the war is over, but our peoples have seen that the life of their new proposal is bound at least by these limits and their word is united on this; “ Therefore they have found it necessary to discuss this point first with the Power m whom they now have their confidence and trust as a final appeal, viz., the illustrious British Empire” (p. 44). The substance of this letter w r as conveyed to the Foreign Office by Sir H. McMahon on the 18th October, 1915 (telegram No. 623), and in a private telegram of the same date to Sir E. Grey 1 (p 4 9) he reported the results of further conversations with Faroki. Faroki declared that Germany had promised the Arab party the fulfilment of all their demands, and that they were at the parting of the ways. He expressed the opinion that:— • “ The occupation by France of purely Arab districts of Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Damascus would be opposed by Arabs with force of arms, but with this exception .... they would accept some modification of the North-western boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca ’ (p. 51). This latter suggestion by Faroki is important; for though it does not appear certain that it would have been agreed to by the rest of the Damascus party, and it has certainly never been agreed to by Sherif Husein, it was taken by His Majesty’s Government as the basis of their negotiations with France, and is the origin of the division between the Blue Area and Area A. It was embodied on the 24th October, 1915, in Sir H. McMahon’s second letter to the Sherif: — “ The districts of Mersina and Alexandretta, and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus. Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the proposed limits and boundaries. With the above modifications, and without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab Chiefs, we accept these limits and boundaries ; and in regard to those portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her Ally, France, I am empowered in the ? “Inland” or else “ Jezireh, Amadia.” 3 157740/15 : statement by Faroki,pp. 4 and 10. ^ 153045/15.name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances, and make the following reply to your letter :—- Subject to the above modifications. Great Britain is prepared to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories included in the ^ limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca ’ ” (p. 53 ). It will be noted that the reservation in favour of French interests, even within the narrower boundaries of Arab independence here proposed, prepared the ground for the establishment of Area A. On the 5th November, in his third letter, the Sherif agreed to the exclusion of Mersina and Adana, but formally reiterated his claim to the rest: — 5 “ In order to facilitate an agreement and to render a service to Islam, and at the same time to avoid all that may cause Islam troubles and hardships—seeing moreover that we have great consideration for the distinguished qualities and dispositions ot the Government of Great Britain—we renounce our insistence on the inclusion ot the vilayets of Mersina and Adana in the Arab Kingdom. But the provinces ot Aleppo and Beirout, and their sea-coasts, are purely Arab provinces, and there is no difference between a Moslem and a Christian Arab : they are both descendents of one forefather ” (p. 92). It may be remarked that he does not mention either the vilayet of Lebanon or the sanjak of Jerusalem—territories which were both excluded from the independent Arab State in the subsequent Anglo-French Agreement. But he has expressly claimed Lebanon on other occasions since then, and his reference to the Christian Arabs here implies its inclusion. The policy laid down with regard to the Christians was evidently inspired by the Damascus Committee, for Faroki, in his conversations at Cairo, stated their views on the point thus : — “ The basis of the new Arab Empire will be national, not religious. It will be an Arab, not a Moslem Empire. Christian Arabs, Druses, and Nosairia will have the same rights as Moslems, but the Jews will be governed by a special law. /! (l The Sherit’s renunciation of Mersina and Adana and guarantees to the Christian Arabs were taken note of by Sir H. McMahon in his third letter of the 13th December, 1915. His reiterated claim to Aleppo and Beirout vilayets was ignored (p. 102 ). On the 1 st January, 1916, in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon, the Sherif answered by declaring that he would not press his claims against France till after the war, but announcing his intention of then doing so :— “ As regards the northern parts and their coasts, we have already stated in our previous letter what were the utmost possible modifications ; and all this was done only so as to fulfil those aspirations whose attainment is desired by the will of the Blessed and Supreme God. It is this same feeling and desire which impelled us to avoid what may possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France and the agreement made between them during the present wars and calamities ; yet we find it our duty that the eminent Minister should be sure that, at the first opportunity after this war is finished, we shall ask you (what we avert our eyes from to-day) for what we now leave to France in Beirout and its coasts .... (p. 112 ). “ It is impossible to allow any derogation that gives France or any other Power a span of land in those regions” (p. 113). Sir H. McMahon answered this in his fourth letter of the 30th January 1916, by taking note of the Sherd's &lt;£ desire to avoid anything which might possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France,” and warning him that the friendship between the two countries would endure after the war (Part II, p. 5). The Sherif, on his part, never referred to the boundary question again during the negotiations, but there is evidence to show that the claims not accepted by His Majesty’s Government have not been withdrawn by him. 5 This formula (and not the Damascus-Homs-Hama-Aleppo line) was proposed to Sir Mark Sykes by Taroki about the beginning' of November (p. 104). Taroki and the Sherif were in communication through the Shenfs messenger to Cairo. 6 157740/15 : Faroki’s statement, p. 10. [883] CFor instance, a letter written to him by his son Sherit Ali on the 26th May, 1916, on the eve of the revolt, and mostly occupied with military details, concludes : “ Our Lord will not, we hope, forget Alexandretta, Beirout, and those regions” (Part II, p. 41). Again, Sherif Abdullah remarked to Colonel Wilson at Jeddah on the 1 st November, 1916, 7 d propos of his father’s assumption of the title of “ King of the Arabs,” that “the boundaries of his kingdom were settled previous to the revolt —a misstatement of the facts, unless it was intended, as it certainly was not, as an acceptance oi the boundaries His Majesty’s Government had consented to. On the 29th July, 1917, King Husein expressed his views on the boundary question to Captain Lawrence :— 8 “ The main points were that he had altogether refused to permit any Irench annexation of Beirout and the Lebanon. ‘ They are Arab countries, bul 1 will neither take them myself nor permit anyone else to take them. 1 hey have deserved independence and it is my duty to see they get it.’ “ He said that he refused a detailed discussion of boundaries on the grounds that hostilities between Turkey and the Allies still continue and all decisions taken now would necessarily have to be modified in accordance with the actual results of military operations, for which he must have an absolutely free hand.. £ If advisable we will pursue the Turks to Constantinople and Erzerum, so why talk about Beirout, Aleppo, and Hail.’ ” He revealed the same state of mind in conversations with Colonel Wilson a few months later . 9 From conversations with him during the second week of January, 191 8 , Commander Hogarth gathered that he still expected France and Great Britain to fall out, and calculated that he would be able to force the hand of the French with our backing . 10 On the 11 th February, 1918, Colonel Basset wrote to Sir 11. Wingate that “ King Husein had read into the terms of His Majesty’s Government’s ' pledge ’ very wide territorial boundaries, and professes the most implicit trust in the intention and ability of Great Britain to redeem the £ pledge ’ as he reads it.” 11 Relation of Commitments under (iii) to British Desiderata. The boundaries of Aiab independence to which His Majesty’s Government are committed by Sir H. McMahon’s second letter to Sherif Husein (24th October, 1915), exclude (a) the British territory and Protectorate of Aden ; and presumably also ( 6 ) the British Protectorate of Bahrein, since the Sherif’s claims take the ££ Indian Ocean ” as the boundary of the Arabian Peninsula, and make no mention of islands (see first letter of Jul y 1915, quoted above). On the other hand, they include (c) Akka-Haifa and (d) Basra, though, in the agreement of the 6 th Ma}-, 1916, with France, and in correspondence which has passed at various times between the Foreign Office and the India Office, it seems to be assumed that both these places will become British enclaves in the independent Arab area, attached in some formal way (whether by annexation, protectorate, or lease) to the Biitish Empire. Sir Mark Sykes reported that, in his conversations with Faroki early in November 1915, the latter stated that ££ the Arabs would agree to Basra town and all cultivated lands to the south being British territory.” 12 But there is no other record of such a concession on his part or on the part of any other representative of the Arab nationalist organisations in Turkey. And King Husein has never mentioned the possibility of this, nor have His Majesty’s Government mentioned it in their correspondence with him. 13 Again, the right of transporting British troops, in peace or war, along a British- owned railway from Akka-Haifa to Irak and the Persian Gulf has only been agreed to by France, Italy, and Russia, but has never been either demanded or consented to in any negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the Arabs themselves. In these cases, then, the relation between British commitments and desiderata remains unsettled.

McMahon’s letter of the 24th October, 1915, that is limited by reservations under (iv.)

J'l . i,is P rivafce telegram of the 18th October, 1915, to Sir E. Grey, Sir H. McMahon reported that “ with regard to Basra vilayet Faroki accepts the fact that special measures of British control will be necessary, in view of Great Britain’s interest there” (p. 51). J; 11 th e i r instructions telegraphed to Sir H. McMahon on the 20th October. 1915, the Foreign Office replied on this point: Mesopotamia. In view of the special interests in the Bagdad Province and aiea actually in our occupation, the proposed sphere of British control, namely, ihe Basrah vilayet, will need extension. This will not, of course, prejudice our interests with Arab Chiefs ” (p. 52). this was embodied on the 24th October, 1915, in Sir H. McMahon’s second letter to the Sherif:— “ With regard to the vilayets of Bagdad and Basrah, the Arabs will recognise that the established position and interests of Great Britain necessitate special measures of administrative control in order to secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local population and to safeguard our mutual economic interests ” (p. 54). i he Sherif took up the question on the 5th November, 1915, in his third letter to to Sir FI. McMahon :— “ As the provinces of Irak are parts of the pure Arab Kingdom, and were, in fact, the seat of its government in the time of Ali, and in the time of all the Khalils who succeeded him; and as in them began the civilisation of the Arabs, and as their towns in those provinces were the first towns built in Islam, where the Arab power became so great; therefore these provinces are greatly valued by all Arabs, far and near, and their traditions cannot be forgotten by them. Consequently we cannot satisfy the Arab Nation or make them give up such a title to nobility. But in order to render an accord easy, and taking into consideration the assurances mentioned in the fifth article of your letter, to keep and guard our mutual interests in that country as they are one and the same, for all these reasons we might agree to leave under the British administration for a short time those districts that are now occupied by British troops, without the rights of either side being prejudiced thereby (especially those of the Arab Nation, which interests are economic and vital to it), and against a sum paid as compen sation to the Arab Kingdom for the period of the occupation, in order to meet the expense which every new Kingdom is bound to support; at the same time respecting your agreements with the Sheikhs of those districts, and especially those which are essential” (p. 92). About the same date, in his conversations with Sir Mark Sykes, Faroki discussed the whole question of British priority of economic enterprise and administrative assistance in Mesopotamia, and of a similar position in Syria for France:— “ The Arabs would agree to a convention with France to allow her a monopoly of all concessionary enterprise in Palestine and Syria: the latter being defined as bounded as far south as Deir Zor by the Euphrates, thence to Deraa and to Maan along the Hejaz Raihvay. “ As far South as Maan the Hejaz Railway could be sold to French concessionnaires, Arabs further agreeing to employ in this area European employes and none but French as advisers. To be noted that Arabs only undertake to employ Europeans if they need them, but Faroki points out that the object of this stipulation is to avoid any appearance of control over them (Arabs). In this area the Arabs would agree to accord special recognition to all French educational establishments. “ As regards the remainder of the Greater Arabia (Irak and Jezireh and Northern Mesopotamia) the Arabs would agree to an identical convention with Great Britain” pp. 104).A in »i On the 13th December, 1915, in his third letter to the Sherif Sir H McMahon reserved the details of Great Britain’s position in Bagdad vilayet for tuture con- sideration:— “ The Government of Great Britain, as I have already informed you, are r ready to give ad guarantees of assistance and support within their power to the Arab Kingdom, but their interests demand, as you yourself have recognised a friendly and stable administration in the vilayet of Bagdad, and the adequate safeguarding of these interests calls for a much fuller a^id more detaded con sideration than the present situation and urgency of these negotiations permits (p. 103). On the 1st of January, 1916, in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon, the Sherif omitted further discussion of the conditions of British administration, and left the fixing of the financial compensation (which he had proposed, but to which ills Majesty s Government had not committed themselves) to His Majesty’s Government s discretion “ With regard to what had been stated in your honoured communication concerning al-Irak, as to the matter of compensation for the period of occupation, we, in order to strengthen the confidence of Great Britain in our attitude and in our words and actions, really and veritably, and in order to give her evidence of our certainty and assurance in trusting^ her glorious Government, leave t e determination of the amount to the perception of her wisdom and justice (p. 112 ). On the 30th January, 1916, Sir H. McMahon took note of this in his fourth lettei to the Sherif, and promised to “ take the question into careful consideration when the enemv has been defeated and the time for peaceful settlement arrives (p. 5, P ar ‘f H). On the 19th May, 1917, in conversation with Sir Mark Sykes and M. Picot, King Husein “ admitted the necessity for European advisers to heads of departments, and referred to Syria and Irak,” but he objected to the suggestion that these advisers must have executive authority. In an interview on the following day, a declaration by the King, in answer to a message from the French Governrqent which had been delivered to him by M. Picot, was read aloud to the following effect : — “ That His Majesty the King of Hejaz learned with satisfaction that the French Government approved of Arab national aspirations ; and that, as he had confidence in Great Britain, he would be content if the French Government pursued the same policy towards Arab aspirations on the Moslem Syrian Littoral as the British did in Bagdad.” On the same occasion Sherif Faisal delivered the following message from his father to Sir Mark Sykes :— “We are ready to co-operate with France in Syria to the fullest extent and with England in Mesopotamia ” lo King Husein’s view of the results of these two interviews is given in a report by Captain Lawrence of an illuminating conversation with him on the 29th July, 1917 : — 16 “The King is extremely pleased to have trapped M. Picot into the admission that France will be satisfied in Syria with the position that Great Britain desires in Iraq. That, he says, means a temporary occupation of the country for strategical and political reasons (with probably an annual grant to the Sherif in compensation and recognition), and concessions in the way of public works. ‘ I was ready without being asked to guard their interests in the existing railways, and assist their schools ; but the Hejaz and Syria are like the palm and fingers of one hand, and I could not have consented to the amputation of any finger or part of a finger without leaving myself a cripple.’ “ In conclusion, the Sherif remarked on the shortness and informality of conversations, the absence of written documents, and the fact that the only change in the situation caused by the meeting was the French renunciation ot the ideas of annexation, permanent occupation or suzerainty of any part of Syria—‘ but this we did not embody in a formal treaty, as the war is not finished. I merely read out my acceptance of the formula as the British in Iraq, proposed to me by M. Picot, since Sir Mark Sykes assured me that it would put a satisfactory conclusion to the discussion.’ ’’ 14 104269/17. 15 Irak only, or Irak aud Jezireh ? 16 174974/17.regard to Palestine, His Majesty’s Government are committed by Sir H.

That so far as Palestine is concerned, we are determined that no people shall be subjected to another, but that in view of the fact : (m) that there are in Palestine shrines, Wakfs, and Holy Places, sacred in some cases to Modems alone, to Jews alone, to Christians alone, and in others to two or all three, and inasmuch as these places are of interest to vast masses of people outside Palestine and Arabia, there must be a special regime to deal with these places approved of by the world. (h.) That as regards the Mosque ot Omar, it shall be considered as a Moslem concern alone, and shall not be subjected directly or indirectly to anv non-Moslem authority. “ That since the Jewish opinion of the world is in favour of a return of Jews to Palestine, and inasmuch as this opinion must remain a constant factor, and further, as His Majesty’s Government view with favour the realisation of this aspiration. His Majesty’s Government are determined that in so far as is compatible with the freedom of the existing population, both economic and political, no obstacle should be put in the way of the realisation of this id^al.” This message was delivered personally to King Husein by Commander Hogarth, and the latter reported on his reception of it as follows :— “ The King would not accept an independent Jewish State in Palestine, nor was I instructed to warn him that such a State was contemplated by Great Britain. He probably knows nothing of the actual or possible economy of Palestine, and his ready assent to Jewish settlement there is not worth very much. But I think he appreciates the financial advantage of Arab co-operation with the Jews.” Finally, it may be noted that King Husein was violently disturbed by the allusions to the Anglo-French Agreement of the Kith May, 1916, made in a speech by Jemal Pasha at Beirout on the 30th November, 1917, and reported in No. 101 of the “ Mustakbal,” of Paris . 1 ' 5 Jemal represented that Great Britain and France would so interpret their special position in Mesopotamia and Syria respectively as to confine King Husein’s effective power to the Hej az. In view of the King’s attitude towards this question recorded above, the effect upon him of Jemal’s insinuation was inevitable. Relation of Commitments regarding Mesopotamia under (iv.) to British Desiderata. Area. —His Majesty’s Government stipulated for “special measures of administra tive control ” in Basra and Bagdad vilayets. The Sherif, in his final statement on the subject on the 1 st January, 1916, referred to Irak, which is equivalent. N.B.—In November, Faroki talked to Sir Mark Sykes about a special position for Great Britain in “ Mesopotamia,” and the same word is used in Sir Mark Sykes’ report of the Sherif’s message to him on the 20 th May, 1917. It is not clear whether this is simply a rendering of “Irak” or is intended to include Jezireh. Terms. —Sherif Husein laid down no terms except a monetary compensation to himself (as representing the Arab Confederation) for the duration of the British control. He left the fixing of the amount to His Majesty’s Government. Flis Majesty’s Government have not committed themselves to such payment or to any other condition. Duration. —Throughout the negotiations the Sherif assumed that this would be limited, and it is clear from his conversation with Captain Lawrence that he regards it as understood that it shall be short. His Majesty’s Government, on their side, have committed themselves to no time limit whatsoever. (v.) Relation of Slier if Husein to Great Britain. In his first letter of July, 1915, Sherif Husein proposed that Great Britain should enjoy priority of economic enterpiise throughout the territory included within 17 245810/18. 18 123868/18: King’ Husein’s letter of the otti June, 1918, to Sir R. Wingate. [883] Dthe boundaries of Arab independence claimed by him (Proposal 2 ). In the same area lie asked for our assent to the abolition of the Capitulations, and our assistance in securing an “ International Convention ” to the same effect (Proposal 5).^ The proposal regarding the Capitulations was ignored by His Majesty s Government^ and does not appear to have been referred to again by the Sherif. With regard to British priority, which Sir H. McMahon proposed to extend to the political as well as the economic sphere (p. 50), the Foreign Office instructed him as follows in their telegram of the 20 th October, 191.5 : — “ Unless it is necessary in order to secure Arab consent, you should not include the stipulation that they will recognise British interests as paramount and work under British guidance. &amp;c. Such stipulation might give rise m France to the impression that we are aiming not only at the _ securing of Arab interests, but also at the establishment of our own interests in Syria at the expense of the French (p. 52). On the 24th October, 1915, in his second letter to the Sherif, Sir H. McMahon interpreted these instructions as follows :— “ When the situation admits, Great Britain will give to the Arabs her advice and will assist them to establish what may appear to be the most suitable forms of government in those territories. £C On the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that such European advisers and officials as may be required for the formation of a sound form of administration will be British” (p. 54). The point was taken up again in Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 860, of the 2 nd November, 1915, to Sir H. McMahon : “ I propose that my main object shall be to persuade the French Government to agree to include within the Arab boundaries the cities of Aleppo, Homs, Hama and Damascus. “ In order to gain this point, however, we must be ready to waive the condition that European officials and advisers of the Arab Government are to be only British, and that the Arabs are to turn to Great Britain alone for guidance and yd vice. “ I should like to know whether this condition was included not to meet the wishes of the Arabs, but merely for the sake of our own interests. If the hitter is the case and if by dropping it we can obtain the concurrence of the French Government in promising the four cities to the Arabs, I shall consider myself free to do so in consultation with Mr. Chamberlain (Secretary of Shite for India). “ To win the Arabs over to our side against the Turks is our vital and foremost object, not the acquisition of a new sphere of influence for ourselves ” (p. 60). This was answered by Sir H. McMahon on the 7 th November, 1915 :— “ It was at the express request of the Arabs that the clause concerning the advice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that all advisers and officials should be British, was included. They do not welcome the idea of French influence in the territories of the four cities, and were anxious to have British advisers, &amp;c., there—in fact, they wished the clause to apply to the whole of Arabia” (p. 61). This view was in a general way corroborated by a passage in a letter, dated the 28th December, 1916, from Sherif Husein to Sir Ali Morghani:— 1&lt;J &lt;£ It is impossible for us to acknowledge any other Power than Great Britain in our communications and representations. I say this from a purely economic point of view, but from the military point of view we none of us ignore the certainty that we shall stand in great need of the power of Great Britain to extinguish any trouble that is liable to break out in the interior of the country in the initial stages of so great changes ; more particularly because our friends 20 will not hesitate by all possible means to incite their own partisans against us for their own ends, in spite of the fact that they will have to defend their own interests in 19 30674/16. 20 ? The other independent Arab rulers.the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean until we become powerful enough to defend (them) ourselves. It is therefore necessary to take such action as will protect British interests and at the same time will preserve all the rights of independence” (p. 117). Later, on the occasion of the first French Mission to the Hejaz at the beginning of October, 1916, Sherif Husein consulted His Majesty’s Government through Abdullah as to the form of his reply to the greeting brought by rhe Mission from the French Government . 21 And in the same connection he informed Colonel Wilson at Jeddah that “he would much prefer that no one helped him except the British Government ” 22 Again, in telephone conversations on the 1 st November, 1916, and the 2 nd November, 1916, on the subject of Husein’s assumption of the Boyal title, Abdullah referred to Great Britain as “ our sole and respectable Ally,” and the King himself remarked that “ if any other Government were to ask him to do what he was doing now, he would not accept it, but knowing that the British Government was popular and just, he accepted to take it.” Such declarations must, of course, be discounted in view of the circumstances in which they were made and the fact that they were made by Orientals ; but there is little doubt that they represent the genuine desire of King Husein and his sons. Relation of Commitments under (v) to British Desiderata. His Majesty’s Government have committed themselves to no special position towards King Husein which is incompatible with their agreements with France. So long as our good relations with France do not suffer, it is clearly our interest that we should have a predominant position with King Husein and any other Arab rulers in the independent area. On the other hand, one of the King’s strongest motives for seeking to place us in a special position towards himself, as representative of the Arab movement throughout the-independent area, is the idea that he may eventually play us off against France. This appears, for example, in the following passage on the boundary question in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon of the 1 st January, 1916 : “ I do not find it necessary to draw your attention to the fact that our plan is of greater security to the interests and presumption of the rights of Great Britain than it is to us, and will necessarily be so whatever may happen, so that Great Britain may finally see all her own peoples in that contentment _and advancement which she is endeavouring to establish for them now; especially as her Allies being neighbours to us will be the germ of difficulties and discussion with which there will be no peace of mind. In addition to which the people of Beirout will decidedly never accept such isolation, and they may oblige us to undertake new measures which may exercise Great Britain, certainly not ^ less ^ than her present troubles, because of our belief and certainty in the reciprocity of qur interests, which is the only cause that caused us never to care to negotiate with any other Power but you ” (p. 113). His eagerness to deal solely witffius thus has its embarrassing side. (vi.) Sherif Rnsehi s Title. In his correspondence wdth SirH. McMahon Sherif Husein repeatedly declared himself to be speaking in the name of the Arab people. This claim was reiterated in each o his first four letters (pp. 40, 45, 46, 93, 95), as well as in his letter of the 28th Decem ber, 1915 to Sir Ali Morghani (p. 11 7). The most emphatic statement of it was perhaps the following:— “ Had it not been for the determination which I see in the Arabs for the attainment of their objects, I would have preferred to seclude myself on one of the heights of a mountain—but they, the Arabs, have insisted that I shou d gui e the movement to this end ’’ (p. 95). On the question of the boundaries of Arab independence, he was at particular pains to make it clear that he was not putting forward mere personal demands but acting as mandatory of the Arab inhabitants of the territories in question. ^ . This claim was based on his relations with the Arab Nationalist organisations, civilian and military, which had sprung up in the Arab provinces of Turkey with tieu* si 201319/16. 23 220970/16.12 centre at Damascus, and which in the summer of 1915 (when the military strength of the Turks was concentrated at the Dardanelles, at the opposite extremity ot the Lmpire) were a more elective political factor than at any time before or since. From Faroki’s statement , 20 we know that the Damascus Committee had given their allegiance to Sherif Husein before he opened negotiations with Sir H. McMahon, and^ that the terms he put forward (particularly on the question of boundaries) were largely suggested by them. He virtually declared this in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon, on the 1 st January, 1916 :— “ Your Honour will have realised after the arrival of Mohammed (Faroki) Sherif and his interview with you, that all our procedure up to the present was ot no personal inclination or the like, which would have been wholly unintelligible, but that everything was the result of the decisions and desires of our peoples, and that we are but transmitters and executants of such decisions and desires in the position they (our people) have pressed upon us. _ , “ These truths are in my opinion very important and deserve Tour Honours special attention and consideration ” (p. 111 ). This explains the large pretensions (otherwise difficult to uncierstand) with which the Sherif started and which he has never given up. But oefore the Sheiifs revolt in the Hejaz came to a head, the movement in Syria, from which his initiative had come, was crushed by the Turks. From Faroki's statement it appears that the mihtaiy branch was broken up about August 1915, while the civilian leaders were mostly hanged or deported in February 1916. 2 * In his fifth letter to Sir H. McMahon of the 18th February, 1916, the Sherif mentioned that the Syrian movement had practically been stamped out (p. 6 , Part II), and in another letter, dated the 29th^ Maich, 1916, he stated that the Syrians were now incapable of action. 2, ( His Majesty s Government on their part discouraged the Sherif from a forward policy in Syria on the eve of his revolt, both on military grounds and for fear of political complications with France . 26 Thus, during the period between the beginning of the negotiations in July 1915,^ and the outbreak of the revolt in the Hejaz in June 1916, the relative importance of the Syrian movement dwindled while that of the Sherif increased ; and when the question was raised of sending Faroki and al Masri, as representatives of the movement, to Basra to get into touch with the Arabs in the Turkish Army on that front, His Majesty’s Government referred to the Sherif’s claim to represent the Arab nation, and laid down their policy as follows :— 2 ' &lt;£ While there is no clear evidence as to how far this claim accords with facts, it has not been questioned by His Majesty’s Government. If the claim be well founded, it is a matter for consideration whether independent assurances should be given to other and ex-hypothesi less responsible Arabs.” When, therefore, the Sherif threw of! his allegiance to Turkey, he found his effective sovereignty confined to the Hejaz, as Amir ol which he was merely one among a number of independent Arab rulers, who divided between them the allegiance of the tribes and oases of the Arabian Peninsula. The Arabs of Syria and Jezireh, whose allegiance had promised to make him the indisputable leader of the National Movement in the (Asiatic) Arab countries, were still under the heel of the Turk, with no immediate prospect of liberation. But the title to leadership which they had enabled him to assume had been confirmed by the relations into which he had meanwhile entered with His Majesty’s Government; and this, together with his prestige as hereditary guardian of the Holy Cities, made it difficult for him to accept bin Saud, the Imam, the Idrisi, etc., who were his equals in fact, as his peers in honorary rank. These facts explain the problems that have arisen over his title and his relations with the other independent Arab Chiefs. On the 5 th August, 1916, in a telegram of thanks to His Majesty the King for his congratulations on the success of the Hejaz revolt, Husein signed himself, entirely correctly, as “ Sherif and Amir of Mecca,” 28 and the same signature appeared under a proclamation he issued next month to the people of Irak . 29 23 157740/15; cp. 152729/15: Telegram of the 10th October, 1915, from General Maxwell to Lord Kitchener. 24 The Turkish account of the Arab movement is given in - Verne sur la question Syrienne ” (Sta eoul: 1916, issued by the Fourth Turkish Army Command). 25 71430/16. 26 76013/16; 81915/16 ; 95496/16; 107904/16. 27 54229/16 : Foreign Office telegram No. 262 of the 5th April, 1916, to Sir ii.

'v Arabs, to me 1 us according to the law of God and His Prophet, and we swear to you the oath of loyalty and obedience, secretly and openly; and in addition we consider you as a final religious authority, which iact we have agreed upon pending M the decision of the Moslem World regarding the Caliphate.” 30 Sherif Husein declared on his part:— this sentiment of loyalty does not belong only to the inhabitants of this country, but the Arabs of Syria, and Irak likewise are yearning to be united with us and to restore their freedom and glory. I have received messages from their notables to this effect.” On the same day Sherif Abdullah telegraphed as follows to Sir H. McMahon and to the Governments of all Allied and Neutral countries :— “ Je suis tres heureux de vous informer que les notables, les ulemas du pays et toutes les classes de la population, s’etant reunis aujourd’hui, ont a runanimite reconnu Sa Majeste le Grand Cherif Hussein-ben-Aly l Boi de la nation arabe.' Sa Majeste devient de ce fait Souverain des Arabes, etant donne que le pays est penetre de sa capacite diplomatique, de sa, parfaite loyaute envers sa patrie, et de son desir sincere de repandre les hienfaits de rinstruction et de la justice dans toutes les regions arabes delivrees du joug de la bande Union et Progres. “ La nation arabe a tout lieu d’esperer que vous la reconnaitrez membre actif dans la societe des nations, et eonnue telle. Eile le prouvera dans favenir. “ Avee fappui du Tout-Puissant, veuillez agreer, etc. (Signe) “Le Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres du Gouvernement arabe, le Gherif Abdullah.” 31 Sherif Husein was duly crowned “King of the Arabs” at Mecca, on the 4th November, 19 In, 33 and there was a simultaneous ceremony at Jeddah, which was not, however, attended by the French and British representatives. 33 On the 2 nd November, 1916, in his telegram No. 961 to the Foreign Office, Sir H. McMahon suggested that, in view of our treaties recognising the independence of other Arab Chiefs, we could only recognise Sherif Husein as “ King (Malik) of the Hejaz ”. 34 On the 3rd November, 1916, the Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir H. McMahon (No. 880) that the Sherif might be congratulated but not yet accorded recognition, and that the French Government desired to conform their action to that of His Majesty’s Government . 36 On the 6 th November, 1916, the Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir P. Wingate (Khartoum) the following instructions for a reply to Sherit Abdullah on behalf of the Governments of Great Britain, France and Russia :— 36 “ His Majesty’s Government and the Governments of France and Russia, though they regard, and will continue to regard, His Highness as the titular head of the Arab peoples in their revolt against Turkish misrule, and are glad further to recognise him as the lawful and de facto ruler of the Hejaz, are unable to recognise the assumption by him of any sovereign title which might provoke disunion among Arabs at the present moment and thus prejudice the final political settlement of Arabia on a satisfactory basis. That settlement, to be durably, must be come to with the general assent of other Arab rulers, of which at present there is no evidence, and must follow, rather than precede, military success.” On the 9th November, 1916, Sir H. McMahon telegraphed to the Foreign Office (No. 991) demurring to the expression “ titular head ” ; and the French Government proposed the substitution for the words “ Arab race ” of the , words “ population of Arabia.” 37 30 249121/16.

[883] EOn the 15th November, 19 L 6 , Lord Bertie telegraphed that the French Govern' ment had instructed Colonel Bremond not to address the Sherif as “ His Majesty.” 38 On the 27th November, 1916, the French Government suggested to His Majesty’s Government, through their Ambassador in London, that Sherif Husein’s title should be “Malik al Haramein ” (King of the two Holy Cities) and ids style SiyadiyL . (“ Seigneurie,” or “ Lordship ”). 39 On the 4th December, 1916, Sir B. Wingate telegraphed (No. 53) that, in the reply from His Majesty’s Government to the Sherif, which by this time had been despatched, ^ he had styled him “ Sahib al Siyada.” But he criticised the proposed title of “ Malik al Haramein ” on account of its possible religious connotation . 40 It was also objected to on the same grounds by Sir H. McMahon and by the India Office , 41 and both proposed independently the title “ King of the Hejaz,” which had been Sir H. McMahon’s original suggestion. A telegram was accordingly sent to Sir R. Wingate instructing him to address the Sherif as “His Lordship ” (Siyada) “the King (Malik) of Hejaz,” and this style and title have been adhered to since . 42 At the same time Colonel Wilson was instructed, at the suggestion of the India Office, to explain to the Sherif that the limitation of the title did not affect the Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and him . 43 The Sherif did not question His Majesty’s Government’s decision (.presumably because he knew himself to have been in the wrong in acting without their knowledge), but it is evident that he considers that the wider title is properly his. For example, in January, 1917, he seems to have composed a second message to the people of Irak in which he signed himself “ King of the Arab country and Sherif and Amir of Mecca.” 44 Again, when he was asked by Commander Hogarth in January, 1918, 45 to compose a message for the Arabs of Jerusalem, he proposed to sign it as “ King of the Arabs ” or “ of the Arab nation ” ; and even when he abandoned this signature, he drafted the message in terms which implied this title so patently that he had to be prevailed upon to draft it again. “ It is obvious,” Commander Hogarth wrote, in his report to Sir R. Wingate on this mission, “that the King regards Arab unity as synonornous with his own kingship, and as a vain phrase unless so regarded. . . C . 7 : b ' “ While the King accepted without demur His Majesty’s Government’s declaration on this matter, as conveyed in Foreign Office telegram No. 6 of the 6 th November, 1916, to yourself, he left me in little doubt that he secretly regards this as a point to be reconsidered after the Peace, in spite of my assurance that it was to be a definitive arrangement. He compared ourselves and himself (in his habitual homely way) to two persons about to inhabit one house but not agreed -which should take which floor or rooms. Often in the course of our conversations he spoke with a smile of accounts which he would settle after the war, pending which settlement he would press nothing. I doubt if he has any fixed plan or foresees his way ; but I have no doubt that in his own mind he abates none of his original demands on behalf of the Arabs, or in the fulness of time, of himself.” llelation of Commitments under (vi.) to British Desiderata. His^ Majesty’s Government avoided according Sherif Husein a title incompatible with their commitments to other independent Arab rulers, while the title which they have recognised does not conflict with the wider claims of the Sherif to which they consented in the previous negotiations. But though His Majesty’s Government’s position on this question may be satis factory jan paper, it is far from being so in fact. the harm done by the Sherifs coup d Etat of the 29th October, 1916, has never been repaired. The other independent Arab mlers have not been inwardly reassured by our restriction of the Sherif s title to the Hejaz; while he, on his part, has only accepted this restriction as provisional. The problem has been postponed, not solved. 38 230285/16. 39 240161/16. 40 214179/16.

The boundaries of Arab independence assented to by Sir H. McMahon on the 24th Octobei, 1915, in his second letter to Sherif Tlusein, included not only (a) Arab territoixes still^subject to the lurk, but also ( 6 ) the dominions of independent Arab rulers like the foultans of Mokglla and Maskat, the Trueial Chiefs, and the Sheikh of Koweit, with whom His Majesty s Government had treaties, in some cases of more than half a century s standing; and (c) the dominions of Arab rulers, like bin Saud and the Idnsp whom His Majesty s Government had recognised before the war as being within the Tuikish sphere, but with whom we had since made agreements, or were on the point of making them. (The Treaty with the Idrisi was signed on the 30th April, 1915, before Sherif Husein had opened negotiations with us, and that with bin Saud on the 20 th December, 1915, before we had concluded them with him.) Sir H. McMahon, therefore, stated in his letter that “we accept these limits and boundaries without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab Chiefs” (p. 53). 1 he point does not appear to have been taken up by the Sherif until his third letter of the 5th November, 1915, in which, apropos of British administration in Irak, he wrote that he might consent to it “for a short time, without the rights of either side being prejudiced thereby (especially those of the Arab Nation, which interests are economic and vital to it) ... . at the same time respecting your agreements with the Sheikhs of those districts, and especiallv those which are essential”(p. 93 ). On the 10th December, 1915, the Foreign Office, in a telegram of instructions to Sir H. McMahon, laid it down that:— ' It should be made clear to the Sherif that when we spoke of our existing agreements with Sheikhs being upheld, we referred to the Arabian Peninsula no less than Mesopotamia ” (p. 102). And in his third letter of the 13th December, 1915, Sir H. McMahon embodied these instructions as follows :— “ In stating that the Arabs are ready to recognise and respect all our treaties with Arab Chiefs, it is of course understood that this will apply to all territories included in the Arab Kingdom, as the Government of Great Britain cannot repudiate engagements which already exist.” This stipulation was ignored by the Sherif in his fourth letter of the 1 st November, 1916, and dots not appear to have been referred to again during the negotiations. After the outbreak of the revolt and the reduction, of the Turkish garrisons at Mecca, Jeddah and Taif, Abdullah, as Sherifial “ Minister for Foreign Affairs,” appears to have sent messages announcing the victory to the neighbouring Arab rulers, to which both bin Saud and the chief of the Hashid and Bekil Confederation sent extremely courteous, though non-committal, replies . 46 Bin Saud was also informed of the Hejaz revolt officially by His Majesty’s Government through Sir P. Cox. In his reply to the latter , 47 dated the 20 th July, 1916 (or 25th July, 1916), he expressed pleasure at the event as a blow to the Turks and a success for His Majesty’s Government, but intimated doubts as to Sherif Husein’s intentions, mentioned that he and the Sherif had been at war for years over demarcation and allegiance questions, and took exception to the fact that “ in the official communique mention was made of c the Arabs’ as if they w T ere a compendious whole.” Early in August, 1916, Sherif Husein appears to have written a second letter to bin Saud, asking for “ alliance ” and “ assistance.” Bin Saud reported this to Sir P. Cox in a letter dated the 1 5 th August, 1916, and expressed even graver concern at the Sherifs intentions than before . 48 Sir P. Cox submitted that His Majesty’s Government should assure bin Saud that their treaty with him would be adhered to, and that they should communicate the terms of it to the Sherif. Both Sir P. Cox’s suggestions were adopted , 49 and the text of His Majesty’s Government’s treaty with bin Saud was conveyed to the Sherif by Colonel Wilson on the 30th October, 1916. 50 On the 1 st November, 1916, Sherif Abdullah, in his telephonic communication to Colonel Wilson , 51 regarding the proclamation of his father as “ King of the Arabs ” two days before, defined the position of the other independent Arab rulers as follows :— 46 Translations in 242002/16. 47 182436/16; full translation in 231939/16 (No. 52). *8 180581/16. 49 183725/16 and 187737/16. 50 219296/16. 61 242002/16.C£ As for bin Sand, he is a Sheikh of Arabs and the Sherif does not interfere with his work or his land. Let every one rule his part, it does not make any difference. _ n (£ As for the Idrisi, he is a man who is not recognised by anyone to he anything. He has made himself Sheikh and landed in some places which were not ruled by anyone. “As for Imam Yahya, let him govern his part of the land, but he will not deny the fact that the Amir of Mecca should be the ruler of Hejaz and King of Arabs. “ As for the Arab tribes, none of them would oppose the Sherif’s declaring himself King of the Arabs. “ The history of the Amir of Mecca goes back to the Abhasides. “ It is not important whether these people would agree or not.” In his telephonic conversation later on the same day he added the following somewhat more satisfactory but still equivocal assurances :— “ Bin Saud, Idrisi, &amp;c., are rulers in their places, and we would not interfere with them. They are respected, and if anyone were to attack them we have to help them. “ Our boundaries were settled before the rising, and therefore we have no other ambition, as terms were concluded before that Kingdom of the Sherif will he up to Iraq. “ Our respect to this treaty concluded between us and Great Britain forbids us to oppose them, and such is well known to you.’ This attitude was confirmed by Sherif Huseiu himself in a letter to Colonel Wilson dated the 4th November, 1916, and'he defended it by enclosing copies of the letters to him from bin Saud and the chief of the Hashid and Bekil Confederation, referred to above. These letters had, of course, no bearing on the assumption of the title “ King of the Arabs,” since they were written several months before, on the occasion of his revolt against the Turks. Oil the 6th November, 1916, His Majesty’s Government took note of Abdullah’s assurances, such as they were, in their instructions to Sir B. Wingate for the official reply to Abdullah’s circular telegram announcing the assumption of the royal title. 03 Meanwhile, bin Saud had apparently answered the Sherif’s second letter to him by expressing readiness to co-operate, but asking for assurances that the Sherif would no lorger encroach on what bin Saud regarded as his own tribal sphere. The Sherif returned this letter unanswered with a “ most discourteous and arrogant ” covering note. 53 And he sent equally unsatisfactory replies to congratulatory letters from the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit. 54 Upon receiving a report of this from the India Office, the Foreign Office tele graphed the following message to the Sirdar on the 25th November, 1916 (No. 24), 5o for transmission to the Sherif:— “ His Majesty’s Government learnt with great regret that the three great Arab Chiefs, the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit and bin Saud, have reason to feel aggrieved at the reception of their advances by the Sherif. His Majesty’s Government are convinced that such an incident is entirely contrary to the wishes and intentions of the Sherif himself, and that it is no doubt due to an oversight on the part of his subordinates; but they must observe that, in view of the very satisfactory attitude of the three Sheikhs in question, the Sherif’s own interests, no less than courtesy towards His Majesty’s Government, require him to meet the advances of the King’s Allies with civility and even with cordiality. His Majesty’s Government are using all their influence to secure the cordial co-opera tion of all Arabs with the Sherif, but their efforts will be of no avail if the Sherif himself repels those whom His Majesty’s Government have attracted to his support.” In response to this message, the Sherif sent two telegrams to the three Sheikhs, the one congratulating them in turn on their conference with Sir P. Cox at Koweit in 53 22186H/16. 53 236884/16 Telegram of the 21st November, 1917. from Sir l 3 . Cox. 54 It does not appear whether the congratulations were for the Sherif’s coronation or for some previous- eve! it. 55 236884/16.. ^ 0 ™ mber ’ the oth f making fairly satisfactory amends for his previous behaviour - In the second telegram he explained his relation to the general movement for Arab Independence in the tol owing terms, which are practically identical with those employe*, during his negotiations with His Majesty’s Government Y ° 1 ’ au d 1 are friends and Allies of the British Government, the powerful nend of the Arabs, and we should unite and co-operate with each other to expel ^ the iurkish tricksters, our personal enemies and the enemies of the truth and to purge the Arab country from their vileness and iniquity. This is the first necessity and everything else will follow. I have absolutely no personal ambition in t us matter; my objects are to secure our safety (yours and my own), and the integrity ot the Arabian country and its purification from the wickedness and series (? the lies) of the deceitful Turks.” . ^ e . 12t ^ December, 1916, the Sheikh of Kuweit returned a suitable reply, and this particular incident was closed . 58 The relations of Sherif Husein with the' ldrisi and bin mmd however, have caused His Majesty’s Government perpetual difficulties. Un the 20 th May, 1917, on the occasion of the meeting between the Sherif and M. Picot and Sir Mark Sykes at Jeddah , 69 Faisal gave Sir Mark Sykes the following message Irom his father :— We are ready to co-operate with France in Syria to the fullest extent and Kngktnd m Mesopotamin, hut we ask for help from England with Idrisi and bin baud, without in any way infringing on their independence. We beg that Gieat Britain will endeavour to induce them to recognise King’s position as leader of Arab movement.” The Foreign Office consulted with the India Office as to how far it was possible to obtain recognition from the Idrisi and bin Saud of Sherif Husein’s special position as leader of the Arab movement, 00 and the question was referred respectively to the ^Resident at Aden and to Sir P. Cox. Both reported that the moment was inopportune, and the matter was not proceeded with. 61 The difficulties between the Sherif and the Idrisi over Kunfida in August, 1916, 63 and between the Sherif and bin Saud over Khorma in the summer of 1918, do not fill within the scope of the present section. They were essentially demarcation and allegiance disputes between the Sherif, in his quality of a local Arab ruler, and his nearest neighbours, and the question of his rank and relation to the Arab Movement was not technically involved. There is no doubt, however, that these and other disputes of the kind have been and will he considerably embittered by the presence of this larger question in the background. Relation of Commitments under (viij to British Desiderata. All commitments hitherto made by His Majesty’s Government to the Sherif on the one part and the other independent Arab rulers on the other appear to be compatible with one another. On the. other hand, the problem of retaining the goodwill of the Sherif and securing him the position required by British and French desiderata in Mesopotamia, Palestine and Syria, while at the same time retaining the confidence of the other independent Chiefs, remains unsolved. (viii.) The Caliphate. On the 31st October, 1914, Lord Kitchener, in his second message to Sherif Abdullah wrote —- !&lt; It may be that an Arab of true race will assume the Khalifate at Mecca or Medina, and so good may come by the help of God out of all the evil that i^how occurring.” On the strength of this message, Abdullah, on the occasion of King Husein’s coronation in November 1916, and His Majesty’s Government’s message of congratulation 56 241296/16. 5 7 243796/16. 5 8 251680/16. 59 104269/17. 60 117999/17. 61 126031/17, 137978/17, 141413/17 (the Idrisi) and 152629/17, 118989/17, 119702/17 (biu iSaud). 62 182183/16 aud 215155/16 (No. 142). [883] Fon that event, telegraphed in Huseins name to Colonel Wilson at Jeddah, conveying thanks to His Majesty’s Government which once addressed him as Caliph. b: When pressed on the point by Colonel Wilson, Abdullah admitted over the telephone that no letter was ever addressed to Sherif Husein as Caliph, and quoted the text of Lord Kitchener’s message with sufficient accuracy. 04 ... f That message, did not, of course, commit His Majesty’s Government to more than the pious hope that the question of the Caliphate would he dealt with in a certain manner by the Moslems themselves. But the incident mentioned above shows how dangerous even the most guarded reference to the Caliphate by His Majesty’s Govern ment may be, and it is a danger that will increase as we approach the peace settlement. Any possible ambiguity in Lord Kitchener’s message was removed by His Majesty’s Government’s more detailed declaration in the same sense, convened m toe Foieign Office Telegram No. 173 of the 14th April, 1915, to Sir H. McMahon: “ His Majesty’s Government consider that the question of Khalifate is one which must be decided by Mohammedans themselves without interference^ ot non- Mohammedan Powers. Should the former decide for an Arab Khalifate, that decision would therefore naturally be respected by His Majesty s Government, but the decision is one for Mohammedans to make ” (p. 30). This declaration evoked an important memorandum, dated the 6 th May, 1915, from Sir Ah Morghani, Grand Kadi of the Sudan, in which he argued that Sherif Husein was the most suitable candidate for the Caliphate, and that if he received unobtrusive support from His Majesty’s Government, he had good prospects of obtaining recognition from a majority of Islam, (pp. 32 seqq.) In July 1915, in his hist letter to Sir H. McMahon, Sherif Husein demanded that “ England should approve of the proclamation of an Arab Caliphate of Islam (p. 40). In this he was no doubt encouraged by Lord Kitchener s message, and stimulated by his own ambition for the office, but it appears that he was also prompted, as he was on the boundary question, by the Nationalist Committee at Damascus. Faroki, in his statement at Cairo in October 1915 , 60 mentioned that when he was stationed at Damascus (apparently early in the winter of 1914—15, before the first Turkish attack on the Canal) he found that the civilian committee there “ had already paid allegiance to the Sherif of Mecca as Caliph and renounced allegiance to Reshad the Sultan of Turkey. Our first action, therefore, after joining that society was that we sent an officer to the Sherif of Mecca, and he paid him allegiance on behalf of all the officers in our party and renounced our allegiance to Reshad.” He further stated that one of the formal aims of the Arab Party was that “ Sherif Husein of Mecca should be Caliph and Sultan of the new Empire.” In conversation with General Clayton he added that :— “ The members of the Society have taken a solemn oath on the Koran that they will enforce their object and establish an Arab Caliphate in Arabia, Syria, and Mesopotamia at all costs and under any circumstances, sacrificing for this object all their efforts and property and, if need be, their lives.” The fact, which thus seems established, that Sherif Husein, before opening negotiations with us, was offered the Caliphate by an organisation which might reason ably claim at that time to represent the Arab nation in the Ottoman provinces, at any rate in Syria, may be of some importance when the question comes up for settlement. On the 30th August, 1918, Sir H. McMahon, in his first letter to the Sherif, answered the latter’s demand regarding the Caliphate by repeating Lord Kitchener’s message to Abdullah. He interpreted this as “ approval of the Arab Caliphate when it should be proclaimed,” and added : “ We declare on«.e more that His Majesty’s Government would welcome the resumption of the Caliphate by an Arab of true race'’ (P- 4 3). On the 2nd November, 1915, 66 the Aga Khan called on Sir E. Grey and protested againft the idea of an Arab Caliphate in the name of the Indian Moslems, and Sir E. Grev gave him an assurance in the following terms :— £ ’ I said that we were prepared to favour an independent or autonomous Arabia in the country inhabited by the Arabs; but anything that we promised to ^ the Arabs, or any action that we took to support them, would be of a political and 88 224419/16 aud 224579/16. 64 226649/16. 65 157740/15. «« 164776/15.seoular character We regarded the Khalifate as a thing which should be settled by Moslems for themselves, and m which neither we nor any non-Moslem Power should interfere. The Ap Khan expressed himself quite satisfied, but asked that, in all communi- -v cations With the Arabs, His Majesty’s Government’s attitude should be made very clear A record of this conversation was transmitted to Sir H. McMahon and Sir K. Wingate! On the Wth November, 1915, after receiving from Sir H. McMahon a revised A summary of the Sherif s third letter of the 5 th November, 1915, the Foreign Office telegraphed to the former (No. 8 S 7) 67 : “You will,_ of course, bear carefully, in mind the necessity of avoiding all possibility of being involved in any question's concerning the Caliphate.” I he subject was accordingly ignored by Sir H. McMahon in the subsequent negotiations. ' y _ Sherif Husem, however, gave a clearer indication of his policy on the question in his letter of the 28th December, 1915, to Sir Ali Morghani 68 “ I had not claimed before to be the qualified chief of the Amirs (the Caliph), but I explained to them more than once that I was ready to extend my hand to any man who would come forward and take the reins of authority. I was, however, chosen in every quarter and even forced to take up the question of their future^ prospects ; and, therefore, I can see no ground for making (further) conditions, such as the universal agreement of the Amirs and tribes which were mentioned, especially the ‘ Shias,’ i.e., the Persians, who lack the necessary qualifications and every other right (to decide the question of the chosen Caliph of Islam) ” (p. 118). The above passage lends significance to the declaration contained in the address presented to Sherif Husein on the 29th October, 1916, by the “Ministers, Notables, Inhabitants and Ulema of Mecca ,” 69 to the effect that “We take the oath of obedience, loyalty and sincerity to Husein bin Ali, and consider him also to be our religious leader until all the Moslem world be of one opinion concerning the Islamic Caliphate.” And Sherif Abdullah emphasised this declaration in his short telegram of the 29th October, 1916, to Colonel Wilson, announcing the proclamation of his father as king. In conversation over the telephone with Colonel Wilson on the 1 st November, 1916, 70 Abdullah explained that:— “His Majesty the Sherif has left the question of the Caliphate to the opinion of the Moslem world, and, therefore, he declared that there was no pre-suggested Caliphate, but that the whole question is left to the public opinion of Islam, and the Ulema of the Qibla decided not to accept the Turkish Caliphate, and the' whole question will come back later on to its origin.” In a similar conversation on the following day, King Husein himself declared:— “ I have denied the Caliphate entirely and officially, leaving it to the opinion of those who know ail about its regulations, until all Moslems choose one person to be their Caliph “I repeat that our not declaring the Caliphate will not put us in any suspicion, until all Moslems are of one opinion. It is a question of dissociating the Moslems from the Turks.” On the 6 th November, 1916, the Foreign Office telegraphed instructions to Sir R. Wingate for a reply to Abdullah’s communication 71 ; and in this telegram His Majesty’s Government’s policy regarding the Caliphate was once more laid down, as follows :— “ That it should be strongly impressed on the Sherif that his own interests require that the question of the Caliphate should be left open until the end of the war ; that it would be quite impossible for Christian Powers, numbering among their subjects many millions of Moslems, to expose themselves to the charge of taking sides in the affairs of Islam and forcibly supporting one Caliph against another, and that his claims could only be weakened by such support in the eyes of the Moslem world.” 67 172416/15. 08 30674/16. 69 233117/16; see also 249121/16 (extract from “ A1 Qibla”). 70 242002/16. 71 221869/16.A reply in this sense was eventually conveyed to King Husein by Colonel Wilson. 72 In his conversation with Colonel Wilson on the 2nd November 1916, quoted above, the Sherif twice spoke of the Caliphate as being in abeyance, and mentioned that he possessed a book by a Wahabi authority in which this was demonstrated, and which he would publish if necessary. He developed this thesis further in a conversation with Captain Lawrence on the 28th July 1917, 73 and the latter received the impression that he was genuinely aver se from the idea of reviving the office in his own person. For the “ false Caliphate ” of the Osmanlis he would prefer, it seems, to substitute a spiritual leadership of Islam in his own family with some such title as Amir al Muminin, if this were genuinely offered to him. His view appears to be that the spiritual leader of Islam should not aim at being the political sovereign of the whole Moslem world, but that tire office should be combined with a small temporal sovereignty—for instance, over the Hejaz and its Holy Cities—in order to secure the holder of it the independence necessary to his position. In fact, according to this conversation, Sherif Husein aims at a position very like that of the Papacy when it possessed the temporal power over the Estates of the Church. If this is the Sherif’s real view, it is remarkably divergent from the chauvinistic trend of opinion concerning the Caliphate which seems to be more common among Moslems at present. And it remains to be seen how he would regard the title of Caliph if it were actually placed within his grasp. delation of commitments under (viii) to British desiderata. His Majesty’s Government have succeeded so far in making it clear that they regard the question of the Caliphate as a purely Moslem affair, without causing Sherif Husein to doubt their goodwill towards his aspirations in the matter. We have two purely negative desiderata—avoidance of offence on the one hand to Moslem opinion and on the other hand to the Sherif—which have to be reconciled with one another, and hitherto we have avoided committing ourselves in either direction in a way that would compromise us in the other. o 72 There appears to be uo record in the Foreign Office of the final text of this note, the drafting of which was lett to the discretion of Sir R. Wingate, Colonel Bremond, and Colonel Wilson. 3 174h74/l71. At the meeting held at the Foreign Office on Saturday 17th, the Treasury representative did not question the necessity of paying the sums disbursed to Ibn Saud but stated that the only fund to vhich the Treasury could debit the expenditure is the accrued surplus from Mesopotamia at present in the hands of the Treasury. 2. Hie position, as I understand it, is that this surplus which is the balance over and above the cost of tie Civil administration of Mesopotamia is at the absolute disposal of His Majesty f s Government and it would be • expedient to reduce this balance by debiting against it political expenditure contingent to the campaign. 3. I stated at the Conference that I had no authority to pledge the India Office but would support the proposd in the Department. 4. If this view is accepted yaw* we may ask that the whole of Ibn Baud’s subsidy be debited against this surplus (which is understood to be approximately £1,000,000 5. There remains the suggestion in F.O.letter that Ibii Saud has been unreasonable Tf anyone has been unreasonable it is rather King Hussein who refused our overtures at an earlier stage. It would be obviously impossible to retain the confidence of Ibn Saud and reduce his subsidy while the controversy is still sub judice • and King Hussein continues to receive his monthly payment of £25,000. If when conditions supervene all subsidies are reduced or discontinuedythere will be reasonable grounds for reconsidering the situation, Till then we must, it is submitted, continue to pay Ibn Saud. 6.

The points in the Civil Commissioner T s telegram of 11 th January/' regarding which some doubt was felt have been discussed with Mr. Philby^ and Mr.Montagu is now in a position to make what it is hoped will prove a final and complete statement of the payments in money and kind made to Ibn Saud. The total payments made on this account amount now to some £265,000, composed as follows:- subsidy at £5,000 per mensem from January 1917, to March 1920 inclusive, £195,000j payments shown in Appendix iy to the Report on the Uejd Mission, about £42,500; costs of tents, rice sugar and coffee, about £6,500; cost of arms' arms and ammunition, £ 21 &lt; , 000 . Mr.Montagu much regrets that the fact that the Treasury*s sanction to the payment of a subsidy to Ibn Saud was * limited to a period of six months in the first instance was overlooked at the time when an extension of the sanction became necessary.

I have the honour to aoknowXedge receipt of your oordiaX letter dated 16th Safar 1338, (= 10th November 1919) contents of which I have fully noted, especially regarding the telegrams received by you from the Hon’ble Civil Oommissioner at Baghdad stating that according to a report from His Majesty's representa tive at Jiddah, I had appointed an official at Tara bah who was collecting taxes and blocking the road from Yemen, and that His Majesty's representative considered the withdrawal of the official necessary* He further reports that aharif Husain is willing to give an undertaking that no body shell occupy Sarabah until the question of boundaries is decided* Yes, I may inform you that I trust and believe in all officials of the High Government, both His Majesty's representative in Jiddah, and all other Political Officers, also you who are His Majesty's official, and I humbly, say and believe, that none of them consider any thing except peace, honour and tranquility of us Arabs generally; but we Arabs are perhaps not deserving of this for as the poet says 'If the habits are bad no training csn be of any use'. It is therefore well proved to me that all this is baseless talk on the part of the Sharif, it is rather strange that he should talk like he does when no tax has been collected from the inhabitants of Sarabah or Al-khurmah; firstl*. neither I nor the Sharif have been collecting any taxes from those places, and secondly , neither of us can levy any taxes on those places, as the question concerns the inhabitants of those towns only. It has been the practice from the time of our fathers and grand fathers to levy no taxes on the aforesaid places, (neither Qia the Turks ever do so), but in the p&amp;st it has been the Custom for the AJairs ofT 0! 3 SJarabah and Khurmah to receive the revenues for themselves, which revenues are in reality quite small in amount. Furthermore neither the Sharif nor his predecessors the Ashr&amp;fs had ever any power to take any such taxes; but on the contrary they used to make presents from their own property to the inhabitants of the towns in question in order to keep* them quiet, and in order that they should keep their roads •afe. Over and above all this when Abdullah son of the Sharif occupied £&amp;rabah for three days before the attack of the Ikhwan on him, he plundered property, demolished buildings, and slaughtered human beings. I can swear by Sod, that when we entered the townin question afterwards we could not find any kind of ft foodstuffs, neither little nor much, and even salt could not be found except what was brought from Uajd. ^he present condition of the place being so bad, how can he possibly claim that taxes are being collected by me. Any person of Hijaa and Ua^d would be willing to come forward and give voluntary evidence to the above effect. As regards the blocking of roads; by the Almighty Sod, it is a most astonishing thing that the Sharif should attribute such a thing to me; seeing that ever since his own policy failed, end his own subjects began to hate him, not only the Yemen road, but Mecca and the whole of the Hijaz and also Medina have become lawless. this on account of his bad treatment of the inhabitants of these places. The robbers are those whom he himself has strenghened by the supply of arms, and corrupted to his own disadvantage. These are they who plunder what comes in their way, and make the roads unsafe. How can he therefore dare to attx£bute to me an action which he has committed. As regards myself 1 do not commit this sort of thing, for two reasons; firstly owing to my Religion which makes me worship Sod, secondly because it is most unlawful for any Moslim, and contrary to the principles of our religion entirely, to block the ro&amp;d to the Holy Place or to make any kind of aggression, this out of fear of §od and from respect for the Holy House of Sod. Moreover i f 1; 1 lit •11 'ii 4|Moreover I m&amp;y also further state that I remain absol' loyal in^the promises made to His Majesty*s Government, insha illah, but. the object of the gharif is only to annoy and transgress by his meaningless statements, which contain no truth. His Object being Firstly he is like a man who is at the lowest bottom of earth and desires to lay hands on the sky, and secondly he is ambitious to be King of all the Arabs; but God forbid, insha Allah, this will for as long as any of them are alive, for he is both leaving modesty aside, and is following the Devils guidance. His other misdeeds are that he collects falsehoods and the causes which bring about disunity between the Arabs and their Allies and friends the High British Government, and this policy he learnt from those who brought him up, namely his predecessors the (Durks. I request you kindly to communicate this statement of mine to the Hon r ble Givil Commissioner at Baghdad and to deny all that the Sharif has said about me. The Sharif 1 s action is like unto a man who 'dives underneath water and swallows the camel'. the roads, thus causing evil movements as reported to you in my previous letter, and so making out Bin gaud to be a liar, and one that is collecting taxes and blocking the road# There is a clear proof, and you can form your conclusions from this my statement, and his statements* I hope, the High British Government will be on its guard against the reports of ill-disposed and interested people. I swear by Almighty Cod, that I am now hating the name of 'Arabs' which we and such people bear, as we have practically become the laughing stock of Governments on account of repeated Insha-Allah the High British Government is well aware of facts and of the Arabs generally, of whom sane do guard the prestige of twofold* never happen, and he will never gain such an object from the Arabs, He sends out his sons with horses and gets the people to block disentions and lies* thel» 3 l» : i&gt;. the Arabs, both by reason of their religion and because they are wise, though others who are called Arabs exist, but these are not of the genuine quality. I, your friend have rather lengthened this answer; but I could not help doing so, owing to my being desirous of describing the matter in detail. This is what had to be said and may you be preserved.

Prerious to this I sent you a letter which I hope, you hare reoeired, and that you are in perfect happiness. I haYe also to spy that for the satisfaction of my friends the High British Government and the tranquility of the Arabs, and our dislike for evil, I am bound to inform you of all that has happened. If it is found incorrect it is Just what we desire, and if anything has happened then there is no ground for complaint. I am enclosing herewith two letters: one being that of the Amir of Al-Xharmah, Xhalid, and the other of Ibn Qhannam, Amir of Tarabah for your perusal. Regarding the question of the Sharif and his sons, they would not go out to Taif except with the intention of a hostile movement, and Insha Allah if they make any evil movement it will turn against them, if such God pleases; Surely if any movement is made several similar movements will follow from the opposite aide. I am reporting this matter to you in order to oommunicate the same to the Hon'ble the Civil commissioner in Mesopotamia at Baghdad so that he may further convey it to H.B.M f s Government before anything happens. I send you these letters that you may gather information from them and as outside rumours regarding the evil Intentions and movements of the above mentioned are bound to be exaggerated; I do not like to report anything except what is reliable and trustworthy. I hope you will expedite despatch of this information; alee your friendly letters together with any fresh news you may have from my friends the High Government.

I am Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, The Under Secretary of State, India Office.i by (P 1314) From Secretami of Stale to Civil Commissioner, Baohdad, r ' ' 12th March 1919. I (Repeated Viceroy.) Your telegram of 2nd March transmitted in Cairo telegram No. 327. Bin Sand. Matter has received our further careful consideration in consultation with \\ ingate ( and Philby. Object of orders conveyed in ihy telegram of 26th February was to tide over immediate difficulty with a view to friendly arbitration between disputants at a more convenient season. But in deference to your view, which has strong support of Clayton and Wingate, that action proposed would not in fact achieve desired object. We are disposed to think that more definite announcement of our intention to support King Husain against Wahabi aggression may not safely be made. At same time we are reluctant to adopt so harsh a measure as immediate stoppage of whole subsidy f paid to Bin Sand, and we are anxious to convey our decision to latter in a form which will not render it impossible for him to acquiesce with good grace. You are accordingly authorised to send message to Bin Sand in following sense :— “ Circumstances in which his subsidy was originally granted no longer exist. Termination of hostilities has entirely altered situation, and His Majesty’s Government are now curtailing in every direction the heavy expenditure incurred during the war. r They have continued his subsidy at full rate for some months in order to facilitate demobilisation, but this having been accomplished ihey propose in any case to re d uce subsidy fm- thwith bv one half. They take the opportunity to express their concern at reports of impending hostilities between himself and King Husain to whom as he is aware they are bound by closest ties. They cannot but regard as ill-advised Bin Sand’s attempts to extend his influence and authority to so remote a spot as Khurma. The spread of militant Wahabism in this region would, in their opinion, constitute direct menace to Hejaz, security of which they are bound to safeguard against external aggression from any quarter. In these circumstances they advise him as a friend to modify his attitude and to dissuade his followers from further opposition to adminis trative measures taken by King Husain at Khurma. His Majesty’s Government feel sure that Bin Sand will take this friendly warning in good part, and will realise that the continuance of their support must be dependent on his readiness to fall in with their wishes and advice.” Foreign Office are repeating this telegram to High Gommissioner, Cairo, who will be instructed to inform King Husain of purport of message to Bin Sand.ij' i ^ » i£. !Ir. Garbett, I attach a note to me by Mr .Bedford, who has gone into this matter very carefully. I have not myself examined the papers further than to look at the file containing the telegram from Sir P.Cox of 26th November 1916, the letter from the Treasury of 1st January 1917, and the telegram to India of 4th January 1917. As regards the absence from this telegram of any reference to the stipulation by the Treasury that the subsidy should be granted for not more than six months in the first instance, Sir A. Hirtzel, who drafted the telegram, will n o doubt be able to explain. The Treasury letter of 1st January was not sent to us by the Foreign Office, it will be seen, till the 5th January, i.e. after our telegram was sent. This suggests that Sir Arthur relied on information given him unofficially by the Foreign Office, and his marginal note confirms this. The fact that on the following day Sir Arthur received from the Foreign Office the cop}/ - of the Treasury letter, and marked it 'Copy for India, Put by', and that the Foreign Office on their side made no comment on the copy of our telegram sent to them, seems to show that the Foreign Office and Treasury knew that we were not inserting the 6 months’ stipulation in our telegram and were agreeable. As Mr .Bedford points out, 'it seems desirable to ascertain from Baghdad or India the full amount of the payments made to Bin Saud. By the time that this information has been obtained Mr .Shuckburgh may have returned and will no doubt be able to throw further li$nt, if needed, on the subsequent transactions. Has the time come for stopping the subsidy? \ i^L—Financial Secretary, ' t i sJ C. V i 9 I 9 ' ^&gt;- 1 .; I append a list of 33 papers; corresponding numbers are affixed in the files* The Foreign Office draw attention to the fact that the subsidy of £5,000 per mensem, sanctioned by His Majesty's Treasury in favour of Emir Bin Saud for a period of six months from January 1917, has been paid ri^nt on to March 1918; they ask what explanation of this is to be given to the Lords Commissioners. The papers show that the subsidy was continued up to 12th March 1919, when it was reduced to £2,500 per mensem, with the concurrence of the Eastern Committee and the foreign Office. So far as shown by these files, it is still being paid to Bin Saud at this reduced rate (Papers 30, 31, 32 and 33). Further, there is some reason to think that for about two months it was paid at the rate of £10,000 per month. The Baghdad telegram^of 11th September 1918 and 15th November 1918 fix the probable limits for the duration of this increase, but the exact facts cannot be ascertained from the papers now available (Papers 23, 25, 26 and 29). In any case the total commitments up to date are probably nearly double the sum of £95,000 mentioned in the Foreign Office letter under consideration, and the bill is probably still mounting up. This, as regards the subsidy alone. An analysis oi the correspondence suggests that additional amounts ( on a comparatively small scale) may have oeen given, not to speak of presents in kind (rifles, provisions, etc.) Before the Foreign Office address His Majesty’s Treasury,r f) i° jt Treasury, it seems desirable that they should be in possession of full and exact figures under all heads. These are doubtless ascertainable from Baghdad or Delhi, b- For the failure to obtain renewed Treasury sanction, this Office must, I think, be held primarily responsible. The Government of India in their telegram of 7th December 1916 asked for sanction to grant Emir Bin Baud a subsidy of £5000 per mensem, without suggesting any particular period for its duration. Then comes the Treasury Order of 1st January 1917, granting the subsidy for six months; but this Office’s telegram of 4th January 1917 to the Government of India runs “Your proposal approved”, without mentioning the limitations to six months. It is clear from the sequel that the Government of India took this as an authority to continue payment until t receipt of orders to stop payment - which orders they have not yet received. 1. It is worth noting (1) that the actual Treasury sanction was communicated (by post) to the Government of India, though without special instructions (2) that a copy of this r Office telegram to the Government of India was communicated to the Foreign Office. Either thejflE communications were not noticed (being treated as mere routine) or their implications were overlooked. In any case, I hardly think that either circumstance is enough to clear this Office of primary responsibility. The Financial Department does not appear to have seen the telegram of 4th January 191J at the time of its despatch. (Papers (1) (2) (3) and (4)). ^ The financial aspect of His Majesty’s Government’s relations with Bin Baud came up again in January 1918, culminating in a telegram addressed by this Office to the Viceroy on 14th January 1910 to the effect that it will suffice for the present to dole out such small sums of money to Bin Baud as are thought desirable. Lord Hardinge has initialled * (on ••44 ■// / (on behalf of the Foreign Office), the margin of this telegram, which was also the result of a decision of the Eastern Committee. There woj 3 , however, nothing in this correspondence to recall the question of the subsidy to the attention of anybody concerned. , The Foreign Office on the one side probably supposed that the small doles (to which, by the way, no money limit was fixed by this Office; Mr.Philby had suggested £50,000 as a total limit) were &amp;Q that Bin Baud would receive: on the other hand, Simla and Baghdad clearly regarded the doles as an addition to the subsidy which they were continuing to pay. It may be observed that the Foreign Office do not appear to have considered specific sanction of the Treasury necessary for these doles. Perhaps, they considered the sanction of the Eastern Committee sufficient. That is, in any case, a matter for the Foreign Office (rather than this Office) to explain. The same comments are applicable to all subsequent stages of the transactions with Bin baud. (Papers (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10)). \V Financial questions arose again in March 1918. Sir P.Cox in his telegram of 9th March 1918 proposed “to regard as a gift the advance of two months 1 subsidy made (Bin Sand) by Mr.Philby”. Further, he recommended that, in tne event of Bin Saud having eventually to undertake a campaign against Bin Rashid of Hail, His Majesty’s Government should “double Bin Sand’s subsidy or give him a good lump sum”. These proposals, which were coupled with otxher non-financial proposals, were supported by the Viceroy and approved by this Office (telegram of 20th March 1918), and the Foreign Office (probably also by the Eastern Committee, though I do not find this expressly stated). u It is clear that the financial details were regarded x v as of small importance, compared with the militaxy and political considerations involved. This no doubt accounts for the factfact that neither this Office nor the Foreign Office noticed the implication* in Sir P.Oox's telegram that the subsidy was still being paid. In any case, it is fair to regard the Foreign Office as, from this point onwards, having had clear warning that the subsidy was being paid. (Papers (11) (12) (12A) (13) (14) (15)). ^ We come next to August 1918. The Baghdad authorities held at this stage that a campaign against Bin Rashid was becoming a political necessity. They therefore submitted a recommendation on 8th August 1918 11 to place liberal funds at Phil by ’ s disposal' for advances to Bin Baud at his discretion. These proposals were approved by this Office, (telegram of 15th August 1918) the Foreign Office and the Eastern Committee. No limit was placed to Lhe amount which might be dispersed. The Baghdad telegrams of 11th and 26th September 1918 show that Bin Baud’s subsidy was doubled about this time, apparently on the strength of this Office’s telegrams of 20th March and 15th August 1918. \S, In effect,* what was being financed was a wax between two Central Arabian chieftains, and it is difficult to see on what principle a limit could have been fixed to expenditure, the need for which would depend-on the chances of war. In any case, I may perhaps venture to repeat that this was for the Foreign Office to consider, so far as the question of Treasury sanction was concerned. (Papers (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (23) (25)). In September 1918, the policy of His Majesty’s Government changed to some extent. They were disposed to discourage the campaign against Bin Rashid (this Office telegram of 13th September 1918), but agreed provisionally to (Juyy\ SzkmA. khs having a subsidy of £10,000 a month; no actual period of duration was fixed (this Office telegram of 28th October 1918, read with Baghdad telegram 8789 of 16th October 1918). Lord Curzon (Eastern Committee) and Lord.Robert Cecil (Foreign** Office)Office) approved this Office telegram of 28th October 1918. (Papers (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28)). i1. A Baghdad telegram of 15th November 1918 shows that the subsidy had on some prior date reverted to the original figure of £5,000 per month. (Paper (29)). ^ In March 1919, Sir M.Cheetham proposed to stop the allowance altogether, but this Office with the concurrence of the Eastern Committee, Lord Curzon and the Foreign Office, decided to let it stand at the reduced figure! of £2,500 per rnensum. There is no further correspondence of financial significance. (Papers. (30) (31) (32) (33).). The net result of this analysis seems do be that:- (1) this Office is primarily responsible for the payment of * the allowance beyond the pehod of sanction, but (2) for the last 18 months, tne Foreign Office have been aware of the continued payment of the subsidy and have repeatedly recognized and acted on the fact of such continued payment. The Foreign Office are to this extent jointly responsible with this Office. (3) all (or practically all) proceedings since the beginning of 1918 have had the cognisance and approval of the Eastern Committee and (4) having regard to the extreme importance oi the poli tical and military questions and issues, involved ; it is not unnatural (though regrettable) that the financial aspect of the matter snould have been overlooked.1 43/f-) 1 Treasury Foreign Office 'Santion the grant to Ihn Saud,monthly subsidy of £5,000 as a temporary arrangement for not more than 6 months in the first instance* 2 5151 20*12.17*Cox India Office Suggests payment of £50,000 p.m. for 3 months* / 181 14.1.18* India Office India*and Cox.

Your telegram of 2nd March transmitted in Cairo telegram No. 827. Bin Sand. Matter has received our further careful consideration in consultation with W ingate and Philby. Object of orders conveyed in my telegram of 26th February was to tide over immediate difficulty with a view to friendly arbitration between disputants at a more convenient season. But in deference to your view, which has strong support of Clayton and Wingate, that action proposed would not in fact achieve desired object. We are disposed to think that more definite announcement of our intention to support King Husain against Wahabi aggression may not safely be made. At same time we are reluctant to adopt so harsh a measure as immediate stoppage of whole subsidy paid to Bin Saud, and we are anxious to convey our decision to latter in a form which will not render it impossible for him to acquiesce with good grace. Yon are accordingly authorised to send message to Bin Saud in following sense : “ Circumstances in which his subsidy was originally granted no longer exist. Termination of hostilities has entirely altered situation, and His Majesty’s Government are now curtailing in every direction the heavy expenditure incurred during the war. They have continued his subsidy at full rate tor some months in order to facilitate demobilisation, but this having been accomplished they propose in any case to reduce subsidy forthwith by one half. They take the opportunity to express their concern at reports of impending hostilities between himself and King Husain to whom as he is aware they are bound by closest ties. They cannot but regard as ill-advised Bin Sand’s attempts to extend his influence and authority to so remote a spot as Khurma. The spread of militant Wahabism in this region would, in their opinion, constitute direct menace to llejaz, security of which they are bound to safeguard against external aggression from any quarter. In these circumstances they advise him as a friend to modify his attitude and to dissuade his followers from further opposition to adminis trative measures taken by King Husain at Khurma. His Majesty s Government feel sure that Bin Saud will take this friendly warning in good part, and will realise that the continuance of their support must be dependent on his readiness to fall in with their wishes and advice.” Foreign Office are repeating this telegram to High ( ommissioner, Cano, who will be instructed to inform King Husain of purport ol message to Bin Saud.

(Repeated to Foreign and Cairo.) (Received 17th, 11 a.m.) 8789. Bin baud. We have come to parting of the ways and 1 think it is urgent that Bin Sand should be made clearly to understand he must come into line and comply with orders of His Majesty’s Government or take the consequences. Events of last four years have given him, like other Arabian Chiefs, an exaggerated sense of his own importance, and the present moment seems as favourable as any is likely to occur to bring him to his bearings. I recom mend Phil by Avhose position is now scarcely tenable should come to Baghdad forthwith for consultation and that Lieutenant-Colonel Leachmari. who is available immediately should be deputed'in his place with the temporary rank of Brigadier-General to proceed without delay to Bin Sand to explain to him that (1) His Majesty’s Government are unable to give him more arms at present; (2) In view of fall of Damascus His Majesty’s Government see no reason to modify their orders already communicated to him that further hostilities against Bin Rashid are not called for; (3) Nevertheless they are prepared to continue present subsidy of 10,000L per mensem till the end of the war, but on specific understanding that Bin baud complies with orders of His Majesty’s Government ; (4) Failure to do so will involve prompt stoppage of his subsidy and will compel His Majesty’s Government to reconsider their policy towards him. I believe message on the above lines delivered by Leachman whose virile handling of Arab tribes has been of such value to this Force will probably bring Bin baud to his bearings and save much trouble in future. At the same time I would ask His Majesty’s Government to consider possibility of making a declaration on the lines of paragraph 1, my telegram of 7th August, 6491. .3413—1 From Political, Baghdad, Ihth November 1918.

Leachman now fully occupied on important work in Mosul Vilayat, whence I cannot with draw him without detriment to important interests. In any case, in altered circumstances I do not think despatch of any officer to Bin baud necessary at present. Bin Rashid has apparently made peace with both parties and situation may be allowed to develop naturally. Meanwhile Bin baud will continue to receive his regular subsidy of 5,000h I am informing him of the final defeat of our common enemies an-d-mxpressing pious hope that Arabian problem will reach mutually satisfactory solution. 1 am also sending him copy of Anglo-French declaration of 8th November. He cannot fail to interpret latter as reaffirmation of resolution of Allies to allow' Arab communities, including Nejd element, to determine their own destinies. In these circumstances, while fully aware of iar greater difficulties confronting His Majesty’s Government in Hejaz and Palestine and byria compared with our local problems, in the Persian Gulf, Nejd, Mesopotamia and Kurdistan, I am of opinion persistence of bherif in the matter of Khurma may not only precipitate actual hostilities, but shake Bin baud’s faith in the honesty of British intentions. Matter therefore calls for careful consideration in relation to our general Arab policy. Philby has written a full report on Nejd Mission’s work of past year. 1 would propose to depute him to visit Cairo to discuss matter with High Commissioner on my behalf, after which he will proceed home on leave. He 30 C will have copies of report with him for you and Cairo and copies will posted to Delhi. Philby will leave almost immediately. be[P 3931] From Political Officer, Baghdad, 7th September 1918. (Repeated, to India, and Cairo.) (Received 8th, 10 p.m.) 7419. 7th. My immediately preceding telegram. Philbv (R.) writes :— “ Regarding suggestion to divert Ibn Sand’s attention have had that purpose in mind for long time and have come to following conclusions :— “ (1) That Khurma affair has gone too far and created too much feeling amongst people of Nejd to allow of any satisfactory solution other than imposition of mutual hands-off policy on both sides for the period of the war. Am perfectly convinced that even if Ibn Sand can be persuaded to hold aloof renewed attacks on Khnrma will, result in widespread conflagration, which once started will be impossible to control. Turks in Asir and Medina and Ibn Rashid can scarcely fail to profit by such situation. “(2) Assuming above settlement Khurma trouble it is always possible that some petty event or another of Badawin life will raise Ataiba problem or that of boundary generally, and am convinced desirable to divert Ibn Sand’s attention from such matters. Nevertheless, am convinced that mere gift of money or profitable land will not serve purpose, as such gifts would still leave him idle. In any case doubt if he would accept gift of land in Mesopotamia and terms doubt wisdom of introducing Wahhabi element into countrv. “(3) In my opinion real activity is only panacea for ills arriving (sic ? arising) from natural indolence of life of Arabs and this conclusion I have kept steadily in view in connection with proposed operations against Hail. With limited resources at my disposal I have not been able to do very much but have felt natural reluctance to abandon Hail offensive. Nevertheless, had it not been for such dispositions as I have been able to make no changes would have been ready for diversion of warlike feeling consequent upon first attack on Khurma. As it is, forth coming offensive has been a Godsend, as mobilisation at worst enables Ibn Sand to collect his forces and keep them content by regular feeding and indirect control. Unfortunately the money laid out .in this venture will not last for ever, and at present cannot say how long mobilisation will hold good. I am [three groups undecipherable] have nothing to fall back on, but am emboldened by His Majesty’s Government’s present views to reopen subject. “Feel perfect confidence can keep large force actively employed in operations against Hail and neighbourhood if Government can place more arms and money at my disposal and my proposals as follows : — “ First, as regards artillery, am of opinion that owing to loss of time lor training no guns can be used. “ Secondly, as regards small arms, would request that 5,000 rifles of good type with corresponding ammunition be sent to Koweit to be doled out by Political Agent on my requisition. Essential that Ibn Sand and his Koweit agent should know nothing of this. I would propose to let him have 1,000 at once, and to dole out rest in event of Sherifian crisis practically as bribes for inaction that direction. “ Thirdly, money is all important, as Ibn Sand cannot keep his forces in the field without feeding them. Would suggest, therefore, i be given monthly allotment of 10,0007,. or that I be allowed to draw at discretion on Koweit up to total maximum of 50,0007. up to end of December. Essential allotment be to me and not to Ibn Saud, as can then count on getting good value. “Finally, trust above proposals will receive favourable consideration. In anticipation of acceptance in principle am asking Political Agent. Koweit, to supply 3,000 bags of rice, 200 coffee, 200 sugar, to Ibn gaud’s agent, from stores by him, and debit it to Mission. Have told Ibn Saud to send for above on understanding that he will have to pa}' for them in due course. Kindly sanction issue. Trust may receive early reply to this. Am handing over 3,000 bags rice, 200 coffee, to Abdullah Naiisi, no sugar available. Am charging cost price plus 10 per cent, to cover godown rent commission.” My comment follows. ■1 1Minute Pa ft From Sir P. Cox, 9th March 1918.

Ibn Sand, dffiilby lias reached Bombay and will return at once via koweit to Ibn Sand with our reply., i had hoped to ( ? ) with him here but he was unable to get passage in time. After communication however, lam now making following final proposals for general approval’ I hdby will explain to Ibn Sami that we have been unable to lind any suitable artillery personnel for his guns among our prisoners of war and we do not think that British personnel serve the purpose so he must try and make use of his own as heretofore and we shall be glad to train another party if necessary. As regards the guns, reports of our officers show that transport across Arabia through desert sand of field guns in excess of use by us would not be a ( ? ) proposition, and as regards^ the small mountain guns he appears to have sufficient for all necessary purposes, in the above circumstances we recognise he may not find it impossible (sic) to undertake operations on such a large scale as ty enable him to capture Hail and our operations are proceeding so well Syria that we feel that there is no necessity to press him unduly in.this connection, but at any rate it is still most important that he should maintain more effective control in Quasim and stop smuggling and put real pressure on Shammar. To this end we are prepared to assist him with 1,000 more rifles. 100,000 rounds which Mr. Philby will place at his disposal as necessity arises. He may also regard as a gift the advance of two months’subsidy made him by Mr. Philby. As regards Hail, I do not consider Ibn Sand is really keen on taking it except in circumstances which make it apparent that he is doing so at our bidding and under our direction. At the same time, should good oppor tunity arise for his doing so, either by diplomacy or force, with above meagre assistance, I understand there would be no objection to it in principle either on the part of His-Majesty’s Government or High Commissioner. If it should come to pass, I think we should be prepared to double Ibn Sand’s subsidy or give him good lump sum. I trust general approval will be telegraphed to our proceeding on above lines, and that General Officer Com manding may be authorised to supply rifles. Baghdad will repeat your reply to me.

(Received 15th January, 11 a.ra.) [P.] 385. On return from short absence 1 find several telegrams from Philby, certain of which I think I should repeat:— “No. M. 20 of 8th January. General attitude of this side seems against encouraging or helping Bin Sand to attack flail; first, because Hamilton’s report, reinforced by strong and obviously prejudiced representations by King’s sons, have caused keen alarm aDout possibility of Wahhabi militant ^ revival, vide Arab Bulletin No. 74 ; secondly, because it is feared that Bin Sand’s secret purpose is to attack King, and that he might do that successfully, bringing to nothing all that has been done to secure British influence in Islamic world through our influence with King ; and thirdly, because to some extent it is regarded as desirable not to eliminate Bin Rashid, who might serve as useful counterpoise in future rivalry of King and Bin Sand, though this point is not seriously pressed. _ It is fully realised that only possible military objective of Bin Saud is Hail, and that he cannot undertake it without assistance proposed, while it _ is also realised that main object of Najd mission was to study situation with that end in view, but it is argued that recent successes Palestine and weakening of Wady Haifa position in 1 ledjaz necessitate reconsideration of our plans regarding Hail. “ While fully realising Najd operations must be subordinated to general scheme, both military and political, I must point out that intimation of abortion of mission will be extensively prejudicial to our interests and prestige in Najd, and will put an end to intimate relations established by Shakespear in spite of Wahhabi prejudice in [.f], especially as such decision will be taken as based primarily on our engagements with King of Hecljaz, between whom and Bin Sand it is idle to pretend that there is slightest vestige of real cordiality. “ We cannot compel them to be friends, but we can very effectively compel them to respect each others territorial integrity by withdrawing subsidies or threatening sea-ports, and in case of Bin Sand, the valuable Province of Hasa. Best means of securing reasonable modus vnemU between them is, in my opinion, to recognise Bin Sand s natural claims to Hail and if he succeeds in capturing it, his rule m whole of Central Arabia east of line to be fixed between it and Hedjaz. To encourage King to hope for suzerainty over Bin Saud or to attempt to persuade latter m any way to accept such position will only embitter relations further. “ At the same time I deprecate attaching too much importance to Wahhabi possibilities. The Akhwan should be regarded as constituting standing army Bin Saud is perfectly justified in maintaining, just as King does and will maintain regular force. Total number of Akhwan at present does not in my opinion exceed 10,000 or 12,000 men in all, and Bin mnn could raise twice or thrice this number if able to arm and pay them ^ “ Finally capture of Hail would be serious blow to lurkish piestige, and might hasten conclusion of hostilities in Hedjaz. I submit, therefore m would be great pity to forego chance either because it does not suit King. book or because it raises fears of possible \\ ahhabi ambitions 1118 ’ therefore that question will be considered as at time of Missions depaitme from sole standpoint of our general military requirements, l urks are by no means done with yet, however excellent our present prospects are, and any blow likely to increase their troubles should not be lightly foregone. “ In any case time presses if operations are to be undertaken this season. 1 Trust decision will be arrived at early. . “ Have given Hogarth copy of above for information.Minute Paper.

J Hitherto Ibn baud has done no more than keep his son Turki controlling tubal situation in Qasim and acting as watching outpost, mainly on defensive, but attacking or seducing i bn Rashid’s tribes as opportunity offered. Ibn baud asks us to recognise, however, that by so doing he has at least rendered it impossible for Ibn Rashid to divert strength towards Mesopotamia. As regards armament, Ibn baud estimates that Ibn Rashid has 20,000 good modern rifles and at least five mountain guns, and can muster 15,000 tribesmen ; whereas he himself has seven serviceable mountain guns, four machine guns, and about 8,000 rifles, of which probably 3,000 are needei for garrisons of Hasa and other Provinces. Phi I by considers this estimate of Ibn Rashid’s resources is doubtless overdrawn, but that it is certain that Ibn Rashid is stronger in regard to both number and quality of rifles, and he'considers that force of 15,000 men is minimum required to tackle him effectively. Ibn Sand states that given adequate assistance in money and ytrins, he could mobilise that number, and whereas immediate future s most ‘favourable time lor action, lie could if necessary keep them mobilised until next June, when they would disperse on commencement of Ramazan, lie would prefer not to mobilise in Qasim, but probably in Sidair, and watch for favourable opportunity to deliver sudden blow, lie confesses that Hail is difficult nut to crack owing to unity between townsmen and Beduin, but considers that once in Hail he could act effectively further afield with co-operation of his Anaizah connections. He gauges his requirements for success as follows, namely, 2 siege and 2 held guns with necessary ammunition; 10,000 rifles with ammunition; and 50,000b per month for period of operation ; in addition he requires rtain personnel, preferably Arab prisoners of war who served in luikish „rtillery. If British Artillery officer is deputed he must know Arabic well and be prepared to live the life of Arabs. Cunliffe Owen’s estimate (which is being telegraphed separately) is not very different to above, and they agree that if it is mainly complied vith project is worth undertaking, and has good prospects of success. It is for limber authority to decide whether game is worth the candle, and he hopes that decision will be favourable. ? proposes that guns be sent as asked for by Cunliffe Owen, together with 7,000 or 8,000 rifles, and that Ibn Sand be granted an initial sum of 20,000b for purchase of camels, Ac., and a monthly grant of 50,000b for three months, on condition of his mam- tainiim 15,000 men under arms in field, and promise of a present of pO,UUOt. on capture of Hail, and continuance of monthly allowance if his services are required further.

(Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Secretary of State for India Army Commander.) Ibn Saud asks me to lay following before Government :— In his light with Ibn Rashid, in which Captain Shakespear was killed, he lost enormously in rides and material looted than after the collision. Before he could recover from this, Turks and Ibn Rashid set Ajman against him, and he had difficult time with them. Since then protraction of war has made his position with his tribesmen still more difficult. I heir main normal source of income is the camel trade with Syria, and they resent stoppage of this, and wish they were not in the opposite camp to the Turks. They are still loyal to himself, but being weak from a military point of view, he has had trouble of doing much more than usual in order to keep them so. P He was veiy grateful for the 20,000/. given him last year, and ^or 1,000 rifles, but former was mostly spent forthwith in liquidating debts, while he utilised latter to arm his permanent guards for protection of his towns Conditions being as above, he has not been in a position to give much military co-operation without being financed and assisted with arms. Short of this,' however, he submits that he has done all that he can in the way of moral co-operation. Thus he has arrested Bin Faraoon, and handed his camels over to us ; he has identified himself most publicly with us by his visit to Koweit and Busrah, and pronouncement he made there . On conclusion of his visit here, he will return at once to Riadh, and is prepared instantaneously to proceed to Qasim, where, if assisted, he will maintain 4,000 men underarms to be employed under himself and his brother and son. If Ibn Rashid moves towards Irak in force he will move up parallel with him towards Zobeyr, and join up with our friendly tribes and with a force from Koweit. During visit here he will warn Sheikhs of our combine, who are here to meet him, that if Ibn Rashid threatens them in strength he will move up m then support. , . r\ • i If Ibn Rashid remains in Hail, Ibn Saud will remain at Qasim, and hnraqs or attack him as opportunity offers. . In the direction of munitions, he asks for 3,000 rifles and some machine guns with necessary ammunition. In the matter of money, ie s a es la hffih nrices now prevailing, and the cost of transport, they will cost Rs 1 Jifdfyper ml/to mamtm in the field, and leaves it tons to gl ve hnn such montillv subsidy as we feel able. ,i i 1 suo-o-est that we should give him until further notice a monthly assurance of 5.0001., together with 3,000 rifles and ammunition an. our machine guns Though military result of Ins co-operation may not amount m much the value of his moral co-operation is very considerable and I _ j t -i- Vi -i t r'h ould hr given by us to Shereef and by lurks to Ibn Ae measure support above proposed appears moderate, and 1 trust will be accepted.[P 4462] [P 4593] (Addressed b oreign, Simla, repeated to Secretary of State for India.) i °c ^ er f nce to Foreign No. 92720 S. I have jest received further letter from Bm Sand dated 3rd September. He makes no allusion to receipt of any fiesh communication from Sherif, but apparently means his present lettei to be the further reference ” which he promised as reported in my telegram No. 4523 of 7th September. As regards question of attacking Bin Rashid in or near Hail he first alludes to need for guns before mentioned, but then goes on to say only present obstacle is that political juncture appears to him unfavourable. He then observes that if questions of attacking Bin Rashid or assisting Sherif are merely matters of Arab policy concerning chiefs inter se, then it is a question of watching for such a suitable opportunity as will ensure successful result, and this they may be counted upon to do. If or? the other hand either project affects our interests as well as his own, he says that he will no doubt conform to our views and wishes after discussion with me, preferably at personal-meeting. With Army Commander’s permission I could probably arrange to bring off a meeting with him towards latter part of this month, but if it is not desired to press upon him any specific form of action it would perhaps be better not to have meeting just now, but simply inform him that His Majesty’s Government hope he will do his utmost to support Sherif in whatever way he considers fit and feasible. Please let me know wishes of Government on this point. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 27th October 1916. (Repeated to Sir P. Cox.) Secret. Bin Sand. Your telegram of 30th September. Have you any further observations on Cox’s telegram of 6th October regarding Bin Sand’s letter of 3rd September ? If Section 15 of Bin Sand’s letter of 20th July indicates disposition to pla} T off Egyptian against Indian authorities, Cox should discourage any such attempt, and allay suspicions that British Government would sacrifice his interests or that Sherif is not acting in good faith, in proof of which his deposition by the Turks could be cited. Though Bin Sand’s military value against the Turk is small, he can indirectly assist by holding Bin Rashid in check and preventing him from attacking Sherif or Basra. This need nor involve capture of Hail. A limited offensive of this kind is not inconsistent with view expressed in your telegram of 30th and might be encouraged in his own interest. If some assistance in way of munitions is really needed, Cox might report actual requirements. From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 31 st October 1916. Secret. Your telegram of the 2/th October. Bin Sand. Following telegram from Sir P. Cox, 5558, 29th October :~~ (R.) “ Following from Political Agent, Bahrein “M received to-day open letter from Bin Sand to your address which he asked me to read and telegraph on. Gist as follows (First.) Turkish Government has sent 25 German and Turkish Officers, .&gt;00 soldiers with guns and supplies, and Rasheed Bin Lyla, Constantinople agent, Ibn Rashid, to Ibn Rashid. Rasheed with one lurkish and two Geiman officeis, have left Hail in direction of Iraq. . “ ‘(Second.) Turks in Medina have abandoned idea of moving on Mecca, and troops detailed for this expedition have returnedAo Syria. _ “ ‘(’Third.) Bin Sand is very anxious to have an interview with you, and says he will be in [? Hasa on] 7th November. . i &lt; ir \ . “I am just leaving in ‘Lawrence for Bahrein and ha tar. 11 Army Commander lias no objection perhaps I had better see Bin Sand. After having expressed urgent desire for interview, he would misinterpret my having been so near at hand and not complying with Ins request. He could probably meet me about I-th Lovembe i. We will report on point raised in your telegram after Cox s meeting with Bin Sand, which should clear air.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000212_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/635</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000212</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/635</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 4931/1916 'Arabia [Nejd]: Bin Saud's subsidy.
