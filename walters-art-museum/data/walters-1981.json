Comparisons with other representations of Harpokrates suggest that he held a cornucopia in his proper left arm and put his right index finger to his mouth, as a gesture representative of children. He wears the combined crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. His wavy hair is bound into a top knot above his forehead and is partially braided in the back. The eyes would have held inlays.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1914", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/27776", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris, [date and mode of acquisition unknown; said to be from the Delta of Egypt]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1914, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-05-14T01:00:02.653", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.606_Fnt_DD_AT18-034442-tms.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.606_Fnt_DD_AT18-034442-tms.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.606_Fnt_DD_AT18-034442-tms.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.606_Fnt_DD_AT18-034442-tms.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.606_Fnt_DD_AT18-034442-tms.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL2_54.606_Fnt_BW_H48.jpg, PS1_54.606_Back_DD_AT18-034443-tms.jpg, PS1_54.606_Bot_DD_AT18-034451-tms.jpg, PS1_54.606_Fnt_DD_AT18-034442-tms.jpg, PS1_54.606_Lft_DD_AT18-034454-tms.jpg, PS1_54.606_Rt_DD_AT18-034453-tms.jpg, PS1_54.606_Top_DD_AT18-034452-tms", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
