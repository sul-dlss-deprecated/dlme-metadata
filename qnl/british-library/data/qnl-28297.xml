In tho case of incomes exceedinp 1C,C0C iials the amount to be paid will be three times tlie largest amount paid in any o^ the years 1942,43 and 44. A favourite device for evading income tax under the old law was to dispose of profits by the Issue to shareholders of bonus shares. This device, whilst it evaded the payment of profits tax, gave rise to an enormous inflation of the capital of the companies concerned. One cotton mill in Isfahan increased its capital by this method from under half a million rials before the war to 19-j) million rials at the present time. The new law provides that only 18;S of the capital held on the 20th Larch,1943, shall be exempt from profits tax, and only 6;a of the exemption wf11 cover any additional shares accruing to the companies since that date.

Note 5 . after the approval of this Law the Finance Tribunal shall no longer deal with any difference arising between the Ministry of Finance and the tax-payer in connection with the assessment and determination of the amount of income tax payable for 1323 and 1324, except in the case mentioned in Note 1 of this Law. Differences on which a final decision has not been issued by the date of the approval of this Law shall be covered by this Note. Note 6 .

Tiie proposed amendments are as follows (i). ’’The following note should be added to sub-para. (a) of Article III ’’Note: Dividends and the total net profit of internal companies whose main centres $re in Persia shall not be liable to taxation.” This amendment refers to the definition of ’’net income'. It would appear that ti^ere is an error in this amendment for as it stands at present it does not make sense. It may be that the word 'not” - should nave been inserted before the words 'in Persia'. The note would then refer to foreign companies with office? in Persia. (ii). 'The following amendments shall be made in sub- para;(v) of Article VI (a) . After the words ’’newly developed lands” the words ’’the newly constructed qanats' shall be added. (b) . The period mentioned in the latter part of- the para, shall be altered from 'two” to 'four' years.” By this amendment income from newly constructed qanats as well as newly developed lands is exempted from taxation, and further the period covering the term'newly' Is extended from two to four years. (iii). 'Article VII shall be amended to read as follows 'In order to assess special incomes ready made articlesand goods in stock shall be entered in the accounts at the end of the year.' This Article at present specifies that.the value of stocks of goods shall be included in the assessment and that if no stock records are kept the value of such stocks shall be computed by the Taxation Authorities. The proposed amendment in effect orders that records must be kept. / (iv). His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, • Foreign Office. POL. tit+T.■ 3^; - 2 - r I** (iv).

This amendment proposes to reduce the number nf* fixation rroups from 19 to 9 cnus simplifying procedure. It also reduces the percentage of taxation to which incomes are liable. fvi) M The phrase n Tax on landed property T snaj-l be ’ deleted from Article XIII, and the purase 'collected by the Municipality ox each district” shall be added to para.(b) o^ Articl XIII. n Article XIII makes provision for Municipal revenue Som National sources. The Municipal weighing tax and land tax were, with the^ introduction of the present law, replaced by.- (a) . A levy at the rate oi 10 # on the total income tax payable to the Central Government. (b) . Electricity Taxes. (c) . A levy at the rate of £# on the total income tax paid to the Central Government by merchants.-o- I The purpose of (c) was to provide revenue to defray the expenses of the local Chambers of Commerce. These three sources of revenue are at present being collected by the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Municipalities. If the proposed amendment is passed it would appear that the land tax will be reinstated and tlie collection of electricity taxes will revert to the Municipalities. (vii) • ’’Paragraph (a) of Article XVI shall be amended to read as follows:- ’’The Cabinet may, at the beginning of each fiscal year, fix certain fines to be paid by those violating the Income Tax Regulations, the Stamp Fees Lav/, and regulations approved by the Majlis Financial Lav/s Commission, the maximum fine being equal to 100^ of the tax or stamp fee which has not been paid. ” ’’The following clause shall be added to para.(c) of Article XVI:- ’’The same fine shall, after the attempt to avoid payment of taxes has been proved by the Assessment Committee or by the Financial Court, be applicable to those who, hoping to deprive the Government of income, do not enter all transactions in their books or who falsify the entries of any transactions. The payment of such fines shall not exempt the person liable to payment of the original tax from prosecution by the Penal Court for perjury, forgery, etc. ” By this proposal the penalty for non submission of returns will be amended. The penalty will increase from the present maximum of 5$ of the total amount due to a maximum of 100^. It is at present cheaper to pay the penalties than to pay the taxes, and an attempt lias evidently been made to put an end to this anomaly. Further, by this proposed amendment to Article XVI, the penalty for false declaration is extended to cover the inadequate keeping of accounts and stock records, though it is not clear whether there is to be imposed an additional Tine for such failure. In addition to cliarges of making false declarations for purpose of defrauding the Government of revenue, persons will be liable to face charges of perjury, forgery, etc. (viii) (5&gt;-4 (viii). ’’The following note should be added to Article XVII:- ”Note: In order to secure taxes payable by taxpayers who have no definite property or fixed residence in Persia, or should fixed property prove insufficient to meet the payment of the t he Government shall be authorised to demand the production of solvent sureties and shall be empowered to take any other action deemed necessary to circumvent attempts to avoid payment of the required tax.” /y r \ (ix). This note makes clear the procedure for the collect.!on of income tax from debtors owning no property upon which distraint can be levied; such persons shall be obliged to deposit suitable guarantees with the A uthorities. ’’Article XiX should be amended to read as follows ”To determine and examine complaints by taxpayers in connection ’with assessments made by local Finance Departments, and to eliminate differences'between taxpayers and Finance Departments arising from the enforce ment of the Income Tax Law, committees known as Committees of Assessment shall be established in each financial area. The manner in which the Assessment Committees shall be formed, membership of the Committees, their competence and the methods of examination shall be determined by regulations drawn up by the Majlis Financial Laws Commission. The decision of the Assessment Committee shall in all respects be final and binding except when the discrepancy exceeds Rials 10,000, in which case an appeal may be lodged in the Financial Court within one month from the date of the notification of the Committee’s decision. Should the taxpayer appeal and request reconsideration of his case he shall deposit in cash a sum equivalent to the disputed amount, or shall produce a bank or property guarantee. In issuing a decision In connection with tax payers who are small business men or artisans and who are not forced by lav/ to keep books, the Committee shall be empowered, after consideration of their financial records and the circumstances of the case, to reach agree ment with the taxpayer on the amount of tax to bo paid. This procedure shall also be applicable to all those who have not settled their income tax accounts for the year 1323 or previous years. ” This amendment revises the clause setting out the procedure for appeal against assessments. It provides for the establishment of new Committees of unspecified composition which shall replace the present Commissions now composed of a nominee of the Finance Department, a Judge andone other per sen, the last to be a nominee of the Municipal Council i the local Chamber or Corrjiicrcc, local Medical Council, the local Agricultural Council, or the group to which the appellate belongs. The remainder or the new amendment provides that the sum in dispute shall bo deposited in cash pending aettlcrneht, and at the same time provides ror the possibility or a cornpromi se so111 ement • (x). 'The regulations connected with the law approved on the 29th or Aban 1322 (19th November 1943), with due observation of the amendments mentioned in tMs law, shall be eniorced in accordance with the proposal or the Ministry or Finance and the approval of the Majlis Financial Laws Commission.” Those proposals have not yet been debated in the T’ajlis and it is probable that they themselves will be subject to Further amendment aFtor discussion.

THE attached memorandum, marked (A), indicates the position in the United Kingdom as regards immunity from legal process of the members and staff of a diplomatic mission. The only British statute in force which purports in any way to define the position of privileged persons in this country as regards legal process is the Diplomatic Privileges Act, 1708 (7 Anne Cap. 12), a copy of which, as amended by the Statute Law Revision Act, 1867, is annexed (B). This statute, however, is mainly declaratory in its nature and is not a complete codification of the law. It refers only to civil process. The privileges of Ambassadors, Ministers and other persons regarded as entitled to diplomatic immunities in England rest on the unwritten common law as much as on this statute. The common law contains a principle that what is shown to be international law is prima facie also part of the common law. (b) Consular. Foreign consular officers do not enjoy any personal immunity from arrest or process nor from the obligation of appearing in court to give evidence on such questions as may properly be put to them in the interests of justice. In all cases in which the attendance in court of foreign consular officers is desired, it is the practice to show them every consideration not inconsistent with the due course of justice with the object of avoiding unnecessary interference with their official duties, e.g., by making such arrangements as are possible with regard to the fixing of dates and times. His Majesty’s Government recognise that there is a principle of international law that legal proceedings should not be entertained against a foreign consular officer in respect of acts done by him in the course of his official duties and within the scope of consular duties as ordinarily recognised by international practice. The exact scope and effect of this principle under international law is, however, rather uncertain, and no case has come before the courts of this country where this issue has been raised, and, in view of these facts, there is some uncertainty with regard to the matter in municipal practice. It is thought that effect w r ould be given to this principle by the courts of this country in any case where it could be shown properly to apply under the doctrine referred to at the end of (a) above. It is clear that a foreign consul could not be sued or prosecuted in this country for failing to perform a consular duty, since the law of this country imposes no obligation on him to do so. 2. Inviolability. (a) Diplomatic. The inviolability of the premises of the diplomatic mission is fully recognised, and so also is the inviolability of its archives and its correspondence sent by the channels recognised by international law or accepted by His Majesty’s Government. It is difficult clearly to distinguish personal inviolability from immunity from arrest and process, which has been dealt with above, but the persons of the Head of the Mission and his diplomatic staff and their families are recognised as possessing a special status entitling them to a special degree of respect and protection. Exemption from compliance with the provisions of the Aliens Order of 1920 or other legislation with regard to registration of foreigners with the police authorities is enjoyed by the personnel of a diplomatic mission enjoying immunity from legal process, as set out in Annex (A) to this memorandum. (b) Consular. The inviolability of consular archives and of official consular correspondence between the consul and his Government or the diplomatic mission of his own country sent by the recognised channels is recognised. A consul could not be compelled to produce, or give evidence in court with regard to, any matter 9896 [19813] ' B(e) Miscellaneous. Members of the Diplomatic Body are exempted as an act of courtesy from the payment of duty on the undermentioned local taxation licences :— To keep carriages. To use armorial bearings. To keep dogs. To carry a gun. To kill game, and To employ a game-keeper to kill game. No title to exemption from these taxes is recognised in the case of foreign consular officers. (A) Memorandum respecting Position of Members of Foreign Diplomatic Missions in London as regards Legal Proceedings in the United Kingdom. IT is the practice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to include in the official list of persons whom they regard as entitled to claim diplomatic immunity the names of— (а) Members of the diplomatic staffs of Heads of Mission {e.g., counsellors, secretaries (fee.). (б) Any other officials employed directly under the orders of a Head of Mission in his diplomatic capacity. . (c) Servants, of whatever nationality, employed by a Head of Mission, but not servants employed by a member of his staff. In pursuance of the provisions of the Act 7 Ann., cap. 12, 1708, under which the list of privileged persons is maintained, copies of this list are communicated to the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex in oi der that they may be available to all persons who may wish to consult them before commencing any legal proceedings. Copies are also furnished to the Metropolitan Police authorities for their general information and guidance. Under the law of this country no person named in the list may be sued in the civil courts, whatever his nationality, unless the Head of the Mission in which he is serving consents to waive his immunity so as to render such proceedings possible. As a matter of policy, His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to accept for inclusion in the list the names of any persons employed in an official capacity, whether diplomatic or clerical, &amp;c., if they are British subjects. In the case of persons employed in a domestic capacity, however, His Majesty's Government, as already indicated, do not discriminate between those who are British subjects and those who are not. As regards proceedings in penal matters the question is governed not by statutory law or regulation, but by customary law. It seems clear, however, that Heads of Mission and the members of their diplomatic staffs, who have been accepted and placed on the list, must be regarded as immune from criminal prosecution, and that as a matter of practice other members of their official and domestic staffs whose names appear in the above-mentioned list are not prosecuted except after consultation with the Head of the Mission. As a rule, however, such cases are of minor importance and the matter is adjusted without recourse to legal proceedings. There are no regulations as regards the channel to be used for the service of process, whether civil or criminal, on persons named in the official list. It would, however, be manifestly irregular if any attempt were made to effect service on Embassy or Legation premises. Civil process is served by agents of the private parties to the proceedings, and if persons entitled to claim diplomatic immunity were served with civil writs outside such premises, and the Head of the Mission concerned were not prepared to waive his privilege so as to enable the action to proceed, the court would set aside the process on application being made by the Crown or by the diplomatic person concerned. [19813] b 2v o #r 7 all sheriffs, bailiffs and other officers and ministers of justice concerned in the execution of process are hereby required to have regard to this Act as they will answer the contrary at their peril. (C) Memorandum on the Treatment for Purposes of the United Kingdom Income-Tax of (a) Foreign Ambassadors and Ministers in the United Kingdom and Members of their Staffs, and (b) of Non-Diplomatic Representatives of Foreign Governments in the United Kingdom. (a) Diplomatic Missions. (1) The governing principle recognised in the administration of the Income- Tax Acts of the United Kingdom is that the Heads of Foreign Diplomatic Missions in the United Kingdom, and all persons, of whatever rank, on their stalls {except British subjects on their official staffs), are entitled to diplomatic ^ The immunities from income-tax, except for a special relief in favour of Tie Heads of Missions alone (vide paragraph (6)), rest not on income-tax law, but on considerations of international law. . , A clerk or typist on the official staff at an Embassy or Legation, unless he^is a British subject, is treated as entitled, so far as income-tax is concerned, to tne same immunities as, e.g., a counsellor, secretary or attache • i j Any member of the domestic staff, e.g., a cook or a butler, is treated as entitled to the same immunities, even if he is a British subject. m.B.—The foregoing statement is subject to possible exception in the case of any individual on the staff of a Mission personally engaged in trade or business. Consequently the following paragraphs cannot be taken as applying to sucn individuals.) (2) Income from Diplomatic emoluments, or salary or wages paid to any member of the official or domestic staff (except a British subject on the official staff) for his duties in connexion with the Mission, are treated as exempt from United Kingdom income-tax. . . No title to exemption is recognised in respect of any other earnings in mis country, c.g., fees from the directorship of a British company. , (3) Income from Investments, &amp;c. —Income derived by any member ot the official or domestic staff (except a British subject on the official staff) from sources outside the United Kindom, whether retained abroad or remitted to the United Kingdom, is treated as exempt from United Kingdom income-tax, and repayment is made in respect of any tax deducted before receipt of the income, the exemption extends to income from foreign or colonial investments, even when payable in the United Kingdom. . „ . , No title to exemption is recognised in respect of any income from invest ments, &amp;c., in the United Kingdom, e.g., from a holding of British railway shares (see, however, paragraph (6) for an isolated exception m favour of the Heads ot MlSS (4) 1 /recome from House or Land Proper*^.—Where a property is occupied by an individual for diplomatic purposes, including the personal resident of any member of the official or domestic staff (except a British subject on the official staff) he is treated as exempt from any charge to Income-Tax Schedule (B) m respect of the profits of occupation, and also, if he owns the property, from Income-Tax Schedule (A) in respect of the profits of owneiship. No title to exemption is recognised in any other circumstances. (5) When there is income liable to assessment, effect is given, in calculating any duty which may be payable, to the personal allowance (£180 for a married man £100 for a single man) and any other of the usual reliefs which may be applicable These reliefs are given to the same extent as in the case of a United Kingdom resident, in spite of the fact that the diplomatic person is wholly relieved from tax in respect of income arising abroad (see paragraph (3)) m the same way as a person residing outside the United Kingdom. Ufter the appropriate reliefs have been allowed, an assessment is made in the ordinary way. In due course a notice of assessment is issued, and application is made for payment of the duty. [19813] B 3(0) Exemption special to Heads of Missions. The Heads of Foieign Diplomatic Missions in the United Kingdom are, in virtue of a specific provision in the Income-Tax Acts, entitled to exemption from tax in respect of the interest or dividends of any British Government security.

Under Section 20 of “ The Finance Act, 1930,” however, which gives statutory sanction to an old-established concession, they are allowed exemption from income-tax in respect of their official salaries and of fees paid to them in their official capacity, whether by foreign nationals or by British subjects.

The term ‘ ‘ consul ’ ’ is defined in that section of the Act as meaning ‘ £ a person recognised by His Majesty as ‘ being a consul-general, consul, vice-consul or consular agent.’ ” Persons not within this definition, employed on the staff of a consulate, are allowed exemption under the section in respect of their salaries, fees or wages, unless they are British subjects (cf. paragraph 2). 2. Official Agents in the United Kingdom for any foreign State are also entitled, under the section above mentioned, to exemption in respect of their official emoluments, unless they are British subjects or are trade agents in the sense of paragraph (2) (b) of that section. The term ££ official agent ” is defined as meaning £ 1 a person not being a consul, who is employed on the staff of any consulate, official department or agency of a foreign State, not being a department or agency which carries on any trade, business or other undertaking for the purposes of profit.” Annex. Finance A ct, 1930 {Section 20).

(E) Customs Facilities. Foreign Diplomatic and Consular Officers. THE Customs privileges accorded to Foreign Diplomatic and Consular Officers in the United Kingdom are of two kinds :— (1) The normal scale, granted to all countries alike; (2) An additional scale, granted to certain countries on a reciprocal basis, and affecting only certain Diplomatic and Consular Officers inferior in rank to the Head of the Mission. 2. Normal Scale.—The ordinary scale of privileges granted to all Heads of Foreign Missions in this country is as follows :— (a) Exemption from examination of baggage— (1) On first arrival; (2) On subsequent arrival, on production of a baggage pass. (b) Delivery duty-free of imported packages for the personal use of the Head of the Mission and that of his family. This privilege extends to packages imported by parcel post and to imported goods deposited in a bonded warehouse. 3. Reciprocity Scale .—The privileges extended to Diplomatic and Consular Staffs on a reciprocal basis are as under :— Rank of Privileged Officer. Privileges granted. Counsellors, Secretaries and Attaches to As at (a) (1) and (b) above. Embassies and Legations. Consuls-General, and in certain cases Con- As at {a) 1. suls and Vice-Consuls de Carriere.

In each case in which free delivery of imported packages is desired under the reciprocity scale application should be made to the Foreign Office. Similar application should also be made in regard to imported packages intended for any of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, but not addressed as indicated and in regard to imported goods lying in a bonded warehouse. On receipt of the application immediate steps are taken for the delivery of the goods out of Customs charge. 6. The application to the Foreign Office should be in the form of a note bearing the signature of the Head of the Mission and stating for whose individual use the goods to which it relates are intended. It should contain all available9 information as to the marks, &amp;c., on the packages, the date and place of importa tion, the name of the importing ship and the name of the agents entrusted with the clearance of the packages. If the goods are lying in a bonded warehouse, the name of the warehouse should be stated. In the case of a postal package it is • sufficient to make reference in the application to the number and date of the notification which is issued by the postal authorities immediately on the arrival of the package. 7. While no restriction (in the sense of a definitely prescribed maximum limit) is placed upon deliveries of imported dutiable goods to privileged officials, it is expected that the quantities will not be excessive so as to amount to abuse of privilege. 8. Official Supplies. —Articles such as official furniture, stationery, supplies, &amp;c., sent by Foreign Governments for the official use of their representatives in this country are at present normally admitted without examination, on application being made as indicated above.Ko. 226 XV2t7t/43) r t 5 th June, 1^43 r\ c i r» I fctve the honour to rcfar to the Inoone Pill now bulore the Majllti, of Y#hlch tlie general aspects are reported In my despatch Ko.225. 2.

'Revenue provensnt cb 1’stranger'. Does this apply only to income from investments etcetera, or to all income including salaries? 2. Is it intended to charge income tax on all foreign income of persons domiciled in Iran, whether or not such income is actually brought into Iran? According to the Income Tax Law of 20th November 1933, Article 12 (d), the tax is to be paid by 'tous ceux qui resident en Perse et qui y obtiennent des revenus quelconques provenant de l , etranger'. The meaning of 'y obtiennent' is surely that the money is actually remitted to Iran. 3. After what period of residence in Iran does a foreigner become liable to Iranian income tax? 4. Article 15 of the law of November 1933 lays down the rate of tax payable by persons coming under Article 12 (d). Only in the case of incomes exceeding 36,000 rials was the tax to be at the rate of 4%. Persons with lower incomes have thus been legally entitled to pay at lower rates. Will they now be legally compelled to pay at a higher rate? 5. On what grounds is the law made retroactive to 1309? In 'Setareh-ye-Djehane' of October 30th, Monsieur Davar is reported as saying 'il ne s'agit pas d f une imposition retroactive mais de paiement d f un impot que les contribuables ont neglige de payer en temps voulu'. If this is the case, persons who have paid the tax legally due under previous laws will only have to pay at t he new rate from November 1936.tfith reference to ay despatch &gt;o# 631 &gt;i of the 24th December, 1956, I Jutve the honoux 1 to laiform you that isy Cewi«nercial secretary aek»d the tJnaer ieoretary at the Ifialrtrjr of Finance on the 7th January whether ne wa® yet able to give an answer to the questions which he hau adtiressed to hi® on the subject of the recent Iranian Income f £ax i^w* I have the honour to enclose a copy of Simaonda* record of the rej^lies given by Monsieur ader to his questions.

By the new law, the minimum of taxable income is reduced from 5,000 rials (£62 10s., approximately) to 2,400 rials (£30) per annum. The rates of taxes on incomes between 5,000 rials and 20,000 rials are somewhat reduced, but those on incomes between 50,000 rials and 100,000 rials are increased by one half of 1 per cent. 3. Employees on small salaries, and even domestic servants, will now become liable to income-tax for the first time. In their urgent need of funds the Persian authorities are inflicting very heavy burdens on the poorer classes, who have long had to bear the brunt of the heavy taxes on sugar and tea (to provide funds for railway construction), and who have recently been saddled with additional charges in respect of the tax on paraffin and the increased cost of cotton piece- goods resulting from the recent establishment of an import monopoly of those goods. 4.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a law, which was passed by the Majlis on the 15th December, abrogating previous laws on the subject of land taxation, and substituting therefor a uniform tax of 3 per cent, of the value of land produce actually marketed or exported. 2. The previous tax on land was at the rate of 3^ per cent, of all revenue accruing from landed property. This tax was no doubt subject to arbitrary assessment, led to undue hardship and peculation, and required a large staff of revenue officers for its collection. By the new law, property which is unprofit able or unproductive will gain relief. The very extensive estates of the Shah will incidentally (or, more probably, expressly) be relieved from heavy taxation assessments, and will only pay the tax on actual produce. 3.

Translation from Shafagh Surkh dated December 16, 1934. Bill for the Abolition of Taxation on Land and on Live-stock. ARTICLE 1. From the date of the entry into force of this law taxation on land and on live-stock will be abolished, and in its place a tax will be levied on income, as set out in articles 2 and 3. Art. 2. The tax on incomes, as mentioned in the two articles above [sic], will be collected gradually, as the crops, animals and Persian animal products come on to the market in the towns and villages, or are exported. The tax will be on a basis of 3 per cent, on the price of the article which is brought to the town or village or exported. Each article will only be taxed once. Art. 3. The scale of taxation on articles for internal consumption covered by this law will be based on 3 per cent, of the price, with due consideration for weight and quantity, and will be definitely fixed each year. By the 1st Esfand (the 20th February) the tariff for the ensuing year will have been submitted to the approval of the Council of Ministers and a notification to this effect issued. Taxes on articles for export will be collected in silver rials. Regulations for the practical application of the above-mentioned provisions will be passed by the Council of Ministers. Art. 4. With regard to arrears of those taxes which in accordance with this law are abolished, and to the arrears of the repurchase of transferred State domains, the following provisions are laid down :— (a) Tax-payers, who by the end of Shahrivar 1314 (the 23rd August to the 22nd September, 1935) have not made arrangements for the settle ment of their previous tax account in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, will be liable for the payment of this debt up to that date and a fine of one-quarter of the debt in addition to the legal penalty. [315 o—5]/~\ 2 (b) Owners of transferred State domains, who by the end of Esfand 1314 (the 20th February to the 21st March, 1935) have not repurchased their property in accordance with decisions previously taken, will be liable for the payment of the repurchase price plus a fine of a quarter of this amount. The regulations of the Ministry of Finance can be accepted as the basis of claims for a reduction of fines mentioned in sections ($) and (5) of this article. Art. 5. The date of entry into force of this law will be fixed and announced in advance by the Ministry of Finance, with due regard in every area to the harvest season of the year 1314, but in no case later than the end of Tyr (the 22nd July).

Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 16, 1934.) (No. 590.) Sir, Tehran, December 20 , 1933. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a French translation of a new Income Tax Law passed by the Majlis on the 20 th November in substitution for the law which formed the subject of Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 149 of the 6 th April, 1930. 2. The principal changes consist of higher rates levied on profit-earning companies, and the levying of a progressive income tax on merchants and traders according to net profits earned instead of a licence tax graded according to total annual^sales. There is also a reduction and simplification of the categories into which taxpayers are divided. 3. The increase in the tax on companies is illustrated by the following comparative table :— Rials. 0-50,000 50,000-1 million 1 million-10 million 10 million-infinity 1930. Free. 3 per cent. Rials. 0-5,000 5,000-25,000 25,000-100,000 100,000-infinity 1933. Free. 3 per cent. 3£ per cent. 4 per cent. The value of the rial has fallen from about 60 to the gold pound in 1930 to about BO^in 1933. It will thus be seen that, except for companies making profits on the scale of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (who have, however, compounded their taxation in the new concession), the weight of the tax has much increased. 4. Banks, dealers in exchange, &amp;c., no longer appear as a separate category. 5. Merchants (“ comme^ants ”) have now been divided into six categories instead of four, and shopkeepers (“ marchands ”) are by the present law treated in the same way as merchants. Previously no tax was payable by merchants whose annual sales were less than 50,000 rials, and in the higher categories a fixed amount was payable for a licence. By the new law income tax is levied on net profits, so that no exact comparison is possible between the rates levied on the various categories of merchants this year and by the previous rules in force. 6 . Brokers and commission agents disappear as a separate category. 7. Doctors and allied professions are divided into six categories instead of three, but these categories are now fixed by their incomes and not by their general status, and no distinction is made between Tehran and the provinces. It is consequently difficult to make any comparison, but the first class, with an income of 60,000 rials, pays the same tax as a doctor of the first class in Tehran did before (which is half what a merchant with the same income pays). The tax of the lowest class is raised from 600 rials in Tehran and 300 rials in the provinces to 1,000 rials. There are also annual registration fees. The doctors are, however, taxed more lightly than any other category. 8 . Persons following professions of a commercial or industrial nature form a separate group, in which lawyers, previously in the same category as doctors, are presumably included. This group is divided into five classes, according to annual incomes, all those having more than 36,000 rials a year paying 4 per cent., and lower classes pay smaller percentages down to 1 per cent, on incomes of between 5,000 and 6,000 rials. 9. The same scale as is applied to professional men is applied to income derived from abroad. 10 . The remaining category is that of the wage-earners, whether in govern mental or private employ. The fact that the monthly income is quoted as the basis instead of the annual income, as in all other cases, is confusing. There are now five categories instead of four. The full tax of 4 per cent, is paid on all [15 q—5] nCOPY 'K 2033/2053/34) r 17 7 5 1 'c f a ~i o c V. ■* His Majesty f s Representative presents his compliments to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith, copies of the documents mentioned in the subjoined Schedule, on the subject of the Persian Income Tax Law* I Reference; Tehran P.L* No.168 of 2C.4.1930* British Legation, Tehran. 7th April, 1931. — From His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman.

He maintained that he was only called upon to produce the accounts of the Kerman branch. At my suggestion the finance office were asked to state the grounds on which they based their demand and they have now replied quoting Clause I of the Regulations of the law of taxes on Companies, Firms, etc., passed on the 20th Farvardin 1309 (1-4-1930), which reads as follows:- H (Purport). Clause I. All Companies are bound, when they draw up their yearly balance sheet for presentation to the General Committee of share holders, or the Committee of partners, to give a copy to the Finance Ministry or the Local Malieh'.

To His Majesty’s Lnvoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran.COTY, No.5 British Legation, Tehran. 7th April, 1931. Sir, In reply to your despatch No. 10/187 of February 22nd last, I would invite your attention to the fact that in virtue of Article 1 of the 'Rbglement' applying the Income Tax Law, the local financial authorities are only entitled to ask for a copy of the balance sheet drawn up for presentation to the shareholders. This might very well be nothing more than a very rough estimate of the figures eventually approved by the general meeting of the shareholders of the company. This is a defect which the (Government propose to correct in the near future, I understand. 2. Where a company registered outside Persia is bound fry the laws of the country, registration to publish a balance sheet, a copy of the latter could presumably be procured by the Persian authorities should they set out to do so. There would appear at first sight to be little advantage, therefore, in refusing to give the authorities &amp; copy of such a balance sheet should they apply for it* Circumstances may arise, ho?rever, when it would seem almost advisable to make difficulties with a view to secure more reasonable terms. See In this connection the last paragraph of this despatch. 3. F/here a foreign registered company is under no such obligation (to publish a balance sheet) it should be entitled to claim that its accounts are its own private concern, invoking at the same time the Note to Article 14 of Lieutenant Colonel £.W.C.Noel &gt; C.I.S.,D.S.O., His Brltannie Majesty's Consul, KERMAIf.of the Income Tax Law, which states that the inspection of books and registers in order to form am estimate of the tax payable is strictly forbidden. 4. At the same time it should be borne in mind that the financial authorities, if not assisted in their task, may very well resort to highly arbitrary methods, such as the imposition of a tax on every carpet exported, representing their estimate of the profit which is likely to accrue to the company from its sale. 5. In my opinion the Standard Carpet Company would be well advised to take legal advice on so delicate a question. You might possibly refer its german manager to Dr.Macharaff Naficy, 3 Khiaban i Nazemul Atteba, Tehran, who understands English well and is well known to this Legation. 6. Confidential : It may interest you to know that one foreign carpet company operating in Persia (the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers) has claimed that its Persian organisation merely acts in the capacity of commission agents on behalf of its various offices abroad, including of course those of affiliated companies, and that it is consequently only liable to pay the registration fee incumbent on commission agents. This, I am told by the local manager of the company, is strictly true, twenty per cent being charged for manufactures and seven per cent for purchases. The Persian Ministry of Finance, however, has adopted the absurd view that the company should furnish a copy of the balance sheet of every one of its numerous offices dealing in Persian carpets, so as to exact a percentage of the profits realizedrealized on their sale, I understand, incidentally, that the company lost ten thousand pounds as the result of its operations in Persia during the last financial year. 7.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that on the 1st April the Majlis passed the so-called Income Tax Bill, copy of which in translation I beg to enclose herewith. 2. The Bill in question is more comprehensive than an Income Tax Bill, as it includes a tax on business turnover as well as providing a system of licence by taxation for liberal professions. 3. Article 2 (b) will include most British firms trading in Persia as well as firms of other nationalities, and it is here that the Persian Government will presumably derive the most certain revenue. Persian traders may, I think, be trusted to use every artifice to conceal the true amount of their transactions, and the note appended to article 14, forbidding the examination of trade books, will make their task easy. It is difficult to reconcile this note with the text of article 14, as the note stultifies the Bill, and I can only imagine it was added in order to tranquillise the minds of traders and disarm any opposition which might have arisen in the Majlis. When the Bill has been in force for a year or two it should not be difficult to change this decision if necessity should arise—and it surely will arise—for the Persian is only human after all. 4. It is yet too early to predict to what extent the law will affect the Anglo- Persian Oil Company and on what portion of that company’s business the tax will fall. Mr. Jacks has referred the question to London. I may add that 1 asked him whether he had made any estimate as to the liability of the company. He said this was extremely difficult to do at present, but he hoped that, on the present basis, the company would not be liable for more than £d 50,000. 5. The revenue estimated in the present year’s budget from this tax is only Ij million tomans (or £250,000 at the current rate of exchange), but I imagine that that figure is purely imaginary, and it may well be somewhat larger. 'Che Treasurer- General, when asked by the oriental secretary how this figure had been arrived at, replied that the budget was short by million tomans and it had been made up in that way, adding that it w r as obvious, as the sum mentioned was included as the last item on the revenue side. 6. It will be necessary to watch for discrimination as to the incidence between Persians and Europeans, for, whereas the latter keep proper account-books, the Persian merchant in general keeps none or may keep more than one. In either case the revenue authorities will be confronted with a hard task in getting at the true state of their compatriots’ transactions. 7. The liberal professions (article 7) are apparently to grade themselves, for the law seems to provide no means for doing so and it will be interesting to see whether they prefer to be first or third class; the middle way, neither here nor there, may possibly not appeal to any of them.

Persia Income Tax claims against the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Notes of discussion 'between Mr.Baxter, Foreign Office, Mr* Laithwaite, India Office, Mr. \^aterfield and Mr. Bewley , Treasury on April 5th 1930. 1. The India Office said that they would be very reluctant to allow the income tax claim, which affected British revenues only, to be used as a set-off against political or other claims in which India was interested. 2. The Foreign Office said that they had not recent information regarding the income tax claim. They did not know whether the report was true which had appeared in the press to the effect that the Income Tax Bill had become law a few days ago. They had understood that the A.P.O.C. had intended to de &amp;1 with the Persian claim in the course of their private negotiations with the Persian Government ±or a renewal of their concession* 3. The Treasury said that they had been under the same impression until Sir George Barstow telephoned to Mr. Waterfield a few days previously and asked whether the income tax question could not be linked up with the Treaty negotiations. 4. It was pointed out that if Persia had the legax power to tax the Company’s profits in Persia the amount at stake might be very large (the amount of British tax, payable by the Company, was apparently some £1,000,000 per annum). It was not likely that Persia would agree to waive * any part of this continuing claim in retnrn for cancellation of capital debt. The Treasury explained, however, that they had not intended more than that Sir H* Clive should be requested not to make further concessions until the income tax claim has clarified.5. The conference then turned to the question of the order for Persian ships which it now appeared from the tele grams of 28th March, 1930 in 3.34697 that Persia was placing with Italy instead of Great Brit^an as she had half promised. The Treasury took the view that having regard to the instructions, based on a Cabinet decision which had been sent to Sir R.Clive, (see paragraph 14 of the memorandum accompanying F.Q. Cabinet Memorandum of January 8th, 1930, in 3.34697), it would be necessary, supposing the ship purchase scheme should fail, that Sir R.Clive should not commit himself further With out referring home for fresh instructions. Both Treasury and India Office agreed in asking Mr.Baxter to submit to the Foreign Office that instructions to this effect should be ^ sent to Sir R.Clive immediately, and that the Departments concerned should then ba consulted as to the alternative procedure to be followed. 6. It was agreedttet this would have the effect of holding up the negotiations pending enquiry into the income tax position. Meanwhile Mr.Baxter promised that Sir R.Clive be asked to report on this, while Mr.Waterfield undertook to get in touch with Sir George Barstow.Persia: Income-Tax claimed against A.P*Q.C. I asked Sir Percy Thompson how this question stood and find that he is not aware of any further developments. He explains the present position as follows:- 1. It is open to any country to legislate for the exaction of income tax on profits arising from operations within its territory notwithstanding that the operating Company is domiciled elsewhere. This would not prevent the country of domicile from also levying income tax on the whole of the profits of the Company unless it should choose to give exemption in respect of double income tax. Ifoder British law no such exemption can be given. 2. It is impossible to say what proportion of the total profits would arise from local production as opposed to manu facture, marketing etc. elsewhere. The Inland Revenue would endeavour to apply the test of what would be the price obtainable for the products in the country of production, assuring a market existed; but, as in many cases mo such market exists, a settlement usually has to be reached by compromise. Such a compromise might conceivably take the form of allocating half the profits to production and half to manufacture^ etc. but all would depend upon the particular circumstances. 3. As regards the League of Nations discussion, the British oolicy is to abolish double taxation and substitute taxation by the country of domicile only. That naturally benefits a country like Great Britain; but the only support we have got is from Sweden and Switzerland, all tne Owners n. e, not unnaturally, opposed to the proposal. It is not lively that nr)y progress will be made in the near future. 4. To sum up: if therefore the Persians choose to pass the necessary legislation it will be open to them to tax the profits of production in Persia. But that would not prevent us from levying income tax on the whole of the Company’s profi ts includ ing the local profits in Persia. That indeed would be the normal pro cedureprocedure and whether any sort of concession could or should he made to the A.p.O.C. would require very careful considera- tinn.TREASURY” CHA1CBERS, 1st April 1930. WHITEHALL,S.W.1 Dear Monteagle, With reference to our conversation last week I write to say that Barstow rang me up a few days ago on his return from Persia and asked me how the negotiations for a Persian Treaty were going. He was still concerned about the Persian Government’s claim to income-tax in respect of that portion of their revenue which is derived from operations in Persia: he was evidently afraid that Persia might cause considerable embarrassment both to his Company and to His Majesty’s Government by pressing their claim; and he wondered whether the opportunity might not be taken of the general negotiations to get the position settled in our favour. (1) Have you heard anything further from Clive on the income-tax question? The last we had from you was your letter to me of 12th December 1929 (E.5602/703/34). (2) Subject to your views, we are disposed to think that, if Clive haa not yet offered the Persies the further reduction contemj^ated in our war and post-war debt (beyond the £1 million already offered), he should be told not to agree to aiy further reduction except in return for a suitable agreement on the income-tax question. (For the present at least he need not divulge to them what we have in mind). The income-tax question may be of considerable importance from the «£.s.d. point of view, and if it is linked up with the other points in dispute in Taymourtache ’ s mind, it would seem s mistake to surrender any of our cards in advance. If you agree therefor, vie suggest that you should instruct Clive to this effect at once. (3) Do you see any objection to my sending Barstow a copy of your despatch No.32 to Clive of January 15th 1930, enclosing a memorandum on the subject of the Negotiations (E. 36/36/34) for his personal and confidential perusal, and for early return to the Treasury? (It vias decided here recently that papers relating to Persia might, when it seemed desirable, be sent in this way to Barstov/ as Government Director to see and return). Yours sincerely X &amp; V?
