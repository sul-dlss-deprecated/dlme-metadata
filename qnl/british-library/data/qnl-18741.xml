Enclosed is a letter (No. 4752 of 1852) on the subject from Charles Allen, Officiating Secretary to the Government of India to the Chief Secretary to the Bombay Government, dated 18 December 1852.The enclosure states that it is the opinion of the Governor General of India that the cementing of the Maritime Truce among the 'Arabian chieftains' with a permanent peace will be 'very beneficial'; the Resident is therefore authorised to conclude an agreement along the lines he has proposed. It also notes that the practice of presenting annual gifts to chieftains for 'good behaviour' should be maintained.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x000009#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
