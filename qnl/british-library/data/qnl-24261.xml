At a place called A1 Shaghi between Ras al Khaimah and the village of Khatt, which is within Ras al Khaimah territory, Shihuhi shot the Indian dead while he was performing his prayers.took his money and fled to the mountains. 2. Residency Agent proceeded to Ras al Khaimah and informs me that the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah has written to the Shaikh of the Shihuh, Muhammad bin Madhi, who is living at Bai’ah near Dibah to make enquiries about this act committed within his territories of Ras al Khaimah. 3. Bai’ah and Shihuh are under Muscat but I venture to suggest for your and Political Agent’s consideration that H.M.S.Deptford now proceeding to north Batinah coast might be asked to make enquiries at Bai’ah. 4. This course would show that we are taking active interest in matter. First point to determine seems to be whether murdered man was British subject. -POLITICAL-Teleg^-am Cr.T.C.

The Political Agent, Muscat, replied that the Muscat Governaent were writing letters to the Shaikh of the Shihuh tribe to surrender Abdullah bln Salim for trial at Muscat in the Muscat Court. The Muscat Government duly sent their letter to the Shaikh of the Shihuh, who denied that the aturder had been committed by one of his tribe and declared that he would only arrest the accused man if proof of his guilt was forthcoming. As there was a clear ±.rim facie case against Abdullah bin fcalia and as the Muscat Government*s request was merely tn&amp;t he should be surrendered for trial, the Shihuh Shaikh 1 s refusal was quite unreasonable. 5. Major Watts then discussed the matter with the Sultan on his visit by . oyal Air force 'plane to DhofAr., The bultan wanted further enquiries to be made as to tue guilt of Abdullah and instructed his representative at Muscat to send an investigator to the Shihuh territory. Major $*tts also had sent his Interpreter to Bai'ah ana Dibah with the same object. • The result of these further enquiries which X have received from the Political Agent, Muscat, go to substantiate the guilt of Abdullah bin Salim. facts withtne addition that the Indian was a Monaansea&amp;n 6* Efforts were made to ascertain the name of the Incian 4 I then telegraphed the Political Agent, Muscat, tot * Cjcj 6* X then instructed Me3or Watts to suggest to the Muscat GoTernsent that they should send a jfinal letter to the Shihuh Shtij&amp;h ashing for the surrender of Abcullrh bln $©11®• Tno luscat Government have sent this letter givxng the fchihuh ShaUrh until the hrd ^uly to surrender Ahaullah, 7.

At the same time the lult&amp;n in his interview with Major Watts referred to above recognised that his State can bring no effective pressure to bear on the Shihuh Shaikh and has suggested that action be taken by His Majesty’s Sloops. . As will be seen,thorough enquiries indicate v is a strong prim^ H ci&amp; case against Abdullah bin SaliJU According to our information the Indian having engaged Abdullah to t&amp;ke him to Has &amp;1 Kiiaimah actually set out in company with him. The next thing we heard about the Indian was his being found murdered in has al Khalmah territory and that Abdullah had shot him, taken his money and fled to the mountains.

The murder victim, who was never identified, had travelled to the Trucial Coast from Karachi via Muscat and Diba, on his way to Dubai. The alleged murderer was identified as his hired travelling companion, the camel driver Abdullah bin Salim bin Malkash of Diba and a member of the Shihuh [Shiḥūḥ] Tribe, in the jurisdiction of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman and under the governorship of the Wali of Khasab. The Shihuh Shaikh Muhammad bin Mahdi and his tribe, who were living at Bai’ah near Diba, successfully resisted attempts by the British and Muscat authorities to force them to surrender the alleged murderer who, although never prosecuted, was later reported to have died at Diba in April 1939, after being bitten by his camel. The main correspondents are: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Bahrain and the Residency Agent at Sharjah, whose reports are in Arabic as well as English. Included in the correspondence are three letters in Arabic written respectively by Shaikh Sultan bin Salim the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah [Al Qasimi, Shaikh Sultan bin Salim], Rashid al Abdullah the Chief of Rab Rab village in Ras al Khaimah territory, and Muhammad bin Salman, an inhabitant of the Trucial Coast.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Shiḥūḥ (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Ras al Khaimah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Criminal investigation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Murderers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000268#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
