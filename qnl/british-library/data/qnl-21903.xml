The mother of pearls required must be of a minimum thickness of three-sixteenths of an inch and the diameter must be not less than five inches# Furthermore, the shell should be without flaws, regularly formed, fairly flat, as colourless as possible and free from small pin holes. I have been asked to telegraph whether I can arrange the supply required and if so by what date and at what cost. Since you are in closer touch with the pearl market than I am, I shall be grateful for your advice and assistance in dealing with this enquiry. Yours sincerely, C.

D.0.No. • Bahrain, November 29, 1942, Ay The pearl shells described in your D.O.No. 0/1784 dated the 28th November, 1942, are known as Sadaify shells. At present they are being bought up by one 3yed Hassan bin Syed Alawi who is purchasing for a Mr. H.S. Cross of the Gerdau-India Corporation, 24, Peoples Building, Sir p. Mehta Road, Fort, Bombay. Mr. Cross was put in touch with Syed Hassan by Victor Rosenthal of Bombay. The shells are to be shipped to New York or Bombay. Syed Hassan is reluctant to sell the shells which he has bought because by doing so he might upset his business relations with Rosenthal and it is unlikely that we can obtain 2,600 shells from other sources in Bahrain as 3yed Hassan has been buying extensively. I suggest that the authority in India requiring the shells should be put in touch with Mr. Cross at once and perhaps they could be bought from him. 'y .0 3. B. 7/akefield, Fsquire, I.C.S., H. B.

Enquiries along the Trucial Coast show that there is a large stock of Sadaify shells in the hands of a Persian merchant at Diba. The quantity there is estimated at 9,000 lbs. There are also stocks of Sadaify shells at Dubai and Ajman aggregating about 5,000 lbs. There is said to be a big demand from India for these shells and the price has risen about 2003 during the winter. 3. The price of shells varies from Rs 1/4 to fe 2/- per 9 lbs. Cleaning charges are about 6 annas per 9 lbs. The majority of those available are probably not sufficiently flat to meet the requirements of the Mathematical Instrument Office Calcutta. Shells which are large and flat mainly come from Abu 2* f usa island and it would probably take 6 months to collect the quantity required. 4. If it is desired to pursue this line of enquiry I suggest that an agent be sent to Sharjah from Calcutta to indicate, by selection from samples, exactly what is required.

Defence e --.iOusands oi tons o_ coral are beirxg orovided by local labour every month, partly for V.A.D. works at A\;ali and partly for the soling of a large area of soft ground which divides the Civil from the 'C.A.F 1 . aerodrome st muharraq. The coral is cut from the sea sho^e when the tide is low, is loaded into small boats and is dumoed at the nearest convenient pier or jetty. The progress of the works at Awali and huharraq is limited not by” the supply of coral available, which is inexhaustible, nor by shortage of labour, of which there is plenty, but by ^ne number of small boats availaole for use in transoorting the coral from sea to land. A ''trial’’ order has now' been received -rom Basrah for 1C,CCC tons of coral to be deliver ed witnin a mont}i. Acceptance of the order would give much- needed local employment; but it is doubtful whether there so large a requisition to be fulfilled without interfering with the progress of local works, 'he question is being given careful thought.Office of the © No.4. hear bir.

Political Agent, BahrainThe Adviser to the Bahrain Government, B A H K A I N . Sir, I have the honour to state that the Navy gave a contract to Abdur Kasool Toorani, a local contractor in •••• 1942 to supply coral for the construction of a jetty at Jeddah Island. The first boat load of coral was dischargee by him at the Island on.••••••• Abdur Kasool Toorani sub sequently claimed that he had delivered 625 boat loads of coral valued at ••••. It was suspected that he had not delivered the amount which he claimed to have delivered. To confirm this suspicion, experts were appointed to ascertain (a) the amount of coral used in the construction of the jetty and (b) the amount of coral which would have been discharged at Jeddah Island if 625 boat loads had in fact been supplied. Captain K.H.Shaw, an officer of the Koyal Engineers and Lieut. W.S.Goss, N.O.I.C measured the jetty and the coral lying un used beside it. They found that the amount of coral used in the construction of the jetty was 17,928 cubic feet and that the amount of coral lying near the jetty and not used in its construction was 400 cubic feet. Three local dealers in coral,viz. Ibrahim bin Abdur Hazzaa, 3yed Ebrahim bin Syed Shabbar and Khalil bin Ibrahim, measured a boat load of coral and r eported that what they considered to be a boat load of coral contained one hundred and twelve and half (112£ ) cubic feet. In short, the total amount of coral actually Supplied by Toorani was 18,328 cubic feet or at the rate of 112£ cubic feet per boat load ••••••••• boat loads. But he has claimed payment for 625 boat loads which, at the rate of 112£ cubic feet per boat load would amount to 70,312 cubic feet* of coral. As the amount of coral actually supplied by Toorani was only boat loads as against 625 boat loads charged for by him, he has tried to cheat the Navy to the extent of Hs. 3003/8/- being the value, at Hs.6/8/- per boat load, of •••• boat loads. I request therefore that criminal proceedings may be instituted against him- 2. The reports of the experts on the measurement of an average boat load and of the coral actually supplied by Toorani are attached herewith. 3. The names of the witnesses are ;- (1) Captain. K.H.Shaw. (2) Lieut, h.W.S.Goss. (3) Ibrahim bin Abdur hazzan. (4) Syed Ibrahim bin Syed Snabbar. (5) Khalil bin Ibrahim. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Naval Officer-in-ChargeI saw Captain Laxton, Housings Officer, Basra, on 24th March. He asked me to get Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad to agree to release his house to the military authorities (for use by Major Hills) with effect from 1st of April. The Housings Officer is prepared to pay rent at the rate of fo 225/- p.m. or, if Chaikh Abdullah prefers, n/ 275 /- p.m. for the first six months and Ps 200/- p.m. subsequently. I understood from Captain Laxton that he had interviewed Shaikh Abdullah in Mr. Belgrave's presence and that Shaikh Abdullah had expressed his willingness tovacatethe house from the 1st of August but was unwilling to leave it before then. He even offered to let the military authorities have the house free of rent if the time of occuoation could be delayed till 1st of August. 2. I discussed the matter subsequently with Major Hills who told me that when negotiations for the rent of this house began Shaikh Abdullah asked for tis 300/- p.m. Major Hills offered Bs 275/- p.m. which'Shaikh Abdullah was willing to accept. At this stage of the proceedings, when Major Hills was about to write to Baghdad for authority to take the house on the rent agreed, the housings Officer anoeared in Bahrain and took over the negotiations. The result of the Housings Officer’s has been unfortunate and it will not be easy to get Shaikh Abdullah to agree to me the terms now offered. Major Hills informs/that it would be a great convenience for him to have this house in Manama but that it can by no means be described as a 'military necessity'. 3. I will discuss the question with Mr. Belgrave before approaching Shaikh Abdu'.lah. (If Major Hills secures the use of the house certain improvements will be carried but to which Shaikh Abdullah agrees). 4.

To: THE ADVISER TO THE BAHRAIN GOVERNOJKT, BAHRAIN, I have the honour to state that the Navy gave a contract to Abdur Rasool Tooranl, a local contractor, in October 1942, to supply coral for the construction of a jetty at Jeddah Island, The first boat load of coral was discharged by him at the Island in October. Abdur Rasool Toorani subsequently claimed that he had delivered 700 boat loads of coral valued at Rs.5950/-. 2. It was suspected that he had not delivered the amount which he claimed to have delivered. To confirm this suspicion, experts were appointed to ascertain (a) the amount of coral used in the construction of the Jetty and (b) the amount of coral which would have been discharged at Jeddah Island If 700 boat loads had in fact been supplied. 3. Captain R.E.Shaw, an officer of the royal ngineers, and Lieutenant G. . .Goss, Acting Naval Officer-in-Charge, Bahrain, measured the jetty and the coral lying unused beside it. They found that the amount of coral used in the construction of the jetty was 17,928 cubic feet and that the amount of coral lying near the jetty and not used in its construction was 400 cubic feet. 4. Three local dealers in coral, vis. Ibrahim bin abdur Razzaq, Syed Ebrahira bin Syed Shabbar and iOialil bin Ibrahim, measured a boat load of coral and reported that what they considered to be a boat load of coral contained one hundred and twelve and a half (112's) cubic feet. 5. In short, the total amount of coral actually supplied by Toorani was 18,328 cubic feet or at the rate of 112i cubic feet per boat load 163 boat loads. But he has claimed payment for 700 boat loads which, at the rate of 112^ cubic feet per boat load would amount to 78,750 cubic feet of coral. 6. As the amount of coral actually supplied by Toorani was only 163 boat loads as against 700 boat loads charged for by him, he has tried to cheat the Navy to the extent of Rs.4,564/As.08, being the value, at Rs.8/ab. 0S per boat load, of 537 boat loads. I request therefore that criminal proceedings may be instituted *&lt; against him. 7. The reports of the experts on the measurement of an average boat load and of the coral actually supplied by Toorani are attached herewith. 8. The names of the witnesses are:- (1) Captain R.H.Shaw.

I, with thinks, like to point out to you that discussions took place with the British forces for renting the above house some months ago. At that/your friend (he) was in position to rent this house because I do not live in it during winter. Now summer season is approaching during which I and my family live in this house, because I own no house for summer time except this. Due to this reason I very much regret for my non ability to rent it at present. A. C I have been honoured with £he receipt of your n honoured &gt;MM UV Political Agency, Bahrain, 15th pr^il 1^3 1 am sorry to have uo tell yaw that Ihaikh bdullah bln H«omad al 'hallfah declines politely, but with the utmost firmness, to le^-se out his house in ‘'udhnibiyah for the coming summer. The difficulty is now not in connection with the amount of rent offered, for 1 very much doubt whether Shaikh bdullah would accept even -s. 1000 a month for his house. The trouble is that haikh \bdullah was aggrieved and hurt by the rttitude which aptain Laxton adopted towards him during the negotiations which that officer unfortunately undertook in person. 2. This is the first occasion on which an o^icer without experience of local conditions has attempted to obtain facilities for one of the Services, and this is the first time that facilities have been refused. 1 am sorry that the failure should have occurred in a case in which you are personally interested. 3. 1 am sending a cony of this letter to ’ev itt.

M’s Political Agent, The Political Agency, Manama, Bahrein Kindly refer to your letter No C/1491 of the 4th November,1943 regarding the rumour that the contractors for the Refinery Extension are proposing to import liquors for the use of their workmen. • To the best of my knowledge there is no basis for this rumour and all liquors for the consumption of both the company employees and those of the contractor will be handled and controlled by the company in the same manner as in the past. two shipments each containing approximately 28,000 small bottles (12 oz.) American beer. The company has received copies of placement orders which indicate that its New York office has placed orders for five additional similar shipments. These shipments as well as any subsequently arranged have or will be included in the company’s regular applications for liquor permits. It has now been brought to my attention that the company’s New York office contemplate the placement of orders for 400 cases of Canadian Whiskey and 100 cases American Bourbon whiskey. I have no information as to if or when this whiskey may be ordered or shipped. It has also been brought to my attention that the company has been offered and is now negotiating for 200 cases of Seagers Gin. I am unable to state if this deal may be consummated. One other shipment of which I am advised is that a certain amount of South African wine, brandy and cordials is now enroute to Bahrein for the company. I have no definite information as to this shipment but it is believed to be small. for liquors, the above mentioned whiskey, gin and wine were not taken into consideration in arriving at the quantities required because of the indefiniteness of their receipt. You may rest assured that I will keep you advised of any infor mation received of liquor from other than regular sources and that the company will handle and control all liquors for their and the contractor’s staff employees and that all liquors will be included in the company’s applications for liquor permits.

From the statements made the events emerge' quite flcnrly and to a large extent rare cadmitted by I!r. F.S.Gilson. He had started drinking at the ~lub at 5.30.p*m. on 2-11-44 and with intervals for food and a game of di^e, he had been drinking fairl 2 r steadily all the evening up till 9 p.m. He then decided to walk home. On the way he saw a bus going in his direction and signalled it for a lift. The bus appeared to swerve towards him and nearly ran him down. This in^Assed him highly and he went to the Transport Office to lodge a ^om- plaint. He was angry and abusive and burst into the office shouting. It is only here that stories differ. Mr. A^korley and the despat-her TTassein of the Transport Office allege that Mr.Gilson first seized Hasson and abused him, and on Mr .A^kerley’« intervening he turned and .seized Mr. A^kcrley by the throat. (Hasson states he struck Mr ./-^kerley). T ' r r. A^kerl.ey then knocked him dovm and on his getting up and grappling with Mr.A^kerley he was again floored by the native staff. • Mr.Gilson asserts that on his entry into the office and his use of excited and abusive language he was surrounded by jabbering natives. He may have pushed one ba^k from ^oming too near. He was then knocked down by Mr. /&gt;kerley and Was set on by the native staff while he was on the floor. Hq then picked up a spring leaf lying on the floor and brandished it at his assailants, who ran out of the office. A blow‘he aimed at Mi-A-kerley, as he was going through the door fortunately ^aught the edge of the door.

In my view his actions on this violence (and there is some doubt in ny mind on the point) cannot be said, to be enough to warrant his doportatjon from the island as a character whose presence here is prejudicial to public 'order and security. 1 therefore propose to take no action £ apart from warning Mr. hilson to be of good behaviour in future. one occasion, even if he were the first to engage in physical ^ - I i L+i*TS is\ Statement of Fred.E/ ilson, 45, 1,r elder B.M.P.

Then I had a few more drinks. I felt I was getting a bit drunk and decided to go home. As ^ w a ^ . walking home I saw a bus and held up my hand for a lift. The bus ran me dov/n. I went to the Transport Office to complain about the driver and to find who he was. I was pretty sore and I admit I shouted. There were coolies there v/ho all started jabbering at me. The white man there said something to me and then came up and socked me. I got up and defended myself but all the coolies set on me. I picked up a spring to defend myself, and all the coc lies ran out. I made a hit at the white man and hit the door. The next thing I remember is I was home in my room when a lot of fellows came in. I cant remember a word of the conversation. I went on up to the club after they left and got some cigarettes. I met Capt. Johnson there and he took me home. Te walked around outside for q .ite a v\ while and then I went to bed. I deny striking anyone until I was struck and my only action was to defend myself. tm. I*—, -JT 7-3^^.

At 9.45 pm.on 2.ii.44 I was bailed from my house by a native driver from the Transport section who told me that an American was creat ing a disturbance at Transport and had hit Mr.Ackerley. I tried to get in touch with Captain Johnson but failed. I therefpre set out to Transport myself, picking up Mowett, Kippan and a British serjeant. T,T hen I got to Transport neither the American or Ackerley were there. The native staff were considerably excited and were unwilling to ret urn to work as they were afraid the American would return. He was last seen going towards the big bunkhouse with a big spring in his hand. 7e went on to the bunkhouse and found the American 'ilson there. I asked him the reason he had caused trouble at transport and he reulied that he had gone to Transport to get transport to his house in the camp and that for no reason someone had struck him. I saw no point in carrying the matter further that night and we left. The spring was found outside the bunkhouse by one of the narty, r ilson was drunk but ruite coherent. He was quite civil, but appeared to be still'ancrry at what had happened before. ✓1 / Statement of Captain Johnson, 58, Petroleum Co.Bahrein. Captain of the Gurads Bahrein I was called out at about 10.30 P.M. on Thursday night as there was trouble in the Transport section. On investigation I £ound that that a man called Vi H on had been there using abusive language and had assaulted Mr.Ackerley. I investigated further and was pointed out ''ilson at the Club. He was observed by me for some time and was not behaving then in an unduly boisterous manner. I saw him disnlay a handkerchief to two friends, the handkerchief had blood on it'. I took I.r. Vilson back to the bunkhouse in a bus. On Friday morning I took vr ilson r s statement. He complained that he had tried to get a lift home on a bus which had swerved as if to run him down instead of stopping and giving him a lift. He had gone to T Transport to complain and had been assaulted without reason by a white man and two coolies, -^e admitted being abusive but denied striking anyone. He had returned to the bunkhouse and had then been interviewed by four men, one of whom was the white man who struck him. One of the bunkhouse doors had been broken and I asked Wilson if he had done this. He said he could not remember but he might have thrown the spring at it.
