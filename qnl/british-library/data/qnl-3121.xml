                           Teignmouth, presents from His Highness Ibrahim Khaun [Ebrāhim Khan], Governor of Kermaun [Kermān], to the Honourable Governor of Bombay, Mountstuart Elphinstone. Dow explains that he would have reported the receipt of the presents earlier if it were not for the fact that the letter from the Governor, which accompanied the presents, was addressed to the Resident, William Bruce, whose return from India is expected daily. Dow reports that as the person employed by His Highness to convey the presents to Bushire happened to be a man of some considerable rank, he felt it necessary to present him with a sum of money equal to 800 Bombay rupees. Dow encloses a copy of the aforementioned letter from His Highness to Bruce, together with a list of muskets which His Highness has requested that the Resident procure for him. The enclosures are not included.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x000092#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
