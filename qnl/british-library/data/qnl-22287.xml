Dear Belgrave, Please refer to your Demi-Official letter No.718-43 dated the 7th April, 1946. 2. I notice that both Beeby phompson and Tunnicliffe are on higher scales of salary than the State Engineer. This situation obviously calls for a review and the time to do this would appear to be on the expiry of Group/Captain Leigh's present contract. 3. Perhaps you will let me have your proposals to increase the scale of the State Engineer which, prima facie,' appears to be low compared with the increased importance of the engineering side of the State's administration and ■ compared with his subordinate engineers. Yours sincerely, Sd./- A.C. GALLOWAY D. Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser .to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.Confidential. GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. D.O.No. 37- Bahrain, November 28, 1946. 5 3 With reference to your D.O.No. C/510 dated 19th May, 1946, on the subject of the agreement of the State Engineer, Group Captain Leigh. 2. Group Captain Leigh’s basic pay according to his original agreement was Rs.1,000/- per month, in addition he received the following allowances Dearness allowance Rs. 75/- per month. . v c Provident Fund 124/- n e/ ■ J Electricity 50/- * \ Petrol 35/- T» % ' His total monthly emoluments amounted to Es. 1,284/ 3. In addition Group Captain Leigh has received more generous terms in the way of passages than any other Bahrain Government official. At the commence ment of his service he received passages from U.K. for himself and for Mrs. Leigh and after completing his first two years’ agreement he became entitled to the value of two sea passages, Bahrain-U?Kv, worth, approximately Rs.3,690/-, he also receives the value of a return passage to Karachi after each year’s service. This arrangement about passages for Mrs. Leigh was made by the India Office before he came out without the prior approval of the Bahrain Government. Most other British officials receive one home passage only once in four years. 4. Group Captain Leigh has now written to me stating that he would like his contract to be renewed for a further three years with the follow! rg changes in his pay and allowances Payj To be increased as a flat rate for a period of three years by 50$ or alter natively by an initial increase of 25$ and reasonable succeeding increments. Provident Fund; To be increased pro rata. petrol allowance; Free issue of petrol or alternatively an increase of Hs.10/- per month. Electricity allowance: A free supply or an increase of Rs.20/- per month, if the latter, the matter to be reconsidered when air conditioning becomes available. 2 /— Confidential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT.9 © 2 5. I have discussed the matter with His Highness who is averse to an extension for three years hut would approve an extension of Group Captain Leigh f s contract for two years with a reasonable improvement in his salary. Group Captain is an exceedingly hard working and keen official and in my opinion is very competent on the technical side of his own work though not experienced in financial and long term policy. I believe that it would be advantageous for the State to retain him for a further two years. I would propose to offer him a new contract with the following changes; basic pay to be Hs. 1,250/- per month, rising after 12 months from the date of completion of his original contract to Rs. 1,350/-. Provident Fund Rs.200/-. Free petrol. Electricity allowance of Rs.60/- per month while occupying Government quarters. Other officials pay for their own electricity but it is a general practice for the person in charge of an electricity dndertaking either to receive free electricity or an allowance in lieu. A passage for himself and for Mrs. Leigh to U.K. from Bahia in, on completion of the two years and a passage for himself to and from Karachi after the completion of the first year but not on the completion of the second year, at which time he will receive a passage to the U.K. 6. Before offering these new terms to Group Captain Leigh I should like your views on my suggestions. I regret that there has been much delay in the matter but I have until recently been^ible to obtain His Highness’s definite views on the subject. Lieut. Colonel A.C. Galloway, O.B.E., H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain.*• | ^ D* 0. No.C/1387. POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 15th of December, 1946. My dear colonel Hay, Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with your Memorandum ?Jo. 1730-59/9 dated the 29th of April, 1946?' 2. Leigh’s contract has now expired and Belgrave has written to me saying that His Highness wishes to re-engage him for a further period of two years on an increased rate of salary. The proposed rates are as follows: 'I would propose to offer him a new contract with the following changes; basic pay to be Rs.1,250/- per month, rising after 12 months from the date of completion of his original contract to Rs.1,350/-. provident Fund Rs.200/-.

Other officials pay for their own electricity but it is a general practice for the person in charge of an electri city undertaking either to receive free electricity or an allowance in lieu. A passage for himself and for Mrs. Leigh to U.K. from Bahrain, on completion of the two years and a passage for himself to and from Karachi after the completion of the first year but not on the completion of the second year, at which time he will receive a passage to the U.K.' 3. You will see from Bahrein telegram No.717 dated the 14th August, 1944, to the India Office, London, repeated to you, that the Bahrain Government first objected to Leigh’s appointment on the grounds that a younger man was required, but havenow dropped that and are, in fact, satisfied with his work. The retiring age has been under stood in general principle for British personnel employed by the State to be 55 years of age. At the moment this concerns Leigh only, but will in a very few years affect Belgrave in whose case the principle, it seems, is to be applied, vide Sir Geoffrey prior’s letter No.c/94 dated the 16th May, 1946, to Shaikh Salman. ^ B 4. Leigh has, I know, done excellent work in bringing order out of the chaotic state of Bahrain’s electricity supply, and he deserves consideration if only on that ground. It would have been extremely difficult and resulted in nothing being done if we had started a year ago (which would have been necessary) to look for a successor. 5. Leigh’s case must, I think, be governed by the /principle.... The Hon’ble Lt-Col. W.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain . ' , - .... ; ...principle, but as neither of the other State officials with engineering experience is suitable or available for the post of State Engineer, and because there is a new electric-power plant on the way out for installation, and since Leigh has experience of this work gained during the last year he should, I think, be offered a contract for one more year. If you agree, will you please let me know? I shall then review Belgrave’s proposals for an increase in Leigh’s pay for the remainder of his time here, and also suggest to him that he discusses with me the problem of Leigh’s relief in good time. Yours sincerely,Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, D#0#No*50-59/9 • 7th January, 1947. I am desired by Colonel Hay to say that he accepts the proposal regarding Leigh’s re-appointment made in paragraph 5 of your demi-official letter No. C/1387 dated the 15th December, 1946, and to add that arrangements for his relief should be taken up not Lt* Col.

In view of the delay you may have some difficulty in which case, since the period is short, I suggest you meet him half way. These terms need not necessarily form a precedent for the emoluments of the future incumbent of the post. 4. rill you please take up the engagement of a new State Engineer with me at once, remembering that this may be a convenient opportunity of re-organising the engineering department of the Steele’s administra tion?

No. 37/39-3P dated 28th November to you, it was after I had discussed the matter with His Highness who fully agreed with the suggestion that Leigh should be retained for a further two years from the end of tue present contract, which was last November^ at the increased rate of pay which I suggested. 1 have now shown to His Highness your letter of 14th January and His Highness wishes me to en quire why the extension of Leigh's agreement for two years from the expiration of his original agreement is objected to. I feel myself that to take on a new State Engineer at a time when so much important work is on hand in the Electric Department is like changing horses in mid-stream. As far as reorganising the engineering department this has already been done and it cannot be said that anything of Steele's administration now remains. Under these circumstances I should be grateful if you would reconsider the period for which Leigh's agreement should be extended. Lieut. Colonel A.C.

The 2nd of February, 1947 My dear Redgrave, Will you please refer to your letter No.C/453-39SF of the 27th January, 1947? further period of one year only is that he has long passed the normal Gulf super-annuation age. At the outset it was stated that Leigh was over-age, but this condition was waived owing to the impossibility of finding anyone else in war time. In your letter No.1576-23 of the 25th August, 1945, it was stated that his contract was for a period of two years only, and was not likely to be extended; presumably on account of his age since his efficiency is not in question. 3. Leigh was born on 4.1.1889 which will make him just under 59 at the time of expiry of his present contract. It is most unwise for the Bahrain Government to employ officers over 55, but in the present case they are bound to. 4. I don* t see how the question of changing horses in mid-stream comes into the picture since electrical development is in its infancy in Bahrain. A change must be made, and now is the time to get on with it even if a new plant is en route. For the installation of the last plant the services of a special engineer were obtained, and whether they are or not for the next plant is immate rial since Leigh's successor should be able to carry on from where Leigh leaves off. This is quite normal in all services. 2 The reason for extending Leigh's contract for a yours sincerely, C.O. Belgrave, ysq., Adviser to the Bahrain Government .Bahrain. NS.(?)

Dear Colonel Hay, please refer to rresponde-nce ending with Residency Endorsement No.541-S dated the 31st March, 1947, about Leigh’s extension in Bahrain Government service. talked for about an hour. His relevant statements were: (1) The first mention of an extension of his original two years contract was made to him by Belgrave in July, 1946. (i.e., Belgrave) (2) He/gave him the impression that his contract would be extended for at least two years and he regulated his private affairs accordingly. He will be put to inconvenience if it is not. (3) He feels that one year’s extension will be regarded by^opinion here as ’’throwing him out” — and^reflection upon him and his work.. (4) He is keen to stay on, and having begun to put the Bahrain electric installation in good order would like to finish the job. 3. .1 shall leave point (1) for comment last. As regards (2) it is difficult to be sure / whether Leigh's own wishful thinking or Belgrave’s probable assumption of authority to himself which he did not possess - to be sure which contributed more to the false impression which Leigh cherished. I am chary of assuming that Belgrave was wholly to blame. (3) is sheer sentimentality, and I don’t think Leigh himself attaches very much importance to it. I 2. Leigh came to see me on the 8th of April and /impressed The Hon'ble Lt-Coi. W.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., political Resident in the Persian Gulf B ahrain. — ^ ^ ! \- 2 - 2-Vfi) impressed upon him that we were all pleased with his work, and that his extension was being opposed on a matter of principle. (4) is a laudable sentiment and seems fairly genuine. 4. What I propose is that I should write to Belgrave and ask him whether Leigh’s statement at (1) is correct. If he says that it is, it will be possible then to place upon Belgrave’s shoulders even more squarely (I propose to place it in any case) the responsibility for the difficulty we have had in dealing with this case and for the fact that we shall have to reverse our orders, as. I suppose, we shall ultimately have to do; we cannot, I think, at this juncture be faced with the prospect of Leigh's going in October. Whether Belgrave took the matter up without consulting the political Agent in July, 1946, or not, he did not write to Galloway until November, 1946, suggesting the two years’ extension of Leigh’s contract, i.e., he waited until his previous contract had expired before taking any action to get it renewed. Fie explains that M I regret that there has been much delay in the matter, but I have until recently been unable to obtain His Highness’ definite views on the subject”. Furthermore, when informing Belgrave that you had agreed to the extension of Leigh’s contract for a period of one year only, Galloway asked him in January to take up the engagement of a new State Engineer with him at once. He has not done so yet,.and has confined himself to arguing about the orders, vide correspondence sent under Agency printed Letter NckC/ 144 , dated the 4th February, 1947. This is a case in fact in which the Shaikh having failed to ask for our advice, has refused * to accept our ruling and his Adviser has, practically speaking, g. v° /made it3 made it impossible to carry that ruling out. if we have to concede the two years this should be pointed out, and it should be made clear that it is only because of these circumstances that the two years 1 extension is being granted; and we should, of course, put in the usual clause, so often a face saver, as in this case, against this instance being quoted as a precedent. Yours sincerely2* I concur in your conclusions and the line of action you propose to take. 3. I should be glad to know whether there is anything to support the statement made in paragraph 3 of Galloway»s demi-official letter Ho.

As you are aware, De Grenier's services were dispensed with ostensibly for the reason that he had reached the age of 55 (reference Wakefield’s demi- official letter No.c/184, dated the 11th February, 1943 to prior). 1 (ii) Please also see prior’s dispatch No.398-S dated the 5th April, 1946, to the Govern ment of India - paragraph 8 of the ’’Note on discussions with Mr. Belgrave”.

As I mentioned to you in conversation Belgrave reaches the age of 55 in December 1949 and I think perhaps we might call the Shaikh’s attention to this fact in or about December of this year and suggest to him that the time has come to appoint an assistant to Belgrave who, if he proves suitable, might in due course take over from him.

It is probable that he will wish to take leave during the summer of 1948 as he did not go away during 1947 and has leave to his credit. I think therefore that it is time to begin looking for a replacement for Leigh. 2. The post is that of State Engineer but in fact this title is something of a misnomer as the duties consist of running the electric undertaking, trans port and the bridge. He is not responsible for public works which includes buildings, roads and upkeep of Government property nor is he concerned with oil inspection. 3. There is at present in England a dearth of Engineers and it may be difficult to find a suitable person. I propose writing to Callenders Cables Company, with whom we have had dealings for many years, and to Mirrlees Bickerton and Day, to ask whether they could recommend anyone, if we have no results from them I will insert an advertisement in some of the home papers, unless by any chance you can recommend any suitable candidate.

Stat e Engineer , With further reference to your letter of the 22nd December last, I am afraid I have not beeta very successful in finding you an Electrical Engineer: I (1) There is a Mr. Brammer, who is at present with the Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., and who from all reports is a first-class electrical engineer. I heard that he was intending to resign from Qatar and, if he did, I believe it would be worth your while seeing him. You might have a word with Mr. Skinner about him. It is only if he is resigning from Qatar that you should consider him, as I should not like to be a party to the enticement of any of the Qatar staff, but Skinner will advise you of the position. I enclose his papers. (2) I enclose papers of a Mr. C.R. Taylor. He might suit you. He is going to Quaite this week for one of the oil companies, and I have given him a letter of introduction to you, as he expects to be in Bahrain and you might see him. (3) I enclose papers of a Mr. W.M. Sochard. When you have read these over and if you think he might suit, I can see him again and obtain any further information you require. N (4) I enclose papers of a Mr. C.J. Smyth, and the same remarks apply as for (3). Sorry I have not been able to help more effectively, and of them'all I think C.J. Smyth, No.4 above., is the most likely. I believe however that Mr. Brammer is quite a possibility, and I think you should follow this up. Please let me know if you want me to do anything more. You may have to see people yourself when you are again in London. You might also discuss your problem with Sandy Reid when he is again in Bahrain, as he will be coming home this summer and might be able to do something.

His Britannic Majesty’s Political Bahrain. • Sir ST 11 TE ENGINEER’S CONTRACT - BAHRAIN G0VER1EECNT I have the honour to refer to the above subject and to state that I was notified by the Adviser to the Government on 19th June,1948 that my services would not be required after the completion of my existing contract in November,1948. As a Chartered Mechanical Engineer with over thirty years Electrical and Mechanical engineering experience, I am convinced that a change of control at the present moment will inevitably result in serious delay in completion of the extensive work which I have planned and commenced,and will not be in the best interests of the Bahrain Government. Outstanding work to be completed consists of the following major commitments:- a) Construction of foundation and installation of one 300 kW generating set due for delivery in July,1948. b) Preparation of foundation and installation of tv/o 55 kW generating sets due for delivery almost immediately. c) Dismantling and removal of two 100 kW generating sets and their associated equipment. d) Preparation of foundation and installation of two 350 kW generating sets due for delivery in July,1949 e) Preparation of site and construction of cooling pond and one 30,000 gallon per hour water cooling tower due for delivery In November,1948. f) Erection of one 10 Ton/24 hours water distillation plant for the existing generating plant and new plant on order. g) The balancing of all sub-station distribution loads to equalise main feeder supplies to the distribution net work. The foregoing major commitments have been planned by myself and the necessary plant has been specified and ordered, and I could without question have satisfactorily completed the wcfrk within the next two years. P.T.OI' 2 ' In view of -the serious consequences which I am convinced will arise owing to the inability of the Bahrain Government to supply power to important consumers at the time, their planning demands it, I respectfully request that this my considered opinion on the situation may be placed on record.

Uenoranaum; - , The present inefficient mechanical condition of the three M.B.&amp;D* engines which drive the Generating Debs at the GoverniiBnt power Station and their increasing liacility to fcseaK- down is causing me much anxiety. Despite all my efforts^to effect improvement by better maintenance and oil iiltrcioion, ^he hot weather loads call for an output which is beyond This state of affairs is all the more distrubmg fact that we have to make temporary shut downs of the load even when the R # A.B* i£ off or supply present our capacity, in view of the certain feeders to .se The maximum peak load recorded last year was 305 h..&lt;# and it is confidently anticipated that this will be consiaerably increased during the next two months. To date, the.average maximum peak load recorded has been 308 K.J. and we have been^unable to carry *h this O'wing to the poor mechanical condition oi the engines. The total maximum rated output of the three sets now ^ ^ _ in aservice is 400 K*W. If they had been maintained in good condition^ they would be capable of continuous running for at least 18 ^ous daily at 9/lOths full power which would provide an output oi 5oU K... The maximum load which can be carried continuously is aoO r.w. The combined efficiency of the 3 sets is therefore on_y 6^. 5j. of the Hated Output and 69.4^ of continuous running output (9/10ths full power). t anv moment our load may be increased by extra demands from B.O.iUC., H.N.Base Jufair and H.^.F.

This work was commenced during the third week of April but ceased on the 5yh of June and has not been re-commended to date. As the arrangements made by youself through Hutchings for the manufacture of three roof trusses by carpenters in the Technical School failed to materialise, prepared the necessary design and drawings and made them in my Department and they are awating erection. In view of the srious consequences which may result from our inability to supihLy even normal power demands, and the delay which has arisen in the provision of additional power for the R.N,, B.O.A.C. and RAF emergency commitments, I would like this report to be placed on record.

(2) ' ,/h&amp;t is the position regarding Mr. Mellick’s retention assuming that* (a) Mr. Jaffar shortly returns? (b) Mr. laffar do€s not return?

Memorandum;- TWO MACLAREN/BRUSH 55 KW GENERATING SETS . The above plant has arrived at Sitra and arrangements have been made with BAPCO to collect at Sitra Pier and trans port it to the Power House Site in Manamah. In view of my imminent departure from Bahrain on termination of my contract, I am no longer prepared to carry out the erection of any new plant, as such work is not covered by the terms of my contract. Since November, 1944, I have carried out the supervision of the erection of the following plant: One 206 kW Generating set One 300 kW Generating Set Oil Filtration Plant One 10 Ton/24 hours water distillation plant (in hand) Also I have technically supervised the operation,^ maintenance and repair of the distillation plant in the Naval Base, Jufair. For all of the above work I have not received any additional remuneration. In the case of No.5 generating set, I carried out the complete work, including the excavations and casting of the foundation bed of approximately 153 tons weight without any outside help or expense to the Bahrain Government. Furthermore, I had the plant in-service within 97 days of its receipt at Manamah Pier. This entailed long hours of work under difficult conditions owing to the non-availability of essential plant. I should be very sorry to see any delay in putting the urgently required generating plant into service, and I am therefore willing to continue with the work if you are agreeable to grant me an additional payment of Rs.500/- monthly. Will you please notify me early of your decision and also the effective date of the handing over my responsibilities as State Engineer. You will no doubt appreciate that I shall have a lot of preparations to make such as packing of personal belongings and arranging for its shipment to U.K. after handing over my work. (SGD) H.P.G.

The Political Agent asked the State Engineer to inform him of any instance in which he considered that he was not receiving the support from the Bahrain Government which his work demanded (this was in view of the allegations of the State Engineer that there have been such instances in the past). 4. The Adviser agreed to reply to the State Engineer’s memorandum on the basis of the conclusions reached at this meeting. 5. The State Engineer'pointed out that his contract really ended in September, 1948, but that he was willing to-emain on the same terms (plus the increase referred to above) until the beginning of November.6 „ r ''1 # / - 2 - The likelihood of it being necessary to employ a special engineer actually to instal No.6 engine was mentioned by the Political Agent. 7. TheState Engineer stated and showed two letters to support his statement that he had asked for an increase of dearness allowance from 7i% to 25% in 1945 and said that the Adviser had not. replied to his request. The Adviser showed the Political Agent a letter which he had written to him (the Political Agent) stating that at that time he did not agree to the State Engineer’s request for an increase in his dearness allowance. The Political Agent inquired why the State Engineer did not bring forth his request regarding his dearness allowance under his first contract at the time when his second contract was being renewed. The State Engineer said that he had not adverted to the matter at that time. He said that as a result of his request for his dearness allowance, which he understood would be met, being turned down, he was a loser to the extent of over £300/-. The Adviser adhered to his position that he could not meet the request and the Political Agent was of the opinion that it was now far too late to re-open the matter and to reconsider it.

We enclose herewith in duplicate the particulars of two candidates who have come forward for this post - Mr. Michael Burke and Mr. J.L.W. Cole. They have been interviewed by Messrs.

They have also both been certified as medically fit for service in Bahrain^by their doctors. Judging by appearances, Mr. Burke is a Eurasian. He has the advantage of being under 40, and unmarried. We have seen them both here and consider that personally Mr. Burke is the most suitable of the two. We are now taking up references for both candidates and will telegraph the result to you.

I cannot guarantee the completion of any of this work by any specified date. I have every reason to think that the two Maclaren/ Brush sets will be completed and in service in one months time.

Para 7:- It should be stated that I submitted an alternative request for an equivalent increase of Rs.175/- monthly to my basic salary in case my request for an increase in dearness allowance raised a question of precedent. Also, that I have not received any official acknowledgement of my request from either the Political Agent or the Adviser. (1) work to be done (2) conditions required #Confidential. D.O. Adviserate, July 17, 1948. S k&gt; With reference to your D.O. No. C/L-75 dated 12th July 1948, I agree that your minute represents the gist of the discussion which is referred to in your letter. 2. Since receiving your letter I have had a copy of Leigh f s memorandum addressed to you dated 16th • This letter puts rather a different comnlexion on the matter. In view of para 5 of Leigh f s memorandum I think it is undesirable that he should be pressed to remain after 18th September and therefore I send^^: a draft Agreement for your approval to be sent to Brammer, if you agree I will write to him asking whether he could come here in the middle of September. 3. Regarding the payment of Rs.500 per month, in your minutes this payment is in consideration of Leigh carrying out three specified jobs, installing two engines, completing the distilling plant and removing two old engines and casting a bed. He now says that he cannot guarantee to complete any of this work by a definite date. The position is unsatisfactory but though I am rather reluctant to pay the extra Rs.500/-, with no assurance that the work will be completed, I think under the circumstances it will have to be paid. I am not writing to him, regarding the terras, until I hear from you. v 0. J. Felly, Esquire, O.B.E., H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. ^oaiidential. BAH RUN RECEIPT.

It is a little unsatisfactory that as regards paragraph 1 of the f, Minutes of the meeting” you should not. be able to give a definite undertaking in return for the Bahrain Governments willingness to pay you a definite extra sum; but,In the circumstances of work in Bahrain, I understand why you have to be cautious about making any promises. As regards paragraph 6, you are, of course, perfectly entitled to change your mind about staying on until November and I am referring this point to Belgrave. As regards paragraph 7, I do not think I have any record of your alternative request for an increase of Rs.!75/~ monthly and I do not remember that you mentioned it at the meeting. However I am also referring this to Belgrave. The same consideration seems to apply to this alternative request as to the original one for the increase of dearness allowance viz. the matter is nearly three years old and since you yourself dropped it,and more particularly did not bring it up at the time your second contract/being renewed, it is unreasonable to expect that it should be re-opened at the end of your time. dated the 22nd July, 1948, that one of the new 65 k.w. sets has been installed and is running.

You can, of course, sa 2 r, if you wish, that you are informing him after consultation with me. You might also say that you note he will, in consideration of the payment of Rs.500/- per month (which is being paid without prejudice to the terms of his contract and is NOT to be construed as in any way admitting that he is due anything in respect of ANY previous work carried out by him), do his utmost to complete the maximum possible amount of work detailed in clauses 2 and 3 of paragraph 1 of 'the minutes of the meeting'; he will also be expected to instal the two McLaren/Brush 55 k.w. sets. To this also you may say that I agree. 4.

From POLITICAL AGENT, BAHRAIN, To POLITICAL RESIDENT, BAHRAIN. NolC/R-138. Dated 4th August, 1948. Group Captain Leigh's contract as State Engineer terminates in September and the Bahrain Government does not wish to renew it although Leigh himself will be glad to stay on. 2. As previous correspondence will show and as the Political Resident is aware, there should be no question of extending Leigh's contract. He is now 57 years of age, and although most industrious and active, he has by no means been wholly successful here. 3. As agreed to by us (vide correspondence ending with Sir Rupert Hay's D.0.No.2117-S, dated the 4th December, 1947), Belgrave has been looking for a re placement. In addition to the firms mentioned in Belgrave's D.0.NO.20/395F, dated the 16th November, 1947 (copy forwarded to the Residency with my D.O. No.C/1152, dated the 1st December, 1947), he asked Holloway Bros, to advertise for an Engineer. In re ply to this advertisement, Brammer asked for the de tails of the appointment. He is at present employed by P.C.L. and the Company's Manager here was accordingly informed and arranged for Brammer to see Belgrave and myself. Papers concerning him and showing his quali fications etc. are enclosed (return requested). Belgrave thiaks he will do,so far he can judge from the brief interview, and I agree with him. 4. I enclose a draft of the contract to be offered to Brammer for your approval. It is on the lines of that under which Leigh was engaged, and I have only the following comments: (a) Paragraph 1: More detailed specification of the work involved is considered necessary as Leigh, having installed the new generators, then argued that he was not bound to do so under the terms of his contract. (b) Paragraph 5: Rs.20Q/- per month seems a bit small as an allowance in lieu of free accom- MGdation and I will take this up with Belgrave. 5. Early approval will be appreciated as Brammer feels that his present position is somewhat invidious and also vaunts to go to England for a while before returning here to take over from Leigh.

Dear Leigh, Please refer to the correspondence ending with my D.O.No.C/L-96, dated the 28th July, 1948. on the 6th September, 1946, in which he told me that you had asked for an increase in the Dearness Allowance and that he told you that he f ’did not agree* 1 with your con tention that the allowance should be increased. The letter was purely and simply sent to me for information and I filed it. Belgrave has now confirmed that in the letter in which you asked for a Dearness Allowance, you had suggested as an alternative a raise in pay of Pa. 176/- per month. He adds that f, neither the higher allowance nor the raise in basic pay were granted at the time nor was the question raised when Leigh was subsequently given a new contract, with an increase of pay, therefore I am not prepared to reconsider this claim.** 3.

I presume that Mr. Brammer's qualifications have been weighed against those of the people the Foreign Office have found (Messrs Burke and Cole), vide my P.Ls Nos. B/239 of the 19th July and 3/260 of the 27th July 1948, and that the Bahrain Government prefer Mr. Brammer. I should be grateful if you would confirm this as it is essential to be clear that the _ Bahrain Government have the man they want, and not one foisted on them by us. 3. I am not in a position to appreciate Mr. Brammer’s technical qualifications but presume that if he is the electrical engineer to Petroleum Concessions (^atar) Limited, he should be capable of running the Bahrain electric supply and its connected services. I am particularly struck by the report that he is distinctly 'left 1 * in his political views. } do not know exactly what this means, but we do not want a political agitator in the post of State Engineer where one could cause considerable harm. It is possible he may be a member of the Communist party. If he is, he should not be employed. 4. I fail to find a clear recommendation from Petroleum Concessions Limited to guide me. Mr. Skinner says he (Mr. Brammer) is 'solid' and 'discreef.* I do not know what he has to be discreet about and Skinner has failed to give any appreciation of Brammer’s work as their chief electrical engineer in ^atar. Mr. Brammer’s reasons for wishing to leave the Company appear to be a little phoney-. I should have thought that the installation of electrical lay out for Petroleum Concessions Limited in ^atur a big enough job for an electrical engineer without any particularly - so far as I can see - high qualifications. A sensible man surely could not expect to design at ^atar the electrical lay out. Brammer cannot even be in possession of the Company’s full project. 5. I have not met Brammer and my sceptical attitude may be quite wrong. I certainly do not wish to lose a good engineer for the State if you and the Bahrain Government think he is such. 6. I should be grateful if you Y/ould take the earliest opportunity of discussing the case with me after you have considered the above points.

With further reference to your letter of the 22nd December last, I am afraid I have not been very successful in finding you an Electrical Engineer: (l) There is a Mr. Brammer, who is at present with the Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., and who from all reports is a first-class electrical engineer. I heard that he was intending to resign from Qatar and, if he did, 1 believe it would be worth your while seeing him. You might have a word with Mr. Skinner about him. It is only if he is resigning^ from Qatar that you should consider him, as I should not like to be a party to the enticement of any of the Qatar stall, but Skinner will advise you of the position. I enclose his papers. (2) I enclose papers of a Mr. C. R. Taylor. He might suit you. He is going to Quaite this week for one of ^ the oil companies, and I have given him a letter of introduction to you, as he expects to be in Bahrain and you might see him. (3) I enclose papers of a Mr. W. M. Rcchard. When you have read these over and if you think he might suit, I can see him again and obtain any further information you require. (4) I enclose papers of a Mr. C. J. Smyth, and the same remarks apply as for (3). Sorry I have not been able to help more effectively, and of them all I think C. J. Smyth, No. 4 above, is themost likely. I believe however that Mr. Brammer is quite a possibility, ano. 1 think you should follow this up. Please let me know if you want me to do anything more. You may have to see people yourself when you are again in London.

Mr. Brammer served under me vdth the Electricity Company of Macclesfield Ltd: as Assistant Mains Engineer and with the Porthcawl Electricity Company Ltd: as Assistant Engineer and during that time I found him to be industerous and capable of carrying out the duties of his office. 1 have no record now of his techinical training as the Holding Company The Electric Development and Securities Trust Ltd: (E. D.A.S.T.) has ceased to exist due to the nationalization of the Electrical Industry in Great Britain and having retired from the post of General Manager to that Company 1 have no records of my late staff. I He came to me untrained as a youth ahd proved himself to be adaptable to training. I believe his politics are distinctly 'left** which may have some bearing on the appointment. The Macclesfield Company was a generating Company distributing both D C and A C whilst the Porthcawl Company was a non generating Company distributing A C only. In both cases distribution was by underground and overhead mains. Yours faithfully.[ D .O.HO.P/l/48 STATS EHG-IKEER 1 S DEPT BAHRAIN.

Dear Leigh, I was so sorry that you could not see me before you went away as I would have liked not only to say * good-bye’ but to say how much I appreciated all you have done for the Bahrain Electricity Supply Department in the four years daring which you have been here. You realised, I think, that the presence of continued difficulties is inclined to make a non-expert in these matters doubtful as to whether the experts are handling t! em properly. Whatever doubts T might have had in your case were dispelled completely by Clear’s tribute to your work. There was, X need hardly say, never any doubt as to your industry, keenness, and self-sacrifice while Clear’s judgement established that wherever the fault lay for the short-comings of the Electricity De partment, they were not due to any lack of knowledge or skill on your part. Please excuse this typed note which is being done in a hurry. I hope things go well with you and perhaps we nay foregather in cooler places and with less contentious matters to discuss than the Bahrain Electricity Supply. All best wishes.

He pointed out that there were only 'two beds' to be left in Group Captain Leigh’s present flat. Mr Brammer also told me that the job he is expected to perform is a very big one and that he Should have an as surance of an European Assistant. He said that free electricity was also customary in these agreements. He asked why no increments were provided for. I am asking Mr. Brammer to come over and see Mr. Belgrave and myself regardi^ these points at 12 o’clock on Saturday the 28th August. Jzu 2i, thy ltd.
