There can be little doubt that Ghulam Haidar is entitled to claim compensation for the damage done to his car; but the question by whom this compensation is to be paid is one of no little difficulty. Legally, we should have a case for putting forward a claim to the Persian Government, on the ground that the car was requisitioned by the Persian military authorities, and -that compensation is therefore due. If our military authorities in Persia requisitioned a Persian car, they would, I understand, be ready to pay compensation. But, in practice, there is not the slightest chance of inducing the Persian Government to pay compensation in this case. They would regard it as adding insult to injury if, after invading Persia and violating her neutrality, we then sent in a bill of this nature. Moreover, it will be remembered that we have ourselves refused point-blank the Persian request that we should pay for the damage to Persian property inflicted,by our troops during the invasion. Our/ | REC*. POi, £ £57) R.T. Peel, Esq., C.B.E., M.C., India Office. 'JNDIA OFFICE Ir Our line has 'been that these questions of war damage must he left to he settled with other questions of reparation in the general settlement at the end of the war. Ghulam Haidar’s claim is, strictly speaking, not one that falls within the category of war damage; hut we can hardly expect the Persians to admit this point. As there seems to he so little chance of inducing the Persian Government to pay, we have sounded the Treasury about their willingness to authorise an ex gratia payment as suggested hy the Legation at Tehran. Unfortunately the Treasury are not willing to sanction any such payment. We therefore wonder v/hether you would he willing to put the case to the Government of India, and ask them whether, in all the circumstances, they could find some means of compensating Ghulam Haidar, perhaps they might he able, to provide him with some second-hand car, to replace the one which he lost during the military operations through no fault of his own. You will notice that, according to the Consul-General at Meshed, the loss of his car has deprived Ghulam Haidar of his means of livelihood. \ 0-vuv&gt; &lt;yt/vv ^ C. IAJ, rv^COPY BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. 19th July, 1942. Sir, I have the honour to forward to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, submitting a petition from a British subject, GHULAM HAIDAR, whose motorcar was forcibly removed by the Persian military authorities during the Allied invasion last year and suffered substantial damage. 2. This is the first case that has come to my notice of a claim for compensation for ’war* damage suffered by a British subject. A number of cases have been referred to me by the •Persian Government where compensation had been claimed by Persian subjects for alleged war damage suffered by them in the areas in which British troops had been carrying on active military operations; the damage to which these claims were related was directly attributed to military operations, for example where houses had been demolished by artillery bombardment. I have taken the line that we can accept no liability, as I understand this to be the policy of His Majesty’s Government. The Persian Government would certainly adopt a similar line if claims were presented to them in respect of damage sustained in the same circumstances by the property of British subjects, and they would doubtless remind us of the refusal of the Allies to insert a provision in the Treaty of Alliance in regard to compensation for damage caused during the period of military operations. 3. The case of GHULAM HAIDAR presents the exceptional feature that the damage in respect of which the claim arose out of his car having been requisitioned by the Persian military authorities, but it would be unwise, as well as useletes, to base a claim against the Persian Government on that fact, since similar allegations might be made against the Allies. While I do not know that the British Army in the course of their advance into Persia requisitioned or forcibly seized private property belonging to Persian subjects, it is well knov/n that the Soviet military authorities took over large numbers of private motor vehicles and never returned them. The Persian Government would certainly use those circumstances as a justification for refusing to meet a claim advanced by either of the Allied Governments for compensation for damage suffered by its nationals based on the requisitioning of property by the Persian Government. (E 6185/1844/34) No&gt;^2 31 (853/2/42 ) 4. If GHULAM HAIDAR is to receive any compensation for the damage that he has suffered as the result of the entry of Allied troops into Persia, it seems to me that it can only be in the form of an ex gratia payment by His Majesty’s Government. 5. \ I shall be grateful for your instructions.

MESHED• 25th June 1942. Sir, 1 I have the honour to forward, herewith, a petition from Ghulam Haidar, motor driver, British subject, whose Pontiac 5 seater touring car, Meshed No. 165, was forcibly removed by the Persian military authorities from the Garage-i- Shisha, Meshed, on the 4th Shahriwar 1520 (26th August 1941) just before the entry of the Russian forces into Meshed. As he v/as unable to trace the whereabouts of the car Ghulam Haidar reported the matter to this Consulate-General and to the Parmandari , Meshed. Enquiries made by the police disclosed that the car had been abandoned by the Iranian military authorities and was lying derelict on the road between Fariman and Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. A police officer deputed to accompany Ghulam Haidar and report the extent of the damage suffered by the car certified that the chassis, body and the cylinder only remained, the remaining removable parts having been removed. This certificate was submitted by Ghulman Haidar with his claim for compensation to the Parmandari, Meshed, but he has failed to get any satisfaction as the local civil authorities state that they are unable to take any action against the military authorities who were responsible for his loss. 2. Some of the missing parts of the car were later traced to a local garage and others were found to have been sold to some Persians in the town. The culprits were arrested and tried by the local court, but Ghulam Haidar has so far not been able to get any compensation for the loss of his- car which/ His Majesty^ ChargS d*Affaires, British Legation, Tehran.V i which was valued at Rials 38,000/*-, nor can he resonahly he expected to find Rials 7,000/- for the purpose of filing a claim in court. ♦ 3. As the car was commandeered by the Iranian military authorities and its loss has deprived the applicant of his means of livelihood, it is hoped that through the good offices of His Majesty^ Minister it may be possible to obtain equitable compensation from the Persian Government.
