The movement of Kuwaitis is the light which broke through Kuwait and shone all over the Arabian Gulf. e see the Kuwaitis iumpimg from their terrible dream and are prepared to fight the battle of their liberty The colonists tried to extinguish such awakening in the Arabian Gulf and succeeded for a time, but the free Arabs of Kuwait discovered the colonists tricks and they immediately revolted. They asked to be granted their freedom as they are no longer able to suffer the servitude in their own country. Traq^overnatot watched this movement of Kuwait with great care and were ready offer their help if required. The free Arabs of Kuwait declared their will and asked Iraq to corae to their help, considering Iraa as the leader of the Arab world. They wish to be annexed to Iraq,as tliev know they belong to Iraq and that Iraq is ready to welcome their brothers. I u ' a r?

As I anticipated King this morning entirely collapsed as soon as I mentioned Kuwait. His Majesty^ very in-coherent explanations were to the effect that he had no intention of attacking Kuwait but wished only to egg on its Ruler to concede liberal institutions. I asked whether His Majesty really imagined Iraq could offer herself as an example at the present time: I had repeatedly warned him of the impropriety of using his private trans mitting set for propaganda of any kind and abuse was aggravated when in view of this qi est ion propaganda was of nature to cause ns annoyance if not embarrassment. I went on to insist that His Majesty should disclose his real reason for sponsoring these attacks. King then said wForeign' influences to which his broadcasts referred were Persian and that both he and his Government were seriously concerned over influx of Persians into Kuwait which they regard as ? endangering Iraqis communications in the event of war. I replied that we could be trusted to look after that ourselves: I added that while his last Government had shown some interest in this question and while I had obtained some information on the subject to communicate to them (your telegram Ho.3 Savihg) present Government had / M'7tf shown no interest in the subject whatever and I had not therefore communicated the information.

He trusts that, if Lord Halifax concurs in the/ ic Under Secretary of State Foreign Office, S.V/.l. i' %the suggestion^ action may be taken as urgently as possible in vie 1 ./ of 1 uhe present strained political situation in Kouei o wii-ich, in part measure at least, appears to be the result of propaganda in Irac against the Sheikh. In a subsequent telegram dated Sfbth February of jhich a copy is enclosed, the Resident has reported that the Iraqi wireless attacks extend also to Bahrein and are causing much concern to the Sheikh and his notables. He suggests, and Lord Zetland agrees, that the representations bhat it is suggested should be made to the Iraq Government should cover also the attacks on Bahrein. The Resident, wit h the support of the Government of India, further suggests that an excellent effect in Iraq and Koueit would result if His Majesty's Government's od ligations for the protection of Koweit, as stated in the letter from the Political Resident to the Sheikh of 3rd November 1914, were reiterated publicly by means of an arranged question in Parliament and subsequent publicity in the Arabic world. Lord Zetland would also support this suggestion and if Lord Halifax agrees would propose that the terms of the question and answer might be concerted depart- mentally. € ^ •Jith reference to the recent telegrams from His Majesty's Minister at Jedda on this subject Lord Zetland assumes that Lord Halifax will agree that Ibn Saud should not be given any encouragement to intervene with the Iraq Government/— « ■ u 3.

I reported in my telegram No. 0/88 of 10th March, 1939, the events on the evening of the 9th and the morning of the 10th, which followed each other quickly, or sometimes were simultaneous, so that even Shaikh Ahmad, when he came to give me the details on the afternoon of the 10th, was not entirely clear ahout all of them. that 2. What stands out is /iraqti propaganda f working on the minds of merchants and. town youths of necessarily limited vision (many of whom have 'been in increasingly poor circum stances , owing to the Saudi Blockad.e and the drop in the pearl market) is mainly responsible for what occurred. L VI . - • L) * v- f 3. ^ As I reported in my telegram No. 0/82 of the 7th March, the Shaikh had. dissolved the second Kuwait Council, which had never functioned as such, on the 7th March. Because the Arabic 'broadcasts from I/^ndon had. had a good effect, the Shaikh seemed to have chosen his moment well; 'but the outgoing Council had t6 hand over to the Shaikh - V ' some/fill (fOiy some papers in their possession and asked for time. These papers, such things as the old Kuwait Constitution, written out 'by themselves, and since superseded, 'both in fact and on paper, a contract for removal of gravel, and another for sand, with some others, they evidently set great store 'by, had 'been sent to Basra for safe keeping. 4 m The Shaikh told me all ahout this, and showed me the list of his new Council, a partly elected and partly nominated one, ahout 3 P.M on the 9th at his country house some miles away from the city. While he was doing so, one of his cousins, the 'black Shaikh, FAHAD 'bin SALIM AS SUB AH, a 'brave and intelligent young man, arrived to report a set- 'back. The State Accountant, a member of the Council, known to his friends as '•the Minister of Finance % refused to hand over his account hooks and was receiving support, and the Council had asked for a few more hours 'before handing over the papers. None of this seemed very serious so far and while I was there the Shaikh sent 'back sensible, if, to my mind, slightly confusedly given, orders. 5. Later in the day, however, a certain MOHAMMAD BIN MUNAIS, a Kuwaiti, a small grain merchant living in Iraq, formerly a water carrier here, who arrived on the 7th,and who some people are convinced was on a mission from the Iraq GrOvernment, so authoritatively did he speak, had encouraged young men to distribute leaflets proclaiming the Subah ruling family deposed from power and calling upon the people to resist them. He addressed a gathering of some of the fftllen Council £ in stirring language on the same lines, and they foolishly applauded him ani declared that they would support him; news of which quickly circulated, and caused excitement which lasted until late at night, incidentally 'being enough to make the new Council hesitate to take office. | 6./-3- &amp; '5 Wsuj.

The 'brilliantly sunny morning of the 10th, however, seemed no day for politics, and I was hardly surprised when the negro Shaikh, FAHAD, came to tell me that things now appeared to 1)6 going 'better. The old Council had in the end promised to hand over their precious papers on the evening of the 10th, their temporary Council chamber had 'been closed, and they would make no more trouble. The Shaikh, he thought, had now decided not to have an elected Council at all. This last, no doubt, was known to others. 8. Meanwhile the Director of Security had rightly proceeded with the arrest of MOHOMMAD bin MUNAI3, which he resisted, being severely cuffed for his trouble. Then, on the way to the prison, this little procession was met by the notorious hot-head and smuggler YUSUF MABZOOK, B &amp; to .^05^'' accompanied by MUHAMMAD AL QITAMI, a follower of the former Council, There was an altercation. MUHAMMAD shot at and missed the Police. YUSIIF put his hand to his revolver and the police fired, mortally wounding al QITAMI, hitting Yusuf in the foot, and a nearby shopkeeper in the posterior. 9. There was of course once more confusion all over the town. The Bedouins rushed to arms shouting M To the Sub ah % H They are attacking the Subah', and Shaikh Ahmad arrived only just in time to prevent an outbreak of firing and the murder of Mohommad al Munais. (In doing so he was hit on the back of the head by a rifle butt). Promise of an immediate trial of Munais staved off the fury of the tribal followers for the moment, but it is hardly surprising that the Subah Judges, maddened by weeks of Iraqi propaganda against them, with the screams of the tribes- men/« ao^ [0 W rioai^, ♦HiOttli J UttolllUi ^iloqio^f, iso f (im!,t 3ilT ,l^a(f|; 10910; 1M1 xiocuoo r® r ^eldiioiJ ri 3 lieJoelsM ,818^0 Oil lid 9^ 9* HOHOH lo » eli id ]gl 9llJ ® eociu'ocs.' cubuh®^ c M 'Af lH/OC e®' 6]#'' . «S f -4. men in their ears, and the general situation as dangerous as it was, shortly announced him a convicted traitor and the sentence as death. The man was publicly shot, and subsequently hung until evening, in the main square, 10. The effect of the execution was to send most people to ground immediately. As the gates were held no one could get away from Kuwait, and after some rather protracted hide and seek, all the •wanted' members of the late Council, five in number were found and placed under arrest. 11# The day ended with Shaikh Ahmad leading a w^r dance in the main square and with any hope of an elected council peacefully aiding him in the administration, gone for a long time, if not for good. 12. His Highness spoke to me on the morning of the 11th of his intention to form an advisory council from his family and the notables.

(Designation)SECTION IV ~ KUWA IT g Reviva l of t I raqi Inte r est in Kuwait Af fair So For some years past f IRAQ has shovm an over- neighbourly interest in the affairs and. internal administration of the Principality of KWAll'^ and 'Iraqi politicians^ including Paistum Haidar at the time of the signing of the 1 1RAQ- IRAN Frontier Treaty,last year, have gently insinuated that KUV /AIT v/as, in reality, an integral part of 'IRAQ and her natural outlet to the Persian Gulf. Press publicity given to the pan-ACabist move ment has encouraged the pan -Arabists in 'IRAQ to focus their attention on all minor incidents in KUWAIT &lt;, BAHRAIN, and even as far afield as SHARJA in which the local populace have endeavoured to obtain redress of parochial grievances by taking the law into their own hands, or requesting the permission of their respective rulers to form small legislative groups to represent their interests 3 These incidents have teen distorted in the local press, and have been duly mirrored as an awakening of 'Arab Nationalism and Brotherhood' in the Gulf, Harmless, benevolent, if slightly greedy and archaic, local Shaikhs have been portrayed as bloody tyrants pandering to British Imperialistic aims 0 This is not altogether^a new phase, for it has been obvious for some years that IRAQ cherished a secret ambition to extend her frontiers to include KUWAIT, and successive governments have been at pains to point out to the British Authorities that KUWAIT was not only being mis-ruled by its Shaikh, but was also a permanent threat to t IRA^ as a centre of the smuggling trade, and a_potential source of supply for illicit arms to the 5 Iraqi tribes,. It was not unexpected, therefore, that the arrival in BAGHDAD at the beginning of February of four Kuwaiti political agitators — Abdullah Sagar, Khalid Abdul Lat'if, Mu h ammsLd aljB ar r aE, and Abdul A^iz al Abdul Wahid — snould have started an outburst in the 'Iraqi press on the subject of KUWAIT and its alleged pitiful plight. Soon after their arrival, these four agitators got in touch with the .mutlianna_ Club, the Hidayat al Islamiyah Society and the editors ox various ultra—nationalist papers© Tney duly related bheir stories of oppression to sympathetic and receptive ears, and scon assumed the position of Kuwa.iti Youth Deleg ace^, t sent^ on a special mission to secure 1 Iraq s bener i'c'ial intervention The local press, especially those of the Nationalist group at Basra , has been full of articles on KUWAIT and_the oppressions suffered by its people© Some oi these articles have been very outspoken, referring to KUWAIT as the 15th Liwa of 'IRAQ, and demanding that it should be annexed by 1 IRAQ in accordance with the expressed wishes of its inhabitants. Up to the end of the month, this campaign was continuing with unabated vigour, and telegrams were being sent from all over bhe coun^ry go the King and the government demanding that IRAQ should inoeivone, use nas also been made of the King's private broadcasting station, presumably with His Majesty s acquiescence, ^ go disoeminaGe further propaganda on these lines, and alrnosL' nightly telegrams or poems are read out which have been received at the Palace and begging His Majesty to hasten to the assistanceic£ of KUWAIT# One such poem^ called 'Kuwait for T Iraq,»' was broadcast from the King's station, and sub sequentIv printed and circulated as a leaflet. • Reports from the south indicate that a number of apparently harmless German travellers have recently evinced a desire to visit KUWAIT; it is only too easy to draw erroneous deductions^ but^ in this instance, Herr Grobba's known association with the Muthana Club and the cordial welcome extended by' the latter to the visiting Kuwaitis forms a subject of speculative interest.COPY.

I am in no doubt this is part of Iraqi campaign to gain greater influence and control over Kuwait otherwise Kuwaitis and British would not be included. ^ also means that cy an arranged delay in Basra police office it would be possible to keep area south of Zobair clear of travellers (potential witnesses of police or other activities).

After discussing nearer matters King and Prime Minister stressed His Majesty's friendly feelings for Shaikh of Kuwait and pressed me to expedite acceptance of overtures ^ P' I mentioned in Ambassador's telegram Ho*60. Having heard tjiem out I said I thought Shaikh would need lot of convincing as to friendly sentiments which His Majesty had told me tnat he entertained towards him and proceeded to protest with as much force as I could command against ?di8gr aceful behaviour of Iraqi police whom I said had evidently been encouraged to commit these outrages by unrestrained and harmful propaganda which had mut. been conducted in this country. King and his Minister expressed astonishment and denied knowledge of these events. His Majesty said tha t he would cause offenders to be punished* I said that was least he could do. Prime Minister observed that these incidents only showed how necessary it was that no time should be lost in despatching an envoy from here to Kuwait and that individual whora they had in mind was well equipped in every way to under take such a mission. He would be able to advise the Shaikh / on— 2«» 11 4 1 on how to administer his country and to convince His Highness that King of Iraq^ sole idea was to render assistance in bringing that backward territory up to date. King then alleged that Shaikh employed Peraiane as police and encouraged Persian Inmugra- tion in order to enable him to control his own people. I denied this and when Prime Minister went on to say how pleased His Majesty would be to send Iraqi polioe at any time to help the Shaikh to keep order. 1 observed that I should have thought that Kuwait 's recent experience of Iraqi police would have been enough. J f ^iHRlon nothing) I could say would shake King and prime Minister from their idea of sending envoy and later of inviting Shaikh to Bagdad to be flattered and decorated. &lt;, again begged me to seek your approval for project. But I^mut^ Shaikh will be discouraged from responding at any rate until he has received apology fo r these three latest violations of his territory. If and when apology has been preferred and Iraqi Sovernment have given proof of good faith by show of cessation of propaganda it will be for consideration whether it aught not be impolitic to discourage despatch of King's messenger of friendship. Possibly if as one hopes his relations with Ibn Saud are shortly to be put on a more regular footing the Shaikh would be in a stronger position than he would seem to be today to object to Iraqi blandishments# H impression left on me by ? proceedings at Palace was that Iraqis are aiming effectively to take over protection of Kuwait while nominally leaving Shaikh and His Majesty's Government in their present position# ' protests from this Embassy regarding propaganda have hitherto had little effect.

I mentioned to him about your high character, nobility and sincerity to the Arabs, and that the Government would surely, in the future, notice that your friendship with them is far better for the public interest than hostility, and that His Highness the -amir was and still is blaming the Iraqi Oovernment for not helping in the settlement of the question of his estates etcetera. After a long talk, His excellency Nuri Pasha was convinced, and said, I have old acquaintance with A1 Subah and I knew nothing of that which happened in Iraq. 7 ' He promised to put a stop to the attacks of the Press and to do his best with His Majesty to stop propaganda by the Broadcast against you. I requested him to write a letter to you which I will present to you so that the misunderstanding may be removed and matters may resume their ordinary course, add he agreed to do so. Meanwhile, news were received alHHltv, the recent incursions and events and, naturally, the situation has become disturbec somehow, bat I leave the matter after that, but ^rent to him and ♦ ^ /to him, 'If you iiave still the swae previous idea with regard to good under s t# and i&amp;g and the r as oval of what took place between the two countries, I aca prepared to ccsaplete this desire, ana that I hoped that His Highness the i.mir would accede to my request# After socie argument, he replied, nio harm, I personally like Al bubah and respect them, and I also wish that there snoulc be friendship between Iraq ana all the -tirab .amirs, but the matter has now taken another form, and I wish to know the inclination of the British policy before I write a letter. ft I, therefore, took leave from him to proceed to Basrah, and told him that I was awaiting his letter.

My dear Brother. I hare already written to you frou Bashdad about the progress of the relations hetvteen the two countries and reoeired your satisfao-tory reply, but the recent events that took place in Kuwait, and later in Iraq, changed the situation. During my last visit to Baghdad, I met the ■iniaters, and particularly His Excellency the Prime Minister, and afterwards I was received by His ilajesty in the presence of His Sxcellency the Prime Minister, I expressed to them your good intentions, your Arab sentiments, and your uesire that there should exist good relations and friendship between tue two countries, and I felt compelled to submit your letter and its enclosure to His Majesty and the Prime Minister with which they were very pleased. All of them revealed kind thoughts towards Your Highness, and that whatever has taken place can now be remedied end improved. They are deciding to depute me to Your Highness, and if you approve, that I should carry e letter from Your Highness to His Majesty containing cordial and brotherly expressions. Hi- will invite you to visit Iraq, and to meet him. when the hostility will disappear between you. and mattere will resume their ordinary course. I have arranged and settled the matter in this manner. My departure to your side will be further delayed for some days, he: many I do not know exactly, but Your Highness will, of course, realise this.

The Shaikh gave me the last dated one this morning and I extracted the other two in succession, later in the day. Saiyid Hamid, it now seems clear, is the •messenger^ from King Ghazi; who is endeavouring to negotiate with the Shaikh hy letter from Basra. 2, As Saiyid Hamid has owned property here for very many years, and has half shares in the Monopoly Transport Company and some other local enterprises, it might 'be difficult for the Shaikh to refuse to receive him, if he insists on coming as a -private visitor', 'but that aspect does not arise at the moment, and the Shaikh has confirmed to me that he will not receive him as a messenger. .

These were - (.a) ''hat is the strength of the alleged pro—lraQ_i feeling in Koweit and how far is it responsible for the recent trouble ? This is partly answered by the Koweit Intelligence oummary for tne period 16th—28th February (copy to Foreign Office with India Office letter p.Z. ^ 744/39 &gt; dated 28th March), in paragraph 2i\. of which it is stated that 'there are in fact a few Koweitis who would like to join Iraq, estimates varying between 10 and 80? their leader being Abdul la as Saqr, a man who owns estates in Iraq, which he is frightened of losing, and who owes the Ruler money'. It seems unlikely that the strength of pro-Iraqi feeling in Koweit is of any consequence or would have given any trouble if it had not been encouraged from Iraq/ M. Lyres, Usq. , Foreign Office.2. Iraci by propaganda against the Sheikh and possibly by other means. { Id ) '.Vhat substance is there in the King's allegation '-v. 1 1 J i ^ (Bagdad telegram 91 ) that the Sheikh employs i^rsian police and encourages Persian emigrants in order to enable him to control his own people ? Houstoun-Boswall denied this, and on our present information we have no reason to doubt that he ''as right. ihere is of course a considerable Persian minority in K owe it about which the previous Iraqi G-overnment made enquiries (cf. Fowle's letter to Meters on of the '12th jar- January, No. 50-S, copy enclosed with India Office letter of the 9th ebruary 9 P* .2. 851/39? and connected correspondence) and tne Iraqis seem to be genuinely (though mistakenly) uneasy on the subject. (c) How can we carry out our obligation to protect Koweit s ^ ou — 106 use ^ ^ Iraq ? The question possibly has reference to Powle's telegrams 158 and 159 (India Office numbers P .21. 1898-9? copy to Foreign Office on 27th March) # f t„w p* regarding the report of an Iraqi scheme to occupy Koweil^ territory up to the ^or ridge* As Fowle says3 aggression on this scale sounds unlikely, and it seems possible that the Sheikh's police might be able to deal, at any rate in the first instance, with an Iraqi incursion on a modest scale. It/\k 1 3. It virould certainly be paradoxical and unfortunate if the rslitical Resident had to call on the Royal Air Force in Irao, with whoa responsibility for the defence of Koweit rests? in order to repel an invasion of Koweit territory 'by Iraqi forces ue will let you have in due course any further comments on these points that we get from Powle.

The Shaikh told me that he had replied that he had turned no one out of Kuwait, those who had left had left of their own free will.
