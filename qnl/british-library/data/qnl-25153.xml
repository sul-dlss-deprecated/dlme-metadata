The Socicte d'Etudes was also to make the larger loan asked for by the Persian Government; but the list of securities available has not so far proved adequate for the largo amount talked of, and for two months no progress has been made. The Outlook in the South. No sooner is disorder abated in one southern town than we hear of it in another. For five months Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh has been ap pointed Governor-General of Fars, but he still remains in Teheran, owing chiefly to his inabilit y to come to an understanding with M. Mornard as to the amount of money he require s. Even 17 he eventually goes to Shiraz, it is too late to hope that he can achieve much. The road is shut, the Persian Government has failed to arrest the assailants of Consul Smart, and ■ Mohammed Ah Kashguli is now breathing forth threats of war against the new Ilkhani of the Kashgais. The Swedish officers have no adequate resources for coping with the situa tion. The Acting-Governor, the Kavam-el- Mulk, thwarts them as much as possible ; re cruiting makes no progress ; and the Treasurer- General has no cash to spare for them. To withdraw the British Consular escort would be to expose it to the risk of an incident similar to that which marked its arrival. It was, in fact, either too small or too large for its pur pose ; too large not to suggest a military demonstration, too small to be immune from considerable risk. It will be conceded that the British Govern ment has shown great patience in dealing with the situation at Shiraz. In October next it will be two years since the British Note which gave the Persian Government three months to put its house in order. The British Govern ment is still waiting patiently for that result. There may be a hope of its attainment, but it i s a dwindling one. It should be realized that the sands are running out.r'' f In any further communication on this subject, please quote no. 51216/12. and address— The Under-Secretary of State.

I am directed hy Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter P.2716 of the 22nd ultimo, regarding the retention of the Indian Cavalry Regiment at Shiraz. I am to state, in reply for the information of the Marquess of Crewe, that in Sir E. Grey's opinion the retention of an inactive and useless force at Shiraz cannot, in the long run, help to preserve British pres tige in Southern Persia. He is accordingly prepared to concur in the view of the Government of India that the regiment should he withdrawn in October, provided that there is then no real danger to life and property. As regards the possibility of re-establishing British prestige in the province of Pars, he is pre pared to take any measures that the Government of India or the local British officials can suggest which will COPY TO INDIA 1 ; 2.. i t;r p t Ah y ! s n h„ 33.... j Che Under Secretary of State, India Office. not i &gt; mSS&amp;tBM(31216/12) not entail an expedition into the interior of the country.

In this connection, I am to state that Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive the views of Lord Crewe and of the Government of India on the proposal contained in Mr. Smart’s Despatch No. 9 Confidential of 23rd May (which forms an enclosure in Sir W. Townley's Despatch No. 134 of 23rd June) to assist the Governor General by lending direct to him monies for the re-establishment of order in Pars. I am.

Foreign Office, August 8, 1912, 12‘30 p.m. A GROUP has been formed for the purchase of the Persian Crown jewels, and we have been approached in the matter. If the Persian Government are desirous of selling it is not for the two Powers to prevent them, but to take the matter in hand and facilitate the transaction on certain conditions. Otherwise the Crown jewels will be sold surreptitiously, and no one will be the gainer. At present matters are moving in a vicious circle. No one will lend money to Persia until her house is in order, and no improvement is possible in the state of the country unless money is forthcoming. The two Powers might arrange for the sale of the jewels, repay themselves for the recent small advances, and lay down conditions for the expenditure of the rest of the money. Please discuss this with M. Sazonof. I am seriously disturbed at the reverse suffered by the gendarmerie near Shiraz, and I am anxious to avoid the necessity of drastic measures.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received August 6, 4T0 p.m.) (No. 441.) R. Tehran, August 6, 1912, 4 p.m. ACTING CONSUL at Shiraz telegraphs that gendarmerie has met with serious reverse at the hands of a marauding band under Soulet-ed-Dowleh, about 500 strong, which had taken up a position commanding Shiraz-Bushire road, which was thereby practically blockaded. Acting consul reports that gendarmerie force was composed of 80 cavalry and 180 infantry, with 1 mountain gun, under two Swedish officers; that greater part of them fled without firing a shot, and were subsequently surrounded by enemy, to whom they surrendered without resistance, losing all their arms. Breech of the gun blew up and was abandoned. Small part of force, with two officers, fought for some time ineffectually, but succeeded in retreating to Shiraz. Major Siefvert, who was in command of expedition, was slightly wounded in stomach. It would appear that original intention was for gendarmerie to move out one stage from Shiraz to Chenar Rahdar, and from there advance against Soulet with a force under Kawam, but that Major Siefvert, without communicating with Kawam, advanced alone in spite of urgent representations not to do so. Actual engagement took place near Diringun. It is much to be feared that this unfortunate incident will have disastrous effects upon gendarmerie scheme in south, and may seriously increase difficulties of the situation for Kawam, who was about to lead expedition against Soulet, who has become bandit. Acting consul reports that local authorities are in sore straits for money, that soldiers are clamouring for their pay, and that movement of the Government forces can only be effective if maintained, and that this cannot be done without money. I am urging Persian Government to send money at once, but Treasury is empty. I heard, too late to take steps to stop it, of the rash forward movement of the gendarmerie officers with green troops against tried tribesmen fighting on their own ground. I fear gendarmerie need no longer be taken into consideration as a factor in the pacification of the south, and it is possible that this disaster may have bad effect upon corps under instruction at Tehran.Sir W.

O 1 O 1 nP 1 -J [July 8.] Section 2, Sir W. Toumley to Sir Edward Grey .— (Received July 8.) (No. 134.) Sir, Tehran, June 23, 1912. I HAVE the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a telegram, dated the 20th June, which I have received from His Majesty’s acting consul at Shiraz, reporting the arrival and sale in that place and among the tribes of Ears of large consignments of cartridges. Mr. Smart states that the principal Persian firms at Shiraz trading in arms and ammunition are well known, they are easily accessible, and he suggests that the Persian Government might take measures against them either by threats or by the application of heavy penalties. Unfortunately the firms in question are, at the same time, agents for important European commercial houses, which, though loud in their complaints of the prevailing insecurity in Southern Persia and the consequent loss of trade, might raise serious objections were their agents interfered with, even though such interference were applied in the interests of trade and security generally. His Majesty’s acting consul-general at Busliire, to whom Mr. Smart repeated his telegram, for his information, suggests that there might be no objection to the local authorities, after previous consultation with His Majesty’s consulate, in the case of British firms, searching the premises implicated for arms, and confiscating all arms in default of proof of payment of duty. _ It appears to me, however, that the confiscation of the arms would serve small purpose unless they were destroyed, and I venture to ask whether it would not be possible to induce the British firms mentioned to cause their agents to desist from this traffic.have ^ q ollour to enclose at the same time copy of an interesting despatch from Mr. Smart, dated the 23rd May, in which he reviews the situation in Ears during the three previous months. . . .. p A perusal of this despatch cannot inspire one with any confidence in the ability ol the Persian Government to restore order within a reasonable period of time to .that disoro-anised province. You will notice that, at the time of writing, Mr Smart reported that there was a great scarcity of cartridges at Shiraz, and that even the tribes weie me y to feel the pinch before long. Mr. Smart adds that any effective measures to prevent ' the import of arms and ammunition would contribute very largely to the restoration of order in the province. This recent large influx of the necessary material for counteracting all the efforts—however weak—of the Central Government to re-establish their authority is therefore still more to be deprecated, and it is much to be regretted that agen s of British firms should be concerned m a trade that is of a nature to do grievous uann in the province, and delay the restoration of order. ^ ia ' e ’ WALTER TOWNLEY. nr* / fa.fcr* rcnETARY'SNCtfn Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

These three Persian firms and above-mentioned British principals are loud in their complaints of prevailing insecurity while lawless elements are being provided \'ith smews of free- booting by these very Persian firms. These Persian firms are accessible, and it ought not to be impossible for Persian Gfovernment by stern menace or actual application of heavy penalties to compel them, provided foreign principals do not raise objections, at any rate to carry on their pernicious trade in more discreet manner. (Addressed Tehran; repeated Bushire.) Enclosure 2 in No 1. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. (No. 9. Confidential.) Sir, ^ _ Shiraz, May 23, 1912. NOW that the tribes have passed Shiraz, and I have a little leisure from the continual distractions of the tribal migration, the time would seem opportune for a review of the situation in Ears during the last three months and of its possibilities for the future. The Kashkai question has of course been the dominant factor in the tribal imbroglio. I have already reported by telegram the details of the typically Persian campaign by which Soulet-ed-Dowleh was ousted from the chieftainship of the Kashkai tribes. Ibis action of the Persian Government has, as I have previously pointed out, come too late to be really effective. Two years ago the dismissal of Soulet-ed-Dowleh might have brought about a general restoration of order in the province. To-day its effect can only be partial and temporary, unless supported by a Government stronger and more stable than that which has misruled Ears for the last few years. Tribal warfare, unsupported by Government force, is generally inconclusive in Persia, and such force is lacking to-day. Soulet-ed-Dowleh may—another Naib Hussein—long roam at large, stirring up disorder, making trouble for the ilkhani, intriguing with any elements among the Kashkais who may at different times he dissatisfied with Sardar Ihtisham s repressive measures or his efforts to collect taxes. Even if Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s natural timidity lead him to make dishonourable submission or to retire to an equally dishonourable exile, Sardar Ihtisham cannot hope, without strong Government support, to control his tribes effectively. r l he chiefs who have helped to place him in power realise now too clearly the weakness of the authorities, and an ilkhani’s control of his tribes has always been dependent on the kalantars’ respect for the Government behind their chieftain. Nevertheless, Sardar Ihtisham’s accession has, for the moment, greatly lessened the more serious dangers of the situation in Ears, audit may, if external influences do not again intervene to prejudice the good work accomplished, contribute towards an amelioration of the state of the province. Ihe condition of the Khamseh tribes is even less encouraging. These mixed elements are at any time much more difficult to manage than the Kashkais, who are less sav age, more chary of revolt owing to their wealth in lands and flocks, more amenable to their chiefs, more homogeneous than the Khamseh tribesmen. The latter are divided by perpetual quarrels, by frequent intertribal hostilities. They are now in a chronic state of insubordination, and, though most of them are, on occasion, ready to fight for Kawam-ul-Mulk, ^ they will at present not respond to his injunctions against their freebooting exploits. Indeed, they plunder Kawam-ul-Mulk’s own estates as thoroughly as those of other landowners. I hey have made the Ispahan postal road impassable, pillaged the more defenceless 'villages in the neighbourhood of that route between Zeighan and Abadeh, and have been cutting our northern telegraph wires with nutating peisistency.^ In Darab, kesa, Niriz, right away to the Kerman border, they liao e almost expropriated the unfortunate landowners. Wandering bands of Arabs, Baseris, and Beharloos, under their own chiefs or brigands like Sheikh Zacharieh, plunder on a large scale in three provinces. Nasr-ed-Dowleh’s administration of the Khamseh tribes has come to an inglorious close, at any rate for the present, with the execution of Eeza Kuh Khan, reported in my telegram No. 59 of the 1st April last. Although this predatory Arab chief richly deserved his fate, his execution was most inopportune in view of the then approaching struggle with Soulet-ed-Dowleh. Kawam-3 his son ’ Ctelrl’ J H ll '- advi ^ d 1 no 1 t . to aoce Pt fait accompli and support that the Khfmti V d f g thlS ^ publicly disowned Nasr-ed-Dowleh, with the result became even mot veco^nag from the salutary fear inspired by this execution, theTovernnr,! /fl!

Though perhaps not possessing great authority, he has °rson era K e e ^P erien 'f of the Khamseh tribes, and he appears to be a reasonable h , ? ,!;. 6 t,l | ,ld me that his mission would probably be confined to soothing the tribes i fair words until the autumn, when it is hoped that Kawam-ul-Mulk may find leisure to undertake in person the necessary repressive measures. ihe state of the mam road from Bushhe to Ispahan is well known to you. The northern section has been closed to caravan traffic since the beginning of March. There has however, been a distinct improvement on the stretch between Abadeh and the spahan frontler. This is perhaps due partly to removal of the incompetent deputy- governor of Abadeh, Midhat-ul-Mulk, and the appointment in his place of Muhammad , / i J' 11 , 1 ^ asilkai ( n °f Mu hammed Ali Khan Kashkuli). This person, who governed . a(be i •h? ar * or Soulet-ed - Do wleh, has adapted himself to the new regime and given satisfaction to the inhabitants of Abadeh by his administration of the district, rrobably, however, the chief cause of the amelioration of the Abadeh-Aminabad section is the absence of caravan traffic to attact Kuhgeloos and other brigands with the hope of substantial booty. A large caravan started up the Sarhad road in the first week of this month, and this route is, in view of the Khamseh depredations on the postal road between Zerghan and Abadeh, likely to be used almost exclusively by caravans during this summer. Caravans have been passing fairly continuously along the §outhem road, which, however, is in a most unsatisfactory state. The blackmail levied by the road-guards and their barefaced pilfering from caravans have reached unprecedented proportions. The attitude of these road-guards, especially at Rahdar, towards European travellers is disgraceful. Apart from being heavily blackmailed, European travellers must expect to be treated with violent discourtesy, even threatened v ith pointed rifles, by these servants of the Kashkuli khans, who are the wardens of this road, this aggravated discourtesy towards Europeans is undoubtedly due to the ^ effect produced among tribesmen by the impunity of the recent attacks on His Majesty’s troops. As reported in my telegram No. 55 of the 24th March last, the Kashkais, largely owing to their feud with the Kazerounis, have diverted the traffic after Kamarij to bhapur, and thence via Naudan to Mian Kotal. Kawam-ul-Mulk is most anxious to secure a reversion to the main road, and he hopes that the settlement of the question of the Kazeroun governorship may contribute towards the accomplishment of this object. Haji Muntesir-ul-Mulk, who was appointed governor in the place of Muhammed Ali Khan Kashkuli more than two months ago, shows no eagerness to set out from Shiraz to assume the difficult governorship of a town whose inhabitants are on very bad terms with their powerful neighbours, the Kashkais. There is some talk of the appointment of Nasir-ed-Diwan as Governor of Kazeroun, of which he is now kalantar. Khurshid Khan, who has a bitter feud with Muhammed Ali Khan and the Kashkulis since the unprovoked attack on Kamarij last year, has just paid a visit to Nasir-ed-Diwan at Kazeroun. There are rumours of a combination between Kamarij and Kazeroun to eject the Kashkais from the Shapur villages, which formerly belonged to Khurshid, and to secure a reversion of the traffic to the main road. Tins road, however, cannot be opened without the consent of the Kashkais, and the more prudent among their adversaries, recognising this, are trying to negotiate for a fiiendly settlement. Natural causes may, however, bring about the reversion to the main road, for the Naudan route is ill supplied with fodder and animal disease is very prevalent on it during the hot weather. Already several large caravans which came up the main road have arrived at Shiraz. There is, however, at present a block of caravans waiting at different points for a settlement of the road controversy. The bad relations existing between the Kashkais and the settled population along the road is productive of much uncert dnty and greatly aggravates the difficulties of traffic. It is w ry possible that the latter, to secure the passage of traffic through their lands, may obtain the acquiescence of the Kashkais for a monetary consideration, which, of course, will in the end be paid bytn6 muleteers in increased ralidari. Alrealy the rates of mule hire are almost prohibitive. . n rr i at n I have been able, owing to the effective assistance ot Kawam-ul-Mulk and the personally friendly attitude°of the Kashkai khans towards the consulate, to pass a few European travellers up and down the road north and south of Shiraz, but the arrano-ements for such journeys involve for me an amount of labour and anxietT which is extremely trying. All my efforts cannot ensure such travellers against violent insults and blackmail on the part of the road-guards. I may mention that, to enable European travellers to pass in relative safety along the Bushire road, I am compelled to entrust them to the chiefs implicated in the attacks on our troops. For instance, Ardeshir Khan, the young Kashkuli chief who, after, as I strongly suspect, having shot me, picked me up on the field of battle and tended me with such genial kindliness (see my telegram Kb. 10 of the 8th January last^ has, m his endeavouis to placate me, twice personally escorted up and down the road European travellers whom I have been compelled to entrust to the care of the Kashkuli khans. Only a saving sense of humour can enable a British agent to maintain his equanimity under such conditions. Away from the main road the province is, in great park my longer even under the nominal control of the Government. Shiraz is mainly a distiibutmg centre foi the outlying districts, especially Fesa, Darab, Bar, as well as for Ispahan and Yezd. Pedlars scarcely ever venture out into the districts, which are closed to all regular trade from Shiraz. The north road, as already indicated, is only fitfully open to caravan traffic. General congestion of stocks and commercial stagnation are the results of this closure of the outlets for Shiraz trade. Order has been satisfactorily maintained in the Shiraz valley for the last six months, and the tri &gt;al migration has happily passed without any incident in connection with our troops. This has been due to the able administration of Kawam-ul-Mulk and the appeasement, through the accession of Sardar Ihtisham, of the strife between the Kashkais and the Kawamis. This strife was aggravated and given an appearance of permanence by Soulet-ed-Dowleh for the purposes of his vindictive hostility against the Kawami family. The results of his eclipse have, I hope, shown that there is no permanent, bitter hostility between that family and the Kashkais or between the latter and the Khamseh tribes/ The Kashkai and the Kawami interests of course clash at times, but the fact that Khamseh and Kashkai tribesmen fought side by side against Soulet-ed-Dowleh and the present friendly, respectful attitude of the Kashkai chiefs towards Kawam-ul-Mulk prove that these interests can be brought into harmony. This harmony, though it may be disturbed again by ill-advised action on the part of the Persian authorities or by other causes, has given us peace in the Shiraz valley during this spring. In the maintenance of this harmony lies the only hope ot salvation through native efforts. Having summarily and moderately described the present unsatisfactory situation in Ears, I venture to offer a few remarks regarding the possibilities of the future, firstly as regards our own position in the province, and secondly as regards the prospects of a tolerable restoration of order by the Persian Government. Our own position in Ears has been radically changed by recent developments. As long as our soldiers in Shiraz were limited to a number which, in Persian eyes, could pass for a consular escort, there was no native animosity against them. As soon, however, as the number of our soldiers here reached the proportions of a military force, the apprehensions of the lawless elements in the province were aroused. Sooner or later these apprehensions were bound to take the form of opposition. This opposition, which manifested itself in the attacks on our troops north and south of Kazeroun, has, in the absence of any attempt at vindication on our part, been very embarrassing to the consulate. Hitherto His Majesty’s consul, when the local authorities failed him, was able by friendly communications with the tribal chiefs to protect his countrymen. It has now become exceedingly difficult for him to cultivate friendly relations with tribesmen who are in manifest opposition to His Majesty’s troops. In fact, his advantageous position of friendly neutrality is jeopardised. The ilkhani and the Kashkai chiefs have shown every desire for friendly relations with me. Sardar Ihtisham, before his departure northwards, sent me a most cordial letter, protesting his friendship, and presents, which I of course courteously refused. I have reported by telegraph the effective measures he took, in reply to my private representations, to protect our southern telegraph wires. Muhammed Ali Khan and the Kashkuli and Farsimadan chiefs made similar protestations and invited me to pay them a visit in their summer quarters. In view of their share in the attacks on His Majesty’s troops, I am unable to respond very heartily to their advances. I cannot, however, in our presentprecarious position, afford to ignore altogether chiefs who control the Bushire roud and might, if they wished, make much trouble for us in the Shiraz valley itself. I continue, therefore, to acknowledge their advances with moderate enthusiasm, laying stress on the fact that my attitude is due to the kindliness with which they treated me personally r %yhen I fell wounded into their hands, and is conditional on the prompt surrender of j the culprits of the attacks on our troops. This compromise cannot last indefinitely, and, when I can no longer keep up the pretence of believing that they will accord us the reparation demanded, I am at a loss to conceive how, without loss of dignity to His Majesty’s Government, I shall be able safely to regulate my relations with the Kashkai chiefs. At present they are all prodigal of promises of satisfaction, alleging that the delay has been due to the critical tribal situation. Muhammed Ali Khan stated that, until the question of Soulet-ed-Dowleh was settled, he could not punish a single shepherd in his tribe. They all declare that the guilty parties have fled to Soulet-ed-Bowleh or elsewhere out of reach for the present, but they are quite unable to explain, except by grotesque excuses, the escape of the culprits who were under arrest in Muhammed Ali Khan’s camp at Shapur when I was his guest there. Even supposing that the chiefs have nothing to fear from awkward revelations, I doubt whether they would now, except under some very real menace, risk alienating the sympathies of their adherents by the surrender of the culprits. I am of course j pressing them in every possible manner, but directly and through Kawam-ul-Mulk. Hitherto the consulate was universally respected by the tribes as the symbol of a Great Power, and its representations were generally received with deference. It is true that its inability, owing to the prevailing anarchy, to obtain satisfaction for the claims of British subjects, the recurrence of unpunished attacks on British travellers, had somewhat diminished the consulate’s authority. Yet His Majestv’s consul still represented an incalculable power, which the tribesmen were reluctant to offend, especially as they had no quarrel with an official whose role was mainly confined to that of an impartial spectator. All this is being changed. Our troops have come and been attacked twice with impunity. His Majesty’s consulate cannot hope to retain long the respect which the tribesmen, vaguely apprehensive of the unknown possibilities of England’s displeasure, still entertained for it. The ignorant tribesman naturally argues that England, dissatisfied with his depredations, has sent a military force to Ears. He has been able to attack that force with impunity, and, as he thinks, with success. He can only attribute our subsequent inaction to impotence or fear. Nasrullah Khan, British vice-consul at Kerman, whose distressful journey to Shiraz I have reported by telegraph, told me that far away on the Kerman border Arabs and Beharloos spoke to him with exultant insolence of the now famous attacks on our troops, and, confident in their own martial superiority, with contempt of the possibility of successful reprisals on our part. I have already reported on the Kashkai attitude in this respect. Muhammed Ali Khan, during the pleasant evenings I spent lying wounded in his tent, displayed a similar though more courteous exultation ; and the most that his vanity would admit was that our troops were perhaps able to meet Persians in the plains. He was convinced of the superiority of his tribesmen in hill warfare. It is evident, therefore, that no solution of the present difficulty other than our rehabilitation by British arms can regain the tribal respect previously entertained for us. If our troops are withdrawn after the exaction by the Persian authorities of adequate reparation from the offending tribe our former position would not be recovered therebv, though w^e could doubtless continue to exist here with some profit to our commercial and political interests. If our ti oops were withdrawn without the exaction of adequate reparation the consulate’s influence would be completely destroyed. British subjects would be exposed to much contemptuous discourtesy on the part of the natives, and would depend for protection on the good-will of the local authorities, who perhaps could be influenced by the Central Government under pressure from His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran. It' is doubtful whether British firms would find much profit in continuing their business under such conditions. It is still more doubtful whether the services I could then render to His Majesty’s Government or British residents would justify the expense of maintaining a consulate here. _ If it is finally decided tffi/t, in order to restore a measure of our former influence here armed intervention is inevitable, it might take the form of a punitive expedition to punish the Kashkulis, with the intention of immediate withdrawal as soon as this specific object was accomplished. 1 do not believe that such an expedition would be difficult even if the Kashkulis were supported by the majority ot the other Kashkai tribes. 'My experience of nomad tribes in Persia, and especially of the Kashkais, does [2545 h —2j ^not lead me to share the view regarding the “ elusive nature ” of such tribes (see Government of India’s telegram of the 29th December last). On the contrary, it would seem that nomad tribes in Persia are very vulnerable. They are. from pasture exigencies, compelled to follow definite lines of migration. By occupying certain passes at the proper season we could hold up the Kashkais, who, unless they decided 0 /'&gt; submission, would have either to attack with a view to forcing a passage or to resign !' fhemelves to the destruction of their flocks from starvation. The trouble would not be in the accomplishment of such punitive measures, but in limiting their scope and eftectmg a speedy withdrawal afterwards. In the course of such an expedition elements other than those we had set out to punish might be drawn into the hostilities We would be assisted hv friendly natives, whom we would, on withdrawal, have to abandon to possible reprisals. Our punitive action would create on the road a state of security, which would be destroyed by premature withdrawal. Merchant classes Jontis!) and Persian, would probably clamour for the retention of our troops, would no doubt discover excellent reasons to support their appeals. British local agents would nnd themselves exceedingly embarrassed to assume the responsibility for recommendino- a withdrawal at any particular moment. I need not enlarge on the obvious difficulties which, as experience has shown elsewhere, would militate against the limitation of such mytary action and the subsequent withdrawal of foreign troops introduced into an soldiers ^ C ° Untr ^’ where B'Mish subjects have to remain after the departure of our Armed intervention might again frankly assume the form of occupation, which would of course be a more arduous and more costly enterprise. It might be possible to huu ei such occupation temporary by the formation of a native gendarmerie under idish officers and the segis of our troops, which would be gradually withdrawn as imniw f ° r &gt;1 !T Cam ? e , fficient - Needless to say, similar difficulties would probably 1 de the w ithdrawal of an occupying army as in the ease of a punitive force. ‘ , lowever. armed intervention is negatived as contrary to our interests our umf r ir 7 h f aVe mf- tay P 0 f ° r a ? ons,dei ' ab| e time.

For instance, it is unlikely that a sensible governor, however much he might rob the public purse, would waste money on a ludicrous force such as that sent, at great expense, by the 1 ersian Government last year to restore order in Ears. We have ^een how cleverly Kawam-ul-Mulk has eked out, for the successful maintenance of order m the bhiraz valley, the insignificant sums received from Tehran this year. The ireasurer-General might appoint a competent European financial agent to control the expenditure of such local loans m a manner similar to that employed by M. Mornard at Tehran. In this manner it might conceivably be possible to build up a local Govern ment which, self-contained and independent of the vicissitudes of an unstable Central Government, could maintain a tolerable measure of order in Ears. At present the only competent local authority at Shiraz is Kawam-ul-Mulk, whose successful and prudent management of the critical situation here has done much to remove the prejudices entertained against him. If the Persian Government are able to send us a suitable Governor-General he would, I think, be well advised to utilise Kawam-ul-Mulk, who, with his unrivalled knowledge of Ears, his power over ^ the ilkhani and the Kashkai chiefs, his influence among the Khamseh tribes and in the province generally, is perhaps the only man who to-day can hope to do anything effective towards the restoration of order. He is essentially a Govern ment man, and he can never go into open rebellion, for his power is bound up with that of the Government. He has, moreover, owing to the damage inflicted on his large vested interests by the anarchy in Ears, everything to gain by a restorat ion of order. I confess that I am sceptical of governors sent from Tehran who endeavour, in the present impotence of the Government, to govern against the Kawami interests. They come and go, but Kawam-ul-Mulk remains, the most stable, the most accessible power amidst the general chaos of the province. I would view w ith apprehension the removal of this last element of stability in the general dissolution of Ears. A local magnate of such power is of course often embarrassing to the Government, but the Persian Government to-day are too weak to stand on their own legs in Ears. They must lean on local support and put up with the inconveniences involved in such dependence. In order to secure Kawam-ul-Mulk’s whole-hearted co-operatimi with a Governor- General, or a more fearless, a more energetic and effective administration of the province by himself, if he is to be left in charge of Ears, some means must be found to tranquil lize his personal apprehensions, his well-founded distrust of his own Government and people, to counteract his discouragement in the face of the prevailing pessimism regarding the future of Ears under Persian administration. It is this personal nervousness, this uncertainty, this discouragement, which impedes the boldness of his present administrative action, and might embarrass him in any future co-operation with a Governor-General. Once he felt that his personal position was secure from the possible malignity of Persian officialdom, and that he was sure of a refuge against the dangers resulting from a final failure to restore order by Persian efforts, he would probably display a much bolder and more effective energy in administering the province, or would co-operate unreservedly with a Governor-General’s administration. As far as I can see, the only way to tranquillise his personal fears would be for us to give him some sort of assurance. We might, for instance, without assuming any definite responsibility for him, assure him that, as long as he co-operated loyally with the Persian Government, he could count on our diplomatic support at Tehran and our moral support locally at Ears. I am quite alive to the possible inconveniences of such assurances to Oriental “ potentates,” subject to varying fortunes, and always more or less untrustworthy. Had I any hope that the Central Government would be able, in the near future, to assert its authority successfully in bars by an independent policy, I would strongly deprecate our supporting any local power in the province. Such support, among other drawbacks, deprives us of the advantages which our traditional policy of neutrality has so often given us. But we are to-day face to face with a grave problem, which cannot be solved by inaction on our part. I would welcome with relief any other practical, less inconvenient, suggestion. Failing any such proposal, I venture to offer the sugges tion, for your consideration, and with full conscience of its inconveniences, that it might be worth our while to support Kawam-ul-Mulk with some such assurances as those indicated above. If, without armed intervention, we wish to secure the punishment of the assailants of His Majesty’s troops and a tolerable measure of order in Ears, we must take some risks. To-day no Persian except Kawam-ul-Mulk has any chance of obtaining the reparation we demand, and he is unlikely to take the serious risks which extreme measures would involve for his own position, without some assur- [2545 h —2] N V f I [; ance of our support. He may of course fail to obtain adequate reparation for us, to restore order in the measure requisite for the withdrawal of our troops. His failure, especially after our partisanship of him, would still further increase the difficulties of our position here. If, however, we do not support Kawam-ul-Mulk, for the furtherance o£-n the two specific aims just mentioned, we must, it would seem, remain inactive spectators^ 1 of the increasing anarchy in Ears, hoping for the unexpected, with our troops immo bilised here under the most unsatisfactory conditions conceivable for a British military force on foreign soil. By giving such assurances to Kawam-ul-Mulk, we could bring great pressure to bear on him, if he began to show signs of indulgence in his notorious obstructive methods. This pressure would be especially useful in the question of the gendarmerie. In the present anarchy this force cannot be a success without the co-operation of the local authorities, who, unless constrained, are sure to be obstructive. They naturally object to the expenditure on such a force of funds which otherwise might contribute to line their own pockets. Apart, moreover, from motives of disappointed greed, the creation of a power under European officers, who claim complete independence of the Provincial Government and reject its jurisdiction, is, even under normal conditions, certain to provoke the opposition of the local authorities. I have already reported on the difficulties continually arising between Major Siefvert and Kawam-ul-Mulk. These difficulties are due partly to the above causes and p irtly to the major’s ignorance of Oriental and local conditions, but they are especially serious owing to Kawam-ul- Mulk’s apprehensions, caused by the imprudent enlistment of his bitterest enemies, that the force is intended to be directed against himself. He frankly told my mirza on one occasion that, if he could be assured of our support, he would not object to the enlist ment of his enemies on a large scale. You are of course aware of Kawam-ul-Mulk’s consistently friendly attitude towards us. Unlike Soulet-ed-Dowleh, whose effusive protestations of friendship were never translated into corresponding acts, Kawam-ul-Mulk has been sparing of words, but eloquent in deeds. I am inclined to think that those who, from outside of Ears, appear to contemplate with equanimity the removal of Kawam-ul-Mulk do not perhaps fully realise what would have been our plight here during the last six months, what it might be in the immediate future, without the cordial and powerful co-operation of this shy, silent man, who, wdth a quite un-Persian lack of effusion, has supported us steadily in the face of nationalist, priestly, and tribal opposition. I need not lay stress on his assistance in facilitating the movements of our troops generally on their wa_y to Shiraz, and the withdrawal from a perilous position at Kazeroun of the detachments attacked by Kashkais, in obviating incidents at Shiraz in connection with our troops, in smoothing away the many petty difficulties which, especially under present con ditions, must continually arise in the relations between our soldiers and the townsmen, in expediting, to the best of his Imited power, the current affairs of the consulate. I no ^ wish to attribute this attitude to disinterested motives, or to overlook Kawam-ul-Mulk s obvious failings. He has little faith in his own Government, and he certainly belie\es ^that a day will come when England will reassert her old position in ars. Doubtless ne hopes that then we will not forget the services he has rendered in mu hour of need. I am also quite aware that Kawam-ul-Mulk, much as he desires a lestoration of order, wants it to be brought about in conformity with his own interests. If he thought that the policy being followed for the restoration of order was contrary to his own interests,^ he would undoubtedly be obstructive again. I only contend that, unless the Central Government have the arms, the man, and the money necessary for an independent policy, they must rely on local instruments, whose interests must obviously e respected. I cannot see where they can find a more serviceable instrument than Kawam-ul-Mulk, who, moreover, has the advantage of being very friendly to us. T ^ no ^ discussed, as a possible solution, the scheme for subsidising the tribes, as gather that it has been abandoned. I have previously ventured to express my rtJ § ,ir d in g this scheme, which seems to me, under present conditions, impracticable anc dangerous. Besides destroying the last vestige of the Government’s authority in t le pro\ ince, it would probably involve us in countless petty feuds, and might before ong lendei occupation on a large scale inevitable. The tribal chiefs are too irresponsible, oo um enable, too inaccessible, to be easily amenable to our dictation, unsupported by armed force. Moreover, the present insolent spirit of the tribes would lender negotiations for such a scheme almost impossible, unless we were prepared to make c lastic tureats, which, in case of necessity, would have to be executed. I understand that on the north-west frontier of India we established systems of subsidisation after ia\ mg pie\ lously defeated the natives in war and inspired them with a salutaryrespect for our power, which, moreover, as they are aware, is ever ready to strike a^ain, it necessary. We are fir from possessing that essential advantage here. 1 have not discussed the question of the prevention of the import of arms and .ammunition into bars, as this is a matter of obvious importance and of more concern ^to His Majesty s consuiate-genera! at Bushire. Any effective preventive measures ot this kind would, of course, powerfully contribute to the re deration of order in Ears. At present there is a great scarcity of cartridges at Shiraz, hut this scarcity has hitherto chiefly embarrassed the Government, which has latterly been compelled to purchase cartridges at the enormous price of 2 krans each. The tribes appear to he still well supplied with ammunition, though even among them complaints are heard of the difficulties now experienced in replenishing their stock. In concluding this lengthy despatch, with apologies for having encroached so far on youi valuable time, I would lay stress on the very speculative nature of any suggestions for, or consideration of the possibilities of, a restoration of order in Ears through native efforts. No one, with much experience of this kaleidoscopic country, can venture to sound the future with any assurance, except on very general lines. The general tendency in Ears has been from bad to worse, and any efforts now made to stem the tide of disorder, without foreign intervention, can only be in the nature of forlorn hopes. In the end, the chances are that we shall have to face the alternative of the occupation or the evacuation of Ears. It is even possible that, if the decision has to be postponed too long, we may not have this choice, and that occupation may by force of circumstances become inevitable. I have, &amp;c. W. A.

In the circumstances, and as an early reply is requested, I venture to olfer my personal opinion with the express proviso that I am not aware how far it will have Sir P. Cox’s concurrence. “I am strongly of opinion that, without the full satisfaction of the ^ i7g demands* made on the Persian Govern ment, the withdrawal of our troops must constitute a crushing and final blow, too obvious to be disguised by any imaginable pretext, to our interests and prestige in Southern Persia involv ing) as it would the abandonment to the unchecked excesses of local ruffians of all European travellers and commercial caravans. In fact, I concur in the opinion expressed by Mr. Smart as to the two alternatives open to us subject only to the following qualification of the term ‘ indefinitely ’. In any case, it would ml, I presume, be contemplated to expose our troops in the height of summer to the severe hardships of a march from Shiraz to Bushire, and that in no case would their withdrawal take place before the autumn. Eurther, the Swedish gendarmerie scheme is, I understand from the telegramJ to the Eoreign Office from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 156, dated 1st March 1912, advertised to begin to come into active operation in six months from the date of the arrival at Shiraz of the officers, «.e., in October next. It may be expected then that one of three things w r ill then occur; first, the scheme will show immediate prospect of reasonably early success; second, it will meet with immediate obstruction or successful resistance and, on the road, the conditions will become worse than ever; thirdly, the Swedish officers will be convinced of the impossibility of beginning to put the scheme into practical effect, and will either relinquish the task or ask for more time. k ‘ In the case of one, our withdrawal would no longer wear quite the same disastrous aspect; in case of two or three, a definitely new situation would have arisen -which would surely necessitate a reconsideration of our whole posi tion and policy in Southern Persia by His Majesty’s Government. “ As regards question of immediate urgency of the construction of barracks, I can only, believing as I do that the chances of success possessed by Swedish scheme are very slight, urge that it is imperative to be prepared for very «XXL] —J 106 probable contingency that next winter will hare to be spent by our troops in Shiraz, and arrangements should be made to construct the necessary quarters. ,r “ Seated to Shiraz and addressed to His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, questkins™” Tehran end8 '” The ab0Ve te!e g rams d ' ial rather with general of fn regards the P? rticiilar question of the presence at Shiraz Of cavalry being rather a source of danger than protection, is as follows presence of a reliable armed force situation of the Consulate at Shiraz cannot hut he strengthened.

The last check on the forces of disorder in Ears would he removed by such an impression. The above, I venture again to emphasize, is purely an expression of my personal opinion, and whether the Resident will agree vith it or not, I am unable to sav. •&gt;PERSIA.

We are both of opinion that it is most undesirable he should come back now, unless it is eventually decided to make use of his services. With the best intentions he could not avoid collecting a crowd of partizans round him, and were he to reside at Ispahan it is improbable that any governor could rule that city except at his direction. It is probable that he is the only man alive to-day who could restore order in the south, should His Majesty’s Government press for his appointment as Governor-General of Ears. Such an appointment would meet with strong opposition from the Bakhtiari element in the Cabinet, but my Russian colleague does not think that the Russian Government would object.[B] PERSIA.

In ririn had 110 0 PP ort ^ nit y as yet of bringing further pressure to bear on the CentiM Government, as the Cabinet crisis referred to in my telegram No ,,5-i of the 31st May has been prolonged by the endeavours made to induce Vossuk- ed-Gowieh to remain in office and by the recalcitrant and vacillating attitude of this With regard to the tribal situation in the south and the struggle between Soulet- 6 1 and n ® W hffihani of the Kashgais, I have the honour to enclose copy of the latest communication, dated the 28th May, I have received on this subject from u : ConSLd Smart, from which it would appear that Soulet’s forces have dwindled to an insignificant number, but that it will be difficult to run him actually to ground. J Though the tribal migration seems to have taken place without the occurrence 01 unfortunate incidents at one^ time anticipated, yet the director of the Indo-European .telegraph Department complains bitterly of the wilful damage inflicted on the lines m the Ears province which occasioned serious interruptions and dislocation in the international traffic. A satisfactory feature of the situation in Ears is reported by Mr. Acting Consul bmart (on the 4th June) in the considerable improvement shown in the attitude of the priests towards the British, and on the occasion of the King’s birthday the Imam Juma of Ears exchanged compliments with myself. This change of attitude is probably l/ 6 ^ e g ram from the Ulema of Nejef, referred to in my telegram No. 354, of which I have the honour to enclose a translation. The Yossuk-ed-Dowleh when last u w s ^ ld affocted to be ignorant of the existence of this telegram of which I had obtained the text in a confidential manner. I have little to report in regard to the progress of the organisation of the gendarmerie under the Swedish officers at Shiraz. The latest news I received, dated the 22nd May, show that friction which had arisen between the Kawam-ul-Mulk and Major Siefert had been largely smoothed away owing to the tactful mediation of Mr. Smart and [2545 a—3] / V \ IsECRETARY't; N . 28 ] 12 JUL1S122 instructions sent at my instance by the Minister of the Interior to the Kawam enjoining sincere co-operation with the Swedes.

Acting Consul Bill to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic.) Bushire, June 8, 1912. ONLY complaints for robbery of Britisfi goods made here has been for robbery of opium of Dixon, worth 40/., stolen at Khwajeh Ibrahim caravanserai by Ali Mohammad Kamareji, outlaw, one of those responsible for attack of last December, but it is believed there has been general pilferage along road from Konar Takhteh; secondly, there are no indications of improvement, on the contrary the condition of the road has been worse than ever for caravans and for European travellers, and for British subjects dangerous. Bank assistant got up as he had large escort from Shiraz, but he states tofangchis took 7 tomans per mule. German merchant about same date was fired on at Diris and threatened up to Tangi Turkan, having to pay 100 tomans. French travellers in April were fired on and had to pay 40 tomans. Another German merchant arrived few days since had to pay 15 tomans and his wife was insulted at Jafferjin. Indian cavalry camp followers and Baluchi camelmen robbed near Yezd some years ago returned two weeks ago and reported robbery under arms at Khwajeh Ibrahim caravanserai, one Mohammadan being accused of being Hindu was made to repeat Mohammadan declaration of faith after being taken to village and detained. Others of party were robbed at Jafferjin. All complained that British prestige had gone in eyes of tofangchis. Thirdly, rahdari illegal exactions have mounted from 15 to 70 krans per mule in April, 1911, and 17 to 95 krans in September, 1911, to 21 and 27 krans in past two months. Tofanghis now e^rt exactions in more than thirty places, and sugar and tea were recently being heavily pilfered. Muleteers complain bitterly. Fourthly, one of worst features since access to power of Kashkuli chiefs has been their auction of stretches of road to highest bidders and manipulation for their own benefit. Bight to fleece and blackmail is now being bought and sold openly. Kashkulis have deflected road to Kadun valley so as to avoid passing through Kazerun. They have entrusted ill-famed caravanserai mentioned to Ali Mohammad who is at enmity with Khan of Kamarej, next stage. Caravans were detained by tribal fighting near Zinian at end of April and beginning of May. Fifthly, in course of last ten weeks only 4,024 mules were recorded during fifty days as entering Bushire and only 1,070 in past eighteen days. This is totally insufficient. Unauthorised Shilf route with its attendant difficulties has also been brought into use again. Hire has now risen to 34 tomans for 770 lbs. from Bushire to Shiraz. Sixthly, caravanserai and Jafierjin village are worst plague spots on road at present, but unbridled licence prevails and armed men growing more truculent as result of non-punishment of offenders in attack on Kazerun plain. (Bepeated to Shiraz and Ispahan.) Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. (No. 93.) (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, June 9, 1912. YOUB telegram No. 97. Main road Shiraz to Ispahan frontier has been closed to caravan traffic during past ten weeks. At beginning of April Kawam managed to get two French travellers from Yezd frontier to Shiraz safely via Dehbid. After much negotiation with Khamseh chiefs and delays and with huge escorts, at some stages amounting to 200 tribal riflemen under four chiefs, we have succeeded in getting Maletta and eighteen fourgons loaded with British and native goods to Abadeh in three weeks. They are now hung up there, governor Abadeh considering necessary huge Kashkuli escort regarding whichI am negotiating. However, for last ten weeks section Abadeh to Ispahan frontier has / been much safer, and Indo-European Telegraph Department inspector was able to go up and down that section inspecting line in safety. Amelioration was probably largely due to brigands deserting road owing to absence of caravans to plunder. Arrival of B^ashgais migrated northwards may keep this section open as they block access of Kuhgelus. Caravans and post, however, use now Sarhad route and are likely to do so until winter, when Khamseb tribes leave main road on southward migration. Bushire road is open to caravans, but in most unsatisfactory state. Ears Government have just informed me that reversion to main road after Kamarij (see my telegram No. 55) has been received, but reports from Kazerun seem to show this announcement premature. Hitherto some caravans to escape ruffianly roadguards, Mohammad Ali Khan’s dependents at Behdar, scene of attack on our troops, make short cut from Kamarij over precipitous pass to Kazerun via Bardun, this track being at present efficiently guarded by Kurshid Khan of Kamarij and Kalantar of Kazerun, but these caravans north of Kazerun are harassed and blackmailed even more excessively than usual by Kashgar roadguards, who hold road north of Kotali Dukhter, for not having gone by Naudan route. Other caravans which come to ftahdar are there deflected at rifle point by Rahdar roadguards to Naudan route, though occasionally they appear to have been allowed to continue by main road on payment of enormous blackmail. Chief j of these Rahdar ruffians is one of culprits wanted for attacks on our troops. Kawam I in spite of assurances to me has not yet been able to seize or even remove him from road. All along road Kashgai guards blackmail and harass muleteers beyond endurance, opening and pilfering from cases. Settled population along road are on bad terms with Kashgais, and Khurshid threatens to recover by force Rahdar and Shapur villages seized by Mohammad Ali Khan last summer after Nizam’s wanton aggression against Khurshid. If Khurshid could recover those places, Kamarij Mian Kotal section would improve. He has appealed to me for support. While strongly counselling moderation to Khurshid and his allies among settled population in order to avoid hostilities, which might temporarily close Bushire road altogether, I am urging Kawam in interests of road to satisfy Khurshid’s just demands, and restrain Kashgais from retaliation. Kawam does not, however, feel strong enough yet to coerce powerful j Mohammad Ali Khan, who is chief cause of evil. Owing to assistance of Kawam, and personally friendly attitude of Kashkuh Khans towards consulate, I have been able to pass five European travellers up and down Bushire road, but only by entrusting them to tribesmen implicated in attacks on our troops, and with much arrangement and anxiety. Two of these travellers were violently insulted and blackmailed by Rahdar ruffians, who pointed rifles at them, and even fired in air to intimidate them. One robbery of six bales British goods just south of Dastarjm, value 18Oh, and three instances of petty thefts have been reported to me since the 1st April. All information regarding frequent interruptions _ of telegraph wires and robberies of Ghulams repairing lines can be obtained from director, Tehran. I see little prospect of general improvement on northern section until winter, reduction of Kffiamseh tribes being at present impossible, and on southern section until arbitrary power of Kashgais over road is moderated. Government of Ears is, in absence of military force, being run with considerable dexterity by tribal combinations. Mohammad Ali Khan and Kashkulis are at present important link in Government tribal combination, and it may be long before Government can dispense with their support, and rearrange Government tribal combination.

Tribe refused to respond, and Ilkhani, having arrived with force, Soulet retreated northwards. Pursuing, Ilkhani caught him up at Duzdkurd, where lighting took place, in which Soulet, as usual, bolted without making serious stand. He managed to double back southwards, and was reported to beagain in Baiza. Two Kashkuli and Farsimedan chiefs, who are stationed permanently in Shiraz, were sent out on the 26th May by Kawam to reconnoitre in Baiza with thirty Farsimedan sowars. They stopped first night at Poozeh Kushan, only 5 miles from town, and during night Soulet unexpectedly appeared with chiefs, say, 200 sowars. Farsimedanis attacked, killing few Souletis and number of horses. Soulet and hk escort scattered and fled in the dark towards, it is supposed, Firuzabad. Ghiefstold m^ that they were so close that they heard Soulet’s voice, beseeching his Kashgai assailants not to fire on him because he had women and children with him, which was probably untrue. r J It is not clear why, if his only object was to escape, southwards, he chose risky course of passing through outskirts of town. It is thought by many that he intended to make dash for consulate. Soulet, unencumbered by flocks, families, &amp;c., is very mobile, and will hardly be caught by incoherent methods of tribal warfare. Probably only a Government force under Government officer in co-operation with tribal allies could, with carefully laid plans and foresight, run him to ground. (Bepeated to Bushire.)

[27778] No - L Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received July 1.) (No. 119. Very Confidential.) Mran) June 18&gt; 1912 . AS I had the honour to inform you in my telegram No. 367 of the 11th instant, the Regent has left for Europe. The moment can hardly he called well-chosen lor His Highness to leave the country, hut his nervous condition was such that^ it is very doubtful if it would have served any good purpose had he remained. It is possible that a complete rest, change of scene, and a course of waters may serve to re-establish His Highness’s health physically and mentally, and that he may acquire sufficient moral encouragement from European statesmen to enable him to return to an ordeal toi which in his present condition he is in no sense fit. _ , The moment is perhaps a suitable one for a review of the present political situation, which is by no means a reassuring one, and offers small hope of an early re-establishment of such a state of affairs in the country as might lead one to anticipate the approach of an era of progress and prosperity. With the departure ot Nasir-ul-Mulk, the head of the State, if unfortunately only a figurative one, has been removed, and the Government of Persia abandoned, at a moment when storm clouds darken the horizon, to a disunited Cabinet composed of men of indifferent calibre, m whom neither the people nor the foreign residents have confidence. _ , rr i • As reported in my despatch No. 108 of the 5th instant, the formation of a Cabinet was announced on the 3rd instant, but no sooner was the termination of the crisis made public than sinister rumours began to circulate that Vossouk-ed-Dowleh was about to resign. These rumours were confirmed three or four days later. ^ W ith his Excellency’s resignation the one man who seemed to understand the genuineness ot Anglo-Russian efforts on Persia’s behalf has disappeared. The late Minister for Foreign Affairs took an intelligent interest in the development of the schemes lor Persian amelioration, by means of a loan destined to provide funds for the realisation of certain much-needed reforms, and by the construction of railways, the work carried out with so much patience and trouble will now have to be recommenced with possibly a less sympathetic Minister. ^ i a ^ It 'is useless to enter in detail into all the reasons that may have led to the resignation of Vossouk-ed-Dowleh, because it is clear that the chief motive for his regrettable determination was hatred of the Bakhtiari element that more than ever controls the present administration. I had the honour to inform you, Sir, m a previous communication that Vossouk-ed-Dowleh told my Russian colleague and me frank y on the 9 3rd May that he had no faith in the stability of a Cabinet presided over by Samsam-es-Sultaneh, the Ilkhani of the Bakhtiari _ He had at first agreed to join the Government, but felt himself unable to carry out his undertaking when he found that, not only his brother, Kawam-es-Sultaneh, but also his friend, Hakim-ul-Mulk, had been eliminated from the combination, and that he would be standing alone to confront a Cabinet committed to the Bakhtiari interests. _ . i -n i There can be small doubt that this feeling of animosity towards the Bakhtiari is general throughout all NTorthern Persia, and probably it exists equally in the eastern and southern districts. Much uneasiness is felt at the fact that this powerful tube, that was barely known in Tehran a few years ago, should have now acquired complete control of the Central Government, whilst a Bakhtiari chief rules at Ispahan as p-overnor-general. Were these half-educated mountaineers capable administrators the danger would be less, but they are not, and it is clear that their mam object m hold in o'office is to amass money to be more or less shared by all the members oi t e tribe 'Envy and hatred of the'Bakhtiari will create an era of intrigue that will not cease until they have been oustedjrommffice. The leader of the opposing faction must be Sipahdar, and he and his ^n&gt;^P on the goodwiH and moral suppo Russia. 12 JuL 19 [2545 a —4] JUL 1912j , sip :ta?h n ... 2 8 n2 We are thus left on the Regent’s departure with a situation that is pregnant with unpleasant surprises. Neither the present Prime Minister nor Sipahdar are men of who oppressed her, but that to-day the luckless inhabitants of this unhappy are ground down under the heel of a regiment of thieves. Open disappointment is expressed at the results of the revolution and the trial of a constitution. There is no Medjliss to represent the people, and the Ministers of State are responsible to no one, and obey no law but the dictates of their own avarice. Disorders are prevalent and corruption of the Central Government is considered. Even the most ardent supporters of a constitutional order of things realise and acknowledge that the country was not ripe for such drastic reform, and that the move ment in that direction has failed. The Medjliss did not succeed in inspiring confidence, and it is noted that nearly all the members of the late Assembly, Avith the exception of the democratic group, have succeeded in securing lucrative positions far superior to the social standing they occupied before. becoming members of Persia’s second Parliament. Still the constitution remains theoretically, and it is very doubtful if any Government would accept the responsibility of making a loan or issuing a railway concession without the consent of a Medjliss, which few people in their hearts desire to see revived, and which, if born again, might easily prove as anti-foreign as its predecessor, despite all efforts to elect what the Regent himself called the other day “ a good Medjliss.” I must confess very regretfully that it seems to me impossible that the present state of affairs can last long. It appears inevitable that the hapless vessel of the State must be cast upon the rocks of chaos at no distant date, unless some quite unforeseen circumstance should arise to supply the guiding hand that is wanting. The people are tired of an effete Government, and would welcome the appearance of a strong ruler, hoAvever much they might realise that such a man would prove a tyrant. Nasir-ul-Mulk has shown himself a weak and coAA T ardly Regent, who has shirked all the responsibilities of his office, and hidden himself behind the fictitious cloak of the constitution. By so doing he has earned no man’s goodwill or affection, but has rather taught all^those with whom he has been brought into official contact to despise and hate him. Such a man can never save Persia, wdrose only hope for salvation lies, m m y opinion, in the strong guiding hand of such a man as the Zil-es-Sultan, supported by the British and Russian Governments. Failing some such arrangement, foresee m the not distant future the reappearance of the ex-Shah, Mohammed Ali iliiza,^ who aa t ouId probably be welcomed Avith outstretched hands by all but the a mtian, and who would find no Yeprim Khan here to oppose him. Salar-ed-Dowleh, Avnose cause at the present moment seems hopelessly lost, could never have inspired the national movement that the sudden reappearance of the late Shah would, I believe, ca iorth, unless, of course, it Avere nipped in the bud bv the knowledge that his progress Avould be stopped by Russian arms. am sorry, Sir, that my views should be so pessimistic, but I am unable to oresee any happier solution to a situation AAdiich is fraught Avith serious danger for e independence of Persia. Quiet will doubtless be maintained in the northern is nets, so long as the people are overawed by the presence of Russian troops, but in e southern and other regions where this restraining influence is not felt, anarchy is ecommg daily more rampant.

It would naturally only be possible for him to I return as a private person, as it would be neither politic nor advisable for the two Governments to impose him on Persia in any official position. Once established in his own country His Imperial Highness, if he preserves a shadow of his former strong personality, would soon collect a powerful body of adherents about him, and would stand forth as the indicated Regent, in the probable event of the resignation of the Nasir-ul-Mulk, who made small concealment during our last interview with him of the repugnance he would have to return to what he described as “ this hell.” In the course of the above-mentioned interview, Nasir-ul-Mulk gave us to understand that he had told Sipahdar and Vossouk-ed-Dowleh that he would not be averse to the formation of a Cabinet after his departure, with the former statesman at its head. It appeared to me that the chief reason why he attached importance to Vossouk-ed-Howleh’s continuance in office was that he looked to him to bring about the Cabinet crisis which should result in the downfall of the Bakhtiari. If such were really his intention, he purposed to bequeath to his country an unhappy legacy. Immediately after the Regent’s departure, Ala-es-Sultan eh, who has now been definitely appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, called upon me and discussed the situation at great length. He expressed his opinion that the present Cabinet should be maintained ‘ in office as the lesser of two evils, partly because the Regent had entrusted it wdth the direction of the Government, and partly because he considered that an effort to dispossess the Bakhtiari faction of the predominant share in the direction of affairs might be attended by the most serious results at the present moment. He foresaw that such action would be keenly resented by the Bakhtiari, which might entail the secession of their dependents from the Government forces at Kermanshah. Such a step v T ould so weaken the strength of Farman Farma that Salar-ed-Dowleh might be resuscitated and regain possession of the town. Ala-es-Sultaneh also called my attention to the grave danger that might result from Sipahdar’s continued residence at Tehran. He should, he said, now proceed without delay to Tabreez and take possession of his post there as Governor-General. Even if he did not lend himself personally to intrigues against the Cabinet, his presence in the town would make him a centre round which the discontented could congregate. This would be a constant cause of anxiety for the Government, more especially as it was known that he had said that it would be quite easy to upset the Bakhtiari by means of a popular demonstration in town. Any movement of such a nature might have the most disastrous results, as once started it would be hard to say where it would stop under present conditions. Motashem-es-Sultaneh, the Minister of the Interior, subsequently called upon me and spoke in very similar terms about Sipahdar. His Excellency w r as more categorical in his statements, and declared that Sipahdar is already the central figure of an intrigue against the present Government. He said that the Government would be very averse to the use of strong measures to repress such a movement, but ho hinted that they might find themselves compelled to take such action, were the intrigues to continue. I have discussed the situation with M. Poklewsky, who agrees that, under the circumstances, the Bakhtiari Government must remain in power for the present, but he appears somewhat averse to pressing Sipahdar to leave for Tabreez. In this view he may be influenced by the fact that he does not like to bring pressure to bring on a personal friend, and also by the knowledge that the Russian Government would really prefer that Sipahdar should not go to Tabreez, and that Samad Khan, Shuja-ed-Dowdeh, should be appointed Governor-General in his place. M. Poklewsky says that he does not believe that Sipahdar’s remaining at Tehran would lend to any disturbances. I have pointed out to him that it may well be so, but that it is in the highest degree desirable that all chance of a popular movement at the present moment should be removed, and that competent persons see a cause for anxiety in Sipahdar’s remaining at Tehran. M. Poklewsky says rightly that the Regent gave it as his opinion that the Sipahdar might stay on for a fortnight after his departure, and I think it is likely that he may urge him to leave when that period of time has expired. I have, &amp;c. W. TOWNLEY. P.S.—In consequence of Russian representations, Sipahdar has decided to leave Tehran. W. T.CONFIDENTIAL. I ' ^ i -='-*rr Sir W.

I am, therefore, of opinion barracks should be proceeded with and cost recovered from Peisian Govern ment on evacuation. They would probably be convenient lor the gendarmerie later on. “ In informing Persian Government as above, I venture to think we should add if, owing to non-arrest of certain named ringleaders, we are unable to withdraw our troops by 1st September, the necessity of keeping open communications with coast will become urgent, and we shall then abandon demand for arrest of ringleaders, and consider measures of our own for keeping the road open until Swedish or other scheme is in course of operation. (Private.) . . As regards Swedish project, I note that it leaves out of all account question of The solution of this problem by negotiations witn neaamen seems ro ue a preliminary sine qua non to the introduction of any gendarmerie scheme on the Bushire-Shiraz road. I do not see how Persian Government are going to settle this question without our help in some practical form. In that case the least formidable, while effectrve measure which I can suggest for consideration would be the occupation of Kaserun plain, moreover [?], besides being the scene of the recent attack, Kaserun is strategically the most advan tageous position on the road, and once established there v T e should be in a strong position both to overawe the offending Kashguhs and villages, and to assist Persian Government to impose a settlement of rahdari difficulty.

This truculent chief has written insolent letters, m which he proposes that ilkhani and Soulet should be reconciled, and dares the English tp come and get the culprits themselves if they can.

Tribe refused to respond, and Ilkhani having arrived with force, Sowlet re treated northwards. Pursuing Ilkhani caught him up at Duzdkurd where fighting took place in which Sowlet, as usual, bolted without making serious stand. He managed to double back southwards and was reported to be again in Baiza: two Kashkuli and Parsimadan chiefs who are stationed perma nently in Shiraz were sent out, 26 th May, by Kawam to reconnoitre in Baiza with fifty Parsimadan sowars. They stopped first night at Poozeh Kushan unly five miles from town, and, during night, Sowlet unexpectedly appeared with chiefs, say 200 sowars. Parsimadau attacked killing few sowletis and number of horses. Sowlet and his escort scattered and fled in the dark towards, it is supposed, Piruzabad. Chiefs told me ihat they were so close that they heard Sowlet’s voice beseeching his Kashgai assailants not to fire on him, because he had women and children with him which was probably untrue. It is not clear why, if his only object was to escape southwards, he chose risky course of passing through outskirts of town. It is thought by many that he intended to make dash for Consulate. SowTet, unencumbered by flocks, families, &amp;c„ is very mobile and will hardly be caught by incoherent methods of tribal warfare.

It is hard to say whether or no Persian Government have made really determined attempts to secure arrest of culprits. In any case they would have been quite incapable of doing so, as the Central Government is ignored in Ears. I had long conversation with Prime Minister yesterday. His Excellency assured me telegram from Nejef clergy had been sent, but added that chief priest of Shiraz is a most undesirable person, whom he promises to banish. He promised that the culprits should be arrested as soon as new Governor-General has taken office, and accused Mornard of being sole cause of delay in his doing so. Colonel Douglas and Smart agree that presence of troops is perhaps of no positive advantage, but that, after what happened, they could not be recalled without such loss of prestige as would destroy all vestige of British influence. They can suggest no alternative terms for the arrest of culprits, and appear to consider troops must remain indefinitely or that His Majesty’s Government must take punitive measures. Bill, in the absence of consul-general, states that, in his opinion, withdrawal of troopsTvithout full satisfaction of the demands made on Persian Government would constitute crushing and final blow, too obvious to be disguised by any imaginable pretext, to our prestige and commercial interests in Southern Persia. He suggests that much will depend upon the success or failure of gendarmerie scheme under Swedish officers, which will perhaps necessitate reconsideration by His Majesty’s Government of our policy in Southern Persia. My views on the question are contained in a despatch already on its way to you before I received your telegram under reply. I would suggest that I be authorised to * inform Persian Government that non-compliance with the conditions made in ‘ Sir G. Barclay’s note has compelled His Majesty’s Government to construct barracks at Shiraz, which they can acquire (provided consul considers such an arrangement feasible) if troops can be withdrawn before the winter, and that, as a further proof of good-will, His Majesty’s Government have consented to await for a reasonable time fulfilment of the assurances given by the Prime Minister that the culprits will be arrested after the arrival at Shiraz of the Governor-General.

Mirza Bagher Khan, landlord of walled garden opposite Consulate occupi ed by 1J squadrons of regiment, was in Europe last year when his brother, under impression that garden was only required temporarily as polo ground, gave us warden on short lease for very low rent of 120 tomans a year. Land lord, on° return to Shiraz last April, asserted his brother had acted without authority and demanded surrender of garden in which he said he wished to build house for himself. Buildings having already been erected we could not evacuate. We offered compensate him for loss he had suffered by low rent, disuse of brick kiln in garden and other claims made by him. After much opposition he agreed to discuss terms In view of above and fact that occupa tion of garden bv troops and erection of buildings useless after their departure would delay development of land, we finally offered exaggerated rent of 50 tomans a month to date from beginning of occupation. He refuses offer and demands 100 tomans a month from renewal this October waiving his claims tor past year. If we only occupy garden six more months, tor which period lease is being arranged, his terms would be pecuniarily more advantage- ous to us than our offer, but if we have to renew lease again His Majesty s Government will lose heavily. He evidently thinks occupation of garden likely to he permanent, hence his astute proposal. Once we pay 100 tomans a month it will he difficult to reduce rent in future. We are in .possession and can refuse his terms without inconvenience locally, hut he talks of complaining to Tehran and London of our occupying his garden against his will.

Such references involve delay and are liable, moreover, to evoke uninformed vetoes, with the result that it is frequently not possible under these circumstances to collect even the little Maliyyat that is obtainable. (2) He asks for a monthly credit of 30,000 tomans to be opened at the Imperial Bank of Persia here, on which he can draw on present ing to the local agent of the Treasurer-General a detailed statement of the expenditure of the amount of the draft in question. The whole amount of Maliyyat collected to be paid into the Imperial Bank of Persia to meet such drafts, the Persian Government making good any shortages. It is hoped by the Governor-General that within a year the monthly shortages will disappear owing to the increase in Maliyyat which will result from the gradual restoration of order. (3) The present force of gendarmerie to be paid regularly by Tehran as well as the increased force that will subsequently be employed! I venture to support the first and third of the above demands. The Treasury, which had long had no receipts from Pars, will be little affected by any irregularity to which acceptance of the first demand may lead. t^egards the second demand, that much of the money will be asted unless there be European control. Even if money is provided success of Governor-General is problematical, and how large such a sLrta^e isTkelv to be I am not m a position to say, nor can I say when it is likely to dLannear but the Governor-General plainly expects us to lend the necessary sum PP The “• oh..rS,.T'ii.

It is the desire of the Governor-General to avoid taking sides, and to support all individuals of all parties who work in loyal co-operation with the Government. He intends to avoid . drastic action during the winter months, organising ini;he meanwhile a force under the Darya Begi to be in readiness for the spring, when it is hoped by the Governor-General that he will be in a position to impose his will on the tribes. He considers it inexpedient to take strong action for the arrest of the culprits in the matter of the attacks on our troops, pending the organisation of the force referred to above. If the execution of the latter is not demanded, he thinks that it would be easier to effect their arrest. I should be glad of your instructions as to whether or not I should acquiesce in the waiving of the execution of the guilty parties.

In connection with the arrival of the Governor-General, it may be con venient if I explained, for your information, the present position here with regard to the road question, from the point of view of commerce, mostly British, in case Smart is in process of discussion of it with Mukhber. The primary urgency is that the present prohibitive rates of mule-hire and “ rahdari ”, and the outrageous blackmail and violence of tofangchis should be remedied or circumvented without delay. Hitherto it has always been our policy here to press for adherence to the telegraph route, but at present juncture an unusual element of difficulty is presented by the prevalence of active hostilities between the adherents of the permanent headmen on the section from Borasjun to Konar Takhteh, which is equally difficult of control both from Bushire and Shiraz alike. Telegram P. It results from the above that there is a strong feeling locally among traders that the only remedy is a diversion via Jireh or Firuzabad. Some arrangement with the Sowlet will of necessity be involved by such a diversion. In the past such diversions have generally been engineered to serve the purposes of interested parties, but if, in the present case, it were pressed for by the mercantile community in the interests of trade, and favoured by the Gov ernor-General, I would support it, pending the establishment of effective arrangements for the telegraph route.

I have received a communication from the Persian Government complain ing of your action in controlling Kawam-ul-Mulk in the expenditure of the advance of 25,000 tomans sent from Tehran. They claim that, as they have to pay interest on this money, it belongs to them. Doubtless Kawam-ul-Mulk has complained to the Persian Government. In reply, I stated that the object of your action, which I entirely approved, was to afford the Persian Govern ment a sefeguard against their friends who might endeavour to pilfer the money. The Persian Eoreign Office have now addressed me a further communica tion, in which they state that the Agent of the Treasurer-General at Shiraz will be given orders of a very strict nature, and they express the hope that the Agent will now be given full power over the money.I101 According to another statement, you made a declaration to the effect that no troops who did not seek refuge at the Consulate would receive any of their arrears of pay. This declaration, it is asserted, affords an indirect incitement to the troops to behave in an incorrect manner. Please make no further attempt to control the money which has been sent from Tehran, and decline to offer any further advice which Kawam-ul-Mulk may ask of you. { Of course, the story detailed in the preceding paragraph is one of the usual Persian inventions. Enclosure No. 2. Telegram P., No. 147, dated the 2nd September 1912. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Of the 25,000 tomans, five thousand tomans were divided among the Artillery, who were not in refuge at the Consulate, and the Malayir and Eerejegin regiments. The former’s services were needed for the present expedition, and the latter (the two regiments) were in the sorest distress. It was impossible to spare more money to give to the other troops. These are local men and are not in such a plight as the two regiments mentioned above. However, I made strong representations to the local authorities with a view to accelerating the collection of the “ havalehs ” issued on the local revenue for the object of paying the local troops from the proceeds. It is probable that the Military Accountant, who made unsuccessful attempts to appropriate the money, was the author of the story told to you. A payment of 12,000 tomans was made to Kawam-ul-Mulk on the 27th ultimo. I asked the Finance Agent to delay this payment until that date, because I knew that the expedition could not start without Muhammad Khan, Kashkuli, who only arrived at Shiraz on 26th August. As a matter of fact, the army only moved out to-day to Poozeh Kushan, a few miles from town. If the bait provided by deferring further payments no longer exists, the army will probably not bestir itself very strenuously. J The Finance Agent will be informed by me that, as regards the question of the payment of the remainder of the 25,000 tomans, he will i*&gt;w have to exercise his own discretion. / * \ r T * A Enclosure No. 3.

Most unsatisfactory feature of situation is that Muhammad Ali for moment appears to have recovered ground he bad been losing during summer. This is second Ilkhani he has undone, and he is with some justification posing as a King-maker. Fortnight ago Sardar Ihtisham informed me that, unless he assured Muhammad Ali question of culprits would be dropped, that chief would go against him and asked me to waive demand for their surrender.

ONE IDE N TIAL. [September 23. j Section 8. [39809] No. 1. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 23.) (No. 167.) ^ Tehran, August 19, 1912. AS I had the honour to inform you in my telegram No. 4G3 of to-days date, I had a long conversation on Saturday with Mukhber-es-Sultaneh, who has now been encamped for more than a fortnight outside Tehran, awaiting the completion of tie financial, military, and other arrangements necessary before he can stait on hisjoumey ? to Shiraz. I w’-as much more favourably impressed by his Excellency than had oeen | the case on previous occasions. He seemed to have thrown off the reserve and hesitation which marked our former interviews, and to have acquired the dignity and firmness becoming a man about to assume the direction of one of Persia s most troubled provinces. His Excellency laid before me the entire situation as he saw it with engaging frankness. It was evident that he has not only been at considerable pains to study the intricate network of tribal and family intrigues that make the post an especially difficult one, but that he has formed some very decided opinions upon the leading nersonages in the drama, and has already made up his mind how to play his cards. It was soon evident that he not only distrusts Kawam-ul-Mulk, but that he | attributes much of the present disorder to his machinations. He said that he had been in telegraphic communication with Kawam, and had learned lorn nn a e desired to leave Ears as soon as possible after his arrival, and would either go to Europe or accept a post of governor elsewhere in Persia. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh added that le quite thought that Kawam would be ready to leave Ears after his arrival, but t a he would still put every possible obstacle in the way of his reaching ua'z, an vou c contrive to make the position for him there as uncomfortable as_ possible. He said that he considered that it was essential to the success of his^ mission that Kawam should leave Ears, because he could then tell his acknowledged rival, Soulet-ed-Dov leh, that he must now keep quiet and behave himself. There could e no peace, e c ec arec , in Ears as long as Kawam-ul-Mulk and Soulet-ed-Dowleh were both in the province. It was clear from the drift of his arguments that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh at ie favours the cause of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, a fact that may seriously prejudice the success of his governorship should it come to the knowledge of Kawam that such is the case, as he would under those circumstances move heaven and earth to upset him. fills Excellency represented that Soulet must always remain the de /acto head o± the Kashgai tribe, despite the efforts made to supplant him m that P 0Sltl ^ b y ^ DI | sent brother, Sardar Ehtesham, Ilkhani of the tribe. He reminded me t^t the present llkhani’s mother was not of noble birth—a fact that nqitself ma e nSi JL i t for him to have the same authority in the tribe as is enjoyed by his half-brother Soulet, who is the son of a Kashgai lady of nolle buth. __ . . , p • i r* Mukhber-es-Sultaneh told me that he had been m coir,mumcatmn with friends of Soulet in Tehran, although he had not been in actual relations with any of his ofhcial agents and that he had sent him a message to say that he had een e at mg y, aid must change his ways. His Excellency stated that he did not for a moment believe that Soulet had been in any way connected with the marauding band ag i which the gendarmerie came to. grief on the 5th August, thoug 1 e be Quite ll Hulk’s book to represent that such was the case. He considered Soulet to be quite MtcViold me thabcircumstances had enabled him to enter into excellent speedily melt away as soon' as the g y-mr himselt^rrives larg ; P p XS n fo ir^llyat’ his rapaciou/administration. 12619 z—S] an•2 Mukhber-es-Sultaneh also believes that a large number of influential people in the province who have of late remained in the background will come foiward and ia y o the governor as soon as he enters the territory of Fars. The fact that Mukhber is not an admirer of Kawam-ul-Mulk has evidently comar to the knowledge of the Bakhtiari chiefs, who are supporters ot the acting governor because their blind leader, Sardar Assad, who appointed Mukhber-es-Sultaneh to the post of Governor-General of Fars when he was Minister of the Interior, has veered round from an enthusiastic supporter to a somewhat acrimonious critic. His Majesty s acting consul at Shiraz is of opinion that the new Governor-General may find his task an impossible one if he systematically hostilises Kawam’s party, ibis his Excellency assured me was not his intention, although he feels that the province of Fars is not big enough to hold Kawam-ul-Mulk, Soulet-ed-Dowleh, and a governor at the same time, unless the latter puts himself entirely in the hands of one or other of the two rival factions—a position of subserviency that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh will not accept. Ihe situation is an interesting and difficult one. It appears to me that real success can only be attained if the Governor-General proves himself man enough to impose his authority on both factions. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh said that the colonel of the gendarmerie had himself suggested sending an escort of his men, under a Swedish officer, to accompany him to the frontier of the province, where they were to be met by an escort of the Shiraz section of the force. There appeared, however, a disinclination to carry out this programme since the gendarmerie reverse at Diringun. He expressed great hope that the gendarmerie would not be influenced by this unfortunate incident, because there was nothing to fear, and it might give the force some prestige to accompany the Governor-General, whilst the fact that he was escorted to Shiraz by a gendarmerie detachment would not only re-establish the force in public estimation, but would afford the occasion of a public demonstration that the governor means to support the new gendarmerie scheme. Since writing the above I have ascertained that a detachment of gendarmes is to accompany Mukhber-es-Sultaneh, at least as far as Ispahan. The moment seemed to me a favourable one to ascertain the views of the Governor- General upon the proposed withdrawal of the small detachment of British-Indian troops established at Ispahan and Shiraz. I accordingly told Mukhber-es-Sultaneh confidentially that His Majesty’s Government were considering the advisability of withdrawing the troops in question in the autumn, and I asked his Excellency whether he thought such a move might seriously affect British prestige in the province, and even tend to weaken the position of the Governor-General. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh replied that the question had received his most serious attention, and that he had come to the conclusion that the most desirable course to pursue would be for His Majesty’s Government to first withdraw the detachment at Ispahan to Shiraz. When this had been done, he would represent to the mollahs and leading personages of the province that it was clear that the British Government were genuinely determined to withdraw their troops. He would then make them understand that it was a disgrace to the province that foreign troops on a peaceful mission and a foreign consul had been wantonly attacked. He would show them that they ought to be ashamed that such an outrage had occurred in their territory, and would urge upon them that reparation should be made by handing over the culprits. His Excellency appeared confident that he could secure this end, more especially if it was understood that His Majesty’s Government would not demand the execution of the culprits, and if Mohammed Ali Khan, Kashkuli, was not included among the culprits. He pointed out that Mohammed Ali Khan was not personally present at the moment of the attack, and that he had not only put a stop to the firing on his arrival, but had rendered personal assistance to Mr. Smart when wounded. He added that Mohammed Ali Khan was so alarmed at the punishment he feared that he was becoming a reckless bandit. I replied that I was not aware of the intentions of His Majesty’s Government towards the culprits, when surrendered, but I hardly supposed that the full penalty of the law, even for such an abominable outrage, would be exacted, neither did I know if the name of Mohammed Ali Khan was included amongst those held to be actual culprits but I did know that he had earned great resentment from the fact that it was felt that he has all aJong been in a position to know and surrender the true culprits, and has not done so. r Mukhber-es-Sultaneh appeared to deprecate the idea of the withdrawal of the roops until reparation had been made, and even hinted that he would not guarantee3 yto ncy il * their safety from insult or attack on their way to the coast. His Excellency said that after reparation had been secured he would make all the necessary arrangements to secure for the troops a safe and proper passage to the coast. „ i - + + + -rr- I communicated the contents of your telegram No. 463 of the 7th instant to His Maiesty’s consul-general at Bushire and to the acting consul at Shiraz. _ Mr. Smart has J replied that, in his opinion, the presence of an inactive force at Shiraz is a sign to the tribesmen that there is a force behind the British representative, even though it may not be a positive factor in the maintenance of British prestige. The removal o the^force would necessitate the consideration of the question how the consular esco t are to be relieved in future, since, in his opinion, tribal audacity would become so increased by the fact of the withdrawal that the tribesmen would be unable any . to resist the bait of a small detachment of men with rifles moving along the road. Moreover he represents that it would be impossible to secure the safe-conduct of British travellers’unde/such conditions, or to protect the telegraph wires and repairing partly He draws a sombre picture of a British colony isolated, telegraph wires chronically interrupted and a consulate without influence, and foresees that such a situation must eventually lead to the reintroduction of British troops in much larger numbers for the eventually reau l fUp province unless circumstances should a°op e £ Mr. Smart, I have the honour to sub - , i )liUt submitting my views, Without the local knowledge he possesses I am diffic f cer tain men known but it would appear to me barely concervable that the smrendet ol ceita ^ to have been implicated in the °f “ the prestige of the December should so fundamental y a ec ^ siibiects, when the withdrawal of British Government and the sa e Y ,1 • . ] ’ attended by the dire results the military force without reparation being exacted is to be attennea y anticipated. o■ pollprl rh^ serious attention of the Persian I have repeatedly, as you are aware Sir, ca led the ser^ that ^ Government to the critical condition o. e qj nt i n g broadly that unless patience of the British Hp ve ^ e “. ls q ernmen t ma y find themselves, against their the situation improves His Majesty t . , ^ ^ reason to know that will, forced to change their present ^nevolent attitude. ^ have comfort Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s departure. j. h &amp;c W.

Idea suggested in my telegram No. 515 of 13th September was to make a verba communication to the Persian Government in following sense As Persian Government are well aware, His Majesty’s Government have been anxious for some time past to withdraw their military detachments from Ispahan and Shiraz, but have been unable to do so for two reasons: firstly, because very concihatoiy conditions laid down in note presented by Sir G. Barclay on 4th Apnl last have been complied with, and secondly, because disturbed state of province of bars h made it impossible for them to feel assured that they could move a small body of troops to coast without fear of insult or molestation. t j • The unfortunate state of the province appearing to have been aggravated m consequence of reverse suffered gendarmerie on 5th August last question was seriously considered by Governments of London and Calcutta as to whether situation was not such as necessitated dispatch of a military expedition fo. _ the purpose °f g the above-mentioned detachments. After a careful examination of aU the condition^ it was felt such action might have a prejudicial effect upon internal situation ot Vers such as His Majesty’s Government have been at great pains to avoid and, news hav ng been received that Mukhber had at last started for his post, it was decided that ti i should be given to his Excellency to enable him to restore order and carry out very mild acts ff reparation demanded by His Majesty's Government for an unprovoked and brutal attack on a British consular officer and Ins escort. In fullest confidence that Persian Government will recognise their friendly attitude His Majesty’s Government feel they can count on them to give ne^ssary mstrimtio to local authorities that all possible assistance shall be rendered at Shnaz in the matter of securing suitable accommodation for British troops now i here, as alj fo r ytechment that is about to withdraw from Ispahan to Shiraz. Failing such help, H s Majesty s Government [?] be constrained to cause barracks to be constructed, and will ie o ige to hold Persian Government responsible for expense so incurred. Such a communication would of course have much more weight if presented in shape of a note or even of an aide~memoire. [767—1355](CONFIDENTIAL. ■fNo. 588.) Sir Edward Grey to Sir W.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 441 of the 6 th August, and to my despatch No. 157 of the 7 th instant, upon the subject of the reverse suffered by the gendarmerie forces near Shiraz on the 5 th instant, I have the honour to transmit copies and para phrases of telegraphic correspondence that has passed between this legation and t e Shiraz consulate. I would also beg to enclose copies of correspondence which has been exchanged between Colonel Hjalmarson, chief instructor of the gendarmerie, and myself upon the subiect of the part played by Mr. Smart in the prelimmanes which resulted in the gendarmerie under Major Siefvert taking the field against Sowlet-ed- DOW From a perusal of these latter papers you will see, Sir that the colonel was disposed to put the blame for Major Siefvert’s rash action upon Mr. Smart who cannot in my opinion, be in any way held responsible for what occurred although he wou d perhaps have been better advised under the circumstances to have dissuaded Major Siefvert at the outset from agreeing to take any part m the expedition. I have also had a conversation with Colonel Hjalmarson, who told me that he had decided, in consequence of what has happened, to somewhat alter his P^, re d Sp f . the policing of the Bushire-Shiraz road. He represented that he personally had always - been opposed to the establishment of a separate gendarmer.e detachmen^ , that he had been obliged to adopt this course against his will by the J^mn ^o ment. He now proposes to return to his original idea, and to prepare a special loice a Tehran for the Shiraz-Bushire road, leaving the 300 men now 'd^raz to finish then course of instruction there.

Sir W. Townley to Acting Consul Smart. (No. 110 .) (Telegraphic.) P. Shiraz, August 7, 191?. I HAVE urged upon the Central Government the great importance of sendin^* Shiraz 25,000 tomans at once. The Minister for Foreign Affairs promises to try and find the money, and the Government fully realise the seriousness of the situation, but pending the conclusion of the conditions of a fresh Anglo-Russian advance there is no money in the Treasury, and the financial situation is extremely critical. The unwill ingness of the Persian Government to accede to the Russian demand for a railway concession from Julfa to Tabriz with an extension to the north of Lake Urmia is delaying the fresh Anglo-Russian advance. It was impossible for me to take any action on your telegram No. 122 , which reached me too late. You acted quite rightly in not trying to dissuade Major Siefvert from making his forward movement. I am very much afraid, however, that the consequences to the gendarmerie of his rash action will be little short of disastrous. Enclosure 2 in No. 1 . Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. (Private.) (telegraphic.) P. Shiraz, August 8 , 1912. PLEASE see last paragraph of your telegram No. 110 . Major Siefvert could not in any case have been prevented in time from marching out. I have only been discreetly sceptical in my despatches Nos. 9 and 10 , because I had no desire to throw cold water on a scheme which His Majesty's Government approve. Swedish officers, however, are entirely ignorant of local necessities, and 1 have no hope whatever that under present conditions they can create a gendarmerie force here. I questioned Major Siefvert persistently on Saturday as to his plans, but could only extract from him that he would see what was to be done as soon as he got to Ghenar Rahdar. I said that he must decide for himself whether or not it was in the interests of the gendarmerie to go with the Government force to Siakh, and I presumed he would keep in communication with Kawam. I feel sure that it never occurred to anyone that suddenly alone and without the knowledge of the local authorities he would march 15 miles through a waterless, mountainous, unknown region to the attack of fortified villages, the failure to capture which at once would at best involve a night spent without shelter or provisions in a hostile desert, especially as he knew that his force would be insufficient in number and composed of untried men. Men were not even supplied with water-bottles. His mistake was in underrating the courage of the tribesmen, and in supposing that wonders could be effected by ill- chosen town recruits, because they were led by European officers. Major Siefvert has infinitely complicated Kawam's task in the present campaign, and has struck a blow at the gendarmerie which may well prove mortal. It is probable, however as Kawam hinted to me m his message of Monday morning, that the major, by leading raw Persian recruits to bayonet charges in the approved Prussian drill-book style, dreamed of distinguishing himself by a brilliant single-handed feat of arms. The above is for your personal information. I will report officially by post as soon as the major is well enough for a long conversation. I will deal gently with him m my report. I hope you will as far as possible attenuate the folly of the owedish officers. They are very much distressed at the incident, and fought with great Enclosure 3 in No. 1 .

Postponement of Kawam’s departure to Khamseh tribes is having effect anticipated in penultimate paragraph of my telegram 119. Mirza Fazlullah Khan,deputy governor, Khamseh, telegraphs it is useless his remaining among tribes unless Kawam comes out by 1st of Ramazan ; that already Arabs, Baseris, and Baharloos, in bands of hundred strong, are on war-path towards Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman ; that loyal Ivalanters cannot restrain their men any longer, &amp;c. Kawam is evidently very apprehensive of effect on tribes of gendarmerie defeat. -&gt;He has telegraphed to Fazlullah minimising defeat, and ordering him to contradict exaggerated tendancieux reports which mischief-makers are likely to spread among tribes. All hardened intriguers in town, kept quiet for last six months, are coming out of their holes again. Kawam has now about 1,000 Arab and 400 Kashgai riflemen in town, whom he has not money to pay. He as yet holds' them in control, though they are of course robbing in and around town in recognised manner of Persian irregulars on war-path. Kawam in consultation with me is taking precautions for protection of British houses distant from consulate, but he anticipates no danger at present. Kawam has summoned Baseri and more Arab riflemen, and‘he expects to have 4,000 to 5,000 tribal levies in town within few days. Allowance must be made for oriental exaggeration in computation, but the presence of large numbers of tribal bandits is unpleasant for the town. Tele phone message from Asker Khan to-day seems to hint than Kawam may have some difficulty in getting further Arab levies, and this difficulty is likely to be increased by gendarmes’ defeat. _ . _ t i i ^ x* Force of Kashkulis and Farsimadanis is being collected m the neigh hour hooey of Khane Kinyan.

Maior Siefvert answered that he was in person on Saturday between 5 and b r.M. Major o ^ 2 [-2597 cc — 8 ]4 of course prepared to assist Kawam. We immediately rode off to the Kawam’s residence to discuss the matter with him. Kawam said that if Siefvert thought his force was competent, he would be very grateful for any assistance it would render him, and that a good moral deterrent effect might be created if the major went to j Chenar Kahdar. We in no way tried to influence the major in his decision, and left I it entirely to him to say what he would do. I explained Government plan oi^ campaign to the major, suggested that it might be better to limit his attention to watching the Bushire road, and expressly said that it was for him to decide whether or not it was good for the gendarmerie to go to Siakh. The consultation was interrupted abruptly by Siefvert announcing that he must be leaving. We rode homeward together, and as I was anxious to know exactly what his intentions were I questioned him persistently. He showed, however, a curious reserve. I put a direct question to him just as our respective roads diverged whether I might send you a telegram saying that he was leaving with 200 gendarmes to hold Chenar ftahdar, and that as regards whether he would subsequently go to Siakh with the Government force he had as yet come to no decision. He said I might telegraph in this sense. I expressed the hope that he would let me know if he wanted my help, and said I presumed he would keep in communication with Kawam. Between 9 and 10 on Monday morning Kawam’s urgent message arrived before I had begun to dress. It seemed so unlikely that I was inclined to doubt its accuracy, but even if I had at once tried to stop Major Siefvert I could not possibly have done so, as he was already in touch with the enemy. After some deliberation I drafted my telegram No. 122, which was somewhat delayed in transmission. The doctor has allowed me to see the major for a few minutes, and I have read the above to him. I added that he should have a copy of my telegram No. 122 and a paraphrase of tins one, and that he was at liberty when better to telegraph his comments on my statement to his colonel. I am sure of the absolute correctness of every detail of my statement, and I trust you will communicate it to Colonel Hjalmarson. In view of this extraordinary charge, you may treat my private telegram of yesterday as official, though I would beg that the personal criticisms and the paragraph about the inability of the Swedes to create a gendarmerie force may be omitted.

A son Excellence le Ministre de Sa Majeste britannique : J’AI fhonneur de vous faire connaitre que, par depeche datee du 4 aout, 1912, de Chiraz, le Major Sievfert m’avait informe qu’il partait avec 250 hommes pour chasser la b '.nde de Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, qui pillait a environ 13 kilom. de Chiraz, sur ia route de Bouchir. Par depdche datee du 6 aoflt de Chiraz on m’informe que, sur les instances du consul d’Angleterre, la plupart des hommes de la gendarmerie etaient parties pour battre la btrlide en question. Mais 1 ennemi avait ete beaucoup deprecie ; en realite ils etaient probablement de 800 k 1,000 hommes, charges de Mausers. C est a environ 40 kilom. a I’ouest de Chiraz que la gendarmerie attaqua hier. L’ennemi, qui occupait une position preparee, attendait visiblement I’attaque. i Sa tactique et sa maniere d’employer le terrain ayant ete etonnamment bonnes et les forces de gendarmerie, n etant pas en nombre suffisant pour supporter 1’attaque, ont et^ obliges de se retirer.

It would appear clear that Major Siefvert took upon himself to carry out a hazardous military movement without previously consulting Kawam-ul-Mulk, who was preparing a force at Shiraz to co-operate with him against Soulet. Although 1 have not as yet had an opportunity of speaking to Colonel Hjalmarson upon the subject, have ascertained from my Russian colleague, who saw the above-mentioned orheer yesterday upon other matters, that he was cognisant of Major biefvert s intention. ^ is most unfortunate that such an occasion should have been utilised loi blooding ^ the raw gendarmerie, and it appears to me to have been hardly in keeping \\ith t icn duties to march out in almost total strength against an enemy, even though he was threatening the security of the road, before any forward movement m the direction oi occupying the road for police purposes had been made and before the intention to take such action had been notified to this legation. I understood that the Shiraz force would not be in a position to endeavour to take over the control of the road before October, and, had my advice been asked, I should have counselled great caution before trying conclusions with such a redoubtable antagonist as Soulet-ed-Dowleh, who was fighting on his own ground and had all the odds in his favour. . , I propose to speak in this sense to Colonel Hjalmarson on an early occasion, but meanwhile no good service would be done by discussing the responsibilities oi a in ® s unfortunate incident that puts the Shiraz gendarmerie entirely outof count for somemonth to come, and which may react most disastrously upon the prestige of throughout Persia. At least 100 of the force at Shiraz had been enlisted at Tehran and had been dispatched to the south to serve as a backbone The small stomach fighting displayed at Diringun will not encourage much faith m the mi i cii} „ of the Tehran force, and may serve to discourage both men and officers, ie a whom experience considerable difficulty as it is in preventing discrtions. In a way the disaster may be said to have cleared the atmosphere, because it has shown us that in considering the means by which order may be re-establishec m e south no count need, for the present at all events, be taken of the assistance likely t be rendered bv the gendarmerie. The task of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh has thus been rendered even more difficult than it was before, and I cannot persuade myself that he | is a man of sufficient capability, determination, and courage to cope with tlm situation. His Excellency has actually moved out of Tehran on his way to Shiraz, but he has ^o uo further than Shah Abdul Azim, some 6 miles away, where he is awaiting additional f t j t „ rp Vn-d to find in the present exhausted state of the Treasury, and i for more money.

Ala-es-Sultaneh promised that he would do his utmost to find some money, but he shrugged his shoulders hopelessly and said that all possible financial resources had been exhausted in finding money for Kermanshah and other places where it is urgently needed, and that the Treasury chest is quite empty.

AS foreseen in my telegram No. 83, Soulet, profiting by absence of Kashgais in north, is threatening Shiraz valley with some 500 mainly non-Kashgai freebooters under his brother-in-law, Soulet himself not accompanying party. Marauders advancing from Khojeh captured Diringun from Kashkuli chief, who with about fifty men fought for one night and then retreated. Yesterday marauders made incursions on to Bushire road, near Chenar Rahdar, but caravans threatened managed to get through safely, while Gellehzan Kashgais, who by good luck happened to be in the neighbourhood, held enemy in check. Kawam has ordered ketkhuda of Dastarjin to detain upcoming caravans, and is stopping caravans leaving Shiraz for few days. Enemy is now in possession of Siakh, and commands first stage of Bushire road. Kawam has summoned Arab riflemen. Kashgai force is already dribbling in. Army, when collected, will march to Siakh. Major Siefvert, with 200 gendarmes, leaves to-day to hold Chenar Rahdar. He has not yet decided whether he will subsequently go with Government army to Siakh. Kawam’s departure to Arabs has unfortunately, but necessarily, been postponed. Local authorities have hardly any money or cartridges. Sarbaz are clamouring for pay. They have long been in bast at Persian telegraph office, and threatening to come to consulate. Kawam has been restraining them, but 31st July they evaded his surveillance by slipping singly out of town and collected behind consulate with intention of forcing a bast, I only succeeded in dispersing them by threatening their officers that my guard would fire if sarbaz came on, and by promising to use my influence privately to obtain them relief. I fear scanty maliat still obtainable must be given to sarbaz to keep them quiet. It is urgent that serious expedition be dispatched to drive back marauders and occupy liruzabad. Some financial help is necessary for this, otherwise Kawam will probably only be able to reoccupy Siakh and drive marauders into Khojeh, whence they wJl return when Government army disperses for want of funds necessary to follow up enemy. Repetitions of these alarms and excursions is most disastrous financially and oi genetal order of the province. Arabs, who had been expecting Kawam, Avill now probably, relieved from fear, redouble their depredations. Could Persian Government give local authorities, say, 25,000 tomans to send force to drive back marauders and occupy Firuzabad ? Money could be largely recovered i om mahatof liruzabad and of Arabs, against whom deferred measures would then be possible; A) 000 spent now would be worth double that sum spent after things have got worse. 1 hope you will be able to persuade Persian Government to succour local autnorities with that sum, without which they can do nothing effective.

Kawam has just sent me urgent message to effect that Major Siefvert ’with his 200 gendarmes, without previously consulting Kawam, left at dawn to-day for Siakh. Kawam’s five sowars, whom lie had given to Siefvert to help latter locally at Chenar Rahdar, begged major to communicate first with Kawam, but he refused. Kawam fears Siefvert, unfamilar with tribal guerilla warfare, may lead his men to defeat, which would have bad effect on future prospects of gendarmerie and on present campaign against Soulet’s freebooters. Arab riflemen entered town to-day, and Kashgai rein forcements are expected to-morrow. Arabs are too tired to start out to-day. Kawam suggests 1 should use my influence to moderate Siefvert’s martial ardour until Govern ment army can join him. Of course above is all Kawam’s message, and I have not yet had time to check his information. As a civilian, I am reluctant to interfere with military dispositions of the major, who might resent my interference. Moreover, if he has really gone to Siakh, he must by now be within the war zone. I propose, therefore, unless I hear from you by noon, to tell the Kawam that I do not think it advisable to interfere. (Repeated Bushire.) Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley.

On urgent representation from Colonel Douglas as to expiry of leatffe of their quarters on 5th October, is Majesty’s Minister at Tehran instructed 5th instant as follows . “ If after consulting Colonel Douglas and the Officer Commanding at Ispahan you consider that detachment there can with reasonable saiety be withdrawn to Shiraz without seriously disturbing the situation at latter place I shall be prepared to authorise withdrawal at whatever moment Colonel Douglas considers expedient, as m any case retention of detachment at Ispahan is no longer desirable.From Viceroy, 7th September 1912. (Repeated to Tehran). Foreign Secret. Shiraz. Your telegram of 30th of August. We have very carefully reviewed the situation, and submit following for Youi Lordship’s consideration. Question of the withdrawal of cavalry from Shiraz was raised m your telegram of 19th June last in connection with lease for barracks. We replied on 12th July that as troops were rather danger than protection they should be withdrawn, but not till October, by which time we hoped new Governor- General might have been able to take such action as would enable us to withdraw without loss of prestige. With this view we understand Jour Lordship and Foreign Office concurred. Then followed unfortunate deteat of gendarmerie with consequent general disorder, the Consul at Shiraz reporting that tribal chiefs round Shiraz (no) longer control their tribes. Accordingly in our telegram of 21st August we proposed that withdrawal of cavalry from Shiraz should be effected under escort of a mixed brigade and that a slight increase be made to Consular escort there. Streng i o _ mict was fixed at minimum necessary for purely defensive and protective objects. From his telegram, No. 80 [? 487], Townley apparently considers proposal a dangerous half measure and advocates punitive expedition if there is to be expedition at all, while His Majesty’s Government are advised that to m i adequate punishment larger force is required. Had a punitive expedition been sent when attack was made on our cavalry our action would have been at least intelligible. It would be difficult to explain now.

SEE your telegram dated the 30th ultimo regarding Shiraz oare f u l review Following is submitted for cons l deration of your Lordship after very eaietu situation :— In your telegram dated the 19th June, 1912 in connection ^ith lease for barracks i raised the question of withdrawing cavalry from Shl ^ 0 ^'^P^ection a lied that troops should be withdrawn, since they were not so much a piotecuo m — 6 ]2 danger, but that withdrawal should be deferred till October, by which time it was hoped that such measures as would permit of our withdrawal without loss of prestige might have been taken by new Governor-General. It is understood that your Lordship and the Foreign Office concurred in this view. Unfortunate defeat of gendarmerie followed, as a result of which disorder became general, and tribes round Shiraz were reported by consul at that place to be no longer under control of tribal chiefs. ^We propose., accordingly in our telegram dated the 21 st ultimo that cavalry should be withdrawn from Shiraz under escort of a mixed brigade, and that Shiraz consular escort should be slightly increased. We fixed strength of force at minimum necessary for purposes merely of protection and defence. His Majesty’s Government are advised that larger force is required to inflict adequate punishment, while His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, as would appear from his telegram No. 80 [? 487], considers proposal a dangerous half measure, and, if there is to be an expedition at all, advocates a punitive one. We should have been acting intelligibly at any rate, had we sent a punitive expedition when our cavalry were attacked. But such action at this stage would be difficult to explain. Idea of punitive expedition had, consequently, been intentionally discarded by us, and in the event of tribes attacking our cavalry or troops, punishment might have been limited to reprisals by destruction of towers and offending villages along the road, after due warning had been given. We admit readily that suspicion of tribes and even of Persian Government will be aroused, whatever the nature of our intentions or the size of our relieving force, and that it would only be with difficulty and with firm determination that any inducement towards action that might involve permanent occupation must be resisted, that withdrawal of regiment could be effected. We have been led to reconsider the position, in view of Sir W. Townley’s opinion, and of the view of His Majesty’s Government, that it would only be possible to effect withdrawal by a force of sufficient strength to punish assailants seriously, and to follow them up for that purpose. There could be only one result, in our opinion, of military measures of above nature, viz., guerilla warfare for prolonged period, with occupation of Southern Persia as a very probable conclusion. We deprecate strongly any action likely to precipitate occupation, though it is a matter for conjecture whether it may be forced upon us in future. To have regiment for the present in Shiraz, and to do all in our power to facilitate new Governor-General’s task, appear to be the only alternative. This course of action will give no cause for effervescence among Indian Mahommedans, while it will have the obvious advantage of being consistent with our avowed policy of abstaining from military occupation and with our demand that perpetrators of outrages on our troops should be punished. This course is therefore recommended by us in the hope that order may have so far been restored by new Governor-General in the space of a few months as to make it possible for our cavalry to proceed without incident to the coast. In the circumstances we deem it prudent that new Governor-General should be given a fair trial, though we cannot be sanguine of bis success. Comfortable and adequate quarters should be provided for the cavalry if it is decided to retain them at Ispahan and Shiraz. Assistance of Persian Government in obtaining such quarters on lease should be insisted upon ; construction of barracks at that Government’s expense will otherwise be necessary.

Tehran, August 30, 1912, 1‘15 a.m. 1 HAVE just received, and am repeating to Shiraz for Colonel Douglas’s views, telegram from Government of India referred to in your telegram No. 538 of 26th. August. I would venture to submit that there are, in my opinion, serious objectio ns to scheme suggested by the Viceroy of India. It would rouse, I think, all the worst passions of the tribesmen and excite fanatical resentment, as its object would be misunderstood and misrepresented. Under present conditions 1 doubt whether consul and British subjects at Shiraz are in any danger, but after the withdrawal situation of the force left there might well be a critical one. Existing difficulty of passing reliefs down road would largely be increased, and the new Governor-General’s task would be rendered vastly more difficult. 1 am firmly convinced that ultimate result would be an expedition on a larger scale and of more permanent nature. I share opinion expressed in your telegram that the force should be large enough to undertake punitive measures if necessary, but I would go further and respectfully suggest that an expedition, if sent at all , should ..be. punitiva, I fear that such a step would entail disruption of Persia, but I am doubtful if a half-measure of the nature proposed would be less disastrous. Should it be decided to take military action, I would beg to support the views expressed by British consul-general at Bushire (see my telegram No. 403 of 7 th July) that the Kazerun Valley should be held until such time as the gendarmerie can take over the road and the abuses of rahdari have been regulated. I am well aware that hopes founded upon a new Governor-General have proved fallacious in the past, but I would venture to call attention to my telegram No. 463 of 19th August, which crossed your telegram No. 495 of 19th August. New Governor-General is now nearing Ispahan, I and should reach Shiraz in ten or twelve days. I have some faith in him if he feels I himself strongly supported by His Majesty’s Government. Kawam-ul-Mulk should leave Ears, and no bast should be given on any consideration to a political refugee. In your telegram last quoted you ask my opinion as to financing the Governor- General direct. I have considered this question carefully, and think that such action might have excellent results. Of the 10,000L recently advanced, 10,000 tomans were paid to the Governor-General to enable him to start and about 20,000 tomans remain in hand for his use on arrival. Were he given from 2,0005 to 3,0005 a-month \ for a year he could make sure of a valuable military force which would enable him to * maintain order. At the end of a year he should have established himself firmly in the province and be in a position to collect all the revenue necessary for the wants of his administration. I would suggest that the money might be paid through the treasurer- general to his agent in Shiraz and handed to the governor in concert with British consul. By this means Persian susceptibilities might be safeguarded in a measure, while none of the money would find its way into the pockets of certain pilfering Ministers. I would suggest that no steps be taken in this sense until we have had time to realise the effects of the military operations if it is decided to undertake them.

FOLLOWING from consular officer at Shiraz, 31st August:— “ Following from Colonel Douglas :— “ ‘ I consider that the force proposed would, under present conditions, be sufficient-' to carry out the measures suggested in Government of India’s telegram, including sending infantry to Shiraz, and even then, once established at Kazerun, they would be strong enough to take offensive action within a limited radius of that town if necessary. I am not a believer in the lighting qualities of the Persian tribesmen, especially if attacked, and my enquiries lead me to believe that no larger force than 3,000 to 4,000 would probably be collected. I doubt, however, whether any serious opposition would be offered to a force of the size it is proposed to send. “ ‘ There is, of course, the danger that agitation fostered by the mullahs would rouse fanaticism of the people and create generally hostility towards foreigners. Even in this case both Smart and myself think that inter-tribal dissensions and dislike of leaving their flocks and families would prevent any general combination of Kashgai tribes against troops. I am not in a position to give an opinion as to the probable attitude of Dashiistan and Tangistan tribes.

Force proposed by Viceroy appears dangerously small, even for merely protective purpose, and any force sent shoidd be large enough to take the offensive and inflict adequate punishment if attacked (see Persia print of 16th January, section 4). &gt; You should request Colonel Douglas to telegraph for my information, and that of Government of India, a report on situation, and to state his opinion as to force required for above-mentioned purpose, bearing in mind that not only have cavalry to be withdrawn, but infantry sent to Shiraz. 4 -V ■li 1 r iFrom Viceroy, 2lst August 1912. Foreign. Secret. Your telegram of 12th August. Shiraz. As, nudging from telegrams from Tehran and Shiraz repeated by Cox, situation is gradually becoming more serious, we submit following views without waiting for Political Secretary’s letter of 16th August. ^ e consider cavalry should be withdrawn from Shiraz as soon as possible I a Consulate guard of 12 cavalry and 1 British officer, and 60 rifles Indian \ infantry being left there. Present guard consist of 12 cavalry and 1 native officer and 31 Indian infantry. This increase is necessary for the protection of Consulate, and infantry are considered more effective at Shiraz than cavalry. In order to bring down the Central India Horse and followers, including 300 baggage mules, without serious incident and in becoming manner, military authorities consider it will be necessary to send a mixed brigade of 1 squadron cavalry, 1 battery of mountain artillery, 4 battalions of infantry, 1 company sappers and miners, and details, from Bushire to Kazerun plain, and thence to send forward detachments to help cavalry over passes. Ihe action of this force would be confined to defensive operations for protection of cavalry on the march, and it would not be used for the punishment of tribes. This is their minimum estimate, and should situation deteriorate larger force may be required. It is imperative to get operation through before passes are blocked with snow. It will take at least a month to collect and equip ships for this mixed brigade. If, therefore, His Majesty’s J Government approve, we should be glad of early orders. After withdrawal of cavalry we propose that a small portion of relieving force should remain at Bushire and Kishm for protection of Gulf ports and to watch eventualities. On this point we will inform Your Lordship later of our views. We regard these measures as best safeguard against becoming ) involved in campaign in Southern Persia, with ultimate risk of permanent occupation. We do not think that with increased guard there will be danger to Consulate after withdrawal of cavalry who at present are local irritant rather than protection.From Viceroy, 12th July 1912. loreign Secret. Your telegram of 19th June. Cavalry at Shiraz. Cox and local officers consider there is no alternative to demand possible, and that failing arrest of ringleaders, barracks should be constructed and cavalry retained indefinitely at Shiraz and Ispahan. We do not, however, agree. Cavalry, through no fault of their own, have been unable to fulfil purpose for which they were sent. They are source of danger rather than protection ; spectacle of Indian regiment thus practically prisoners cannot enhance our prestige. Construction of barracks will indicate permanent retention of regiment^ and doubtless act as irritant giving rise to incidents. Further, such action would make protest against similar action by Russians in Khorasan difficult. W e should therefore abandon idea of retaining cavalry indefinitely under present conditions and of constructing barracks. Cavalry be withdrawn during hot months and must be retained till October, the leases of present buildings being renewed if necessary. It is possible new Governor-General may, in the meantime, take such action as will enable us to withdraw them then without loss of face.

Sir, India Office, 24tlt August 1912. In continuation of my letter No. 3,083, dated the 10th instant, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information * Dated 21st August 1912. ° f , the Seuretar y of S ‘ a te for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram- that has been received from the Government of India regarding the situation in Pars. As was anticipated m that letter the Government of India consider it impossible to effect the withdrawal of the cavalry regiment from Shiraz without despatching a force into the interior, and it is noted that the Governor-Geneial of bars has himself stated that he could not guarantee the safe conduct of the regiment to the sea. The questions to be decided therefore, are :— (!•) Should the regiment be withdrawn by the despatch of a force in the manner proposed; (2.) If so, what should be the functions and strength of that force. In the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion the answer to the first question must depend on that given to the second. He observes that the Governor- General of Pars is apparently unwilling that the regiment should be withdrawn until reparation has been obtained, and though His Lordship is himself prepared to forego that condition, he is strongly of opinion that withdrawal should only be effected in such a manner as to reduce the inevitable loss of prestige to a minimum. This purpose will to some extent be served by the proposal of the Government of India to strengthen the consular guard at Shiraz, which Lord Crewe therefore recommends. » But it can only be completely served if the relieving force is of sufficient force not only to overcome all opposition, but also to inflict serious punishment on the opponents. His Lordship is advised that it is inadvisable, alike on military and political grounds, to limit the relieving force to purely defensive tactics, as suggested by the Government of India, and that the force is indeed small —even dangerously small—even under such a limitation. It is, in his opinion, essential that if it is attacked, the commanding officer should be free to dispose it as he pleases and to take the offensive, to the extent, that is to say, of pressing home at his discretion any defeat he may inflict on the enemy after being attacked by them. Only by this means can the dangerous illusion of the tribesmen as to the inferiority of British arms be dispelled, and the withdrawal of the regiment saved from degenerating into a retreat. But for this purpose—which falls far short of the “ campaign in Southern Persia ” which the Government of India rightly deprecate—Lord Crewe is advised that the force proposed by them is quite inadequate, and in this connection he would invite attention to the Memorandum by the Director of Military Operations dated 15th January last. The Under Secretary of State Foreign Office. S. 176.2 Holding, therefore, the view that withdrawal without reparation should only be effected on the condition described above, His Lordship would suggest that Colonel Douglas should at once be asked to telegraph to Sir E. Grey, and to the Government of India, a report on the situation, and to state his opinion as to the force required. I am to enclose draft of a telegram which, with Sir E. Grey’s concurrence, he would address to the Government of India in this sense. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, R. Ritchie.(No. 465.)

I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6 th instant regarding the retention of the Indian cavalry regiment at Shiraz. The Marquess of Crewe notes that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is in favour of the withdrawal of the regiment, if possible, in October, and that he is prepared to take any measures for the re-establishment of British prestige that may be practicable without the despatch of a force into the interior. The views of the Government of India will be invited on the latter question. In the meantime I am to observe that it is by no means certain that it will be possible to effect the withdrawal of the regiment without the despatch of such a force as was contemplated in January last. It will be remembered that a detachment of 100 men is at Ispahan, and that this very small force has first of all to be withdrawn to Shiraz through a disturbed country —an operation certain to be dangerous unless a considerable supporting force is at hand. Again, the disastrous defeat of the Swedish gendarmerie reported in Sir W. Townley’s telegram of the 6 th August, whatever its ultimate effect on the security of Fars, will, in Lord Crewe’s opinion, have the immediate effect of confirming the tribesmen in their belief in their own invincibility, and therefore of increasing the danger of an attack on the regiment between Shiraz and Bushire. Further, it appears from Mr. Consul Smart’s despatch No. 9 of the 23rd May, that so far as he has been able to keep the road open at all, it is only by enlisting the support of the very chiefs who were responsible for the attack in December; but it would be an impossible avowal of weakness to negotiate with these same persons for the safe conduct of the very regiment which they claim to have defeated. These considerations will doubtless be present to the minds of Colonel Douglas and Mr. Smart, who will doubtless be consulted in good time, and Lord Crewe does not suggest them now as arguments against withdrawal—which he himself reluctantly proposed in my letter of the 22nd July—but merely as a caveat against the supposition that withdrawal is in itself a simple operation, or that it is necessarily an alternative to the despatch of a force into the interior. As regards the proposal to subsidise the Governor-General of Fars instead of the Central Government, I am to say that the effective expenditure of the money appears more likely to be achieved in this than in any other way. But it will presumably be necessary to consider the position of the Central Government and especially of the treasurer-general. If, as there is some reason to suppose, the delay in the departure of the new Governor-General for Shiraz has been due to the unwillingness of M. Mornard to supply him with funds, it may be taken as certain that that official will resist to the uttermost any attempt to finance him direct,* and may possibly have the support of the Russian Government in so doing. While the Central Government, if consulted beforehand, may feel a difficulty in admitting their powerlessness, and, if not consulted, will repeat the protest which they made in March last, when, after Lord Hardinge’s speech in the Legislative Council, it was found necessary to give them the assurances contained in Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 232 of the 2nd April. Lord Crewe would suggest that Sir W. Townley should be consulted on the question of policy ; but in the meantime he notes the instructions conveyed in Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 465 of the 7 th instant, and moreover until the situation created by the defeat of the gendarmerie has developed he is inclined to doubt whether anything can be done. I am, &amp;c. R. RITCHIE. * But it was suggested that one of M. Mornard’s men should supervise. [2597 fc—2]mm ' iMimiL 1 ...

Sir, Foreign Office, August 6 , 1912. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo regarding the retention of the Indian cavalry regiment at Shiraz. I am to state, in reply, for the information of the Marquess of Crewe, that, in \ Sir E. Grey’s opinion, the retention of an inactive and useless force at Shiraz cannot, in the long run, help to preserve British prestige in Southern Persia. He is accordingly prepared to concur in the view of the Government of India that the regiment should be withdrawn in October, provided that there is then no real danger to life and property. As regards the possibility of re-establishing British prestige in the province of Ears, he is prepared to take any measures that the Government of India or the local British officials can suggest which will not entail an expedition into the interior of the country. It appears, therefore, to Sir E. Grey that at present the best course will be perpetually to keep before the Persian Government the urgent necessity of improving the situation in the south to the utmost of their power, and to support the Governor- General in any way that will really help him, subject to the above mentioned reserve regarding the dispatch of an expedition. In this connection, I am to state that Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive the views of Lord Crewe and of the Government of India on the proposal contained in Mr. Smart’s despatch No. 9, Confidential, of the 23rd May (which forms an enclosure in Sir W. Townley’s despatch No. 134 of the 23rd June), to assist the Governor-General by lending direct to him monies for the re-establishment of order in Ears. I am, &amp;c&lt; LOUIS MALLET. [2597/—5] Cpry to I• •' rM A 16 AUG 1912Immediate. P. *2716. Sir, India Office, 22nd July 1912. With reference to your letter No. 26,801 of the 25th June I am dnected by. the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram dated I2th July 1912, that has been received from the Government of India regarding the retention of the Indian cavalry regiment at Shiraz. That regiment was sent to Shiraz for no other purpose than the protection of the life and property of British subjects which were believed to be in danger, and now that the danger has ceased to exist it would naturally be withdrawn but for the complications arising out of the attack on it while escorting Mr. Smart in December last. It appears from Sir W. Townley’s Despatch No. 123 of 18th June, and his telegrams Nos. 397 and 403 of 2nd and 7th July, that there is no ground to expect that our demands for reparation will be met within any reasonable time. In these circumstances Lord Crewe, having regard to the situation as a whole, would propose for Sir E. Grey’s consideration that our demands should not be pressed now in a manner that would increase in any way the difficulty of withdrawing the regiment in October, and is inclined to think that, in spite of the embarrassment that will be created at Shiraz, the regiment should then be withdrawn provided that there is then no real danger to life and property. But though His Lordship would no longer insist on the surrender and punishment of the culprits as the necessary condition of withdrawal, it is obviously desirable that the Persian Government should be encouraged to take measures such as those indicated in Sir W. Townley’s telegram, No. 415, of the 18th instant, and from this point of view His Lordship is inclined to regret that Sir E. Grey does not see his way to press for the appointment of the Zil- es-Sultan as Governor-General of Ears, as suggested by Sir W. Townley in his telegram No. 402 of 7th July. It is true that he has an unenviable reputation for cruelty, but so long as the Persian Government are successful in purging the province, Lord Crewe does not think it possible to apply British standards to the methods employed by their officials. According to the information contained in Sir W. Townley’s Despatch, No. 116, of 17th June, and its enclosures, the state of insecurity on the Shiraz-Bushire road is worse, and the rates of blackmail levied are higher, than ever before. Lord Crewe would suggest that the necessity of arriving at an understanding with the tribes regarding the levy of blackmail should continually be pressed upon the attention of the Persian Government as a condition of the effective working of the gendarmerie.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received Jrdy 7 ) (No. 403.) ' ' ' (Telegraphic.) _ Tehran, July 7 , 1912. FOLLOWING is repetition of telegram No. 165 from Bushire :— “ I can think of no alternative demand which could be substituted for arrest of ringleaders, nor do I think it possible to contemplate withdrawal of troops until that satisfaction has been secured. “ There seems, however, to be no early probability of this, seeing that present authorities in Ears are clearly unable to press Kashgulis in the matter. I am, therefore, of opinion barracks should be proceeded with and cost recovered from Persian Govern ment on evacuation. They would probably be convenient lor the gendarmerie later on. “ In informing Persian Government as above, I venture to think we should add if, owing to non-arrest of certain named ringleaders, we are unable to withdraw our troops by 1 st September, the necessity of keeping open communications with coast will become urgent, and we shall then abandon demand for arrest of ringleaders, and consider measures of our own for keeping the road open until Swedish or other scheme is in course of operation. (Private.) As regards Swedish project, I note that it leaves out of all account question of rahdari at present levied by the headmen to the tune of about 20,000Z. per annum. The solution of this problem by negotiations with headmen seems to be a preliminary sine qua non to the introduction of any gendarmerie scheme on the Bushire-Shiraz road. I do not see how Persian Government are going to settle this question without our help in some practical form. In that case the least formidable, while effective measure which I ? can suggest for consideration would be the occupation of Kaserun plain [? moreover], \ besides being the scene of the recent attack, Kaserun is strategically the most advan- f tageous position on the road, and once established there we should be in a strong position both to overawe the offending Kashgulis and villages, and to assist Persian Government to impose a settlement of rahdari difficulty.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 29.) (No. 150.) Sir, Tehran, Jidy 10, 1912. WITH reference to my telegram No. 403 of the 7th instant upon the subject of the present state of the Shiraz-Bushire road, and the failure of the Persian Government to carry out the conditions contained in Sir G. Barclay’s note of the 4th April last respecting the attack upon Mr. Smart and his escort in the month of December last, I have the honour to transmit herewith translation of a note which I have received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, explaining the steps that the Persian Govern ment have taken with a view to complying with the demands of His Majesty’s Government. It will be seen that Ala-es-Sultaneh states that a telegram has been sent to the ulema and chiefs in Fars, advising them to adopt a friendly attitude towards British subjects and British commerce. I have ascertained that this telegram, a translation of which accompanied my despatch No. 123 of the 18th ultimo, has now been duly circulated, but I am advised by His Majesty’s consular officer at Shiraz that such messages from the Princes of the Church at Nejef and Kerbela no longer have the same effect as in the pasb to allay mischief, though they are as efficacious to-day as ever, they were to afford a good pretext for making trouble. It is true that arrangements have been made for the departure of the new Governor-General, and I am assured almost daily, from one source or another, that he is leaving in a few days. M. Mornard has been freely accused of being the cause of the delay, through his unwillingness or inability to produce the necessary funds for the purpose. I have repeatedly urged upon M. Mornard the urgent importance of arranging the financial difficulties, and have invariably received the most satisfactory assurances that all is m order. Still, Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s departure is delayed, and only vesterday I was aivised by M. Mornard that he had sent a fresh telegram to. Shiraz urging the financial agent there to expedite the necessary payments. Ihis iact proves that, in spite of the repeated assurances to the contrary, there has been some opposition on the part of the treasurer-general for which I am unable to account. In the course of recent conversations, Ala-es-Sultaneh has expressed the utmost confidence in the ability of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh to restore order and secure the arrest of the persons responsible for the attack on Mr. Smart. I he same faith in the new governor is expressed by Sardar Assad, who professes to anticipate a complete resto ration of order in the south with Sardar Jang in charge of the Bakhtiari country and the governorship of Behbehan and the Kuhgeloui tribes and Amir Mufakham at Kerman. I sincerely hope that such a much-to-be-desired situation may be created jy the triumvirate, which, of course, can work in together to some extent, but I must confess that I have some misgivings as to the capability of Mukhber-es-Suitaneh o prove himself a sufficiently strong ruler to cope with the situation, whilst I am sanguine that the two powerful Bakhtiari chiefs on each side of him may rent er goo You will notice, Sir, that in dealing with the clause concerning the punishment of the culprits, Ala-es-Sultaueh’s note states that his predecessor understood from Sir George Barclay that the acceptance by the Persian Government of the obligation to pay 4 , 744 L as compensation had closed the incident, and that the question oi re Dumshment of the offenders would not be insisted upon. . . , There is nothing on record to show that Sir G. Barclay ever made suca asiatemenc, and when Vossuk-ed-Dowleh made the same remark to me some time ago, 1 said tliat I thought he must have misunderstood my predecessor’s meaning, since his nuen ion could only have been to express in bis own name and that of His Majesty s Govern ment his' satisfaction that the Persian Government had so readily lecogmsed toei obligation to pay such a very moderate compensation as that put ioivaid. * I have spoken to Sir Gf. Barclay, who categorically denies this statement.—L. 0. [2545 ff —7]4 If r asserted that the interview in question took place at the Russian Legation whilst Sir G. Barclay and Vossuk-ed-Dowleh were waiting for the Russian Minister. I cannot ascertain that any one else was present on the occasion. Vossuk-ed-Dowleh’s knowledge of French is somewhat elementary, and he may easily, in good faith, have^ construed more into the necessarily complimentary phrases that my predecessor would have used than the words themselves implied. It is noteworthy that if such an assurance were given it would have had equal force for all the clauses of the note of the 4th April, but that the Minister for Foreign Affairs only pleads it as an excuse for the non-fulfilment of the condition respecting the arrest of the real culprits, which is the only one that the Persian Government is not in a position to carry out. I have recently discussed the situation on the Bushire-Shiraz road and the failure to arrest the culprits at considerable length with Ala-es-Sultaneh, and I have pointed out to his Highness the very serious state of affairs existing in the province of Fars. I have shown him that the situation is rapidly becoming an intolerable one, and I have warned him, speaking confidentially in my own name only, that it would appear to me inevitable that His Majesty’s Government will be obliged to alter their piesent conciliatory attitude unless it is seen that the Persian Government are able to restore order on the road, the disturbed condition of which causes such incalculable damage to British trade. His Highness has assured me, in reply, that the Persian Government fully appreciate the friendly attitude of His Majesty’s Government, and that they entirely realise the seriousness of the situation. He has pointed out that special local conditions that have no connection with the unfortunate incident dealt with in the note are responsible for the deplorable state of affairs that prevails, and he has expressed his sincere regret that the Persian Government are unable at the present moment, when a re without any reliable military force at their disposal, and have had to repel the rebellious inroads of a pretender in the north, to take the necessary steps to restore order, ihe Minister has expressed great hope in the future, and' would appear to anticipate good results from the gendarmerie force now being organised under Swedish ° . 18 Highness has added that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh has been given special and definite instructions to assist to the utmost of his ability the Swedish mission. ^ much regret to have to add that from the most recent information upon the last-mentioned point that has reached me it would appear that the Swedish mission in 80 far iaiet l)ut 1]tt le success, in spite of the energy and determination of the ofhcers employed there.

His Highness presses an earnest hope that His Majesty’s Government will give them time in which to prove themselves, and he repeats the oft-told tale that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh is about to start. I am strongly of opinion that a British occupation of South Persia should 1 « avoided as long as may be possible, although I am fully alive to the fact that the present intolerable situation cannot be endured indefinitely. It would, in my opinion be impossible to nx a term for such an occupation, which I fear might be accompanied by very far-reach mg consequences. I am also somewhat sceptical as to how much founda tion there is for the statement it occasionally made that British prestige has been entirely destroyed in the south. Mr. Smart’s correspondence would seem to show that . Cma ^ e h ls influence felt to no inconsiderable extent, although the situation is a difficult one when such men as Mohammed Ali Khan Kashkuli apparently flout all constituted authority, Persian and European alike. Alternative courses to that proposed by Sir P. Cox would appear to me to offer tvt nun VeS * a i 6 0rie &gt; ^ ear a . l° n g er w ifh Persian weakness, and see whether Mukhber-es-Sultaneh s mission will be attended with the success that is anticipated by the Persian Government, giving perhaps a warning that British patience will be exhausted if he fails. The other would be to insist upon the appointment of the Zil-es- Sultan as Governor-General. He i^ probably the only man alive to-day that could be counted upon with some confidence to restore order. It is, however, perhaps late in the day, on the eve of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s departure, to put forward such a proposal which would meet with strenuous opposition from the Bakhtiari, who would have to be cajoled or coerced into accepting the appointment. It is also possible that the Prince would not be willing to undertake the task at his age. I have asked Sir P. Cox for his personal views respecting the Zil’s appointment, and he has expressed an opinion that under certain conditions he would offer a good chance of improving the situation. A satisfactory arrangement that would not tie his hands too much would have to be made with the Bakhtiari, and he would have to be provided with sufficient men and money to render him independent of the conflicting elements in Fars. I have, &amp;c. WALTEK TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1 . Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir W. Townley. (Translation.) Your Excellency, ^ ^ July 2, 1912. IN reply to Sir G. Barclay’s note of the 4th April last I have the honour to state that, as the Imperial Government appreciate the friendly representations made by His Majesty’s Government, and consider it necessary to .make their best efforts to consolidate the existing friendship, they have taken into special consideration the .suggestions made on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the note under reply. Since the receipt of the note in question the Persian Government have not failed to make every effort, and in most of the steps taken they have been successful. These are enumerated here for your Excellency’s consideration. As your Excellency has already been verbally informed, the attention of the clergy has been drawn to the fact that, according to the statement made in the note under reply, the policy of the British Government is based on non-intervention in the south, and telegrams have been sent to the ulema and chiefs in Fars advising them to adopt a friendly policy towards British subjects and British commerce. 2 . Effective measures have been taken for the organisation of a gendarmerie under Swedish officers. A school has been opened at Shiraz, where over 300 men are under arms and being trained. This number will be increased until the plan made for the gendarmerie of the south is put into execution. It is hoped that it will be possible that most of the important roads should be guarded by the gendarmes by next autumn. 3 . Arrangements for the departure of the new Governor-General ot lars have been made, and he will start in a few days.v I *7/ f 4 With regard to the punishment of the culprits implicated in Mr. Smart s incident ' I have the honour to point out that, after the Persian Government had agreed to nav the sum of 4,74 4^ his Excellency Sir G. Barclay thanked my predecessor and assured him that the question of punishment would not be insisted upon, and my predecessor I therefore, considered the question closed. I hope, as I have already told you verbally, that after the arrival of the new Governor-General of Fars local difficulties will be ended, and that the gendarmerie will be more effective. The Persian Government, therefore, hope that His Britannic Majesty s Government will continue to show the good will and friendship they have always shown in the past, and, as promised, that they will recall the Indian troops in Bniraz, Ispahan, and Bushire. ^ I avail, &amp;c. MOHAMMED ALL o[This Document is the Property of His Britamuc Majesty's Government.1 [B] PERSIA. [July ].] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [27782] No. 1 . Sir W. Townleij to Sir Edward Gh'ey.—(Received Jidn l.) (No. 123.) Sir, Tehran, June 18, 1912. AS I had the honour to inform you yesterday in my telegram No. 376, it has not been possible to make any progress in the negotiations connected with the attack upon Mr. Smart and the withdrawal of the British Indian troops for several weeks. Since the 22 nd May there has been a continuous Cabinet crisis, which was only patched up to break out again. The late Minister for Foreign Affairs was closely connected with this crisis, that occupied his attention to the exclusion of all other subjects, the result being that it was hard to get him to discuss questions even of such moment as the one I am reporting upon. Yossuk-ed-Dowleh has at last definitely resigned and his successor has been appointed. Motashem-es-Sultaneh, the Minister of the Interior, called upon me yesterday. In the course of our conversation, his Excellency told me that he had at once, upon assuming office, sent for the papers connected with this incident. He had seen with pleasure that His Majesty’s Government had, as usual, been animated by genuine feelings of goodwill towards Persia, and had made their conditions as lenient as possible. He had, he assured me, telegraphed to the Deputy Governor of Shiraz to instruct him that the culprits must be arrested. His Excellency said that these men are not with Soulet-ed-Dowleh, as Vossuk-ed-Dowleh had told me, but that they are actively employed in combatting that chieftain under the orders of his brother, the present Ilkhani of the Kashgais. This fact, he had impressed upon the Kawam-ul- Mulk, should not stand in the way of their arrest and dispatch to Shiraz for trial. Motashem-es-Sultaneh added that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh, the Governor-General of Ears, is now making preparations for an early departure for his post, and expressed great hope that his assumption of office would be speedily followed by a marked improvement in local conditions. His Excellency further stated that it would seem that the difficulties between the deputy governor and Major Siefert, the senior Swedish gendarmerie officer, had been overcome, and that special instructions would be given to the Governor-General to assist the Swedish officers in their mission. The Minister’s statement about the present whereabouts of the parties directly responsible for the outrage upon Mr. Smart and his escort is confirmed by latest reports from His Majesty’s acting consul at Shiraz. The chiefs implicated are powerful men, and I am afraid that it is extremely doubtful if the Shiraz authorities will be able to effect their arrest under existing conditions. It is possible that the new Governor- General, who will be supported by all the Bakhtiari influence, may feel himself strong enough, after he has taken over the government, to take steps in this direction. I shall impress the necessity for such action upon his Excellency before his departure. I will also call his urgent attention to the importance attached by His Majesty’s Government to the success of the mission of the Swedish officers, which, it is hoped, will result in the reopening and proper protection of the important trade road between Tehran and Bushire. I propose to speak to Mukhber-es-Sultaneh very seriously upon this subject, because I have reason to believe that the all-powerful Bakhtiari chiefs have not been very genuine in their support of this scheme. Mr. Smart telegraphs from Shiraz, in answer to my enquiries, that Mohammed Ali Khan was clearly the person most responsible for the outrage, although he probably called off the second attack and rendered him personal assistance after he was wounded. Mr. Smart adds that Mohammed Ali, who is the head of the Kashkuli, is at present the most powerful Kashgai chief, and that his removal by the Persian authorities would be most difficult for the moment. He considers that, unless His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support a demand for his dismissal by a punitive expedition, in case of necessity, it would be imprudent to do so now, and that it would be better only to press for the surrender of his guilty servants. . . . In answer to a suggestion from Mr. Smart, I have authorised him to write privately [2545 a —2]2 mm tl to Mohammed Ali Khan, telling him that he has hitherto pleaded his cause in return for his kindness to himself, but that he will not be able to help him any more if he does not soon surrender the culprits. Should he return no reply to Mr. Smarts letter or answer evasively, we shall be rid of our obligation to him on account of the assistance he rendered to Mr. Smart, and be free to demand his punishment later on, if considered advisable. Mr. Smart further states that he is continually pressing the chiefs for the surrender of the culprits, but that they plead impotence to do so, because they have all fled to Soulet-ed-Dowleh, or elsewhere out of reach. This was doubtless the excuse made to Vossuk-ed-Dowleh and repeated to me. There seems to be little doubt that the chiefs have not told the truth, but it is Mr. Smart’s opinion that they are unlikely to hand over the culprits except under serious menace. I am afraid that, under these conditions, preparations will have to be made for the troops to remain over the winter, unless His Majesty’s Government are prepared to take steps of such a threatening nature as would induce the Pei'sian Government to bring leal pressure to bear on the local authorities at Shiraz. Such a menace would, however, m all probability entail a military expedition, as the weakness of the Central Govern ment is such that I am convinced that they wdl be unable, for some time to come, to make their influence felt^ at such a distant centre as Shiraz, unless the local chieftains realise that His Majesty’s Government intend to support their demands by an armed force. It would appear ceitain that British prestige m the south has suffered very severely from the effects of this unfortunate incident, and that nothing short of a military expedition wfll serve to re-establish it for a long time to come. At the same time, should such a measure he decided upon, it would probably prove the last blow that would shatter the tottering fabric of Persian independence. I have, &amp;e. WALTER TOWNLEY.Enclosure f~+ter from Foret^'^eccetary, India. A-o. 3 3 iMt'd 15 AUG 1912 CONFIDENTIAL. No. 1626 , dated Bushire, the 28 th July (received 5 th August) 1912 .

I also enclose I9I3 Consul - Shiraz &gt; t0 Resident, dated 27th July copies of further telegrams which have passed during the week, with reference to the situation. 2. The kernel of Mr. Smart’s exhaustive analysis is, it seems tome, to be found in his references on pages and 0 4 to the “ rahdari ” question. I under stood from one of his recent communications that the Swedish staff had taken this question into account, but it would appear that they can only have done so to the extent of realising their inability to cope with it, and of suggesting the postponement of the discussion thereof. In this connection I can but urge the view which I have before expressed, that the preliminary regulation of this fundamental problem, by negotiation with the headmen interested, is a sine qua non to the inception of any scheme for policing the road which does not include its military occupation. On the one hand it can hardly be contemplated that we should be lending money to the Persian Government to finance the introduction of a scheme (for the subsequent maintenance of which they will perhaps revert later on to the suggestion for a surtax on Customs receipts at Bushire), which does not exclude from the outset the continuance of the unregulated levy of blackmail from muleteers, recently estimated collectively at £20,000 per annum, a levy which, in practice, merely becomes an additional charge, in the shape of increased rates of mule hire, on trade goods in transit, mostly British. Until this question of “ rahdari ” is faced and regulated, I fail to see how any gendar merie scheme can be launched with any chance of success. 3. I take this opportunity to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a report drawn up on the subject in last December, by Mr. Chick, the Commercial Adviser to this Residency. Before it reached me the situation had been altered by the attack on Mr. Smart’s party later in the month, and it became inopportune to make any special reportlto Government on this topic in particular ; but Mr. Chick’s communication gives a good idea of the portent of a problem, which must necessarily become an increasingly crucial one in the near future, and is of interest on that account. I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Minister. No. 10 , dated the 15 th July 1912 . From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, I venture to offer some observations on the state of the roads in Pars and on the gendarmerie now being organised by Swedish officers. Shiraz is mainly important for British trade as a depot to which the exports of the province, such as opium and gum tragacanth, are brought from the districtsfor transport to Bush 5 re, and as a distributing centre for merchandise imported vid Bushire. The main outlets of this distributing centre are Ispahan, Yezd and the districts of Pars. The last of these outlets is by far the most important and is at present practically closed for regular trade, whether in exports or imports. The present satisfactory state of the Sarhad route under the guardianship of the Ilkhani of the Kashgais makes a certain amount of retail trade possible with the villages along that road, but the volume of this trade is insignificant. The regions capable of absorbing foreign imports to Shiraz are Eastern and South Eastern Ears, especially the latter. At present the Government does not possess even nominal authority in most of these regions, which are closed to regular caravan traffic. Occasionally a caravan, by paying heavy blackmail to Khamseh tribesmen, can, at considerable risk, circulate in parts of these regions, but the heavy rates of transport under such conditions, together with the attendant peril, render such trade of a precarious and not very profitable nature. The activity of the gendarmerie is, I understand, destined to be limitted to the main road, and its efforts, successful or otherwise, would not directly affect Eastern and South Eastern Ears. British trade cannot hope for any great revival, unless the districts are opened to local caravans and Shiraz pedlars. However, the success of the gendarmerie would open up two important outlets for Shiraz trade, namely, Ispahan and Yezd, for, if the gendarmerie could succeed in estab’ishing itself on the Ispahan postal road, little difficulty should be experienced in maintaining tolerable security on the short stretch of the Yezd road running from the Ispahan road just north of Dehbid to Aberkuh. Moreover, the gendarmerie’s success on the main road would, both by the preliminary coercive measures necessary for its inception and by the moral effect of the opening of the Bushire-Ispahan trade route, greatly strengthen the Government’s authority in the province generally and must incidentally lead to an amelioration of the state of the outlying districts. The main road between Bushire and Ispahan is now in a deplorable state. The Shiraz-Ispahan section is at present closed to caravan traffic, and even to travellers, except under escorts amounting to a military force. In the summer months the Arab tribes, who are entirely out of hand, render any regular traffic on that road impossible. In the winter months Lashanis, Chiharrahis and mis- cellaneous brigands from the villages render the Shiraz-Dehbid section very insecure, but caravans under strong escort are able to circulate with occasional robberies. In the spring and autumn the Abadeh-Aminabad section is exposed to Kuhgelu depredations of monotonous regularity and on a large scale. Sarhad villagers and the inhabitants of Shulgistan and other villages adjacent to the road also prey upon this section in the autumn, winter and spring months. The arrival of the Kashgais in their northern quarters generally renders robberies in the summer between Abadeh and Aminabad unlikely without their connivance. With an Ilkhani well-disposed towards the Government, as is at present the case, the Abadeh-Aminabad section is relatively safe during the summer months. The vagaries of the Arabs, however, between Abadeh and Shiraz during these months compel caravans, to and from Ispahan, to use almost exclusively the Sarhad route. Even caravans to and from Yezd travel by the Sarhad route, using a road running from Aberkuh through Surmek and joining the Sarhad route near Asepas. Since Lie break up of the Government’s authority in Ears the only roads in a relatively satisfactory condition have been those running through KashoM territory and almost exclusively under the control of that tribe. The Jirreh hiruzabad and Sarhad routes, even under an Ilkhani on bad terms with the Government, were generally safe and subject to moderate rahdari, which was mainly confined to the control of one tribe, i he Sarhad route this summer has proved no exception to the rule. Rahdari is of course levied but not so ex orbitantly as on the Bushire road, and caravans and the post have been able to pass in safety. _ The rates of hire, though high, compare favourably with the almost prohibitive prices prevailing on the Bushire road. . . r ^ e difficulty of the Bushire-Shiraz telegraph road lies in the lack of unity in its control. It is normally only disturbed between Kamarij and Shiraz, this section dominated by the Kashgais, being the crux of the road question. In JNovember 1910, as a result of our note to the Persian Government of October14th of that year, Sowlet-ed-Dowleh was induced by the Central Government to abandon his policy of deflecting the traffic to the eastern by-roads and to assume responsibility for the Bushire telegraph route from Shiraz to the border of Kamarij territory. The results were most discouraging. Robberies at once took place, and Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, being unable to control the road without the assistance of the local headmen, was compelled to share the profits of rahdari with them. This naturally involved a large increase of this illegal imposition on the Shiraz-Kamarij section. From Kamarij to Bushire each local Khan of course imposed similar taxes, with the result that the total exactions on the telegraph route were much in excess of the sums levied on the Jirreh or Firu- zabad route. After the eclipse of Sowlet-ed Dowleh in October of last year the route from Shiraz to the Tang-i-Turkan was entrusted to the Kashkuli Khans, and their Chief, Muhammad Ali Khan, was made Governor of Kazerun. These Khans continued the system of sharing rahdari profits with the local headmen. The road question was considerably complicated by the bitter local animosities resulting from Nizam-es-Sultaneh’s disastrous regime and by the disintegration of the Kashgais, w T hose petty chiefs, becoming increasingly inde pendent of the llkhani, tended to exercise an irresponsible, extortionate and multiple control of the road. Khurshid Khan had, until the spring of 1911, been in possession of the Tang-i-Turkan, Rahdar and the adjacent Shapur dis trict, besides the valley of Kamarij. He had kept his section in admirable order, though he had of course levied rahdari like the other headmen along the road. Incited by Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, Nizam-es Sultaneh made a futile wanQ^n aggres sion against Kamarij. Khurshid was driven out, Kamarij plundered, and Sha pur appropriated by Muhammad Ali Khan, who played a prominent part in these offensive operations. Khurshid succeeded in reinstating himself in the Kamarij valley but was unable to recover Shapur, which remained in the possession of Muhammad Ali Khan, together with the control of Rahdar and the northern end of the Tang-i-Turkan. A number of Kamarijis who had betrayed and fought against Khurshid took refuge with Muhammad Ali Khan. These exiles, whom Muhammad Ali Khan was compelled to conciliate, have proved a fruitful source of trouble on the road by their extortionate exactions from caravans and their violent insolence towards muleteers and travellers. One of them, Ali Muhammad Kamariji, who is still in charge of the Rahdar caravan serai, took part in the attack on our troops at that spot. On the other hand Khurshid who had suffered heavy pecuniary loss through Nizam-es-Sultaneh’s aggression, has been endeavouring to recuperate by increasing his exactions of rahdari and even by pilfering from caravans. Needless to say, the hostility existing between the guardians of two adjoining sections of the road greatly added to the uncertainty of that part of the route. To make matters worse, the increasing bitterness of the Kazerunis against the Kashgais culminated in an open breach and the enforced retirement of Muhammad Ali Khan from the Governorship of that town. The Kashkulis retaliated by deflecting the traffic from the Tang i-Turkan to Shapur and thence Did Naudan to Mian Kotal, thus depriving Kazerun of the profits to be reaped from passing caravans. This road is in the summer very trying for mules owing to the prevalence of fly disease. Khurshid and the Kazerunis combined against the Kashgais and succeeded in passing a number of caravans by a very precipitous route from Kamarij to Kazerun via Bardoun, thus avoiding Rahdar altogether. These caravans, when after Kazerun, they again passed through Kashgai jurisdiction, were made to pay very heavily for having avoided the Naudan route. This hostility between the settled population and the Kashgais has caused periodical blocks on the road and a general state of uncertainty, which, together with the heavy exactions of the road-guards and headmen, has raised the rate of hire to almost prohibitive figures. The Kashgais, since they began to migrate northwards, have been compelled to leave the road almost entirely in the hands of the local headmen, to whom they have leased the road, section by section, from bhiraz to lang-i- Turkan vidb Naudan. The headmen have to levy from caravans enough rahdan to pay for these leases and to make their own profit at the same time. It is not easy to ascertain the exact amount of the rahdari levied^ for the muleteers exaggerate the figures in order to increase their rates of hire. Moreover, the exactions vary, Kazerun muleteers being more heavily mulcted by the Kashgais than muleteers from other parts. On an average, however, it is probable thatr 4 for a single journey the muleteers have to pay about three tomans a mule in rahdari. The road-guards also help themselves freely to sugar and tea from the loads and even pilfer fitfully from other merchandise that takes their fancy. Fodder along the road is of course sold to the muleteers at extravagant prices. I have in previous communications reported the difficulties of passing European travellers along the Bushire road, for, since the unpunished attacks on our troops, the road-guards have lost their respect for Europeans, who are blackmailed and insulted more than Persians. I have not failed to make continual and earnest representations to the local authorities regarding this deplorable state of affairs on the most important route for British trade in Persia, Without money or troops the local authorities are unable to take any heroic measures, and we can at present only hope for some slight palliatives to this disastrous situation. Any permanent improvement on the main road from Shiraz to Abadeh can only be effected by some sort of repressive action against the Arabs. If the Central Government grant permis sion, Kawam-ul-Mulk proposes to go out in person to deal with these turbulent tribes. He hopes to overawe the recalcitrant sections with the help of the relatively loyal chiefs and a force of Kashgais supplied by the Ilkhani. It is very doubtful whether any efforts he can make will result in the opening of the northern postal route during this summer. Any permanent improvement on the Abadeh-Aminabad section would only result from punitive measures against the Boir Ahmedi, and I see no possibility of such action in the near future, unless the Bakhtiaris could chastise this turbulent tribe. With regard to the Bushire road, i^appears that the natural causes mentioned above, combined with Kawam-ul-Mulk’s incessant pressure and the Bardoun route development, have forced the Kashkulis’ hands. Muhammad Ali Khan has notified Kawam-ul-Mulk that the road-guards have been withdrawn from the Naudan route, and Ali Muhammad Kamariji at Rahdar has informed the muleteers that they can go by whatever route they wish. This would seem to indicate that the Kashkulis have at length acquiesced in a reversion to the main road. However, no permanent improvement in the Kamarij-Shiraz section can, it would seem, be effected except by a compromise between the Kazerunis and the^ Kashgais or by restoring Kazerun to the Kashgais For the first purpose it would be necessary that an impartial Governor proceed to Kazerun as soon as possible. Nasir-ed-Divan, the Kalantar of Kazerun, at present in charge of that town, is on the worst possible terms with the Kashkuli Khans. With a neutral Governor at Kazerun the bitterness of the Kashkulis might be moderated, and they might be more amenable. However, the attitude of Muhammad Ali Khan who, since the unpunished attacks on our troops, seems to entertain exaggerated notions of his own power^ is not encouraging. Pressure might be brought to bear on him through his fear of his cousin Muhammad Khan, who, is hostile to him. Pressure of a different kind might be exercised against him and the other Kashkuli Khans as well as against their adversaries among the settled population on the telegraph route, by the .temporary opening of the Jirreh route with the help of the Farsimadan Kashgais, wtm have been detained this summer in the neighbourhood of Shiraz as a pro tective measure. Both parties would suffer considerable pecuniary loss by the adoption of the Jirreh route, which might facilitate negotiations for a compromise. Failing such a compromise, the only solution would seem to be the forcible re establishment of a. Kashgai nominee in the Governorship of Kazerun and the sacrifice of the special interests of the settled population in favour of the general interests of the road. This arrangement would not be easy to effect: it mio’ht cause serious complications and the temporary closure of the road: it would moreover, be very inequitable and objectionable for the undesirable increase it would cause in the already excessive power of the Kashgais. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that for several years the Kashgais have had control of azerun, and their resentment at their ejection from that town is easily com prehensible. J The foregoing description of the conditions prevailing on the Bushire- Ispahan main road will perhaps give some idea of the magnitude of the task con- ronting t is gendarmerie. Its establishment on the whole of this road wouldinvolve conflict with the Kashgai, Khamseh and Boir Ahmedi tribes, apart from minor operations against miscellaneous brigands from less important tribes and from the settled population. If rahdari is to be abolished, conflict with the local headmen from Shiraz to Bushire would be inevitable. I do not propose to trouble you with academic observations on a scheme of this magnitude. I will confine my remarks to an examination of the possibility of the Shiraz Kamarij section, on which, I gather, the Swedish officers propose to experiment in the autumn with six hundred gendarmes. It is obvious that the Kashgais, who control the greater part of this section, will not easily forego the income and political power which they derive from the guardianship of the road. Six hundred gendarmes are clearly inadequate to coerce a powerful tribe in its rugged mountains. Under present' conditions the only conceivable method of procedure would be for the gen darmerie to come to an agreement with either the Kashgais or the settled population along the road. An alliance with the Kashgais, if feasible, would be, on the whole, more convenient for the gendarmerie, because they are the stronger party. The hostility of the Kashgais would result not only in active opposition from that tribe but would also excite against the gendarmerie many warlike, pre datory elements of Western Pars, especially the Boir Ahmedi, whose regular November incursions on the road between Khan-i-Ziniyan and Dastarjin would, with Kashgai encouragement, tend to become more frequent. Coperation with the Kashgais, however, could only be secured on very disadvantageous terms for the welfare of the road and the authority of the Government. Moreover, owing to the vicissitudes of tribal fortunes and the present disintegration of the Kash gais, such co-operation would be of a precarious nature. Combination with the settled population against the Kashgais would be more equitable, and more in harmony with the principles of sound Persian statecraft, which has always endea voured to counteract and circumscribe the dangerous power of the tribes. Such a combination would, if successful, be of a more stable nature. The Kadkudas of Khan-i Ziniyan and Dastarjin, the Kalantar of Kazerun and Khurshid could doubtless be enlisted in such a combination. But the successful formation of such a combination would require, on the part of the gendarmerie officers, inti mate knowledge of local conditions and politics, much tact and skill, infinite caution, and the cordial co-operation of the local authorities. The support of either the Kashgais or the settled population could only be secured by acquiescing in the levy of rahdari at a moderate rate. Any attempt to abolish rahdari entirely and immediately would mean that the gendarmerie would be faced by the hostility of both the Kashgais and the settled population along the road. Such general opposition would render the task of the gendarmerie quite impossible. It might be practicable to levy a tax on caravans in Shiraz and from the proceeds pay subsidies to the local headmen as a substitute for rahdari levied on the spot. The danger of this compromise would be that the headmen might take the subsidies and still continue furtively to levy dues on passing caravans. I have, in the course of informal conversations with Major Siefvert, endea voured to explain to him the conditions prevailing on the road and the general political aspects of the province. It is of course impossible to expect European officers without any knowledge of the languages or the peculiar conditions of the East to realise immediately the complicated situation in Ears. Major Siefvert appears to be a reasonable, energetic and able officer, and I have no doubt that in time he will gain the experience necessary for the comprehension of the local situation. He hopes shortly to proceed to Bushire to bring up 1,500 Mauser rifles and 500,000 cartridges for the^gendarmerie—an enterprise not free from difficulty and danger, for these arms and ammunition will be a tempting bait for the tribesmen. He will avail himself of this journey to study the road-questions on the spot. It is unfortunate that his ignorance of the language compels him to act through native interpreters, so that his information cannot be always quite accurate. However, I hope that he may gradually acquire enough information to enable him to devise some practical scheme for his future operations. Until then detailed examination of the possibilities of gendarmerie action on the Shiraz-Kamarij section would seem unprofitable. A few remarks on the formation of the force and its relations with the local authorities at Shiraz may be of more immediate interest. In my telegram No. 87 of May 22nd last, 1 conference between Kawam-ul-Mulk and Major Siefvert, reported on the informal at which I assisted to6 interpret and facilitate the discussion. The imprudent enlistment of some of Kawam-ul-Mulk’s bitterest enemirs and other circumstances had excited his apprehensions that the force was intended to be directed against himself. I do not wish to decide the balance of the rights and wrongs of the two parties. No doubt Major Siefvert was rather imprudent in his treatment of Kawam-ul-Mulk’s tribal road-guards (see my telegram No. 62 of April 10th last), in the uncompro mising attitude he at first adopted towards the local authorities, in arresting townsmen, in emphasising his independence of the provincial Government, in enlisting recruits regardless of considerations of local politics. On the other hand, Kawam-ul-Mulk was perhaps unduly suspicious a ;d irritatingly obstructive. The trouble w^as mainly due to the casual procedure of the ignorant Central* Government, which sent the Swedish officers here without thinking out before hand some^ practicable scheme for the relations between Major Siefvert and the local authorities and without even giving any information to Kawam-ul-Mulk for his guidance. At the meeting mentioned above, a reconciliation was effected. It was not of long duration. Kawam-ul-Mulk asserted that Major Siefvert was weakening the authority of the provincial Government by arbitrary arrests and punishment of townsmen, by ignoring the jurisdiction of the local administration. He complained, with some justice, that Major Siefvert was surrounded by notorious enemies of the Kawami family, who poisoned his mind against Kawam-ul-Mulk. Major Siefvert declared, not without reason, that Kawam-ul-Mulk was unfriendly to the gendarmerie, that the townsmen, aware of this, lost no opportunity of making difficulties for the newly created force. Finally a rather serious incident occurred. A quarrel between some gendarmes and “ sarbaz ” resulted in the arrest and imprisonment of the latter in the gendarmerie barracks, which are situated in the Maidan-i-Tavileh opposite the Government palace. This palace is at present little used, Kawam-ul-Mulk never going there and Mudabber-es- Sultaneh, the nominal Deputy Governor, only visiting it fitfully for the transaction of business in the interval of his frequent inebriation. It is, however, guarded by Government riflemen. The comrades of the imprisoned sarbaz made an angry demonstration before the gendarmerie barracks, at which they fired some fifty shots. The gendarmerie also^ fired a few shots, but neither side appears to have had any murderous intentions. Mudab^ir-es-Sultaneh, whose private house is close to the barracks, proceeded to the scene of action and shut up the sarbaz in^ the palace garden. The appearance of the Deputy Governor and of Major Siefvert, to whom the former had sent an urgent summons, prevented any further hostilities. Kawam-ul-Mulk addressed a private complaint to me on the subject. He stated that, if Major Siefvert began arresting sarbaz in this manner, serious trouble rmght ensue. Major Siefvert likewise complained to me. He declared that the Government riflemen had also fired on the barracks from a tower of the palace. He demanded that this tower which commands the barracks and the entrance to the Maidan should be handed over to the gendarmerie. He intimat ed that he suspected Kawam-ul-Mulk of complicity in the incident. . 'T? the matters were then getting serious, I thought it advisable to intervem privately. I pointed out very strongly to Kawam-ul-Mulk the importance whicl the Persian Government and His Majesty’s Government attached to the gendar V Yarned n ln i that ’ Un eSS he C0 -°P erated lo yally with the gendarmerie lf h T ld be c o. m P el ed to report to you most unfavourably regarding his attitude At the same time, I begged Major Siefvert to be as careful as possible t humour the susceptibilities of the local authorities and not to allow himself to fa under the influence of Kawam-ul-Mulk’s enemies. I arranged another meetim between the pair which took place at Kawam-ul-Mulk’s garden, the Salarriyeh Mudabber-es-Sultaneh was also present, and I acted as interpreter r/airb the h Doim S rais S er S10 RVL aStln ^ for j. 1 ^ 6 hours &gt; terminated in an agreement on al the points raised.

At the termination of thi:somewhat e^austive discussion, Kawam-ul-Mulk sealed the reconciliation by entertaining us a^ lunch, after which the party broke up with many mutual pro testations of friendship. A month has passed since that meeting, and the peace established then has not yet been disturbed. It is probable that disagreements will again arise, but I hope that they will not be too serious to admit of renewed adjustments. Major Siefvert hopes to have raised his 600 gendarmes by the middle of August, though at present he has only half that number. At the beginning he recruited many townsmen, and there were a number of desertions Latterly he seems to have realised that such recruits were not very suitable, and he has been endeavouring to attract villagers. He recently made a trip to Maloo and other villages around the Salt Lake in search of recruits. He sent a certain Muhammad Jaafar of Angali, a gendarmerie officer, down the Bushire road to find recruits, more especially from A/gali. This person, however, besides having 'jif fought against Kawam ul-Mulk last year, appears to be on bad terms with the Governor of the Gulf ports, who, it seems, rendered Muhammad Jaafar’s mission abortive. Major Siefvert hopes, in the course of his trip to Bushire, to collect the lowland recruits whom Muhammad Jaafar failed to secure. He proposes also to engage gendarmes from the local headmen along the road, such gendarmes to serve only in their respective districts. The role of such men would be largely that of information agents and scouts. I presume that Major Siefvert would only begin operations with the agree ment of the local authorities whose cordial support is essential. It will not be easy to secure their wffiole-hearted co-operation. Any Persian local authority is unlikely to view with favour a force which claims complete independence of that authority. Moreover, Persian officials doubtless object to the [expenditure on such a force of money which otherwise might contribute to line their own pockets. In addition to this, they do not yet take the gendarmerie seriously. As the Swedish officers have no adequate force behind them, they can only overcome local obstructions or apathy by a judicious mixture of firmness and compromise, by tactful consideration of local susceptibilities and interests, by sacrificing the form for the substance, by refraining from emphasising an inde pendence which they cannot support by force, and by the pressure which His Majesty’s Consulate can still bring to bear on the local authorities and notables of Pars. It is, anyhow, essential that the question of the mutual relations of the gendarmerie and the provincial Government should be defined in a satisfactory manner. Personally I do not think that the complete independence of the gendarmerie is feasible, because no local authority would co-operate on such terms. Perhaps the best compromise would be that Major Siefvert should be quite independent in the internal arrangements of his force, but that in ail matters relating to the administration of the province he should be instructed to defer to the Governor’s wishes, except in cases where he considers that such acquiescence would be prejudicial to the interests of the gendarmerie. In such cases a right of appeal to the Central Government should exist, and it would then be for the Minister of the Interior, in consultation with Colonel Hjalmarsen, to give a ruling, Presuming, however, that the gendarmerie and the local authorities were working in harmony, the first step in the inception of operations must be to negotiate with the tribes and headmen. For instance, it is probable that when Major Siefvert wishes to take over the Kamarij-Shiraz section of the road, the Pars Government may find it impossible to come to a satisfactory arrangement with the Kashgais. The choice would then lie between postponing the gendar merie operations or breaking with the Kashgais. The question is whether the gendarmerie, after causing the break up of the Government tribal combination, could protect the Government against the results of this disintegration. It requires considerable optimism to hope that 600 gendarmes of untried military value under Swedish officers unfamiliar with the intricate tribal and political fabric of Pars could replace the elaborate and ingenious system by which, with great difficulty, peace is maintained in the vicinity of Shiraz, a road, however unsatisfactory, kept open to Shiraz and Ispahan, and the Government’s authority precariously maintained in some of the outlying districts.8 Major Siefvert and his colleagues are nowise lacking in energy and ability, bat they have been set a task of the greatest difficulty. I doubt whether Englishmen or Russians possessing the invaluable advantages of an intimate knowledge of the language, of local conditions and politics, of Oriental character, of being personally acquainted with, and respected by, the tribal chiefs, nobles and officials of the country, of being able to rely on the often obsequious co operation of the local authorities, could successfully replace the present tribal domination by a locally raised gendarmerie, without long and gradual prepara tion, without, perhaps, even the support of foreign troops. It would, therefore, be unreasonable to expect rapid success from the efforts of Swedish officers possessing none of these advantages I venture to hope that the commence ment of the gendarmerie operations will not be unduly precipitated. Such precipitation might cause the definite failure of the scheme and, by breaking up the Government tribal combination, create a state of anarchy in the province even worse than at present existing. It would be much wiser to keep the gendarmerie in Shiraz, increasing its efficiency and numbers, than to risk a disastrous fiasco by premature action. Thus retained at Shiraz, the gendar merie might gradually develop into a useful regular force, somewhat similar to the Cossack brigade, which would strengthen the Government’s authority and could, as occasion arose, be used in co-operation with the Government’s irregular troops, for punitive expeditions and in time be put out on the road. In this and preceding despatches I have not taken into account the effect which the appointment of Zil-es-Sultan to the Governorship of Ears might produce on the situation. His name, his wealth, if utilised, might perhaps produce, in a lesser degree, the magical effect caused by his last, brief adminis tration of Ears. On the other hand, the disintegration of all authority, the insolent independence of the tribes, may have reached a stage at which even Zil-es-Sultan’s unrivalled influence would prove ineffectual. The present pro- Bakhtiari governing tribal combination in Ears is, in its vital interests, opposed to Zil-es Sultan, and it might conceivably, if incited, openly or secretly, by the Bakhtiaris controling the Central Government, make its opposition effective. Needless to say, if Zil-es-Sultan’s appointment were not secured after it became known that we had been supporting his candidature, the sympathies of this combination might be alienated from us and the difficulties of our position in Ears might be greatly increased. The consequent diminution of our influence over the governing party would react very unfavourably on the gendarmerie, for that influence is its most valuable asset in overcoming local obstruction and apathy.

There is no idea at the present moment of putting in the Kawam-uU Mulk as Governor-General of Pars. I am personally opposed to the proposal. His Majesty s Government do not seem inclined to jump at hints regarding the Zil-es-Sultan so for the present at all events that idea also is shelved This leaves us with no alternative but the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh for whose immediate departure for Ears I am pressing. I am not very optimistic as to his ability to accomplish much but in the desire that some improvement may occur in the situation I propose to give him all possible support. 7 You may rest assured that you will be consulted beforehand, as in the past should any radical change affecting Ears be at any time contemplated.

Present vague uncertainty is likely to be chronic but there are for moment no signs of serious trouble. I think warning might now be withdrawn. Shiraz ; December gth, igu. Sir, I have the honour to lay before you my impressions regarding the problem of the Bushire-Shiraz road, gathered during the months of October and Novem ber when I have been continuously passing up and down the route. The disorders on the two stretches of the caravan road between Bushire and Ispahan are essentially different in kind and proceed from two different causes. While as I understand it—the Ispahan section, lying partly in the province of Pars, partly in that of Ispahan, passes through a no-man’s land, is entirely unpro vided with road-guards, and is at all times open to marauding by tribes, such as the Boir Ahmedi and bands of local robbers, local inhabitants and muleteers themselves undoubtedly participating in the plunder, the Bushire section on the country suffers chiefly from being over-run by well armed blackmailers, whose chiefs regard the stretch of road passing through the district of each as^ their own property and a source of personal revenue to be exploited at will. Risk of almost certain robbery has caused a practical cessation of the passage of caravans between Shiraz and Ispahan: oppression and feuds between the chiefs of districts along the road from Bushire to Kazerun, in which the muleteers are generally made the object of reprisals, have gradually driven muleteers of/the road, driven trade and prosperity away, and kept the security of that part of the route in a constant state of uncertainty. Whereas five or six years ago some 7,000 mules used to work constantly between Bushire and Shiraz, now-a-days 1,500 mules can be found with difficulty, and work intermittently. The price of transport for every 750 lbs. has risen from :— 1905 . To Now Bushire to Shiraz 80 Krans 250 (when muleteers ventured to Shiraz to Ispahan 150 „ 340 proceed.) Krans 230 (about £ 3 - 16 - 8 ) 590 (about £ 11 - 2 - 8 ). On the Bushire-Shiraz section, the migration of tribes Spring and Autumn has of late years caused for a few weeks a wave of destruction along the tele graph line and unrest on the caravan road from near Kazerun to Dashtarjin, but only the stretch of road between Dashtarjin and the neighbourhood of Khane Zinian is subject to pferiodical descents of marauding tribesmen for the express purpose of attacking caravans. Blackmail and oppression however appear every where in multifarious forms and from complicated causes. By far the most serious of these forms is “ rahdari ”—which was abolished with other internal exactions by the Persian Government in 1903, and was intended as a substantial set-off to the rigours of the Commercial Tariff, whereas it has increased from year to year. Until the question of “ rahdari ” is effectual ly dealt with under pressure from the British Government there seems little chance of order and security being restored, and traffic on the road from Bushire to Shiraz recovering jits former proportions. The Persian Government would be unable, in any case for a number of years, to undertake the task and fulfil its own engagements. For some years past we have kept in the Residency records of the amounts of u rahdari ” exacted from muleteers at various posts of tufangchis, which show no sign of decrease : but from the point of view of revenue thus accruing to local chiefs figures are still more striking.Even at the Bushire town-gate the sum levied till recently by the local Governor and included in the schedule of revenue (despite the Commercial Con vention), at the rate of one kran, three shahis per mule must have brought in at l east l) OQQ Tomans {£ 2,000) a year. After enquiries from reliable local sources I should estimate that the revenue derived by the chiefs themselves from “ rahdari ” by :— Agha Mustapha at Chogadak, is Tomans 5 , 000 ... Sheikh Hussein of Chakutah at Ahmedi Tomans 10,000 Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh at Boras]un „ i5&gt; 00 ° Nur Mohammad Khan at Daliki » 25,000 Nur Muhommad Khan at Konar Takhte ,, 15,000 Kedkhudas at Jafferjin ... » 7&gt;5 0c&gt; Khurshid Khan at Kumarij ... „ 10,000 (A 1 , 000 ) {£ 2 , 000 ) (A 3&gt; 000 ) {£ 5&gt; 000 ) {£ 3) o:o ) {£ 1 , 500 ) {£ 2 , 000 ) (From the Tang-i-Turkan to Chenar Rahdar the chiefs of the Kashkuli tribe, Muhammad Ali Khan and his cousins, have accepted the responsibilities and duties of furnishing guards for the road, and protecting caravans from robbers. For political reasons they were chosen for this purpose by Ala-ud-Dowleh and Kawam-ul-Mulk when the Kashgai Ilkhani Sowlet-ed-Dowleh resigned respon sibility in October last. As in the case of former arrangements with Sowlet-ed-Dowleh the Persian merchants of Shiraz on the other part—-on their own responsibility and without consulting foreign rights—agreed to guarantee the payment to the Kashkuli Khans ofthe sum of 1,000 Tomans {£ 200) per mensem for their services and to provide the money, arranged that every mule bringing merchandise to the town should be charged 3 Krans (about 14 &lt; 1 )&gt; and every donkey two Krans (q d.'\ paid into a fund administered by certain amongst their number. In con versation one principal merchant explained to me that at least 1 , 5 °° Romans \r o 0 o) should be forthcoming monthly at these rates, but the excess would be placed towards any deficit in future months. Certain of the merchants thought that two Krans per mu'e (9 d.) as formerly, would have been sufficient, and if the income is found to be much in excess of the sum guaranteed he thought that they might reduce the rate of that figure. The sum therefore to be paid to the Kashkuli Khans for providing road guards from Tang-i-Turkan to Chenar Rahdar will amount to 12 000 Tomans (^2,400) for the year. The amount, which these merchants may take from muleteers on their own representations may conceivably at the present rate reach the figure of 18,000 Tomans (£3,600), as long as traffic continues fairly regular : but, judging from the estimated revenues derived elsewhere from a lesser tax per mule, I should not be surprised if the takings at Shiraz for the whole year did not exceed £4,000 considerably. Into whose pockets the balance will go is so far undis closed. Caravan traffic and transport between Bushire and Shiraz would, on the basis of the estimates given above, pay over to chiefs—for the nominal privilege of being guarded or of passing through certain districts only by a certain route— the sum of £21,900 per annum (the Persian Government in the Commercial Convention of 1903 having stated that nothing was chargeable. The evil does not stop here, for, if the chiefs provide their tufangchis as guards, in some cases getting a rebate on their mahyat for payment of wages, they expect to retain for themselves the whole sum^ charged at Borasjun, Daliki, Shiraz, etc., and leave their tufangchis to earn their own livelihood by taking as much along the route as they can from passing muleteers in money, bread, sugar, tea, etc. Thus the so-called road guards are in practically no instance paid by their chiefs, indeed in many cases the tufangchis have to hand over to their chiefs a certain proportion of their exactions. The sums extorted by road-guards on eachleaf ;&gt;&gt; w : k 'I V„ 11 mule, 2 shahis here, and 4 shahis there, sometimes 3 or 4 times between the stages, must amount as between Bushire and Shiraz to several thousand poun s each year. The Kashkuli Khans, loath apparently to have to put a large number of their own tribesmen along their stretch of the road have hit on the expedient of attaching to their interests the Khans of the Dushmanzian by calling on them to furnish men from the Mamasenm tribe as guards between the Maserm Tower and Chenar Rahdar. These wild men naturally fee that they are placed there in order to become rich in as short a time as possible. The Kashkuli Khans are in fact doing nothing themselves towards furnish- mg a force of guards, beyond placing a post of their own tribe in the caravan- serai at the end of the Tang-i-Turkan, and another at Khane Zinian. From Fu Abtineh to the top of the Kotal-i-Dukhtar the route falls within the district of MohameflsmaU Khan ; from the Ab-Ambar in the Dasht-.-Barm to the top of the Pir-i-Zan pass within that of his relative, Hap Abdullah Khan of Keluni. The latter sta f ed in my presence to one of the merchants of Shiraz that he and his rektive had beeu told by the Kashkuli Khans to supply guards from the village people, and had done so up to the present, but wished now to dissociate themselves from the protection of the road. He said that there were only 2 posts or beats of tufangchis in his borders, that the revenue from the 4 shah.s per mule taken at each of these, only brought &gt;n some IS o Tomans per mensem, whereas the Kashkulis extracted from him for these two posts co to 100 Tomans monthly, and left him to bear the expense of paying his tufangchis- otherwise left them to pilfer. These details will show what a large vested interest the chiefs and their tufangchis have in caravans passing over their road, and my previous despatches regarding the passage of our military caravans laid stress upon the importunity with which the 5 local tufangchis pestered our hired muleteers, strongly guarded as thly werl and upon thf unwillingness of the Khan to allow even our mules to pass without paying similarly to merchants mules. As a matter of principle it has been a Khans and tufangcais to extort “ rahdai military convoys. Muleteers agree unwillingly, for both chiefs and tufangchis resent our action and the muleteers have been charged double exaction and maltreated on the retu^ iourney when they are no longer under our protection. To give a typical instance: on the occasion of the passage of the first wing of the regiment by Konar Takhte a shot was fired, and the culprits disarmed by our sowars. To prevent repetition of such offences their Kedkhudas were told that the rifles would be retained until the arrival of the second wing of the regiment. So persistent were the Kedkhudas for the return of the weapons that they menaced the Persian mule-owners, and compelled them to sign a bond to pay 500 Tomans in the event oTthe rifles not being restored. After our departure the door of the Telegraph Department Room, in which they had been locked, was broken open and the rifles carried off, probably by the owners themselves; yet there is every probability that the village chiefs will pretend that unknown persons too the rifles and compel the wretched muleteers to pay the bond. It is evident that the proposal for bodies of Indian Cavalry to escort British caravans up and down the Bushire-Shiraz road will not alone put a stop to the ex ortionate exactions of “rahdari” from We muleteers under our protection for the time be^'g As long as “ rahdari ” flourishes the present dear rates of hire Will continue fnd a large part of the road question remains unsolved. Nor would the actual placing of posts of Indian troops at the various stages nor anything short of punitive measures against the various Khans, by driving them out or disarming their men, appear to me to meet the case. For if foiled in their attempt to levy “ ra hdari;, wh,ch is.a per mule—the Khans would and^rain 0 ^rnul^teers to certain of their subjects will be essential to refuse to allow from mules forming part of our WA* V A-r 12 supplies a charge for each mule, collected by and from thf» knUo r i monopoly. '‘Alafi ,, is even now charged at sevprpl Qf 6 ho ^ ers “ rahdari .

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of despatch No. 9, dated the 23rd May 1912, received from His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, on the subject of the situation in Pars, together with a copy of a telegram which I have sent to J His Majesty s Minister in connection there with. Shiraz ; 23 rd May igi 2 . No. 9'Confidential. Sir, Now that the tribes have passed Shiraz and I have a little leisure from the continual distractions of the tribal migration, the time would seem opportune for a review of the situation in Ears during the last three months and of its possibil ities for the future. The Kashgai question has of course been the dominant factor in the tribal imbroglio. I have already reported by telegram the details of the typically Persian campaign by which Sowlet-ed-Dowleh was ousted from the Chieftainship of the Kashgaftribes. This action of the Persian Government has, as I have previously pointed out, come too late to be really effective. Two years ago the dismissal of Sowlet-ed-Dowleh might have brought about a general restoration of order in the province. Today its effect can only be partial and temporary, unless supported by a Government stronger and more stable than that which has misruled Pars for the last few years. Tribal warfare, unsupported by Govern ment force, is generally inconclusive in Persia, and such force is lacking today. Sowlet-ed*Dowleh may—another Naib Hussein—long roam at large, stirring up disorder, making trouble for the Ilkhani, intriguing with any elements among the Kashgais who may at different times be dissatisfied with Sirdar Ihtesham’s repres sive measures or his efforts to collect taxes. Even if Sowlet-ed-Dowleh’s natural timidity lead him to make dishonourable submission or to retire to an equally dishonourable exile, Sirdar Ihtesham cannot hope, without strong Government support, to control his tribes effectively. The Chiefs who have helped to place him in power realise now too clearly the weakness of the authorities, and an Ilkhani’s control of his tribes has always been dependent on the _ Kalantars* res pect for the Government behind their Chieftain. Nevertheless, Sirdar Ihtesham’s accession has, for the moment, greatly lessened the more serious dangers of the situation in Pars, and it may, if external influences do not again intervene to prejudice the good work accomplished, contribute towards an amelioration of the state of the province. The condition of the Khamseh tribes is even less encouraging. These mixed elements are, at any time, much more difficult to manage than the^ ■^ as ^’ gais, who are less savage, more chary of revolt owing to their w r ealth in lands and flocks, more amenable to their Chiefs, more homogeneous, than the Khamseh tribesmen. The latter are divided by perpetual quarrels, by frequent inter-tribal hostilities. They are now in a chronic state ot insubordination, and, though most of them are, on occasion, ready to fight for Kawam-ul-Mulk, they will at present not respond to his injunctions against their freebooting exploits. Indeed,2 i they plunder Kawam-ul-Mulk’s own estates as thoroughly as those of oth^r lanrf owner. They have made the Ispahan postal road impaLable pniaged the mof; defenceless villages in the neighbourhood of that route between Zerghan and ^tencv CU T S -° Ur - ™ rthern teIe g r aph wires with irritating per- s stency. In Darab, Fesa, Ninz, right away to the Kerman border, they 8 have almost expropriated the unfortunate landowners. Wandering bands of Arab? Basens and Baharloos under their own chiefs or brigands like Shaikh Zacharteh’ plunder on a large scale in three provinces. Nasr-ed-Dowleh’s administration of the Khamseh tribes has come to an inglorious close at anv ra e for til present with the execution of Reza Kuli Khan, reported in my telegram No ro of April ist last. Although this predatory Arab Chief richly ’'deserved his fan? his exeeufo' a ra ^ mo p portune in view of the then hi ; ed h,s fa J e &gt; to accent ti' e ?v 0Wleh - , Kawa ™-“''Mulk, however, was perhaps ill-advised fot mihHrWd 'ofcompli and support his son. Instead of doing this he publicly disowned Nasr-ed-Dowleh with the result that the Khamseh Chiefs re covering from the salutary fear inspired by this execution, became even more ' n J ab n ° f rd ‘ nat ®, than Previously. Kawam-ul-Mulk has now assumed the Governor! ship of he Khamseh tribes himself and would like to go out to restore order among them, but it is doubtful whether he can be spared from ° xif loss of the late Nasr-ed-Dowleh is now bein! keenly Wt for h s nre!e - The the Khamseh tribes would be invaluable a?

There is some talk of the appointment of Nasir-ed-Diwan as Gover nor of JKazeroun, of which he is now Kalantar. Khurshid Khan, who has a bitter feud with Muhammad Ali Khan and the Kashkulis since the unprovoked attack on Kamanj last year, has just paid a visit to Nasir-ed-Diwan at Kazeroun. There are rumours of a combination between Kamarij and Kazeroun to eject the Kashgais from the Shapur villages, which formerly belonged to Khurshid, and to secure a reversion of the traffic to the main road. This road, however, cannot be opened without the consent of the Kashgais, and the more prudent among their adversaries, recognising this, are trying to negotiate for a friendly settlement. Natural causes may, however, bring about the reversion to the main road, for the Naudan route is ill-supplied with fodder and animal disease is very prevalent on it during the hot weather. Already several large caravans, which came up the main road, have arrived at Shiraz. There is, however, at present a block of caravans, waiting at different points for a settlement of the road controversy. The bad relations existing between the Kashgais and the settled population along the road is productive of much uncertainty and greatly aggravates the difficulties of traffic. It is very possible that the latter, to secure the passage of traffic through their lands, may obtain the acquiescence of the Kashgais for a monetary consideration, which of course will in the end be paid by the muleteers in increased rahdari. Already the rates of mule hire are prohibitive. I have been able, owing to the effective assistance of Kawam-ul*Mulk and the personally friendly attitude of the Kashgai Khans towards the Consulate, to pass a few European travellers up and down the road, north and south of Shiraz, but the arrangements for such journeys involve for me an amount of labour and* anxiety which is extremely trying. All my efforts cannot ensure such travellers against violent insults and blackmail on the part of the road-guards. I may mention that, to enable European travellers to pass in relative safety along the Bushire road, I am compelled to entrust them to the Chiefs implicated in the • attacks on our troops. For instance, Ardeshir Khan, the young Kashkuli Chief, who, after, as I strongly suspect, having shot me, picked me up on the field of battle and tended me with such genial kindness (see my telegram No. 10 of January 8th last) has, in his endeavours to placate me, twice personally escorted up and down the road European travellers, whom I have been compelled to entrust to the care of the Kashkuli Khans. Only a saving sense of humour can enable a British Agent to maintain his equanimity under such conditions. Away from the main road the province is, in great part, no longer even under the nominal control of the Government. Shiraz is mainly a distributing centre for the outlying districts, especially Fesa, Darab, Ear, as well as for Ispahan and Yezd. Pedlars scarcely ever venture out into the districts, which are closed to all regular trade from Shiraz. The north road, as already indicat ed, is only fitfully open to caravan traffic. General congestion of stocks and commercial stagnation are the results of this closure of the outlets for Shiraz trade. Order has been satisfactorily maintained in the Shiraz valley for the last six months, and the tribal migration has happily passed without any incident in con nection with our troops. This has been due to the able administration of Kawam ul-Mulk and the appeasement, through the accession of Sirdar Ihtesham, of the strife between the Kashgais and the Kawamis. This strife was aggravated and given an appearance of permanence by Sowlet-ed-Dowleh for the purposes of his vindictive hostility against the Kawami family. The results of his eclipse have, I hope, shown that there is no permanent, bitter hostility between that family and the Kashgais or between the latter and the Khamseh tribes. The Kashgai and the Kawami interests of course clash at times, but the fact that Khamseh and Kashgai tribesmen fought side by side against Sowlet-ed-Dowleh and the present friendly, respectful attitude of the Kashgai Chiefs towards Kawam-ul-Mulk prove that these interests can be brought into harmony. This * harmony, though it may be disturbed again by ill-advised action on the part of the Persian authorities or by other causes, has given us peace in the Shiraz valley during this spring. In the maintenance of this harmony lies the only hope of salvation through native efforts.Having summarily and moderately described the present unsatisfactory situation in Pars, I venture to offer a few remarks regarding the possibilities of the future, firstly, as regards our own position in the province, and, secondly, as regards the prospects of a tolerable restoration of order by the Persian Govern ment. Our own position in Pars has been radically changed by recent development. As long as our soldiers in Shiraz were limited to a number which, in Persian eyes, could pass for a Consular escort, there was no native animosity against them. As soon, however, as the number of our soldiers here reached the propor tions of a military force, the apprehensions of the lawless elements in the province were aroused. Sooner or later these apprehensions were bound to take the form of opposition. This opposition, which manifested itself in the attacks on our troops north and south of Kazeroun, has, in the absence of any attempt at vindication on our part, been very embarrassing to the Consulate. Hitherto His Majesty’s Consul, when the local authorities failed him was able by friendly communications with the tribal chiefs to protect his countrymen. It has now become exceedingly difficult for him to cultivate friendly relations with tribesmen who are in manifest opposition to His Majesty’s troops. In fact, his advantageous position of friendly neutrality is jeopardised. The Ilkhani and the Kashgai Chiefs have shewn every desire for friendly relations with me. Sirdar Ihtesham, before his departure northwards, sent me a most cordial letter, protesting his friendship and presents which I of course courteously refused. I have reported by telegraph the effective measures he took, in reply to my private representations, to protect our southern telegraph wires. Muhammad AH Khan and the Kashguli and Farsimadan chiefs made similar protestations and invited me to pay them a visit in their summer quarters. In view of their share in the attacks on His Majesty’s troops, I am unable to respond very heartily to their advances. 1 cannot, however, in our present precarious position, afford to ignore altogether Chiefs who control the Bushire road and might, if they wished, make much trouble for us in the Shiraz valley itself. I continue, therefore, to acknowledge their advances with moderate enthusiasm, laying stress on the fact that my attitude is due to the kindliness with which they treated me personally, when I fell wounded into tKeir hands, and is conditional on the prompt surrender of the culprits of the attacks on our troops. This compromise cannot last indefinitely, and when I can no longer keep up the pretence of believing that they wfill accord us the reparation demanded, I am at a loss to conceive how, without loss of dignity to His Majesty’s Government, I shall be able safely to regulate my relations with the Kashgai Chiefs. At present they are all prodigal of promises of satisfaction, alleging that the delay has been due to the critical tribal situation. Muhammad Ali Khan stated that, until the question of Sowlet-ed-Dowdeh was settled, he could not punish a single shepherd in his tribe. They all declared that the guilty parties have fled to Sowdet-ed-Dowleh or elsewhere out of reach for the present, but they are quite unable to explain, except by grotesque excuses, the escape of the culprits who were under arrest in Muhammad Ali Khan’s camp at Shapur, when I w r as his guest there. Even supposing that the Chiefs have nothing to fear from awkward relations, I doubt whether they would now, except under some very real menace, risk alienating the sympathies of their adherents by the surrender of the culprits. I am of course pressing them in every possible manner, both directly and through Kawam-ul-Mulk. Hitherto the Consulate v r as universally respected by the tribes as the symbol of a great power, and its representations were generally received with deference. It is true that its inability, owing to the prevailing anarchy, to obtain satisfaction for the claims of British subjects, the recurrence of unpunished attacks on British travellers, had somewhat diminished the Consulate’s authority. Yet His Majesty’s Consul still represented an incalculable pow r er, which the tribesmen w r ere reluctant to offend, especially as they had no quarrel with an official whose role was mainly confined to that of an impartial spectator. All this is being changed. Our troops have come and been attacked twice with , impunity. His Majesty’s Consulate cannot hope to retain long the respect which the tribesmen, vaguely apprehensive of the unknown possibilities of England’s displeasure, still entertained for it. The ignorant tribesman naturally argues that England, dissatisfied with his depredations, has sent a military forceto Fars. He has been able to attack that force with impunity and, as he thinks, with success. He can only attribute our subsequent inaction to impotence or fear. Nasrullah Khan, British Vice-Consul at Kerman, whose distressful journey to Shiraz I have reported by telegraph, told me that far away on the Kerman border Arabs and Baharloos spoke to him with exultant insolence of the now famous attacks on our troops and, confident in their own martial superiority, with contempt of the possibility of successful reprisals on our part. I have already reported on the Kashgai attitude in this respect. Muhammad Ali Khan, during the pleasant evenings I spent lying wounded in his tent, displayed a similar, though more courteous, exultation, and the most that his vanity would admit was that our troops were perhaps able to meet Persians in the plains. He was convinced of the superiority of his tribesmen in hill warfare. It is evident, therefore, that no solution of the present difficulty other than our rehabilitation by British arms can regain the tribal respect previously enter tained for us. If our troops are withdrawn after the exaction by the Persian authorities of adequate reparation from the offending tribe, our former position would not be recovered thereby, though we could doubtless continue to exist here with some profit to our commercial and political interests. If our troops were withdrawn without the exaction of adequate reparation, the Consulate’s influence would be completely destroyed. British subjects would be exposed to much contemptuous discourtesy on the part of the natives and would depend for protec tion on the goodwill of the local authorities, who perhaps could be influenced by the Central Government under pressure from His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran. It is doubtful wffiether British firms would find much profit in continuing their business under such conditions. It is still more doubtful whether the services I could then render to His Majesty’s Government or British residents would justify the expense of maintaining a Consulate here. If it is finally decided that, in order to restore a measure of our former influence here, armed intervention is inevitable, it might take the form of a punitive expedition to punish the Kashkulis, with the intention of immediate withdrawal as soon as this specific object was accomplished. I do not believe that such an expedition would be difficult, even if the Kashkulis were supported by the majority of the other Kashgai tribes. My experience of nomad tribes in Persia, and specially of the Kashgais, does not lead me to share the view regard ing the ‘ elusive nature ” of such tribes (see Government of India’s telegram of December 29th last). On the contrary, it would seem that nomad tribes in Persia are very vulnerable. They are, from pasture exigencies, compelled to follow definite lines of migration. By occupying certain passes at the proper season we could hold up the Kashgais who, unless they decided on submission, w r ould have either to attack with a view to forcing a passage or to resign them selves to the destruction of their flocks from starvation. The trouble would not be in the accomplishment of such punitive measures but in limiting their scope and effecting a speedy withdrawal afterwards. In the course of such an expedition elements other than those we had set out to punish might be drawn into the hostilities. We would be assisted by friendly natives, whom we would, on withdrawal, have to abandon to possible reprisals. Our punitive action would create on the road a state of security which would be destroyed by premature withdrawal. Merchant classes, British and Persian, would probably clamour for the retention of our troops, would no doubt discover excellent reasons to support their appeals. British local Agents would find themselves exceedingly embarrassed to assume the responsibility for recommending a withdrawal at any particular moment. I need not enlarge on the obvious difficulties which, as experience has shown elsewhere, would militate against the limitation of such military action and the subsequent withdrawal of foreign troops introduced into an independent country, where British subjects have to remain after the departure of our soldiers. Armed intervention might again frankly assume the form of occupation, which would of course be a more arduous and more costly enterprise. It might be possible to render such occupation temporary by the formation of a native gendarmarie under British officers and the a:gis of our troops, which would be gradually withdrawn as the local force became efficient. Needless to say, similar difficulties would probably impede the withdrawal of an occupying army as in the case of a punitive force.6 If, however, armed intervention is negatived as contrary to our interests, our troops may have to stay here for a considerable time. Their continued sojourn at Shiraz under present conditions has many inconveniences. Incidents, for which we might very probably be unable to obtain satisfaction, are always possible. Experience seems to show that in Persia after grave occurrences, such as the attacks on our troops, there follows generally a period of expectant quiescence. As, however, this apprehensive mood wears off, the boldness of the lawless elements tends to increase. Any change for the worse in the present precarious peace so dexterously maintained by Kawam-ul-Mulk would greatly increase the danger of incidents in connection with our troops. Moreover, so large a force cannot, without danger of ridicule, be kept here inactive indefinitely, while tribal depredations against our telegraph wires and British caravans are going on iust outside of Shiraz. I presume that the withdrawal of our troops is conditional on the establishment of some authority at Shiraz strong enough to obtain adequate reparation for the attacks on our cavalry and to maintain partial order in Ears. The prospects of a restoration of order by the Persian Government are not very hopeful. The gendarmerie alone cannot be effective for such a purpose. Before the gendarmerie can be put out on the road, a settlement of the tribal question is imperative. The experiment, apparently contemplated for next autumn, of spreading 600 gendarmes along the road from Kazeroun to Sivend, is impracticable. The Kashgais, who draw a regular income from rahdharij are unlikely to surrender the road willingly, and they could make the task of these 600 gendarmes quite impossible. Double their number over the same distance could not succeed with the tribes in their present predominant position. We can only hope, with any assurance, from the gendarmerie that, after many mistakes, many failures in recruitment, after much dearly bought experience, it may, not in six months but in a few years, constitute a regular force, similar’ though probably inferior, to the Cossack brigade, which a strong Governor, with moderate financial support, could use in co-operation with irregular troops for successful punitive measures against the tribes. Once the tribes had been thus chastised, it would be possible for the gendarmerie to take over the road. The important question, then, is the establishment of a strong adminis trative authority at Shiraz. ^ I venture to suggest tentatively that it might be worth our while to assist in this work by money lent to the local authority direct. Experience^ seems to show that money lent to the Central Government is always misapplied in connection with Pars. The man on the spot has a much clearer perception of the necessities of the situation, and though his misappropriation of public funds is unlikely to be less extensive than in the case of the Tehran Government, he would probably use the money actually spent on public service to better purpose than the ignorant Central Administration. For instance, it is unlikely that a sensible Governor, however much he might rob the public purse, would waste money on a ludicrous force, such as that sent, at great expense, by the Persian Government last year, to restore order in Pars. We have seen hovy cleverly Kawam-ul-Mulk has eked out, for the successful maintenance of order in the Shiraz valley, the insignificant sums received from lehran this year. The Treasurer-General might appoint a competent European Financial Agent to control the expenditure of such local loans in a manner similar to that employed by Monsieur Mornard at Tehran. In this manner it might conceivably be possible to build up a local Government which self- contained and independent of the vicissitudes of an unstable Central’Government could maintain a tolerable measure of order in Pars. At present the only competent local authority at Shiraz is Kawam-ul-Mulk whose successful and prudent management of the critical situation here has done much to remove the prejudices entertained against him. If the Persian Government are able to send us a suitable Governor-General, he would, I 1 111 \ j 6 W f '^ c l vise d to utilise Kawam-ul-Mulk, who, with his unrivalled knowledge of Pars his power over the Ilkhani and the Kashgai Chiefs, his influence among the Khamseh tribes and in the province generally, is perhaps the only man who today can hope to do anything effective towards the restora- lon o order. He is essentially a Government man, and he can never go into ppen rebellion for his power is bound up with that of the Government. He has, «moreover^ owing to the damage inflicted on his large vested interests by the anarchy in Pars, everything to gain by a restoration of order. I confess that I am sceptical of Governors sent from Tehran who endeavour, in the present im potence of the Government, to govern against the Kawami interest. They come and go, but Kawam-ul-Mulk remains, the most stable, the most accessible power amidst the general chaos of the province. I would view with apprehension the removal of this last element of stability in the general dissolution of Pars. A local magnate of such power is of course often embarrassing to the Government, but the Persian Government today are too weak to stand on their own legs in Pars. 1 hey must lean on local support and put up with the inconvenience involved in such dependence. In order to secure Kawam-ul-Mulk’s whole-hearted co-operation with a Governor-General or a more fearless, a more energetic and effective administra tion of the province, if he is to be left in charge of Pars, some means must be found to tranquilise his personal apprehensions, his well-founded distrust of his own Government and people, to counteract his discouragement in the face of the prevailing pessimism regarding the future of Pars under Persian administration. It is this personal nervousness, this uncertainty, this discouragement, which impedes the boldness of his present administrative action and might embarrass him in future co-operation with a Governor-General. Once he felt that his per sonal position was secure from the possible malignity of Persian officialdom and that he was sure of a refuge against the dangers resulting from a final failure to restore order by Persian efforts, he would probably display a much bolder and more effective energy in administering the province or would co-operate unre servedly with a Governor-General’s administration. As far as I can see, the only way to tranquilise his personal fears would be for us to give him some sort of assurance. We might, for instance, without assuming any definite responsibility for him, assure him that, as long as he co-operated loyally with the Persian Govern ment, he could count on'our diplomatic support at Tehran and our moral support locally in Pars. I am quite alive to the possible inconveniences of such assurances to Oriental potentates, subject to varying fortunes and always more or less untrustworthy. Had I any hope that the Central Government would be able, in the near future, to assert its authority successfully in Pars by an independent policy, I would strongly deprecate our supporting any local power in the province. Such support, among other drawbacks, deprives us of the advantage which our traditional policy of neutrality has so often given us. But we are today face to face with a grave problem, which cannot be solved by inaction on our part. I would welcome with relief any other practical, less inconvenient, suggestion. Fail- ling any such proposal, I venture to offer the suggestion, for your consideration, and with full conscience of its inconveniences, that it might be worth our while to support Kawam-ul-Mulk with some such assurances as those indicated above. If, without armed intervention, we wish to secure the punishment of the assailants of His Majesty’s troops and a tolerable measure of order in Pars, we must take some risks. Today no Persian except Kawam-ul-Mulk has any chance of obtain ing the reparation we demand, and he is unlikely to take the serious risks which extreme measures would involve for his own position, without some assurance of our support. He may of course fail to obtain adequate reparation for us, to restore order in the measure requisite for the withdrawal of our troops. His failure, especially after our partisanship of him, would still further increase the difficulties of our position here. If, however, we do not support Kawam-ul-Mulk, for the furtherance of the two specific aims just mentioned, we must, it would seem, remain inactive spectators of the increasing anarchy in Pars, hoping for the unexpected, with our troops immobilised here under the most unsatisfactory con ditions conceivable for a British military force on foreign soil. By giving such assurances to Kawam-ul Mulk, we could bring great pressure to bear on him, if he begun to show signs of indulging in his notorious obstructive methods. This pressure would be especially useful in the question of the gendar merie. In the present anarchy this force cannot be a success without the co operation of the local authorities, who, unless constrained are sure to be obstruc tive. They naturally object to the expenditure on such a force of funds which otherwise might contribute to line their own pockets. Apart, moreover, from motives of disappointed greed, the creation of a power under European officers,8 r K ' who claim complete independence of the provincial Government and reject Its jurisdiction is, even under normal conditions, certain to provoke the opposition of the local authorities. I have already reported on the difficulties continually arising between Major Siefvert and Kawam-ul-MuIk. These difficulties are due partly to the above causes and partly to the Major’s ignorance of Oriental and local conditions, but they are especially serious owing to Kawam-ul-Mulk’s apprehensions, caused by the imprudent enlistment of his bitterest enemies, that the force is intended to be directed against himself. He frankly told my Mirza on one occasion that, if he could be assured of our support, he would not object to the enlistment of his enemies on a large scale. Your are of course aware of Kawam-ul-Mulk’s consistently friendly attitude towards us. Unlike Sowlet-ed* Dowleh, whose effusive protestations of friendship were never translated into corresponding acts, Kawam-ul-Mulk has been sparing of words but eloquent in deeds. I am inclined to think that those who, from outside of Fars, appear to contemplate with equanimity the removal of Kawam- ul-Mulk, do not perhaps fully realise what would have been our plight here during the last six months, what it might be in the immediate future, without the cordial and powerful co-operation of this shy, silent man, who with a quite un-Persian lack of effusion, has supported us steadily in the face of nationalist, priestly and tribal opposition. I need not lay stress on his assistance in facilitating the movements of our troops generally on their way to Shiraz and the withdrawal from a perilous position at Kazeroun of the detachments attacked by Kashgais. in obviating incidents at Shiraz in connection with our troops, in smoothing away the many petty difficulties which, especially under present conditions, must continually arise in the relations between our soldiers and the townsmen, in expe diting, to the best of his limited power, the current affairs of the Consulate. I do not wish to attribute this attitude to disinterested motives or to overlook Kawam-ul-Mulk’s obvious failings. He has little faith in his own Government, and he certainly believes that a day will come w r hen England will reassert her old position in Fars. Doubtless he hopes that then we will not forget the services he has rendered in our hour of need. I am also quite aware that Kawam-ul- Mulk, much as he desires a restoration of order, wants it to be brought about in conformity with his own interests. If he thought that the policy being followed for the restoration of order was contrary to his own interests, he would un doubtedly be obstructive again I only contend that, unless the Central Govern ment have the arms, the men and the money necessary for an independent policy, they must rely on local instruments, whose interests must obviously be respected. I cannot see where they can find a more serviceable instrument than Kawam-ul- Mulk, who, moreover, has the advantage of being very friendly to us. I have not discussed, as a possible solution, the scheme for subsidizing the tribes, as 1 gather that it has been abandoned. I have previously ventured to express my views regarding this scheme, which seems to me, under present conditions, impracticable and dangerous. Besides destroying the last vestige of the Government’s authority in the province, it would probably involve us in countless petty feuds and might before long render occupation on a large scale inevitable. The tribal chiefs are too irresponsible, too unreliable, too inaccessible, to be easily amenable to our dictation, unsupported by armed force. Moreover, the present insolent spirit of the tribes would render negotiations for such a scheme almost impossible, uuless we were prepared to make drastic threats, which, in case of necessity, would have to be executed. I understand that on the North-West frontier of India we established systems of subsidization after having previously defeated the natives in war and inspired them with a salutary respect for our power, which, moreover, as they are aware, is ever ready to strike again, if necessary. I have not discussed the question of the prevention cf the import of arms and ammunition into Fars, as this is a matter of obvious importance and of more concern to His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Bushire. Any effective preventative measures of this kind would of course powerfully contribute to the restoration of order in Fars. At present there is a great scarcity of cartridges at Shiraz, but this scarcity has hitherto chiefly embarrassed the Government, which has latterly been compelled to purchase cartridges at the enormous priceof 2 Krans each. The tribes appear to be still well supplied with ammunition, though even among them complaints are heard of the difficulties now experienced in replenishing their stock. In concluding this lengthy despatch with apologies for having encroached so far on your valuable time, I would lay stress on the very speculative nature of any suggestions for, or consideration of the possibilities of, a restoration of order in Pars through native efforts. No one, with much experience of this kaleidoscopic country, can venture to sound the future with any assurance, except on very general lines. The general tendency in Pars has been from bad to worse, and any efforts now made to Stem the tide of disorder, without foreign intervention, can only be in the nature of forlorn hopes. In the end, the chances are that we shall have to face the alternative of the occupation or the evacuation of Pars. It is even possible that, if the decision has to be postponed too long, we may not have this choice and that occupation may by force of circumstances become inevitable.

From—The Political Resident, Bushire, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. Only since my return to headquarters have I seen Smart’s despatch to you, No. 9-Confidential. Since then both the possibility that the Zil-es-Sultan might return, and the imminence of the departure from Tehran for Pars of the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh, have formed the subject of telegraphic discussion. I presume therefore that the suggestion of His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, that Kawam-ul-Mulk should be retained as Governor-General and should receive our support is not for the moment on the tapis. Prima facie, to give active backing to any of the rival factions in Pars is opposed to our policy’ and in any case there is considerable diversity of opinion as to their respective merits. I am nevertheless not prepared to say that circumstances might not exist which would justify action by us on the lines suggested by Smart, if we were prepared to do so thoroughly. I would beg, however, that without full ventila tion of the pros and cons, both general and local, no definite decision may be come to in that direction, and that when the time comes an opportunity of expressing my views, having regard to the situation and outlook at the moment, may be afforded me. In the meantime, I confess that I am very sceptical as to whether, judging from recent indications, the situation will in any way be improved or simplified by the advent of the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh. I am sending a copy of the foregoing to His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, by post.[B] PERSIA. [January 16.] CONFIDENTIAL. h \ ' V Section 4. [2184] No. 1. (Secret.) War Office to Foreign Office.—(Received January 16.) 1HE Director of Military Operations presents his compliments to the Under secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and, in reply to his memorandum of the 2nd instant, begs to forward the enclosed paper embodying an expression of the opinion asked for. Whitehall, January 15, 1912. 1. THE Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs desires an early expression of military opinion as to — (1.) The policy to be pursued in view of the present situation in Southern Persia • o ri * (2.) The military action required to give effect to the policy advocated. 2. It is presumed that the general policy of the British Government under the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1907 is to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, with due legald to the maintenance of peace and order in certain provinces of that country in which Great Britain and Russia respectively have special interests. It is further understood that, owing to the internal condition of Persia, it was lately found necessary to dispatch a native cavalry regiment from India to protect the British consulate at Shiraz ; and that, owing to a recent attack on Mr. Smart and the detachment escorting him to Shiraz, and also having regard to the attitude of the tribesmen in Southern Persia and the weakness of the Persian Government, military action on our part may now be called for. . Bearing in mind that, though Shiraz lies in the “neutral zone” outside the British sphere of influence, British interests have always predominated there, and that the Persian Government are—and for some time to come may be—incapable of controlling the country or of exacting reparation for the attack on Mr. Smart and his escort, the following alternatives appear to be open to us :— (a.) To maintain our position in Southern Persia by dispatching a force capable of occupying Shiraz, and of keeping our communications open between Shiraz and Bushire ; or (6.) Temporarily to abandon our position in the western part of Southern Persia, by closing the consulates at Shiraz and elsewhere, and withdrawing them, their escorts, and British subjects (including the officers of the Indo-European Telegraph Department) to the coast. 3. While the maintenance of our position in the west of Southern Persia must involve military difficulties and expenditure in addition to such political disadvantages as are inseparable from military intervention, these disadvantages may be outweighed by the political, commercial, and military disadvantages attendant on an abandonment —even of a temporary nature—of our position in that region. The abandonment of our position in the west of Southern Persia— Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting Military Action in Southern Persia. (Secret.) [2329 q—i ]fr'WMi ***—* (1.) Might mean a serious loss of prestige, both in Persia itself and the East generally^^iid ^ ^ trade and trade connection, possibly permanently ; _ (3) Would give Russia an opportunity and a pretext for the military occupation of the neutral zoSe of Southern Persia to “ protect ” threatened interests and consulates. She would thus gain in prestige, and to a great extent m trade, what we should lose. She has considerable military forces already m Northern Persia, and could quickly seize her opportunity; . .. . j + (4.) Might also give other Powers a similar opening, to our detriment, _ (5.) Might give Russia an opportunity of obtaining an outlet on the leisian (auii, which it has hitherto been our policy to deny her. The attainment of an outlet on the seaboard of South-west Persia might be of great political and military advantage to Russia he^Quid ; n j ts being very difficult, if not impossible, for Great Britain to regain her former commercial position in South-west Persia, if that part of the country were once dominated by another Power. There is understood to be little likelihood of the Russian Government withdrawing its troops from Northern Persia till the country is settled and the Persian Government is itself able to maintain order. Even then it is not impossible that a variety o circumstances, fortuitous or otherwise, might indefinitely prolong the time deemed necessary by Russia for the retention of her troops m Persia. . If in existing circumstances, Great Britain temporarily abandons her &lt; interests in the neutral zone^she would have but little, if any, voice subsequently m putting a limit to the period of the occupation of that region by the troops of other Powers. Nor could she well protest against any measures adopted by such Powers to protect their own interests in Southern Persia, however disadvantageous such action might be to her hereafter. , „ i . * Havino- once withdrawn, it would be difficult for the British consulates to be re-established till reparation had been exacted for the late attacks, and order restored in the neutral zone; but it is possible that the Persian Government may not be m a position, or may refuse, to take the necessary action. 4. To maintain our position in South-western Persia it would seem necessary (a.) To ensure the immediate safety of the British consulates and their escorts, as well as British subjects at Shiraz and elsewhere in the neutral zone ; . . (b.) To take such action as may safeguard our interests and_ prestige m the disturbed area till such time as the Persian Government can itself maintain order. It is stated on the authority of Mr .Acting Consul G. G. Knox, that in March there will be some 15,000 armed tribesmen in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, while m a later telegram the same officer estimates the number of tribesmen m Pars at from 50,000 5. Recent events have shown the risks attendant upon the employment of small detachments of troops in the present disturbed state of the country. Local Persians are themselves of opinion that serious ^ disorders amongst the Kasho-ais, and possibly other tribes, are practically inevitable in the spring, whilst the reports received from our own representatives in Shiraz point to the necessity of pur beino- prepared for a serious outbreak of hostile feeling amongst the tribesmen, which, even^if it does not vent itself in an actual attack upon our troops, might render their position at Shiraz extremely precarious owing to the ease with which communication with the coast could be interrupted and supplies cut off. Bearing in mind the nature and strength of the opposition that may possibly have to be encountered, the length of communications to be maintained (182 miles) m a mountainous country, and the question of supply and transport, it is estimated that a considerable force would be required in the event of its being decided to take military action. It is not yet known how many of the local tribes were concerned m the attack on Mr. Smart’s escort, but from the fact that Major Birdwood has been able to join hands with Colonel Douglas without any further fighting taking place, it may be inferred that there is not as yet any organised tribal revolt. It is not possible to forecast with any accuracy the force that may ultimately be required, but it would seem imprudent to attempt the task of safeguarding Shiraz, making good the lines of communication, and carrying out such punitive operations as may be found necessary with a smaller force than— A seiTwo mixed brigades of infantry, each to include a pioneer battalion; Two Indian cavalry regiments, including the one already in Southern Persia ; Two or more batteries of mountain artillery ; One field company of sappers and miners, with the necessary administrative services. 6. It would also seem advisable to prevent the import of arms and ammunition into Persia by the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea. 7. Owing to the time necessary for preliminary arrangements, and for the dispatch and concentration of troops, transport, and supplies, and the likelihood of the country becoming increasingly disturbed in the spring, and in order to prevent the possibility of another Power forestalling us on the plea that their interests were not being safeguarded, it seems important that if military action is to be taken at all, it should be taken promptly. 8. Opportunity might perhaps be, taken to improve the trade routes by military and hired labour, and even to train a local gendarmerie force. This would involve considerable expenditure. It might also be possible to carry out investigations in connection with railway routes. 9. ^Finally, it must be understood that from a military standpoint the permanent occupation by British or Indian troops of any part of the neutral zone is not recommended. The action now suggested would be of a purely temporary nature.From Viceroy, 3(M December 1911. Foreign Secret Shiraz incident. The telegrams that have reached the Government ol India from Shiraz and Bushire shew that what was foreseen as not unlikely has now happened, and that the detachments of Indian cavalry sent to Shiraz and Ispahan have been attacked by tribesmen with some loss (?) and that a force of 100 cavalry are in a precarious position at iiazerun. It is satisfactory to note that Consul Smart lias only been wounded, and appears to be in safety in a caravanserai. Question now arises as to what action is to be taken. First, obvious suggestion is to land a battalion ol infantry at Bushire to hold town in pledge until the Persian Government have taken effective measures to inflict condign punishment upon the tribesmen who attacked the British cavalry. The Customs should be seized and retained, and surplus over what is due for the service loans should be kept as a contribution towards claim to be made upon the Persian Government. Disembarkation of infantry would free ship now guarding the poit, and would permit a blockade of coast which would create an uncomfortable situation for the tribesmen, and prevent their renewing their supplies of ammunition. This is very essential if/measures are to be taken, /uMv^-cnr and we consider that the despatch of a battalion of infantry should be proceeded with at once. Question then arises as to whether any punitive measures should be undertaken against the offending tribes. Government of India consider that ^u-c&amp; measures would be eventually difficult and hazardous owing to elusive nature of tribes and to precipitous character of country. Moreover, they could only be undertaken by a large held force with a considerable amount of transport. There is, however, a further contingency which must be foreseen, viz., that even when the detachment at Kazerun has succeeded in returning to Shiraz, it is possible that main force at Shiraz will find itself in an entirely isolated position involving a certain amount of danger. It would then become necessary to relieve the detachment, and to effect this without running new risks a force of at least 5,000 men would be required consisting of four regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and two mountain batteries. Should the Government of India be reluctantly compelled by force of circumstances, and in pursuit of a policy to which they have from the outset been opposed, to send a force of this size to relieve detachment of cavalry at|Shiraz, they are strongly of opinion that force should return to the coast from Shiraz with the least possible delay, and should bring away with them the cavalry detachments from Ispahan and Shiraz, members of Consulate, and any British subjects who might desire to avail themselves of British troops as escort to leave Shiraz. Main body of troops could then return to India, and Bushire could be held by a battalion of infantry until satisfactory redress has been received from Persian Government. We are not in favour of sending a regiment of infantry and battery of artillery to Shiraz, since the despatch of this inadequate force would present risks that should be avoided. If, as we have proposed, a battalion of infantry is to be despatched to Bushire, we should be glad of early orders.rm ft lift—Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley (Tehran).

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received August 30, ll'lo a.m.) ' lltf' {No. 487.) ^ Tehran, August 30, 1912, ri5 a.m. 1 HAVE just received, and am repeating 1 to Shiraz for Colonel Douglas’s views, telegram from Government of India referred to in your telegram No. 538 of 26th August. I would venture to submit that there are, in my opinion, serious objections to scheme suggested by the Viceroy of India. It would rouse, I think, all the worst passions of the tribesmen and excite fanatical resentment, as its object would be misunderstood and misrepresented. Under present conditions I doubt whether consul and British subjects at Shiraz are in any danger, but after the withdrawal situation of the force left there might well be a critical one. Existing difficulty of passing reliefs down road would largely be increased, and the new Governor-General’s task would be rendered vastly more difficult. I am firmly convinced that ultimate result would be an expedition on a larger scale and of more permanent nature. I share opinion expressed in your telegram that the force should be large enough to undertake punitive measures if necessary, but I would go further and respectfully suggest that an expedition, if sent at all, should be punitive. I fear that such a step would entail disruption of Persia, but I am doubtful if a half-measure of the nature proposed would be less disastrous. Should it be decided to take military action, I would beg to support the views expressed by British consul-general at Bushire (see my telegram No. 403 of 7 th July) that the Kazerun Valley should be held until such time as the gendarmerie can take over the road and the abuses of rahdari have been regulated. I am well aware that hopes founded upon a nerr Governor-General have proved fallacious in the past, but I would venture to call attention to my telegram No. 463 of 19th August, which crossed your telegram No. 495 of 19th August. New Governor-General is now nearing Ispahan, and should reach Shiraz in ten or twelve days. I have some faith in him if he feels himself strongly supported by His Majesty’s Government. Kawam-ul-Mulk should leave Ears, and no bast should be given on any consideration to a political refugee. In your telegram last quoted you ask my opinion as to financing the Governor- General direct. I have considered this question carefully, and think that such action might have excellent results. Of the 10,000L recently advanced, 10,000 tomans were paid to the Governor-General to enable him to start and about 20,000 tomans remain in hand for his use on arrival. Were he given from 2,000Z. to 3,000Z. a-month for a year he could make sure of a valuable military force which would enable him to maintain order. At the end of a year he should have established himself firmly in the province and be in a position to collect all the revenue necessary for the wants of his administration. I would suggest that the money might be paid through the treasurer- general to his agent in Shiraz and handed to the governor in concert with British consul. By this means Persian susceptibilities might be safeguarded in a measure, while none of the money would find its way into the pockets of certain pilfering Ministers. I would suggest that no steps be taken in this sense until we have had time to realise the effects of the military operations if it is decided to undertake them.

Tehran, September 1, I9i2, 3*30 p.m. FOLLOWING from consular officer at Shiraz, 31st August:— “ Following from Colonel Douglas :— “ ‘ 1 consider that the force proposed would, under present conditions, be sufficient to carry out the measures suggested in Government of India s telegram, including sending infantry to Shiraz, and even then, once established at Kazerun, they would be strong enough to take offensive action within a limited radius of that town if necessary. I am not a' believer in the lighting qualities of the Persian tribesmen, especially if attacked, and my enquiries lead me to believe that no larger force than 3,000 to 4,000 would probably be collected. I doubt, however, whether any serious opposition would j be offered to a force of the size it is proposed to send. “ ‘ There is, of course, the danger that agitation fostered by the mullahs would rouse fanaticism of the people and create generally hostility towards foreigners. Even in this case both Smart and myself think that inter-tribal dissensions and dislike of leaving their flocks and families would prevent any general combination oi Ivashgai tribes against troops. I am not in a position to give an opinion as to the probable attitude of Dashtistan and Tangistan tribes. I think that in view of the possible con tingencies it would be advisable to have another brigade mobilised either in India or in the Gulf according to circumstances. When once landing of troops commences it should be easier to predict probable attitude of the tribes. “ ‘ Present strength of the infantry detachment here is one British officer and ntty- seven native ranks.’ ” (Reneated to Bushire and Government of India.)’ from For''’-*** Secret+rv, fndkl 3 3 *, 15 AUG 1912 f eceived 30 th) July 1912 .

Deputy Governor of Arabs has telegraphed he cannot manage Arabs any longer unless Kawam comes out. Arabs are breaking our telegraph wires and committing general depredations in Eastern Ears from Fesa to north of Dehbid. Unless something is done quickly Arabs whom Kawam with such difficulty turned back from Yezd territory may spread out there again and into Kerman. I earnestly hope you will be able to persuade Persian Government to authorise Kawam to deal with Arabs as he wishes. If such authorisation is refused, turbulence of Arabs may increase to degree that Governor*General will be powerless to restrain them. No one has better chance against them than Kawam. By our claims against Khamseh and present damage these tribes are inflicting on our wires and commerce we are most interested in matter. I cannot make any useful representations regarding Khamseh delinquencies to local authorities when Central Government prevents action. Muhammad Ali Khan has notified Kawam that he has withdrawn his guards from Naudan route and retired from participation in guardianship of Bushire road. Ali Muhammad Kamariji at Rahdar has informed muleteers they can now go by main road. Kawam fears Muhammad All Khan may now put up robberies on road between Tang-i-Turkan and Pul-i-Abginneh though he has given Kawam assurances to the contrary. From latter place to Shiraz Muhammad Khan and other Kashkuli Khans have assured Kawam they will protect road. Khurshid Khan of Kamarij has been killed by fall from his horse. A party in Kazerun is inciting Khans of Borasjun and Daliki to seize Kamarij. Kashgais also covet Kamarij. Fakher-es«Sultaneh, brother of absentee owner of Kamarij, has telegraphed from Shiraz to principal Kamarijis to guard valley securely until he arrives there to make necessary arrangements. Kawam is in communication with Kalantar of Kazerun with view to finding suitable successor to Khurshid.

India, a copy of despatch No. 9, dated the 23rd May 1912, received from His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, on the subject of the situation in Pars, together with .Now that the tribes have passed Shiraz and I have a little leisure fro continual distractions of the tribal migration, the time would seem opportune for a review of the situation in Fars during the last three months and of its possibil ities for the future. The Kashgai question has of course been the dominant factor in the tribal imbroglio. I have already reported by telegram the details of the typically Persian campaign by which Sowlet-ed-Dowleh was ousted from the Chieftainship of the Kashgai tribes. Phis action of the Persian Government has, as I have previously pointed out, come too late to be really effective. Two years ago the dismissal of Sowlet-ed-Dowleh might have brought about a general restoration of order in the province. Today its effect can only be partial and temporary, unless supported by a Government stronger and more stable than that which has misruled Pars for the last few years. Tribal warfare, unsupported by Govern ment force, is generally inconclusive in Persia, and such force is lacking today. Sowlet-ed-Dowleh may—another Naib Hussein—long roam at large, stirring up disorder, making trouble for the Ilkhani, intriguing with any elements among the Kashgais who may at different times be dissatisfied with Sirdar Ihtesham’s repres sive measures or his efforts to collect taxes. Even if Sowlet-ed-Dowleh’s natural timidity lead him to make dishonourable submission or to retire to an equally dishonourable exile, Sirdar Ihtesham cannot hope, without strong Government support, to control his tribes effectively. The Chiefs who have helped to place him in power realise now too clearly the weakness of the authorities, and an Ilkhani’s control of his tribes has always been dependent on the Kalantars* res pect for the Government behind their Chieftain. Nevertheless, Sirdar Ihtesham’s accession has, for the moment, greatly lessened the more serious dangers of the situation in Fars, and it may, if external influences do not again intervene to prejudice the good work accomplished, contribute towards an amelioration of the state of the province. The condition of the Khamseh tribes is even less encouraging. These mixed elements are, at any time much more difficult to manage than the Kash gais, who are less savage, more chary of revolt owing to their wealth in lands and flocks, more amenable to their Chiefs, more homogeneous, than the Khamseh tribesmen. The latter are divided by perpetual quarrels, by frequent inter-tribal hostilities. They are now in a chronic state ot insubordination, and, though most of them are, on occasion, ready to fight for Kawam-ul-Mulk, they will at present not respond to his injunction: ning exploits. Indeed, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of No. I 75 ’ 743 &gt; dated 2oth July 191a. with. a copy of a telegram which I have sent to His Majesty’s Minister in connection there- SHIRAZ ; 23rd May igi No. 9-Confidential. Sir,2 they plunder Kawam-ul-Mulk’s own estates as thoroughly as those of other land- owners. They have made the Ispahan postal road impassable, pillaged the more defenceless villages in the neighbourhood of that route between Zerghan and Abadeh, and have been cutting our northern telegraph wires with irritating per sistency. In Darab, Fesa, Niriz, right away to the Kerman border, they have almost expropriated the unfortunate landowners. Wandering bands of Arabs, Baseris and Baharloos, under their own chiefs or brigands like Shaikh Zacharieh, plunder on a large scale in three provinces. Nasr-ed-Dowleh’s administration of the Khamseh tribes has come to an inglorious close, at any rate for the present, with the execution of Reza Kuli Khan, reported in my telegram No. 59 of April 1st last. Although this predatory Arab Chief richly deserved his fate, his execution was most inopportune in view of the then approaching struggle with Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. Kawam*ul-Mulk, however, was perhaps ill-advised not to accept the fait accompli and support his son. Instead of doing this he publicly disowned Nasr-ed-Dowleh with the result that the Khamseh Chiefs, re covering from the salutary fear inspired by this execution, became even more insubordinate than previously. Kawam-ul-Mulk has now assumed the Governor ship of the Khamseh tribes himself and would like to go out to restore order among them, but it is doubtful whether he can be spared from Shiraz. The loss of the late Nasr-ed-Dowleh is now being keenly felt, for his presence among the Khamseh tribes would be invaluable at the present moment. Meanwhile, Kawam-ul-Mulk has sent out, as his deputy to the Khamseh tribes, Mirza Fazlullah Khan, better known as Mirza Haji Agha, formerly an adherent of Mutemid-ed-Diwan but now a supporter of Kawam-ul-Mulk. Though perhaps not possessing great authority, he has considerable experience of the Khamseh tribes, and he appears to be a reasonable person. He told melthat his mission would probably be confined to soothing the tribes with fair words until the autumn, when it is hoped that Kawam-ul-Mulk may find leisure to undertake in person the necessary repressive measures. The state of the main road from Bushire to Ispahan is well known to you. The northern section has been closed to caravan traffic since the beginning of March. There has, however, been a distinct improvement on the stretch between Abadeh and the Ispahan frontier. This is perhaps due partly to removal of the incompetent Deputy Governor of Abadeh, Midhat-ul-Mulk, and the appointment in his place of Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashgai (not Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli). This person, who governed Abadeh last year for Sowlet-ed-Dewleh, has adapted himself to the new regime and given satisfaction to the inhabitants of Abadeh by his administration of the district. Probably, however, the chief cause of the amelioration of the Abadeh-Aminabad section is the absence of caravan traffic to attract Kuhgelus and other brigands with the hope of sub stantial booty. A large caravan started up the Sarhad road in the first week of this month, and this route is, in view of the Khamseh depredations on the postal road between Zerghan and Abadeh, likely to be used almost exclusively by caravans during this summer. Caravans have been passing fairly continuously along the southern road, which, however, is in a most unsatisfactory state. The blackmail levied by the road-guards and their barefaced pilfering from caravans have reached unprecedented proportions. The attitude of these road-guards, especially at Rahdar, towards European, travellers is disgraceful. Apart from being heavily blackmailed, European travellers must expect to be treated with violent discourtesy, even threatened with pointed rifles, by these servants of the Kashkuli Khans, who are the wardens of this road. This aggravated dis courtesy towards Europeans is undoubtedly due to the effect produced among tribesmen by the impunity of the recent attacks on His Majesty’s troops. As reported in my telegram No. 55 of March 24th last, the Kashkais, largely owing to their feud with the Kazerounis, have diverted thejltraffic after Kamarij to Shapur, and thence Naudan to Mian Kotal. Kawam-ul-Mulk is most anxious to secure a reversion to the main road, and he hopes that a settlement of the question of the Kazeroun Governorship may contribute towards the accomplish ment of this object. Haji Muntesir-ul-Mulk, who was appointed Governor in place of Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli, more than two months ago, shows no eagerness to set out from Shiraz to assume the difficult Governorship of a town.\vhose inhabitants are on very bad terms with their powerful neighbours, the Kashgais. There is some talk of the appointment of Nasir-ed-Diwan as Gover nor of Kazeroun, of which he is now Kalantar. Khurshid Khan, who has a bitter feud with Muhammad Ali Khan and the Kashkulis since the unprovoked attack on Kamarij last year, has just paid a visit to Nasir-ed-Diwan at Kazeroun. There are rumours of a combination between Kamarij and Kazeroun to eject the Kashgais from the Shapur villages, which formerly belonged to Khurshid and to secure a reversion of the traffic to the main road. This road, however, cannot be opened without the consent of the Kashgais, and the more prudent among their adversaries, recognising this, are trying to negotiate for a friendly settlement. Natural causes may, however, bring about the reversion to the main road, for the INaucan route is ill-supplied with fodder and animal disease is very prevalent on it during the hot weather. Already several large caravans, which came up the mam road, have arrived at Shiraz. There is, however, at present a block of caravans, waiting at different points for a settlement of the road controversy The bad relations existing between the Kashgais and the settled population along the road is productive of much uncertainty and greatly aggravates the difficulties of traffic. It is very possible that the latter, to secure the passao-e of . traffic through their lands, may obtain the acquiescence of the Kashgais for a monetary consideration, which of course will in the end be paid by the &amp; muleteers in increased rahdari. Already the rates of mule hire are prohibitive. I have been able, owing to the effective assistance of Kawam-ul-Mulk and the personally friendly attitude of the Kashgai Khans towards the Consulate, to pass a few European travellers up and down the road, north and south of Shiraz, but the arrangements for such journeys involve for me an amount of labour and anxiety which is extremely trying. All my efforts cannot ensure such travellers against violent insults and blackmail on the part of the road-guards. I may mention that, to enable European travellers to pass in relative safety along the Bushire road, I am compelled to entrust them to the Chiefs implicated ?n the attacks on our troops. For instance, Ardeshir Khan, the young Kashkuli Chief who, after, as I strongly suspect, having shot me, picked me up on the field of battle and tended me with such genial kindness (see my telegram No. 10 of January 8th last) has, in his endeavours to placate me, twice personally escorted up and down the road European travellers, whom I have been compelled to entrust to the care of the Kashkuli Khans. Only a saving sense of humour can enable a British Agent to maintain his equanimity under such conditions. Away from the main road the province is, in great part, no longer even under the nominal control of the Government. Shiraz is mainly a distributing centre for the outlying districts, especially Fesa, Darab, Ear, as well as for Ispahan and Yezd. Pedlars scarcely ever venture out into the districts, which are closed to all regular trade from Shiraz. The north road, as already’indicat ed, is only fitfully open to caravan traffic. General congestion of stocks and commercial stagnation are the results of this closure of the outlets for Shiraz trade. Order has been satisfactorily maintained in the Shiraz valley for the last six months, and the tribal migration has happily passed without any incident in con nection with our troops. This has been due to the able administration of Kawam ul-Mulk and the appeasement, through the accession of Sirdar Ihtesham, of the strife between the Kashgais and the Kawamis. This strife was aggravated and given ^ an appearance of permanence by Sowlet-ed-Dowleh for the purposes of his vindictive hostility against the Kawami family. The results of his eclipse have, I hope, shown that there is no permanent, bitter hostility between that family and the Kashgais or between the latter and the Khamseh tribes. The Kashgai and the Kawami interests of course clash at times, but the fact that Khamseh and Kashgai tribesmen fought side by side against Sowlet-ed-Dowleh and the present friendly, respectful attitude of the Kashgai Chiefs towards Kawam-ul-Mulk prove that these interests can be brought into harmony. This harmony, though it may be disturbed again by ill-advised action on the part of the Persian authorities or by other causes, has given us peace in the Shiraz valley during this spring. In the maintenance of this harmony lies the only hope of salvation through native efforts.4 Having summarily and moderately described the present unsatisfactory situation in Pars, I venture to offer a few remarks regarding the possibilities of the future, firstly, as regards our own position in the province, and, secondly, as regards the prospects of a tolerable restoration of order by the Persian Govern ment. Our own position in Pars has been radically changed by recent development. As long as our soldiers in Shiraz were limited to a number which, in Persian eyes, could pass for a Consular escort, there w-as no native animosity against them. As soon, however, as the number of our soldiers here reached the propor tions of a military force, the apprehensions of the lawless elements in the province were aroused. Sooner or later these apprehensions were bound to take the form of opposition. This opposition, which manifested itself in the attacks on our troops north and south of Kazeroun, has, in the absence of any attempt at vindication on our part, been very embarrassing to the Consulate. Hitherto His Majesty’s Consul, when the local authorities failed him w T as able by friendly communications with the tribal chiefs to protect his countrymen. It has now become exceedingly difficult for him to cultivate friendly relations with tribesmen who are in manifest opposition to His Majesty’s troops. In fact, his advantageous position of friendly neutrality is jeopardised. The Ilkhani and the Kashgai Chiefs have shewm every desire for friendly relations with me. Sirdar Ihtesham, before his departure northwards, sent me a most cordial letter, protesting his friendship and presents which I of course courteously refused. I have reported by telegraph the effective measures he took, in reply to my private representations, to protect our southern telegsaph wires. Muhammad Ali Khan and the Kashguli and Farsimadan chiefs made similar protestations and invited me to pay them a visit in their summer quarters. In view of .their share in the attacks on His Majesty’s troops, I am unable to respond very heartily to their advances. 1 cannot, how’ever, in our present precarious position, afford to ignore altogether Chiefs who control the Bushire road and might, if they wished, make much trouble for us in the Shiraz valley itself. 1 continue, therefore, to acknowledge their advances wdth moderate enthusiasm, laying stress on the fact that my attitude is due to the kindliness with which they treated me personally, when I fell wounded into their hands, and is conditional on the prompt surrender of the culprits of the attacks on our troops. This compromise cannot last indefinitely, and when I can no longer keep up the pretence of believing that they wdll accord us the reparation demanded, I am at a loss to conceive how, without loss of dignity to His Majesty’s Government, I shall be able safely to regulate my relations wdth the Kashgai Chiefs. At present they are all prodigal of promises of satisfaction, alleging that the delay has been due to the critical tribal situation. Muhammad Ali Khan stated that, until the question of Sowlet-ed-Dowdeh was settled, he could not punish a single shepherd in his tribe. They all declared that the guilty parties have fled to Sowdet-ed-Dowdeh or elsewhere out of reach for the present, but they are quite unable to explain, except by grotesque excuses, the escape of the culprits who were under arrest in Muhammad Ali Khan’s camp at Shapur, when 1 was his guest there. Even supposing that the Chiefs have nothing to fear from awkward relations, I doubt whether they w r ould now, except under some very real menace, risk alienating the sympathies of their adherents by the surrender of the culprits. I am of course pressing them in every possible manner, both directly and through Kawarmul-Mulk. Hitherto the Consulate was universally respected by the tribes as the symbol of a great power, and its representations were generally received with deference. It is true that its inability, owing to the prevailing anarchy, to obtain satisfaction for the claims of British subjects, the recurrence of unpunished attacks on British travellers, had somewhat diminished the Consulate’s authority. Yet His Majesty’s Consul still represented an incalculable power, wMch the tribesmen were reluctant to offend, especially as they had no quarrel wdth an official whose role was mainly confined to that of an impartial spectator. All this is being changed. Our troops have come and been attacked twice with impunity. His Majesty’s Consulate cannot hope to retain long the respect W'hich the tribesmen, vaguely apprehensive of the unknown possibilities of England’s displeasure, still entertained for it. The ignorant tribesman naturally argues that England, dissatisfied with his depredations, has sent a military force5 to Pars. He has been able to attack that force with impunity and, as he thinks with success He can only attribute our subsequent inaction to impotence or ear. Nasrullah Khan, British Vice-Consul at Kerman, whose distressful journey to Shiraz I have reported by telegraph, told me that far away on the Kerman border Arabs and Baharloos spoke to him with exultant insolence of the now famous attacks on our troops and, confident in their own martial superiority with contempt of the possibility of successful reprisals on our part. I have already reported on the Kashgai attitude in this respect. Muhammad AH Khan during the pleasant evenings I spent lying wounded in his tent, displayed a similar, though more courteous, exultation, and the most that his vanity would admit was that our troops were perhaps able to meet Persians in the plains. He was convinced of the superiority of his tribesmen in hill warfare. It is evident, therefore, that no solution of the present difficulty other than our rehabilitation by British arms can regain the tribal respect previously enter- tained for us. If our troops are withdrawn after the exaction by the Persian authorities of adequate reparation from the offending tribe, our former position would not be recovered thereby, though we could doubtless continue to exist here with some profit to our commercial and political interests. If our troops were withdrawn without the exaction of adequate reparation, the Consulate’s influence would be completely destroyed. British subjects would be exposed to much contemptuous discourtesy on the part of the natives and would depend for protec tion on the goodwill of the local authorities, who perhaps could be influenced by the Central Government under pressure from His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran. _ It is doubtful whether British firms would find much profit in continuing their business under such conditions. It is still more doubtful whether the services I could then render to^ His Majesty’s Government or British residents would justify the expense of maintaining a Consulate here. ^ If it is finally decided that, in order to restore a measure of our former influence here, armed intervention is inevitable, it might take the form of a punitive expedition to punish the Kashkulis, with the intention of immediate withdra\val as soon as this specific object was accomplished. I do not believe that such an expedition would be difficult, even if the Kashkulis were supported by the majority of the other Kashgai tribes. My experience of nomad tribes in rersia, and specially of the Kashgais, does not lead me to share the view regard- mg the elusive nature ” of such tribes (see Government of India’s telegram of December 29th last). On the contrary, it would seem that nomad tribes in Bersia nre . very vulnerable. They are, from pasture exigencies, compelled to follow definite lines of migration. By occupying certain passes at the proper season we could hold up the Kashgais who, unless they decided on submission, would have either to attack with a view to forcing a passage or to resign them selves to the destruction of their flocks from starvation. The trouble would not be in the accomplishment of such punitive measures but in limiting their scope and effecting a speedy withdrawal afterwards. In the course of such an expedition elements other than those we had set out to punish might be drawn into the hostilities. We would be assisted by friendly natives, whom we would, on withdrawal, have to abandon to possible reprisals. Our punitive action would create on the road a state of security which would be destroyed by premature withdrawal. Merchant classes, British and Persian, would probably clamour for the retention of our troops, would no doubt discover excellent reasons to support their appeals. British local Agents would find themselves exceedingly embarrassed^ to assume the responsibility for recommending a 1 - Wa * an y P ar tip u Hr moment. I need not enlarge on the obvious difficulties which, as experience has shown elsewhere, would militate against the limitation of such military action and the subsequent withdrawal of foreign troops introduced into an independent country, where British subjects have to remain after the departure of our soldiers. Armed intervention might again frankly assume the form of occupation, which would of course be a more arduous and more costly enterprise. It might be possible to render such occupation temporary by the formation of a native gendarmarie under British officers and the aegis of our troops, which would be gradually withdrawn as the local force became efficient. Needless to say, similar difficulties would probably impede the withdrawal of an occupying army as in the case of a punitive force.If, however, armed Intervention is negatived as contrary to our interests, our troops may have to stay here for a considerable time. Their continued sojourn at Shiraz under present conditions has many inconveniences. Incidents, for which we might very probably be unable to obtain satisfaction, are always possible. Experience seems to show that in Persia after grave occurrences, such as the attacks on our troops, there follows generally a period of expectant quiescence. As, however, this apprehensive mood wears off, the boldness of the lawless elements tends to increase. Any change for the worse in the present precarious peace so dexterously maintained by Kawam-ul-Mulk would greatly increase the danger of incidents in connection with our troops. Moreover, so large a force cannot, without danger of ridicule, be kept here inactive indefinitely, while tribal depredations against our telegraph wires and British caravans are^going on just outside of Shiraz. I presume that the withdrawal of our troops is conditional on the establishment of some authority at Shiraz strong enough to obtain adequate reparation for the attacks on our cavalry and to maintain partial order in Pars. The prospects of a restoration of order by the Persian Government are not very hopeful. The gendarmerie alone cannot be effective for such a purpose. Before the gendarmerie can be put out on the road, a settlement of the tribal question is imperative. The experiment, apparently contemplated for next autumn, of spreading 600 gendarmes along the road from Kazeroun to Sivend, is impracticable. The Kashgais, who draw a regular income from rahdhari, are unlikely to surrender the road willingly, and they could make the task of these 600 gendarmes quite impossible. Double their number over the same distance could not succeed with the tribes in their present predominant position. We can only hope, with any assurance, from the gendarmerie that, after many mistakes, many failures in recruitment, after much dearly bought experience, it may, not in six months but in a few years, constitute a regular force, similar, though probably inferior, to the Cossack brigade, which a strong Governor, with moderate financial support, could use in co-operation with irregular troops for successful punitive measures against the tribes. Once the tribes had been thus chastised, it would be possible for the gendarmerie to take over the road. The important question, then, is the establishment of a strong adminis trative authority at Shiraz. I venture to suggest tentatively that it might be worth our while to assist in this work by money lent to the local authority direct. Experience seems to show that money lent to the Central Government is always misapplied in connection with Ears. The man on the spot has a much clearer perception of the necessities of the situation, and though his misappropriation of public funds is unlikely to be less extensive than in the case of the Tehran Government, he would probably use the money actually spent on public service to better purpose than the ignorant Central Administration. For instance, it is unlikely that a sensible Governor, however much he might rob the public purse, would waste money on a ludicrous force, such as that sent, at great expense, by the Persian Government last year, to restore order in Ears. We have seen how cleverly Kawam-ul-Mulk has eked cut, for the successful maintenance of order in the Shiraz valley, the insignificant sums received from Tehran this year. The Treasurer-General might appoint a competent European Financial Agent to control the expenditure of such local loans in a manner similar to that employed by Monsieur Mornard at Tehran. In this manner it might conceivably be possible to build up a local Government, which self- contained and independent of the vicissitudes of an unstable Central Government, could maintain a tolerable measure of order in Fars. At present the only competent local authority at Shiraz is Kawam-ul-Mulk whose successful and prudent management of the critical situation here has done much to remove the prejudices entertained against him. If the Persian Government are able to send us a suitable Governor General, he would, I think, be well-advised to utilise Kawam-ul-Mulk, who, with his unrivalled knowledge of Fars, his power over the Ilkhani and the Kashgai Chiefs, his influence among the Khamseh tribes and in the province generally, is perhaps the only man who today can hope to do anything effective towards the restora tion of order. He is essentially a Government man, and he can never go into open rebellion for his power is bound up with that of the Government. He has,moreover^ owing to the damage inflicted on his large vested interests by the anarchy m Pars, everything to gain by a restoration of order. I confess that I am sceptical of Governors sent from Tehran who endeavour, in the present im potence of the Government, to govern against the Kawami interest. They come and go, but Kawam-ul-Mulk remains, the most stable, the most accessible power amidst the general chaos of the province. I would view with apprehension the removal of this last element of stability in the general dissolution of Pars. A local magnate of such power is of course often embarrassing to the Government, but the Persian Government today are too weak to stand on their own legs in Pars. hey must lean on local support and put up with the inconvenience involved in such dependence. In order to secure Kawam-ul-Mulk’s whole-hearted co-operation with a Governor-General or a more fearless, a more energetic and effective administra tion of the province, if he is to be left in charge of Pars, some means must be found to tranquilise his personal apprehensions, his well-founded distrust of his own Government and people, to counteract his discouragement in the face of the prevailing pessimism regarding the future of Pars under Persian administration. It is this personal nervousness, this uncertainty, this discouragement, which impedes the boldness of his present administrative action and might embarrass him in future co-operation with a Governor-General. Once he felt that his per sonal position was secure from the possible malignity of Persian officialdom and that he was sure of a refuge against the dangers resulting from a final failure to restore order by Persian efforts, he would probably display a much bolder and more effective energy in administering the province or would co-operate unre servedly with a Governor-General’s administration. As far as I can see, the only way to tranquilise his personal fears would be for us to give him some sort of assurance. V\ e might, for instance, without assuming any definite responsibility for him, assure him that, as long as he co-operated loyally with the Persian Govern ment, he could count on our diplomatic support at Tehran and our moral support locally in Pars. I am quite alive to the possible inconveniences of such assurances to Oriental potentates, subject to varying fortunes and always more or less untrustworthy. Had I any hope that the Central Government would be able, in the near future, to assert its authority successfully in Pars by an independent policy, I would strongly deprecate our supporting any local power in the province. Such support, among other drawbacks, deprives us of the advantage which our traditional policy of neutrality has so often given us. But we are today face to face with a grave problem, which cannot be solved by inaction on our part. I would welcome with relief any other practical, less inconvenient, suggestion. Fail- ling any such proposal, I venture to offer the suggestion, for your consideration, and with full conscience of its inconveniences, that it might be worth our while to support Kawam-ul-Mulk with some such assurances as those indicated above. If, without armed intervention, we wish to secure the punishment of the assailants of His Majesty’s troops and a tolerable measure of order in Pars, we must take some risks. Today no Persian except Kawam-ul-Mulk has any chance of obtain ing the reparation we demand, and he is unlikely to take the serious risks which extreme measures w 7 ould involve for his own position, without some assurance of our support. He may of course fail to obtain adequate reparation for us, to restore order in the measure requisite for the withdrawal of our troops. His failure, especially after our partisanship of him, would still further increase the difficulties of our position here. If, however, we do not support Kawam-ul-Mulk, for the furtherance of the two specific aims just mentioned, we must, it would seem, remain inactive spectators of the increasing anarchy in Pars, hoping for the unexpected, with our troops immobilised here under the most unsatisfactory con ditions conceivable for a British military force on foreign soil. By giving such assurances to Kawam-ul Mulk, we could bring great pressure to bear on him, if he begun to show signs of indulging in his notorious obstructive methods. This pressure would be especially useful in the question of the gendar merie. In the present anarchy this force cannot be a success without the co operation of the local authorities, who, unless constrained are sure to be obstruc tive. They naturally object to the expenditure on such a force of funds which otherwise might contribute to line their own pockets. Apart, moreover, from motives of disappointed greed, the creation of a power under European officers,who claim complete independence of the provincial Government and reject its jurisdiction is, even under normal conditions, certain to provoke the opposition of the local authorities. I have already reported on the difficulties continually arising between Major Siefvert and Kawam-ul-Mulk. These difficulties are due partly to the above causes and partly to the Major’s ignorance of Oriental and local conditions, but they are especially serious owing to Kawam-ul-Mulk’s apprehensions, caused by the imprudent enlistment of his bitterest enemies, that the force is intended to be directed against himself. He frankly told my Mirza on one occasion that, if he could be assured of our support, he would not object to the enlistment of his enemies on a large scale. Your are of course aware of Kawam-ubMulk’s consistently friendly attitude towards us. Unlike Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, whose effusive protestations of friendship were never translated into corresponding acts, Kawam-ul-Mulk has been sparing of words but eloquent in deeds. I am inclined to think that those who, from outside of Fars, appear to contemplate with equanimity the removal of Kawam- ul-Mulk, do not perhaps fully realise what would have been our plight here during the last six months, what it might be in the immediate future, without the cordial and powerful co-operation of this shy, silent man, who with a quite un-Persian lack of effusion, has supported us steadily in the face of nationalist, priestly and tribal opposition. I need not lay stress on his assistance in facilitating the movements of our troops generally on their way to Shiraz and the withdrawal from a perilous position at Kazeroun of the detachments attacked by Kashgais. in obviating incidents at Shiraz in connection with our troops, in smoothing away the many petty difficulties which, especially under present conditions, must continually arise in the relations between our soldiers and the townsmen, in expe diting, to the best of his limited power, the current affairs of the Consulate, I do not wish to attribu:e this attitude to disinterested motives or to overlook Kawam-ul-Mulk’s obvious failings. He has little faith in his owm Government, and he certainly believes that a day will come when England will reassert her old position in Fars. Doubtless he hopes that then we will not forget the services he has rendered in our hour of need. I am also quite aware that Kawam-ul- Mulk, much as he desires a restoration of order, wants it to be brought about in conformity with his own interests. If he thought that the policy being followed for the restoration of order was contrary to his own interests, he would un doubtedly be obstructive again I only contend that, unless the Central Govern ment have the arms, the men and the money necessary for an independent policy, they must rely on local instruments, whose interests must obviously be respected. I cannot see where they can find a more serviceable instrument than Kawam-ul- Mulk, who, moreover, has the advantage of being very friendly to us. I have not discussed, as a possible solution, the scheme for subsidizing the tribes, as 1 gather that it has been abandoned. I have previously ventured to express my views regarding this scheme, which seems to me, under present conditions, impracticable and dangerous. Besides destroying the last vestige of the Government’s authority in the province, it would probably involve us in countless petty feuds and might before long render occupation on a large scale inevitable. The tribal chiefs are too irresponsible, too unreliable, too inaccessible, to be easily amenable to our dictation, unsupported by armed force. Moreover^ the present insolent spirit of the tribes would render negotiations for such a scheme almost impossible, uuless we were prepared to make drastic threats, which, in case of necessity, would have to be executed. I understand that on the North-West frontier of India we established systems of subsidization after having previously defeated the natives in war and inspired them with a salutary respect for our power, which, moreover, as they are aware, is ever ready to strike again if necessary. s ’ I have not discussed the question of the prevention of the import of arms and ammunition into bars, as this is a matter of obvious importance and of more concern to His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Bushire. Any effective preventative measures of this kind would of course powerfully contribute to the restoration of order in Fars. At present there is a great scarcity of cartridges a u* uu Z ’^ Ut ^l 15 . scarcit y ^ as ^ therto chiefly embarrassed the Government, which has latterly been compelled to purchase cartridges at the enormous price9 and reject the [ties pities ar5 1 Oriental smeOjineijie- Consulate, I Goveneit, assert Ml the semes ught ahoutio eingfolW he srouldi' itral Goreri- ndeotpolicf, je respected i Kaffl/iil' isidizingie j ventured der presert t vestige of ■olve ns in large scale laccessihlfi Moreover, )f such 2 \c threats, at on tk er haring y respect ke again, 2 ^ rans eac ^* tribes appear to be still well supplied with ammunition, though even among them complaints are heard of the difficulties now experienced m replenishing their stock. In concluding this lengthy despatch with apologies for having encroached so far on your valuable time, I would lay stress on the very speculative nature of any suggestions for, or ponsideration of the possibilities of, a restoration of order in Pars through native efforts. No one, with much experience of this kaleidoscopic country, can venture to sound the future with any assurance, except on very general lines. The general tendency in Pars has been from bad to worse, and any efforts now made to stem the tide of disorder, without foreign intervention, can only be in the nature of forlorn hopes. In the end, the chances are that we shall have to face the alternative of the occupation or the evacuation of Pars. It is even possible that, if the decision has to be postponed too long, we may not have this choice and that occupation may by force of circumstances become inevitable.

From—The Political Resident, Bushire, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Only since my return to headquarters have I seen Smart’s despatch to you, No, 9-Confidential. Since then both the possibility that the Zil-es-Sultan might return, and the imminence of the departure from Tehran for Pars of the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh, have formed the subject of telegraphic discussion. I presume therefore that the suggestion of His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, that Kawam-ul-Mulk should be retained as Governor-General and should receive our support is not for the moment on the tapis. Primd facie, to give active backing to any of the rival factions in Pars is opposed to our policy, and in any case there is considerable diversity of opinion as to their respective merits. I am nevertheless not prepared to say that circumstances might not exist which would justify action by us on the lines suggested by Smart, if we were prepared to do so thoroughly. I would beg, however, that without full ventila tion of the pros and cons, both general and local, no definite decision may be^ come to in that direction, and that when the time comes an opportunity of expressing my views i having regard to the situation and outlook at the moment, may be afforded me. In the meantime, I confess that I am very sceptical as to whether, judging from recent indications, the situation will in any way be improved or simplified by the advent of the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh. I am sending a copy of the foregoing to His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, by post.1 CONFIDENTIA L- ^ s - — 'r 19 : o Enclosure i'*tcr fr-&gt;rn Pore’''* &lt;*cretary, India.

I also enclose copies of further telegrams which have passed during the week, with reference 2. The kernel of Mr. Smart’s exhaustive analysis is, it seems tome, to be found in his references on pages fr* and^lo the “ rahdari ” question. I under stood from one of his recent communications that the Swedish staff had taken this question into account, but it would appear that they can only have done so to the extent of realising their inability to cope with it, and of suggesting the postponement of the discussion thereof. In this connection I can but urge the view which I have before expressed, that the preliminary regulation of this fundamental problem, by negotiation with the headmen interested, is a sine qua, non to the inception of any scheme for policing the road which does not include its military occupation. On the one hand it can hardly be contemplated that we should be lending money to the Persian Government to finance the introduction of a scheme (for the subsequent maintenance of which they will perhaps revert later on to the suggestion for a surtax on Customs receipts at Bushire), which does not exclude from the outset the continuance of the unregulated levy of blackmail from muleteers, recently estimated collectively at ^20,000 per annum, a levy which, in practice, merely becomes an additional charge, in the shape of increased rates of mule hire, on trade goods in transit, mostly British. Until this question of “ rahdari ” is faced and regulated, I fail to see how any gendar merie scheme can be launched with any chance of success. 3. I take this opportunity to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a report drawn up on the subject in last December, by Mr. Chick, the Commercial Adviser to this Residency. Before it reached me the situation had been altered by the attack on Mr. Smart’s party later in the month, and it became inopportune to make any special reportlto Government on this topic in particular ; but Mr. Chick’s communication gives a good idea of the portent of a problem, which must necessarily become an increasingly crucial one in the near future, and is of interest on that account. I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Minister. No. 10 , dated the 15 th July 1912. From—His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, I venture to offer some observations on the state of the roads in Pars and on the gendarmerie now being organised by Swedish officers. Shiraz is mainly important for British trade as a depot to which the exports of the province, such as opium and gum tragacanth, are brought from the districts t 2 SEP 13122 t r i : I ! t llV ! for transport to Bushire, and as a distributing centre for merchandise imported vzd Bushire. The main outlets of this distributing centre are Ispahan, Yezd and the districts of Pars. The last of these outlets is by far the most important and is at present practically closed for regular trade, whether in exports or imports. The present satisfactory state of the Sarhad route under the guardianship of the Ilkhani of the Kashgais makes a certain amount of retail trade possible with the villages along that road, but the volume of this trade is insignificant. The regions capable of absorbing foreign imports to Shiraz are Eastern and South Eastern Pars, especially the latter. At present the hovernment does not possess even nominal authority in most of these regions, which are closed to regular caravan traffic. Occasionally a caravan, by paying heavy blackmail to Khamseh tribesmen, can, at considerable risK, circulate in parts of these regions, but the heavy rates of transport under such conditions, together with the attendant peril, render such trade of a precarious and not very profitable nature. The activity of the gendarmerie is, I understand, destined to be limitted to the main road, and its efforts, successful or otherwise, would not directly affect Eastern and South Eastern Pars. British trade cannot hope for any great revival, unless the districts are opened to local caravans and Shiraz pedlars. However, the success of the gendarmerie would open up two important outlets for Shiraz trade, namely, Ispahan and Yezd, for, if the gendarmerie could succeed in estab'i-hing itself on the Ispahan postal road, little difficulty should be experienced in maintaining tolerable security on the short stretch of the Yezd road running from the Ispahan road just, north of Dehbid to Aberkuh. Moreover, the gendarmerie’s success on the main road would, both by the preliminary coercive measures necessary for its inception and by the moral effect of the opening of the Bushire-Ispahan trade route, greatly strengthen the Government’s authority in the province generally and must incidentally lead to an amelioration of the state of the outlying districts. 1 he main road between Bushire and Ispahan is now in a deplorable state. The Shiraz-Ispahan section is at present closed to caravan traffic, and even to travellers, except under escorts amounting to a military force. In the summer months the Arab tribes, who are entirely out of hand, render any regular traffic on that road impossible. In the winter months Lashanis, Chiharrahis and mis cellaneous brigands from the villages render the Shiraz-Dehbid section very insecure, but caravans under strong escort are able to circulate with occasional robberies. In the spring and autumn the Abadeh-Aminabad section is exposed to Kuhgelu depredations of monotonous regularity and on a large scale. Sarhad villagers and the inhabitants of Shulgistan and other villages adjacent to the road also prey upon this section in the autumn, winter and spring months. The arrival of the Kashgais in their northern quarters generally renders robberies in the summer between Abadcii and Aminabad unlikely without their connivance. With an Ilkhani well-disposed towards the Government, as is at present the case, the Abadeh-Aminabad section is relatively safe during the summer months. The vagaries of the Arabs, however, between Abadeh and Shiraz during these months compel caravans, to and from Ispahan, to use almost exclusively the Sarhad route. Even caravans to and from Yezd travel by the Sarhad route, using a road running from Aberkuh through Surmek and joining the Sarhad route near Asepas. Since the break up of the Government’s authority in Ears the only roads in a relatively satisfactory condition have been those running through Kashgai territory and almost exclusively under the control of that 'tribe. The Jirreh, Firuzabad and Sarhad routes, even under an likhani on bad terms with the Government, were generally safe and subject to moderate, rahdari, which was mainly confined to the control of one tribe. i he Sarhad route this summer has proved no exception to the rule, Rahdari is of course levied but not so ex orbitantly as on the Bushire road, and caravans and the post have been able to pass in safety. ^ The rates of hire, though high, compare favourably with the almost prohibitive prices prevailing on the Bushire road. . . difficulty of the Bushire-Shiraz telegraph road lies in the lack of unity in its control. It is normally only disturbed between Kamarij and Shiraz, this section dominated by the Kashgais, being the crux of the road question. In IS ovember 1910, as a result of our note to the Persian Government of October3 i-a 4 ^ of t,lat J ear ’ Sowlef-cd-Dowleh was induced by the Central Government to abandon h.s policy of deflecting the traffic to the eastern by-roads and to : Tn the , re teIe g ra P h route f'-o'' Shiraz to the border of Kamanj territory. The results were most discouraging. Robberies at once tern place, and Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, being unable to control the road without the wi b them ° f Th e he ,1 dmen ’ 1 Wa f C r pe ‘ led t0 Share the P rofits of ra lidari Tr hlS na . t . urall &gt;'. mvol ™ d a large increase of this illegal imposition on the ohiraz-Kamanj section. From Kamanj to Busbire each local Khan of course imposed similar taxes, with the result that the total exactions on the telegraph route were much m excess of the sums levied on the Jirreh or Firu zabad route. After the eclipse of Sowlet-ed-Dowleh in October of last year the route from Shiraz to the Xang-i-Turkan was entrusted to the Kashkuli Khans and their Chief, Muhammad All Khan, was made Governor of Kazerun These Khans continued the system of sharing rahdari profits with the local’ headmen. 1 he road question was considerably complicated by the bitter local animosities resulting from Nizam-es-Sultaneh’s disastrous regime and by the disintegration of the Kashgais, whose petty chiefs, becoming increasingly inde- pendent of the llkham, tended to exercise an irresponsible, extortionate and multiple control of the road. Khurshid Khan had, until the spring 0 f iqii been in possession o the Tang-i-Turkan, Rahdar and the adjacent Shapur dis- tnct, besides the valley of Kamarij. He had kept his section in admirable order though he had of course levied rahdari like the other headmen along the road’ Incited by Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, Nizam-es Sultaneh made a futile wanVon agres sion against Kamanj. Khurshid was driven out, Kamarij plundered^ and Sha pur appropriated by Muhammad AH Khan, who played a prominent part in these offensive operations. Khurshid succeeded i n reinstating himself in the Kamarij valley but was unable to recover Shapur, which remained in the possession of Muhammad All Khan, together with the control of Rahdar and thenonhern end of the Tang-i-Turkan. A number of Kamarijis who had betrayed and fought against Khurshid took refuge with Muhammad Ali Khan. These exiles, whom Muhammad Ali Khan was compelled to conciliate, have proved a fruitful source of trouble on the road by their extortionate exactions from caravans and their violent insolence towards muleteers and travellers. One of them, Ali Muhammad Kamariji, who is still in charge of the Rahdar caravan- serm, took part in the attack on our troops at that spot. On the other hand Khurshid who had suffered heavy pecuniary loss through Nizam-es-Sultaneh’s aggression has been endeavouring to recuperate by increasing his exactions of rahdari and even by pilfering from caravans. Needless to say, the hostility existing between the guardians of two adjoining sections of the road greatly added to the uncertainty of that part of the route. To make matters worse the increasing bitterness of the Kazerunis against the Kashgais culminated in an open breach and the enforced retirement of Muhammad Ali Khan from the Governorship of that town. The Kashkulis retaliated by deflecting the traffic from the Fang i-Turkan to Shapur and thence vid Naudan to Mian Kotal, thus depriving Kazerun of the profits to be reaped from passing caravans. This road is in the summer very trying for mules owing to the prevalence of fly disease. Khurshid. and the Kazerunis combined against the Kashgais and succeeded in passing a number of caravans by a very precipitous route from Kamarij to Kazerun TJta Bardoun, thus avoiding Rahdar altogether. These caravans, when after Kazerun, they again passed through Kashgai jurisdiction, were made to pay very heavily for having avoided the Naudan route. This hostility between the settled population and the Kashgais has caused periodical blocks on the road and a general state of uncertainty, which, together with the heavy exactions of the road-guards and headmen, has raised the rate of hire to almost prohibitive figures. The Kashgais, since they began to migrate northwards, have been compelled to leave the road almost entirely in the hands of the local headmen, to whom they have leased the road, section by section, from bhiraz to Tang-i- Turkan Naudan. The headmen have to levy from caravans enough rahdari to pay for these leases and to make their own profit at the same time. It is not easy to ascertain the exact amount of the rahdari levied, for the muleteers exaggerate the figures in order to increase their rates of hire. Moreover, the exactions vary, Kazerun muleteers being more heavily mulcted by the Kashgais than muleteers from other parts. On an average, however, it is probable that4 for a single journey the muleteers have to pay about three tomans a mule in rahdari &amp; The road-guards also help themselves freely to sugar and tea from the loads and even pilfer fitfully from other merchandise that takes their fancy. Fodder along the road is of course sold to the muleteers at extravagant prices. I have in previous communications reported the difficulties of passing European travellers along the Bushire road, for, since the unpunished attacks on our troops, the road-guards have lost their respect for Europeans, who are blackmailed and insulted more than Persians. I have not failed to make continual and earnest representations to the local authorities regarding this deplorable state of affairs on the most important route for British trade in Persia, Without money or troops the local authorities are unable to take any heroic measures, and we can at present only hope for some slight palliatives to this disastrous situation. Any permanent improvement on the main road from Shiraz to Abadeh can only be effected by some sort of repressive action against the Arabs. If the Central Government grant permis sion, Kawam-ul-Mulk proposes to go out in person to deal with these turbulent tribes. He hopes to overawe the recalcitrant sections with the help of the relatively loyal chiefs and a force of Kashgais. supplied by the Ilkhani. It is very doubtful whether any efforts he can make will result in the opening of the northern postal route during this summer. Any permanent improvement on the Abadeh-Aminabad section would only result from punitive measures against the Boir Ahmedi, and I see no possibility of such action in the near future, unless the Bakhtiaris could chastise this turbulent tribe. With regard to the Bushire road, ijTappears that the natural causes mentioned above, combined with Kawam-ul-Mulk s incessant pressure and the Bardoun route development, have forced the Kashkulis’ hands. Muhammad Ali Khan has notified Kawam-ul-Mulk that the road-guards have been withdrawn from the Naudan route, and Ah Muhammad Kamanji at Rahdar has informed the muleteers that they can go by whatever route they wish. This would seem to indicate that the Kashkulis have at length acquiesced in a reversion to the main road. However, no permanent improvement in the Kamarij-Shiraz section can, it would seem, be effected except by a compromise between the Kazerunis and the Kashgais or by restoring Kazerun to the Kashgais. For the first purpose it would be necessary that an impartial Governor proceed to Kazerun as soon as possible. Nasir-ed-Divan, the Kalantar of Kazerun, at present in charge of that town, is on the worst possible terms with the Kashkuli Khans. With a neutral Governor at Kazerun the bitterness of the Kashkulis might be moderated, and they might be more amenable. However, the attitude of Muhammad Ali Khan who, since the unpunished attacks on our troops, seems to entertain exaggerated notions of his own power, is not encouraging. Pressure might be brought to bear on him through his fear of his cousin Muhammad Khan, who, is hostile to him. Pressure of a different kind might be exercised against him and the other Kashkuli Khans as well as against their adversaries among the settled population on the telegraph route, by the temporary opening of the Jirreh route with the help of the Farsimadan Kashgais, who have been detained this summer in the neighbourhood of Shiraz as a pro tective measure. Both parties would suffer considerable pecuniary loss by the adoption of the Jirreh route, •which might facilitate negotiations for a compromise. Failing such a compromise, the only solution would seem to be the forcible re establishment of a Kashgai nominee in the Governorship of Kazerun and the sacrifice of the special interests of the settled population in favour of the general interests of the road. This arrangement would not be easy to effect: it might cause serious complications and the temporary closure of the road: it would, moreover, be very inequitable and objectionable for the undesirable increase it would cause in the already excessive power of the Kashgais. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that for several years the Kashgais have had control of Kazerun, and their resentment at their ejection from that town is easily com prehensible. The foregoing description of the conditions prevailing on the Bushire- Ispahan main road will perhaps give some idea of the magnitude of the task con fronting the gendarmerie. Its establishment on the whole of this road wouldinvolve conflict with the Kashgai, Khamseh and Boir Ahmedi tribes, apart from minor operations against miscellaneous brigands from less important tribes and from the settled population. If rahdari is to be abolished, conflict with the local headmen from Shiraz to Bushire would be inevitable. I do not propose to trouble you with academic observations on a scheme of this magnitude. I will confine l my remarks to an examination of the possibility of the Shiraz Kamarij section, ! on which, I gather, the Swedish officers propose to experiment in the autumn | with six hundred gendarmes. It is obvious that the Kashgais, who control the greater part of this section, will not easily forego the income and political power which they derive from the guardianship of the road. Six hundred gendarmes are clearly inadequate to coerce a powerful tribe in its rugged mountains. Under present conditions the only conceivable method of procedure would be for the gen darmerie to come to an agreement with either the Kashgais or the settled population along the road. An alliance with the Kashgais, if feasible, would be, on the whole, more convenient for the gendarmerie, because they are the stronger party. The hostility of the Kashgais would result not only in active opposition from that tribe but would also excite against the gendarmerie many warlike, pre datory elements of Western Pars, especially the Boir Ahmedi, whose regular November incursions on the road between Khan-i*Ziniyan and Dastarjin would, with Kashgai encouragement, tend to become more frequent. Coperation with the Kashgais, however, could only be secured on very disadvantageous terms for the welfare of the road and the authority of the Government. Moreover, owing to the vicissitudes of tribal fortunes and the present disintegration of the Kash gais, such co-operation would be of a precarious nature. Combination with the settled population against the Kashgais would be more equitable, and more in harmony with the principles of sound Persian statecraft, which has always endea voured to counteract and circumscribe the dangerous power of the tribes. Such a combination would, if successful, be of a more stable nature. The Kadkudas of Khan-i Ziniyan and Dastarjin, the Kalantar of Kazerun and Khurshid could doubtless be enlisted in such a combination. But the successful formation of such a combination would require, on the part of the gendarmerie officers, inti- mad knowledge of local conditions and politics, much tact and skill, infinite caution, and the cordial co-operation of the local authorities. The support of either the Kashgais or the settled population could only be secured by acquiescing in the levy of rahdari at a moderate rate. Any attempt to abolish rahdari entirely and immediately would mean that the gendarmerie would be faced by the hostility of both the Kashgais and the settled population along the road. Such general i opposition would render the task of the gendarmerie quite impossible. It might \ be practicable to levy a tax on caravans in Shiraz and from the proceeds pay subsidies to the local headmen as a substitute for rahdari levied on the spot. The danger of this compromise would be that the headmen might take the subsidies and still continue furtively to levy dues on passing caravans. I have, in the course of informal conversations with Major Siefvert, endea voured to explain to him the conditions prevailing on the road and the general political aspects of the province. It is of course impossible to expect European officers without any knowledge of the languages or the peculiar conditions of 1 the East to realise immediately the complicated situation in Ears. Major \ Siefvert appears to be a reasonable, energetic and able officer, and I have no doubt that in time he will gain the experience necessary for the comprehension of the local situation. He hopes shortly to proceed to Bushire to bring up 1,500 Mauser rifles and 500,000 cartridges for theggendarmerie—an enterprise not free from difficulty and danger, for these arms and ammunition will be a tempting bait for the tribesmen. He will avail himself of this journey to study the road-questions on the spot. It is unfortunate that his ignorance of the language compels him to act through native interpreters, so that his information cannot be always quite accurate. However, I hope that he may gradually acquire enough information to enable him to devise some practical scheme for his future operations. Until then detailed examination of the possibilities of gendarmerie action on the Shiraz-Kamarij section would seem unprofitable. A few remarks on the formation of the force and its relations with the local authorities at Shiraz may be of more immediate interest. In my telegram No 87 of May 22nd last, I reported on the informal conference between Kawam-ul-Mulk and Major Siefvert, at which I assisted to6 interpret and facilitate the discussion. The imprudent enlistment of some of Kawam-ul-Mulk’s bitterest enemif-s and other circumstances had excited his apprehensions that the force was intended to be directed against himself. I do not wish to decide the balance of the rights and wrongs of the two parties. No doubt Major Siefvert was rather imprudent in his treatment of Kawam-ul-Mulk’s ^ tribal road-guards (see my telegram No. 62 of April 10th last), in the uncompro- ^ mising attitude he at first adopted towards the local authorities, in arresting townsmen, in emphasising his independence of the provincial Government in enlisting recruits regardless of considerations of local politics. On the other hand, Kawam-ul-Mulk was perhaps unduly suspicious a :d irritatingly obstructive. The trouble was mainly due to the casual procedure of the ignorant Central Government, which sent the Swedish officers here without thinking out before hand some_ practicable scheme for the relations between Major Siefvert and the local authorities and without even giving any information to Kawam-ul-Mulk for his guidance. At the meeting mentioned above, a reconciliation was effected. It was not of long duration. Kawam-ul-Mulk asserted that Major Siefvert was weakening the authority of the provincial Government by arbitrary arrests and punishment of townsmen, by ignoring the jurisdiction of the local administration. He complained, with some justice, that Major Siefvert was surrounded by notorious enemies of the Kawami family, who poisoned his mind against Kawam-ul-Mulk. Major Siefvert declared, not without reason, that Kawam-ul-Mulk was unfriendly to the gendarmerie, that the townsmen, aware of this, lost no opportunity of making difficulties for the newly created force. Finally a rather serious incident occurred. _A quarrel between some gendarmes and “ sarbaz ” resulted in the ) arrest and imprisonment of the latter in the gendarmerie barracks, which are situated in the Maidan-i-Tavileh opposite the Government palace. This palace is at present little used, Kawam-ul-Mulk never going there and Mudabber-es- Sultaneh, the nominal Deputy Governor, only visiting it fitfully for the transaction of business in the interval of his frequent inebriation. It is, however, guarded by Government riflemen. The comrades of the imprisoned sarbaz made an angry demonstration before the gendarmerie barracks, at which they fired some htty shots The gendarmerie also fired a few shots, but neither side appears to have had any murderous intentions. Mudabir-es-Sultaneh, whose private Ul house is close to the barracks, proceeded to the scene of action and shut up the sarbaz in the palace garden. The appearance of the Deputy Governor and of ajor lefvert, to whom the former had sent an urgent summons, prevented any further hostilities. . Kawam-ul-Mulk addressed a private complaint to me on the subject. He stated that, if Major Siefvert began arresting sarbaz in this manner, serious troubJe might ensue. Major Siefvert likewise complained to me. He declared that the Government riflemen had also fired on the barracks from a tower of the palace. He demanded that this tower which commands the barracks and the V° thG M ^ ai a a r? shouId , b ® h ^ nded over . to . the gendarmerie. He intimat ed that he suspected Kawam-ul-Mulk of complicity in the incident. then gettin , g Serious ’ 1 thou S ht k advisable to intervene privately. I pointed out very strongly to Kawam-ul-Mulk the importance which the Persian Government and His Majesty’s Government attached to the gendar- , warne ^ ^ ln \ that, unless he co-operated loyally with the gendarmerie I should be compel ed to report to you most unfavourably regarding his attitude At the same time, I begged Major Siefvert to be as careful as possible to humour the susceptibilities of the local authorities and not to allow himself to fall under the influence of Kawam-ul-Mulk’s enemies. I arranged another meeting between the pair which took place at Kawam-ul-Mulk’s gafden the Salarriyeh Mudabber-es-Sultaneh was also present, and I acted a! interpret Afairlv the poinU^Ms S e C r S10 B n oth a n ln f f ° r i hre , e h T S ’ terminate d in an agreement on ill muturconcTssion, « S ( dlSplayed /- Ver &gt;' reas °n;d&gt;le spirit and made townsmerhimself anH^T r ?^ e ^ ertagreed c nfutUre t0 re Mn from punishing townsmen himself and to hand them over, when arrested bv his gendarmes to res^raM the^wns ^ by 3 SpeC ‘ al - ,ribunal - Kawan/ul-Mulk promised to r^eTt , men , fr0mcr .? t,n g difficulties for the gendarmerie.

A „ M f a i°u r Sie u fvert ho P fs t0 have raIs£ d his 600 gendarmes by the middle of ugust though at present he has only half that number. At the beginning he recruited many townsmen, and there were a number of desertions. Latterly he se ms to have realised that such recruits were not very suitable, and he^as v r llIa g ers ‘ He recently made a trip to Maloo and ther villages around the Salt Lake in search of recruits. He sent a certain Muhammad Jaafar of Angali, a gendarmerie officer, down the Bushire road to nd recruits, more especially from A/gali. This person, however, besides having ''N-/ ought against Kawam ul-Mulk last year, appears to be on bad terms with the overnor of_ the Gulf ports, who, it seems, rendered Muhammad JaafarV mission abortive. Major Siefvert hopes, in the course of his trip to Bushire collect the lowland recruits whom Muhammad Jaafar failed to secure He proposes also to engage gendarmes from the local headmen along the road’ such gendarmes to serve only in their respective districts. The role of such men would be largely that of information agents and scouts. I presume that Major Siefvert would only begin operations with the agree ment or the local authorities whose cordial support is essential. It will not be easy to secure their whole-hearted co-operation. Any Persian local authority is un ikely to view with favour a force which claims complete independence of that authority. Moreover, Persian officials doubtless object to the !expenditure on such a force of money which otherwise might contribute to line their own pockets. ln addition to this, they do not yet take the gendarmerie seriously. As the Swedish officers have no adequate force behind them, they can onlv overcome local obstructions or apathy by a judicious mixture of firmness and compromise by tactful consideration of local susceptibilities and interests by sacrificing the form for the substance, by refraining from emphasising an inde- pendence which they cannot support by force, and by the pressure which Mis Majesty s Consulate can still bring to bear on the local authorities and notables of ^ ars ' Jt is, anyhow, essential that the question of the mutual relations of the gendarmerie and the provincial Government should be defined in a satisfactory manner. Personally I do not think that the complete independence of the gendarmerie is feasible, because no local authority would co-operate on such terms; Perhaps the best compromise would be that Major Siefvert should be quite independent in the internal arrangements of his force, but that in all matters relating to the administration of the province he should be instructed to defer to the Governor’s wishes, except in cases where he considers that such acquiescence would be prejudicial to the interests of the gendarmerie. In such cases a right of appeal to the Central Government should exist, and it would then be for the Minister of the Interior, in consultation with Colonel Hjalmarsen to give a ruling, Presuming, however, that the gendarmerie and the local authorities were working in harmony, the first step in the inception of operations must be to negotiate with the tribes and headmen. For instance, it is probable that when Major Siefvert wishes to take over the Kamarij-Shiraz section of the road, the Pars Government may find it impossible to come to a satisfactory arrangement with the Kashgais. The choice would then lie between postponing the gendar merie operations or breaking with the Kashgais. The question is whether the gendarmerie, after causing the break up of the Government tribal combination, could protect the Government against the results of this disintegration. It j requires considerable optimism to hope that 600 gendarmes of untried military value under Swedish officers unfamiliar with the intricate tribal and political fabric of Pars could replace the elaborate and ingenious system by which, with great difficulty, peace is maintained in the vicinity of Shiraz, a road, however unsatisfactory, kept open to Shiraz and Ispahan, and the Government’s authority precariously maintained in some of the outlying districts.Major Siefvert and his colleagues are nowise lacking in energy and ability, but they have been set a task of the greatest difficulty. I doubt whether Englishmen or Russians possessing the invaluable advantages of an intimate knowledge of the language, of local conditions and politics, of Oriental character, of being personally acquainted with, and respected by, the tribal chiefs, nobles and officials of the country, of being able to rely on the often obsequious co operation of the local authorities, could successfully replace the present tribal domination by a locally raised gendarmerie, without long and gradual prepara tion, without, perhaps, even the support of foreign troops. It would, therefore, be unreasonable to expect rapid success from the efforts of Swedish officers possessing none of these advantages I venture to hope that the commence ment of the gendarmerie operations will not be unduly precipitated. Such precipitation might cause the definite failure of the scheme and, by breaking up the Government tribal combination, create a state of anarchy in the province even worse than at present existing. It would be much wiser to keep the gendarmerie in Shiraz, increasing its efficiency and numbers, than to risk a disastrous fiasco by premature action. Thus retained at Shiraz, the gendar merie might gradually develop into a useful regular force, somewhat similar to the Cossack brigade, which would strengthen the Government’s authority and could, as occasion arose, be used in co-operation with the Government’s irregular troops, for punitive expeditions and in time be put out on the road. In this and preceding despatches I have not taken into account the effect which the appointment of Zil-es-Sultan to the Governorship of Ears might produce on the situation. His name, his wealth, if utilised, might perhaps produce, in a lesser degree, the magical effect caused by his last, brief adminis-* tration of Ears. On the other hand, the disintegration of all authority, the insolent independence of the tribes, may have reached a stage at which even Zil-es-Sultan’s unrivalled influence would prove ineffectual. The present pro- Bakhtiari governing tribal combination in Ears is, in its vital interests, opposed to Zil-es Sultan, and it might conceivably, if incited, openly or secretly, by the Bakhtiaris controling the Central Government, make its opposition effective. Needless to say, if Zil-es-Sultan’s appointment were not secured after it became known that we had been supporting his candidature, the sympathies of this combination might be alienated from us and the difficulties of our position in Ears might be greatly increased. The consequent diminution of our influence over the governing party would react very unfavourably on the gendarmerie, for that influence is its most valuable asset in overcoming local obstruction and apathy.

Present vague uncertainty is likely to be chronic but there are for moment no signs of serious trouble. I think warning might now be withdrawn. Shiraz ; December gth, igj 1. Sir, I have the honour to lay before you my impressions regarding the problem of the Bushire-Shiraz road, gathered during the months of October and Novem ber when I have been continuously passing up and down the route. The disorders on the two stretches of the caravan road between Bushire and Ispahan are essentially different in kind and proceed from two different causes. While as I understand it—the Ispahan section, lying partly in the province of Pars, partly in that of Ispahan, passes through a no-man’s land, is entirely unpro vided with road-guards, and is at all times open to marauding by tribes, such as the Boir Ahmedi and bands of local robbers, local inhabitants and muleteers themselves undoubtedly participating in the plunder, the Bushire section on the country suffers chiefly from being over-run by well armed blackmailers, whose chiefs regard the stretch of road passing through the district of each as their own property and a source of personal revenue to be exploited at will. Risk of almost certain robbery has caused a practical cessation of the passage of caravans between Shiraz and Ispahan: oppression and feuds between the chiefs of districts along the road from Bushire to Kazerun, in which the muleteers are generally made the object of reprisals, have gradually driven muleteers oi£the road, driven trade and prosperity away, and kept the security of that part of the route in a constant state of uncertainty. Whereas five or six years ago some 7,000 mules used to work constantly between Bushire and Shiraz, now-a-days 1,500 mules can be found with difficulty, and work intermittently. The price of transport for every 750 lbs. has risen from :— 1905 . To Now Bushire to Shiraz 80 Krans Shiraz to Ispahan 150 „ 250 (when muleteers ventured to 340 proceed) Krans 230 (about £ 3 - 16 - 8 ) 590 (about £ 11 - 2 - 8 ). On the Bushire-Shiraz section, the migration of tribes Spring and Autumn has of late years caused for a few weeks a wave of destruction along the tele graph line and unrest on the caravan road from near Kazerun to Dashtarjin, but only the stretch of road between Dashtarjin and the neighbourhood of Khane Zinian is subject to periodical descents of marauding tribesmen for the express purpose of attacking caravans. Blackmail and oppression however appear every where in multifarious forms and from complicated causes. By far the most serious of these forms is “ rahdari ”—which was abolished I with other internal exactions by the Persian Government in 1903, and was j intended as a substantial set-off to the rigours of the Commercial Tariff, whereas f it has increased from year to year. Until the question of “ rahdari ” is effectual- | ly dealt with under pressure from the British Government there seems little f chance of order and security being restored, and traffic on the road from Bushire to Shiraz recovering jits former proportions. The Persian Government would be unable, in any case for a number of years, to undertake the task and fulfil its own engagements. For some years past we have kept in the Residency records of the amounts of “rahdari ” exacted from muleteers at various posts of tufangchis, which show no sign of decrease: but from the point of view of revenue thus accruing to local chiefs figures are still more striking.r n'n ii 10 Even at the Bushire town-gate the sum levied till recently by the local Governor and included in the schedule of revenue (despite the Commercial Con vention), at the rate of one kran, three shahis per mule must have brought in at least i ,00 0 Tomans {£ 2,000) a year. After enquiries from reliable local sources I should estimate that the revenue derived by the chiefs themselves from “ rahdari ” by :— Agha Mustapha at Chogadak, is Tomans 5 , 000 . • • • •• {£ 1 , 000 ) Sheikh Hussein of Chakutah at Ahmedi Tomans 10,000 ... {£ 2 , 000 ) Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh at Borasjun &gt;» 15,000 — {£ 3 »°oo) Nur Mohammad Khan at Daliki » 25,000 — {£ 5&gt; 00 °) Nur Muhommad Khan at Konar Takhte &gt;» 15 , 000 ... {£ 3 ,o-o) Kedkhudas at Jafferjin » 7,5°° ••• (£ 1 , 500 ) Khurshid Khan at Kumarij »» 10,000 ... {£ 2,000) the Tang-i-Turkan to Chenar Rahdar the chiefs of the Kashkuli Muhammad Ali Khan and his cousins, have accepted the responsibilities and duties of furnishing guards for the road, and protecting caravans from robbers. For political reasons they were chosen for this purpose by Ala-ud-Dowleh and Kawam-ul-Muik when the Kashgai Ilkhani Sowlet-ed-Dowleh resigned respon sibility in October last. As in the case of former arrangements with Sowlet-ed-Dowleh the Persian merchants of Shiraz on the other part—on their own responsibility and without consulting foreign rights—agreed to guarantee the payment to the Kashkuli Khans of the sum of 1,000 Tomans (£ 200) per mensem for their services and to provide the money, arranged that every mule bringing merchandise to the town should be charged 3 Krans (about 14 d.) } and every donkey two Krans (9 d.) paid into a fund administered by certain amongst their number. In con versation one principal merchant explained to me that at least 1,500 Tomans {£ 300) should be forthcoming monthly at these rates, but the excess would be placed towards any deficit in future months. Certain of the merchants thought that two Krans per mu’e (9 d.) as formerly, would have been sufficient, and if the income is found to be much in excess of the sum guaranteed he thought that they might reduce the rate of that figure. The sum therefore to be paid to the Kashkuli Khans for providing road guards from dang-i-Turkan to Chenar Rahdar will amount to 12 000 Tomans (.£2,400) for the year. The amount, which these merchants may take from muleteers on their own representations may conceivably at the present rate reach the figure of 18,000 Tomans (£3,600), as long as traffic continues fairly regular : but, judging from the estimated revenues derived elsewhere from a lesser tax per mule, I should not be surprised if the takings at Shiraz for the whole year did not exceed £4,000 considerably. Into whose pockets the balance will go is so far undis closed. Caravan traffic and transport between Bushire and Shiraz would, on the basis of the estimates given above, pay over to chiefs—for the nominal privilege of being guarded or of passing through certain districts only by a certain route— the sum of £21,900 per annum (the Persian Government in the Commercial Convention of 1903 having stated that nothing was chargeable. The evil does not stop here, for, if the chiefs provide their tufangchis as guards, in some cases getting a rebate on their maliyat for payment of wages, they expect to retain for themselves the whole sum charged at Borasjun, Daliki, Shiraz, etc., and leave their tufangchis to earn their own livelihood by taking as much along the route as they can from passing muleteers in money, bread, sugar, tea, etc. Thus the so-called road guards are in practically no instance paid by their chiefs, indeed in many cases the tufangchis have to hand over to their chiefs a certain proportion of their exactions. The sums extorted by road-guards on eachmule, 2 shahis here, and 4 shahis there, sometimes 3 or 4 times between the stages, must amount as between Bushire and Shiraz to several thousand pounds each year. The Kashkuli Khans, loath apparently to have to put a large number of their own tribesmen along their stretch of the road, have hit on the expedient of attaching to their interests the Khans of the Dushmanziari by calling on them to furnish men from the Mamasenni tribe as guards between the Maserm Tower and Chenar Rahdar. These wild men naturally feel that they are placed there in order to become rich in as short a time as possible. The Kashkuli Khans are in fact doing nothing themselves towards furnish ing a force of guards, beyond placing a post of their own tribe in the caravan serai at the end of the Tang-i-Turkan, and another at Khane Zinian. From Pul Abgineh to the top of the Kotal-i-Dukhtar the route falls within the district of Mohamed Ismail Khan ; from the Ab-Ambar in the Dasht-i-Barm to the top of the Pir-i-Zan pass within that of his relative, Haji Abdullah Khan of Keluni. The latter stated in my presence to one of the merchants of Shiraz that he and his relative had been told by the Kashkuli Khans to supply guards from the village people, and had done so up to the present, but wished now to dissociate themselves from the protection of the road. He said that there were only 2 posts, or beats of tufangchis in his borders, that the revenue from the 4 shahis per mule taken at each of these, only brought in some 150 Tomans per mensem, whereas the Kashkulis extracted from him for these two posts so to 100 Tomans monthly, and left him to bear the expense of paying his tufangchis—otherwise left them to pilfer. These details will show what a large vested interest the chiefs and their tufangchis have in caravans passing over their road, and my previous despatches regarding the passage of our military caravans laid stress upon the importunity with which the local tufangchis pestered our hired muleteers, strongly guarded as they were, and upon the unwillingness of the Khan to allow even our mules to pass without paying similarly to merchants’ mules. As a matter of principle it has been and will be essential to refuse to allow Khans and tufangcnis to extort “rabdari*’ from mules forming part of our military convoys. Muleteers agree unwillingly, for both chiefs and tufangchis resent our action and the muleteers have been charged double exaction and maltreated on the return journey when they are no longer under our protection. To give a typical instance: on the occasion of the passage of the first wing of the regiment by Konar Takhte a shot was fired, and the culprits disarmed by our sowars. To prevent repetition of such offences their Kedkhudas were told that the rifles would be retained until the arrival of the second wing of the regiment. So persistent were the Kedkhudas for the return of the weapons that they menaced the Persian mule-owners, and compelled them to sign a bond to pay 5® 0 Tomans in the event of the rifles not being restored. After our departure the door of the Telegraph Department Room, in wbich they had been locked, was broken open and the rifles carried off, probably by the owners themselves; yet there is every probability that the village chiefs will pretend that unknown persons took the rifles and compel the wretched muleteers to pay the bond. It is evident that the proposal for bodies of Indian Cavalry to escort British caravans up and down the Bushire-Shiraz road will not alone put a stop to the extortionate exactions of ‘‘rahdari” from the muleteers, under our protection for the time being. As long as “rahdari” flourishes the present dear rates 01 hire will continue and a large part of the road question remains unsolved. Nor would the actual placing of posts of Indian troops at the various stages, nor anything short of punitive measures against the various Khans, by driving them out or disarming their men, appear to me to meet the case. For if foiled in their attempt to levy “ rahdari ”, which is a simple charge per mu l e —the Khans w^ould always be able to charge “ alafi ” instead, i.e., give a monopoly for the sale of fodder and grain to muleteers to certain of their subjects to sell at prices far above the real value, and to include m the price of the12 supplies a charge for each mule, collected by and from the holders of the ' S now L cha rA ed at , s !; verel sta S es concurrently with rah dan . When I insisted on the Khan of Borasjun refunding to me over too Tomans (^20), which he had »taken as “ rahdari ” from our muleteers he immediately retaliated by instituting an “ alafi ” charge, equal to and in addiiion to the rahdari’ charge of i£ Krans, which he had maintained previously so muleteers are being more heavily fleeced than before. Some years ago “ alafi ” at Borasjun amounted to about 6 Krans {2s. 4^.) per mule. To check this system of blackmail and robbery under arms, which is at the root of all trouble on the lower part of the Bushire-Shiraz road, I can see no half-way house between punitive measures against the Khans, which must involve hostilities on a small scale, and some measures to conciliate the Khans. The truth of the matter is that when the abolition of “ rahdari ”, and other analogous charges, was promulgated by the Persian Government, the fact was overlooked that the Persian Government had not the means to fulfil the under- ^u in %? nC * t ^ at t ^ le sovere ig n power lay in the hands of each district chief, ihe Khans were no party to the clauses regarding “rahdari”, and have never consented to^ waive their claim to extract tribute how and when they please.

A budget of correspondence between Nimtaj and Sowlet-ed-Dowleh has been intercepted by Kawam-ul-Mulk, including a letter to the former from Grahame, His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, which the Kawam has passed on to me privately with the remark that Sowlet, though only a rebellious tribesman, is given in this letter titles not less exalted than those given to His Majesty’s Minister, who is also mentioned, that the most is made of a recommendation to His Majesty's Legation in favour of Nimtaj, and that the letter would seem to indicate that His Majesty s Consul-General is partial to the Sowlet. The budget also includes a lengthy letter to Sowlet from Nimtaj in which the latter details a scheme to overthrow Kawam and the Ilkhaui by assassinat ing Kawam, and by taking advantage of the condition of affairs amongst the Kashgais which has been created by the attacks on our troops. She states that her interview with Grahame gave her much encouragement, and that the latter had promised to support the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. She adds that, if the British failed here, she would intrigue with Bussia, whose influence was extending past Ispahan. The Kawam said that, should we wish to give Sowlet-ed-Dowleh our support, he would acquiesce, but would clear out. He reminded me that it was only in consequence of the Legation’s promise to him that he would receive our support as long as he was in charge, that he assumed responsibility for Pars; he enquired whether that promise was maintained by us. I have on a previous occasion pointed out how quick tribal chiefs are to distort, for political objects, communications from Consuls, and in this connection I would invite reference to my telegram 106. My position here, already a difficult one, becomes impossible if the local authorities, with whom I have to deal mainly by personal influence m view or our present-political discredit, labour under the erroneous idea that the rebel Sowlet is favoured by British agents elsewhere, in his opposition to them. I take the liberty of expressing the hope that Your Excellency will authorise me to reply to the Kawam that Sowlet in no way enjoys our support, and that, as long as he is in charge of the Pars Government, he can count on ir backing. The mission of Nimtaj to intrigue against the present regime is notorious we and I consider that intimacy with her or other agents of the Sowlet-ed- lowleh most undesirable until such time as he again obtains the recognition ot Government, if that time ever comes.

Kashgais in north, is threatening Shiraz valley with some 500, mainly non- Kashgai, freebooters, under his brother-in-law, Sowlet himself not ac companying party. Marauders advancing from Khojah captured Diringun from Kashkuli Chief who, with about 50 men, fought for one night and then retreated. Yesterday, marauders made incursion on to Bushire road near Chenar Ttadhar, but caravans threatened managed to get through safely while Gellehzan Kashgais, who by good luck happened to be in neighbourhood, held enemy in check. Kawam has ordered Kadkhuda of Dastarjan to detain up coming caravans, and is stoppiug caravans leaving Shiraz for few days. Enemy is now in possession of Siakh and commands first stage of Bushire road. Kawam has summoned Arab riflemen. Kashgai force is already dribbling in. Army when collected will march to Siakh. Major Siefvert with 200 Gendarmes leaves to-day to hold Chenar Kadhar. He has not yet decided whether he will subsequently go with Government army to Siakh. Kawam’s departure to Arabs has unfortunately but necessarily been postponed. Local authorities have hardly any money or cartridges. Sarbaz are clamouring for pay. They have long been in bast at Persian Telegraph Office and threatened to come to Consulate. Kawam has been restrainin 0 ' them but 31st July, they evaded his surveillance by slipping singly out of town and collected behind Consulate with intention of forcing a bast. I only succeeded in dispersing them by threatening their officers that my guard would fire if Sarbaz came on, and by promising to use my influence privately to obtain them relief. I fear scanty maliyyat still obtainable must be given to Sarbaz to keen them quiet. ^ It is urgent that serious expedition be despatched to drive hack maraud ers and occupy Firuzabad. Some financial help is necessary for this other wise Kawam will probably only be able to re-occupy Siakh and’ drive marauders into Khojah whence they will return when Government armv disperses for want of funds necessary to follow up enemy. Bepetition of these alarms and excursions is most disastrous financially and for general order of province. Arabs, who had been expecting Kawam, will now probably, relieved of fear, redouble their depredations. r J Could Persian Government give local authorities, say 25,000 Tomans to send force to dr*ve back marauders and occupy Firuzabad. Money could be largely recovered from maliyyat of Firuzabad and of Arabs against whom deterred measures would then be possible. 25,000 spent now would be worth double that sum spent after things have got worse. I hope you will be able to persuade Persian Government to succour local authorities with that sum y ithout which they pan do nothing effective. Addressed Tehran; repeated Bushire.

Situation appears to justify in principle views held by Viceroy, but it appears that regiment can only be withdrawn if relieving force is strong enough to inflict serious punishment on any assailants, and is free to follow them up for that purpose. Force proposed by Viceroy appears dangerously small, even for merely protective purpose, and any force sent should be large enough to take the offensive and inflict adequate punishment if attacked (see Persia print of 16th January, section 4). You should request Colonel Douglas to telegraph for my information, and that of Government of India, a report on situation, and to state his opinion as to force required for above-mentioned purpose, bearing in mind that not only have cavalry to be withdrawn, but infantry sent to Shiraz.v\ From Viceroy, 2lst Avgust 1912. loieign. Secret. Your telegram of 12tli August. Shiraz. As, judging from telegrams from Tehran and Shiraz repeated by Cox, situation is gradually becoming more serious, we submit following views without waiting for Political Secretary’s letter of 16th August. We consider cavalry should be withdrawn from Shiraz as soon as possible, a Consulate guard of 12 cavalry and 1 British officer, and 60 rifles Indian infantry being left there. Present guard consist of 12 cavalry and 1 native officer and bl Indian infantry. This increase is necessary for the protection of Consulate, and infantry are considered more effective at Shiraz than cavalry. In order to bring down the Central India Horse and followers, including 300 baggage mules, without serious incident and in becoming manner, military authorities consider it will be necessary to send a mixed brigade of 1 squadron cavalry, 1 battery of mountain artillery, 4 battalions of infantry, 1 company sappers and miners, and details, from Bushire to Kazerun plain, and thence to send forward detachments to help cavalry over passes. The action of this force would be confined to defensive operations for protection of cavalry on the march, and it would not be used for the punishment of tribes. This is their minimum estimate, and should situation deteriorate larger force may be required. It is imperative to get operation through before passes are blocked with snow. It will take at least a month to collect and equip ships for this mixed brigade. If, therefore, His Majesty’s Government approve, we should be glad of early orders. After withdrawal of cavalry we propose that a small portion of relieving force should remain at Bushire and Kishm for protection of Gulf ports and to watch eventualities. On this point we will inform Your Lordship later of our views. We regard these measures as best safeguard against becoming involved in campaign in Southern Persia, with ultimate risk of permanent occupation We do not think that with increased guard there will be danger to Consulate after withdrawal of cavalry who at present are local irritant rather than protection.CONFIDENTIAL Sir W.

CONFIDENTIAL. [ 31917 ] [July 29.] Section 7 . No. 1. W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received Jidy 29.) (No. 150.) Sir, Tehran, Jidy 10, 1912. WITH reference to my telegram No. 403 of the 7th instant upon the subject of the present state of the Shiraz-Bushire road, and the failure of the Persian Government to carry out the conditions contained in Sir G. Barclay’s note of the 4th April last respecting the attack upon Mr. Smart and his escort in the month of December last, I have the honour to transmit herewith translation of a note which I have received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, explaining the steps that the Persian Govern ment have taken with a view to complying with the demands of His Majesty’s Government. It will be seen that Ala-es-Sultaneh staites that a telegram has been sent to the ulema and chiefs in Pars, advising them to adopt a friendly attitude towards British subjects and British commerce. I have ascertained that this telegram, a translation of which accompanied my despatch No. 123 of the 18th ultimo, has now been duly circulated, but I am advised by His Majesty’s consular officer at Shiraz that such messages from the Princes of the Ghurch at Nejef and Kerbela no longer have the same effect as in the past to allay mischief, though they are as efficacious to-day as ever they were to afford a good pretext for making trouble. It is true that arrangements have been made for the departure of the new Governor-General, and I am assured almost daily, from one source or another, that he is leaving in a few days. M. Mornard has been freely accused of being the cause of the delay, through his unwillingness or inability to produce the necessary funds for the purpose. I have repeatedly urged upon M. Mornard the urgent importance of arranging the financial difficulties, and have invariably received the most satisfactory assurances that all is m order. Still, Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s departure is delayed, and only yesterday I was advised by M. Mornard that he had sent a fresh telegram to Shiraz urging the financial agent there to expedite the necessary payments. This fact proves that, in spite of the repeated assurances to the contrary, there has been some opposition on the part of the treasurer-general for which I am unable to account. In the course of recent conversations, Ala-es-Sultaneh has expressed the utmost confidence in the ability of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh to restore order and secure the arrest of the persons responsible for the attack on Mr. Smart. The same faith in the new governor is expressed by Sardar Assad, who professes to anticipate a complete resto ration of order in the south with Sardar Jang in charge of the Bakhtiari country and the governorship of Behbehan and the Kuhgeloui tribes and Amir Mufakham at Kerman. I sincerely hope that such a much-to-be-desired situation may be created by the triumvirate, which, of course, can work in together to some extent, but I must confess that I have some misgivings as to the capability of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh to- himself a sufficiently strong ruler to cope with the situation, whilst I am that the two powerful Bakhtiari chiefs on each side of him may render good prove sanguine service. You will notice, Sir, that in dealing with the clause concerning the punishment of the culprits, Ala-es-Sultaneh’s note states that his predecessor understood from Sir George Barclay that the acceptance by the Persian Government of the obligation to pay 4,744i. as compensation had closed the incident, and that the question o ue numshment of the offenders would not he msisced upon. , , , There is nothing on record to show that Sir G. Barclay ever made sucn a siatemenc, and when Vossuk-ed-Dowleh made the same remark to me some time ago I said that I thought he must have misunderstood my predecessor’s meampg, could only have been to express in his own name and that of His Males .a .&gt; ho e ^ ment his satisfaction that the Persian Government had so readily reco^nsed t ie obligation to pay such a very moderate compensation as that put fomai... * I have spoken to Sir G. Barclay, who c ategoricall y denies th,s statem^n [2545 #-7] 16 AUG 1912.J e ..v/ ; SECRETARY’S Nasserted that the interview in question took place at the Russian Legation whilst Sir G. Barclay and Yossuk-ed-Dowleh were waiting for the Russian Minister. I cannot ascertain that any one else was present on the occasion. Vossuk-ed-Dowleh’s knowledge of French is somewhat elementary, and he may easily, in good faith, have construed more into the necessarily complimentary phrases that my predecessor would have used than the words themselves implied. It is noteworthy that if such an assurance were given it would have had equal force for all the clauses of the note of the 4th April, but that the Minister for Foreign . Affairs only pleads it as an excuse for the non-fulfilment of the condition respecting the arrest of the real culprits, which is the only one that the Persian Government is not in a position to carry out. I have recentlv discussed the situation on the Bushire-Shiraz road and the failure to arrest the culprits at considerable length with A!a-es-Sultaneh, and I have pointed out to his Highness the very serious state of affairs existing in the province of Fars. I have shown him that the situation is rapidly becoming an intolerable one, and I have warned him, speaking confidentially in my own name only, that it would appear to me inevitable that His Majesty’s Government will be obliged to alter their present conciliatory attitude unless it is seen that the Persian Government are able to restore order on the road, the disturbed condition of which causes such incalculable damage to British trade. His Highness has assured me, in reply, that the Persian Government fully appreciate the friendly attitude of His Majesty’s Government, and that they entirely realise the seriousness of the situation. He has pointed out that special local conditions that have no connection with the unfortunate incident dealt with in the note are responsible for the deplorable state of affairs that prevails, and he has expressed his sincere regret that the Persian Government are unable at the present moment, when they are without any reliable military force at their disposal, and have had to repel the rebellious inroads of a pretender in the north, to take the necessary steps to restore order. The Mmister has expressed great hope in the future, and would appear to anticipate good results from the gendarmerie force now being organised under Swedish officers. His Highness has added that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh has been given special and definite instructions to assist to the utmost of his ability the Swedish mission. I much regret to have to add that from the most recent information upon the last-mentioned point that has reached me it would appear that the Swedish mission in Shiraz has so far met with but little success, in spite of the energy and determination of the officers employed there. I shall hope to be able to supply you, Sir, with some special information upon this subject when I have seen General Maletta, who has recently arrived from Shiraz. Ihe question as to which is the best course to adopt in order to obtain that peace anc security upon the Bushire—Shiraz road that is of such paramount importance to British trade with Persia is a most difficult one. With it is closely connected the question of the arrest of the men guilty of the attack upon Mr. Smart, because when once order has been restored the surrender of the culprits should follow of itself. His ajesty s consul-general at Bushire would appear to favour the idea that if the guilty parties have not been arrested by the 1st September, His Majesty’s Government should adopt an attitude which would entail an occupation of the Kazerun Plain. Sir P. Cox considers that such action would place us in a strong position, both to overawe the as i ulis and to assist the Persian Government to force a settlement of the “ rahdari ” or road-toll difficulty which, from the rich returns it gives to the neighbouring will prove harcTto ^olve? qUeStl0nS contleoted with * h e Proper control of the toad that ODBoation frorn'T/L *P St % te n hat SUCh a SCheme W0,lld meet with the most violent well lead to devel ers ' an .

Ala-es-Sultaneh adds that the present Government have only recently assumed the reins of office, and declares that they are paying very serious attention to the question of the disordered condition of Fars. His Highness ^expresses an earnest hope that His Majesty’s Government will give them time iti'\v}iicli to prove themselves, and he repeats the oft-told tale that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh is about to start. . J strongly of opinion that a British occupation of South Bersia should he J avoided as long as may be possible, although I am fully alive to the fact that the present intolerable situation cannot be endured indefinitely. It would, in my opinion be impossible to fix a term for such an occupation, which I fear might be accompanied by very far-reaching consequences. I am also somewhat sceptical as to how much founda tion there is foi the statement it occasionally made that British prestige has been entirely destroyed in the south. Mr. Smart’s correspondence would seem to show that he can still make his influence felt to no inconsiderable extent, although the situation is a difficult one when such men as Mohammed All Khan Kashkuli apparently flout all constituted authority, Persian and European alike. Alternative courses to that proposed by Sir P. Cox would appear to me to offer * themselves. The one is to bear a little longer with Persian weakness, and see whether Mukhbei-es-Sultaneh s mission will be attended with the success that is anticipated by the Persian Government, giving perhaps a warning that British patience will be exhausted if he fails. The other would be to insist upon the appointment of the Zil-es- Sultan as Governor-General. He is probably the only man alive to-day that could be counted upon with some confidence to restore order. It is, however, perhaps late in the day, on the eve of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh s departure, to put forward such a proposal which would meet with strenuous opposition from the Bakhtiari, who would have to be cajoled or coerced into accepting the appointment. It is also possible that the Prince would not be willing to undertake the task at his age. I have asked Sir P. Cox for his personal views respecting the Zil’s appointment, and he has expressed an opinion that under certain conditions he would offer a good chance of improving the situation. A satisfactory arrangement that would not tie his hands too much would have to be made with the Bakhtiari, and he would have to be provided with sufficient men and money to render him independent of the conflicting elements in Ears. ° I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir W. Townley. /(Translation.) Your Excellency, _ July 2, 1912. IN reply to .Sir G. Barclay’s note of the 4th April last I have the honour to state that, as the Imperial Government appreciate the friendly representations made by His Majesty’s Government, and consider it necessary to make their best efforts to consolidate the existing friendship, they have taken into special consideration the suggestions made on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the note under reply. Since the receipt of the note in question the Persian Government have not failed to make every effort, and in most of the steps taken they have been successful. These are enumerated here for your Excellency’s consideration. As your Excellency has already been verbally informed, the attention of the clergy has been drawn to the fact that, according to the statement made in the note under reply, the policy of the British Government is based on non-intervention in the south, and telegrams have been sent to the ulema and chiefs in Ears advising them to adopt a friendly policy towards British subjects and British commerce. 2. Effective measures have been taken for the organisation of a gendarmerie under Swedish officers. A school has been opened at Shiraz, where over 300 men are under arms and being trained. This number will be increased until the plan made for the gendarmerie of the south is put into execution. It is hoped that it will be possible that most of the important roads should be guarded by the gendarmes by next autumn. 3. Arrangements for the departure of the new Governor-General of Ears have been made, and he will start in a few days.4 With regard to the punishment of the culprits imphcated in Mr. Smart’s incident I have the honour to point out that, after the Persian Government had agreed to pay the sum of 4,744h, his Excellency Sir G. Barclay thanked my predecessor and assured ; him that the question of punishment would not be insisted upon, and my predecessor i therefore, considered the question closed. ^ I hope, as I have already told you verbally, that after the arrival of the new Governor-General of Ears local difficulties will be ended, and that the gendarmerie will be more effective. The Persian Government, therefore, hope that His Britannic Majesty’s Government will continue to show the good will and friendship they have always shown in the past, and, as promised, that they will recall the Indian troops in 1 Shiraz, Ispahan, and Bushire. I avail, &amp;c. MOHAMMED ALL1 Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey,—{Received August 12, 11 p.m.) (No. 450.) Tehran, August 12, 1912, 9‘15 p.m. MV telegram No. 441 Colonel of gendarmerie tells me that he will be obliged to alter his plans in consequence of the Shiraz incident. He proposes to keep the 300 men he now has at Shiraz there in training, and hopes to be able to dispatch a force of 700 trained men from here next spring, to take over control of the road. He says that, thanks to the intrigues of the Kawam, he would not have been able in any case to take oyer charge of sub-road this autumn, and that therefore no time has been lost in reality. I am glad to say that the colonel, though much distressed by the incident, appears to be in good heart about the ultimate success of the gendarmerie. (Confidential.) . -n i p i • Colonel would appear to hold acting consul at Shiraz responsible for having encouraged Major Siefvert to take offensive. This the acting consul denies, and there is nothing in his telegraphic correspondence either before or after the inciclent to show that there is any ground for the insinuation. It is quite possible that Kawam may have intentionally instigated an advance which he knew must spell failure, because he has consistently opposed this gendarmerie scheme and never got on with Siefvert. I am sending particulars by post.^'1-- ANARCHY IN PERSIA. THE EX-SHAH’S MOVEMENTS. (from OUR TEHERAN CORRESPONDENT.) The situation here grows steadily worse and contains so many elements of disruption as to make analysis difficult. There is little but the shell of the Persian organism left, and the i%Jief seems to be general that the shell can rdly last much longer. The departure of the Regent and his virtual abdication of his functions have aggravated the process of decay and let loose a fresh series of intrigues and rivalries. So troubled are the waters that it would be strange indeed if the ex-Shah—who appears to have no lack of correspondents—-and all the j exiles whose eyes still turn to Teheran w r ere not seeking once more to fish in them. It is true that Salar ed-Dowleh has been defeated and has lost his following, but he is still in Luristan, though renortod to be moving towards the Turkish frontier. The political situation at Teheran presents no single element of sta bility, so that Mohammed Ali may be excused for thinking that he may yet have a chance of recovering his Throne. It is certain that he is displaying activity. Paris appears to be the present meeting-place of his agents, and his brother Shua-es-Sultaneh, who after his recent journey to St. Petersburg went to Brussels, has recently paid a visit both to Paris and Swit zerland, for the purpose of meeting certain exiles. Mohammed Ali is again in corre spondence with the Turcoman tribes, and is even said to be contemplating a visit to Europe similar to that which preceded his return to Persia last year. It is worthy of note that the Russian Government appears no longer to admit or assume responsibility for the ex- Shah’s movements. This responsibility, before his incursion into Persia last year, was de- i fined by the protocol of 1909; but when the recent arrangemer for his pension and depar ture were made it was found impossible to arrive at any written understanding on this subject, and the Persian Government received only a. verbal assurance that Mohammed Ali was not likely io renew his attempt. Rival Pre-ten u is an their Claims. The ZPI-os ; ' -o S brother of Muzaffer-ed- Din Shah ,?J aupv&gt;ars to nourish a hope that one day he may return to Persia, either as Governor-General of Ears or as Regent. His son. Ormuz Mirza, lately joined the Cossack Brigade as a private soldier ; he has now become a sergeant, and is rapidly working his way to : a commission. This step was taken with the knowledge of his father, and is said to be due to a desire to commend ly ■ family to the Russian Government. Meantime, in Teheran itself both the Sipahdar and the Bakhtiari are accused of aiming at the Regency. The Sipahdar was some months ago appointed Governor of Azarbeijan, but did not proceed to his post. It was believed that in a Cabinet reconstruction his services might be required here as Prime Minister, and it was known that this commended itself to Russia. Tabriz and the province of Azarbeijan have meantime been governed by his deputy, Shuja- | ed-Dowleh, formerly known as Samad Khan, ■ who last year attacked Tabriz in Mohammed Ali’s ipterocf &gt; is still an avowed partisan 1 of the ex-Shah. The controlling force in Tabriz is, hoAvever, the Russian garrison, and the ; rovinco appears to be tranquil. It is an nounced that the Sipahdar will immediately leave Teheran for his post at Tabriz, as the mmour tkat he aimed at the Regency and even harboured v igns for assembling a packed Mejliss to support his candidature has led the Russian and English Legations to think his ! presence more useful in the provinces than in I the capital. It is, however, improbable that I he will actually take over the Governorship, as the Russian authorities in Tabriz are believed | to bo unfavourable to his appointment. Attitude of the Bakhtiart. Several members of the Cabinet strongly favour the revival of the Mejliss, though on a different electoral basis. Sardar Assad also lately made a move in this direction, and called a meeting at Ids house to dis cuss the _ proposal. As a Mejliss seems the only obvious instrument for effecting a change in the Regency, this has, of course, given new life to the belief that the Bakhtiari aim at the Throne. In so far as any internal force can he said to have control of a desperate situation, this control at present lies with the Bakhtiari, one of whom is Prime Minister and another Minister for War. They also hold numerous provincial Governorships, and they possess a comparatively mobile striking force. It cannot be said that they offer much hope of the restoration of order, for, although possessed of the machinery of the Central Government, they take a purely tribal, and not a national, view of the responsi bilities of office. Their supremacy at Teheran is also a constant grief to their ancient rivals, the formidable Kashghai tribe, in the South. Of all possible claimants for the Regency or the Throne perhaps the Zill-es-Sultan, whose famous Governorship at Ispahan and Ears has left a name at which the world still grows pale, offers the best hope for the restoration of order. But it is doubtful whether his candi dature would receive the support of Russia, and it is certain that it would be bitterly opposed by the Bakhtiari, with whom he has a blood feud. In fact, so long as the Bakhtiari maintain their present position the return either of Mohammed Ali or the Zill-es-Sultan is impossible. Moreover, the Zill is no longer young, and though his prestige is un diminished, age may have dimmed his force. A Government without Parliament. In the present Cabinet Samsam-es-Sultaneh is Prime Minister, Sardar Moktashem Minister for War, Prince Ala-es-Sultaneh Minister for Foreign Affairs, Moavin-ed-Dowleh Minister of Finance, Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh Minister of the Interior, Mustashar-ed-Dowleh Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, and Mumtaz-ed-Dowleh Minister of Justice. Since Yeprem’s death the Bakhtiari Minister of War has become also Chief of Police, but it has been decided to get the assistance of two Dutch officers for police reorganization. The Cabinet can hardly last very long, and already there is a dangerous deadlock. Its members seem utterly overcome by their anomalous position, and it seems certain that they can never be got to take responsibility for any act of government which will involve the country in any im portant consequences. According to the Con stitution, the approval of the Mejliss is necessary for any railway or loan project, and though last month there were signs that the Cabinet was prepared to proceed some way in these matters on its own authority, it is now evident that it will do nothing of the kind. The Persian Government now refuses to move without a Mejliss, and the Russian Government very naturally, after its experience of the hostility of two 'previous Parliaments, does not desire the summoning of a third. So grave indeed have the issues become, and So near does dis integration appear, that the loan project seems to be moribund, and the Trans-Persian Railway scheme can for the present not be taken very | seriously here. With the possible collapse 1 of the whole fabric of Government before our eyes, and with no clear conception of what is j to take its place, schemes for sinking many | millions of capital in Persia wear an air of fantasy at Teheran, and there is no doubt that hard realities will presently force themselves on the notice of those who cherish them. The savings of last year are gone and the Treasury is empty. The maiiat, or land tax, has fallen off. The cheques issued by the un fortunate Treasurer-General have frequently been returned unpaid by the banks, and pay ment is sometimes made in bills which have to be negotiated in the bazaar.
