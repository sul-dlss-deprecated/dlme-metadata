A, Dated 28th February ) payment of Rs.8,500 to a Persian sb claimant in order to secure registration of. the Bushire Town Residency buildings under Persian law. ) It has been «ient-ioned that the payment in question has actually been rnade^* and^the registration has now been effected. It will be appreciated that the buildings belong to the Government of India and any proceeds from,Q Ju ^ ' v ' &lt;^ ; r iA 1 i. fa rid Persian law states that floreigners may not own in Persia more property than is required for them to live in. Any property held in excess of this must be registered, and a registration fee calculated as a proportion of the saleable value of the property paid to the Persian Government. ^ In the case of the Bushire^/Residenc^ the original claim for registration was raised by the Persian Government in 1930, but the registration authorities refused to effect the registration when it was discovered that 34 of the 94 shares in the building . were held by a local Persian, the remainder being (J^A^held by the Government of India. Eventually the , Persian was persuaded to part with his shares for a payment of Rs.8,500, and the registration of the buildings was, therefore, completed in the name of the Government of India at a further cost of Rs.4,400/ a fhu a-u. /£ &gt; /yww V /C * *' a v ptfa D * Y The title of the Government of India to the buildings is, therefore, now assured.

The law requiring registration was apparently passed in 1925 but the question of registration did not come up until local registration offices were opened in Bushire. The cost of registrat ion depends on the current value of the buildings registered and has therefore varied considerably since the question first arose. The figure of Rs &lt; ,4#400 is the budget estimate subsequently sanctioned by the Government of India for Bushire. There is no record of the amount actually paid. In Lliss (Mgers' s note of 16th 15arch, 1946 it is stated that the sum of Rs.8,500 was for the registration of the buildings but this is not correct. brc'fc’ •V.oV) * Or BY aIB IMIL. n «' No. P.BO-a/46.
