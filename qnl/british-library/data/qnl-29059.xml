PRESENT, The KING’s Most Excellent Majesty in Council. WHEREAS by “ The Consular Salaries and Fees Act, 1891 ” (54 &amp; 55 Viet. c. 36), His Majesty The King is authorised by Order in Council to fix the fees to be taken in respect of any matter or thing done by a Consular Officer in the execution of his office, and to vary such fees by way of increase or decrease, and to abolish fees, and to create new fees: And whereas by 11 The Foreign Marriage Act, 1892 ” (55 &amp; 56 Viet. c. 23), by “ The Marriage with Foreigners Act, 1906 ” (6 Ed. 7 c. 40), and by “ The Foreign Marriages Order in Council, 1913 ” (S.R. &amp; O. 1913 No. 1270), it is provided that certain things may or shall be done on payment of the proper fee, and those Acts further provide that the proper fee shall be such fee as may for the time being be fixed under “ The Consular Salaries and Fees Act, 1891 ” (54 &amp; 55 Viet. c. 36), and that the fee so fixed as respects a Consul shall be the fee which may be taken by any marriage officer : And whereas it is expedient that the notes set forth in the Table of Consular and Marriage fees in China, annexed to “ The Consular Fees (Amendment) Order in Council, 1923 ” (S.R. &amp; O. 1923 No. 968), should be varied in certain respects: Now, therefore, His Majesty, in pursuance of the said Acts, and with the advice of His w 10^] Privy Council is pleased to order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows: — 1. This Order may be cited as “ The Consular Fees (Amendment) Order in Council, 1936,” and shall be read as one with “ The Consular Fees Order in Council, 1921 ” (S.R. &amp; O. 1921 No. 1131), and “ The Consular Fees (Amend ment) Order in Council, 1923 ” (S.R. &amp; O. 1923 No. 968). 2. Note 5 of the notes set forth on the table annexed to “ The Consular Fees (Amendment) Order in Council, 1923 ” (S.R. &amp; O. 1923 No. 968), and as amended by the Schedule annexed to “ The Consular Fees (Amendment) Order in Council, 1929 ” (S.R. &amp; O. 1929 No. 373) is hereby withdrawn and the note set forth in the Schedule annexed to this Order is substituted therefor. 3. This Order shall come into operation upon 1st July, 1936. And the Right Honourable Anthony Eden, one 6f His Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State, is to give the necessary directions herein. M. P.

The above fees are to be paid in such currency or currencies in use at the place where they are levied and at such rates of ex change as may from time to time be specified by His Majesty’s Ambassador in China with the approval of His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the concurrence of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury.

' v ^'‘* ^ lc tfl M/L c -f‘ 4 H- M ' kf Legal Adviser, The Government of India have forwarded to us a draft King’s Regulation prepared 'by H.M. Consul-General, Kashgar, which is designed to provide for the levying of Court Pees in Kashgar 'by making the Indian Court Fees Act (1870) as now applied in the Punjab, applicable within the limits of the China (Kashgar) Order-in-Council 1920. There seems to be no reason why Court Pees should not thus be made leviable in Kashgar. The Government of India request that the assent of the Secretary of State for India may be obtained to the allowance of the proposed King’s Regulation. Article 62 (4) of the China (Kashgar) Order-in-Council 1920, lays down that 'King’s Regulations shall not take effect until they are allowed by a Secretary of State, or, with his previous or subsequent assent,by the Governor- General of India-in-Council.It would^appear from this that the Government of India are asking for the assent of the Secretary of State for India to the allowance of the King’s Regulation by the Governor-General-in-Council. On the other hand the Consul-General’s draft contemplates that the King’s Regulation should be allowed by the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (as was done e.g. in the case of the 'War Regulations Repeal Regulations,1926') and I think that the Government of India are probably speaking A loosely and mean allowance by the Secretary of State. Assuming that this is their intention, it remains to consider whether the 'allowance' should be made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as well/ 717'? Wt 8900/1 11 10,000 4.880 well as by the Secretary of State for India. Although it is not clear from Article 62 (4) of the China (Kashgar) Order-in-Council 1920 (which speaks of a Secretary of Stat^ that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs need be brought in, I think we should give the Foreign Office an opportunity of adding the name of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as they did in the case of the War : I ■ ■ ■ B Regulations Repeal Regulations,1926. In any case they should be given a chance to consider the proposed King’s Regulation even if it is to be 'allowed' by the Secretary of State for India alone. I would suggest then, that we should write to the Foreign Office saying that the Secretary of State sees no objection to the allov/ance of a proposed King’s Regulatio which it may be thought desirable be made by the -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as well as by the Secretary of State for India, and requesting them to undertake the necessary formalities for the preparation of the document in question. I think that the procedure suggested by you should be followed. You will however have noticed that the Secretary of State is defined in Article 3 of the 1920 Order. As a matter of form should the reference to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the proposed King’s Regulation appear first?

As the provisions of Articles 3(l), 11 and 33 of the China(Kashgar) Order-in-Council 1920 state that the t administration of Justice, subject to the other provisions of the Order, shall have effect as if Kashgar were a district in the Punjab, I have accordingly drafted a King’s Regulation making the Court Fees Act, 1370, as applied in the Punjab, applicable within the limits of the ftlrac China (Kashgar) Order-in-Council 1920. 3.

The Legal Adviser, Please see the Government of India’s letter 'below proposing an amendment to the China (Kashgar) Order-in- Council 1920. Article 54(3) of this Order-in-Council (flagged ’’A”) provides that ’’nothing in this Order shall affect any Order-in-Council for the time 'being in force prescribing a Table of Fees to be taken by Consular Officers ” The effect of this is that Consular Fees charged at Kashgar have at present to be paid in accordance with Note f* (China) to the Table of Consular and Marriage Fees attached to the Consular Fees Order-in-Council 1921 A. (flagged in the attached volume). They have therefore to be paid in British gold or in Mexican dollars at the rate of Is/lO^d to 1 dollar or at the rate of exchange fixed periodically by the Treasury. This arrangement is not suitable since the Kashgar Consulate-General calculate their finances in terms of rupees. In order to put this right the Government of India apparently suggest that there should be an amendment of Article 54(3) of the China (Kashgar) Order-in-Council 1920, but it seems that the more natural course w-il-H be to amend the Consular Fees Order as suggested in the draft. We shall be grateful for your views. 7173 Wt 8900/111 10,000 4.38The Under Secretary of State, foreign Office, S.W. 1. dated 2nd December 1937 / / \f J CLOSURE IN AIR MAIL ■ PER ly- M SECRET.' ,1’ .

This statute specifies the fees in Sterling or in Mexican dollars at the rate of Is.lOid to 1 dollar, or at the rate of exchange fixed periodically by the Treasury vide note 5 on the 'Table of Consular and Marriage Fees' under the 1921 Order in Council whereas the Kashgar Consulate General work in rupees. The China (Kashgar Amendment) Order in Council, 1936, is not applicable as it relates only to those fines and fees which are leviable under the China (Kashgar) Order in Council, 1920. In the circumstances the Government of India suggest that an Order in Council may be issued to the effect that Consular fees in the Kashgar District are to be paid in rupees at the rate of 1/6 to one rupee or in local currency at a rate to be fixed monthly by His Majesty’s Consul General / / -12 \ G-eneral and based on the average rupee/tael rate of the preceding month.

The draft has been referred to the Legal Adviser and its terms appear to be generally suitable. One amendment is necessary. The Foreign Office leave it to us to decide the date from which the amended Order shall have effect. Such amendment; would appear normally to date, from the day they are appropriately exhibited in the country concerned - compare P z. 1099/24 in volume attached - and it is submitted that in view of the several doubtful quantities as regards time involved in the submission of the draft to His Majesty in Council, its communication to India,and publication in Kashgar, no more specific date should be named than the formula suggested. I understand from the Foreign Office that there is to be a Privy Council meeting on April 30th when the draft amendment could conveniently be considered. Once approved, however, the Order cannot be exhibited in the London Gazette until after its formal publication locally The Foreign Office will therefore be glad to oe assured that Colonel Thomson-Glover will communicate as soon as possible the date on which he will publish the Order in Kashgar.

In July 1935 Colonel Thomson-Glover in a letter addressed to Sir A.Cadogan at Peking criticised the present China (Kashgar) Order in Council 1920 on two heads: (1) that its rate of fees and fines had become obsolete, and (2) that there was a defect in the Article providing penalties for persons engaged in smuggling which ^he «S£l£ed)in Kashgana.as a rule concerns opium. 2. The first defect arises out of the depreciation of the paper tael, and Colonel Thomson-Glover’s original suggestion was that fees and fines specified in the Order should in future be paid in Kashgar silver taels and thus on the scale originally intended at the time when the Order was framed. There is, however, a strong likelihood that the silver tael may disappear from circulation, and accordingly Sir A.Cadogan suggested in his Peking despatch jnjo.1426 of the 10th September 1935 that fines which are not paid in silver taels should under the amended order be paid in rupees at the rate of Rs.2 per tael. The Government of India express agreement with this suggestion and it is proposed that the Foreign Office should be informed that X *k' Sir A.Cadogan may be instructed that this amendment will i be issued. It is proposed further that the Foreign Office should draw up the draft amendment as they did, for example, in the case of the Bahrein (^Ainend£ftg V)rder in Council 1924, and that when this draft amendment has been approved by this Office it shall then be submitted to the 3939 5000 7/35 Privy Council. 3. The other defect concerns the failure of the China (Kashgar) Order in Council to provide an adequate penalty for those who deal in or are in possession of smuggled goods or property known to be smuggled.

Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to refer to previous correspondence, ending with India Office letter (P.^. 9257/ / 35) of 16th January, regarding proposed amendments in the China (Kasngar) Order in Council, 1920. 2. It will be recalled that his Majesty’s Consul-General at Kashgar has recommended that Section 27 of the Order should be amended in order to provide a suitable penalty for oersons dealing in or being in possession of smuggled goods or property, knowing them to be smuggled. his special concern was with opium. In subsequent correspondence it was suggested that this might be conveniently effected by the introduction of a King’s Regulation under Article 61 of the Order in Council. I am to suggest, however, that such action is unnecessary, as it appears on investigation that the Narcotics Prohibition Regulations, 1924, to which reference was made in Sir A. Cadogan’s despatch No. 1426 of 10th September last, were in fact published at Kashgar as China (Kashgar) King’s Regulation ino. 1 of 1924, dated 26th May, 1924, under Article 61 of the China (Kashgar) Order in Council, 1920. I am to refer in this connexion to the correspondence ending with the letter from the India Office P 3416/26 of 6th October, 1926. 3 . In these circumstances Mr. Eden proposes, subject to the concurrence of the Marquess of Zetland, to inform His Majesty s /Ambassador Che Under Secretary of State, India Office. qoPv s eidf ,f /u--v- it — .■•*=*Ambassador at Peking that for the reason mentioned no action is required in regard to paragraph 4 of his despatch IMo. 1426 of 10th September, 19S5. 4. With reference to paragraph 3 of that despatch Mr. Eden notes that in their letter No. F 544-X/35 of 14th December, 1935, the Government of India express agreement with the suggestion made by Sir A. Gadogan that fees and fines at Kashgar, if not paid in Kashgar silver taels or the equivalent thereof in local currency, should be levied at the rate of two runees, or the equivalent thereof in local currency, for each Kashgar tael. Subject to the concurrence of the Marquess of Zetland it is therefore proposed to iniorm Sir A. Cadogan that an amendment to the China (Kashgar) Order in Council, 1920, will be issued, putting this proposal into effect. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant.NOTICE.

With reference to Lieutenant-Colonel Thomson Glover’s suggestion for a revision of the rate of fees and fines laid down in the Order, Sir Samuel Hoare is inclined to agree with the views outlined in paragraph 3 of Sir A. Cadogan’s despatch. He would be glad however to receive Lord Zetland’s observations on this question. 3. With regard to Lieutenant-Colonel Thomson Glover’s recommendation for an amendment in the Order so as to provide for the imposition of a penalty for persons dealing in smuggled opium, Sir Samuel Hoare is advised that the necessary provisions might conveniently be introduced by a King’s Regulation under Article 61 of the Kashgar Order-in-Council.

Since the Order in Council in question was drafted without consultation Either with this Babassy or with His Majesty’s Supreme Court at Shanghai, I hesitate to intervene in the matter, as I feel that any necessary amendments would more fittingly be made by the India Office and Government of India. It taay not however be out of place to submit the following observations: 3 . I a ree with Colonel Thomson Glover that a revision of the rate of fees and fines laid down in the Order seems called for, in view of the vagueness of the te?m w Kashgar Teel*‘ and the depreciation of the local paper currency. If, however, the Kashgar Silver Tael is likely to disappear completely from circul» tion in the near future, as seemed probable a few years ago, there would be difficulty in fixing its equivalent in local currency, and the araend*&gt;ent suggested by Colonel Thomson Glover would not provide a lasting solution of /the The Right Honourable, Sir Samuel Hoare, Cf.C.R.I., G.B.K., C. .0.»(SGD) ALEXANDER CADOCAN th© difficulty. It might t arefore ba ppeferabla to stipulate that fees* and fines» if not paid in Kashgar Silver Taels or the equivalent thereof in local currency, will be levied at the rate of Two mipees, or the equivalent thereof in local currency, for each Kashgar Tael. 4. Colonel Thomson Glover’s second recommendation relates to the failure of Article 87 of the K&amp;ehgar Order in Council to provide a penalty for persons dealing in sasuggled opium. Article 74 of the China Order in Council, 1985, is similar; but in China such an offence might be dealt with under the Narcotics Prohibition Regulations, 1984, and such regulations would probably serve this purpose at Kashgar.

ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter No 58&gt; «L Dated 21 APR. 1932 . Receivrc: 9 &lt;V'AY. ^32■■■ tmmm In the High Court of Judicature at Lahore Civil Appeal Ho.1505 of 1930. Kanhaya Lai Sardha Ham Appellants ve re us Baldeo Dae &amp;c Respondents. Appellant : By Mr. Badri Das, Advocate. Respondent: By Mr. Hem Raj Maharan for Mr. Me hr Chand Mahajan, Advocate, and Mr. C.H.Carden Hoad, Government Advocate on behalf of the Crown. J u dgmen t. This is an appeal from a decree of the Consul-General at Kashgarh passed under the jurisdiction vested in him by His Majesty the King’s Order-in-Counc il, dated the 11th March 1920, published in the Gazette of India under notification Lo.2058-G, dated the 4th October 1920. The appeal was pre sented to the Consul-General at Kashgarh and was forwarded by him to this Court under the provisions of paras 38 to 41 of the Order-in-Council. in forwarding the appeal His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General remarked that it was presumed that the necessary Court-fee stamps would be affixed by the appellant or his representative before the appeal was heard. The Bench before whom the appeal first came noted that Court-fees were apparently necessary as the ordinary rules applicable to the High Court seemed to apply and as all that the Order-in-Council did was to give a right of appeal to the High Court. The Bench, however, did not think it desirable finally to decide tte point in question till parties had an opportunity of attending. Parties are now represented by counsel before us and we have heard arguments on the question the Government Advocate also appearing on behalf of the financial Commissioners. Para 8 of the Kashgarh Order-in-Council, 1920, runs as follows:-”(1) Subject to the other provisions of this Order, and. to any Treaties for the time being in force relating to Kashgarh, His Majesty’s criminal and civil jurisdiction within the limits of this Order shall, so far as circumstances admit, be exercised on the principles of, and in conformity with, the enactments for the time being applicable as hereinafter mentioned of the Governor-General of India in Council, and of tte Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab in Council, and in accordance with the powers vested in, and the course of procedure and practice observed by and before, the Courts in the Punjab according to their respective jurisdiction and authority, and, so far as such enactments, powers, procedure, and practice are applicable, shall be exercised in accordance with justice, equity, and good conscience. ” (2) The enactments mentioned in the First Schedule to this order are hereby made applicaole within the limits of this Order as from the commencement of this Orde r”. # * * In the first schedule the Court-fees Act is not mentioned. It is, therefore, not applicable in Kashgarh. Under para 33 the Consul-G-eneral shall be deemed to oe District Judge, and the Court shall be deemed to be the District oourt of Principal ourt of Original Jurisdiction in the district; the .vhie^ (High) Court of the Punjab shall be deemed to be the highest Civil Court of Appeal for the district and the Court authorised to hear appeals from the decisions of the District Court. Paras 38 to 41 allow a person desirous of appealing to present his memorandum of appeal to the Court, i.e. to the Consul-General, and after serving notice and taking written arguments which the parties may desire to submit, the Consul- General is empowered to forward the appeal to this high Court. Lastly in paras 54 and 55 provision is made for framing rules, imposing fees leviable in respect of any proceedings in, or processes issued out of, the Court, Ho such rules, however, have be e n f rame d. Mr. Badri Das on behalf of the appellants contended that no Court-fees need be paid on the memorandum of appeal in this Court as the Court-fees Act is not in force in Kashgarh and the appeal was instituted in Kashgarh by presentation of the memorandum of appeal to Kis Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General underunder para 38 of the Order-in-Council. He also contended that the jurisdiction conferred upon this Court was not under an Indian Statute but under His Majesty’s Order-in-Council, and that, therefore, the Court-fees Act, which was ordinarily applicable to the High Court, did not apply to this extra ordinary jurisdiction. As against this it was contended by the learned Government Advocate that this Court is bound by the provisions of section 4 of the Court-fees Act, especially as there is nothing in tne Kashgar h Orde r-in-Co unc il, 1920, to modify those provisions, so far as they were applicable to this Court. The Government Advocate was able to point out to us a nearly parallel Order-in-Counc il, namely, The Persian Coast and islands Order-in-Council, 1907. The provisions of that Order-in-Counc il are with minor differences the same as those of the Kashgarh Order-in-Counc il, 1920. The a Appellate Court under the 1907 Order-in-Council was, of course, the High Court of Bombay. The Government Advocate informed us that appeals under that Order-in-Council, which has now been cancelled, used to be stamped with full Court-fees in the Bombay Court as a matter of psui practice, though the question of tne legality of the charge never fell to be judicially decided. There is thus no authority on tne question. It seems to me that there can be no escape from the conclusion tteit section 4 of the Court-fees Act applies to all appeals to this Court from Courts subject to its superintendence. By virtue of para 33 of the Order-in-Council this Court is the hig he st Civil Court of Appeal for the Court of the Consul- General, Kashgarh. Under section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1915, each of the High Courts lias superintendence over all Courts for the time being subject to its appellate jurisdiction. It is true that provision is made for instituting the appeal in the Court of the Consul-General and for him to transmit the appeal to the High Court; that however, does not necessarily mean that section 4 of the CourtCourt-fees Act has been repealed. Further, the fact that the Ax Court-fees Act is not in force in Kashgarh does not imply that appeals in this Court from decisions of the Court in Kashgarh also are exempt from Court-fees. In my judgment, Court-fees are payable and I would direct that they be paid within two months. If they are paid, the appeal will be posted for hearing and if not, the appeal should be posted for further orders. Sd/- J.Addison, Judge. I concur. Sd.

(3) If in any case under this Order it appears to the Court that the attendance of the Minister, or of any person attached to or being a member of the Legation, or being in the service of the Legation, to give evidence before the Court is requisite in the interests of justice, the Court may address to the Minister a request in writing for such attendance. (4) A person attending to give evidence before the Court shall not be compelled or allowed to give any evidence or produce any document, if, in the opinion of the Minister, signified by him personally or in writing to the Court, the giving or production thereof would be injurious to His Majesty’s service. 35. Where, by virtue of any Imperial Act, or of this Order, or otherwise, any provisions of any Imperial Acts, or of any Law of a British possession, or of any Orders in Council other than this Order, are applicable in China, or any forms, regulations, or procedure prescribed or established by or under any such Act, Law or Order are made applicable for any purpose of this Order or any other Order relating to China, such Acts, Laws, Orders, forms, regulations, or procedure may be construed or used with such alterations and adaptations not affecting the substance as may be necessary having regard to local circum stances, and anything required to be done by, to, or before any Court, Judge, officer, or authority may be done by, to, or before a Court, Judge, officer, or authority having the like or analogous functions, or by, to, or before any officer designated by the Secretary of State or by the Court (as the case may require) for that purpose; and theK % 12 SU ' - , Si 9 £$d 8 &amp; 'HX&amp;nlai jLXJtar % llfiHV-QO us ’t&amp;bi re c.r:&gt; 1 ♦ '•'*.tj* Jbfef. i. 1 * seal of the Supreme or Provincial Court (as the case may be) may be substituted for any other seal; and in case any difficulty occurs in the application it shall be lawful for a Secretary of State to direct by, to, or before whom and in what manner anything is to be done, and such Act, Law, Order, form, regulation, or pro cedure shall be construed accordingly.

( 2 ) In the Supreme Court there may be one, two, or three Assessors, as the Court thinks fit. (3) In a Provincial Court there shall ordinarily be not fewer than two and not more than four Assessors. Where, however, by reason of local circumstances, the Court is able to obtain the presence of one Assessor only, the Court may, if it thinks fit, sit with one Assessor only: and where, for like reasons, the Court is not able to obtain the presence of an Assessor, the Court may, if it thinks fit, sit without an Assessor—the Court, in every case, recording in the Minutes its reasons for sitting with one Assessor only or without an Assessor. (4) An Assessor shall not have any voice in the decision of the Court in any case, civil or criminal; but an Assessor dissenting, in a civil case, from any decision of the Court, or, in a criminal case, from any decision of the Court; or the conviction or the amount of punishment awarded, may record in the Minutes his dissent, and the grounds thereof, and shall be entitled to receive without payment a certified copy of the Minutes. 38. —( 1 ) Any person failing to attend as juror or Assessor according to a summons shall be deemed guilty of a con tempt of Court, and shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £ 10 , but a person shall not be liable to fine for non-attendance unless he is resident in the Consular district in which the Court sits.

Part III. —Criminal Matters. 39-—d) Except as regards offences made or declared such by this or any other Order relating to China, or by any Rules or Regulations made under any Order :— Any act that would not by a Court of Justice having criminal jurisdiction in England be deemed an offence in England shall not, in the exercise of criminal jurisdiction under this Order, be deemed an offence, or be the subject of any criminal proceeding under this Order. ( 2 ) Subject to the provisions of this Order, criminal jurisdic tion under this Order shall, as far as circumstances admit, be exercised in the principles of and in conformity with English lawK &amp;sU % &lt; . aHt oj i ^ I % Xi v- f 1 fef itl '% •&gt; &gt; a&amp;' ■J. i&gt;«t -■ £ 14 for the time being, and with the powers vested in the Courts of Justice and Justices of the Peace in England, according to their respective jurisdiction and authority.

Y, c. 6 ), by the Court in the exercise of its criminal juris diction on the principles of and in conformity with English law for the time being, the words “ judicial proceeding ” in the said Act shall be deemed to include a proceeding before a Chinese Court, or a Court in China of any State in amity with His Majesty. (4) If any person subject to the jurisdiction of the Court does any act in relation to proceedings in a Chinese Court, or before a Chinese judicial officer, or in a Court or before a judicial officer in China of any State in amity with His Majesty, which, if done in the course of, or in relation to, any proceedings in the Court, would have been punishable as an offence, such person shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable, on conviction, to such punishment as he would have been liable to if the offence had been committed in the course of, or in relation to, proceedings in the Court. Local Jurisdiction in Criminal Matters. 40. Every court may cause to be summoned or arrested, and brought before it, any person subject to and being within the limits of its jurisdiction, and accused of having committed an offence cognizable under this Order, and may deal with the accused according to the jurisdiction of the Court and in con formity -with the provisions of this Order. 41. For the purposes of criminal jurisdiction every offence and cause of complaint committed or arising within the limits of this Order shall be deemed to hav£ been committed or to have arisen, either in the place where the same actually was committed or arose, or in any place where the person charged or complained of happens to be at the time of the institution or commencement of the charge or complaint. » 42. Where a person accused of an offence escapes or removes from the Consular district within which the offence was com mitted, and is found within another Consular district, the Court within whose district he is found may proceed in the case to trial and punishment, or to preliminary examination (as the case may require) in like manner as if the offence ha^ been committed in its own district; or may, on the requisition or with the consent of the Court within whose district the offence was committed, send him in custody to that Court, or require him to give security for his surrender to that Court, there to be dealt with according to law. Where any person is to be so sent in custody, a warrant shall be issued by the Court within whose district he is found, and that warrant shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and detain the person therein named, andr 15 to cair} him to and deliver him up to the Court within whoso district the offence was committed, according to the warrant. 43.—( 1 ) In cases of murder or manslaughter, if either the death, or the criminal act which wholly or partly caused the death, happened within the jurisdiction of a Court acting under this Order, that Court shall have the like jurisdiction over any British subject who is accused either as the principal offender, or as accessory before the fact to murder, or as accessory after the fact to murder or manslaughter, as if both the criminal act and the death had happened within that jurisdiction. (2) In the case of any offence committed on the high seas, or within the Admiralty jurisdiction, by any British subject on board a British ship, or on board a foreign ship to which he did not belong, the Court shall, subject to the provisions of this Order, have jurisdiction as if the offence had been committed within the jurisdiction of that Court. In cases tried under this Article no different sentence can be passed from the sentence which could be passed in England if the offence were tried there. (3) The foregoing provisions of this Article shall be deemed to be adaptations, for the purposes of this Order and of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, of the following enactments, that is to say :— The Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act, 1849 (12 &amp; 13 Viet. c. 96). The Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act, 1860 (23 &amp; 24 Viet. c. 88 ). The Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 (57 &amp; 58 Viet. c. 60), Part XIII. And those enactments shall apply accordingly and be adminis tered in China. Apprehension and Custody of Accused Persons. 44 . — ( 1 ) Where a person accused of an offence is arrested on a warrant issuing out of any Court, he shall be brought before the Court within forty-eight hours after the arrest, unless in any case circumstances unavoidably prevent his being brought before the Court within that time, which circumstances shall be recorded in the Minutes. (2) In every case, he shall be brought before the Court as soon as circumstances reasonably admit, and the time and circum stances shall be recorded in the Minutes. 45. —(1) Where an accused person is in custody, he shall not be remanded at any time for more than seven days, unless circum stances appear to the Court to make it necessary or proper that he should be remanded for a longer time, which circumstances, and the time of remand, shall be recorded in the Minutes. (2) In no case shall a remand be for more than fourteen days at one time, unless in case of illness of the accused or other case of necessity.mm ■Bh . . t. *j.. ^ li «L H. \ i&amp; 'i i 16 46. W here the Supreme Court or a Provincial Court issues a summons or warrant against any person on complaint of an offence committed on board of, or in relation to, a British ship, then, if it appears to the Court that the interests of public justice so require, the Court may issue a warrant or order for the detention of the ship, and may cause the ship to be detained accordingly, until the charge is heard and determined, and the order of the Court thereon is fully executed, or for such shorter time as the Court thinks fit; and the Court shall have power to make all such orders as appear to it necessary or proper for carrying this pro vision into effect. 47. Every Provincial Court shall execute any writ, order, or warrant issuing from the Supreme Court, and may take security from any person named therein for his appearance personally or by attorney, according to the writ, order, or warrant; or may cause such person to be taken in custody or otherwise to the Supreme Court or elsewhere in China, according to the writ, order, or warrant. 48. —( 1 ) The Court may, in its discretion, admit to bail a person accused of any of the following offences, namely :— Any felony. Riot. Assault on any officer in the execution of his duty, or on any person acting in his aid. Neglect or breach of duty by an officer. But a person accused of treason or murder shall not be admitted to bail except by the Supreme Court. (2) In all other cases the Court shall admit the accused to bail unless the Court, having regard to the circumstances, sees good reason to the contrary, which reason shall be recorded in the Minutes. (3) The Supreme Court may admit a person to bail, although a Provincial Court has not thought fit to do so. (4) The accused who is to be admitted to bail, either on remand or on or after trial ordered, shall produce such surety or sureties as, in the opinion of the Court, will be sufficient to ensure his appearance as and when required, and shall with him or them enter into a recognizance accordingly. Trial with Jury or Assessors. 49. —(1) Where a person is accused of treason, murder or piracy the case must be tried on a charge before the Supreme Court with a jury. (2) In each of the two following cases, namely :— (i) Where a person is accused of manslaughter, rape, arson, burglary, housebreaking, robbery with violence, forgery, sodomy or perjury; or (ii) Where a person is accused of an offence other than as aforesaid, but it appears to the Court at any time during hearing, the opinion of the Court being rrecorded in the Minutes, that such offence charged, if proved, would not be adequately punished by imprison ment for three months with hard labour, or by a fine of £ 20 , or both such imprisonment and fine— the offence shall be tried on a charge with a jury or assessors (according to the provisions of this Order applicable to the Court). £ In the Supreme Court the charge shall be tried with a jury, unless the Court is of opinion that a jury cannot be obtained. (3) The Supreme Court may, for any special reason, direct that any case shall be tried with assessors or a jury, and a Pro vincial Court may, for any special reason, direct that any case shall be tried with assessors. In each such case the special reason shall be recorded in the Minutes. 50. —( 1 ) Where an accused person is ordered to be tried before a Court with a jury or with assessors, he shall be tried as soon after the making of the order as circumstances reasonably admit. (2) As long notice of the time of trial as circumstances reason ably admit shall be given to him in writing, under the seal of the Court, which notice, and the time thereof, shall be recorded in the Minutes. 51. —( 1 ) The Supreme Court shall, when required by the Secretary of State, send to him a report of the sentence of the Court in any case tried before that Court with a jury or assessors, with a copy of the Minutes and notes of evidence, and with any observations which the Court thinks fit to make. (2) Every Provincial Court shall, in accordance with Rules of Court, send to the Supreme Court a report of the sentence of the Court in every case tried by the Court with assessors, with such Minutes, notes of evidence, and other documents as such Rules may direct, and with any observations which the Court thinks fit to make. Summary Trial. 52. When the complaint discloses an offence which is not required or directed to be heard on a charge, the accused may be tried summarily on the complaint. Where an offence is tried summarily no greater punishment shall be awarded than im prisonment for three months or a fine of £20, or both. Provided that in cases tried summarily before the Registrar he may award in respect of an offence any punishment which may in respect of a similar offence be awarded in England. Preliminary Examination. 53.—(1) Where the accused is before the Court, and it appears to the Court that the complaint discloses an offence— (a) Which ought to be tried in or reported to another Court; or (b) Which ought to be tried before the same Court with a jury or assessors;the Court shall proceed to make a preliminary examination in the prescribed manner. ( 2 ) On the conclusion of the preliminary examination, the Court shall bind by recognizance the prosecutor and every witness to appear at the trial to prosecute, or to prosecute and give evidence, or to give evidence (as the case may be), and if the case is to be tried in or reported to another Court, shall forthwith send, the depositions, with a minute of other evidence (if any) and a report, to the Court before which the trial is to take place. 54. \V here a British subject is accused of an offence the cognizance whereof appertains to any Court established under this Order, and in the opinion of the Supreme Court it is expedient that the offence be inquired of, tried, determined, and punished in a British possession, the accused may (under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, section 6 ) be sent for trial to Hong Kong or to Burma; and the Supreme Court of Hong Kong and the Sessions Court at Mandalay shall respectively be the authorised Courts for the purposes of that enactment. The Supreme Court may, where it appears so expedient, by warrant under the hand of a Judge and the seal of the Court, cause the accused to be sent for trial to Hong Kong or* to Mandalay accordingly. The warrant shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and detain the person therein named, and to carry him to and deliver him up at Hong Kong or Mandalay, according to the warrant. Where any person is to be so sent to Hong Kong or to Burma, the Court before which he is accused shall take the preliminary examination, and if it seems necessary and proper shall bind over such of the proper witnesses as are British subjects in their own recognizances to appear and give evidence on the trial. 55. — ( 1 ) If a British subject, having appeared as prosecutor or witness at a preliminary examination, refuses to enter into a recognizance to appear at the trial to prosecute or give evidence, the Court may send him to prison, there to remain until after the trial, unless in the meantime he enters into a recognizance. (2) But if afterwards, from want of sufficient evidence or other cause, the accused is discharged, the Court shall order that the person imprisoned for so refusing be also discharged. (3) Where the prosecutor or witness is not a British subject, the Court may require him either to enter into a recognizance or to give other security for his attendance at the trial, and if ne fails to do so may in its discretion dismiss the charge. 56. Subject to Rules of Court made under this Order, the Court may order payment of allowances in respect of their reason able expenses to any complainant or witness attending before it on the trial of any criminal case, and also to jurors, assessors, interpreters, medical practitioners, or other persons employed in or in connection with criminal cases.iy Charges. 57. —( 1 ) The charge upon which an accused person is tried shall state the offence charged, with such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence, and the person (if any) against whom or the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged. (2) The fact that a charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case. (3) Where the nature of the case is such that the particulars above mentioned do not give such sufficient notice as aforesaid, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed as will give such sufficient notice. (4) For the purposes of the application of any Statute Law, a charge framed under the provisions of this Order shall be deemed to be an indictment. 58. For every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately, except in the cases following, that is to say :— (a) Where a person is accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from the first to the last of such offences, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, any number of them not exceeding three. (h) If in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction more offences than one are com mitted by the same person, he may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence. (c) If the acts alleged constitute an offence falling within two or more definitions or descriptions of offences in any law or laws, the accused may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, each of such offences. (d) If several acts constitute several offences, and also when combined a different offence, the accused may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, the offence constituted by such acts when combined, or one or more of the several offences, but in the latter case shall not be punished with more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could award for any one of those offences. (e) If a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences, and any number of such charges may be tried at once; or he may be charged in the alternative with having committed some one of the offences; and if it appears in evidence that he has committed a different20 offence for which he might have been charged, he may be convicted of that offence, though not charged with it. 59. \\ hen more persons than one are accused of the same offence or of different offences committed in the same transaction, or when one is accused of committing an offence and another of abetting or attempting to commit that offence, they may be charged and tried together or separately, as the Court thinks fit. 60. (1) Any Court, if sitting with a jury or assessors, may alter any charge at any time before the verdict of the jury is returned or the opinions of the assessors are expressed; if sitting without jury or assessors, at any time before judgment is pro nounced. (2) Every such alteration shall be read and explained to the accused. (3) If the altered charge is such that proceeding with the trial immediately is likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor, the Court may either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary. 61. — (1) No error or omission in stating either the offence or the particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material, unless the accused was misled by error or omission. ( 2 ) When the facts alleged in certain particulars are proved and constitute an offence, and the remaining particulars are not proved, the accused may be convicted of the offence constituted by the facts proved, although not charged with it. (3) When a person is charged with an offence, and the evidence proves either the commission of a minor offence or an attempt to commit the offence charged, he may be convicted of the minor offence or of the attempt. 62. — (1) If the accused has been previously convicted of any offence, and it is intended to prove such conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment which the Court is competent to award, the fact, date, and place of the previous conviction shall be stated in the charge. (2) If such statement is omitted, the Court may add it at any time before sentence is passed. (3) The part of the charge stating the previous convictions shall not be read out in Court, nor shall the accused be asked whether he has been previously convicted, as alleged in the charge, unless and until he has either pleaded guilty to, or been convicted of, the subsequent offence. (4) If he pleads guilty to, or is convicted of, the subsequent offence ,he shall then be asked whether he has been previously convicted, as alleged in the charge. (5) If he answers that he has been so previously convicted, the Court may proceed to pass sentence on him accordingly, but, if he denies that he has been so previously convicted, or refuses to, or does not, answer such question, the Court shall then inquire concerning such previous conviction, and in such case (where the trial is by jury) it shall not be necessary to swear the jurors again.V S \ MU 21 Punishments. 63. Save as is otherwise expressly provided, the powers of the Courts with respect to punishments are limited as follows:— (1) The Supreme Court may award in respect of an offence any punishment which may in respect of a similar offence be awarded in England : provided that (a) imprisonment with hard labour shall be substituted for penal servitude, and (b) the Supreme Court shall not award a fine exceeding £ 1 , 000 , or, in case of a continuing offence, in addition to imprisonment or fine, or both, a fine exceeding £10 for each day during which the offence continues after conviction. (2) A Provincial Court may award imprisonment, not exceeding twelve months, with or without hard labour, and with or without a fine not exceeding £ 100 ; or a fine not exceeding £ 100 , without imprisonment; or in case of a continuing offence, in addition to imprison ment or fine, or both, a fine not exceeding £2 for each day during which the offence continues after con viction. (3) But nothing in this Article shall be deemed to empower any Court to award for any offence any punishment not authorised by law in relation to that offence. 64. —(1) If a British subject is guilty of an offence against this Order not distinguished as a grave offence against this Order, he is liable :— (i) To a fine not exceeding £5, without imprisonment : or (ii) To imprisonment not exceeding one month, without fine; or (iii) To imprisonment not exceeding fourteen days, with a fine not exceeding 505.

(2) The Supreme Court may, also, if it thinks fit, on the application of any creditor, require before sealing that adequate security be given for the payment of debts due from the estate f to creditors residing in China. (3) For the purposes of this Article, a duplicate of any probate, letters of administration, or confirmation sealed with the seal of the Court granting the same, or a copy thereof certified as correct by or under the authority of the Court granting the same, shall have the same effect as the original.

(2) The Court within whose jurisdiction any property of the deceased is situate shall, where the circumstances of the case appear to the Court so to require, forthwith on his death, or ns soon after as may be, take possession of his property within the particular jurisdiction, or put 1 any such property under the seal of the Court (in either case, if the nature of the property or other circumstances so require, making an inventory), and so keep it until it can be dealt with according to law. 120. If any person named executor in a will takes possession of, and administers or otherwise deals with any part of the pro perty of the deceased, and does not obtain probate within one month after the death or after the termination of any proceedings respecting probate or administration, he shall be liable to pay double the amount of any fees chargeable on obtaining probate, and he shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding T1U0. 121. If any person, other than the person named executor or an administrator or an officer of the Court, takes possession of and administers or otherwise deals with any part of the property of a deceased British subject, whether resident or not, he shall be deemed guilty of a contempt of Court, and shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £50. 122. Where a person appointed executor in a will survives the testator, but either dies without having taken probate, or, having been called on by the Court to take probate, does not appear, his right in respect of the executorship wholly ceases; and without further renunciation the representation to the testator and the administration of his property shall go and may be committed as if that person had not been appointed executor. 123. — (1) Where a British subject dies in China, any other such subject having in his possession, or under his control, any paper or writing of the deceased, being or purporting to be testa mentary, shall forthwith bring the original to the Court within &lt; ] ] f 1 i 1 1 1 I &lt; 1 &lt; ] &lt; &lt;C 3 18642 39 whose particular jurisdiction the death happens, and deposit it there.

(3) Where it appears to the Court that there are reasonable grounds for believing that any person has knowledge of any paper being, or purporting to be, testamentary (although it is not shown that the paper is in his possession or under his control) the Court may, whether a suit or proceeding for probate or administration is pending or not, order that he be examined respecting it before the Court or elsewhere, and that he do attend for that purpose, and after examination order that he do produce the paper and deposit it in Court. 124. Where it appears to the Court that the value of the property or estate of a deceased person does not exceed £100, the Court may, without any probate or letters of administration, or other formal proceeding, pay thereout any debts or charges, and pay, remit, or deliver any surplus to such persons, subject to such conditions (if any) as the Court thinks proper, and shall not be liable to any action, suit, or proceedings in respect of anything done under this Article.

(3) An application for a rehearing shall be made within the prescribed time. Appeals to His Majesty in Council. 128. Subject to the provisions of this Order, an Appeal shall lie to His Majesty in Council— (1) As of right, from any final judgment of the hull Court made in a civil action, where the matter in dis pute on the Appeal amounts to or is of the value of £500 or upwards, or where the Appeal involves, directly or indirectly, some claim or question to or respecting property or some civil right amounting to or of the value of £500 or upwards; and (2) At the discretion of the Full Court, from any other judgment of the Full Court, whether final or in terlocutory, if, in the opinion of the Full Court, the question involved in the Appeal is one which, by reason of its great general or public importance or otherwise, ought to be submitted to His Majesty in Council for decision. 129.

Where the judgment appealed from requires the appellant to pay money or perform a duty, the Full Court shall have power, when granting leave to appeal, either to direct that the said judgment shall be carried into execution or that the execution thereof shall be suspended pending the Appeal, as to the Court shall seem just, and in case the Court shall direct the said judg ment to be carried into execution, the person in whose favour it was given shall, before the execution thereof, enter into good and sufficient security, to the satisfaction of the Court, for the due performance of such Order as His Majesty in Council shall think fit to make thereon. 132. The preparation of the Record shall be subject to the supervision of the Full Court, and the parties may submit any disputed question arising in connection therewith to the decision of the Court, and the Court shall give such directions thereon as the justice of the case may require. 133. The Registrar, as well as the parties and their legal agents, shall endeavour to exclude from the Record all documents (more particularly such as are merely formal) which are not relevant to the subject-matter of the Appeal, and, generally, to reduce the bulk of the Record as far as practicable, taking special care to avoid the duplication of documents and the unnecessary repetition of headings and other merely formal parts of documents; but the documents omitted to be copied or printed shall be enumerated in a list to be placed after the index or at the end of the Record. 134. Where in the course of the preparation of a Record one party objects to the inclusion of a document on the ground that it is unnecessary or irrelevant, and the other party nevertheless in sists upon its being included, the Record, as finally printed, shall with a view to the subsequent adjustment of the costs of and incidental to such document, indicate in the index of papers, or otherwise, the fact that, and the party by whom, the inclusion of the document was objected to. 135.

Where the Record is printed locally the Registrar shall, at the expense of the appellant, transmit to the Registrar of the Privy Council forty copies of such Record, one of which copies he shall certify to be correct by signing his name on, or initialling, every eighth page thereof, and by affixing thereto the seal of the Supreme Court. 137. Where the Record is to be printed in England, the Registrar shall, at the expense of the appellant, transmit to the Registrar of the Privy Council one certified copy of such Record, together with an index of all the papers and exhibits in the case. No other certified copies of the Record shall be transmitted to the agents in England by or on behalf of the parties to the Appeal. 138. Where part of the Record is printed locally and part is to be printed in England, Articles 136 and 137 shall, as far as' ■; ! V lx •iii 42 practicable, apply to such parts as are printed locally and such as are to be printed in England respectively. 139. The reasons given by the Judge, or any ^ to or against any judgment pronounced m con^ of the nroceedines out of which the Appeal arises, shall, unless t e) are included in the Kecord, be communicated “ ™ t ' ng b l ,y t judge or Judges to the Registrar and shall by him be trans mitfed to the Kegistrar of the Privy Council at the same tune when the Record is transmitted. 140. Where there are two or more appHcations for leave o anneal arising out of the same matter, and the lull ^ on ^ t of opinion that it would be for the convenien^ ot the tads of the Judicial Committee and all parties concerned that the App &lt; should be consohdated, the Court may direct the appeals to be con- solidated, and grant leave to appeal by a single order. 141. An appellant, who has obtained an order gianting nm conditional leave to appeal, may at any time prior to the making of an order granting him final leave to appeal hl ^PP^ on such terms as to costs and otherwise as the lull Court may direct. 142. Where an appellant, having obtained an order granting him conditional leave to appeal, and having 5 conditions imposed on him by such order, fails thereafter to apply with due diligence to the Full Court for an order granting him final leave to appeal, the Court may, on an application in that behalf made by the respondent, rescind the order granting ditional leave'to appeal, notwithstanding the appellant s com pliance with the conditions imposed by such order, and may give such directions as to the costs of the Appeal and the security entered into by the appellant as the Court shall think fit, or make each further or other order in the premises as, in the opinion of the Court, the justice of the case requires. 143 On an application for final leave to appeal, the Full Court may inquire whether notice, or sufficient notice, of the applica tion has been given by the appellant to all parties con cerned and, if not satisfied as to the notices given, may defer the granting of the final leave to appeal, or may give such other directions in the matter as, in the opinion of the Court, the justice of the case requires. 144. An appellant who has obtained final leave to appeal shall prosecute his appeal in accordance with the rules for the time being regulating the general practice and procedure in Appeals to His Majesty in Council. 145. Where an appellant, having obtained final leave to appeal, desires, prior to the dispatch of the Record to England, to withdraw his appeal, the Full Court may, upon an appli cation in that behalf made by the appellant, grant him a certih- cate to the effect that the Appeal has been withdrawn, and tne \ppeal shall thereupon be deemed, as from the date of such certificate, to stand dismissed without express Order ot His Majesty in Council, and the costs of the Appeal and the security T4o entered into by the appellant shall be dealt with in such manner as the Court may direct. 146. Where an appellant, having obtained final leave to appeal, fails to show due diligence in taking all necessary steps for the purpose of procuring the dispatch of the Record to England, the respondent may, after giving the appellant due notice of his intended application, apply to the Full Court for a certificate that the Appeal has not been effectually prose cuted by the appellant, and if the Court sees fit to grant such a certificate, the Appeal shall be deemed, as from the date of such certificate, to stand dismissed for non-prosecution without express Order of His Majesty in Council, and the costs of the Appeal and the security entered into by the appellant shall be dealt with in such manner as the Court may direct. 147. Where at any time between the Order granting final leave to appeal and the dispatch of the Record to England the Record becomes defective by reason of the death, or change of status, of a party to the Appeal, the Full Court ;may, not withstanding the order granting final leave to appeal, on an application in that behalf made by any person interested, grant a certificate showing who, in the opinion of the Court, is the proper person to be substituted or entered on the Recoid in place of, or in addition to, the party who has died, or undergone a change of status, and the name of such person shall thereupon be deemed to be so substituted or entered on the Record as aforesaid without express Order of His Majesty in Council. 148. Where the Record subsequently to its despatch to England becomes defective by reason of the death, or change of status, of a party to the Appeal, the Full Court shall, upon an applica tion in that behalf made by any person interested, cause a certifi cate to be transmitted to the Registrar of the Privy Council showing who, in the opinion of the Court, is the proper person to be substituted, or entered, on the Record, in place of, or m addi tion to, the party who has died or undergone a change of status 149. The case of each party to the Appeal may be printed either locally or in England, and shall, in either event, be printed in accordance with the rules in the First Schedule to this Order, every tenth line thereof being numbered in the margin, and shall be signed by at least one of the counsel who attends at the hear ing of the Appeal, or by the party himself if he conducts his Appeal in person. 150. The Case shall consist of paragraphs numbered consecu tively, and shall state, as concisely as possible, the circumstances out of which the Appeal arises, the contentions to be urged by the party lodging the same, and the reasons of appeal. References by page and line to the relevant portions of the Record as printed shall, as far as practicable, be printed in the margin, and care shall be taken to avoid, as far as possible, the reprinting in the Case of long extracts from the Records. The taxing officer, in taxing the costs of the Appeal, shall, either of his own motion, or at the instance of the opposite party, inquireinto any unnec€ssary prolixity in th© Case, and shall disallow the costs occasioned thereby. 151. Where the Judicial Committee directs a party to bear the costs of an Appeal incurred in China, such costs shall be taxed by the proper officer of the Supreme Court in accordance with the rules for the time being regulating taxation in the Supreme Court. 152. The Supreme Court shall execute any Order which His Majesty in Council may think fit to make on an Appeal from a judgment of the Full Court in like manner as any original judgment of the Supreme Court should or might have been executed. 153. This Order shall not affect the right of His Majesty in Council at any time, on the humble petition of a person aggrieved by a decision of the Full Court, to admit his appeal on such terms and in such manner as His Majesty in Council may think fit, and to deal with the decision appealed from in such manner as may be just.

Registered bills of sale affecting the same chattels have as among themselves priority in order of registration. 176. Chattels comprised in a registered bill of sale are not in the possession, order, or disposition of the grantor within the law of bankruptcy. 177. If in any case there is an unregistered bill of sale, and within or on the expiration of the time by this Order allowed for registration thereof a subsequent bill of sale is granted affecting the same or some of the same chattels, for the same or part of the same debt, then the subsequent bill is, to the extent to which it comprises the same chattels and is for the same debt, absolutely void, unless the Court is satisfied that the subsequent bill is granted in good faith for the purpose of correcting some material error in the^prior bill, and not for the purpose of unlawfully evading the operation of this Order. 178.
