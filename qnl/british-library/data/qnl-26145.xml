Instructions passed under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet to the Govenor and Commander-in-Chief of the Colony of Aden. DATED 3rd March, 1937. GEORGE R.I. Instructions to Our Governor and Commander-in-Chief in and over the Colony of Aden, or other officer for the time being adminis tering the Government of the said Colony. Whereas by the Aden Colony Order, 1936, provision is made for the Government of the Colony of Aden (therein and hereinafter called “ the Colony ”) and for the appointment of a Governor and Commander-in-Chief (therein and hereinafter called “ the Governor ”) in and over the Colony; And whereas the Governor is thereby authorised, empowered and commanded to do all things that belong to his said office, according to such Instructions as may from time to time be given to him under Our Sign Manual and Signet; And whereas We are minded to issue Instructions under Our Sign Manual and Signet for the guidance of the Governor or other officer administering the Government of the Colony; NOW THEREFORE We do direct and enjoin and declare Our will and pleasure as follows :— 1. The Governor may, whenever he thinks fit, require any person in the public service of the Colony to take the Oath of Allegiance, in the form prescribed by the above recited Order, together with such other Oath or Oaths as may from time to time be prescribed by any laws in force in the Colony. The Governor is to administer such Oaths, or to cause them to be administered by some public officer of the Colony. 2. During the temporary absence of the Governor from the seat of Government or from the Colony these Instructions, so far as they apply to any matter or thing to be done, or to any power or authority to be exercised by a Deputy acting for the Governor, shall be deemed to be addressed to and shall be observed by such Deputy. 3. If in any emergency arising in the Colony during the tem porary absence of the Governor for a short period from the seat of Government or from the Colony it is necessary that instructions should be obtained from Us without delay, the Deputy (if any) acting for the Governor may apply to Us, through one of Our Principal Secretaries o^ State, for instructions in the matter; but every such Deputy shall forthwith transmit to the Governor a copy of every despatch or communication which he has so addressed Governor to administer oaths.

(3) If any Member of the Council holding public office in the Colony under the Crown shall cease so to hold office, his seat m the Council shall thereupon become vacant. (4) Whenever upon any special occasion the Governor desires to obtain the advice of any person within the Colony relating to affairs therein, he may summon such person, for such special occasion, as an Extraordinary Member of the Council. 5. Whenever any Member, other than an ex officio Member, shall bv writing under his hand resign his seat in the Executive Council, or shall die, or whenever the seat of any such Member shall other wise become vacant, or whenever any such Member shall be sus pended from the exercise of his functions as a Member of the Executive Council, or be declared by the Governor by an Instrument under the Public Seal to be incapable of exercising his functions as a Member of the Council, or be absent from the Colony, or shall be acting in an office the holder of which is an ex officio Member of the Council, the Governor may, by an Instrument under the Public Seal, appoint some person to be provisionally a Member of the Council in the place of such Member. Such person shall forthwith cease to be a Member of the said Council if his appointment is disallowed by Us, or revoked by the Governor or superseded by the definitive appointment of a Member of the Council, or if the Member in whose place he was appointed shall be released from suspension, or, as the case may be, shall be declared by the Governor capable of again discharging his functions in the Council, or shall return to the Colony, or shall cease to sit in the Council as an ex officio Member.When any person shall be lawfully discharging the functions of both of the offices the holders of which are ex officio Members of the said Council, the Governor may, by an Instrument under the Public Seal, appoint any fit person to be provisionally a Member of the Council so long as the said offices shall continue to be discharged by one person but any such appointment may be disallowed as aforesaid. 6 . The Governor shall, without delay, report to Us, through one Provisional of Our Principal Secretaries of State, every provisional appoint- be ment of any person as a Member of the said Executive Council. repor t e a. Every such person shall hold his place in the Council during Our pleasure, and the Governor may, by an Instrument under the Public Seal, revoke any such appointment. 7. The Members of the Executive Council shall have precedence Precedence as We may specially assign, and, in default thereof, first the ex of Members. officio Members, in the order in which their offices are above- mentioned, then other Members (other than Extraordinary Mem bers) according to the priority of their respective appointments, or, if appointed by the same Instrument, according to the order in which they are named therein, and finally Extraordinary Members. 8 . The Governor shall forthwith communicate these Our Instruc- Governor tions to the Executive Council, and likewise all such others, from to commun- time to time, as We may direct or as he shall find convenient for Our Auctions service to impart to them. to Council. 9. The Executive Council shall not proceed to the despatch of Council not business unless duly summoned by authority of the Governor, nor to proceed unless two Members at the least (exclusive of the Governor or of the other Member presiding) be present and assisting throughout ™ ^ the whole of the meetings at which any such business shall be Governor’s despatched. authority.

In the execution of the powers and authorities granted to the Governor by the above recited Order or otherwise he shall in all cases consult with the Executive Council, excepting only in cases which may be of such a nature that, in his judgment, Our service would sustain material prejudice by consulting the Council there upon, or when the matters to be decided shall be too unimportant to require their advice, or too urgent to admit of their advice being given by the time within which it may be necessary for him to act in respect of any such matters. In all such urgent cases he shall, at the earliest practicable period, communicate to the Executive Council the measures which he may so have adopted, with the reasons therefor. 13. The Governor alone shall be entitled to submit questions to the Executive Council for their advice or decision ; but if the Gov ernor decline to submit any question to the Council when requested in writing by any Member so to do, it shall be competent to such Member to require that there be recorded upon the Minutes his written application, together with the answer returned by the Governor to the same. 14. The Governor may act in opposition to the advice given to him by the Members of the Executive Council, if he shall in any case deem it right to do so; but in any such case he shall fully report the matter to Us by the first convenient opportunity, with the grounds and reasons of his action. In every such case, it shall be competent to any Member of the Council to require that there be recorded at length on the Minutes the grounds of any advice or opinion he may give upon the question. 15 15. In the enactment of laws within the Colony, We do hereby direct and enjoin that the Governor shall observe, as far as practicable, the following Rules and Regulations (that is to say) :— (1) All laws to be enacted by the Governor shall be styled “ Ordinances enacted by the Governor of the Colony of Aden.” (2) All Ordinances shall be distinguished by titles, and shall be divided into successive clauses or paragraphs consecutively numbered, and to every clause there shall be annexed in the margin a short summary of its contents. The Ordinances of each year shall be distinguished by consecutive numbers commencing in each year with the number one. (3) Each different matter shall be provided for by a different Ordinance without intermixing in one and the same Ordinance such things as have no proper relation to each other ; and no clause is to be inserted in or annexed to any Ordinance which shall be foreign to what the title of such Ordinance imports, and no perpetual clause shall be part of any temporary Ordinance.(4) No Ordinance shall, without the prior consent of one of Publication Our Principal Secretaries of State, be enacted unless a draft of draft, of the same shall first have been made public for one calendar month at the least before the enactment thereof, unless such immediate enactment shall in the judgment of the Governor be indispensably necessary for the security of the Colony, or the welfare of Our subjects or others residing within the same. 16. The Governor shall not unless he shall have previously Des ^ ri P tlon obtained instructions thereupon from one of Our ^ Principal ^ Secretaries of State, or unless the Ordinance shall contain a clause assente( j to&gt; suspending its operation until the signification of Oui pleasure thereupon, enact any Ordinance of any of the following classes, namely :— (1) Any Ordinance for the divorce of persons joined together in holy matrimony; (2) Any Ordinance whereby any grant of land or money or other donation or gratuity may be made to himself ; (3) Any Ordinance whereby any increase or diminution may be made in the number, salary or allowances of the public officers; (4) Any Ordinance affecting the currency of the Colony or relating to the issue of Bank Notes ; (5) Any Ordinance establishing any Banking Association, or amending or altering the constitution, powers, or privileges of any Banking Association; (6) Any Ordinance imposing import or export duties or any additional taxation ; (7) Any Ordinance the provisions of which shall appear in consistent with obligations imposed upon Us by Treaty, (8) Any Ordinance interfering with the discipline or control of Our forces by land, sea or air; (9) Any Ordinance of an extraordinary nature and import ance whereby Our prerogative or the rights and property of Our subjects not residing in the Colony, or the tiade and shipping of any part of Our dominions or any territory under Our protection may be prejudiced ; (10) Any Ordinance whereby persons not of European birth or descent may be subjected or made liable to any disabilities or restrictions to which persons of European birth oi descent are not also subjected or made liable ; (11) Any Ordinance containing provisions to which Our assent has been once refused, or which have been disallowed by Us.

When any Ordinance shall have been enacted by the Governor, he shall forthwith transmit to Us through one of Our Principal Secretaries of State a full and exact copy in duplicate of the same duly authenticated under the Public Seal and by his own signature. Such copy shall be accompanied by such explanatory observations as may be required to exhibit the reasons and occasion for passing such Ordinance. 18. At the earliest practical period at the commencement of each year, the Governor shall cause a complete collection to be published, for general information, of all Ordinances enacted during the preceding year. 19. Before disposing of any vacant or waste lands to Us belong ing the Governor shall cause such reservations to be made thereout as he may think necessary for roads or other public purposes. The Governor shall not, directly or indirectly, purchase for himself any land or buildings to Us belonging without special permission given to him on that behalf through one of Our Principal Secretaries of State. 20.

The Governor shall not pardon or reprieve any such offender unless it shall appear to him expedient so to do upon receiving the advice of the Executive Council thereon ; but in all such cases he is to decide either to extend or to withhold a pardon or reprieve, according to his own deliberate judgment, whether the Members of the Executive Council concur therein or otherwise ; entering, nevertheless, on the Minutes of the Executive Council a Minute of his reasons at length, in case he should decide any such question in opposition to the judgment of the majority of the Members thereof.(2964 -7) Wt. 29231—3758 75 3/37 P.

It being Our intention that all persons inhabiting the Colony Liberty of should have full liberty of conscience and the free exercise of their conscience respective modes of religious worship, We do hereby require the Governor to permit all persons within the Colony to have such liberty, and to exercise such modes of religious wmrship, provided they be content with a quiet and peaceable enjoyment of the same, not giving offence or scandal to the Government. 23. The Governor shall punctually forward to Us from year to Blue Book, year, through one of Our Principal Secretaries of State, the annual book of returns, commonly called the Blue Book, relating to the Revenue and Expenditure, Public Works, Legislation, Civil Estab lishments, Pensions, Population, Schools, Course of Exchange, Imports and Exports, Agricultural Produce, Manufactures, and other matters in the said Blue Book more particularly specified, with reference to the state and condition of the Colony. 24.

Fy dear Parkinson, e have no comments on eilly’s draft speech, except for the following on a minor point of fact in regard to salt. he future policy of India regarding Aden salt will, as a matter of fact, depend as much on the Government of India as on the Legislature or perhans more, since the ovemment of India could, if it decided to do so, extend the exemption from the Indian additional duty by notification, suggest that in the sentence beginning [The future policy of India and* before the words ’’the Indian Legislature and substitute * them n for ’that body*. t insert the words *th© Government of (Sgd.) J.C. Walton. Sir C* Parkinson,Last two lines of page 2. A s I understand the matter the future policy of India regarding Aden salt will depend more on the Government than on the Legis lature. The Government of India could extend its exemption from the Indian Additional Duty hy Notifica tion whereas the Legislature can only deal effectively with the question if it is brought before them by the Government. I think it would be correct to say 'the future policy of India regarding Indian salt must be decided by the Government of India and the Indian Legislature and I hope that favourable consideration will be given by those bodies to the claims 11 . I suppose we should suggest this change since the draft speech has been referred to us though I do not imagine any harm would have been done if no reference to the India Office had been made and this part of the draft speech had remained unchanged. _ _ - —f 9th ^arch, 1937 Immediate , My dear Walton, I think you may like to see in the India Of lice the draft of the speech which Reilly proposes to make when he is sworn in as Governor at Aden on the 1st April. We shall be letting him know about the King* s message, ana the four blanks in the opening passage ol the speech do not matter for the moment. We are quite content with the draft here, and I do not think that you are likely to have any criticisms. Perhaps you Vvould let me have a telephone message in reply to this, as I want to get off an answer by the mail which leaves on Thursday. J.C. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C.Draft of Speech to be made by the Governor at Aden at the swearing in ceremony on the 1st April, 1937. Your Highness, uadies ana Gentlemen, His Majesty the King has been graciously pleased to send a message to the people of Aden, which I have the honour to read to you. I propose to send the following reply for submission to His Majesty I have also received a message from His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India in the following terms To this message I am sending the following reply Aden is today entering a new phase in its history. After nearly a century of tutelage under the Government of Bombay and the Government of India it has now attained the status of a separate Colony directly under the British Crown. This event will place increased responsibilities on its Administration and its people, notably in the fc.ct that it must henceforth rely primarily on its own resources lor thethe maintenance of its civil administration and for its future development. These added responsibilities will involve certain inevitable changes, but it is the intention of His Majesty’s Government that there should be as great a degree of continuity as possible in the machinery and methods of Government. This policy of continuity will he followed in the retention of the spirit, and in most cases of the letter, of existing laws and regulations, in the preservation in judicial cases of the right of appeal to the High Court of Bombay, in the continued use of Indian Currency, and in the maintenance of the policy inaugurated in the middle of last century by the East India Company, under which Aden was established as a free port. In order that the political severance from India should place no obstacle in the long established and important business relations between Aden ana that country, it has been arranged that Indian inland postage rates should remain in force between India and Aden, a provision that I hope will be appreciated especially by the Indian Commercial Community. A very important item of Aden’s trade with India is the export of salt, and at present approxi mately half the salt imported into India by sea is produced in Aden. This is due, among other causes, to the fact that the Indian additional salt duty has not hitherto been levied on Aden salt, and it will not be levied on it during the next twelve months. The future policy of India regarding Aden salt must be decided by the Indian Legislature, and I hope that favourable— mm-- *' favourable consideration will be given by that Body to the claims ol the Aden salt industry and to the representations that have been made on its behalf. Aden is now on the threshold of a new period in its development. During the past hundred years it has grown steadily under British rule, and has been established as an important commercial centre for the transit and transhipment of goods to and from neighbouring countries. Its trade has grown on the foundation of free imports, on the basis of which the energy and enterprise of its merchants and business men, fostered by the wise and progressive policy of its Port Administration, have built up a. solid structure of mercantile an commercial prosperity. At the same time Aden is a place of primary strategic value to the Empire, and its geographical position on the great trade route between Eruope and the East, and its comparative proximity to the oil fields in Iran, have enabled it to become one of the greatest oil fuelling ports. These should be permanent factors that will ensure the continuance of its importance in the future, and it must be our tasn to do all that we can to facilitate and promote its prosperity and the welfare of its inhabitants. For this purpose I hope to be able to rely on that cordial co-operation ana mutual goodwill of all races, communities ana classes that have been a happy characteristic of Aden in the past, and I look to the two bocal Bodies to assist the new Administration in the development of services of public utility and social improvement. Among these the advancement of local education, to which the Executive Committee of the Aden Settlement have latelylately given increased interest and greater practical help, is an outstanding and urgent example. Under these conditions I feel that Aden can look with confidence to its future, and can take its place as the Empire’s youngest Colony with a determination to uphold and enhance its reputation of peaceful progress and contentment in unswerving loyalty to the British Crown.Draft Paper P.Z.1318/37 Department. , CMG. , H.R.

I think you have a private file on this subject and that the question is linked up with that of a. message to Burma. So far as this draft goes it seems to be suitable, subject to any comments which you may have to make, particularly in regard to the last paragraph about the visit to India. But no doubt the draft should be looked at in conjunction with the Burma draft. I understand that the reference to a possible visit to Aden was inserted on the instructions of the Colonial Office higher authorities and as a result of d.o. letter from Sir Bernard Reilly to Sir Cosmo Parkinson, in which Sir Bernard suggested that if anything could be said about the King calling at Aden on his way to India it would I have an exceedingly good effect locally. submit the draft message to the King as soon as possible.

That political association with My Indian Smpire will now he broken, and Aden will take its place in My Colonial Empire; hut the ties of commerce and personal association will remain, and I look forward confidently to Aden continuing to enjoy in the future, as a colony, the prosperity which it has enjoyed in the past.

As regards your first point, I see no objection to inserting the passage you suggest regarding Indian personnel. Objection may be seen to your second suggestion on the ground that the despatch deals otherwise exclusively with the Colony; but as it would perhaps be inconvenient to refer, in the despatch about the Aden Protectorate Order, to the position of Indians, I think that we can add a paragraph to the Colony despatch on the lines you suggest.

I might be added m para. 5 of the draft to the effect that, in regard to the entry of Indians into the Aden Protectorate/ 5319cProtectorate, precisely the same conditions will apply as in the case of any other British subjects (see the last paragraph of your letter quoted above).

The Order and Royal Instructions are, in great part, on the lines familiar m o ther Colonies; but they contain certainthat the territory v/as formerly a Chief Commissioner’s Province under the Government of India, and in particular to give effect to certain pledges which were given 'by His Majesty’s Government and by the Government of India while the transfer was under consideration. 5. Those pledges fell under six main heads. (l) India would be relieved of the contribution at present payable towards the cost of the military and political administration. The necessary financialEffect is given to this by section 20 of the Order. (o) The existing policy of keeping Aden as a free port would be maintained, unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place. (4) His Majesty’s Government would maintain the present standard of adminis tration and would not impose additional taxation unless such a course became in their opinion absolutely necessary. While it is impossible to define the -present standard of administra tion, and its maintenance must be the responsibility of the Governor, provision is made in section 16 of the Royal Instructions to secure that no import or export duties, or additional taxation, rnay be imposed without the prior approval of the Secretary of State. (5) A proportion of Indian Service personnel would be retained for some yearsyears. This will secured oy administrative arrangements, and is not formally laid down in the Order or Royal Instructions.

Under the Government of India Act, 1935, it is required that the draft Aden Order, 1936, which makes provision for the Govern ment of Aden, shall be laid before Parliament. In supplement to that Order it will be necessary to issue Royal Instructions to the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Colony of Aden. While it is not ordinarily the practice to lay before Parliament the draft of such ' Instructions prior to their issue, it is felt that it would be proper in this case to lay the Instructions in draft simultaneous! with the draft Aden Order. ^ ■ fall Liter or ^ '.o peentwe Count t J Warrants t i my, by ar irstteUor;3 nu att OF INSTRUCTIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE COLONY OF ADEN. it is The Governor may, whenever he thinks fit, require any person i ^ b iic service of the Colony to take the Oath of Allegiance, ^ 'i- ■ )nn prescribed by the above recited Order, together with 1U Vnther Oath or Oaths as may from time to time be prescribed i nv laws in force in the Colony. The Governor is to administer such Oaths, or to cause them to be administered by some public officer of the Colony. 2 During the temporary absence of the Governor from the seat ijn,».![ „ f Government or from the Colony these Instructions, so far as L tL annlv to any matter or thing to be done, or to any power or A!!hauthority to be exercised by a Deputy acting for the Governor, £ be deemed to be addressed to and shall be observed by such rlwu. Dep ^ ^ emergency arising in the Colony during the tem- oorary absence of the Governor for a short period from the seat of Government or from the Colony it is necessary that instructions should be obtained from Us without delay, the Deputy (if any) acting for the Governor may apply to Us, through one of Our Principal Secretaries of State, for instructions in the matter, but every such Deputy shall forthwith transmit to the Governor a copy of every despatch or communication which he has so addressed to Us. 4 _( 1 ) The Executive Council of the Colony shall consist of the officers lawfully discharging the functions of Political Secretary and Civil Secretary, who shall be styled ex officio Members, and such other persons as may from time to time be appointed by Us by any Instructions or Warrants under Our Sign Manual and Signet, or as the Governor may, by an Instrument under the Public Seal of the Colony, appoint in pursuance of instructions from Us through one of Our Principal Secretaries of State, or as the Governor may provisionally appoint in the manner hereinafter provided. (2) Every such Member of the Executive Council, not being an ex officio Member or a Member provisionally appointed, shall, subject to the provisions of Section 11 of the Aden Order, 1936, hold office for the term stated in the Instrument appointing him, or if no term is so stated, for a period of three years from the date of such Instrument, but any Member whose term of office shall have expired may be re-appointed. (3) If any Member of the Council holding public office in the Colony under the Crown shall cease so to hold office, his seat in the Council shall thereupon become vacant. (4) Whenever upon any special occasion the Governor desires to obtain the advice of any person within the Colony relating to affairs therein, he may summon such person, for such special occasion, as an Extraordinary Member of the Council.5. Whenever any Member, other than an ex officio Member, bv writing under his hand resign his seat in the Executive Council, or shall die, or whenever the seat of any such Member shall other wise become vacant, or whenever any such Member shall be sus pended from the exercise of his functions as a Member of tb Executive Council, or be declared by the Governor by an Instr^’;;; under the Public Seal to be incapable of exercising his functions as a Member of the Council, or be absent from the Colony, or shall be acting in an office the holder of which is an ex officio Member of the Council, the Governor may, by an Instrument under the Public Seal, appoint some person to be provisionally a Member of the Council in the place of such Member. Such person shall forthwith cease to be a Member of the said Council if his appointment is disallowed by Us, or revoked by the Glovernor or superseded by the definitive appointment of a Member of the Council, or if the Member in whose place he was appointed shall be released from suspension, or, as the case may be, shall be declared by the Governor capable of again discharging his functions in the Council, or shall return to the Colony, or shall cease to sit in the Council as an ex officio Member. When any person shall be lawfully discharging the functions of both of the' offices the holders of which are ex officio Members of the said Council, the Governor may, by an Instrument under the Public Seal, appoint any fit person to be provisionally a Member of the Council so long as the said offices shall continue to be discharged by one person but any such appointment may be disallowed as aforesaid. 6. The Governor shall, without delay, report to Us, through one of Our Principal Secretaries of State, every provisional appoint ment of any person as a Member of the said Executive Council. Every such person shall hold his place in the Council during Our pleasure, and the Governor may, by an Instrument under the Public Seal, revoke any such appointment. 7. The Members of the Executive Council shall have precedence as We may specially assign, and, in default thereof, first the ex officio Members, in the order in which their offices are above- mentioned, then other Members (other than Extraordinary Mem bers) according to the priority of their respective appointments, or, if appointed by the same Instrument, according to the order in which they are named therein, and finally Extraordinary Members. 8 .

Tintp sunt)!led by the India Office for the information of the India and Burma Orders Committee. The problem presented, in connexion with Indian constitutional reform, by the future government of the Settlement of Aden, which has long been treated as part of British India and is at present a Chief Commissioner^ province, was considered at length by the Joint Select Committee in paragraphs 160-162 of their Report, where lull reasons were given for their recommendation 'that the administration of the Settlement of Aden should be transferred from the Government of India to His Majesty's Government not later than the date of the establishment of Federation 11 . Accordingly in s.94 of the Government of India Act, 1965, in which are enumerated the Chief Commissioners provinces, provision was made that Aden should cease to be part of India, while by s.283 power was conferred upon His Majesty in Council to determine the date upon which the separation of Aden should take place and to make such provision as might be deemed proper for the government Aden after that date. This Order is made in pursuance of the provisions of the last mentioned section, and the effect of the Order fix 1st April, 1937 - the same date as that fixed -tor the commencement of Part III of the Act - as the ^.pointed as , and to set up in Aden the standard form of Cro^n Colony government under a Governor assisted by an Executive Council. In two respects only do the. provisions of the Order differ from those which normally apply in analogous cas(i) Section 288 requires inter alia (subsection (4)) that appellate jurisdiction from Courts in Aden shall be conferred upon such Court in India as may be specified in the Order. The draft Order accordingly contains provisions (paragraph 20) which will substantially maintain the existing relations between the High Court at Bombay and the District and Sessions Court at Aden - now to be converted (paragraph 15 of the Order) into the Supreme Court of the Colony. This arrangement implements the undertaking given by His Majesty’s Government, when the separation of Aden was decided upon (mid endorsed by the Joint Select Committee in their Report) that the existing rights of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court would be preserved. (ii) The Order contains a provision (paragraph 21) which reproduces mutatis mutandis the provisions of s.298(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, with the addition, however, (page 7, line 6) of the words 'from entering Aden or'. The object of this paragraph is to give effect to a further undertalcing given by His Majesty’s Government (also endorsed by the Joint Select Committee) that there shall be no racial discrimination or segregation. Further undertakings were given that the transfer would involve for Aden no additional taxation unless, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, such a course were absolutely necessary, and that the existing policy of waking Aden a free port would be maintained. These undertakings will be implemented by provisions in the Instructions to the Governor forbidding him to enact without previous instructions from the Secretary of State any ordinance which he proposes 'imposing import or export duties or any additional taxation'.Record of a meeting held at the Colonial Office on the 50th June to consider further the draft Aden Order in Council and the draft Royal Instructions* PRSSEKT : Sir Grattan Bushe Mr. Cowell Mr* Roherts-V/ray Mr* Blaster Sir Herbert Pearson Sir Vernon Dawson ) India Off^ 06 -^ Mr. Walton ) Mr* Claus on .. ) Sir Bernard Reilly Resident and Chief Goramissloner at Aden* \ Discu-ssion took place regarding the procedure for laying the draft Order in Council before parliament* Sir Grat ta n Bushe stated that the Colonial Office had considered the suggestion made at the previous meeting that it might be advisable also to lay the draft Royal ms trac tions, and that the Colonial Office agreed mm .it be desirable to do this* The India Ofxice Order in Council and the Colonial Office tne draf c Royal Instructions.

(in the Chair) Colonial Office,considered, together with the comments which had been received from the Government of Bombay and the Government of India* Sir Grattan Bushe stated that, in spite of the contentions in the latest telegrams from the Government of India, the Golonial Office remained of the opinion that the existing revisionary powers of the Bombay High Court should not be perpetuated. He did not think that it was possible to sustain the argument of the Government of India that if these powers and powers of confirmation of death sentences were excluded, this would he contrary to the spirit of the pledge given hy Hie rajesty f s Government. He referred to the wording of section 2^8 (4) of the Government of India Act, 1935, and pointed out that provision was made merely for appellate jurisdiction from Courts in Aden upon a Court in India, and for the Court in India upon which such jurisdiction is conferred to exercise that jurisdiction. The status of the Court at Aden would be changed after the transfer of Aden to that of supreme Court of the Colony. It might be that the same official would remain as Judge of the Court for a period hut the assumption made by the Government of India that his status would be equivalent uc that of District and sessions Judge was incorrect, entirely contrary to normal practice to give the Court the powers of revision and confirmation which were desired by the Government of India. The Qfflce representatives argued that it was very desirable that, in order not to alienate main opinion, the powers of the High Court at Bomba, preserved as far as possible* The position mign by preserving the existing powers of the High Court Bombay for a transitional period only and then a couldcould 'be made to the normal practice of providing for appeals only. It was the intention in other matters relating to the transfer not to make a u clean cut s? at once hut to provide that the change-over should take place gradually. Y/ould it not he possible to take the same line in this case also? sir G rattan Bnshe thought that it might well he more difficult to make the change in a few years r time than at the present. Sir G-rattan Bnshe said that the provisions in the new draft of clause 20 already gave in substance all that was desired. Indeed, the rights of appeal provided for in the revised draft of clause 20 were more extensive than those provided for under Regulation No. 6 of 1933* The provision, for example t , confining appeals in criminal cases to sentences of six months or over had not been included. Sir Herbert Pearson pointed out that the existing powers of confirmation in death sentences gave more extensive power to the High Court than would be conferreu by a right of appeal. In the former ease the Court could review all the facts, whereas in the latter case they would be confined to points of law, misdirection, etc. Mr. Roberts-Wray pointed out that there was nothing in the Order itself to confine appeals to questions of law. Si r Bernard Reilly observed that there was a growing feeling at Aden that appeals to the High ^ouxt Bombay should be rather more restricted and it was agreed that the proviso to section 36 of Regulation No. 6 of should be restored. He mentioned also that the Judges had recently served at Aden had been comparatively Junior officials. Sir Bernar dSir Bex^iard Reill y mentioned also that* particularly In capital cases* both the judge and jury welcomed the fact that their decisions had to he confirmed hy the High Court at Bombay* Sir Gr at tan Bnshe stated that he still saw considerable difficulty in meeting the views of the India Office and the Government of India* He suggested* however* that the wishes of the Government of India might to some extent be met if provision were made that in capital cases if an appeal was not lodged* the record of the case sno oj.G be sent to the High Court at Bombay and should be treated as an appeal* It was eventually agreed that a provision on the following lines should be inserted after clause 20 (1) (b):- **When any person is sentenced to death and no anneal has been lodged by him within the time liiai ted for that purpose * the Supreme Court shall transmit the record of the case to the High Court and an anpeal shall thereby be deemed to have been lodged by the said person; anu the sentence shall not be carried out unless and unuil it shall have been confirmed by the High Court*. and that instead of giving the High Court the powers mentioned in section 3? (2) of the Aden civil and i Justice Order* 1935* the Order should contain a general provision giving that Court in all appeals under the same powers as it possessed under the Indian ---a a Tpeals from Indian Courts* Mr* Walton referred to sub-clause w (i/ clause 30. He thought that this sub-clause mXanu Ml!e impression that the Governor could Ordinance remove fhe rights of appeal conferred by the order in Council. explainedexplained that the sub-clause was inserted merely in order to rdve the Governor power to make minor amendments If required. There was* of course 5 no intention that he should use the provision in order to nullify the general effect of clause 20. Rdberts-Tray drew attention to the reference in sub-clauses 1(a) (1) and 1(b) to the Indian Code of Civil Procedure* 1908 p and the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure* 1898* rt as amended prior to the aopointed day* 4 * and pointed out that amendments might be made to the Indian Code which it would be desirable to make operative in respect of Aden by an Ordinance under sub-clause (4) (i). It was agreed, however, that the sub—clause might be open to misconstruction and that m miv, event of amendments of the type envisaged being required an amending Order in Council would be necessary® j. c \icx^ unlikely that it would be a matter of urgency to introduce amendments of this kind. It was decided, tnerei ore f that sub-clause 4 (i) should be omitted® It was also agreed that the words ^general or public' in sub-clause 1(a) (ii) of clause 20 should, be omitted. The question was raised whether clause ou (gian- of pardons) conflicted with the provisions in sections 401 and 408 of the Indian Criminal Code and sections - tj39A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 189d* I- - that this could be dealt with in the adaptation Ordinance which would be passed by the Governor immediately on the entry into foi i ee of the new regime.

At the meeting with the C.O. on 30th June we pressed for the retention of the revisional jurisdiction of the Bombay High 'ourt in regard to appeals In civil cases, and also for continuance of the power of confirming death sentences. The C.O. representatives urged strongly that it would be undesirable to retain powers of the Bombay High Court which would in form be derogatory to the new Supreme Court at Aden; the latter, though in character and personnel it will remain much the same, will cease to be a subordinate court (except m so far as appeals will lie from it to a court in India, in accordance with the pledge given); the present provision that the Bombay high Court may call for the record of any civil case to see whether the District Judge has exceeded his powers, or failed to exercise his jurisdiction, or has exercised it illegally or irregularly, would appear to be derogatory to the status of an independent court. The o- for the Colonies, therefore, is unwilling that this power should be retained. There is some force in the C.O. point of view on the question of ton,. On tho other hand, «e have gained a great deal of wbrtance. ».t e«U « tl » existing .Wairprt.»U ** ^ been willing to provide for appeals m any otner cases with permission either of the Supreme Court at Aden or of the High Court at Bombay; they stated that they were willing to make this provision in terms as wide as ™ pleased; the wording of the present draft oec. ^ ^ 1is, in virtue of the words 'or otherwise', so wide that it is clear that the Bombay High Court could give leave to appeal in any class' of case in which it wished to hear an appeal. On the question of the confirmation of death sentences ( ’inch from the publicity point of view might be of some value) the C.O. met us by agreeing to the insertion of the new subsection ( 2 ) in '-ec. 20 . The provision in the draft section empowering the Governor to limit or define jadgnents from which appeals may be brought has been omitted, as we pointed out that it might have the appearance of taking away with, one nand what had been given with the other. The intention o± unis provision was to enable the Governor to bring the law at Aden into line with any changes that might be made in the law in India in respect of appeals^ without its ueing necessary for that purpose to make an amendment o: the 0. in 0. As occasions for altering the law at Aden in regard to such details may not arise, and in any case will not be matters of urgency, it was thought not worth while to make a provision which would be so liable to be misunderstood. . r ^ a z „ ^ \ mi n _ T ,-3 a 4- V. t vi. -P . i v-i-f- Vi o Vi n . t4' O ?he G. of I. have said nothing further about a contribution from Aden towards the expense of the Bombay High Court, but have passed on a suggestion by the Govt, of Bombay that provision should be made m the Order lor the recovery of fees by the High Court.

In order to save time I had already had the unrevised draft set up in type, erobodying, however, a few of the smaller corrections agreed on at the last meeting.

I have ventured to omit the side-notes in order to maintain the ssrae form for this Order as for all our other Orders under the Act. C.T.Carr, the Editor of the Statutory Rules and ( Orders, tells me that he would like 'Aden' instead of 'India” as the series heading of this Order, vSiich appears for the purposes of the Statutory Buies and Orders only.

The draft as at present revised is at flag H. with Art. 20, which deals with the appeals to the Bombay High Court provided for by Sec. 288(4) of the G. of I. Act, 1935. The preservation of the right of appeal to the Bombay High Court was one of the undertakings given by H.M.G. in the hope of reconciling Indian opinion to the transfer of Aden (see para. 162 of the report of the J.S.C.). The Act accordingly makes it mandatory to confer appellate jurisdiction on such court in India as may be specified. The article of the 0. in C. as drafted | provides for the continuance of appeals from the Court at Aden (which will be called the Supreme Court) to the Bombay High Court in cases where they lie at present, and further for appeals with the leave of the Supreme Court or the High Court in certain other civil cases. (c) an obligation on the Sessions court at Aden to submit death sentences to the Bombay High Oouru xor confirmation. The question is whether these powers of revision, reference and confirmation should be preserved. At/ There is a point still unsettled in connection At present, in addition to the right of appeal from the District and Sessions Judge at Aden to the Bombay High Court, there exist (a) a. revisional power of the High Court in civil cases where no appeal lies; (b) a power of the District Judge to reier quesoions of law to the High Court; and 124 5000 1.36nute Pape r * Department. At a meeting at the 0*0* on 16th June, when we were still awaiting the views of the G-. of I., Sir G. Bashe, the G.O. Legal Adviser, deprecated the preservation of the powers of revision and reference, as being no longer suitable when the Aden Court ceases to be a subordinate court. The G. of I., whose views have now been received ■ in their telegram of 26th June, are anxious, for the reasons there given, that the powers of revision and confirmation of death sentences should be retained. The Bombay High Court, whose views are contained in the G. of I.’s later telegram of 28th June, also demur to the discontinuance of their powers of revision. It seems clear that, though the Act does not in express language state more than that the Order “shall confer appellate jurisdiction”, there is no reason why the Order should not provide for the other matters also, if this is judged expedient. It is submitted that, having regard to the views of the G. of I. and the Bombay High Court, we should press the C.O. to agree that revisional jurisdiction at any rate should be continued, aid also confirmation of death sentences (though the Bombay High Court themselves do not ask for this). A farther small noint on which we have asked for, but have not yet received, the observations of the G. of I. is whether a contribution, and if so, on what scale, should be paid by Aden towards the expenses of the Bombay High Court (see last lines of Sec. 2o8(4) of tue Act). The Bombay Govt., with the concurrence of the high Court, suggest, however, that provision should ue maae in the/ 4424 5000 1.86nute Paper. Department. the article for the recovery of the coart fees from Aden, and perhaps if provision is made for this we need not. make provision for any contribution. The other main point of Indian interest is the method of dealing with the other pledges given by H.M.G. and enumerated in para. 162 of the J.S.C.’s report. As regards these, please see the minute at flag G. The meeting at the C.O. on 16th June decided (a) that an article in the terms of Art. 21 of the revised draft should be inserted in the 0. in C. to guard against racial discrimination^ in regard to entry into Adery and holding property and carrying on business there; (b) that the pledges to maintain the policy of making Aden a free port and in regard to additional taxation should be dealt with by providing in the Royal Instructions that any ordinance imposing import or export duties, or any additional taxation, cannot be brought into operation except with the permission of the Home Govt.; and that (to give further effect to the pledge against racial discrimination) a similar provision should be made with regard to ordinances whereby non-Europeans might be subjected or made liable to disabilities or restrictions; differential (c) that the remaining pledges could not suitably be dealt with in the Order or Royal Instructions, buu that the Governor should be instructed by formal despatch bo observe them. 2) J'Vt 4424 5000 1/36' v - ■ A OPUS ;IECU1ATED) From Government of India, Foreign .and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India* repeating J * from the Government of Bombay Simla, 28th June, 1936* Dated Received 10 a*m., 28th June, 19^56 &lt; XXX 1450, o Reference our telegram of the 26th instant, 1440 c Following telegram has been received from Government of Bombay,, 89, June 2?th, and is repeated for information&lt;» Benina* 1451 o Aden Order in Council« Following is the opinion of High Court.

They connote a valuable right to iitig&amp;tirg public and often make for redress of substantial injustice. Appeal by special leave cannot altogether take the place of revision* because it is by no means clear to their Lordships that they would be able to grant special leave to appeal in all cases in which a revision application lies at present * Their Lordships ??ould therefor© press for retention of existing revisional powers of this High Court.

This Government* with the concurrence of the High Court, suggests that provision should be made in Article 20 for recovery by High Court, on matters coming from Aden, of court fees on suoh scales as may be laid down from time to time by law as ^severable on similar matters coming to the High Court from Courts in this Presidency.

E4th June, 1936. ^ / Aden . y^lie searete lias revealed that the difficulty r l^dLf K* fdnrfj PUjL. at out the Admiralty jurisdiction of the Aden Court is -a tiidgcHs-ttoot. S.2(l) of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, provides that 'every court of law in a British possession which is for the time Being declared in pur suance of this Act to he a court of Admiralty, or which if no such declaration is in force in the possession has therein original unlimited civil jurisdiction,' shall he a colonial court of Admiralty. The new Supreme Court, or whatever the Colonial Office decide to call it, will obviously have original unlimited civil jurisdiction in Aden and therefore it is not necessary to have any declaration that it is a colonial court of Admiralty at all, either in the Aden Order or anywhere else, and the references in the Slave Trade^Bast African Courts^Acts to the Vice-Admiralty Court at Aden will, hy virtue of s.2(3) of the 1890 Act, work without adaptation. I have put this■ to Roberts-Wray and he expresses himself orima facie •a* satisfied that this is so, anu. unless, therefore, further consideration reveals some difficulty oo nim - a contingency which I regard as unlikely - our trouoles seem to be over. Hevertheless the arrangement that we should attend the meeting on Tuesday morning had, I think, better stand. Even if this point does not turn up, it sounds to me as if others might.

Dear Dawson, I enclose for your information a copy of a letter which, on Hill's instructions, I have sent to Hobarts-Wray of the Colonial Office. He is the one of Bushe’s subordinates who is dealing with the matter. Yours sincerely, .r Vernon Dawson, K.C.I.E., India Office, S.W.l.22nd June, 1936. Dear Roberts-#ray, Aden. The India Office have just told us that some Order or Regulation in 1933 re-organised the courts in Aden, by implication abolished the Resident's court and made the main court a district judges court for all purposes. We have not g)t this Order or Regulation before us, and we do not therefore know exactly what the position is. So far, however, as we can tell the result of it was that there is now no Colonial Court of Admiralty in Aden. This of course means that you will have carefully to consider what jurisdiction you want your new Supreme Court to have, and whether that jurisdiction can be given to it by your Order. The point has probably got other ramifications, and Hill and I will look into it further as soon as we can and let you know of any discoveries we may make orRecord of a Meeting lield nt the Colonial Office at 11 a*BU on the 16th of June to consider the draft Aden Order in Council and the draft Royal Instructions* There were presentj- Sir Grattan Bushe Mr, Cowell Mr. Roberts-Wray Mr. Blazier Sir Herbert arson Sir Archibald Carter Sir Vernon Dawson Mr. V/alt on Mr. Clauson Sir Bernard Reilly It was decided to examine the draft Order clause by clause and consider what amendments were required and what points needed consideration* The India Office representatives enquired whether it was uronosed to Lay the draft Royal Instructions before parliament. Sir R rchibaid Carter mentioned that the instruments under the Government of India Act * 1955* had to be approved by parliament* and that this might lead some member of parliament to thinh that they ought similarly to approve the Instrument relating to Aden. Only the Aden Order in Council would need parliamentary approval but it might perhaps disarm possible crideism if the Aden draft Instructions were laid before parliament (m the Chair) * ) ) Colonial Office, ) ) ) India Office* Resident and Chief Commissioner at Aden.at the same time so that they could discuss its terms though specific approval would not he needed. sir arattan Bushe said that it was not normally the practice to lay draft Royal Instructions before parliament* hut the Colonial Office representatives agreed to consider whether* in the special circumstances of the present case* the draft Instructions should he laid. The meeting then proceeded to examine the clauses of the draft Order« Doubt was expressed whether the third recital and Clause 86 were required. Since it was now settled that the remainder of the Act other than part II as piwi&amp;ed for in Section 320 of the Government of India Act* 1935, will come into force on the same date as the Aden Order in Council, the repeal of the Government of India (Aden) Act, 1929* as provided for in Section 321 of the Government of India Act, 1935* will take effect from the same date as the establishment of the new Colony of Aden, The possibility* therefore, of the Government of India ( 'den) Act, 1929, being repealed either too early or too late no longer arose. It was decided, therefore, that, subject to the concurrence of parliamentary Counsel, the third recital and Clause 26 could be omitted. It was arranged that the Colonial Office would consult Pariiantentazy Counsel on this point® Clause 2, In connection with the definition of '’the Province”, some discussion took place in regard to the status of the Kuria Murla Islands® It was agreed that this matter should be xjursued further in correspondence between the Colonial Office and the India Office® Dalton stated that the matter was at the moment under referencereference to the Government of India* sir Bernard Reilly referred to paragraph 2 of his despatch of the 20 th May, 1936 , in which he raised the question whether, as an appeal will lie from the Courts at Aden to the High Court at Bombay, there was any objection to the use of the term n Supreme Court'’ to describe the Court of the Colony** Sir Grattan Bushe stated that it was the normal practice to describe the superior court of all Colonies by the term Supreme court'* and he did not think that this need be altered on account of the description of the Bombay High Court* It was agreed that the phrase f? supreme Court M should be used® Cla use 5 C It was agreed that the wording of this clause should be as follows s t? The appointed day shall be the first day of April, 1937, and as from that day the following provisions of this Order shall have effect”» Clause 5 0 Sir Berna rAJ^eilly referred to paragraph 2 of his despatch of the 20th May, 19*56, in which he enquired whether the term ^Governor” would be used both in respect of the Colony and of the protectorate* was agreed that this would probably be the case but that the point would have to be settled in connection with the Order in Council for the Protectorate«&gt; Clause Qo sir Bernard Reilly referred to his comments on this clause in his despatch of the 20 th May, 1936* in those comments he liaised the question whether, in the absence of the Governor, it was proposed that uhe Air Officer Commanding or the senior civil official snou3d act as Governor. under his proposal, where there is a Political secretary and a Civil Secretary, the senior membermember of the Executive Council would be the Air Officer Commanding* It was explained that normally a dormant commission was issued providing for the discharge of the office of Governor in the latter*a absence and that the provisions in Clause 8 regarding the senior member of the Executive Council were designed merely to provide for the discharge of the office of Governor in the event of the Governor himself and the holder of a dormant commission both being absent or unable to discharge their duties* This Commission could provide* if it were so desired* that the chief civil official should act as Governor* H Clause 10* In accordance with the Resident^ recommendation in his despatch of the 20th May, 1936* the Colonial Office will now consider the provision of a Public Seal for the new Colony* Clause 14* The question was raised whether, in view of the terms of Section 309 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1935* any Orders in Council made under Clause 14 would have to be laid before parliament. It was agreed that since Section 288 (2) of the Government of India '\ct, 1935, did not lay down but assumed the power of His Majesty to legislate by Order in Council for Aden, there would be no necessity for Orders in Coimcil made under Clause 14 to be laid before Parliament. Clause 15* sir Bernard Reilly stated that the title of the existing Court at Aden was n The District Court and the Court of Session”. Mr. Robertsray observed that in certain old Instruments the Aden Court was described as the Resident*s Court. Sir Herbert Pearson stated that the Resident’s * The Secretary of State has now approved the proposal that the Royal Instructions should not pi»ovide for the appointment of the Air Officer Commanding to be a member of the Executive Council.Resident^ Court had heen superseded hy the present Court as a result of GoYernment of India Regulation No e VI of 1955® In the Indian Court of Admiralty Act of 1891 the Aden Court is siDoken of as the Resident 7 s Court and it was agreed that steps would he required in order to make it clear that the new Supreme Court at Aden would he a Colonial Court of Admiralty® This could possibly he done in the Order in Oouneil which was being prepared for the purpose of adapting existing Indian Acts to the new situation? hut perhaps the preferable course would be to make the necessary provision in this Order® The India Office representatives agreed to take this point up with Parilamentary Counsel« Clause 16» It was agreed that in order to meet the Government of India’s proposal in their telegram No® 1535 of the 10th June? the beginning of this clause should be worded as follows; Subject to the provisions of this Order? all Acts, Orders? Ordinances? Regulations and other enactments having the force of law in the Province immediately before the appointed day shall • • • ® • * The other modifications proposed by the Government ox India in paragraph 2 of their telegram would then be unnecessary. It was pointed out that certain further action in addition to the of this clause would oe required in order fully to cover the new position® under existing legislation the Governor General of India has certain powers in respect of Aden® There are for example certain powers now reserved to the Government of India m respect of the Aden Port Trust and under certain Acts and Regulations in which the powers of the Chief Commissioner areare now limited. It will 'be necessary to decide in due course who is to exercise these powers after the appointed day. Certain of the powers will no douht he vested in the new Governor, hut it may he desirable in other cases for the power to lie with the secretary of state for the Colonies, It was generally agreed that it will he necessary to prepare an Aden Ordinance under which existing Indian legislation applicable to Aden will he adapted to suit the new situation. Such an Ordinance would have to he enacted by the Governor immediately the new constitution comes into force. Clause 19, An Ordinance will he required prescribing the procedure for proceedings against the Government, Precedents will he supplied by the Colonial Office, This Ordinance also should he enacted as soon as possible after the appointed day. Clause 20, With regard to the questions discussed in Sir Bernard Reilly T s despatch of the 20th May, Sir Grattan Bushe deprecated the preservation of powers of reference or revision at present vested in the High Court of Bombay which are suitable only so long as the Aden Court is a subordinate Court, which, after the appointed day, it will not be* The present provisions governing appeals, reference and revision are in Regulation VI of 1933 sections 6 , 7 , 8 , 36, 57 and 38, It was thought that in any event, in order to avoid any uncertainty the best course would be for Clause 20 to repeal these sections and reproduce so much of them as is desired to preserve. Sir Grattan Bushe proposeu that in lieu of the provision for revision in civil cases, uh© High[r? High Court of Bombay should he empowered when there is no appeal as of right to grant leave to appeal in special cases, the words of Clause 20(2)(h) being adapted for this purpose and that section 37 of the regulation, which provides for confirmation of death sentences should he omitted* since the India Office stated that they are awaiting the comments of the Government of India on the questions involved. of India in their telegram of the 10th June regarding a contribution by Aden to the expenses of the Bombay High Court, It was agreed that, in view of the wording of Section 288 of the Government of India Act, 1935, it will be necessary for any provision for this to be included in the Order in Council. It was pointed out that in all cases heard before the High Court in Bombay the fees payable would be taken by the High Court and that therefor an equitable contribution towards the expenses of the Court would probably be very small* This being so, the general feeling was that it might be unnecessary to make provision for a small payment of this nature, but the India Office representatives agreed to ask the Government of India whether they desired a contribution to be made* If so, they would be asked to suggest a figure and to supnly statistics. Sir Bernard Reilly's despatch of the 20th May, 1936, that the sum of Rs* 10,000 should be substituted for £500 in Clause 30{S)(a), and that the words 'and /5here7* if the Ho final decision on this clause was reached With reference to the enquiry of the Goverameu It was agreed to adopt the proposals made in final &amp; For clarity the word 'where** should be omittedfinal judgment appealed from affirms the decision of the Supreme Court the appeal involves some substantial question of law* 1 should he added to Clause 22(2)(a). Clause 22. The words '’and Ministers 1 * should he omitted. Clause 23. The India Office representatives enquired whether it was proposed that as from the apnointed day the disciplinary code applicable to Colonial officials should he applied to all Government officials serving at Aden, whether Colonial officials or Indian officials who were retained. It was pointed out that Indian officials who continued in the service of the new Aden Administration would only remain if they wished to do so and that it would he most difficult for the new Colonial Government to apply any other rules than those applicable under Colonial Regulations. It was agreed that this was the only feasible arrangement. Clause 24. The India Office representatives raised the question whether this clause covered commutation of sentences. Sir Grattan Bushe pointed out that* as a commutation is in form a conditional pardon, the answer is in the affirmative. He also expressed the view with reference to Bection 337 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code, which has no parallel in the Colonies at present^ that the proper authority to grant a pardon was the Governor and not a Court. It was agreed that there Is no conflict between Clause 24 and the section in question and that the former should stand as drafted. The section if retained will presumably require adaptation xn the Ordinance referred to above in the comments on Clause 10. Sir Bernard Reilly was informed, with reference to his comment on Clause 21 of the Royal instructions, ^ itit was proposed to substitute rt a meeting of the Executive Council* for the words **the first meeting of the Executive Council which may he conveniently held thereafter*, This would enable the Governor to await the result of an appeal or not as he thought fit* The meeting then considered the pledges which have been given by His Majesty*s Government in respect of the fixture administration of Aden and discussed whether any provisions to cover any of these pledges could be suitably included in the Order in Council or Royal Instructions* The pledges are as follows (1) India would be relieved of the annual contribution ©f approximately £150,000 sterling or Esu 20 lakhs at present payable towards the military and political administration* and no part of this' sum would be chargeable to the revenues of the Colony of Aden* (2) The right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court would be maintained® (3) His Majesty ? s Government would maintain the existing policy of making Aden a free port unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place* Prom their own point of view abandonment of this policy would clearly* in existing economic conditions* be financially unsound since the prosperity of iden depends largely on Its transit trade. (4) His Majesty's Government would do their utmost to maintain the present standard of administration and would not impose any additional taxation unless such a course became in their opinion absolutely necessary* (5) a proportion of Indian Service Administrative personnel would be retained in the Aden service for some years after the transfer took place* ( 6 ) No racial legislation or segregation would De permitted by His Majesty's Government* (?) Indians should be allowed free entry into &lt;-ne x^den Protectorate. It was agreed that the best method of dealing with certain of the pledges would be for the Secretary of StateState for the Colonies to address a formal despatch to the n8W Governor setting out these pledges and instructing him to observe them. It was agreed that Item. 1 was a matter of administrative arrangement and that no reference to it would he required either in the formal instruments or in the proposed despatch© Ho. 2 wae already dealt with in the order in Council. It was thought that Ho. 3 and the t ,..cond pa.t of Ho. 4 could he satisfactorily dealt with hy amending Clause 16(6) of the Royal Instructions to read as follows • »Any ordinance imposing import or export duties or any additional taxation”.

Sir B. Reilly n will be present. Most of the draft Order and Instructions is matter for the C.O. Apart from the necessity of ensuring that the provisions fit in with those of the Act and the Commencement and Transitory Provisions Order, we are principally concerned with the following matters of substance:- (1) Art. 16 of the draft Order - Continuance of existing laws. The 0* of I. in their telegram of 10th June have suggested a redraft of this. Sir m Reilly s telegram of 23rd May suggested a schedule of all existing Indian laws and Regulations now applicable to Aden. It seems best not to attach such a scheoule t/O the Oraer on account of the danger of omission in any attempt to enumerate. I understand from Sir B. Reilly, who called to-day, that he did not mean to suggest that a schedule should necessarily be attached to the Order, but that it would be desirable some time to draw up a list, so that the authorities at Aden would know where they stand; j&gt; this, of coarse, could be done subsequently cy Sir B. Reilly's own legal adviser at Aden. All ^hat we are concerned with seems to be to put in the Order a comprehensive expression which will undoubtedly cove- all existing laws, and the G. of I.'s draft seems lOm facie. adequate for this purpose. (2) Art. 20 of d raft Order - Appeals, etc., to the/ A,. 1;inute Paper. Department. 45/35. 3436b 5000 1.35 the Bombay High Coart. We have not yet got the G. of I.’s observations on this, as they are consulting the Govt, of Bombay, but they raise in their telegram the question of 'such contribution, if any, as H.M. in C. may determine shall be paid out of the revenues of Aden towards the expenses” of the Bombay High Court (Sec. 288(4) of the new net). (3) The question to what extent, and how, the Royal Instructions should cover H.M.G.’s “pledges” enumerated at the end of para. 162 of the Joint Select Committee’s Report. As regards the “pledges” (a) to maintain the existing policy of making Aden a free port, and (b) go impose no additional taxation unless in h.L.G. s opinion such a course is absolutely necessary, Sir 3. lie ill j/ has suggested, in a despatch of 20th May, that any ordinance imposing customs duties or altering the existing scales or methods of taxation should be added^ to the classes of ordinance (in Sec. 16 of the draft Instructions) which cannot be brought into operation except with the permission of the Home Govt. In this connection the classes of ordinance enumerated under (6) and (9) in Sec. 16 oi the urait Instructions should also be noted. As regards the “pledge” (c) that no racial discrimination shall be permittee, please see tfo of the classes of ordinance enumerated under oec. 16 of the draft Instructions. In a letter of Vth December, 1933, the C.O. amplified this “pledge” with an assurance “that in the event of transfer there will be no racial discrimination, either in legislation or—in q rlrwi v-i n r*£)+, i mn /Minute Paper. Department. P.Z. 7493/33. &lt;UU h~ j J &gt; nttk. 5000 1.86 adninistration against Indian British subjects in Aden”. We asked for this assurance because in Kenya and elsewhere differentiation against Indians has occurred in practice without any discrimination in the law itself. Such administrative differentiation is not likely to occur in Aden, tat we obtained this assurance m deference to a suggestion made by the G. of 1. (originating with Sir B. fitter). There is also a 'pledge” (d) that British Indian subjects should be allowed to enter the Protectorate under precisely the same conditions as any &lt; — other British subjects. There are, I understand, restrictions on the entry of all British subjects frorr, Aden into the Aden Protectorate. The 'pledge' (e) that a proportion of Indian service personnel shall be retained for some years after the date of transfer is to be interpreted in the manner described at A in para. 12 of the memo, for the J-S-C. of 20th November, 1933'(page 17 of the paper flagged^, the file). There is also a 'pledge' (f) that B.N.G. would do leir utmost to keep the administration at its present t/ Q « I should think that 'pledges' (e) and (f) above ould more suitably be made the subject of specific nstructions embodied in despatches to the uovemor ather than be included in the Royal Instructions, he 'pledges' against administrative (as well as egislative) discrimination and m regard to entry into ,he protectorate might perhaps be included in ' ' J natructions. The 0. of I. s«e,t that eU against/inute Paper- Department against discrimination should be included in the Order itself, but I-should think there might be difficulty about this in regard to administrative discrimination. The meeting will be attended by Sir H. Pearson, Sir V. Dawson^ Sir A. Carter and^liQ bnrl] nv rrf nry ■ \itirrrr~ as well as departmental representatives. /r. 6. %i&gt;CWP/LJC/DIA FILE COP' /.J a 19 9 i / / D E C Y P H E R Prom (182 grxupo) OF T E L E G R A M&lt; ^45, SECRET CjO. 27790 ' (copies x circulated) Government of India* Foreign and.

T^rew Laws and Enactments # It has been agreed that all existing Indian Laws and Enactments ? including the Indian Civil and Criminal Procedure Codes, and procedure should remain in force. This will presumably be effected by means of an Order in Council as in the case of British Somaliland when it was separated from Indian control. Mth regard to new Laws, it has been proposed that the Governor should be given power, with the consent of the Crown, to enact them, the concurrent power of the Crown to legislate by Order in Council being retained. There will be an Executive Council, of which I suggest that the following should be ex-officio members s- The Governor. The Air Officer Commanding. The Political Secretary. The Civil Secretary. The Chaiman of the Aden Port Trust and Settlement. The Treasurer. If non-official members are appointed they should be representative of the different communities in Aden, and they would therefore probably have to be not less than five in number, which would allow for one European, one Indian, two Arabs (as representing the largest community) and one Jew. I do not suggest that this racial allocation should be laid down by regulation, but it would probably be followed in practice by the Governor in making his recemendations. lf it is not considered advisable to add these non-official members to the Executive Council at present, they might be made members of an Advisory Council, which would also include the members of the Executive Council, and i would be summoned at the Governor-s discretion only to discuss matters on which he wished to obtain direct contact with local public opinion. With regard to the drafting of new Laws or been proposed that the Governor should ask Enactments, it hasfor the advice of the Colonial Office on drafts prepared with the assistance of the Judicial Assistant at Aden 5 and that in cases of real urgency or emergency he would have to do the best he could leaving any errors to he remedied later* In this connection I may mention that the designation of Judicial Assistant has been changed in 1933 to District and Sessions Judge, but he still acts in an advisory capacity in legal matters to the Resident and Chief Commissioner, and it should be made clear in the t erms of future appointments that he is to continue to exercise this function for the Governor in addition to his judicial duties. I suggest that 'Legal Adviser” be aided to the present official designation of this Officer.' l—&gt; O \.\. isi. t K O '1 t-\. L b.'l ^ v3 ^ V V w 1 9th June, 1936.

Sir j have the honour to refer to your Confidential despatch dated 16th April 1936 enclosing copies of drafts of the Order in Council to be issued under Section 28S of the Government of India Act 1935 and of the Royal Instructions to be issued tc the Governor of the Colony of Aden, together with a copy of the Government of India Act 1935 and of a letter addressed to the Government of India by the India Office? and instructing me to furnisn . my observations upon these drafts* 2* The observations which I desire to offer are the following; '* Aden Ord er _in_Coi:ncil-1956 Sections 2(1) and 15 refer to the Supreme Court of the Colony. As an appeal will lie from this Court to the High Court of Bombay? it is possible that uie term ”Supreme Court 1 ’ may be open to objcot.?.on 0 I- I suggest that the term ’’Principal Court” night oc subs tituted. Section 5 provides for the appointment oj. e. Governor and Commander-in-chief in and over t)ie Col cry • This designation will supersede the present designation of Chief Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. yilA - l also Ide Right Honourable J.H. Thomas? P*C.&gt; ?Ihit ? Secretary of State for the Colonxes? London.also supersede the present designation of Resident, which is held in respect of the Aden Protectorate? This point is not one to be dealt with directly in the Order in Council, which refers to the Colony of Aden as distinct from the Protectorate, but it is a point arising as a result of the Order in Council, and I therefore submit it for decision. I suggest that, if possible, the term 'Governor' should be comprehensive, covering both the Colony and the Protectorate. Section 8 provides that in certain circumstances the senior member of the Executive Council should administer the Government of the Colony. The senior member of tne Executive Council will probably be the Air Officer Commanding the Forces in Aden, who so far has never acted for the Chief Commissioner. The present practice in ems respect is that the Political Secretary acts for the Resident and Chief Commissioner when the latter is abseno, and I assume that it is intended to continue this arrange^ ment unless a post of Chief Secretary is created.^ or unless it happens that the Civil Secretary is senior to ohe Political Secretary. As long as there are two Secretaries (Political and Civil) and no Chief Secretary? I consAe.er that the senior of them should act for the Governor in 'he latter’s absence, although neither of them is the senior member of the Executive Council® existing two Secretaryships are merged into a Secretaryshipj, then the Chief Secretary would person to act® Sections9 and 10 refer to the public Colony. The question of designing and providing a Public Seal will no doubt be dealt with by the Colonial ofii'-e. Section 15* likely to be If the Chief be the proper Seal of the2.S7 Section 15. I n the second paragraph of this section the designation of the. existing Court at Aden has -oeen left Dial*. The proper designation of this Court is 'District Court and the Court of Session' 11 . Q^tion 20(1) and provide for appeals to the High Court of Bombay in accordance with Section 288(4) of the Government of India Act, l&amp;Co. At present the right of appeal is regulated by the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Regulation (VI of 1935), which provioec for appeal in certain cases as of right only, ou^ ■provides for revisional powers of the Bombay High Gourw, for references to the Bombay High Court, and for the confirmation of death sentences by the High Court. Unacr the Order in Council, as drafted, these powers of revision, reference, and confirmation of death sentences will lapse; and the High Court may construe the word 'appeal' in the Order as 'appeal as of right'. X have consulted the District and Sessions Judge, who is of opinion thau the retention of powers of revision by Xhe High Court i»j desirable, if this can be arranged within the terms of Section 288(4) of the Government of India Act, provides for appeals only. He suggests that/ done by a proviso to Section 20(1) reserving to the H.»g Court of Bombay a right to admit by special leave an appeal upon such conditions as it may deem fit to impose In ca in which it appears that the supreme wouxt in (a) has exercised jurisdiction not vested 1* (b) has failed to exercise jurisdiction so veot^d (c) has acted in the exercise of illegally or with material irregu-i -. In order to secure that the Governor shall not have P°wex to withdraw this x*lght to admit appeals by opeeial andand * in order to make it clear that the Governor has power under the Order to create ’’appeal at the discretion of the Supreme Court” he further advises that the wording of Section 2G(4)(a)(i) should he altered to read as follows:- n© limit or define the judgments from which appeals Tnev he brought as of right # or at the discretion Cu. the Supreme Court, and for this purpose to amend or repeal any law in force at the appointed do.y * j n section 2Q(2)(a) the District and Sessions judge recommends that Rsao.DOO he substituted for £500 sterling* The former sum is the qualification at present prescribed, and, as it was decided on at a time when tne purchasing pov/er of money was greater than now, he eonsiaer* that it ought hot to be reduced. Further, in order to bring Aden appeals from &gt;- • High Court of Bombay to the Privy Council into line \ri 1-1 •. other appeals from the High Court, the District and Sessions Judge suggests that the last provision of Section HO of Civil Procedure Code be added to Sec cion P0( s) (c*), follows:~ ”, and where, if the final judgment appv.a.U.- ft°'- affirms the decision of the Supreme Couru, n appeal involves some substantial q 32 .es cion o.

My comments on Aden Order-in« Council were despatched to Colonial Office on May 20th, and will be sent to Government of India by mail leaving Aden on May 24th,, Regarding Article 16 of Order-IruCouncil, I consider that it will be necessary to amplify the precise meaning by drawing up a schedule of all existing Indian laws and regulations now applicable to Aden. Secondly, X have already suggested additions to Section 16 of Instructions to the Governor to safeguard pledges regarding freedom of the ion. I agree that specific instructions to the vernor regarding all pledges given by His Majesty*e Government are desirable. 2 3 MAY 1936 INU•aft Paper. tf’Z-JtlJy, , Department. 5000 12.35 22 MAY 193a is s. w. i- Would you kindly refer to your despatch to Aden of the 16th April, No. 78110/36, and connected correspondence about the draft Aden Order in r and royal instructions. to the Government of India ask their comments may be expected deals v/ith two points which ha raised here during our prelimi mination of the draft Order I spoke to you on the t ut the second point - i.e. by which H.M.G.*s pledges as g para.162 of the Joint Select C Report can be brought to the specific notice of the Governor. V/e take it that the Colonial Office would agree in principle that this is desiraole, and the question really is one only of the means by which this—ea^i be done. I y agree you will no doubt look i ntp this matter befor-^-we- have our meet-aLag^ a oepy of a telegram which we I now enclose,—for your- f- ^ r /J P- 'Hn *' ! ' M. J. CLAUSONdiur Sir V.Dawson , I take it from your note that you would not suggest formulating at this stage any actual amendment, e.g. of Article 16 of the draft Order in Council^ which could Toe sent 'by air mail to the Government of India as foreshadowed in the last sentence of the first paragraph of Mr.Rumbold’s letter of the 9th April, P.Z.2424/36. If this is right the programme appears to be: (a) wait for the Government of India and 3ir B. Reilly’s comments; s (b) conference with Colonial Office draftsmen, etc. (c) final approval of draft Order and submission to Parliament. The question seems to be how long we should w-ht /\ for the Government of India’s comments. I have an idea wkf ^ . that you want to have this draft^ m its final form wit, m the next month or so. If so, Mr.Rumbold’s letter o^. April Sth was not perhaps coached in sufficiently urgent terms and it may be worth sending an express letter or telegram to the Government of India giving them a time limit, ho you agree and if so what time limit would you suggest ? It might be a good thing to send copies of the Legal Adviser’s and your notes to the Colonial Office forthwith, Do you agree ? The Government of India have promised to let us hav all proposals forjJrders in Councillor wh^h they are responsible (and^presumably/all comments on draits v/hici we have sent them) not later than the end of May. I agree, however, that it would be as well to ascertain by telegram when thmr comments on this draft are uo be expect 1/N A 2 . I see no harm in deferring the conference between ourselves, the Colonial Office draftsman and the . . parliamentary Counsel until atiout 8th June li^it the Government of India's comnents. Meanwhile, I do not suggest sending any amendment of paragraph id of the draft Order to the Government of India, but suggest that they should certainly be consulted about the question of dealing with the 'pledges'. I should deprecate a copy of my note being sent to the Colonial Office. It would have to be re-written for the purpose. I assume that it is desired that this Order should be made before, and have effect from, the date of the commencement of Part III, and suggest, therefore, that it would apparently be desirable to get it through with the others before the beginning of the summer recess, i.e. to have it laid not later than about the end of June. We are under pledge to the Government of India not to lay any Order without their having been consulted about the text in all respects in advance. Presumably they will wish to publish this draft Order, as they have done in the case of all the others, in India at the same time as it is presented to Parliament.(&amp; ■ Minute Paper. Department. A. 2 . -t. / 'Z~2&gt;o ^ J&gt;) oJ^/lZ-*. .^&lt;-2 &lt;^^{^*-£0 3 ^. ^ * ■ti I take it that we are not very directly concerned with the form of government proposed to he set up by this draft Order in Council in Aden and by the accompanying Instructions, nor indeed with the method by which the intended results are to be brought about. These appear to be matters primarily for the Colonial Office. Some of the provisions of the Order seem from our standpoint unusual and also, in some respects, the distribution of matter between the Order and the Instructions, e.g. the provision in the Order that there shall be an Executive Council and the absence from the Order of any provision as to what function this Council is to perform; this is to be found in the instructions. But no doubt both the matter and the ! manner are more or less in common Colonial Office form. It is, however, our business, I presume, to assist the | colonial Office so far as we ctn to ensure that the provisions of the Order will be such as to make the position in Aden legally watertight from the appointed day. I agree with the Legal Adviser in feeling some doubt whether paragraph 16 of the draft Order is really a sufficient clearing up of the position as to the law to be m force • + h The law in force in Aden at the from the appointed day. in e w\ T* / 4424 5000 1/36„„,„t 1=, I si-. “■« d ' 1,e ' 1 fr °' (i ) Regulations under s.71 of the existing Government of India Act, or (ii) Acts of the Indian Legislature in force in Aden, and (presumably) (iii) Acts of the Bombay Legislative Council in force in Aden. It may be that the provision at the end of paragraph 16 will be good enough to ensure that all powers exercisablA by the Governor-General in Council in relation to Aden and ? by the Bombay Government, shall henceforth be exercisable by the Governor of Aden. But I am inclined to doubt, as I gather does also the Legal Adviser, whether, in fact, this provision is good enough for the purpose. What is to be the position of an Act of the Indian Legislature (and ? of the Bombay Legislative Council) applying at the moment to Aden which is next year repealed or amended by the Legislature? Will the Act, in virtue of paragraph 16, in its application to Aden stand unrepealed or unamended? I presume that this is the intention, and that after the appointed day the only authority which can amend or repeal law in force in Aden in virtue of paragraph 16 will be either the Governor or the King in Council. I am not sure how paragraph 26 of the draft Order will fit in with our draft Commencement and Transitory Provisions Order. I suggest that it would he as well as soon as we have received the Government of India's comments to have a conference between the Colonial Office draftsman and other Colonial Office representatives and ourselves, including one or both of the Parliamentary Counsel who are responsible for the other Orders under the Act, to ensure that there is no conflict on points of this kind. The pledges contained in paragraph 162 of the Joint Committee's Report were:- G» (2 ^ 4 if A} m/Department. (i) Preservation of a right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court. (ii) Maintenance of the existing policy of making Aden a (iii) Maintenance of the administration at its present standard. (iv) Maintenance of the position of no additional taxation unless such a course is absolutely necessary. (v) Retention of a proportion of Indian Service personnel for some years after the date of transfer. (vi) No racial discrimination. (vii) British India subjects to be allowed to enter the Protectorate under the same conditions as any other British subjects. Clearly no provision could appropriately be made in the Order for any of these matters, except the first, for which provision is made in paragraph 20(l) and (3). But I agree that it certainly ought to be considered, in consultation with the Colonial Office, whether provision ought not to be made in the Instructions for some or all free port. of the remainder.B MDcXED 12b' Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and ^following number quoted ~7 fUtO I 4,^ y. ^ fu Reference to previous correspondence: ^ a, O Fetter the Colonial Office of the 7 “ f rW C */o H L..

We are putting in hand the preparation of a draft Order in Council under section 288 of the Government of India Act, providing for the administration of Aden as a Colony by a Governor and Commander m Chief, with the necessary subsidiary instruments (Royal Instructions etc.). When the draft is in shape it will be desirable to have a conference with your Legal Adviser, and indeed there are certain provisions of the Order which I think we shall have to ask him to draft - see for example sub-section (3) (c) and (d) of Section 288 of the Act. I do not think it will be necessary to discuss the terms of the draft personally with Reilly,and it will enough to send him the final draft for any comments. It will be time enough for him to come home m June for the discussion of the administrative details of the transfer. ESQ., O.b. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) H.R. Cowell=====,COPYOF 9137/35. THi: SE3IDKNCY, Aden, 26th Hoveniber, 1936. My dear Walton, Thank ynu very much for your letter of 5th November 1935 about the extension of my tenure of the appointment of Chief Commissioner at Aden until such time as the transfer to the Colonial Office takes place* I am very grateful to you and to the Government of India for making this arrangement, which will give me the opportunity of continuing ray service at Aden over a time of special interest to the place. I am also grateful to the Colonial Office for their proposal to appoint me as the first Governor after the transfer, and I hope that this retention of an Indian Service Officer may help to make the transition as smooth as possible anu to reassure those among the local people who are apprehensive about the consequences of the change. I see that you said in your letter of 29th August to Acheson that you understood that the Colonial Office/Office contemplate consideration of details of the change* perhaps by a small Committee, tfhen I am at home next summer* I do not know whether the India Office and the Colonial Office have as yet any particular time in the summer in mind for the meeting of a Committee for this puipose. I am provisionally proposing to go home about the middle of June, but ea» tell me when it will be most convenient for this matter to be dealt with, it will help me in arranging ;iy leave and in booking my passage* which I ought Boon to do, as the homeward ships are very crowded in the spring and early summer* Yours sincerely, ( 8 &amp;) B.R* REILLY*RE 52 i o 1 / i- j The War Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. 7th January, 1936. Dear Cowell, We are shortly asking Parliamentary Counsel to draft the Army and Air Force (Animal) Bill for 1936. This Bill (which has to receive Royal Assent hy 30th April) should contain all the amendments which are to come into operation Before the passing of the 1937 Bill. Unless the Annual Act expressly provides to the contrary, the amendments to the Army Act come into force on 30th April at Home, and on 31st July abroad. Is it possible for you to say now what exactly is to happen under Section 288 of the Government of India Act with regard to the government of Aden, and when the change will take place? Donaldson (India Office) in his letter to me of 23rd December (a copy of which he sent to you) suggests that Aden will be a colony under a governor. If this 18 so, it seems that Section ISTO of the Army Act will either require amendment or have to oe repealed, in the event Aden would then automatically fall within definition of 'colony' in Section 190 (23A).

The Colonial Ofxice be consulted on the drafting of the Order in Council under Section 288 of the Government of India Act, 1935, ani they will no doubt consider such matters as the inclusion, in the Order of Council of a provision vesting the military government in the Governor or ’Governor and Commander-m- Chief and in consultation with you and the Air Ministry, Gordon, Kaq*, War Office, e i &gt; • X •ft 37/56 3^ IK'D A O ^IGK, WH'T.ITA.. .» a*v,*i* S4th December, 1935* fill you please refer to the copper* ondence regarding the extension of He illy 1 a tenure at Aden ending with the Government of India’s demi-official letter of 2nd October, of which a copy was sent to you under our ( Ho. . .3.7531/G5?

I am also grateful to the Colonial Office for their proposal to appoint me as the first Governor after the transfer, and I hope that this retention of an Indian Service Officer may help to make the transition as smooth as possible and to reassure those among the local people who are apprehensive about the cons evidences of the change* I see that you said in your letter of 29th August to Acheson that you understood that the Colonial Office/Office contemplate consideration of details of the change, perhaps hy a small Committee, when I am at home next sumaer. I do not know whether the India Office and the Colonial Office have as yet any particular time in the summer in mind for the meeting of a Committee for this purpose. I am provisionally proposing to go home about the middle of June, hut if you can tell me when it will he moat convenient for this matter to he dealt with, it will help me in arranging my leave and in hooking my passage, which I ought soon to do, as the homeward ships are very crowded in the spring and early summer.

Ply dear Dunnett, With reference to the Statement enclosed with Rhodes's letter dated 23rd September, No.F.14/35-G(A), I think it would be as well to get agreement between us as to those matters in the Statement in connexion with which the Government of India may expect the initiative in the necessary action to be taken from here. I should explain at the outset that I do not propose to deal in this letter with anything contained in the Statement which concerns matters affecting the States and the Crown 1 s Representative: but with regard to the matters in the Statement mentioned under ss.3(l)(b), 3(2), 145-148 inclusive, 172 (so far as lands and buildings for the Crown 1 s Ropre s ent at ive ar e c one erne d), 2872 47 and 84(l)(d), we are assuming that the Foreign and Political Department will deal with them in correspondence with our Political (Internal) Department, will arrange separately which of them is to be initiated here and which in India, and will keep you informed of their progress. i .* 4- /-N-vin VI/-a. included in the list - no doubt because they do nou, an the first instance at all events, involve any action sg the Government of India and it is obvious that tu^ initiative in these matters must, and will be, taken i-u the India Office.

There are also in draft Instruments of Instructions to the Governors, and Indo-Burma Trade Agreements and monetary arrangements. When the time comes finally to revise these drafts, this will he done in consultation, of course, with the Government of India, hut initiated here. In this connexion, with reference to the remarks in the Statement against s.13, we agree that a separate Instrument of Instructions will he required for the Governor—General during the transitional period and shall initiate here in due course proposals, and consuj.t the Government of India upon them, as to what its contents should he. We have also in draft, and shall probably he consulting the Government of India upon it shortly , an Order in Council under s.273 relating to Commissioner^ for the Family Pension Funds. 4. Apart from the matters indicated in the preceding paragraph, which may he described o,s be.mg actually in hand, and apart further from Am mautmu • n Tr p pi q 1 u i clij G d- enumerated in paragraph 2 as necessarily ~ here, we intend to initiate from here the action or further action required in respect of the follow! mat te rs (i) s .288 .

As regards the Orders in Council under ss.l38(l) and (2), 140(2) and 142, these depend on the recommendations of the Niemeyer enquiry. The decision on them will have to be taken here; and whether it will be more convenient for the Orders to be first drafted here or in India depends in part both on the nature of the proposals and on their date in relation to the timetable. Perhaps the question, in these cases, had better remain open for the present. 5. May we therefore assume that the Government of India will forward in due course, and in due time to ensure that the necessary action can be taken, or approval given, by the requisite date in each case, their proposals on all the matters enumerated in your Statement other than those indicated in paragraphs 2-4 above? There has been correspondence between the Secretary of State and the Government of India (Home Department) on various points connected with the Services provisions, including action under s.275, but the position remains that we are awaiting proposals on those provisions from the Government of India. I should be glad if you could let me know as soon as possible whether you agree. You will, of course, realise that occasions may arise when we may find it desirable, with regard to matters which on this scheme we are expecting the Government of India to initiate, to write or telegraph suggesting that, in framing their proposals, they should take a certain line or should take certain matters into consideration. But requests of this kind need not be regarded as affecting the classification5. between initiative here and initiative in India sugge st cd in th i s 1 c11c r • 6. It now seems improbable that, in the House of Commons at all events, there will be more than, if as much as, two weeks of Parliamentary time available between the disposal of the debate on the Address and the Christmas ad&lt;journment. Consequently it is doubtful .whether we shall be able to do more before Christmas than secure the passage of the Reprinting Bill and possibly approval of the Sind and Orissa Orders; indeed it seems likely that these Orders may not be disposed of in both Houses before Christmas. If the date for the commencement of Part III is fixed as 1st April, 1937, it may be possible to leave over for disposal between October, 1936, and March, 1937, some of the matters which require the approval of Parliament. But it will clearly not be safe to have a large residue still not approved at the commencement of the summer recess 1936, and we are assuming that we shall have to aim at getting through as much as possible of the business which requires the approval of Parliament by the end of July, 1936.

One only of those assurances, viz. that appellate jurisdiction from Courts in Aden shall be conferred on a Court in India, has been embodied in the Bill ^ H • • . i (clause SW). The remaining matters (e.g. the maintenance of Aden as a free port; the keeping of the administration at its present standard, the imposing of no additional taxation unless in the oninion of H.M.G, it is aosolutely * necessary;/m -*— necessary; the allowing of British Indian subjects to enter the Protectorate under precisely the same conditions as any other British subjects; the retention of a portion of Indian Service personnel for some years after transfer (and possibly the assurance that there shall be no racial discrimination)) are not really appropriate for embodiment in an Act, or even in an order-in-council under an Act, and are really matters for executive disposal when the time comes. 2. Representations have been received from the Indian Salt manufacturers at Aden, the main request in which is for the retention in the Indian tariff of a preference for Aden salt after transfer. This request has already been discussed with Mr. H.A. LaiJjee, who is the principal Salt manufacturer, and he has been informed that it is not proposed to accede to this request (flag I). The Indian Import duty on Salt will, in fact, probably be removed next year, in which case separation would not have the result of placing Aden salt in a more disadvantageous position, although we cannot, of course, make any statement on this point at the present moment. 3 A representation has also been receiveo. from the Imperial Indian Citizenship Association, asking that the Government of India Bill should contain provisions implementing the assurances of H.M.G. quoted in paragraph 1 above.

(In a way this subclause seems to be redundant, in view of the provision made in Clause 287, but I suppose that it is desirable in Clause 94 to make this reference to the existing Chief Commissioner’s province of Aden.) Under Clause 471, Pt. IV would come into force simultaneously with Pt. III. The establishment of provincial autonomy may be found ^ ^ to be the most convenient date for separating Aden, but ^ ^ ^ it is possible that it might be desired to separate it { / * ^ either at a later or (more probably) an earlier date. i This contingency seems to be provided for by Subclause (3) i ?

Dear Walton, We have been examining clause 287 (the Aden clause) of the Government of India Bill in the latest edition of the Bill which we have, viz. as introduced in the House of Lords. A number of changes have been made, and Blaxter has had some conversation with you regarding two of these. We have no objections to raise to the clause as now drafted, but we assume that the India Office will let us know if it is proposed to make, in the House of Lords, any further changes in this clause or any other affecting Aden, in case we wish to make any comments. Yours sincerely, DALTON, ESQ. , G.B. , M. C.'2- 2- ? 8r&amp; ! 2 s Reforms Sec:,, . , The Colonial Office- telephoned to remark that Clause 287 of the Bill differs from the Aden clause as agreed with them (at flag X on this file), in that it provides that the 0. in C. w shall confer appellate jurisdiction from courts in Aden” upon a court in India, whereas the effect of the original draft was to make this permissive, though if such jurisdiction was conferred, it was to be mandatory on the court in India to exercise it. I understand that the C.O. do not wish to dissent from the new form of the provision, but they would like to know, if possible, the reason why the change was made. Is there anything that I can tell them? I should imagine that it is merely a byproduct of a draft ing improvement in Subclause 4 of the clause. There is not really a change of substance, since there has always, in any case, been the definite intention that the appellate jurisdiction should be conferred by the Order in Council on the Bombay High Court.

I submit that the very reasons which have urged the Government to take this step of separating Aden from British India are reasons for accepting this Amendment. It is obviously desirable, once the decision has been taken, that it should be put into effect as soon as possible. The only reason why we have not proposed to insert words to the effect that it should come into force on the day on which this Bill becomes an Act is because we take into account the ad ministrative difficulties, but if the Government consider that the proposed date is too early, perhaps they will sug gest some alternative date, possibly 1st April next year. Clearly it ig desitable that some date should be specified and that steps should be taken to see that this policy is translated into action and no allowed to remain as a mere pious aspiration. I suggest that there would be some danger in that course. I do not know what is the policy of the Socialist party in this respect, but it is just con ceivable that they might form a Govern ment before this Order-in-Council is passed and the Socialist party can, I think, usually be trusted to take an anti imperial line. I suggest respectfully, therefore, that there is every reason to secure that this separation should take place by a given date. - 4.40 p.m. hon^-p 8 -' ! 1 0ARE: 1 cannot follow my ' rien d into the remote and obscure hap U pen 0 of? r ° PheSy ^ may or ma y not happen after some problematic Election Let me, however, assure him that h ?! our mtention, and I believe^ is an in- ention shared by the hon.

My dear Walton, We have recently had a visit from Mr. Lalljee, one of the leading Aden salt manufacturers, who wished to discuss the position of the Aden salt trade when the Aden Settlement is transferred to the Colonial Office. He came to see Clauson at Turners suggestion. Mr. Lalljee pointed out that the Aden salt manufacturers supply half the needs of India in respect of salt and that they exported to India 275,000 tons of salt annually. They pay to the Aden Settlement a royalty on every ton of salt exported, and considerable rents for the lands which they occupy: and it is due to the existence of their industry that the port of Aden is provided with sufficient lighterage and skilled labour to handle cheaply and expeditiously the remainder of the I.C. Walton, Esq.., C.B., M.C.traffic passing through the port. There is at present charged on all salt consumed in India a duty of 1 rupee 9 annas per maund. In the case of internally produced salt this is an excise duty, and in the case of imported salt there is an import duty equal to the excise duty. Mr. Lalljee has apparently no complaint regarding this charge, which will presumably continue in the future as it supplies 5 per cent, of the Government of India’s revenue, hut he pointed out that there is at present an Additional Import Duty on salt imported into India. Salt produced at Aden, which is at present part of India, does not pay this additional import duty. Mr. Lalljee fears that, when the transfer takes place, this preferential treatment for Aden salt will cease, or possibly that the Additional Import Duty might be abolished. In either event he anticipates that, owing to considerable foreign competition from, for example, neighbouring salt works in Italian Somaliland and Eritrea, notably at Assab and Ras Hafun, which might he conducted on wholly uneconomic lines in order to divert shipping business from Aden to these ports, the Aden salt industry will be ruined. If this happened.the Aden Settlement would lose tlie large revenue which it at present obtains both directly and indirectly from the salt industry, the whole economy of the Port Trust would break down, and it might well be that the port would lose a great part of its present importance owing to a diminution in efficiency. Mr, Lalljee handed to us copies of recent memorials to the Viceroy and to Sir Samuel Hoare on the matter; the former is dated from Bombay the 19th March: our copy of the latter is undated, but it is clearly later in date than the 18th April, as that is the date of a meeting held at the Indian Salt Association Office which is recorded in an appendix to the memorial. In view of the definite interest which the Colonial Office has in this question would it be too much to ask that, if these petitions have not already been answered, we should be consulted 'before replies are sent? We have been aware, of course, that the position of the salt industry at Aden would need careful con sideration when the time for the transfer comes and we have had some correspondence with the Resident on4 . the matter. Reilly has asked that consideration should he given to the position in order that the salt industry should not he prejudiced. We have, however, up to the present regarded this as a question which would have to he settled when other matters relating to the transfer were under examination. Moreover, we have realized that the views of the Government of India, as expressed in 1933, were that it would he for the Indian Legislature of the future to decide what treatment should he accorded to salt from Aden. Government of India telegram of the 31st August, 1933, to the Secretary of State for India, a copy of which was enclosed in your official letter No. P. Z. 3456/33 of the 1 st September- 1933, refers to this. Mr. Lalljee, hov/ever, pressed strongly that consideration should he given to the insertion of some provision in the Government of India Bill to safeguard the position of the Aden salt manufacturers. He said that there was already a provision in the Government of India Bill safeguarding the position of trade between India and Burma. I presume that it is clause 443 to which he refers. There seems to he considerable similarity between the position in Burma, which is also being separated5. from India, and that at Aden, and the fact that these special provisions are being made for Burma seems to afford a precedent justifying a reconsideration of the 1933 decision, if in fact the views then expressed amounted to a decision. Moreover in view of the very serious loss of revenue to the Aden Administration which would result from a decline in the Aden salt industry, there certainly seems to he ’prima facie 1 a case for making some provision, such as is suggested, in the Bill, unless there are factors in the case (of which we are unaware) which make it impossible. I think that the Treasury, who might be faced with having to make a grant-in-aid to the Aden Settlement if revenue declines, might very well w r ish to support such a proposal and it is possible that the Service Departments also would wish to express their views on the subject, since clearly any drastic reduction in the lighterage and labour force available at Aden might seriously affect their plans for the despatch of stores and reinforcements in the event of war on the Indian frontier or in the Par East. Would you kindly let me have your views on the matter? Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) H.R. COTOLL.Draft Paper.

The Joint Parlia- emary Committee Report on Indian Constitutional Reform states that mL ^ 0/ ^ iS largelV dUe t0 rndtan enterprise and Mere betw ,ndmn ca l ntal is engaged.” A very considerable trade so ill' India and Aden avera 8 :ln « in value in normal time to about salt ■ h &lt;1932 ~ 33) an nually has grown up. Of the exports from Aden, an l y fSr thC largest single ltem ' being over Rs. 20 lakhs annually on verage In value out of a total of about Rs. 21 lakhs. In return are P rtS a va *iety of articles to Aden the most important of which ce, wheat, food grains, pulses, flour, tea, jute, jute fabrics, textilesand sugar. On the whole the balance of trade is against Aden and in favour of India. During the ten years 1923-24 to 1932-33 Aden sold Rs. 2.09,28,441 worth of merchandise to India (including ’ salt worth Rs. 2,03,14,545) while she took Rs. 5,57,96,113 worth of merchandise from India. The salt works alone contribute by way of income-tax, royalty, ground rent, port trust, tolls and municipal taxes over Rs. 5 lakhs annually to the revenues of British India exclusive of the receipts from the salt excise duty. These conditions would be wholly altered by the fact of separation. The above figures relate to the trade of Aden with Bombay and Karachi as well as Bengal. It may be mentioned that so far as Bengal Bombay and Karachi are concerned, there is a greater reciprocity of Adens- trade with Bengal than with other ports, in the sense that Bengal's export trade with Aden is intimately bound up with the imports of salt into Bengal through facilities of shipping. If the salt imports from Aden were reduced and consequently return freight was not available, it is obvious that the price of Aden salt would go up. Likewise the prices of produce from India will also be adversely affected owing to freight for Aden being not freely available if salt shipments cease or are materially reduced It may also be pointed out that the Government should have a greater concern for Aden salt than for salt even from Indian states, from the point of view of revenue, because the latter makes no contribution to the Indian Exchequer, while Aden is a source of considerable revenue to the Government. The large export trade of Aden in salt has made it possible for specially low rates of freight to be offered by ships returning to Aden after delivering their cargo of salt in Calcutta, thereby stimulating the Indian export trade. Aden is primarily a distributing centre for this trade and its prosperity depends upon the wealth of this trade. In its own turn, the wealth of this trade depends largely on the imports of salt from Aden. The bankers of Aden are mostly Indians, so that the finance Aden s trade, and therefore its prosperity, is inextricably bound up with the system of credit followed by the Indian community of Aden. The Port Trust of Aden and the Settlement Committee of Aden, both of whom derive a Irge revenue from the Salt Works and from the shipment of Salt from Aden to the tune of about 300,000 tons of salt annually, have opined by unanimous resolutions that the Aden Salt ustry is the principal industry in Aden which gives employment to a siderable number of people and that any inequality of treatment in India this industry will, therefore, have serious effects and further in conse quence the financial position of the Port and Settlement of Aden will also be adversely affected. They also strongly urge the fact that the balance bf trade between Aden and India is greatly in favour of India and they ould therefore, claim that it is to the advantage of India that Aden Salt should continue to receive equal treatment with Indian Salt and preference over foreign salt specially from Red Sea Ports and Germany order that the import trade from India to Aden may continue on the Present scale.— 3 It may also be mentioned that the large number of labourers, boats, lighters and tugs maintained in the harbour and the Port of Aden owing to their employment for the enormous shipments of salt, have always contributed to the development of the Port of Aden in as much as the shipping have found in them a great facility for being able to load and unload not only economically but also very expeditiously and efficiently and we submit that this is not a negligible asset for strategically important coaling and distributing Port of Aden which protects the Empire’s important routes and encourages its trade. During the Great War the Port of Aden with the people of the Settlement ungrudgingly, nay, voluntarily placed all these facilities, resources and their personal services at the of the Empire and they are proud that they were able to give a good account of themselves in every manner. The continual dredging of the Port in order to afford comfortable and safe berths for larger boats coming in every day and the high sanitary care are the chief activities of our Port Trustees and members of the Settlement Committee. Aden is at present a free port and on this fact depends to no small extent the importance of Aden as a Distributing Centre. A promise has, indeed, been made that Aden will continue to be a free port even if it is separated from India. The history of Somaliland Protectorate, however, does not encourage the trading and commercial interests of Aden to rely too much on this promise. We apprehend that the proposed transfer is the beginning of the end of the Indian commercial community at Aden. We now beg to draw your Excellency’s attention to the actual position of India’s supply and demand of salt. Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam are the only Provinces which do not produce salt. The Indo-Aden Salt Works was the only Indian salt works at Aden in 1927. The Hajeebhoy Aden Salt Works, Ltd., and the Little Aden Salt Indus- trial Co., were floated later. Prior to 1929, Bengal got its salt supply largely from foreign salt importers at the Red Sea littoral. They virtually monopolised the market and kept the rates high so much so that during the Great War the price of salt went up to over Rs. 200 j- per 100 maunds. The Tariff Board instituted an inquiry in 1928 and submitted its findings to the Legislative Assembly. A salt duty on the import of foreign salt was imposed and since that day the import of foreign salt mostly from the Red Sea has considerably decreased. The production of salt in India proper has not reached even to the extent of 50% of the total requirements of the Bengal Market which is about 5,40,000 tons per year in between Calcutta and Chittagong. Salt from Aden Works, however, meet with the supplies to the required extent. If the export of salt from Aden was insufficient, the Red Sea foreigners specially Italian and Hamburg Salt (German,) would have got a chance to come in at once and exploit the Market which had to be supplied the deficit from sources other than at Aden and in India proper. Aden has thus enabled the consuming Provinces, namely, Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam to secure their salt requirement at the rate of Rs. 501- per 100 maunds against the rate of about 751- per 100 maunds, the rate which prevailedAs the these cons The positioi Mie the tut' nils. Thelti lit mil conce a rent of Rs. it of Rs. 8.7J0 nported. The lee «they regular ^tatiSaltWor ' s,re lht rates | wuies for i 'insane Bur ttia and4 for many years, before protection to Salt Industry was granted. Aden exports salt to Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam and also imports Bengal produce to a larger extent annually. On account of this reciprocity in trade both Bengal and Aden are able to secure cheap freight in mutual interest. As the Works in India proper have not been and will not be able to meet with the entire salt requirements of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam these consuming Provinces will have to depend for thedefit upon outside sources. It must also be remembered that during the period of monsoon salt cannot be manufactured in India. So practically for at least four months in a year fresh imports of salt shall have to be arranged from one of the outside sources. The position of salt works at Aden, in our humble opinion, should determine the future relations of Aden with India. The salt industry has been primarily responsible for the prosperity of Aden. This prosperity has been achieved through the terms and conditions of the leases under which they are working. These terms and conditions are in no way generous. The Italian Salt Works at Aden pay Rs. 1,0001- annual ground rent and 0|8|0 per ton Royalty on salt exported while two of the other three Indian concerns have to pay each becides 0j8|0 per ton Royalty also a ground rent of Rs. 7,0001- annually, and the third one has to pay a ground rent of Rs. 8,770|8j0 annually, besides 0|8|0 per ton Royalty on salt exported. The lease of the Italian concern is for a period of 100 years while the leases of the Indian concerns are only for 30 years each. In addition to this they regularly pay large sums to Aden Port Trust and Aden Settlement Commmittee (Municipality) and suffer many other difficulties. The Massowah, Assab and Ras-Hafun Salt Works (Italian) and the Djibouti Salt Works (French) in the Red Sea littoral together can export to India 150,000 tons of salt. They not only pay no royalty and taxes but receive considerable help in the way of subsidy, protection etc., from their respective Governments. Karachi and Kathiawar works pay no royalty. The freight rates for Aden to Bengal, Assam and Burma are not cheaper than freight rates from Foreign European ports because the foreign European countries maintain special freight rates for salt in order to give more facilities for their general exports to India. It is only because there are rice, grains and piecegoods shipments to Aden and Arabian ports from Bengal, Burma and Bombay and as Aden is also a coaling port that she is not so badly off as she would otherwise be. The competition for tonnage which is likely to become acute with the development of salt manufacture- at contiguous ports (i.e., Massowah, Assab, Ras-Hafun) is likely to threaten the salt trade, not only of Aden but also of Karachi—Kathiawar through a rise in freight, if protection is not provided against the subsidised foreign salt works in Red Sea which may even divert trade to those ports. Inspite of these disadvantages the Aden Salt Works rendered valuable services during and since the War. Justice demands that their services should be recognised. Aden has never faltered in making steady shipments to India to serve the Bengal market. It supplied cheap salt to the consumers and has been the chief bulwark against the possibilityof any foreign combine doing harm to consumers of Bengal. The quality of Indo-Aden salt has been held by the Tariff Board as the quality of salt mostly required by Bengal. Moreover, there are heavy liabilities put upon us in the leases that we have, on behalf of the Government of India with the Secretary of State for India. Some of the important conditions in the leases wc-e included ostensibly in the interest of India which has always required imported clean white salt. We enumerate these conditions below and submit that they deserve serious consideration: (a) And at their own expense shall and will construct and complete the salt works upon the said premises within two years from the date of these present and from and after the expiration of such two years from the date of these presents at their own expense shall during the remainder of this demise to the satisfaction of Government use, maintain and keep in good condition and com plete repair of salt works for the purpose of cultivating or manu facturing salt and shall cultivate or manufacture salt thereon in a fair proper and usual manner according to the most approved method of course of salt cultivation or manufacture. &lt;b) Will pay at the office of the Political Resident at Aden or such other office in Aden as they shall be required by Government on the 31st day of October in each year, the annual rent of Rs 7,000(- and will within 24 hours after loading each shpment of salt for export pay without any deduction at the office aforesaid the said royalty or sum of eight annas for every ton of salt sc shipped for export by or for them or on their account. (O And will at all times during the continuance of this demise on demand sell to Government at such rates as Government and the Lessees may from time to time agree upon, but not exceeding rupees two and annas eight per ton such of the salt cultivated or manufactured on the said premises as Government may require for Aden local consumption or for export places and ports of the Aiabian Littoral situated between latitude eleven and latitude twenty north and longitude thirty-nine and longi tude foity-five east such salt to be delivered by the Lessees free of all furthei cost or expenses on the premises hereby demised at such times and in such quantities as Government from time to time direct. And will export by sea to pdrts or places other than ports or places on the Arabian Littoral situated between latitude eleven and latitude twenty north and longitude thirty-nine and longitude forty-five east all salt removed from the said premises and not sold to Government or with the consent of Government for Aden local consumption provided nevertheless that all such exported salt as may or shall be imported into British territory shall be liable to the import duties there payabl6 (e) And shall not sell any salt for Aden local consumption other than to Government without permission in writing first had and obtained of Government, who shall be entitled at any time and in any particular case to with-hold such permission or to with draw, suspend or cancel any such permision or to withdraw, sus pend or cancel any such permission as may have been granted. (f) And will not use or permit the said pieces cr parcels of land to be used for purposes other than for the cultivatiion or manufacture of salt and salt works. We had entered into the leases with the Government of India and have invested lakhs of rupees in the belief that Aden would ever remain a part of India and we never thought nor did we have an occasion to think that it would be separated from India. All these considerations point to the validity of Aden’s claim to be included in a scheme of protection for the salt industry of India, as ad mitted in para 10 of the third report of the Salt Industry Committee of the Legislative Assembly (March, 1933). The consideration of its claim to participate in the advantages of a scheme of protection for the Salt Industry of India, if Aden ceased to be a part of British India, is also- recognised therein. Aden has never stood or operated against India’s -sources of Salt Supply. It did not ask for any indulgence in the past, but the position of the entire Salt Industry (inclusive of Aden) is now threat ened by the cut-throat competition forced mostly by Red Sea foreign salt interests on the one hand and by the proposal of transfer of Aden to British Colonial Office on the other. The latter will have the effect at one stroke of placing what pre-eminently is an Indian Industry into the category of foreign undertakings to the evident relief of the Italian and other Continental concerns. The Report of the Joint Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform makes no recommendation for the preven tion of measures, legislative or administrative, which might subject Aden goods specially Aden salt, imported into India from Aden, to discri minatory or penal treatment as has been recommended in the case of British Goods. (Page 205, Para 345 of Vol I Part I of the Joint Parlia mentary Committee’s Report). This glaring omission in the Report is incomparatible with the traditional British policy for justice and fairplay. May we venture to express the hope that this admitted wrong to the cause of Indian producers whose produce is exported to Aden and also of consumers of salt in Bengal and the Indian salt manufacturers in Aden will soon be righted! In conclusion we beg to point out that with reference to the separa tion of Burma the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Indian Consti tutional Reforms recommend: “We refer to the case of companies established already in Burma with United Kingdom personnel and United Kingdom capital Such companies have established themselves in Burma as Province of Bri-tish India and W6 tliink that it would evidently be inequitable if after the separation of Burma, they are in a less favourable position in respect of their operations in British India than a company established at the same time and under the same conditions in, say Bombay or Bengal.” It is incongruous that whereas Indian merchants at Aden will be similarly placed as British merchants in Burma in the event of the transfer of these territories from India, they should be treated differen tially. We claim the same privileges and rights as are proposed to be accorded to British Merchants in Burma when it is no longer an integral part of India. Your Memorialists, therefore most respecfully pray that your Excellency’s Government will bring pressure to bear upon His Majesty’s Government to devise provision to be embodied in the terms upon which the administration of Aden is to be transferred to ensure that the various Indian interests affected by it are not prejudiced and that the Aden salt be permitted to be imported into India without being- treated as a manufacture of a foreign country.

The Government of India would only observe that they have throughout attached great importance to the protection of Indian interests in Aden, and they assume that the assurances contained in the Joint Parliamentary Committee Keport will so far as possible be implemented in due course when ••*•2 when provisions are framed for the future Sovernment of Aden, g.

They are further prepared to agree that a proportion of Indian service personnel shall be retained for some years after the date of transfer that no racial discrimination shall be permitted; and that British India subjects shall be allowed to enter the Protectorate under precisely the same conditions as any other British subjects'* Council regard with serious apprehension that India Bill contains no provisions implementing these assurances.

May it please Your Excellency, We beg to approach your Excellency once again in connection with the transfer of Aden from the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Indian Consti tutional Reform has recommended that the administration of the Settlement of Aden should be transferred to His Majesty’s Government not later than the date of the establishment of Federation (Page 90 Para 162 Vol. I Part I). It is indeed surprising that inspite of Indians’ protest since 1921 when the question of the transfer was first mooted and notwithstanding the Government’s oft-repeated assurances to the contrary the Joint Parliamentary Committee has recommended the transfer. We, however, fully recognise that it is a fait accompli and to conceal that fact is merely to evade the issue. The object of your Memorialists is to draw your Excellency’s attention to the fact that the transfer of Aden to His Majesty’s Government will ultimately cause the ruination of Indian Salt Manufacturers at Aden where they have established under every security of public faith and will seriously prejudice the entire trading relation between India and Aden. Moreover, we have grave doubts as to the material benefit likely to accrue to Aden as a result of its separation from India. It is not necessary at this stage to go into the history of the controversy of the transfer of Aden but a few fact briefly stated will substantiate our contention that the interest of salt consumers in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam find no safeguards in the proposed scheme which also involves inequitable treatment to Indian salt manufacturers at Aden. India has been trading with Aden even before the Settlement was annexed to British India about a hundred years ago. The Joint Parlia mentary Committee Report on Indian Constitutional Reform states that the development of Aden is largely due to Indian enterprise and where much Indian capital is engaged” A very considerable trade between India and Aden averaging in value in normal time to about 50 lakhs (1932-33) annually has grown up. Of the exports from Aden, sal t is by far the largest single item, being over Rs. 20 lakhs annually on an average in value out of a total of about Rs. 21 lakhs. In return India exports a variety of articles to Aden the most important of which are rice, wheat, food grains, pulses, flour, tea, jute, jute fabrics, textilesand SU8 ' ar - ° n the Whole the ba lance of trade is against Aden and in favour of India. During the ten years 1923-24 to 1932-33 Aden sow Rs. 2,09.28,441 worth of merchandise to India (including' salt worth Rs. 2,03,14,545) while she took Rs. 5,57,96,113 worth of merchandise from India. The salt works alone contribute by way of income-tax royalty ground rent, port trust, tolls and municipal taxes over Rs. 5 lakhs annually to the revenues of British India exclusive of the receipts from the salt excise duty. These conditions would be wholly altered by the fact of separation. The above figures relate to the trade of Aden with Bombay and Karachi as well as Bengal. It may be mentioned that so far as Bengai Bombay and Karachi are concerned, there is a greater reciprocity of Adens trade with Bengal than with other ports, in the sense that Bengal’s export trade with Aden is intimately bound up with the imports of salt m o Bengal through facilities of shipping. If the salt Imports from Aden were reduced and consequently return freight was not available it is obvious that the price of Aden salt would go up. Likewise the prices of pro uce Irom India will also be adversely affected owing to freight for Aden being not freely available if salt shipments cease or are materially reduced may alS ° be POinted out ‘he Government should have a greater -oncern for Aden salt than for salt even from Indian states, from the point of view of revenue, because the latter makes no contribution to the Indian Exchequer, while Aden is a source of considerable revenue to the Government. The large export trade of Aden in salt has made it possible for specially low rates of freight to be offered by ships returning to Aden a ter delivering their cargo of salt In Calcutta, thereby stimulating the ndian export trade. Aden is primarily a distributing centre for this trade and its prosperity depends upon the wealth of this trade. In its own turn, the wealth of this trade depends largely on the imports of salt rom Aden. The bankers of Aden are mostly Indians, so that the finance Aden s trade, and therefore its prosperity, is inextricably bound up with he system of credit followed by the Indian community of Aden. The Port Trust of Aden and the Settlement Committee of Aden, both of whom derive a Irge revenue from the Salt Works and from he shipment of Salt from Aden to the tune of about 300,000 tons of salt annually, have opined by unanimous resolutions that the Aden Sait stry is the principal industry in Aden which gives employment to a nsiderable number of people and that any inequality of treatment in India lo this industry will, therefore, have serious effects and further in conse quence the financial position of the Port and Settlement of Aden will also be adversely affected. They also strongly urge the fact that the balance f trade between Aden and India is greatly in favour of India and they ould therefore, claim that it is to the advantage of India that Aden Salt should continue to receive equal treatment with Indian Salt and Piefeience over foreign salt specially from Red Sea Ports and Germany order that the import trade from India to Aden may continue on the Present scale.It may also be mentioned that the large number of labourers,, boats, lighters and tugs maintained in the harbour and the Port of Aden owing to their employment for the enormous shipments of salt, have always contributed to the development of the Port of Aden in as much as the shipping have found in them a great facility for being able to load and unload not only economically but also very expeditiously and efficiently and we submit that this is not a negligible asset for strategically important coaling and distributing Port of Aden which protects the Empire’s important routes and encourages its trade. During the Great War the Port of Aden with the people of the Settlement ungrudgingly, nay, voluntarii ^P^ ac ^ a11 these facilities, resources and their personal services at the^ oi^the Empire and they are proud that they were able to give a good account of themselves in every manner. The continual dredging of the Port in order to afford comfortable and safe berths for larger boats coming in every day and the high sanitary care are the chief activities of our Port Trustees and members of the Settlement Committee. Aden is at present a free port and on this fact depends to no small extent the importance of Aden as a Distributing Centre. A promise has,. Indeed, been made that Aden will continue to be a free port even if it is separated from India. The history of Somaliland Protectorate, however, does not encourage the trading and commercial interests of Aden to rely too much on this promise. We apprehend that the proposed transfer is- the beginning of the end of the Indian commercial community at Aden. We now beg to draw your Excellency’s attention to the actual position of India’s supply and demand of salt. Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam are tne only Provinces which do not produce salt. The Indo-Aden Salt Works was the only Indian salt works at Aden in 1927. The Hajeebhoy Aden Salt Works, Ltd., and the Little Aden Salt Indus- trial Co., were floated later. Prior to 1929, Bengal got its salt supply largely from foreign salt importers at the Red Sea littoral. They virtually monopolised the market and kept the rates high so much so that during the Great War the price of salt went up to over Rs. 200j- per 100 maunds. The Tariff Board instituted an inquiry in 1928 and submitted its findings to the Legislative Assembly^ A salt duty on the import of foreign salt was imposed and since that day tne import of foreign salt mostly from the Red Sea has considerably decreased. The production of salt in India proper has not reached even to the extent of 50% of the total requirements of the Bengal Market which is about 5,40,000 tons per year in between Calcutta and Chittagong. Salt from Aden Works, however, meet with the supplies to the required extent. If the export of salt from Aden was insufficient, the Red Sea foreigners specially Italian and Hamburg Salt (German,) would have got a chance to come in at once and exploit the Market which had to be supplied the deficit from sources other than at Aden and in India proper. Aden has thus enabled the consuming Provinces, namely, Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam to secure their salt requirement at the rate of Rs. 50 j - per 100 maunds against the rate of about 75|- per 100 maunds, the rate which prevailedfor many years, before protection to Salt Industry was granted. Aden exports salt to Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam and also imports Bengal produce to a larger extent annually. On account of this reciprocity in trade both Bengal and Aden are able to secure cheap freight in mutual interest. As the Works in India proper have not been and will not be able to meet with the entire salt requirements of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam these consuming Provinces will have to depend for the debt upon outside sources. It must also be remembered that during the period of monsoon salt cannot be manufactured in India. So practically for at least four months in a year fresh imports of salt shall have to be arranged from one of the outside sources. The position of salt works at Aden, in our humble opinion, should determine the future relations of Aden with India. The salt industry has been primarily responsible for the prosperity of Aden. This prosperity has been achieved through the terms and conditions of the leases under which they are working. These terms and conditions are in no way generous. The Italian Salt Works at Aden pay Rs. l,000j- annual ground rent and 0|8j0 per ton Royalty on salt exported while two of the other three Indian concerns have to pay each becides 0|8|0 per ton Royalty also a ground rent of Rs. 7,000 - annually, and the third one has to pay a ground rent of Rs. 8,770j8;0 annually, besides 0j8j0 per ton Royalty on salt exported. The lease of the Italian concern is period of 100 years while the leases of the Indian concerns are only for 30 yea^s^ch^Ii^addition to this they regularly pay large sums to Aden Port Trust and Aden Settlement Commmittee (Municipality) and suffer many other difficulties. The Massowah, Assab and Ras-Hafun Salt Works (Italian) and the Djibouti Salt Works (French) in the Red Sea littoral together can export to India 150,000 tons of salt. They not only pay no royalty and taxes but receive considerable help in the way of subsidy, protection etc., from their respective Governments. Karachi and Kathiawar works pay no royalty. The freight rates for Aden to Bengal, Assam and Burma are not cheaper than freight rates from Foreign European ports because the foreign European countries maintain special freight rates for salt in order to give more facilities for their general exports to India. It is only because there are rice, grains and piecegoods shipments to Aden and Arabian ports from Bengal, Burma and Bombay and as Aden is also a coaling port that she is not so badly off as she would otherwise be. The competition for tonnage which is likely to become acute with the development of salt manufacture at contiguous ports (i.e., Massowah, Assab, Ras-Hafun) is likely to threaten the salt trade, not only of Aden but also of Karachi—Kathiawar through a rise in freight, if protection is not provided against the subsidised foreign salt works in Red Sea which may even divert trade to those ports. Inspite of these disadvantages the Aden Salt Works rendered valuable services during and since the War. Justice demands that their services should be recognised. Aden has never faltered in making steady shipments to India to serve the Bengal market. It supplied cheap salt to the consumers and has been the chief bulwark against the possibility? of any foreign combine doing harm to consumers of Bengal. The quality of Indo-Aden salt has been held by the Tariff Board as the quality of salt mostly required by Bengal. Moreover, there are heavy liabilities put upon us in the leases that we have, on behalf of the Government of India with the Secretary of State for India. Some of the important conditions in the leases were included ostensibly in the interest of India which has always required imported clean white salt. We enumerate these conditions below and submit that they deserve serious consideration:— (a) And at their own expense shall and will construct and complete the salt works upon the said premises within two years from the date of these present and from and after the expiration of such two years from the date of these presents at their own expense shall during the remainder of this demise to the satisfaction of Government use, maintain and keep in good condition ahd com plete repair of salt works for the purpose of cultivating or manu facturing salt and shall cultivate or manufacture salt thereon in a fair proper and usual manner according to the most approved method of course of salt cultivation or manufacture. &lt;b) Will pay at the office of the Political Resident at Aden or such other office m Aden as they shall be required by Government on the 31st day of October in each year, the annual rent of Rs 7,000|- and will within 24 hours alter loading each shpment of salt for export pay without any deduction at the office aforesaid tha said royalty or sum of eight annas for every ton of salt so shipped for export by or for them or on their account. (O And will at all times during the continuance of this demise on demand sell to Government at such rates as Government and the Lessees may from time to time agree upon, but not exceeding rupees two and annas eight per ton such of the salt cultivated or manufactured on the said premises as Government may require for Aden local consumption or for export places and ports of the Arabian Littoral situated between latitude eleven and latitude twenty north and longitude thirty-nine and longi tude forty-five east such salt to be delivered by the Lessees free of all further cost or expenses on the premises hereby demised at such times and in such quantities as Government from time to time direct. And will expoit by sea to ports or places other than ports or places on the Arabian Littoral situated between latitude eleven and latitude twenty north and longitude thirty-nine and longitude forty-five east all salt removed from the said premises and not sold to Government or with the consent of Government for Aden i l0Cal cons umption provided nevertheless that all such exported salt as may or shall be imported into British territory shall be Lable to the import duties there payabl6 f (e) And shall not sell any salt for Aden local consumption other than to Government without permission in writing first had and obtained of Government, who shall be entitled at any time and in any particular case to with-hold such permission or to with draw, suspend or cancel any such permision or to withdraw, sus pend or cancel any such permission as may have been granted. (f) And will not use or permit the said pieces or parcels of land to be used for purposes other than for the cultivatiion or manufacture of salt and salt works. We had entered into the leases with the Government of India and have invested lakhs of rupees in the belief that Aden would ever remain a part of India and we never thought nor did we have an occasion to think that it would be separated from India. All these considerations point to the validity of Aden’s claim to be included in a scheme of protection for the salt industry of India, as ad mitted in para 10 of the third report of the Salt Industry Committee of the Legislative Assembly (March, 1933). The consideration of its claim to participate in the advantages of a scheme of protection for the Salt Industry of India, if Aden ceased to be a part of British India, is also recognised therein. Aden has never stood or operated against India’s sources of Salt Supply. It did not ask for any indulgence in the past, but the position of the entire Salt Industry (inclusive of Aden) is now threat ened by the cut-throat competition forced mostly by Red Sea foreign salt interests on the one hand and by the proposal of transfer of Aden to British Colonial Office on the other. The latter will have the effect at one stroke of placing what pre-eminently is an Indian Industry into the category of foreign undertakings to the evident relief of the Italian and other Continental concerns. The Report of the Joint Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform makes no recommendation for the preven tion of measures, legislative or administrative, which might subject- Aden goods specially Aden salt, imported into India from Aden, to discri minatory or penal treatment as has been recommended in the case of British Goods. (Page 205, Para 345 of Vol I Part I of the Joint Parlia mentary Committee’s Report). This glaring omission in the Report is incomparatible with the traditional British policy for justice and fairplay. May we venture to express the hope that this admitted wrong to the cause of Indian producers whose produce is exported to Aden and also of consumers of salt in Bengal and the Indian salt manufacturers in Aden will soon be righted! In conclusion we beg to point out that with reference to the separa tion of Burma the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Indian Consti tutional Reforms recommend: “We refer to the case of companies established already in Burma with United Kingdom personnel and United Kingdom capital Such companies have established themselves in Burma as Province of Bri- SS-%7 tish India and we think that it would evidently be inequitable if, after the separation of Burma, they are in a less favourable position in respect of their operations in British India than a company established at the same time and under the same conditions in, say Bombay or Bengal.” It is incongruous that whereas Indian merchants at Aden will be similarly placed as British merchants in Burma in the event of the transfer of these territories from India, they should be treated differen tially. We claim the same privileges and rights as are proposed to be accorded to British Merchants in Burma when it is no longer an integral part of India. Your Memorialists, therefore most respecfully pray that your Excellency’s Government will bring pressure to bear upon His Majesty’s Government to devise provision to be embodied in the terms upon which the administration of Aden is to be transferred to ensure that the various Indian interests affected by it are not prejudiced and that the Aden salt be permitted to be imported into India without being treated as a manufacture of a foreign country.

December,1934* Dear Walton, In your letter of the 22nd November P* Z. 7156/34* you sent me a draft clause of a Bill to effect the separation of Aden from India, That clause imports a reference to the British Settlements Act which we consider both unnecessary and inadvisable, Aden is not a ^settlement’' of the nature to which the Act applies;and certain provisions of the Act,e,g. clause 3,might prove embarrassing. The Settlement of Aden was, I understand, acquired by conquest and purchase, but in view of its special relations with India we think it would probably be inexpedient to rely for its future administration on the exercise of the Royal Prerogative alone,and some enactment by Parliament seems to be necessary. But we think J. C. WALTON,ESQ. ,C.B.WM , '..L1, 5 think that this should take the form of a clause empowering His Majesty by Order in Council to make provision for the constitution of Aden and in general for its administration. Power should be given.without prejudice to the general power, to provide for the matters specially indicated in paragraphs 3 and 4 of ! —. the draft clause enclosed in your letter. As regards the question of the Kuria Muria Islands,raised in your letter P. Z 7155/34 of the 22nd November, we see no objection to their inclusion among other named dependencies in the definition of Aden in the Bill. Bushe will be happy to discuss with your Legal Adviser and Parliamentary Counsel the revise of this clause in the Bill, if they will let him know when it would be convenient. 7^L /M^'' ^ ^ ^ C&amp; 0 Vr*~+*~isfaj2~* *^ v &gt;- 160. The Settlement of Aden, which comprises the town of Aden Aden, itself and certain immediately adjacent districts, is at present administered by the Government of India as a Chief Commissioner’s 25 Province. Responsibility for the hinterland of Aden, which is commonly known as the Aden Protectorate and which is not British territory, has since 1917 rested with His Majesty’s Government, who have also since the same date been responsible for the military and political affairs of the Settlement. Under arrangements reached in 30 1926, an annual contribution, subject to a maximum of £150,000, but which amounts at the moment only to some £120,000, is made from Indian revenues to military and political expenditure on the Settlement and the Protectorate. The population of the Settlement is predominantly Arab, the Indian population, which is however of 35 great commercial importance, numbering only about one seventh of the whole. 161. Proposals for Indian constitutional reform inevitably Effect of necessitated consideration of the future position of Aden, and in constitu- particular of the question whether the Settlement could satisfactorily p°op 0sa { Si 40 be included in the new arrangements, or whether it would not be 1 preferable to transfer responsibility for its civil administration to His Majesty’s Government, in whom military and political respon sibility for the Settlement and complete responsibility for the affairs of the hinterland already vest. We have received strong represen- 45 tations against any alteration in the status of Aden from important 1 White Paper, Proposals 5, 56-60.Its separation from British India recom mended. and influential Indian interests. On the other hand we have received representations in favour of transfer from the Arab population who appear to view with some apprehension the possibility that Aden may permanently remain a part of British India. 162. We recognise the natural reluctance of Indian opinion 5 to sever a connection of almost a century’s standing with an - area the development of which is largely due to Indian enter prise and where much Indian capital is engaged. But great importance must also be attached to the interests and the feelings of the Arab majority of the population of the Settlement. We are 10 impressed, apart from this, by the geographical remoteness of Aden from India ; by the difficulties of merging it satisfactorily in a new Indian Federation ; by the impracticability of a complete divorce between the civil administration of the Settlement on the one hand and political and military control of the Settlement and Protectorate 15 on the other; and by the anomaly of including in such new con stitutional arrangements as may be approved for India an area pre dominantly Arab in population, already to some extent under Imperial control, and in practice inseparable from the Aden Pro tectorate for which India has ceased to be in any way responsible. 20 The constitutionally anomalous position which would arise in regard to Defence, if the present arrangements were allowed to continue under the new Constitution, would be particularly marked. We appreciate, moreover, the force in the argument that it is desirable on general grounds, given the importance of Aden from a strategic stand- 25 point to the Empire in the East as a whole, and not merely to any mcjvffiual unit, that its control should vest in the Home Government. After full consideration we are of opinion that the administration of the Settlement of Aden should be transferred from the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government not later than the date of the 30 establishment of Federation. In reaching this conclusion we have not ignored the apprehensions expressed by Indian interests con nected with Aden as to the possible prejudicial effect of a transfer upon their position. We have, however, ascertained that His Majesty’s Government are prepared in the event of transfer, not 35 meiely to relieve India of her annual financial contribution, but to preserve a right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court, to maintain (in the absence of any radical change in present economic circumstances) the existing policy of making Aden a free port to do their utmost to keep the administration at its present 40 standaid , and to impose no additional taxation unless in their opinion such a course is absolutely necessary. They are further piepared to agree that a proportion of Indian Service personnel shall e retained for some years after the date of transfer; that no racial discrimination shall be permitted; and that British-India subjects 45 sna 1 be allowed to enter the Protectorate under precisely the same conoitions as any otner British subjects. These assurances ought, in our view, adequately to meet the apprehensions to which we have rei erred above.4cZj ■ whole? The matter, of coarse, affects them closely, and it might perhaps be desirable to make sure that the proposed method of dealing with Aden - viz .. by applying the British Settlements Act, 1837 - is adequate and suitable from their point of view. On a further small point, it might also be as well to let them know of the proposed reference to the possibility of a contribution from the revenues of Aden towards the expenses of the Bombay High Court (even though this is only a power to be conferred on H.M. in Council). yj /-v. C2800 5000 5 34 H.R, Cowell, Esq., C.M.G., C.O. Will you please refer to previous ; correspondence on the subject of the separation of Aden from India? As regards the method of effecting this, we are considering a clause on the lines of the enclosed draft for i inclusion in any bill which emerges from the Report of the Joint Select Committee. As the matter affects the C.O. we shall, of course, be glad of any comments which you may have to make. (Si.) J. C.

The Kuria Muria Islands are situated about Long. 56 E. , Lat. 170 30* N. off the southern coast of Arabia, which here forms part of the dominions of Muscat. They are five in number. In 1926 the Political Agent, Muscat, reported that only one island was inhabited (by a patriarchal family of 35 persons). The islands were ceded in 1854 by Muscat to the British Crown. They were valuable only for their guano deposits (which were reported in 1926 to be exhausted). A licence was granted in 1856 to certain Briti^i subjects for five years to collect guano and other substances; this project failed, as the licensees’ employees were expelled by the Arabs. A British telegraph sta.tion was established in 1359, but removed in 1860 in consequence of failure of the cable. In 1931 some correspondence took place with Messrs. J. A. Hunter and J. Kunst of Harbin, who applied for permission to undertake guano fanning. Reports on the applicants were unfavourable, and their application w r as refused. In connection with this correspondence Col. Reilly, in his letter to t lie Govt, of Bombay oi 24th April, 1931, suggested that, though these islands were regarded as a dependency of the Aden Settlement, questions affecting them could more conveniently be dealt witn by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, since tne mainland adjacent to them was within his jurisdiction. Col. Powle agreed, pointing out that for air purposes the islands were already included within the area of ! responsibility of the A.O.C., Iraq, as it extended along the mainland to Has Shajir, a point westward of them, which was also the limit of the Political Resident’s jurisdiction/ 3/34jurisdiction. With the concurrence of the C.G. orders were accordingly given that control of the Kuria Muria Islands should be transferred from the Resident at Aden to the P.R. in the Persian Gulf. It would be desirable that this portion of British territory should be separated from India along with the Settlement of Aden, especially in view of the oossibility that the islands may acquire strategic importance as a result of the establishment of R.A. F. seaplane bases on the southern coast of Arabia. A draft d.o. letter to the C.Q. is submitted. J. C. WALTON 19.11.34.p.z. 7155/34, IHDIA OPPICS, V/HITDHALL, S.W.l. 22nd November, 1934. Dear Cowell, Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with C.O. letter of 16th October, 1931, ; 0 . 89277 / 31 , in which it was agreed that the control of the Kuria Muria Islands should be transferred from the Resident at Aden to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It is thought here that we ought to provide in the forthcoming Government of India Bill for the separation of these islands (which are British territory) along with Aden from India. Apart from the fact that they do not, geographically or naturally, form part of India, there is the possibility that they might at some future time acquire some degree of strategic importance. In this connection, please see Reilly’s letter of 84th April, 1931, to the Government of Bombay (enclosed with his despatch Ho. 96 to the Colonial Ofi ice), in v^hich he pointed out that the establishment of R.A.P. seaplane bases between Aden and the Persian Gulf is leading to increased contact with the neighbourhood of these islands. Separation from Irdia could be effected q„i^e easily by including them among other named dependencies of Aden - Shaikh Othman, Imad and Hiswa, Li-tie tden Perim - in the definition of Aden in the Bi-1 I am not sure whether this would make it necessary to go through the formality of reversing the administrative orders passed in 1931 which transferred tue c&gt; of S-1.Cowell, Esq.,C.M.G. , Colonial Office, S.W.l. islands/islands from tli© Hosiden't af Adsn 'to tii© Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. But if so, it would stil*’ seem possioxe, as a matter of administrative convenience, to arrange subsequently that any control should be exercised by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (acting in tiiis behs.-if as agent of the Home Government), if such arrangement snould at any future time be thought convenient in practice. Could you kindly let me know your views as earj .y as possiole? Xf the Colonial Office see no objection, we could confirm by official letters that the Kuria Muria Islands are to be regarded as one of the dependencies of the Aden Settlement.

THE RESIDENCY, Men ■ 7 April 1934, 5th enclosing a copy of a Confidential Memorandum regarding Aden which the Secretary of State has laid before the Joint Committee. I am glad to hear that there is no doubt that the Committee will recommend transfer. I should like very much to know when the transfer will take place, but you are probably not able to give me this information at present. I hope it will happen in my time. It is disappointing that the Government of India cannot give any guarantee about the Aden Salt Industry, but I hope that they will see their-way to grant Aden Salt preferential treatment, for which I think there is a strong case, Thank you very much for yourcongratulations on the conclusion of the treaty with the Imam. The mission was a most interesting one, and I am glad that this old dispute with our neighbour has been settled at last* J. C. Walton, Esquire, C.B*,M*C.,M.A., India Office, London*I would invite a reference to the memorandum which I submitted to the Joint Oommittee on 20th November (Record iio,9), in which I laid before my colleagues certain views which I had formed on the subject of the future of Aden. Paragraph 7 of that memorandum dealt with the factor of Arab interests in the consideration of the question of separating Aden from India. I now circulate for the information of the Joint Committee an important letter (Appendix A) received since that date from the Chief Commissioner, forwarding a translation of a representation received by him from Arab signatories who, he states, include nearly all the principal Arabs in the town of Aden. The desire expressed in this representation for the transfer of Aden to Colonial Office administration seems to me greatly to reinforce the arguments which have already been suggested in favour of separation. As it is desirable that the Committee in formulating any recommendations which they may see fit to make should be apprised of the views put forward in all quarters, I also bring to the notice of my colleagues tne attached telegraphic correspondence (Appendix B) with the Government of India, in which they state tneir views on ti;e question of transfer. It will be seen from their telegram of 12th October that the majority of tne Viceroys Council, when they considered the question in the ligntof the debates in me Indian Legislature in August and September last, were opposed to transfer. I felt that the Government of Inaia had not fully appreciated the arguments on the other side, and therefore sent them a telegram on 30th October setting out the reasons as they appear to me for taking the present opportunity of transferring Aden wholly to Imperial control. The matter was then again considered by the Government of India. It will be seen from their telegram of 17th November that some of the Viceroy’s Council adhere to their first views on the matter, having regard to the local sentiment in India in favour of the retention of Aden by India. On the other hand, others of the Viceroy’s Council, including the Commander in Chief, who had not been present when the question was first discussed, have placed on record their emphatic agreement with the arguments in favour of transfer which I have already suggested to the Committee. Sir B.L.Mitter, the Law Member of the Viceroy’s Council, is also in favour of transfer. VIith reference to the point which he makes in regard to safeguarding Indians against discrimination of any sort, I may mention that I have ascertained from the Colonial Office that they can certainly give an assuran.ce that in the event of transfer there will be no racial discrimination, either in legislation or in administration against Indian British subjects in Aden. It will be seen that the Government of India having, as they were bound to do, set out the local considerations in India in regard to the question of transfer, are content to leave it to the authorities in this country to weigh these considerations againsu tne Imperial interests involved (many of which the Governmentof India recognise to be beyond their ovm purview) and to arrive at a final decision in the matter. For my part, while I recognise that the views held by the members of the G-overnrnent of India on both sides of the question are entitled to serious consideration, I see no reason to modify the views which I tentatively placed before the Oommittee in my memorandum of 20th November, as I feel that any ill-effects that a decision to transfer Aden may have on Indian sentiment is more than counterbalanced by the Imperial and other advantages of such a step. I have thought it best to furnish my colleagues with the telegrams attached in full in the form in which they passed between the G-overnment of India and myself. Should the Committee think it desirable, in making any recommendation on the subject in their Report, to quote this correspondence, I would ask that I should be given an opportunity of considering whether any omissions or modifications are necessary, since the telegrams Yn r ere obviously not drafted with an eye to their publication.j-w APPENDIX A.

As stated in my telegram the signatories include nearly all the principal Arabs in the town. They are anxious that their views may be clearly represented before the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee which is considering the lihite Paper on Indian Constitutional Reforms. They are opposed to the inclusion of Aden within the new Indian Constitution, and, as stated in their representation, they desire its transfer to Colonial Office administration. 3.

That matters of marriage and divorce be conducted by a Moslem Qadhi chosen by the leading men oi the town, and that questions of inneritanee and 7[aqfs be decided in accordance with the Islamic Sheri*a law. 6. That the rights and interests of the Arabs be in Government service. maintained by appointing an adequate number oi them in proportion to their numbers in the town as members of both the local Settlement and Port Trust Boards. 7. That an advisory council to the Governor beestablished, on which the number of members representing the Arabs should be in proportion to the number of Arabs in the town.

IMPORTANT . 38 0 . Reference our telegram of the 3rd instant, 2400. Aden. 2. Having regard to the views expressed by all sections of Indian opinion in recent debates in the Assembly and Council of State, we strongly urge that when the future of Aden is considered, strength of genuine Indian sentiment in favour of retaining it as part of British India should be recognised. This sentiment can be met by maintaining broad features of the present arrangements under which the defence of Aden and relations with adjoining protectorate are a responsibility of his Majesty’s Government, while the civil administration alone is concern of the Government of India. We see no serious difficulty in carrying forward these arrangements into the new constitution. Civil administration would, as now, be entrusted to Chief Commissioner as officer subordinate to the federal Government, but subject to convention that the officer appointed by His Majesty's Government to hold charge of the protectorate and political relations with the interior would automatically be appointed Chief Commissioner by the federal Government. We trust that His Majesty’s Government may see their way to accept the arrangement on these lines, which would leave them free to protect themselves in any way, both as regards the^ defence of Aden and its use as strategic point. So littleis involved in the civil administration of the tom of Aden, that it nould seem politically most undesirable simply, for the purpose of effecting its transfer from the future federal Government, to embitter Indian feeling in a matter in which practical issues are of such minor importance. We would draw particular attention to this aspect of the case. It may perhaps be necessary at some future date for His Majesty f s Government to assume civil control of Aden, but to do so now would we feel be most unfortunate. We are at present preparing to hand over to India a large measure of control of her own aflairs and, in so doing, are demonstrating our trust in her future willingness to maintain the Imperial connexion. If, at the same time, we take from her what small measure of control she still exercises over the one Imperial link with wnicn she is directly connected, we shall incur the obvious criticism that our professions of trust are meaningless and that ^ do not believe either in her power or will to remain within the Empire. Such action on oar p-ib ^11, w6 teel, engender widespread resentment in Inaia and Wxll undoubtedly be a most unfortunate precursor to the introduction of the new constitute ion. 3. His Excellency the Viceroy, who was absent m Assam when the above opinion was formulated, concurs m these views which represent those of the majority of his Council. 4. Should His Majesty’s Government approve of these proposals, we will consider in detail the question ox including Aden in our proposals for the Cmef ^ Oommissioner's Provinces in the new Constitution.Copy cypher Government Department, telegram from.Secretary of State to °t foreign and Political aated oOtii October, 1933.

I have given fullest and most sympathetic consideration to your vieis and have closely studied deoates in Legislative Assembly and Council of State. But while I fully appreciate your arguments, and recognise, too, that eiiecu oi deoates must unfortunately be to crystallise opposition to transfer and afford a grievance, I remain of opinion that the only satisfactory solution of the Aden problem is tnat the Settlement should be separated from India not later than the date of Federation. Importance must, of course, attach to expression of opinion by Legislature. But it is common ground between us that its resolutions have no binding force in this matter; and fact that their resolutions were adopted in absence of any guidance from Government or any elaboration of the strong case for a transfer and the substantial safeguards offered by His Majesty f s Government makes it necessary to some extent to discount opinion recorded. 3. To remove aigy possibility of misunderstanding I think it desirable to elaborate in greater detail than I have hitherto done arguments,which are in my view decisive, in favour of immediate transfer. They are substantially: (a) Anomaly of including in new constitutional arrangements area already to some extent under Imperial control, inseparable in practice from Aden Protectorate for which India has ceased 'co be in an^ way responsible, geographically remote from India and2. predominantly Arab. Complete divorce between civil administration of Settlement on the one hand and political and military control of Settlement and Protectorate on the other would be impracticable. Existing condominium works efficiently only with some difficulty and in practice because in the last resort decision of all questions arising rests in His Majesty r s Government either directly or through Government of India. This would no longer be to the same extent the case under the new constitution. For defence purposes distinction between Protectorate and Settlement will in any event be impossible and it is therefore essential that defence of the latter as well as of former should continue to be direct responsibility of His Majesty r s Government. But if Settlement became part of Indian Federation a continuance of the present system whereby defence rests in His Majesty 1 s Government in respect of the Settlement as well as of the Protectorate would be constitutionally anomalous ana might give rise to most serious difficulties. Anomaly would be difficult if not impossible to defend effectively against criticism in Legislature and might lead to not illogical demand for retransfer of military control of Protectorate to Government of Inaia. You will appreciate too practical awkwardness of criticism in Legislature of action at Aden of forces in no way under their control, e.g.. in quelling not. (b) If dual control is not abolished now it will be mucn more difficult to abolish it later once Settlement has become incorporated in Federation. Issue is one which must in my view be faced now or not at all.3 . While I appreciate force of your argument for postponing decision objections seem to me overwhelming. (c) Indian population represents only l/8th of population of Settlement, though its financial interests are, of course, very important. As you will have seen from Chief Commissioner^ despatch No.0.403 of 15th July last Arab community while well satisfied with existing system are gravely apprehensive of possibility of Indianisation at Aden, and of subordination of Arab to Indian interests under reforms. Moreover, effective representation of Arab community in Indian Legislature would be extremely difficult nor would it be easv to feel entire confidence, even making all allowance for good will and fairness of legislature, that Indian might not preponderate over Arab interests in case of conflict. It is essential to give great weight in reaching present decision to interests of Arab inhabitants. (d) Strategic position of Aden and its importance from this aspect to Eastern Empire generally and not merely to 3 .U.J single unit is strong argument for control by Home G-overnment and decisive objection from Parliamentary standpoint to retention of existing condominium under new constitution. 4. Assurances already given by His Majesty s Government in my view cover all reasonable apprehensions, and I am disappointed at failure of legislatuie to recognise their generous character and at attempts of various speakers to distort them. In l 1 -r 3 nt of apprehensions expressed in deoate I have now secured however specific additional assurance from Colonial Office that in event of transfer Indian British subjectswould be allowed to eiitep Protectorate under orecisely same conditions as any other British subjects. 5. Colonial Office are further prepared to give assurance that all Indian administrative personnel serving in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modiiication by mutual consent. When vacancies occurred (though there would be gradual substitution of Colonial Service officers) Indians would remain eligible for appointment though on definite terms to be agreed in each case and on basis of Indian conditions of service only if these were specially imported into their agreements or letters of appointment. 6. On two further points arising out of debate I should like to add (a) that parallel with Somaliland drawn by Sethna was quite misleading. Somaliland ports have gone down because of inability of local administration, owing to unruly character of inhabitants, to levy any direct taxation with the result that administration depends entirely on import duties. Position at Aden is exactly the reverse as Aden is a free port and cost of administration is met by direct taxation. (b) Prominence of Salt question is understandable* But this is essentially a matter for the Indian Legislature, having regard to the Fiscal Convention. In view of solicitude shown in debate for commercial and other interests of Indians at Aden, Legislature may possibly be responsive to any appeal made by Sethna and his friends on behalf of Men salt manuiacturers when / Question arises. 7. I will endeavour to take an opportunity in immediate future either in the Joint Committee or inwmmmamm j / 4?4 discussion vrith Sethna and his friends to explain reasons for transfer and comprehensive character of assurances, and so to redress balance and emphasise true position. Meanwhile I shall he glad if you will urgently consider matter further, and let me have your observations by telegraph as early as possible.Copy,of cypher telegram from Government of India, Foreign and Political Deoartment, to Sooretary of State for India, dated Pei Delhi, 17th November, 1933, IMPORTANT . 2731. Your telegram of the 30th ultimo, 2658. Aden, 2. We have considered most carefully points of view expressed in this telegram. Some of us are not prepared, in spite of your arguments, to resile from attitude already expressed in our telegram of the 12th ultimo, 38-0, which gives local arguments in favour of the retention of Aden by India. These arguments are admittedly based on sentiment, but, as we have already said, Indian sentiment is likely to prove a most important factor in regulating the relations between the future Government of India and His Majesty's Government. Those of us who hold this point of view are not prepared to admit that practical difficulties against the retention of Aden settlement by India are so great as to outweigh advantages which would result from its inclusion in the Federation. The difficulties attendant on such a concession to Indian sentiment seem small, while its effect, at a time goodwill of informed Indian opinion in regard to new' constitution is of considerable value, would be great. 3. On the other hand, some of us have been considerably impressed by your arguments. In particular, His Excellency the Commander-in-Qhief, who was not present when the question was under consideration in October, desires us to place on record his emphatic agreement witn your point of view. In his opinion position at present is entirely anomalous. Aden is of too great importance to the Empire to be placed under divided control. The2 . protectorate and settlement must, from the defence point of view, he solely under the Government of India or under His Majesty's Government, and he is of opinion that, particularly in view of the transfer already effected of the defence of the protectorate to His Majesty's Government, the only logical and possible course is to transfer complete control of the settlement as leli. 4. Sir B.L.Mitter, who was also not present last month, concurs in the view that divided control is impossible and that, provided Indian interests are fully safeguarded, advantage lies in the transfer of complete control to His Majesty ! s Government. He presses, however, for a definite statement by His Majesty ? s Government granting full safeguards for Indians against discrimination of any sort vis-a-vis European or other traders in Aden. 5. In these circumstances, it appears to us that decision must finally rest with His Majesty r s Government. We have endeavoured in this, and in our previous telegram, to set before you local point of view. This point of view is entitled to the fullest consideration, but we feel that it is for His Majesty’s Government to decide whether it is sufficient to outweigh the considerations of imperial interests, many of which are beyond our purview. 6. We feel, therefore, that it is unnecessary for us to enter into a detailed consideration of the points raised in your telegram under reference. In regard, however, to salt interests raised in paragraph No.6(o), we would point out that we see no reason to arppose uhat future Indian Legislatures will assume an attitude different from that described in paragraphs 5 and 6 X of Tinance Department’s letter G • 55Gl/ L3, of the 13th Hehniary, la«jo. tract (Appendix 0) attached.APPENDIX C.

This observation does not preclude the possibility that the India Government and Legislature of the future might accord special treatment to Aden salt; but such a concession would have to be voluntary and terminable at the will of India.

Sir Muhammad Shah’s words will bear repetition, and there fore, with your permission, propose to quote them. He said: — sentmg ditterent interests, iney win note tne tact that Indian senti ment according to the various speakers is entirely opposed to this transfer. They will also take note of the fact, which has been positively stated by the Honourable Mr. Sethna and is endorsed bv the Bombay Government that local opinion in Aden as well as in Bombay is also opposed to the transfer. They will further take note H** t0 of the fact stated by the Honourable Rai Bahadur Lala Ram Saran : w®® ^ 18 Das, that in view of the position which Indians at present occupy in ^ different parts of Africa—parts that are under the control of the Colonial .^rhCbief’s i Office—Indians would prefer that Aden—their brethren, their country- I'-y jn both t men, residing in Aden—should remain under the control of the Govern- wgovernment i: retain* idea Till r&lt; ment of India rather than that Aden should be transferred to the expressed in the various speeches delivered by Honourable Members if the fact thi to-day will, the House may rest assured, be carefully borne in mind by i^tof the Government of India.

September, lie Honourable i which she fflied on the qu&lt; nnsfer of Aden meat of Bomba’ pronounced in favour of this transfer and until they do, no Honourable Member has any right to assume that they are in favour of that pro position. Their position is, as announced by the Honourable the Foreign Secretary, one of benevolent neutrality towards the Resolution moved by the Honourable Mr. Sethna. They prefer to leave this Resolution to the vote of the House. The official Members will take no part in the voting and Government will undoubtedly pay due regard to the final verdict of this House upon the Resolution moved by my Honourable friend.’ “ Mr. President, if this was the view that the Council held in September, 1921, I think I am perfectly justified in stating that the Council holds not only the same view to-day but holds it in a greatly intensified form. (Hear- smattitude hear.) Sir, even after 1921, there were occasional reports that Aden was an® one 0 f w going to be transferred, and in order to make sure on the point, questions a to the provision were asked both in this House and in another place to which very definite ^ replies were given by Government which I will quote. On 16th January, s;very little notic 1922, the then Law Member, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, in the Legislative Assembly said:— ^ ^ which the tr Government have no intention of arriving at any decision without :::lt o pini^ ^ giving the Assembly an opportunity of discussion.’ against the p “ Two years later, on 9th June, 1924, in answer to a question in this by the tradii House Sir John Thompson, the Foreign Secretary, observed as follows:— r the prese The matter of the transfer was under the consideration of His ' s ^ u * quo. Majesty’s Government and it was not possible to say when a ieBombay Goi decision would be arrived at but that before a final decision was arrived - &lt;iit followed j n at, the Indian Legislature would be given an opportunity to express tide by His its opinion.’ K^Mfloemen “ Such an opportunity, however, was not given to us, and this is where Government committed a breach of faith with the Legislature.

'Not only wm S Indian Legislature kept ,n the dark, but even the Provincial Government ,mmed,.tely concerned namely that of Bombay, was entirely in the dark and that ,n spite of the fact that the Government of India knew the v.ews of th Government of Bombay on the question.

Such was an occasion when I moved my LmmeV n rt eP H mber ’ I 1 ! 921 ' The then re P re sentative of the Bombay Government the Honourable Mr. Pratt, a Member of the Indian Civil nIT’ T .': 0r ‘! S wh,ch show “ d th “ feeling which the Government of Bombay entertained on the question of the transfer of Aden. He said: — “Z e transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office is a qmestion in which e Government of Bombay is deeply and closely interested. Towards question the attitude of the Bombay Government cannot in any circumstances be one of neutrality and I have been authorised to give xpression to the provisional views of the Bombay Government at this stage of the discussion of this question. Their position is that they ave had very little notice and indeed very little time for the con sideration of this question. They have had very little information of the grounds upon which the transfer has been considered. It is also a fact a public opinion both in Bombay and Aden has expressed itself very strongly against the proposed transfer. Very strong protests have een recorded by the trading communities of Bombay and Aden, and for a reason for the present the Bombay Government objects to any change in the status quo.’ Now, Sir, the Bombay Government have not changed their view's, as is eudent from what followed in the Bombay Council exactly a week after the announcement made by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief in the ssembly. That announcement, as I have already said, was made on 3rd arch, 1927. On 10th March, 1927, the Home Member of the Bombay 0 ;™ent, Sir Ernest Hotson, introduced a Bill called the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Bill in the Bombay Council and in regard to the 19356 A 2RECORDS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE 20° Novembris, 1933.] Memorandum by Sir Phiroze [Continued. ^ c Sethna, O.B.E., ON THE Future Constitution op Aden, statement made by the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Ernest 6 aid that the announcement came as a surprise to the Government of Bombay as much as to the general public. “ &lt; I am obliged to stress this point,’ said Sir Ernest, ‘because during the discussion on the Bill both I and my Honourable Friend the Chief Secretary assured several Honourable Members that we had no reason to suppose that a transfer was imminent, and indeed pointed to the fact that the Government of India had instructed us to proceed with the Bill as evidence that no immediate change was proposed. The details of* the future system of administration at Aden are not yet known to the Government of Bombay, which indeed knows nothing further than what has appeared in the Press.’ i riser interv .jx'l”* ifle Sehl* 5 The , this “ This Sir proves my statement that even the Provincial Government most directly concerned with the transfer was kept entirely in the dark. “ This was, as I have said in 1927. In January, 1929, when there were fresh rumours of the transfer, Questions were again asked and Sir Denys Bray gave a reply which consisted of two sentences which are very pertinent and to which I would respectfully request the earnest attention of Members of this Honourable Council. The first sentence was: — “‘I repeat my promises that the transfer of Aden from India will not be effected without this House being taken into consultation.’ .■digii 1 one. ^(iaaee now ol $11 ns Hon whic. “ Mark the words ‘ my promises,’ which I may add were not fulfilled. The next sentence is still more pertinent. He said. “‘I hasten to add that all idea of such a transfer has long since been abandoned.’ “Two years later, when the Aden administration was proposed to be transferred from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India there were also ruimiurs of a subsequent transfer from the Government of India to the Colonial Office. Thereupon those interested in the Aden trade thought it necessary to wait in a deputation on His Excellency the Viceroy The deputation was a very influential and representative one. It w he on His Excellency Lord Willingdon in November 1981 . The deputat on nointed out to the Viceroy that it was feared that in all probability the Ks£ from the Government of Bombay to the ^ve^ the thin end of the wedge and that it was but the first step to its sub ^ transfer to the Colonial Office. Now, Sir, mark the reply wta* on behalf of the Viceroy the then Foreign Secretary now Sir hvelyr H .m . gave to the deputation. He eaid, as regards the apprehension tha the proposed transfer was only a step towards the trans er o yiew Colonial Office, that the present proposals were m^e solely wth to improving Hie conditions and making an end of administrative venience at Aden. - . « “ ‘ The proposals were complete in themselves and were ma e on eir own merits without afterthought or ulterior motives of any km . ) were not a step towards any other change.’ “The deputation at first thought that His Excellency ^ * part in the discussion, but His Excellency, in order to Jly ‘he W * of the deputation, himself thought fit to add a few words endorsed the Foreign Secretary’s statement regarding the trans ^ Colonial Office that no such suggestion had been considered a ^ that, should it arise in future, all interests concerned would be co Ijuipatii! ffitli thi jit kecaose tl si euast only ( silt a Province i lat the diffie amt the dicul tit that if Aden jk perhaps the it in my sub »jtil adininistrat 31M)t.

How he hoped to surmount the dxfficulty he did not oay, but if I might venture an opinion l think that if Aden continued as before to remain lunder the Province of Bombay perhaps the difficulty could be removed. It is for that reason ur, that in my substituted motion I have said that if thought necessary GoUnment atl ° n ° f ^ be re - tra ^rred to the Bombay “ Now Sir, I turn to the Press communique to which the Honourable Leader of the House drew our pointed attention, and particularly to those points in it which he tholught we ought not to ignore in the course of our discussion. In the first place, I will deal with the three points in the communique as to why Aden should not remain linked with India Point No 1 says that Aden is geographically remote from India. If it is 1 600 miles away from India, the distance between Aden and the Colonial Office is two-and-a-half times that. I will leave it to the House to consider if this argument is sound. The next point is that it would not naturally fit into the new federation. I have already answered this contention by saying that even in the opinion of no less a personage than the Right Honourable the A-eeretary of State that difficulty is not insurmountable. I now come to the nx pourt and that is that it is already to some extent lunder Imperial control. The answer to that is that if it has passed out of our control, it was not with our agreement, it was so done ever our heads and in spite °t our protests. We are however now quite prepared to concede that for political and military considerations Aden may remain under the Imperial ;cr# 51 ^ . Then there are six points enumerated in the communique according to winch Government try to make out that India would not be a loser } the transfer. I will deal with them seriatim. “ Point No. 1, on which my Honourable Friend, the Leader of the Ho.use, tas laid particular stress is that India will be saved a burden of Rs. 20 lakhs a year. I dispute the figure of Rs. 20 lakhs and I shall endeavour to prove 19356 A QRECORDS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE 20° Novembris, 1933.] Memorandum by Sir Phiroze [Continued. C Sethna. O.B.E., ON THE Future Constitution oe Aden. that the figure is not correct. In no case are we expected to pay more than a maximum of £150,000, or, say, Rs. 20 lakhs according to the arrange ments made in 1927 and in accordance with the reply given this morning b y Government to a question asked by the Honourable Mr. Mehrotra the amount at present is about £119,000 or Rs. 16 lakhs. Now, against this Rs 20 lakhs Government must set off what the Government of India will lose in the shape of the revenlue which it derives from salt and also from income and super-tax. I make out roughly that Government will lose Rs 10 lakhs under the heads I have quoted. Let me give you the details ....J-Uj, i^oUinrr Snlt With regard to salt, the Government of India the latest figures, me export ui sent m a ^ axauuuucu w over 280.000 tons and consequently Government will lose Rs. 1,40,000. Government also get ground rent for kind where the salt is made which is it 11VI ” ucva. w / these two items alone exceeds Rs. lakhs. I explained that the Govern ment of India will lose Rs. 10 lakhs, and I pointed out how the loss is Rs. 5 1 lakhs or more under salt alone. The difference between Rs. 10 lakhs and Rs. 5\ lakhs is made up by the amount of income tax and super-tax under heads other than Salt. My estimate is on the conservative side and perhaps Government may lose more. I am glad that the Honourable the Leader of the House has said that if there are mistakes or misapprehensions in any statements we make he will correct them in the course of his reply and I do hope that he will be good enough to answer the point that I have made. ^ “ The Honourable the PRESIDENT: I request the Honourable Member to be aa brief as possible; he has already exceeded 20 minutes. “ the Honourable Sir PHIROZE SETHNA : I shall be very gratefnil if you will give us some latitude. Government require our views and I am endeavouring to give them. I am very grateful to you, Sir, for the latitude you have already extended to me and I shall be still more grateful if you will give me more time. “ The Honourable the PRESIDENT: I am only asking the Honourable Member to be as brief as possible. || ffl “ The Honourable Sir PHIROZE SETHNA: I shall be as brief as possible and avoid anything irrelevant. ' “ To come back to the Press commiunique, Item No. 2 says that the right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court would be main tained. If they do not allow appeals to be sent to the Bombay High Court, what would happen? They will have to be sent much further away to London instead of to Bombay; or to establish an Appeal Court in Aden which will be a costly process. It is therefore by no means a favour to the Bombay Government or to the Government of India if appeals will be sen to Bombay. “ Item No. 3 says that Aden would be made a free port unless some radical change in our present economic situation should take place. All these points have ‘ ifs ’ and ‘ ands ’ attached to them for they say ‘ if ’ there is maintained and they would not impose any additional taxation unless you there is ‘ unless ’ here again—unless such a course becomes in eir jjlfd a Utile loss to j is tie la o racial leg :J jl fill toll?

The communique says that a proportion of Indian service administrative personnel would be retained in the Aden service—and please note— a proportion 5 will be retained and the rest will be sent away, and even the proportion that is retained will be retained ‘ for some years, which means that at the earliest opportunity they will be asked to go away. And what is more important, in the future under the Colonial administration no more Indians will be taken, which will also be some little loss to this country in the matter. “ Then there is the last item, which is perhaps the most important of all I is said no racial legislation or segregation would be permitted by His Majesty s Government Now, Sir, we have very grave doubts if in spite of this assurance that Government will be able to maintain this promise for long. I will tell you why? His Majesty’s Government must carry out a uniform Colonial policy. If they favour and discriminate in favour of Asiatics m Aden, there is bound to be a clamour on the part of Europeans in the other Colonies to which Government will have to yield as they have yielded m the past and they are yielding every day. Therefore these assurances are all paper assurances. They will last only for months or years and the position of Indians in Aden will become the same as the position of Indians m Kenya or other Colonies. And that, Sir, is our most serious objection to the transfer. Experience tells us that we have suffered else where and we are bound to suffer here as well, in spite of all promises and pledges to the contrary. “ Now, Mr. President, I will in accordance with your wishes be brief although I have much more material to add. I will enumerate the objec tions which we entertain against the proposed transfer. They are manv but I will content myself at present with only five. First. It has been said that we are fighting and agitating against this proposed transfer merely on the ground of sentiment. If we do so are we not justified? Indians have been in Aden even before the British Vent there The British acquired Aden 94 years ago in 1839. Indians were there before that time and because of the encouragement given by British officers more Indians followed the British flag and particularly because they had assurances that Aden would ever remain a part of the Indian Empire. If they at any time had any doubts on the subject, because of Indian experience in other Colonies they would never have sunk their lakhs as they have done in buildings, shipping wharves, salt factories and in other concerns. They control in a great measure the trade of the Settlement. It will be no exaggeration to say that the barren rock of Aden with her population of 3,000 inhabitants has been converted into a prosperous port with a population of more than half a lakh by Indian men and money, by Indian resources and enterprise. It is therefore the duty of the Govern ment to give us a patient hearing and to do us justice. We do not want to go under Colonial administration because we know that in that event Indians will have to leave the Settlement for reasons that I will deal with in our second objection to which I now turn. “ Near Aden, as the Honourable House knmvs, is Somaliland. Somaliland was at one time administered by the Bombay Government. 'So long as it was administered by the Bombay Government, its three ports, Berbera, Bulhar and Zaila, were prosperous. They were going on from strength to strength. After the Somaliland War the Home Government thought it right to transfer Somaliland to the Colonial Office. With what result, Mr.—? — RECORDS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE 20° Novembris, 1933.] Memorandum by Sib Phiboze [Continued. C. Sethna, O.B.E., ON THE Future Constitution of Aden. President? These three ports are now practically dead. The population of Berbera has fallen from about 20,000 to 4,000 or less and likewise the others. And why, may I ask? Simply -because the Indian traders left these ports and the Arab and Jewish traders followed in their wake. They did so for the same reason, namely, that they did not want to be under Colonial administration. Colonial administration is distinctly costly. Because it is costly taxes have to be raised. The Somaliland ports were almost free ports but soon duties were imposed and increased to meet the higher cost of administration and the result was Indian, Arab and Jewish traders left and the trade of these ports has completely dwindled dawn. The same must perforce happen in Aden if Aden is transferred to the Colonial Office and I may not be alive, but our successors in this House will have occasion to say that I was a true prophet. “ In support of our third objection that Colonial administration is more costly let me give just one illustration. When Aden was under Bombay, a representation was made to the Bombay Government that two Indian educational inspectors be replaced by two Europeans with salaries almost if not actually double. Because education is a portfolio held by a Minister in Bombay, he stoutly opposed this, with the result that so long as Bombay was in charge of Aden, Aden did not get the two European educational inspectors. After Aden was transferred to the Government of India, the request was repeated and granted and two European inspectors have been sent. The same thing will happen in all other departments and in proof of that I may again refer the House to a press communique which says that only ‘ a proportion ’ of the Indians now there will be kept and that too only for a period of years. Now, Sir, talking of the extra cost of Colonial administration, I may say in passing what is thought of it in other parts of the Empire, I mean in other Colonies. I returned from Europe this day last week. On board the P. and O. steamer I came by were some fellow passengers who were civil servants from the Straits Settlements and the Malay States. We were comparing notes with regard to the different civil services. They volunteered the information that their cadre is far larger than should be the case as compared with the cadre of the Civil Service in this country. But at the same time they said they had very little work to do. I naturally inquired, why don’t you ask for reduction in the number of posts and more pay? They said such a proposal had been made, but the Colonial Office did not want to increase their pay, what they wanted was more posts. One of them said ordinarily they have four civil servants there to do the work that is done by one civil servant in this country. Therefore if Aden goes to the Colonial Office the number of appointments is bound to be increased and the cost will be so much more that Indian taxpayers who are the largest taxpayers there will have to pay a great deal more. “ Our fourth objection is that the trade of India to-day runs to some crores of rupees—seven or eight crores or more. This is to some extent due to shipping facilities that exist, by which I mean that because there are salt factories in Aden from which salt has to be imported into India and rather than that those ships go empty to Aden to bring this salt, there is shipped from this country by these boats a large amount of Indian produce and that helps to reduce the rate of freight. What goes there is rice, wheat, grains, tea, funnies, piece-goods, etc.—not from Bombay and Karachi alone but from Malabar, Calcutta, and even Chittagong, Akyab and Ran goon. And why? Because Aden is a distributing port and this produce .^lien’s popuW S ^&gt;41 will .just briefly MOO of 1^1 , the rinjoi 1 the A: _ rated, they 12 years has e rg’stioi and in th ptiiey as veil a. 3 flat the presen' iy no fear of thei: k we: -sfc, That was aratation had hi few days sen •Itahs disclaim nlit abont our J limit as they a d is Europeans u a laities as the I ahoi just as wel s Hey know the ( id*, for the pol: die Dutch in , a m favour of 1 h! io matter wl r. other Colonh Mi Sir, in the ^wopise th % outposts ^Sraltar of the ■ '4 have a grieON INDIAN CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM 9 20° Novembris, 1933.] Memorandum by Sir Phiroze [Contin/ned c. Sethna, O.B.E., ON THE Future Constitution oe Aden. is sent from there to Ai abian, African and even Iraq provinces. My point therefore is that if Indians leave Aden as they are bound to, this large trade will be lost to India. You may naturally inquire, why’should not any other traders take their place? I say they will not. Indians conduct their business on different lines. Those who come in their place will not do the business on a credit basis same as the Indians do. “Our fifth objection is that, if Aden is not included in India and is transferred to the Colonial Office, then, because Aden salt pays only excise duty and not protective duty when it comes to India, the salt industry in Aden is bound to be crushed out of existence. These factories will be closed down and the lakhs sunk in them be lost, but what is of great importance, and which I would ask Government to bear in mind, is that out of Aden’s population of over 50,000, there are 2,500 Arabs who work in the four salt factories there and this large number will be without employment. Sir, I can easily multiply these reasons for objecting to the proposed transfer, but I will not take up any more time of the Council. I will now just biiefly refer to one objection in connection with my original Resolution of 1921 raised by Sir Denys Bray. He expressed the fear at that date that the Arabs and Jews were siding with the Indians but how long would the Arabs do so? He thought that as soon as the Arabs are educated, they would not join forces with the Indians. The long period of 12 years has elapsed since then. The Arabs have not wavered in their affection and in their regard and sympathy with Indians and for good reasons they as well as the Jews prefer to act in concert with them. They know that the presence of Indians help them and therefore there is no talk and no fear of their not helping the Indians. I know when I was in London some months ago much capital was made of a small petition signed by 32 people and sent to the Viceroy through the Chief Commis sioner of Aden. That was a petition signed not by pure Adenites but by 32 Arabs who came from the hinterland. As soon as it was discovered that such a representation had been sent, the regular Arab traders got together and within a few days sent another representation signed not by 32 Arabs but by 500 Arabs disclaiming what was said by the 32. “And what about our Jewish friends? The Jews in Aden are not Jews from the Levant as they are in South Africa, and where they are favoured and treated as Europeans. The Jews in Aden are Baghdadi Jews, and as much Asiatics as the Indians or the Arabs there. Both the Arabs and the Jews know just as well as we do of the Colonial policy to which I have referred. They know the Colonial policy of European powers. It is not the British alone, for the policy of Italians in Mussowah and Italian Somali land or of the Dutch in Java and Africa. In Java is just the same dis crimination in favour of the white man against the Asiatic. We full well realise that no matter what professions or promises are made to-day they are bound to be broken. The Home Government must create some excuse or other to meet the wishes of Europeans in other parts of the Empire to see that no favour is extended to Asiatics in Aden which is not extended to them in other Colonies. “ I said, Sir, in the earlier part of my speech that the political and military administration is already taken away from the Government of India. We recognise that the British Empire is great and that it must have military outposts both near and far. Aden may well be regarded as the Gibraltar of the East so far as the British Empire is concerned. We certainly have a grievance that the transfer of the political and military; IliD^ RECORDS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE 20° Novembris, 1933.] Memorandum by Sir Phiroze [Continued. C. Sethna, O.B.E., on the Future Constitution of Aden. Med £o&amp;’ 05 administration was made without our consent and without our knowledge hut India is a member of the great British Empire and for that reason we no longer press for the return to this country of what is already transferred in the way of the political and military administration. So far as tke civil administration is concerned we protest and protest most stoutly for the reasons I have endeavoured to place before the Council. “ I do hope, Sir, that Government will accede to our wishes and keep the civil administration with the Government of India or if necessary with the Government of Bombay. It is one thing for Government to ask for our opinion and quite another if Government do not give heed to that opinion. We do hope that the Leader of the House will give us an assur ance that if the view held by the Legislature is against the transfer that Government will consider itself bound to respect the wishes of the Legisla ture and their wishes are what is practically desired by the country at large.” Several members followed and I quote a pertinent extract from the speech of the Honourable Mr. B. K. Basu. It is as follows: — “Sir, the real excuse that I have for intervening in this debate is that I am suffering, from some intellectual tortures ever since I read this communique. First, as was very ably traversed by Sir Phiroze Sethna, I find the words ‘ geographically remote ’ giving me one of those tortures because when I find that we have places under the administration of the Government of India which are more or less, shall I say fortunately or unfortunately, placed in the same position as Aden. Take, for example, the island of Andamans. It is in the very same inconvenient or convenient geographical position. Geo graphically, the Andamans is nearer to Ceylon than to India. Why does not the Colonial Government say, ‘ Give us the Andamans?’ We will be glad to make a present of it to them; we would not stand in their way. Secondly, the commmnique says that Aden will not naturally fit into the new federation. Here again the question tortures me. How can the Andamans be fitted into the federation, and if the Andamans can be fitted into the contemplated Indian federation why cannot Aden be fitted in; it is not very difficult; if you can fit in the one, you can fit in the other.” Government members did not vote. The non-official members both elected and nominated, supported the motion and it was adopted. On 16th September, 1933, Sir Joseph Bhore, the Leader of the House in the Legislative Assembly, also moved, “ That the Government of India communique, dated 20th June, 1933, regarding the future administration of Aden be taken into consideration.” There were several amendments on the Order Paper. The discussion did not end on that day and was re sumed on 18th September, 1933, when the following substituted motion was adopted, Government members not voting: — “ While recording their emphatic protest against the complete transfer to the Colonial Office of Aden Settlement which has for about a century been an integral part of British Indian administration, the Assembly requests the Governor-General in Council to convey to His Majesty’s Government the strong desire of the people of India that the proposed transfer should not take place.” Since the passing of the above two resolutions in the two Houses of the Indian Legislature, there have been more meetings held in Aden protesting against the proposed transfer.

The Press communique of 20th June, 1933, was as follows- — His Majesty’s Government have recently received representations from different communities among the inhabitants of Aden as well a s from certain quarters in India expressing their various views in regard to the transfer „f the atom,stKat.on ot Aden from the control of the GotmrnLnt „f Jnlia to His Majesty s Government. The matter is one which is now receiving the consideration of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India in connection with the impending constitutional changes Full onnor tunity will be given for discussion in the India Legislative Chambers at heir next session and for all the interests concerned to state their views Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government think that it would be convenient that the considerations which suggest the desirability of a transfer of the administration and the conditions that would be entailed by such a transfer should be made known so that the problem can be discussed with a full knowledge of the facts. The reasons which suggest that Aden should not remain linked with India ,under the new constitution are, that it is an area geographically remote from India; that it would not naturally fit into the new federation- that it is already to some extent under Imperial control, and that it is in separable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of Indian control. If it should be decided that the adminis tration of Aden should be separated from that of India, His Majesty’s Government contemplate that the following conditions would be estab lished : — (1) India would be relieved of the annual contribution of approxi mately £150,000 sterling, or Its. 20 lakhs, at present payable towards the military and political administration. (2) The right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court would be maintained. (3) His Majesty’s Government woiuld maintain the existing policy of making Aden a free port unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place. From their own point of view the abandonment of this policy would clearly in existing economic con ditions be financially unsound, since the prosperity of Aden depends largely on its transit trade. (4) His Majesty’s Government would do their utmost to maintain the present standard of administration and would not impose any additional taxation unless such a course became, in their opinion, absolutely necessary. (5) A proportion of Indian service administrative personnel wd»uld be the trading communities of the places who are mainly fndiaus AroK j J ews.

I desire to make it clear at the outset that the note which follows expresses views about the future of Aden which I wish to lay before my colleagues of the Joint Committee at this stage for their consideration. The nature of the recommendations to be made to Parliament is a matter for the decision of the Joint Committee, and that decision cannot, of course, be compromised in any way by anything I say now. ;«! measure. &gt;— ibi History. 2. Aden has been an important entrepot of trade since early times—at any rate since the early centuries of Islam. In 1513 it was attacked unsuccessfully by Albuquerque. In 1538 it was acquired by the Turks as a base of operations against the Portuguese, and belonged to them until 1630. Subsequently it was possessed by various Arab Chiefs until 1839, when it was captured by the British with a force of 300 European and 400 Indian troops. The occasion of its capture was an outrage on the passengers and crew of a British buggalow wrecked in the neighbourhood. The East India Company, however, had already in 1829 contemplated making it a coaling station, but at that time had abandoned the idea, owing to the difficulty of procuring labour. Perim, which now forms part of the Aden Settlement had been occupied by the British in 1799 as a precaution against the possible descent of Napoleon on India, but was subsequently abandoned till 1857, when it was reoccupied. . . , It will thus be seen (a) that Aden has always been a place of general strategic importance, and (b) that it has been for centuries an Arab town. Population. 3. The population of the Aden Settlement (excluding Perim, which has a population of 1,700) at the 1931 census was as follows: — Arabs ... 29 ’ 820 ™ Indians Jews Somalis Europeans Miscellaneous Total 7,287 4,120 3,935 1,145 331 Thus about 64 per cent, of the population is Arab as against about lo per cent. Indian. The total area of the Settlement is 75 square miles and ot Perim five square miles. Hecent history of question of transfer. 4. Speeches delivered in the debates in the Indian Council of^ State on 31st August and in the Legislative Assembly on 16th and 18th September, 1933 referred to the history of the various recent steps taken m regar o Aden. Some of these speeches seem to indicate that there is a mistaken impression that His Majesty’s Government have led up to the presen proposal by a series of faits accomplis. In order to correct an} impressions, it may be desirable to summarise the recent history ot the question and the present position.

[Continued. (i) The political and military administration of Aden ha* trolled by H.s Majeety-s Government since 1917, when waTtaken by a Cabinet decision of ^Decembert ^2 f ba™ finandaHy ^ more favourable to India than previous proposals made by the Co onial Office; the evil (re internal municipal) administration of the Settle' meat was eft with India, and the political control (i e sole resnon i bihty for the Protectorate) and military control with His Majesty's Govi ernment, who took over the military and politioal charges with the aid of an annual contribution from Indian revenues (of £250 000 a vear for the first three years, and after that one-third of the total annual cost subject to a maximum of £160,000 a year). India’s present liability under this head is about £120,000, but as Sir George Schuster pointed out in the Assembly, it might at any time rise to £150 000 Pledo-es have been given by the Government of India from time to time that the civil administration will not be transferred to His Majesty’s Government without the Legislature and the interests concerned being given an opportunity of expressing their views. In 1931 it was decided as a measure of administrative convenience, to transfer the administration from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India and this transfer was made with effect from 1st April, 1932. In November 1931, Lord Wilhngdon and Sir E. Howell (then Foreign Secretary to the Government of India) stated to a deputation that this change did not affect the question of transfer to the Colonial Office and was not a step towards any other change. That statement was correct; the decision taken in 1931 was taken simply as a matter of administrative convenience; and if it had not been taken, the constitutional question which has now arisen would have had to be considered none the less. (ii) Until progress had been made with consideration of the present proposals for^ Indian constitutional reform, no question arose of revis ing the decision of 1926 regarding Aden. But as the proposals for an Indian Federation with responsibility at the centre took clearer shape, it became obvious that the question of Aden would have again to be considered with a view to deciding whether the continuance of the existing arrangements would be practicable if the Government of India were converted into a Federal Government. Hence the statement in the White Paper that the future arrangements for the Aden Settle ment are under consideration. On 30th (May I received a deputation led by His Highness the Aga Khan, of which 'Sir P. Sethna was spokes man. I noted the views of the deputation and gave them the assurance that no decision would be taken 'before discussion in the Indian Legisla ture, and furthermore that, whatever the decision might be, every care would be taken to safeguard existing interests so far as it lay in the power of His Majesty’s Government to do so. At the same time I suggested to the deputation, as matter for reflection, the diffi culties of fitting Aden into the proposed Indian Federation. (iii) Subsequently, in order that the question might be discussed by the Legislature and considered by the interests concerned with a full knowledge of the facts, His Majesty’s Government authorised the state ment published on 19th June (appended to this memorandum and issued m India as the communique of 20th June, which is appended to Sir P. Sethna’s memorandum), stating the considerations which suggest theRECOEDS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE 20° Novembris , 1933.] Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India. [Continued. desirability of the transfer of Aden and the conditions and assurances which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give if transfer takes place. Since then opportunity has been given, as promised, for full discussion in both Chambers of the Indian Legislature, and steps have been taken to elicit the wishes of the Arab population of Aden itself. (iv) Thus we now have available all the material required for a full consideration of the question. For my own part I have carefully studied the debates in the Legislature and need hardly say that I attach great weight to the views expressed therein, but I have also had to consider most anxiously the whole question in the light of all the facts, the various and extensive interests involved, and the views expressed in various quarters. Difficulty of placing civil administration under Indian Federal Government. 5 The debates in the Indian Legislature indicate that the true nature of the difficulties of fitting Aden into the proposed Indian Federation may not have been fully appreciated. The only difficulty mentioned in the debates was the fact that Aden is now a Chief Commissioner’s Province directly under the Government of India, and members naturally asked why this difficulty could not be met by retlurning Aden to the Government of Bombay and making it again part of the Bombay Presidency. It is therefore desirable that I should explain more fully the underlying reasons for the assertions in my statement of 19th June, that Aden “ would not naturally fit into the new Federation, that it is already to some extent under Imperial control and that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of Indian control.” They are as follows. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make a clean sepa ration between the Arab town of Aden and its Arab hinterland, the Aden Protectorate. Similarly, it would be impracticable to effect a complete divorce between the civil administration of the Settlement on the one hand and the political and military control of the Protectorate on the other. For manv prarposes the whole area forms a single whole. At present there is a condominium, the civil administration of the Settlement being controlled from Delhi the political control of the Protectorate and the defence of both being’placed directly under His Majesty’s Government. Naturally there are very great practical difficulties involved in a condominium of this character. The only reason why it works efficiently in practice at all is that in the last resort the decision of all questions arising vests in His Majesty’s Government. This is so because the Government of India under its present constitution is in the last resort subordinate to His Majesty s Government. But when the Government of India becomes a Government in which responsibility for the civil administration of Chief Commissioners Provinces rests upon Ministers, the position will be entirely different and the division of control, which is just workable at present, would become entirely unworkable. This objection would not be removed, but on the con trary would if anything be strengthened, if Aden were made a part of a Governor’s Province under the new constitution. Furthermore, for defence purposes it is obviously impossible to make a distinction between the Fro- tectorate and the Settlement, and it is therefore essential that the defence of the latter as well as of the former should continue to be a direct re sponsibility of His Majesty’s Government. But a continuance of tne present system, whereby defence vests in His Majesty’s Government in respect of the Settlement as well as of the Protectorate, would become con 5 Empire in ^ a!

Such a constitutional anomaly would be removed bv the retransfer of military control to India but this solution is ruled out bv the requirements of Imperial Defence. ^ Imperial Interests. 6. The strategic^ position of Aden, and its importance from this point of view to the Empire in the East generally and not merely to any sino-l e Empire unit, is a strong argument for control by the Home Government This by itself might be viewed as a decisive objection to the retention of the existing condominium when once the new constitution is established in India. Aden, in fact, besides its importance to the Empire as a refuelling station, is of greater general strategic importance to Imperial communica tions and to the Empire as a whole than to India by itself; moreover Aden (Settlement plus Protectorate, which for this purpose are a’n integral ’whole) is of political importance with regard to Arabia. ' Arab Interests. 7. One of the most important factors to be considered is the interests of the Arab majority of the Aden population. In the Indian Legislature reference was made to resolutions against transfer purporting to represent the views of the Arabs as well as of the Indians. Hut since the publication of my statement of 19th June, the object of which was to elicit Arab as well as Indian opinion, I have been at pains to obtain from the Chief Com missioner a report on the real wishes of the Arabs. The Chief Commissioner reports that the Arab community are as a whole satisfied with the existing state of affairs (i.e., with an administration controlled through the Gov ernment of India by His Majesty’s Government), but that they view wuth grave misgivings the possibility that the Government of Aden may become Indianised as the result of constitutional changes in India, and fear the subordination of Arab to Indian interests; and (since a continuance of the present state of affairs would in any case be made impossible by the forth coming Indian Reforms) they would on the whole prefer that the adminis tration of Aden should henceforth be controlled by His Majesty’s Govern ment direct. ID i Etly in rowj ins aniiiiifis| Fear of racial discrimination. 8. One of the fears expressed in the Indian Legislature was that Sunder Crown Colony Government Indians would sniffer from racial discrimination. This is really answered by the categorical assurance wRich I gave on I9th June that, as one of the conditions of transfer, “No racial legislation or segregation would be permitted by His Majesty’s Government.” There is no parallel at all between the situation in Aden and that in Kenya which has been referred to in the debates in the Indian Legislature. Financial effect of transfer. useierfC .9; In the Council of State debate, Sir P. Sethna suggested that, if the Purtlergifki administration of Aden is transferred, India would lose Rs. 10 lakhs itinction revenue from salt, income tax and super-tax, to set off against the saving eiseDtiai®'-' 0U ^ le military contribution. This point was dealt with by Sir G. Schuster m .^ le legislative Assembly.

The actual figures of civil revenue and expenditure for the years from 1927-28 to 1933-34 are as follows: — Years. 1927- 28 1928- 29 1929- 30 1930- 31 1931- 32 1932- 33 (revised) 1933- 34 (budget) Bevenue.

For the year 1932-33 there was a comparatively large surplus of Its. 2.62 lakhs, due to the rise in income tax receipts in Aden in that year. There was a small and precarious surplus /in 1931-32 of Rs. 0.65 lakhs and in 1933-34 (budget estimate) of Rs. 0.86 lakhs due to retrenchments. The only qualification of the statement that an approxi mately even balance would be handed over is that some part of the income tax paid in India in respect of Aden may be lost under the provisions for relief from double income tax; the Government of India are naturally unable to give any exact estimate of this figure, but say that they may have to lose a lakh or two. Effect of transfer on trade. 10. It has also been suggested that if Aden is transferred, Indian trade would be lost and Indian merchants would leave and that this has been the result of the transfer of Somaliland to the Colonial Office in 1905. (Prior to that date Somaliland was administered by the Resident at Aden from 1884 to 1898, and by the Foreign Office from 1898 to 1905.) It is stated that traders (Indians, Jews and Arabs) have left the Somaliland ports owing to high taxation resulting from costly administration. However this may be, there is, as a matter of fact, no basis for the comparison between Aden and Somaliland. I understand that a reason why the Somaliland ports have decreased in prosperity is the difficulty in that country of levying direct taxation, owing to the unruly character of the inhabitants, with the consequence that the administration is the more dependent on import duties. But the position at Aden is exactly the reverse, as Aden is a free port and the cost of the administration is met by direct taxation. Effect of transfer on Aden salt. 11. Indian salt firms at Aden fear that their interests would be adversely affected by transfer. The position is that salt made in Aden is at present exempt from the additional import duty in India imposed by the Salt (Additional Import Duty) Act of 1931, as amended in 1933, and accord ingly shares with salt made in India the advantage of a preference over other “ foreign ” salt. Under the operation of the Act of 1931 this prefer ence was 4J annas per maund, but by the Act of 1933 it has been reduced to 2^ annas per maund. If Aden ceased to be part of India and no concession were made to Aden salt, it would lose this preference.

If Aden is’ separated it will be for the Indian Legislature of the future to decide what terms should be accorded to salt from Aden.

Misunderstanding of the assurances in the statement of ISth June. !2. The conditions contemplated by His Majesty’s Government in the statement of 19th June m the event of transfer are in my view -onerous and ought to meet any reasonable apprehensions on the part of the Indian interests concerned. The speeches in the Legislature showed that there are certain misunderstandings as to the meaning of these conditions Those regarding the contribution and the promise that there would be no racial discrimination have been dealt with above. Assurance No 2 that a right of appeal would continue to lie to the Bombay High Court, has been included among the assurances in the interests of Aden litigants 4n undue amount of attention has, I think, been directed to the qualified form of assurances 3 (maintenance of the free port) and 4 (maintenance of the present standard of administration without imposing additional taxa tion). As regards 3, I would emphasise, what is stated in the assurance, that from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government themselves the abandonment of the policy of a free port would clearly in existing economic conditions be financially unsound, since the prosperity of Aden depends largely on its transit trade. The assurance that the policy would be main tained was only qualified by the words &lt;l unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place.” I think that critics of this qualification may have overlooked the word “ radical.” Assurance No. 4 “not to impose any additional taxation ” was qualified by the words “ unless such a course became, in His Majesty’s Government’s opinion, absolutely necessary.” This is an obviously necessary qualification, as His Majesty’s Government could not bind themselves in such a matter for ever. The wording of assurance No. 5, “ A proportion of Indian service adminis trative personnel would be retained in Aden service for some years after transfer took place,” has been misunderstood. The meaning was that a proportion of the administrative personnel at Aden would continue to tepad to the Indian Service for some years. In the Indian Legislature it has been interpreted to mean that only a proportion of the Indians at present serving among the administrative personnel would be retained for some years, and that the remainder would be sent away. In order to make more explicit the meaning of this assurance, I may say that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give an assurance that, in the event of the transfer of Aden, all Indian administrative personnel serving in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on the terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent; when vacancies occurred, Indians would remain eligible for appointment (though there would be a gradual substitution of Colonial Service officers); it would be understood that all newcomers to the Aden Service would be appointed on definite terms to be agreed upon in each case, and would have no claim to Indian conditions of service, unless these w T ere specially imported into their agreements or letters of appointment.(19366-60) Wt. 1141—379 1000 P.

His Majesty’s Government are also prepared to give a specific additional assurance that in the event of transfer Indian British subjects would be allowed to enter the Protectorate under precisely the same con ditions as any other British subjects. APPENDIX. Statement in answer to a question by Mr. David Grenfell in the House of Commons, Dated 19th June, 1933. Sir S. Hoare : His Majesty’s Government have recently received repre sentations from different communities among the inhabitants of Aden as well as from certain quarters in India, expressing their various views in regard to the transfer of the administration of Aden from the control of the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government. The matter is one which is now receiving the consideration of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India in connection with the impending constitutional changes. Full opportunity will be given for discussion in the Indian legis lative Chambers at their next session and for all the interests concerned to state their views. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government think that it would be convenient that the considerations which suggest the desirability of a transfer of the administration and the conditions that would be entailed by such a transfer should be made known so that the problem can be discussed with a full knowledge of the facts. The reasons which suggest that Aden shomld not remain linked with India under the new constitution are, that it is an area geographically remote from India; that it would not naturally fit into the new federation; that it is already to some extent under Imperial control, and that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of Indian control. If it should be decided that the adminis tration of Aden should he separated from that of India, His Majesty’s Government contemplate that the following conditions would be estab lished : — (1) India would be relieved of the annual contriblution of approxi mately £150,000 sterling, or Rs. 20 lakhs, at present payable towards the military and political administration. (2) The right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court would be maintained. (3) His Majesty’s Government would maintain the existing policy of making Aden a free port unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place. From their own point of view the abandonment of this policy would clearly in existing economic con ditions be financially unsound, since the prosperity of Aden depends largely on its transit trade. _ _ A (4) His Majesty’s Government womld do their utmost to maintain the present standard of administration and would not impose any additional taxation unless such a course became, in their opinion, absolutely necessary. .2 (5) A proportion of Indian service administrative personnel would be retained in Aden service for some years after transfer took place. (6) No racial legislation or segregation would be permitted by His Majesty’s Government.Sir V.

Perhaps this might be done by means of a confidential memo, on the lines of the attached draft. Presumably the Committee would take note of it, and make a recommendation regarding Aden in their report. telegrams as they stand, with some such explanation as is contained m the covering memo. The S. of S.'s telegram, of 30th Oct., being addressed to the G. of I., expressed his view somewhat more positively than was done m the memo, submitted to the J.S.C. on 20th hovr.

Mr •Walton, I a^ree that it would probably be best to communicate the correspondence as it stands and without editing to the Joint Committee. The memorandum to which it would be attached would, in the first instance, be confidential and would not be published unless the Committee so directed. No doubt the Committee would readily respond to any suggestion of the Secretary of State that it should not be published. I suggest, however, for consideration, the addition of a short paragraph to the memorandum in some such terms as follow '1 have thought it best to furnish my colleagues with the telegrams attached in full in the form in which they passed between the G-overnment of India and myself/inysexi. oauuia tne committee tliink it desirable, in making any recommendation on tiie subject in their Report, to quote this correspondence, I would ask that I should be given an opportunity of considering whether any omissions or modi! ications are necessary, since the telegrams were obviously not drafted with an eye to their publication. 7 ’ The suggested addition has been made to the draft memo As para. 6 of the G. of I.'s telegram refers to a discussion of the salt question contained m a letter irorn them of 13th T? eby., the relevant extract from that letter might also be communicated to the Committee as Appendix C.

Para. 7 of that memo, dealt with the factor of Arab interests m the consideration of the question of separating Aden from India. I now circulate for the information of the CXr^~ . Joint Committee a-most important letter fi J* which hac bocyr received since that date A A from the Chief Commissioner, forwarding a translation of a representation received by him from Arab signatories who, he states, include nearly all the nnncipal Arabs in the town of Aden. The desire expressed in this representation for the transfe^^i Aden to C.O. administration seems to mt/, ii greatly to reinforce the arguments which have already been suggested m favour of separation. I also bring to the notice of my colleagues the attached telegraphic correspondence/with the n. of !•&gt; m which they state their views on the question/ 12262 5000 1 1.333/ Draft Paper. ■ Department. -262 5000 11.33 : ( l aestion of transfer. It will be seen ! frorn their telegram of 12th Oct. that the ; majority of the Viceroy's Council, when j they considered the question in the IL ht of the debates in the Indian Legislature m August and September last, were opposed to transfer. I felt that 01 1 not fully appreciated tne arguments on the other side, and therefore sent them a telegram on 30th °ct. setting out the reasons as they appear to me ior taking the present opportunity of transferring Aden who ny to Imperial control. The natter was then again considered by the G. of I. It will be seen from their telegram of 17th hov. that some of the Viceroy's Council adhere to their first views on the matter, in view -e-g local sentiment^ m favour of the retention of Aden by India. On the other hand, others of the Viceroy’s Council, including the C. m C., who had not been present when the question was first discussed, have placed on record their emphatic agreement with the arguments m favour of transfer which I have already suggested to the Committee. Sir B.L. Hitter, the Lav; Member of the Viceroy’s Council, is also m favour of transfer. With reference to the point which heDepartment. makes in regard to safeguarding Indians against discrimination of any sort, I may mention that I have ascertained from the ; C.G. that they can certainly give art assurance that m the event of transfer there will be no racial discrimination, either m legislation or m admin i strati or u gainst Indian British subjects m Aden. It will be seen that the G. of I. raving, as they were bound to do, set out the local considerations in India m regard uo the f|uestion of transfer, if are consent to leave^ to the authorities m this country to weigh these considerations against the imperial interests involved (many of which the G. of I. recognise to be beyond their own purview) and to arrive at a final decision in the matter. For my part,while I recognise that the views held by the members of the G. of I. on both sides of the question are entitled to serious consideration, I see no reason to modify the views winch I tentatively placed before the Committee in my memo, of 20th Nov., as I feel that any ill- effect) that a decision to transfer Aden may have on Indian sentiment is more than counterbalanced by the imperial and other advantages of such a step. I have thought it best to furnishry colleagues with the telegrams attached in full in the form m v/hich they passed between the G. of I. and myself. Should the Committee think it desirable, in- • making any recommendation on the.subject in their Report, to quote this correspondence, I would ask that I should be given an opportunity of considering v/hether any omissions or modifications are necessary, since the telegrams were obviously not drafted with an eye to their publication.A +5i ^Qiiy-ident ial .

As stated in my telegram the signatories include nearly all the principal Arabs in the town. They are anxious that their views may be clearly represented before the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee which is considering the White Paper on Indian constitutional Reforms, They are opposed to the inclusion of Aden within the new Indian Constitution, and, as stated in their representation, they desire its transfer to Colonial Office administration. 3. The racial composition of the population of Aden is as follows: - European 1,145 Arabs 29,820 Indians 7,287 Jews 4,120 Somalis 3,935 Miscellaneous ... 331 It will be seen that the Arabs form over 60 per cent of the population, and are by far the largest individual community, and I trust that adequate consideration will be given to the opinion which their leading men have now expressed in a rather more definite form than hitherto.Translation of a representation in Arabic dated 23rd ^November 1933 from certain Arabs.

That the rights and interests of the Arabs be maintained by appointing an adequate number of them in proportion to their numbers in the town as members of both the local Settlement and Port Trust Boards. 7. That an advisory council to the Governor be established, on which the number of members representing the Arabs should be in proportion to the number of Arabs in the town.

In light of apprehensions expressed in debate I have now secured however specific additional assurence from Colonial Office that in event of transfer Indian British subjects would be allowed to enter Protectorate under precisely seme conditions as any ouher British subjects. 5. Colonial Office are further prepared to give assurance that all Indian administrative perscnnei setting in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on termsos Service under which they *ere then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent. When vacancies occurred(though there would be gradual substitution of Colonial Service officers) Indians would remain eligible for appointment though on definite terns to be agreed in each case and on basis of Indian conditions of service only if these were specially imported into their agreements or letters of appointment. 6. On two further points arising out of debate I should like to add (a) that parallel with Somaliland drawn by Sethna was quite misleading. Somaliland ports have gone down because of inability of local administration, owing to unruly character of inhabitants,, to levy any direct taxation with the result that adninistration depends entirely on import duties. Position at Aden is exactly the reverse as Aden is a free port and cost of administration is met by direct taxation. (bv Prominence of Salt question is understandable c . But this is essentially a matter for the Indian Legislature, having regard to the Fiscal Convention. In view of solicitude shown in debate for commercial and other interests of Indians at Aden, Legislature may possibly be responsive to any appeal made by Sethna and his friends on behalf of Aden salt manufacturers when question arises. 7. I v/ill endeavour to take an opportunity in inrnediete future either in the Joint Committee or in discussion with Sethna and his friends to explain reasons for transfer and comprehensive character of assurances, and so to redress balance and emphasise true position,, Meanwhile I ^iall be glad if you will urgently consider matter further, and let me have your observations by telegraph as early as possible.Downing Street, 24tli Oototisr, 1933.

(aic) Aden. 2, Having regard to the views expressed by all sections ox Indian opinion in recent debates in the Assembly and Council of State, we strongly urge that when the future of Aden is considered,., strength of genuine Indian sentiment in favour of retaining it as part of British India should be recognised, This sentiment can be met by maintaining broad features of the present arrangements under which the defence oi Aden and relations with adjoining protectorate are a responsibilty of His Majesty's Government, while the civil administration alone is concern of the Government of India, vVe see no serious difficulty in carrying forward these arrangements into the new constitution:. Civil administration would, as now, be entrusted to Chief Commissioner as officer subordinate to the federal Government, but subject to convention that the officer appointed by Hlis Majesty r, s Government to hold charge of the protectorate and political relations with the interior would automatically be appointed Chief Commissioner by the federal Government. We trust that His Majesty * a Government may see their way to accept the arrange- ment on these lines, which would leave them free to protect themselves in any way, both as regards the defence of AdenSo and its use as strategic point. So little is involYed in the c-LYil administration of the town of Aden, that it would seem politically most undesirable simply, for the purpose of e-Liecting its transfer from the future federal Government P to embiutei Indian feeling in a matter in which practical issues are of such minor importance 0 paragraph.Wt would draw particular attention to this aspect of the case* It may perhaps be necessary at some future date for Hie Majesty 0 s Government to assume ci.v'kl control of Aden* but to.- do so now would we feel be most unfortunate© We are at present preparing to nanct over to India a large measure of control of her own ai.Aairs and* in so doing* are demonstrating our trust ln her future willingness to maintain the Imperial connection* If* at the same time, we take from her small measure of control she still exercises over the one Imperial link with which she is directly connected* we shall Incur the obvious criticism that our prof essions of trust are meaningless and that we do not believe either in her power or will to remain within the Empire* Such action on our part will* we feel., engender widespread resentment in India and will undoubtedly be a most unfortunate precursor to the Introduction of the new constitution* 3© His Excellency the Viceroy* who was absent in Assam when the above opinion was formulated* concursr.oncurg in these views which represent those of the majority of his Council* 4* Should Hie Majesty's Government approve of these proposals, we will consider in detail the question of including Aden in our proposals for the Chief Commissioner’s provinces in the new Constitution*P.Z. 1027/33 Extract from letter from Government of India, Finance Department, dated 13th February 1933, C.No. 55-G1/33. 5. Once Aden is separated, Indian interest in it will be confined to safeguarding the interests of Indians in Aden in the same manner as those of any Indian community overseas, and the question of assisting any important local industry, whether owned by Indians or others, in any way will be a matter for the Government that has taken over the administration of Aden. It is, however, desirable that His Majesty’s Government should at this stage appreciate the fact that a demand for compensation or assistance in some form is almost certain t o be made. 6. It seems to the Government of India to be impossible to suggest that the Indian revenues could undertake any sort of responsibility in this connection, although the Government of India cannot at the stage of separation refrain from drawing the attention of His Majesty’s Government to the effect of the change upon the interests of these salt works. It also seems impossible to contemplate imposing upon the Indian Government and Legislature of the future any obligation to maintain for a separated Aden the benefits that Aden at present enjoys fran the operation of the Salt (Additional Import Duty) Act. It would in any case be improper to tie the hands of the future Government in a, matter of tariff policy to this extent; and there is, moreover, the special consideration, as the Secretary of State is aware, that owners of salt works on the mainland of India have been making earnest endeavours, and will certainly continue to make them, to induce the Government and the Legislatureof India to exclude Aden even while it remains pol observation does not prec Indian Government and Leg special treatment to Aden have to be voluntary and A pranise of the concessi terms of separation and, consent to such a concess responsible for the admin assistance, if any, can b frcm the benefits of protection, itically a part of India. This lude the possibility that the islature of the future might accord salt; but such a concession would terminable at the will of India, on cannot be made as one of the if the future Legislature does not ion, it will be for the Government istration of Aden to consider what e given to the industry.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000015_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1485</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000015</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1485</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 1/49 'Aden.
