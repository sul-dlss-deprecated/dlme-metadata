In the case of a Governor, the contract grant covers, besides the maintenance of motorcars, the wages, allowances and liveries of household servants, special stationery, coal and fire wood and household sundries such as soap, cleaning materials etc* Koweit Agency’s contract grant probably covers the household servants etc. as well as the salaries of the subordinate clerks.

Your excellency will also appreciate that the directions now given must remain open to r^coribiderotion in the light of experience. nf Yoh d f oi l dj in accordance with the recommendations oi Your excellency s Government, and in supersession of the Sth^rrn S l Q^? mU ?i C + twd in Financia l Despatch No.13, dated the th h + + at previous consent shall be sought upon ' foll0v ' / ing matters to the extent indicated against cach:- (i) (ii ) ■xpundituro in respect of the Governor-General's staff pnd household, the residences, furniture and motor cars provided for his use, his equipment and travelling allowances, his sumptuary allowance, and his contract allowance, shall be regulated by such requirements as have been or may be- made in this regard by the Secretary cf State. Expenditure in respect of Diplomatic end Consular services in Iran and the Persian Gulf shall be t0 thc P^vious sanction of the Secretary otdte except in the following casesj— (a) fio-sh expenditure on salaries up to an amount not exceeding £100 per annum in the aggregate '■ any one Consulate: at(b) increased expenditure on contingencies, except as regards an unusual item exceeding £100; (c) increased expenditure on travelling.

(iii) Expenditure on the purchase of imported military stores shall bo subject to suen rules as have been or may be made in this regard by the Secretary of State, and no purchases not covered by such rules shall be made without his prior consent. (iv) The consent of the Secretary of State shall be obtained before any dispute arising out of the terms of a contract executed in England with a Railway Company of English domicile is referred to arbitration. 4. Apart from these specific limitations, the question whether a prior reference should be made to the Secretary of State will in future depend upon the judgment of Your Excellency's Government. As Your excellency is well aware, a similar discreticn is already exercisable over the whole range of Government activity except in so far as reference to me has been specifically required by the rules hitherto in force on the subject of prior sanction to expenditure, and the conventions governing its exercise are familiar. In broad terms, prior reference to the Secretary of State will be required either if the nature of the proposed action, or the circumstances in which it is to be taken are such as to occasion doubt whether the Secretary of State l may not find reason to question its suitability; cr_ (even in cases where no such doubt is felt) if warranted by the intrinsic importance or general interest of the matter or by the degree of criticism which is likely to be aroused in Parliament, in the Indian Legislatures, or elsewhere. These criteria should in future be applied over the whole financial field. I do not propose to attempt to suggest in any detail how they should be applied, though I would particularly instance, as an example of the occasions upon which doubt might arise, the case of an important unresolved difference of opinion between the Finance Department and another Department. I prefer in general to rely ^5n the discretion of Your Excellency's Government, confident that it will always be exercised with a full sense of the ultimate responsibility to Parliament which the Secretary of Sts&gt;to must continue to bear for all the operations of Your Excellency's Government. I have the honour to be My Lord Marcuess, Your Lordship's most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) ZETLAND.Secretary, Financial Department Please see the letter belpw from the Government of India on the subject of x ari increase in the contract grant of the ''weit Agency, which refers to Financial L-epartment's letter No.F.2114/3^ (flagged p in the attached file). It is proposed to forward the Government of Indian letter to the Foreign Office with the request that (they will obtain Treasury sanction for the amount payable by H.M.G. unless you consider that the case is covered by the decision at F.1024-8/4-2. We do not appear to have any papers in this Department relevant to the ''contract grant”. (Sgd.) M. Odgers. The Government of India seem to have misread the last sentence but one of the second paragraph of your Departments letter of 13th August, 193&amp; at F.2114/36. It seems clear that the intention of this was that probable excesses (beyond the permissible limit of overdraft) in any individual grant should be submitted for sanction to the Government of India; but that it would be necessary to seek the sanction of the Secretary of State only when the excess on all thei 2 office allowances where expenditure is divisible exceeded the permissible limit (see also the last sub-paragraph of (l) of Mr. Taylor's minute of July 23, 1936). Under this rule the G-ovemment of India can themselves sanction this small increase in the Koweit contract gr and reference -to the Secretary of Staue is unnecessary. • - If you agree with the above, we will reply to the Government of India accordingly. . . /^ &gt; H0.123-A/42. r ‘ L. ^ From \ \Ttte Secretary to the Goverment of India ^ ) to the External Affairs Department, &gt;v Jgj-^nder Secretary of State for India, iP India Of fice, London.

Eadi Government mans and initially x«y» for certain consulates and each is under an obligation to obtain the consent of *he other to ary fresh expenditure of more than £100 a year on ary oonsulate in its Jurisdiction. This is of course all very fine and ^ar^e in nomal tines, but it seems to me in present odrcisnstances vh^it we might very u-ell consider raising this' limit to something a little more reasonable. I have, for instance. Just had put before me a long reference from a consul at one of the Foreign Office consulates regarding an increase in the cost-of-living allowance for the subordinate staff of the consulate. An elaborate Cctse h^.s been made out which has been supported by Tehran to the Foreign Office who have cut it to tne Treasury and to us for concurrence. We should normally refer it to the Government of India and if they agreed to bear their half-share we should report their concurrence to the Foreign Office, who (if the Treasury also agreed) vrould then notify the consul that his proposals had been approved. The total amount involved in all this elaborate correspondence is some ,€230 a year which is to be divided equally between the two Goverraaents. It does seem to me that in rresent circunstances it is absurd to insist on this elaborate procedure being gone through over matters of such tlining importance* vdmt with delajrg in the post and congestion on the wires I think a reasonable latitude might be conceded to men on the s ot, but the Treasury and the Government of India night see objections to this. I do not, hov/ever, think that the Government of India would be likely to object ri the limit within v/hich the two Governments could sanction exi^enditure without consulting each other were raised from £100 a year oods, l&gt;sq*, M.V.O., Treasury* to/1940.
