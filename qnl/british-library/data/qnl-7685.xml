SIMLA: GOVERNMENT CENTRAL BRANCH PRESS. 1909.PREFACE. In September, 1908, an attempt was made to compile, from such official information as was available, a statement regarding the proportions assumed during recent years by the Masqat arms traffic. This pamphlet brings the statistics then given down to the latest available date. At the same time it may be mentioned that separate confidential investigations which have been carried out by the Intelligence Branch of this Division during the arms season of 1908-09 would seem to make it clear that more arms and ammunition than appear in the returns officially supplied are actually imported into Masqat, and that, in con sequence, the trade is of even more serious proportions than is shown in these returns. The situation was considered by the Government of India in the autumn of last year. Proposals to check the traffic by means of a cordon of British troops aligned across the direction taken by the arms caravans, i. e. along the western portion of the Nushki-Robat route and so on into Persian territory, were rejected as impracticable from the military and undesirable from the political point of view. Similarly a suggestion to station British troops during the arms season along the coast of Persian Makran was dismissed. The opinion was expressed that perhaps the best hope of checking the trade was by means of increased naval activity in the Gulf of Oman, a scheme which would have involved a considerable increase in the number of ships on the station. This was also rejected on financial and other grounds. It is this scheme, however, which has again been put forward by the new Naval Commander-in-Chief after a consideration of the position. A new feature in the traffic, however, has to be taken into account in this connection. Confidential information recently obtained seems to indicate that the gun running may in the near future be spread over the whole year instead of taking place chiefly in the months January-April. The matter is being further investigated, but it seems that at the present time numerous small consignments of arms are constantly being sent across to the Makran coast, where they are taken charge of by the Baluch sirdars interested in the traffic and stored in safe custody pending the arrival of the Afghan caravans during the cold weather months. If this be so it is obvious that naval precautions, to be efficient, would have to be carried out throughout the year. It will be noted that the statistics given in the appendices are very incom plete. For our main facts we must rely on the actual arrivals at Masqat, which are summarised on pages 1 and 2. As regards the destination of arms subse quently reported from Masqat the official information is frequently very vague, e.g. y we are told that a boom, laden with arms and ammunition has left Masqat. This may mean anything from a dozen to several hundreds of rifles, and similarly with ammunition. It is hoped that in future improved arrangements may possibly result in more accurate intelligence. W. MALLESON, Colonel, Division 0} the Chief of the Staff. Simla ; Jth July igog.* at fnrtt of next DEC’e. I• It is not necessary to rewrite the political aspects, and the past history of the Arms Trade in the Persian Gulf. This has been fully and completely discussed by Mr. Lorimer in his memorandum on “ The Arms and Ammunition Traffic in the Gulfs of Persia and Oman The various Appendices herein, however, deal with the history of the trade in detail during the past three years. 2. The trade during the last few years has increased enormously, having nearly quadrupled itself. The Consular Trade Report for Masqat for 1905-06 gives the total value of the arms trade as Rs. 1,074,380 and, that of 1907-08 as Rs. 4,185,390 {vide Appendix IV). 3. The fact is also apparent that the coming of the Hamburg American steamers to the Gulf has given an immense impetus to this trade on the Conti nent, and that a large proportion of the trade is falling into the hands of non-English manufacturers. (For details vide Appendix V.) 4. During the last two years attempts have been made to stop the import of arms into Persia, but with comparatively small results. A couple of dhows were captured by the Navy, and one or two small shiploads thrown overboard by dhows when chased in 1908, but in March 1909 two dhows with 1,550 rifles and 170,000 rounds on board were seized on the high seas. What little success there has been is due to the efforts of Mr. New of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, who has instituted a system of guards along the Makran coast to watch the gun-runners. A short resume of the scheme will be found in Appendix I. 5. The Persians were also induced to make an attempt to stop the caravans between the coast and the Afghan Border, but the results effected were nil. A history of the action taken will be found in Appendix III. Appendix II contains all particulars available regarding the caravans, and the routes followed by them. 6. The double company at Robat was in 1908 increased by 500 men whilst the caravans were on the move, and the Jashk detachment was reinforced by 200 men owing to rumours that the gun-runners intended to avenge themselves on the posts for injuries and losses sustained at the hands of the Navy during that year, and at the hands of the Robat detachment during the previous one The garrisons at Robat and Jashk remained at 200 and 100 men respectively during the 1908-09 season. 7. To sum up ; the traffic has increased to an enormous extent during the past three years, and all steps taken materially to interfere with it have proved ineffec tual. The Navy appear to admit that they are practically powerless to accomplish much with the means at their disposal, the Persians have proved that they are helpless, the detachment at Robat has shown that it can do nothing to interfere with the progress of the caravans, whilst the proceedings at the Brussels Arms Conference have not as yet afforded any hope of a satisfactory settlement. 8. From the accompanying appendices the following figures have been arrived at. 1906. — Rifles. Percentage (of imports). Ammunition. Percentage. tTotal imports into Masqat ... 40 000 ... 9 , 30-&gt;,000 ... •Exported to Makran coast ... ... 3.175 8 Nil ...

However, it must be recollected that probably the greater proportion of the small bores imported come from the continent and are not included in the data for the figures given in the Appendix not being available. A considerable number of *303 rifles, and a large amount of the *303 ammunition have in the past been absorbed by the Persian Province of Pars vide this Division’s report on the subject of the distribution of arms in Southern Persia. But the tendency now is for all the better quality rifles to go to Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier, where, especially, there is a strong demand for *303 arms. &amp; 10. A list of the firms connected with the arms traffic into Masqat is to be found in Appendix VIII. It will be noted that the numbers shown in that state ment only represent a small proportion of the arms and ammunition actually imported into Masqat, when compared with the tables on pages 1 and 2. The latter numbers are obtained from cases, etc., reported as landed in Masqat; while the former is a record of statistics—admittedly incomplete—furnished by the Customs authorities at various English ports, and, in rare instances, by consular agents at Antwerp and elsewhere on the continent, reporting shipments of arms and ammunition destined for Masqat. The principal exporters of rifles during this and last year have been— Laubenherg &amp; Co. ... ... ... Birmingham. Livingstone, Zeytoon &amp; Co. ... ... Manchester. S. K. R. Cama &amp; Co. ... ... ... London. The principal exporters of ammunition have been— Haji Ali Akbar &amp; Son ... ... Manchester. E. W. Carling &amp; Co. ... ... London. The principal importers of rifles have been — Ali Khan bin Musa Khan. A. Goguyer. Purshotum Dhunji. Mirza Muhammad. The principal importers of ammunition have been— Padumsi Mulji. M. Husain. Ali Khan bin Musa Khan. A. Goguyer. 11. Attention must be directed to the discrepancy existing between the value of British arms and ammunition trade into Masqat between^!st April 1907 and 1 st April 1908 as_ given by the Masqat Consular Trade Report, and as obtained from the Shipping Returns. The former shows the value of the trade at Rs. 1,521,480 and the latter at Rs. 1,067,298. a difference of Rs. 454,182. Less than Rs. 100,000 of this difference is accounted for by the fact that some of the ships had sailed from England during the previous year, and that some had sailed from England before the 1st April 1908 and had not reached Masqat in time to be included in the Trade Report.

(3) News of intended landings of arms obtained by any of the patrols is immediately sent in to the nearest telephone station and transmit ted to Jashk or Chahbar. It is then forwarded on to His Majesty’s ships and to the Political Agent at Masqat. (4) Arrangements have been made with a few trustworthy Baluchis at various points above the telegraph line to impart information, for which they are rewarded. (5) The Telegraph Officers in charge at Jashk and Chahbar have been supplied with maps showing rivers, hills, villages, roads from up country, and telephone stations, with full particulars of the scheme to guide them in transmitting information received from the line.

One of these is always at Jashk or Chahbar and instead of, as formerly, ineffectually cruising off the coast, now relies wholly on the information supplied by the patrols before running out. It will be seen from the events of this year that these arrangements have met with some small measure of success. It is hoped at any rate that they will act as a deterrent to arms traffic between Masqat and the Makran coast which up to the time of their institution has been carried on practically with impunity.(!) APPENDIX II. route List of the arms caravans known to have made their way from the Makran Coast into Afghan territory during the years 1907, ,908 and 1909 giving the routes followed by them.

The Bandan-Baring road is crossed on the Kain border neat Hauz. 2. A caravan of about 200 camels with 80 men, in spite of an attempt to intercept it in the Kacha Gorge being made by the Chagai levies succeeded in reaching the Helmand in March 1907. They took the following route Bazman. Pansura. Shurab. Murghak. Padai. Kaleh-i-Bid. Chaunali (?). Dukduh. Katar Kanjak. Kharnai. Manzilab. Siah Karai. Ab-i-Ahuaa, Kacha. Zireh. Helmand. 3. On the 30th March 1907 an arms caravan which was following caravan No. 2 above mentioned, was ambushed by the Robat and Saindak levies in the Kacha Gorge and captured.The capture proved to consist of nearly 800 rifles and 70,000 rounds of ammunmon^ravan of ^ camelg received news f the Kacha capture at Bazman and being bound for Kandahar proceeded as under in May 1907 =- Din.

It travelled with caravan No. 4 as far as Bazman and then followed the same route as caravan No. 1 as far as Ab-i*Khara on the Nasratabad-Neh track. From this point h turned south east to Turshab, apparently with the idea of crossing the frontier near Bandar-i- Kamal Khan; becoming aware of the presence of a force of Sistanis at; Baluch Ab, a very short distance off, it turned from its line, and making north, joined the route followed by caravan No. 1 at Safidava. 6. A caravan consisting of 120 camels with 50 men made its way through into Afghanistan in April 1908 and took the following route Narmashir. Mazarab. Darshur. Panj Angusht. Baluch Ab. Jaru. Shila. Helmand (S. bank). Khwajeh Ali. Girishk. Kandahar. 7. An arms caravan consisting of about 80 camels with 50 men attempted to cross a corner of British Baluchistan in May. It started from Dashtiari and proceeded via :—* Dizak. Kuh-i-Safid. : . Talab River. Juzhak (S. of Amalaf). Meeting however at this point the reinforcement proceeding to Robat under Colonel Fowler and being turned back by them it escaped with all rapidity from such a dangerous vicinity and doubling Robat proceeded via Mirjawa. Ladis. Dizak. Galugheh. Dumagh.

Dasht-i-Mahi. Dak-i-Dila (on the Helmand). 8. The main Afghan Arms caravan consisting of some 1,500 camels with about 1,200 men and carrying about 50,000 rifles and 2 million rounds of ammunition, most of which had been landed in the vicinity of Jashk, started from the coast at the beginning of May 1908 and proceeding by two routes one being via :— Angushki, Sirik, Taling, Jaghin, Manujan, and the other by— Jaghdan, Anguran, assembled at Chah-i-Malik 10 miles south-east of Rigan on the 22nd May. On the 26th May it was attacked at Dashtak by 50 Persians under Shaukat-ul- Mamalik but after a skirmish proceeded unharmed to Garagheh via :— Shuru, Mazarab, Gurg, Nasratabad Sipi. At Garagheh the caravan split up into two parties in order to facilitate the march through the difficult country between that place and the Helmand. The river was reached by one party on the gth June via :— Tappeh-i»Khak-i-Darvish. Rigavak. Dak-i-Dila. And by the other party on the nth June via Baluch Ab (Pain). Shila. Dasht-i-Tarakhun. Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. It was reported later that the Dak-i Dila party marched for Herat and the BandarT-Kamal Khan party for Ghazni. 9.

Several other small caravans have been reported, but particulars are not forthcoming as to size or route.9 APPENDIX III. A precis of the action taken by the Persian Government to suppress the running of arms caravans through South-East Persia in igo 8 and igog. Although the Persian Government gave certain assurances as to the measures it proposed to take for the suppression of illicit arms traffic and issued orders to the local administrations of Provinces through which the caravans of arms traders would pass, no practical result ensued. The sum-total of effort, however, consisted of certain half-hearted and isolated attempts to intercept arms caravans on their way from the Makran Coast to the Afghan border. The first attempt was made near Rigan where a large caravan of about 750 Telegram from Mr. James, telegraphist at Bam, men and over 1,000 camels had assembled. Gaveraor-Getiend, Baluchistan, Under orders of the Bam authorities Shau- ^ 1 ° a ^ 1 ° kat-ul-Mamalik with 50 men attacked this caravan at Dashtak on the 26th May, but his force being insufficient he retired after a skirmish and the Afghans proceeded on their way unharmed. On the same date a force of 400 men under Rifat Nizam left Bam with the avowed intention of attacking and capturing the above-mentioned caravan, but were, of course, too late and never came up with it. Rifat Nizam on reaching Fahreh disbanded his troops and returned to Bam. Peremptory orders were also issued to the Deputy Governor of Sistan Telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and Kain to Send Out troops tO intercept for Sistan and Kain to the Foriegn Department. such arms caravans as attempted to pass through their territories, but no expenditure was sanctioned or organised arrange ments made for supplies.

About 50 men also were collected at Varmal but little was expected of them. Chagai Diary No. 21 of July 190 S. armed with rifles, It was reported, moreover, that out of these numbers only about a hundred were On the 18th May Purdil Khan hearing of the advance of an arms caravan made dispositions to cut it off and moved out towards Baluch Ab.

Apparently the men took good result that the loss they inflicted was nil After this fruitless eflort Purdil Khan and his men returned to Lutak. No resistance was offered to the main caravan which passed through shortly afterwards, beyond the capture and decapitation of two Afghan stragglers, who were found asleep, Purdil Khan contending that as the attempt to capture the smaller caravan had been a failure, there was still less chance of succes with the larger one, and his force might as well be withdrawn. care to kept out of danger with the and the caravan escaped with ease. Sistan Diary No. 25 , of July 1508 . Certain inadequate arrangements were, at the same time, under the orders of the Governor-General of Khorasan, made by the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, the Deputy Governor of Kain, for dealing with Afghan arms caravans that might pass through his Province.Muhammad Yusuf Khan was put in charge of a force of about 800 men Sistan Diaries No 4 of May loos and No. 24 of with his head-quarters at Bandan. Doubt- June 1908. less the Shaukat-ul-Mulk did bis best, but the bulk of these troops were armed with obsolete weapons and could not be expected to effect anything against strong parties of well-armed Afghans. It was a cause of much relief to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk that all the Afghan caravans made their way through Sistan and that he was not called upon to oppose them. To sum up; although ample warning had been given to the Persian Government of the march of Afghan arms traders through south-eastern Persia and full information of the movements of the various caravans communicated to the local authorities, not a single one of these caravans was intercepted or so much as turned from its way: all that had been done was to incense Afghan feeling against the Persians by the latter’s attempt to interfere with the caravans and by the murder of the Afghan stragglers. The arms smuggling traffic has now almost assumed the character of an armed invasion of Persia, and as the Persian Government would appear to be totally incapable of protecting its frontiers, it seems that once the arms have been safely landed on the Persian coast there is little or no further impediment to be feared by the caravans. During the 1908-09 season the Persian authorities took no steps to stop the traffic in arms through their territory. Capture of Dhows in Persian Gulf by H. M. S. “ Fox ” in March 1909 . On March 7 , H. M. S. “ Pox ” captured a dhow without flag or papers, be- longing to Masqat territory, and carrying 350 rifles (*450 bore, 100 of which were M’-fl*) and 50,000 rounds. The vessel surrendered on a blank charge being fired. The crew were handed over to the Sultan of Masqat for punishment. The dhow was burnt at Jashk on March 14 . On March 13 , ‘ Fox ’ captured a second dhow from Fakan off Pas-ash‘Shir containing 1,200 rifles and 120,000 rounds. 160 rifles were *303 and the rest good M.-H. 1 he crew of the dhow opened fire on the cutter of the “Fox”, w ic returned fire w ith a Maxim.

ON THE MASQAT ARMS TRAFFIC, SIMLA: DIVISION OF THE CHIEF OF THE STAFF, ARMY HEAD QUARTERS, INDIA.JN compiling last year such official information as was available regarding the Masqat Arms Traffic it was impossible not to be struck by the numerous lacuna in our knowledge of that trade. An attempt has accordingly been made, by means of special agents of the Intelligence Branch, to throw some light on the many obscure points regarding which further information was most desirable. The reports which follow give the results of our investigations down to the present time. It is not claimed that they in any way exhaust the subject. On the contrary, our enquiries are still proceeding, and we are endeavouring to trace a few typical consignments of arms right through from the merchants of Masqat to their ultimate destination—the hands of the frontier Pathan. But there will probably be found in the reports now printed much information of value. Attention may be invited to the original letters and quotations on pages 35 to 39, which show at what marvellously cheap prices perfectly efficient rifles can be shipped at European ports. The enormous profits which are made at every stage ; the manner in which practically all Masqat, from the Sultan down to the meanest of his subjects, has a direct interest in the trade ; the swindling of the Sultan by his own officials; the falsification of returns whereby we must be left more than ever in doubt regarding the real percentage of the traffic which finds its way to the neighbourhood of our frontier; the methods adopted by the Afghan and Pathan dealers in purchasing and shipping their arms ; and the facility with which, apparently, arms can be smuggled into India itself—all these points will be found in the reports which follow. In connection with these enquiries I paid a brief visit to Masqat in March last, and was enabled to visit the sample rooms of several of the rifle merchants and, accompanied by the owner, the outside of M. Goguyer’s large warehouse, which certainly looked as if it contained the 100,000 arms which some of our informants speak of. A further selection of these reports will be printed in due course. Meanwhile, as our agents run very serious risks in carrying out their investigations, it is particularly requested that this pamphlet be kept under lock and key, that it never goes out of an officer’s hands, and that it be not quoted or alluded to in any way except in secret papers. W. MALLESON, Colonel, Assistant Quarter Master General for Intelligence,[SECRET.] Method of raising money (or buying arms. REPORT OF SECRET AGENTS “A” AND “B.”* The people (Afghans) who trade in arms may be divided into three categories:— ( 1 ) Big merchants who have been en gaged in the arms trade for years, such as Nurakai. ( 2 ) Merchants who are regular traders in India or Afghanistan in cloth, carpets, etc., and who have recently taken to arms trading. ( 3 ) The poor adventurers attracted by the quick and big profits to be made in the arms trade. Class I have usually sufficient cash of their own, but if they require more the Amir will lend it to them. Some reports say that the Amir takes no interest on these loans, but other reports mention ‘ Chihlak , or one-fortieth, i.e., 2i per cent. The money is said to be repaid in five yearly instalments. (Probably, directly or indirectly, the Amir makes something out of the loans.) Class II have either enough cash of their own or, from their regular trade deal ings, have credit, with the banias and dalals at places like Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan and Calcutta. They are accustom ed to take advances from these men, and the banias, although they probably know well enough (vide reluctance of Dera Ismail Khan brokers this year) need not neces sarily be told that the money is required for arms trading. The interest charged is 10 per cent, fora 4 months’ loan if security is good and 13 per cent, to 16 per cent, for 4 months on less security. Mathra Das of Peshawar is one of these brokers. Class III cannot approach the Amir and have no introduction to the Hindu brokers. They usually combine in small parties, each, perhaps, contributing Rs. 500 . If thev have not this amount of their own C 14 I. B. * These men visited Masqat, etc., in December 1008 and January 1903.2 they will borrow at interest from their friends and relations. This is also the procedure of the Adam Khel Afridis. Like the Ghilzais, they will also take interest on loans.* * Some of the Adam Khel who went this year had practically no money of their own. They agreed to pay the lenders from one-third to half of their profits. In addition to the above-mentioned capitalists a few poor individuals follow in the train of the bigger merchants. The merchants engage them as camel-drivers and pay them Rs. 2 per camel they are in charge of. One man can manage from six to eight camels. The merchant allows him to take his wages in rifles at Masqat rates, so on arrival at Kabul he may find himself the possessor of three Martini rifles. Our men could hear nothing of the Amir or Nasrulla personally, or of the State, having commissioned the traders to buy rifles for them; neither did they hear of the Amir having purchased rifles from the traders last year. There was a report at Jashk that the Amir had given Nurakai permission to im port 100,000 rifles this season. 1 . The principal tribes that are engaged in the arms trade are — *In former reports I have mentioned that Malik Feroz, A man Khel, of Kohat Paas, finances many of the ‘ Pass ’ Adam Khel.

From all the reports our men heard and £ Method of procedure- irom then- conversations with Afghan arms traders it appears that an insignificant pro portion of the traders reach the Gulf ports overland. Nearly all come by sea from Bombay and Karachi. They appear all to go by steamer, and no case was heard of in which the traders had gone up the Gulfby sailing boat from Karachi. They do not even arrange for their men with caravans to meet them on the Persian coast. There is, however, a considerable trade in fruit and cloth between Afghanistan and Bandar Abbas, and Afghan traders, after selling their goods at Bandar Abbas, sometimes go on to Masqat and purchase arms. The arms traders who come by sea usually send the greater number of their party to Bandar Abbas to purchase camels there, as they prefer the Afghan camel to the weak animals of Makran. The majority of the arms traders were well-known Ghilzai merhants whose nor mal trade is with Calcutta, Bombay and Central India in the winter. These men come from Kabul, Ghazni, etc., by the ordinary Peshawar or Dera Ismail Khan routes. Being merchants on a big scale, with business connections of many years’ stand ing, they have either the money or the credit to finance their operations, and for the last two years these men have been engaging in the arms trade, finding it more profitable than this ordinary business. They generally embark in small parties of from 4 to 10 men at Bombay or Karachi, and in most cases they book to Bandar Abbas or Basrah—no Afghans being allow ed to book direct for Masqat. They make their purchases and other arrangements independently and only collect to form a big caravan when they have completed their purchases. When buying their steamer tickets they frequently describe themselves as pilgrims going to Baghdad or Kerbala and book to Basrah to avoid suspicion, but, if oppor tunity offers, they will leave the ship at some nearer port. By bribing minor officials they can sometimes disembark at Masqat. If they have had to go straight through to Basrah they return by steamer to Bandar Abbas or Jashk—but mostly to Bandar Ab bas whence they proceed by land to Jashk, A certain number also book direct to Jashk,rnamm 4 and Clialibar by British India boats. How ever, they do not like to do this in large numbers as it would create suspicion. The party now divides up, the majority remaining at or going to Bandar Abbas while a few, among whom are the leaders, go to Jashk, Chahbar or some port in the vicinity. The men at Bandar Abbas either remain quietly there until the pur chasers have completed their business, or else—as is usually the case—they wait for the arrival of caravans from Afghanistan and secure the necessary camel trans port. When they have collected the camels, and they think that the rifles may be shortly expected, they move down the coast and lie up in places where there is good grazing near the expected landing places. The leaders who have gone to Jasbk, Chahbar or other ports close by, enlist the sendees of the local Baluch Sardars. They agree to pay the Baluch Sardars a fixed rate for each rifle landed, and in return for this the Sardars arrange for a sailing boat for the crossing to Masqat, provide them with one of their own men as a guide, and advise them as to where to land their arms. Frequently one or two of the party remain on the Persian side—say at Jashk—to complete arrange ments there and to keep in touch with the rest of the party at Bandar Abbas. The headmen and the guide then em bark for Masqat, but they usually make for Batinah or Barkah, or some other small port above Masqat, and then bear down the coast to Masqat. If starting from Chah bar they may make first for Quryat, Jalan and Sur, small ports east of Masqat. This especially applies to Baluchi traders. (The Baluchis sometime cross from Jashk or Chahbar by steamer, the Afghans seem to go by dhow always.) In Masqat the Afghans have to try to keep clear of any spies the British Consul may have in his pay, and they usually wear Baluch clothes, but the risk is very slight as everyone, even those in consulate employ, is more or less openly favourable Our man gives the following figures :— 60% book to Bandar Abbas. 20% „ Gwadar, Chahbar and Jashk&gt; 20 % „ Lingeh, Bushire and Basrah*5 * Two days f-om Masqat perhaps, but once they have worked up the Batinah coast they can slip across in a night. to them. Their guide introduces them to the gun-merchants, or to the gun-merchants’ touts, and they go to the merchants’ private houses and transact their business there. The merchants keep samples of all rifles and ammunition in their own houses. The Afghans give their orders and pay cash for what they want and the merchants arrange for the rifles to be taken down by night to small rowing boats which are waiting near the Sultan’s palace at Mokalla, and from here they row off to their sailing slop which is waiting at or near Matrah the same dhow as they came across in). The Nakhudas — i.e., Captains of the dhows—then assume all responsibility. These men understand their business well. They are well up in all the routes and harbours and they are gen erally well informed as to the position and movements of the British gun-boats. They usually sail up the coast forwards Barkah or down the coast towards Quryat, and then cross the Gulf by unfrequented routes and make for the landing place on the Persian side as previously settled. They usually reach their destination without any difficulty. Crossing takes nearly two days with fair wind.* Arrived at the Persian port the Baluch Sr.rdars are there ready to help them. They unload the boats and if their camels are ready they would move some distance inland at once; if the camels are not ready the Baluch Sardars store their arms for them. Landing places- (A double company at Jashk, or rather &lt;»t that part of it known locally as “ Bungilian.”) They wait until a strong caravan is collected before finally moving off Afghan- istan-wards. This year most of the Afghans have decided to land their arms near Jashk. Their reasons for selecting the vicinity of Jasl.k a^e :— (a) The local Baluch Sardars are ready to give all assistance at reasonable rates. (b) There are no British troops there and the small telegraph guard is someway off the landing places. (c) There are good harbours close by. 14 I. B.(d) Although there are two British gun-boats cruising in the Gulf of Oman the people say that they cannot take any hostile action on Persian soil and that once landed the gun-runners are safe. Also the gun-boats are watching the coast west of Jashk and most (f the Afghans mean to land east of that place.* The places that have been definitely de cided upon as landing places are Grishkin and Chaikalau which are b tween Gabrig and Sadaich. The Afghans who are worki ng through Mir Mustafa Khan, Baluch Sardar, of Jashk, are landing their arms at Grishkin and those who are employing his brother, Nur Muhammad Khan, will land at Chaika- lau. Others, who are getting assistance from the third brother, Mir Br.rkat Khan, will land at Bunji, Brijak, Biriz, Gunari, Sirik or Bund ram, west of Jashk, all in Biaban. One consignment of 400 rifles has already been landed at Bunji and they have been taken away to Shirahan, about one march away, where they are waiting for camels and the caravan to start. The Afghans who are employing Islam Khan of Bint, and Mahmud Khan of Dashtiari, both Baltich Sirdars, will land west of Ohahbar, most probably at Puzim, but there are other possible places also west of Chahbar, namely, Kunarak, Gurdim, Tank, Darak, Galag and Sadaich. To the east of Chahbar arrangements are made by Sardars Mahmud Khan, Mir Abmad Khan and the latter’s brother, Jan Muhammad. Arms are intended to be landed this season at Pasa Bandar. Baluch gun-run ners intend to land here. Other possible landing places on this side of Chahbar are Kinj Dap, Gwatar and Pishukan. i-ast season some of the Afghansf land, their consignments near Bandar Abb and between that place and Lingeh.

The headman was one Muhammad Ah, Mush Khel, Suluman Khel, of Urgun, son of Shinkai; address in Kabul, care of Ibra him, Mush Khel, Sarai Dada Sher; has dealings w ith Seth Mathra Das of Peshawar. He is a well-known cloth and carpet mer chant trading between Kabul and Calcutta. Has traded in arms before, but would give no particulars. This winter (1908 09 ) he came via Kur- ram and went to Calcutta. There he collected money from dalals, i.e, brokers— with whom he had dealings, and left by train for Bombay with two of his relations and a party of five other men under Darya Khan. Muhammad Ali and his two relations had Rs. 7,700 and Darya Khan and his party Rs. 5,000 with them. They all went by steamer to Jashk where our men ran across them. Our men were passing them selves off as arms traders and had approach ed Mir Mustafa Khan for assistance. Muhammad Ali also went to the same man, (i.e. r Mustafa Khan). Our men, Muhammad Ali and Mir Mustafa Khan, all met at a store keeper’s house at Jashk and they came to an agreement with Mustafa Khan. They were to pay him Re. 1 for each rifle safely landed and in return for this Mir Mustafa Khan arranged for them to land their rifles at Grishkin where one of his men would be ready to meet them. (The man was to be either Isa, an assistant or servant of the British doctor at Jashk or an Afghan, named Sarfaraz.) Meanwhile it was arranged that the rest of Muhammad Ali’s party should go to Bandar Abbas to procure camels and they would bring them down to Yakdar— near Gabrig—where they would wait until the arms arrived. Mustafa Khan then told off Ids father-in- law, Dur Muhammad Khan, to go with them to Masqat as a guide. Dur Muhammad »8 Khan had some married sisters living on the Masqat side and he promised to put the party up in one of his brothers-in-law s houses. He said that he, Muhammad Ali and Darya Khan would wear Baluch clothes and he would take them to the merchants’ houses. Dur Muhammad Khan had been three times previously to Masqat in this capacity. Dur Muhammad Khan procured a sail ing boat from one Rahim Dad of Jashk, and they loaded this up with dates, fish, etc., to remove suspicion. They intended to sail for Batinah and thence make for Matrah. Mustafa Khan also gave them a letter to Islam Khan of Bint, a relation of his, through whose district they would have to pass when they finally started off for Afghanistan with the caravan. (Our men did not go to Masqat with them.) Of Muhammad All’s party of eight men, six went to Bandar Abbas for camels and only he and Darya Khan crossed to Masqat with the guide. If matters went well Muhammad Ali had promised to write to his Ghilzai friends at Calcutta and Bombay and they would also come to Masqat, make their purchases independently and join his caravan for the return journey. He would also have more money sent to him and would make further purchases on a much larger scale. The above is a fair example of the way the traders manage the gun-running. The gun-runners, who are landing their ,r.m c„., t lak c n b y re « orain , „ r .va.. arms this year at Grishkin and Chaikalau, intend to make for Afghanistan by the f jllowing route :— Grishkin or Chailkalau.

This route was taken last year by Lai Jan and Din Muhammad and 48 men with about 1,000 rifles and 200,000 cartridges. They landed their rifles at Puzim. 14 LB.* E. When they land their rifles near Bandar Abbas at places such as Sirik, Kuhistak (east of Bandar Abbas) and Kung, List- aghan, Khamir, Pul, etc. (west of Bandar Abbas) they proceed as follows :*— * Our men’s information shows that none of the Afghans are using these ports this year Baghu (or Yaghu). Hasan Langi. Gurband. Tutang. Navargu. Ruhkan Duzi. Gul Hashgar (Gulashgird ?). Halil. Rudbar. Rigan. Beyond Rigan they could give no parti culars, except that a portion of the caravans usually went to Herat. A caravan of arms went by this route last year. They said it was a difficult road for Afghans. The people of Kirman were hostile to them. According to Afghan statements practi cally all the caravans when once they have crossed into Afghanistan make straight for Kandahar via the Helmand. A small amount of their arms is sold there and they then proceed to Ghazni, near which most of them live. They stay a short time near Ghazni and dispose of some rifles and then go on to Kabul. By far the greater number of arms are sold in Kabul. The merchants have their shops or godowns there where they can store their arms and sell at their leisure. The traders say that the caravan takes about 65 days to reach Kabul from the coast. This is actual day’s marching with- out halts. 1 . A. Goguyer, French. 2. Baijeot &amp; Co., Russian or French. 3 .

Their fears are due to the action they believe the British Government are taking to prevent Afghans from coming. There is also a report that the British Government means to buy out the trade at Masqat. The customs duty levied by the Sultan on rifles and ammunition is 6 per cent, ad valorem, and the merchants think that the British Consul will offer the Sultan a larger sum than he can rely on from the customs, in order to stop the trade. For these reasons most of the merchants had not risked ordering out very large consignments this season. Only Goguyer, who is inti mate with the Sultan, had imported as large a quantity as usual, and he was con tinuing to send large orders to Europe. So far this season not many Afghan buyers had been to Masqat, and prices had dropped in consequence.* The merchants said that formerly their business depended on the Arab trade with the “ hinterland/' and that only the last year or two there had been this extraordinary rush of Afghans. The Afghan purchasers were very welcome as they bought in large quantities and were very free with their money. They were ready to bribe anybody and every body. It is very hard to say, even approximate ly, what stock of rifles there is in Masqat. Our man made careful enquiries from several firms, and he was told by Malcolm12 and Harman that he could get 77,000 good rifles (magazine, Martini-Henri and Martini-Metford (‘ 303 ) and good quality Gras rifles from the various firms in Mas qat now, exclusive of Goguyer’s stock, and that of the older pattern rifle such as Sniders, Gras, etc., there were probably 100.000 in Masqat.* * See “d03cription and prices of rifes at Masqat.” The total of 77,000 was arrived at after carefully calculating the numbers of dif ferent kinds of rifles. The 100,000 is merely an approximation. Our man was told by Abdul Ghafur, the Inspector of Customs at Masqat, that Goguyer had 5,000 cases of rifles in stock, and each case seems to contain at least 20 rifles. Most of them were believed to be Martini-Henri and short Martini-Metford rifles. This would mean 100,000 rifles, and altogether there are apparently about 250.000 rifles in Masqat. This season the merchants are giving stock of ammunition- 400 rounds of ammunition with each rifle priced at Its. 100 or over and 100 rounds with each rifle at less than Its. 100 , and it is believed that they have enough ammunition in stock to do this, as well as to meet demands for extra ammunition. Last year the merchants gave 200 rounds per rifle of whatever quality or descrip tion, Our man asked Malcolm what cartridges he could supply apart from any purchase of rifles he might make. The merchant offered to supply the following at once, not necessarny from his own stock, bu! he could procure them locally:— 30,0C0 *303 cartridges 300.000 M.H. 200.000 Gras 1 r ° Lllct L ^ ~ ui men come to Masqat to buy only cartridges, and the merchants keep an extra stock for this purpose. There were no signs of the Afghan market being glutted with rifles and of the demand being only for' car n ges, though the course of trade may incline gradually in this direction in a few years’ time.13 Our man heard nothing about the stork of ammunition being short last year. All the Afghans appear to have taken their full complement, but one d ow-load of ammunition was too late to catch the caravan, and the Afghans told Barkat Khan to keep the ammunition in payment of his services instead of cash. The most popular rifles with the Af ghans are the especially the N. S. W. rifles marked with a crown and known as Tajdar rifle—and the *303 Martini- Metford carbine, this is called by them the ‘ Dixon ’ rifle. There is a very small demand for the Mannlicher and Mauser rifles, presumably on account of their unfamiliarity, the diffi culty in quickly replacing ammunition, and the absence of components and spare parts. The demand for the '303 magazine rifle would be very large, only the merchants cannot as yet procure them in large quan tities. When our man especially asked Malcolm to get some '303 rifles for him, he said that he would try, but that he was not hopeful. The Arabs usually only buy the cheaper kinds of rifles; Sniders, Werndl and Gras rifles are in demand with them. The Baluchis prefer the cheap M.-H. rifles marked “ Martini-Muscat,” made by German firms. The people of Kirman mostly buy the M.-H. rifles, but only a small trade is done with them. Of their last season’s sales (winter 1907 - 08 ), the merchants estimate that § of the rifles taken across the Gulf were for Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier and A for Persia and Makran. The Masqat merchants say that for their regular business they have to depend on the Arabs who come and buy all the year round. The Arabs usually buy in small quantities at a time, but the total trade is large. The Arabs take the rifles to Dibai and Kuwait and Dalmah, and it appears that they keep a stock of rifles, brought from Masqat, for sale in these places.14 Our men 1 'eard of a certain number of rifles being sold to Persians from these Arab ports r.nd taken across tbe Gulf to Pa risian, etc., and some of the Afghans said that if the British stopped them from going to Masqat they would go to D bai or Kuwait for their rifles. However, Persians and Afghans prefer to purchase direct at Masqat, as this saves an extra middleman s profits and the purchase of rifles in the Upper Arabian ports for taking across the Gulf is exceptional. It appears that practically all the rifles bought by Arabs stay in Arabia and arc sold in the ‘ hinterland.’ Malcolm and Baijeot said that the Arab trade averaged about 100,000 rifles annually, but, as they made this remark when our men suggested a reduction of prices on account of the slackness of sales, it cannot be taken too literally. At the same time there is certainly a large trade with the Arabs, and the merchants said that only last year the Afghan trade equalled the Arab trade. The Arabs can sometimes ship their rifles to Dibai and Kuwait by the British India boats. The Inspector of Customs at Masqat said that if the Arab merchants made it worth his while he could bribe the Captain, Chief officer, booking clerk, etc.j of the steamers and get rifles and am munition shipped at Masqat for Dibai and Kuwait, as Masqat ‘ Halwa ’ (sweets). This was done in the S.S. Dwarka, Dumra, and Kola. But, as a general rule, the smaller men all take their arms up the Arab coast in dhows. While our men were in Masqat they saw a good number of Arabs buying arms. People who assist the gun-runners-15 had been unable to collect sufficient men and camels, went back to Karachi to get help from Dost Muhammad. The big dealers usually visit him on their way through Karachi. At Bandar Abbas .—There is a man Jan Muhammad, Sulaiman Khel, a broker, who lives there with his family, helps them in collecting camels, changing their money and hundis, gives information re routes, boats, etc., receives money on deposit. Does a large business. At Qishm Island .—There is a man Abdul Ghafur, an Afghan, who helps them in getting boats, guides, etc. His assistance is sought by the men who go from Bandar Abbas to Dibai. At Dibai —There is one Saiyid Umar, who keeps a langar there. Afghans going for arms make the excuse of going to visit him as a holy man. He helps them in every way. At Masqat .—All the gun merchants help the Afghans to procure boats and get their arms away. Ali Khan bin Musa Khan and Haroun bin Khamas were especially pro minent in this respect. The Sultan of Masqat’s Inspector of Customs, Abdul Ghafur Khan, a native of Poona. This man helps the Arabs in ship ping their arms by British India boats to the Upper Gulf ports. One of our men got to know him well. He offered to procure him any arms he want ed, and said that he had 250 rifles and a large number of cartridges of his own wdiich he was prepared to sell at cheaper rates than the merchants. He offered to arrange for sailing boats at Matrah, and he also said that he could get our man’s arms landed at- some small post on the Persian side—not at one of the regular points of call—by the Bri tish India S.S. Dwarka. He gave our man a letter of introduction to the Police Jemadar at Gwadar. His uncle, Abdul Karim, is Col lector of Customs at Masqat, and between the two there are doubtless many schemes for smuggling, etc.16 As Abdul Ghriur had 250 rifles and he had disposed of many more before this, and much ammunition in his own posses sion, which he probably got from the Masqat merchants, it seems a fair inference to assume that he helps them to land more rifles than they declare in their customs de clarations, and he is, probably, hand in glove with the shipping people too. The Sultan of Masqat. —The trade means so much to him that he is willing to assist as far as lies in his power. If British gun boats capture dhows within the 3-mile belt, they hand them over to the Sultan. He gives the cargo back to the boatmen and allows them to ship away again at night. Abdul told our man that on 25th or 26th December 1908, a boat belonging to Aribs with 250 rifles was captured by a British gun-boat and handed over to Sultan. The latter gave them back their rifles and Jet them go at night time. On Makran Coast. —At Gwadar the Sul tan’s Collector of Customs is a Hindu called Jetta. He is a friend of Abdul Karim at Masqat. He is ready to help in procuring boats, camels, etc. From Gwadar to Chahbar. —The Baluch Sirdar Mahmud Khan of Dashfciari makes all arrangements for the Afghans in the same way as Mustafa Khan and his brothers do at Jashk.

These men help the gun-runners on the coast and inland as far as Sarbaz.

The Masqat merchants, like most tradesmen, exaggerated the amount and value of their business, and, as trade rivals, they did not know the statistics of other firms, and 'were not inclined to impart the truth about their own. Number of rifles exported to Persian coast A,,* ing winter season, 1907&gt;08. QUf [Malcolm put last season’s trade with the Persian coast (Afghans, Baluchis, Per sians, North-West Frontier tribes), down at 200,000 rifles, but our man considered this greatly exaggerated.] To arrive at even approximately cor rect totals, it would be necessary to have men stationed permanently at Masqat^ Jashk, Chahbar, etc. The Arab trade is particularly hard to estimate, as the Arabs are buying rifles in small lots of tens and hundreds all the year round. We have the following few points to go on :— A.—Mahi Khel and Kbarotis seen at Bandar Abbas, Jashk and Karachi, and questioned separately, all gave more or less the same information with regard to the big caravan they got through last year. They say that this caravan reached its full strength at Bazman, and from thereon it consisted of over 1,500 camels carrying 30,000 rifles with 200 rounds per rifle (less one boat-load of ammuni tion, probably about 100,000 rounds). The distribution of this caravan they give as :— ■ Murad Khel 6,000 rifles : Kharoti 12,000 rifles; Mahi Khel 12,000rifles : Total 30,000 rifles. 7 rom another source one of our men heard that the Nasero tribe had imported 3,300 rifles, but it is probable that these are included in the above 30,000. B. If we try to arrive at the figures from the number of camels taken, we get nearly the same number.19 1 . The Afghans say that they load np at least 20 rifles and 200 rounds am munition per rifle on each camel. Also all agree that the big caravan consisted of over 1,500 camels. If we make the liberal allowance of 10 per cent, camels being used lor kit and rations we get 1,350 camels loaded with rifles, and this would give us 27,000 rifles as a minimum. There were between 700 and 800 men with the caravan, each carrying, presumably, a rifle, and wo know that one boat-load of ammunition was short, so this should bring the total to over 28,000 rifles. 2 . We know that a caravan of 50 men and 60—70 camels under Lai Jan and Din Muhammad, Sulaiman Khel, went sepa rately from the big caravan. Allowing 10 camels for food, etc., this would give us a total of, say, 1,000 rifles. fh M e can also get some idea from the amount paid in bribes to the Daluch Sirdars. 1 . Lai Jan and Din Muhammed (as above) landed 800 rifles at Parsa Bandar and Kmj Dap. They were being helped by Mir Mahmud Khan, Mir Ahmad Khan and Jan Muhammad. They paid them Ps. 8,000 at Rs. 10 per rifle. The same men also landed 200 rifles at Puzim. 2. The party that landed at Gabrig paid Nur Muhammad commission on 2,000 rifles. 3. Those that landed close to Jashk paid Mir Mustafa Khan on 500 rifles. 4. Those that landed west of Jashk at Bunji, etc., paid Barkat Khan Rs. 9,000 in cash, and gave him a boat-load of cartridges said to be worth from Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 7,000. Total Rs. 15,000. The contract with him was at Rs. 1-6 per rifle, but the landing w T as hurried owing to the arrival of a gun-boat, and a careful settle ment of accounts could not be made. The Kharotis told our men that most of them had got off at about 12 annas per rifle. This would bring the average to20 about Ee. 1 per rifle = 15,000 rifles. 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 give the amounts paid to only six Baluch Sardars, and the total of rifles comes to 18,500. Neither A, B, nor C include the Baluch or Persian trade. They also do not include any trade via Bandar Abbas. From the above we can safely put down the direct importations from Masqat into Afghanistan at least 30,000 rifles for the 1907-08 winter season (i.e., October 1907 to May 1908), it was probably greater, and perhaps 40,000 would be nearer the mark. Also a good many rifles find their way into Afghanistan through Baluchis. Our men heard the names of the follow- Last year’s traders, ing men of last season’s trade :— Lai Jan and Din Muhammad, Sulaiman Khel. Hakim Jan, Haji Khan and Ibrahim Khan with mixed party of Nasirs, Kharotis and Sulaiman Khel. Abdul Ghafur, Saiyid Khan and Islam Khan with a party of 124 Nasirs and Su’aiman Khel. Our men went too early in the season This year’s trade and traders, to judge what the Afghan trade will be this year (1903-09). Buying had scarcely commenced, and they only heard of one consignment of rifles having been landed on the Persian coast by Afghans. The people they met were mostly advance parties, who had gone to make arrangements and to see whether the prospect for this season were favourable. They are likely to be joined by many others if things go well.* . T e man we sent in January should he able Our men came across the following t0 teIJ us a11 about this if he succeeds - parties :— 1.

This was in December 1908. Mir Ghulam Basul hopes to sell these rifles to Afghans. ii • • : / is - -p ' {Z) Abdul Nabi, son of Dad Rahim of Hyderabad (Sind), and Fazl, who have been carrying on the business of cloth merchants in Bint for many years, went to M sqat with some Baluchis and bought 100 rifles and 11,000 cartridges. These are for sale in Bint. (3) Sirdar Islam Khan, Hakim of Bint, himself went to Masqat this winter and purchased 190 rifles and a lot of cart ridges. He put his purchases into two sailing boats and returned himself by steamer to Chahbar. On the way across the Captain of the dhow, which had 90 rifles on board, caught sight of one of the British India boats and, thinking she was a gun-boat, threw all the rifles over board. The remaining 100 were landed safely. : i. &gt; ; . . v * l , (4) Mir Saiy.’d Khan of Geh imported 170 rifles from Masqat this season. Our men believe that the majority of the rifles purchased by Baluchis And their way into Afghanistan. The Baluch traders sell at 100 per cent, profit to Afghans and 50 per cent, profit to other Baluchis. On the Makran Coast most of the people had rifles. Our men do not know to what extent the people living inland are armed. Nimroz, Hakim of Mash Khel, is buying rifles for himself to arm his following with. He buys at Dizak and Sarbaz. N.B .—The Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield cannot be bought at Masqat in any num bers.24 ' Our man arrived at tlie'ie figures in the following manner : He made himself out to be an agent from the Nawab of Dir, and he said that he had been commissioned to make purchases on a very large scale for the a ming of the whole state. The firms in Masqat appear to form small rings, each composed of 3 or 4 merchants. The mer chants in one ring mutually help each other in making up deficiencies of stock, etc. Our man went to Malcolm first. In his ring are included Baijeot and Harun-bin- Khamas. He then went to Muhammad Abdulla, with whom are one Abdur Rahim, Ali Khan-bin-Musa Khan and another man (not known). He was not able to enter into negotiations with each firm, as he could not have kept it secret from the others and by patronising rival establish ments he would have been thrown over by the people upon whom he was relying for his information. He did not approach Goguyer, but he says that the Afghans nearly all work through either Hamn Ali Khan-bin-Musa Khan or Muhammad Abdulla, and that he believes Goguyer go?s in mainly for the Arab trade.* The figures he gives are the totals he got from the Malcolm and Muhammad Abdulla rings, and were given him as the number of rifles he could procure immedi ately on the spot in Masqat. Malcolm said that he could cable to Europe and get out any particular sort of rifle in any quantity required, also cart ridges, within two months. The native firms required three months’ notice.

The cost of the various rifles is given in detail under “ Description of Rifle and prices at Masqat/’ The amount the Afghans Cost of importing rifles into Afghanistan and profits made-It 4 and 31 have to pay the Baluch Sardars for their help, boat hire and guides varies somewhat according to which individual they employ and the number of rifles they are importing. Barkat Khan, who arranges for traders landing west of Jashk, did the largest business last year. His rates were— For himself, one cart ridge and For boat and boatmen For guide .. Total Rs. a. p. 16 0 per rifle landed. ditto. ditto. 2 14 0 and 1 cartridge per rifle. As has been described elsewhere (number of rifles exported to Persian coast, 1907-08) many Afghans got off with only having to pay Barkat Khan at 12 annas per rifle. Barkat Khan is also charging Rs. 1 - 6-0 for his own share this year, butheis not demanding the one cartridge. His brothers—Mir Mustafa Khan and Nue Muhammad—only claimed Re. 1 per rifle as their share last year. Mustafa Khan is also only asking Re. 1 per rifle this year. He hopes to get more trade by under bidding his brother. Afghans who landed their arms last year, west of Chahbar, paid Islam Khan Rs. 2-12-0 and one cartridge per rifle. This did not include boat and guide, but the consignments were small. Afghans who landed their arms east of Cbahbar last year had to pay Mahmud Khan, Mir Ahmad Khan and Jan Muham mad at Rs. 10 per rifle. This included guide and boat hire. These rates were so unfavourable that very few Afghans have employed these three men this year. Jan Muhammad offered to help our men at Rs. 2 per rifle under 2,000 rifles, and at Re. 1 per rifle over 2,000 rifles. The Headmen and Sardars through whose districts the caravans have to pass on their journey inland to Afghanistan areusually given a rifle or two as c bakhshish/ and lor this they supply a few sheep and goats for food and men to show the caravan the road. The Afghans bury a few cheap rifles in Masqat for this purpose. Once in Afghanistan they have to pay nothing. No tolls or duties are levied upon them, and it appears that the hakims and toll collectors do not even dare to levy the usual bribes. I believe, though, that an occasional hakim is presented with a rifle. The Afghan traders themselves say that it cost them Rs. 20 per rifle and its com plement of cartridges by the time they have got to Kabul. This is all expenses including their own food, but naturally this must vary greatly (and in inverse ratio) with the number of rifles they are importing. The examples our men quote are mostly for small traders importing from 200 — 300 rifles. Their expenses per rifle work out as follows Rs. A. p. Paid to Baluch Sardar for help 1 8 0 Paid to boatmen and hire of dhow 1 0 0 Paid to guide 0 8 0 Paid to fitting out camel with saddle, ropes, etc. 1 0 0 Paid to camel driver at Rs. 20 per camel of 20 rifles = 1 0 0 Paid as cost of camel at Rs. 120 to Rs. 160 each carrying 20 rifles =8 0 0 Paid as bribes and minor expenses at Masqat 1 0 0 Paid as bribes to Baluch Sardars inland and Afghan Hakims in rifles, say, at 1 0 0 Per rifle 15 0 0 Supposing that the man has bought 250 rifles, the above charges will come to Rs. 3,750, and at Rs. 20 per rifle it would total Rs. 5,000. This leaves Rs. 1,250 un accounted for. Out of this has to come his journey to Karachi and thence to Gulf ports and his own food on the whole trip. And if i n addition he has had to borrow some of his capital and pay interest, commission, etc.,33 he may well have spent as much as R s . 1,250. The traders say that after deducting their expenses at Rs. 20 per rifle they make a profit of 400 to 450 per cent, on each rifle, and in addition to this they are one camel to the good on each lot of 20 rifles. Answers to miscellaneons questions. These points were not mentioned in the ori ginal instructions given to our men. 1* Last year after the Afghans had their dhow captured by the gunboat at Jashk, they wanted to attack the British Con sulate there. They were dissuaded from this by Mir Barkat Khan (who was running oil their business) as he said be would get into trouble. 2. This year there was no talk of attack ing the Consulate or Telegraph Station, nor ol damaging the telegraph and tele phone lines. 3. The Afghans apparently do not con nect their loss of last year with the Tele graph Department, they think it was en tirely due to the gun-boats. Our men did not hear Mr. New’s name mentioned. From what they saw and heard, the gun-runners considered themselves per fectly safe when once they had landed their arms on the Persian coast. 4. Our men heard and saw nothing of dhows flying the French flag. The Sultan of Masqat is reported to have 5. Neither Afghans nor Masqat mer- bought recently six cannons for his own use. chants men ti 0 ned Orders for caDDOn or machine guns. 6. The Afghans have no system of espionage on the Navy. The nakhudas do whatever there is to be done in this line. They seem to be quite confident of giving the gun-boats the slip. 7. The Afghans say that they mean to fight hard if the gun-boats attack them. They hear that in last year’s fight thjir Mauser bullets went through the side of the gun-boats, and they now think that they will be able to do a lot of damage to the crews.As far as our men could discover none of this goes on on at all a large scale. It appears that a few revolvers are smug gled over on the person or in traveller’s kit and bedding, and that this is not very difficult to do. Our men, who were both Pathans and who were not known to the Customs people or Police at Karachi, did not have their kit searched. One of our men had a sword and a dagger in his bedding, and these were not noticed. Formerly a considerable number of cartridges were smuggled across to Bom bay and Karachi in date packages, but since one man was discovered and im prisoned less of this has gon3 on. A man who keeps a fancy goods shop at Masqat named Jahfur, son of Nur Muham mad of Karachi, says that he often takes one or two revolvers with him when he goes to Karachi, and that he can do this without any difficulty. Our man met a man, Hakim Taj Muham mad, Baluchi, at Gwadar. This man had been 18 years at Karachi, where he had served as a Head Constable in the Railway Police, and was for a long time in the employ of the Civil Surgeon. He said that in Karachi he could buy any kind of pistol he wanted to from the British Gunners there. (I suppose they bought for him at Haji Dosul or some other gun-shop). 'He recommended our man to go to his brother Dilshad at Juna Dhobi Ghat, Karachi, if he wanted anything in this line.41 Routes taken by Afghans to the Gulf. Money, how raised- A Participation of Amir- REPORT OF SECRET AGENT “ E.” Afghan Arms trade in the Gulf. 1 . By far the larger number of traders reach the Gulf ports by sea from Karachi and Bombay. Of the Afghan traders nearly all are Ghilzais of the Kharoti, Nasir, Sulaiman Khel sections and some of the Niazi tribe. These men are traders by profes sion and have taken to gun-running as the most profitable line of business. Many of these men have traded regularly with Bandar Abbas for many years, there be ing an export of cctton, wool, etc., from Afghanistan to that port. Now that they have taken to the arms trade these men send their cam-els and servants overland to Bandar Abbas loaded with ordinary merchandise, while they themselves go round by sea. They rejoin their camels at Bandar Abbas, and bring them down the coast to the ports where rifles are dis embarked. However, the majority of Afghan arms traders make no overland arrangements. They book from Karachi and rely upon being able to buy camels at Bandar Abbas. Good Herati camels are sold at from R,s. 2o0—350—Kabuli. The Adam Khel and other frontier tribes all buy their camels at Bandar Abbss. 2. The Ghilzais take most of their money in notes. They combine among them selves to collect their capital, and they also borrow from their own people at interest. None of the men he was associated with had borrowed from Hindus in Bri tish Territory, and the same applies to Adam Khel. 3. Influential men and merchants of standing can borrow from the Amir. He does not take interest, but he requires them to collect a considerable party of men to trade, and he also lays down in what district he wants them to sell the rifles. For instance, Aupo and Muhammad Jan, Nasirs, were lent Rs. 50,000 (Kabuli) by the Amir, and they are to sell in Herat and Afghan Turkistan. Last year Shah I4I.B.42 Dad, Dadar tribe, got money from the Amir and bought Rs. 1 , 20,000 worth oh rifles. This year Shah Dad had a dispute with Rarkat Khan about his commission. Barkat Khan showed Shah Dad a letter which he said was from the Amir, and told him that if he did not pay the Amir would take it from him at Kabul and send it to him (Barkat Khan). Also Ali Khan bin Musa Khan of Masqat had a letter from the Amir asking him to give credit as far as he could to people whom he con sidered trustworthy. Ali Khan let Janai, Niazi, have 220 rifles this year on credit. (Janai was the man who lost heavily when the dhow was captured last year.) (Again this year Janai lost his 220 rifles, and, in addition to this, 200 rifles which he was taking across to sell for Ali Khan.) He says that as far as he knows neither the Amir nor Nasrulla are buying for themselves. They only exercise a bene volent supervision over the trade and indi cate the special markets to be exploited. 4. There is no difficulty at Karachi. The Arrangements at Karachi. Afghans take care to separate into small parties, and they keep quiet in different serais until it is time for them to be medi cally inspected before going on board. Practically no enquiries were made by police or port officials, and these are easily answered by saying that they are going to Karbala or Baghdad. 5. Nearh all the Afghans book to Ban- Movements of Afghans after leaving Karachi, dar Abbas. They are frightened of being followed by spies if they disembark at Jashk. The people of the party our man was with, who were selected to do the purchas- ing, got out at Gwadar. Time men had been there the year before, and they said that they would have to go 3 days’ march up the coast, and they then would get a boat to cross over to Masqat in. This arrangement did not work this year, and they had to re-embark at Chahbar. Two of them, by bribing the port officials with R s . 30, managed to disembark at JV asqat, and the rest got out at Jashk. The43 rest of his party went straight to Bandar Ah- bas. There, as soon as they got out of the quarantine, they went and bought camels from Kharotis, and they left at once down the coast and marched slowly to Zaravat, stopping in places where the grazing was good. They sat quietly at Zaravat un til the rest of their arrangements matured. * (Our man did not go to Masqat himself.) To return now of the actua] purchaser* As mentioned above some of these men manage to land direct at Masqat by brib ing. Most of them, though, have to land on the Makran Coast, and then cross by dhow to Masqat and its vicinity. At Masqat they usually lie up in the hills or stay with the arms dealers and only come into the town at night. They fall in with the native touts of the gun merchants and they are taken to the merchants’ houses. The merchants show them samples of rifles, pistols and ammunition. They give their orders and pay the money. Negotia tions usually take several days. Also the merchants will make all arrange ments for shipping the arms, hiring the boats and deciding where they will try to t That is to say if this has not already been land on the Persian Coastf. In many cases aone by one of the Baluch Sirdars. (this occurred with his own party), the Afghans paid the money over to the mer chants who promised to try to get the rifles across in so many days to such and such places, and the Afghans crossed over ahead without any rifles on board. This year some of the Masqat merchants allowed their old customers to have a certain number of rifles on credit. Arrived on the Makran Coast they found out from the local Baluchis where the camels were lying up. One or two men went off to get in touch with the rest of their party, and the remainder stayed on the coast at the points where the rifles were expected. If none of the Afghan purchasers accom pany the rifles in the dhows, then the Masqat merchants give the naJchudas a list of the owners and the numbers of their44 several consignments. As soon as they reach the Makran Coast they show their papers to Earkat Khan, or one of the other Baluch Sardars, and lie at once informs the owners The dhows are unloaded at once. If the owners and camels are on the spot the rifles are taken off immediately to their lying up place, and if the owners are not present they are stored in the nearest villagei, As the actual landing place depends on v ind, tide, gun-boats, etc., it frequently happens that the rifles are landed many miles up or down the coast from where they were expected. All difficulty and risk of loss is prevented, by the assistance at once rendered by the Baluch Sardars. 6 . As mentioned above, Afghans who have gone direct to Masqat without enlist ing the help of one of the Baluch Sardars can hue their boats and make all other arrange ments for the crossing through the Masqat merchants. However, the majority em ploy the Bduch Sardars, and in any care the help of the latter men will be necessary when once the rifles have reached the Makran Coast. The Afghans usually have to make a separate payment for the hire of a boat from the Makran Coast to Masqat. The ordinary hire isRs. 120 for this single journey. For the return journey with arms the usual charge is Re. 1 per rifle. Owners of small consignments of arms may have to pay more if they are not prepared to wait for the full cargo to be made up with other peo ple’s purchases. Sometimes the nakhudas make up the full freight with other goods. The Masqat merchants make the same charge of Re. 1 per rifle when dhows are arranged through them. Arab nakhudas are to be found willing to take arms at 8 annas per rifle, but they are not considered reliable, and the Afghans prefer to deal with the rtakhudas from the Makran side over whom, through the Baluch Sardars, they have much more control. Pistols are usually shipped free if in small proportion to the number of rifles. This is Hire of Boats.45 Baluch Sirdar. also the case with ammunition, unless large extra supplies of cartridges are being taken. As many as 1,500 rifles are sometimes car ried in one dhow. The usual number is 1,000 rifles with a proportionate quantity of ammunition. The nakhudas when they have arms on board generally sail up the Batinah coast and then seize a favourable opportunity for making a dash across the Gulf at night. There is a considerable trade up and down the coast, as well as from one shore to the other, and the nakhudas get good information given them as to the whereabouts and movements of gun-boats by the skippers of other boats. Cases oc curred this year where Arab nakhudas, bringing over rifles without their owners, secretly deposited 30 or 40 rifles in their homes on the Arab Coast, so as to insure themselves against eventual loss if their dhows were captured by our gun-boats. After getting the rifles safely across, they went back for the remainder. The trade was at its busiest early in March and it appears that some method was adhered to in shipping the arms across. The Masqat merchants would not let the dhows straggle across as they liked, but they were kept collected along the Batinah coast, and two or three started off at a time. As soon as their arrival was safely reported, the next party made a dash for it. The dhows were mostly obtained from Bunji. The following are some of the principal nakhudas :— Ibrahim, Ba’.uch of Bunji (ho brought across 3,000 rifles, while our man was th re). Mad Ghu'.am „ (brought over 2,600 rifle*). Muhammad Wali „ »* Jafar *&gt; ” Mulla »» ” Khudadid »&gt; »» Haji » ” Yusuf »» ” 7 . Our man was attached to a party which remained at Zaravat and Jashk, and which landed their arms at Bunji. H e consequent ly only came in contact with Barkat Khan. 14 LB.46 Again this year this man seems to be taking the leading part among the Baluch Sardars. Nearly all the Afghans are deal ing with him, and he must be making large profits. At the same time he certainly renders great services, and without his ac tive help and goodwill the Afghans would find the trade much more difficult and risky. Barkat Khan received for the first con signments that were landed this year Re. 1-6 per rifle. This is for his personal services, and does not include hire of boat or pay of guide, if provided, and out of which he no doubt makes a separate commission. The later arrivals refused to pay more than Re. 1 per rifle, and after some discus sion Barkat Khan agreed to this. He has two agents who do most of the work for him. These are Dadulla and Dosti, both Baluchis. As w T as mentioned above, Barkat Khan appears to have been given a firman by the Amir. 8 . Zaravat was selected as the final ren dezvous for the large caravan. This place is about 30 miles, north-west of Jashk, on the road to Minab. It is quite close to Agushki and Shirahan. It was selected on account of the good camel-grazing to be got there, and also because it was considered a safe and secluded spot. The various parties of Afghans had been slowly collecting there for some three mor ths. It had become a regular Afghan colony by the middle of March. New arrivals were coming in daily, and all were very pleased with them selves. Those whose purchases had all arrived busied themselves wuth clean ing and packing up their rifles, they were also continually testing their rifles. Our man says it w r as as though field firing was going on. Many of the Afghans had used up their allowance of cartridges, and in many cases the owners of Mauser pistols had fired away all their 400 rounds. All had assembled by the afternoon of the 20th March, and the caravan started on the morning of the 21st March. Rendezvous.47 Men who had landed their arms at Gabrig and elsewhere, east of Jashk, had all ren dezvoused at Zara vat. Our man knows that two boat loads were left behind, as the caravan refused to delay any longer, but, excepting these, he believes that the trade is over for the season. The caravan. 9 . The caravan consisted of 1,100 camels accompanied by about 400 men. Alto gether there were about 700 Afghans and frontier tribesman collected at Zaravat, but 300 of these are returning by sea. 20 rifles with a proportional amount of ammu nition (100 rounds for single loading and 400 rounds for magazine rifles) is the ordi nary load per camel. But each man had arranged to carry 1 J maunds of flour and a 4 days’ supply of water in a mussak, this and a certain amount of kit reduces the average number of rifles to about 16 per camel. As some of the Afghans had pur chased extra amounts of ammunition and a considerable number of pistols, our man makes a further reduction on this account, and calculates the total number of rifles at 16,000 'flus about 2,000 pistols. As regards the rifles I think this may be looked upon as a moderate estimate, and the number is not likely to be less than this. He divides'this number up into— 6.000 Martini-Henri rifles and carbines. 5.000 Martini-Metford rifles and carbines. 5,000 Rifles of the Snider era. These are old cheap rifles, probably Gras and Werndl. In addition to the above he knows of 50 magazine rifles, 5 shot Mausers and Mannlichers. He estimates the number of pistols at 2,000 (mostly Mauser). The caravan is going to march from Zaravat by route No. 8 (green pamphlet) crossing the Persian-Afghan frontier at Sar-i-Shela, which they hope to reach in about 50 days. They originally intended to march via Bazman, but this plan was afterwards dropped, as it was not considered as safe as that now taken.48 They were frightened of passing too close to Robat, and they also wished to keep clear of the telegraph line. Attempts on the part of the Persian Gov ernment to interfere with the march of the kafilehs is neither anticipated nor fear- ed. Caution is only observed while pass ing through Sistan, where opposition by British forces is thought possible. Their spies precede the caravan by about four days and give warning of any danger. Each man with the caravan keeps out a good rifle and plenty of ammunition in case of emergencies on the road.

Feeling against British officials- Rifles and Prices- * British Government pattern usually marked N. S. W. by flic Afridis. The cheap rifles were pur chased by the Afghans, the Afridis would not look at them. Most of these will probably be sold in Herat and Afghan Turkistan. 10. It appears that very little of this year’s trade will go to Kabul, which is fairly well stocked. Jan Muhammad, son of Nurakai, and the Adam Khel, will bring their rifles to the Peshawar border via Kabul, but the bulk of the Af ghan trade will go to Herat, Afghan Turkistan, Ghazni, Urghun, and the Khost and Jadran border. Aupo, Ahmad Jan, Naibat Khan, Ab dulla Khan (Kandahari) are all big mer chants who are going to take their rifles to Herat by the Amir’s orders. They own at least 3,000 rifles. The Kabul market seems to be well-stocked, and the best prices are not to be expected there. 11. There seems to be no intention on the part of the Afghans to take any revenge on our officials in south-east Persia for previous losses and attempts to interfere with their trade. Their main desire is to get their arms in Afghanistan with as little trouble as possible. They seem to look upon the losses caused by gun-boats as all in the day’s work, and they are prepared to take this fair sporting risk. The Afghans said that, if we stopped them from booking at Karachi and Bombay and forced them to go all the way round by land, then they would attack our telegraph station at Jashk. 12.

Two Arab-owned dhows were crossing over from Batinah to Bunji. A storm arose in the night, and very early in the morning they found themselves opposite the European holdings at Jashk and in close proximity to the gun-boats. The larger of the two dhows had one Afghan, Shah Dad, and nine Arab sailors on board.f The Arabs wanted to throw the rifles over board but Shah Dad threat ened to shoot them all and got them to make a bolt for it down the coast while it was still dark. This they did, and they drew the boat up in a small creek three miles below Jashk and, sending to Barkat Khan for men, they unloaded the arms there and stored them within 60 yards of the shore. They remained here three days with Shah Dad keeping watch over them until camels arrived from Zara vat. It was said that the Customs sent camels to take the rifles away, but Shah Dad fired on them and they fled. * Tor = black. Wakhai = band (or rin^). Zer = yellow. Probably an 11 mm.

The second dhow was captured near Bunji. It is said that it contained 1,500 rifles. Among these w^ere 220 rifles given to Janai on credit by Ali Khan bin Musa Khan.51 Absentees from main caravan- 14. Of the two boats that were too late for the caravan, one boat was known to have landed at Gabrig just as the caravan was starting. The second boat with rifles purchased by Kharotis and Sulaiman Khel was delayed at Masqat. The caravan, would not wait any longer for these, as they had already been col lected some time, and they said that the hot weather was upon them. The owners of these two boat loads have remained behind. Masqat merchants- 15. Most of the Afridis and Afghans have traded with the following mer chants :— Ali Khan bin Musa Khan. Ibrahim. Goguyer. Trade prospects, seasons, 1908*09 and 1909-10- 16. Not so many rifles were bought this year as last, partly because prices have dropped in Afghanistan and partly because they could not get enough of their favourite “ Tajdar” rifles. Orders for these for next year have been placed with the merchants at Masqat. A large number of extra cartridges have been bought this year. Many Afghans and Adam Khel bought 4,000 or 5,000 extra rounds. The proportion of cartridges is likely to be greatly increased next year. The Afghans are making plans for going again next year. The Kharotis said that they intended to go very early, before the end of this hot weather. They would thus get the pick of the market, and would be able to ship their arms across the Gulf with little risk, as the gun-boats would not be on the look-out at that time of year. They would store their rifles with the local Baluchis until the next caravan Local Trade- season. The traders are expecting to make 200 per cent, net profit this year. 17. No rifles were sold locally in Makran or Persia. The Baluchis on the coast all had their private rifles, and they do not do any trade with the Afghans. The few rifles that they had for sale were of52 bad quality and were priced high. The Afghans tried to dispose locally of some rifles that had got damaged by sea water. 18. There was no mention of Afghans buying machine guns or small cannon. 19. He neither heard of nor saw any dhows flying the French flag. Cannon-British Makran, landing of arms in- 53 REPORT OF SECRET AGENT “C.” Landing at Pasni this man worked along the coast to Gwadar. Until he reached Gwadar he could hear nothing of any landing of arms. The precautions taken by our politicals along the coast of British Makran appear to be good, and the difficulty and risk of getting the rifles away inland seem to have discouraged gun-runners from making the attempt. No doubt the smuggling of a few rifles and pistols and such like operations on a very small scale do take place, but no definite information to this effect was ob tained. The first signs of any landing of arms were noted at Gwadar. Here, there is a cloth merchant, one Mul- la Bahram, son of Mulla Jumaat, who is secretly employed by Mulla Abdirr Rahim, to smuggle rifles. Abdur Rahim is believed to be in the employ of the Indo-Persian Tele graphs (not in his capacity of smuggler!). The way Abdur Rahim works is that, when the Wali of Gwadar goes over to Masqat, he or one of his men follows him there. He buys a few rifles and hands them over to the servants of the Wali. As these men are not inspected by the Customs, they can land the rifles at Gwadar to hand them over to Mulla Bahram. There are also a few Hindu shopkeepers at Gwadar who offered to sell our man one or two rifles. Presumably they get their rifles across by similar means, but this smuggling is only on a small scale. Gwadar is not used as a landing place for rifles as, although it may be possible to get them ashore there, there are no means of getting them away from the place. East of Gwatar (between Jini and Gwatar) there is a small place called Sukkur. While at Gwatar our man heard that on 23th February 1909 one Abdulla, son of Din Muhammad, Dewari Baluch of Kila Nasari near Dizak, landed 800 rifles and 9 boxes 14 I.B.54 of ammunition here. He managed to get them safely away to Bakhu Kalat where Mir Nawab Khan (Hakim or Sirdar) took 6 rifles and 1,200 rounds as his commission. Abdulla was acting as agent for Din Mu hammad, Mahi Khel Afghan, who gave him Re. 1 per rifle landed. This was the only case our man heard of any large consignment of arms being landed w.thin British territory. In the report of secret agent E it is stated that Mulla Isa of Sur is secretly engaged in the arms trade. The present agent denies this, and as he was in a better position to judge than they were, I am inclined to accept his statement. Jalal Khan Hakim, of Gwatar, appears Persian Makran. to be somewhat obstructive to the gun runners, but from our man’s report it is not clear whether this is from a sense of duty, or whether his own demands are too exhorbitant—probably the latter. In December 1903 some Baluchis landed 400 rifles near Pasa Bandar. Jalal Khan tried to stop them, and only let them go after they had given him 12 rifbs and 600 cartridges. The boat, in which the arms were brought across, belonging to Sol Mu hammad, was confiscated. From Gwatar our man worked up along the coast to Jashk. The landings which he saw or heard of are given in the tables at the end of the report. Mahmud Khan of Dashtiari is an active Agents and men who help the gun-runners- helper of the Afghans. His methods are the same as Barkat Khan’s (vide former reports). At Dizah Mir Bahram Khan and his brother Mir Ali Muhammad Khan, Now- sherwans. At Baku Kalat.

These were Khuda Dost, Nur Mu hammad, Jan Muhammad, Alidad and two others. These men had given Rs. 4,000 to Barkat Khan, who will purchase rifles for them now and store them for them until next season. Two of the above-mentioned Afghans intended to stay through the hot weather with Khalifa Khair Muhammad, and the others were going to return by ship to Karachi. He also heard that there were still some 15 Afghans at Minab. According to what he heard it appears that the Afghans who landed their arms even as far east as Pasa Bandar all made their way up the coast and joined the main caravan at Biaban. He heard nothing of any smaller caravans taking a more easterly route, but it seems probable that the Afghans, who were working from Dizak as a base, managed to get their rifles across the Afghan border independent ly- He beard at Jashk from some of Mir Mustafa Khan's men that a second caravan, consisting of 50 men and 100 camels, with Niaz Muhammad, Niazai, as headman, left Jaghin on 15th April. His informants said that th's caravan was going to follow the Rodan (Rigan ?) route. This is the only information any of our men have given of a second caravan, and as this is only hearsay evidence it cannot be con sidered thoroughly reliable. It seems pro bable that there would have been a second caravan judging by the number of rifles56 landed late in March and early in April which were al) too late for the big caravan. The information is important if true, and it should be possible to» verify it from Mr. News’ reports. It the caravan existed, and if it contained 100 camels, this would probably mean about 2,000 rifles. He gives the description and marks of pattern ot rifles, several rifles seen on the Makran Coast. These were mostly Martini-Henrys, including the Peabody rifle; the Gras; the Mauser, one AVinchester repeater; Mauser and Browning pistols. The descriptions and prices he gives agree exactly with those given in Secret Agent “A” ’s report (vide his types of rifle Nos. 5, 13, 34, 41, 42 and 43), and I have not considered it necessary to give them a second time.

REPORT OF SECRET AGENTS B. ” AND “ D.” Pathans travelling either up or down the Gulf manage to land at Masqat direct from the steamer in one of the following ways. At Bombay or Karachi, if they can disguise the fact that they are Pathanj and can pass themselves off as Panjab b or Hindustanis, they can book direct to Masqat. This is not very difficult. Our two men, who are both Pathans, w r ore Pan jabi clothes, and without disclosing the fact that they were travelling on Government duty took tickets to Masqat without ques tions being raised. When the steamer reaches Masqat the quarantine doctor with his native assistant and some chaprassis comes on board. He is given a list of the native passengers to Masqat, and they are taken off to four days’ quarantine by the native assistant. At the present time this man is one iSaivid Mukhdum Shah, and he Las dis covered many ways of turning the quaran tine regulations and the gun-trade to his own advantage. If made worth his while he will allow natives who are supposed to be in quarantine to go off for three days, and they put in an appearance on the afternoon of the fourth just in time for the final inspection by the British doctor. He also takes advantage of the fact that the quarantine staff are the only Government officials on the spot who could possibly make things objectionable for any Pathans trying to land. Mukhdum Shah at once re cognised agent “D” as a Pathan, and threat ened to report him unless squared. Rs. 20 to Mukhdum Shah and Rs. 3 to each cliap- rassi smoothed the way, and no more ques tions were asked. Many other Pathans who have booked to other ports also manage to land at Masqat. As soon as the steamer comes to anchor there it is at once surrounded by a lot of small boats. Gun merchants’ touts come on board from them, and they and the native quarantine officials wander about among the native passengers look- in» for likely Pathans. They quietly60 appfcaob individuals, and ask them if they would like to land. This ran be a'uv.nge- ed for a consideration, varying from Es. 5 to Rs. 40 according to the substance of the ir.dividua 1. The bargain made, the man shoulders his kit, walks down the ladder into a bo.t and is taken off to Matrah. On the 2ith March, 21 Af ghans who came from Bandar Abbas by steamer managed to land at Masqat by paying Rs. 200 in bribes to quarantine and other officials. The ship’s officers apparently take no notice of this, and the only official who could make things un pleasant is the quarantine assistant. He has either been bribed directly or, if arrang ed through the touts, he gets his commis sion from them. Mukhdum Shah’s activities do not end on board the steamer. He has built a guest hou'e at Matrah, and he takes the Pathans, who have secretly land ed, off to this. Here he has samples of rifles that are for sale in Masqat, and he persuades hi] Pathan guests to deal with whichever merchant pays him the most commission. It will be seer* that he is verv favour ably situated. He is the only native with any official position on the spot, and he is the first in the field. In addition to building this house at Matrah, he is believed to have saved up 5,000 reals in cash out of the business. The quarantine chaprassis and the touts * . „ 1 * tuuts s , ning of p j s(ols on board steamers manage to sell a certain number of pis tols to Afghan passengers on board the India-bound ships. The Afghans con ceal the.e in their trousers and land thus at Karachi, where only the kit and not the person is searched. In addition to the above there are other • methods of smuggling arms into Bom bay and Karachi. The gun merchant, Damodar Mul, does a large trade in dates and dried fish (for manure) between Masqat and Bombay and Karachi. Ali Khan bin Musa Khan* and Saiyid lusuf give pistols and ammunition to the nahhudas of Damodar Mul’s boats smuggling arms into India- * Afterwards ererced to in this report as A!i Musa61 (it is not known whether Damodar Mul ♦ •Iso does tliis), and these are hidden nnder the boarding of the boats. When the boats arrive at Karachi or Bombay the dates and dried fish are taken off to the Customs, and the seeminedy empty boats remain at or near the wharf. After a few days, when no suspicion is likely to be excited, men come down and carry off the pistols. The names of the men in Karachi wdio take over the pistols are not known, but they live in the Karadar quarter of the city. In Bombay the places are the Ali Chakla and Mandawar quarters, and the name of one of the recipients is believed to be Hasim Banda Ali. It is expected that this trade will be brisk in August and September, which is the date and dried-fish season. Another scheme is to put pistols and ammunition into kerosine oil tins and solder the top on again. The tins are then packed in wmoden packing cases. When the boat gets to Karachi, and just before reaching the wharf, a chain or rope is fixed to the case, and this is lowered into the water and the chain fastened to a ring somewhere below the side of the boat. When a convenient opportunity offers the cases are pulled up and the pistol disposed of. A good number of pistols are taken over to Persia by Baluchis concealed on their persons. The Muhammareh Arab horse dealers buy rifles and pistols at Alasqat, and they conceal pistols in the grain or horses’ nose bags and rifles in the fodder, and thus get them into Bombay. The gun merchants have now taken to Business enterprise in catching customers. their Agents to Karachi; Chahbar, Jashk and Bandar Abbas. These men take three different sets of clothes with them—Baluchi, Arab and faqir garments —they get to know the Afghans who in tend to go to Masqat, and rig them out with whichever type of garment seems most suitable for each particular cast of 14 I.B.62 countenance. This enables the Afghans to land at Masqat without trouble. All the Masqat gun merchants have large guest houses. Having caught their cus tomers they lodge and feed them through out their stay at Masqat. r I his is to prevent Afghans from being seen wandering about the streets and also to prevent them from approaching other firms. Afghans are not to be seen in the Masqat st eets, they all remain shut up in the houses. The Afghans and Baluchis mostly hire their boats on the Makran coast. They generally land at or above Mafcrah. The Masqat merchants are also prepared to make all arrangements for hire of boats. Dhunjee Mararji, gun merchant, owns 3 £ bagalas’—(a type of boat) which he hires out for gun-running. On the Masqat side the rate charged is one real (Rs. 1 - 5 - 0 ) per rifle, on the Makran coast the rate is Re. 1. The loading of rifles into small boats at Masqat is done quite openly, nobody knows where they are bound for, and the merchants declare them for Kuwait. This goes on just below the palace. The small boats then go to Matrah where the sailing boats usually lie up. From here they usually work up the Batinah coast, and then make a dash for the Makran side. With a favourable wind boats can cross in one night. Those who intend to land further down the M kran Coast at Chahbar, etc., usually work down the Arab Coast to Sur and then bolt across. The gun merchants have to give a week ly return of arms they have received and sold to their respective Consulates. In these returns they show Afghans and Baluchis as Arabs. With reference to the trade in 1907-08 the Masqat merchants say that the Af ghans bought about Rs. 9,00,000 of rifles and ammunition, and they calculate the number of rifles bought by Afghans and frontier Pathans at 30,000. The C iibtoms people also put down the num ber at this. Hire of boats. Falsification of returns. The 1907-08 trade-63 Change of venue from Jashk to Chahbar. Facilities for buying on Makran coast. * April 1909. This is only for the direct Afghans trade, and does not include the rifles brought by Baluchis and afterwards sold to Afghans. After the capture of the second dhow the Afghans began to get nervous of the Batinah-Jashk crossing, also Bandar Abbas, and Jasbk were in a disturbed state owing to the Persian revolution. These facts decided the Afghans to change the venue of their operations to Chahbar. Nearly all the business that is now going on is based on this place. Towards the end of April the Sultan of Masqat also issued an order to the gun merchants that they were to discourage the Afghans from coming to Masqat, but that in future they should arrange to send their rifles to the Makran Coast for sale. This is now being done. The gun mer chants—especially Ali Musa, Harun and Saivid Yusuf—are sending their agents across to the Makran Coast with rifles for sale. They have to come to an arrangement with the local Baluch Hakims or Sardars before they can do this. In some cases the Afghans are entrusting their money to Baluchis, working through the Hakims, and these Baluchis cross over to Masqat and purchase for the Afghans there. In some cases Baluch capitalists buy for themselves at Masqat and retail to Afghans on the Makran Coast. Rifles are naturally more expensive on the Makran Coast, and a Martini-Henry which is priced Rs. 40 at Masqat will fetch Rs. 60 on this side. Saravan, Sarbaz, Dizak, Dashtiari are becoming centres for the sale of rifles. Our men think that there are still* a good many Afghans hanging about the Makran Coast near Chahbar. They will buy rifles bv one of the above-mentioned methods, and they will store them locally until next caravan season. They have heard of rifles being thus stored with Khalifa Khair Muhammad at Karvan and with Mahmud Khan of Dashtiari.64 On the 13th April Mahmud Khan, Hakim of Dashtiari, sent over six Baluchis to Mas qat to inform the merchants that a party of 30 Afghans were with him, and asking them to send over 1,000 rifles.

These men receive about 2 to 4 annas from the merchants for every rifle sold through their instrumentality. (1) Muhammad Rahim, Khoja of Gwa dar, owns many “ bagalas ” (boats) at Jashk, Chahbar and Pasni. He brings ghi, matting, dates and cotton to Matrah. These he sells to Saiyid Yusuf and Damodar Mul, and takes back rifles to the Makran Coast. (2) Abdur Rahim, Baluch Native Assist ant at Gwadar, takes an interest in the arms trade and makes what he can out of it. Haji Najaf of Bushire does a large trade in rifles apparently with Persians. He used to buy his rifles from Ali Musa, but he now has his own agent at Masqat who orders direct from Europe. From Mas qat his rifles are first shipped to Kuwait, and are then taken over to Bushire. These are not landed actually on the peninsula, but at various small ports on the coast of Tangistan. Shaikh Khazal of Muhammareh, about 8 months ago, sent a large tent, a jewel stud ded sword and two horses as presents to the Sultan of Masqat. He asked that a free trade in arms might be allowed between the two countries. Shaikh Mukaddam of Dibai has also approached the Sultan of Masqat in the same sense. French — Gun merchants at Masqat.

These were some of the men who came over to Masqat, but in addition to them the rifles also belonged to the follow ing men who remained on the Persian coast:—Mauladad, Musa, Paigor, Afzal Khan, and Abdul Karim. Whenever Baluch Sardars cross to Masqat they are well entertained by the Sultan, and on their departure he usually gives each of them a good rifle as a personal present and a cheap rifle to each of their servants. When Barkat Khan came over in March the Sultan gave him 6 Martini- Henry rifles. The Sultan wishes to en courage the Sardars who help the Afghan gun merchants. At Sur, the port on the Arab Coast below Masqat, a very large type of bagala is kept. The owners of these mainly trade in dates and dred fish from Masqat and rice from Bombay. Their boats can carry 3,000 sacks as cargo. Many of these men sell a portion of their cargo at Masqat and buy rifles, which they take over to the African coast. Our men heard that they trade with Zanzibar and the Somali coast and also with the Aaman. When in fear of being searched they fly the French flag. At Masqat they generally deal with Jai Ram, bunia, who is one of Damodar’s agents. The Arab trade was very slack at this time of year. Only a few individuals were coming into Masqat and taking off 2 or 3 rifles. The Arab trade is brisk during the date season. They appa rently make their livelihood out of dates, and at this time of year they come in large numbers by sea with boat loads of dates. They dispose of these and buy rifles. They take away rifles openly from Masqat. They mostly go to Kuwait or Dibai, and from there the rifles are sold into the interior; a good many also find their way over to Persia. Our men beheve that the Arab trade is bigger than68 the Afghan trade. The Arabs do not take any rifles away overland. The immedi ate hinterland of Masqat appears to be a dangerous neighbourhood, and they are afraid of being looted. As mentioned under “ African trade ” the people of Sur do most of the trade with the Southern Arabian ports. In this direction, too, there is little trade until July and August. The favourite rifle with the Arabs is a short M.-H. rifle (or carbine), in which the wood does not come to the end of the barrel. These rifles are priced at Rs. 22 with 100 cartridges. It is not a good rifle. A similar rifle to the above with regard to length and make, is the Martini-Metford, priced at Rs. 40. This is also a favourite with the Arabs. A large share of the Arab trade falls to Damodar Mul. About 8 months ago Habib-bin-Salin, Suspected German enterprise, an Arab, brought some German tele phones and lamps valued at Rs. 30,000 as presents to the Sultm of Masqat. He was expected at Masqat again on 25th April with a motor car and motor boat which are believed to be presents from Germany. He is coming from Mom basa in the Sultan’s yacht “Nur-ul-Bahar.” About 40 yeais ago Habib lived at Masqat The merchants there say that he is a poor man, and that he could never afford to give presents on this scale, and they think that Germany is trying to get round the Sultan of Masqat, in order to increase her influence and obtain a Consulate there. Our men think that the Masqat mer chants and the Baluchis will be busy sending across rifles to the Makran Coast all this summer. There are also still a considerable number of Afghans hanging about the Gulf, and they will certainly try to make their purchases early. Tbev will stoie their rifles with Baluch Sardars along the Makran coast until the next caravan season, while the Masqat mer chants and Baluchis will collect rifles on Plans for next season. This is confirmed by our other reports which all prediot a busy hot weather and an early season.69 This year’s trade, 1908*09- Correction. Suggestions. 14 LB. that coast ready for the Afghan rush in the autumn. At the present moment the greatest activity seems to be in the vicinity of Chahbar, but this is liable to be changed according to circumstances. (When the first party of our men went to the Gulf early in December, Gabiig and other landing places, east of Jashk, were popular. Possibly, owing to the watch fulness of our gun-boats, this was chang ed to Bunji and other places, west of Jashk, in February and March. Then, owing to Persian disturbances and the capture of two dhows, the popular centre was shift ed to Chahbar in April.) It certainly appears that much fewer Afghans will personally purchase in Mas qat during the next season. The Sultan’s order regarding this has already been mentioned, and it appears that he is a little nervous of being called to book. When he heard that Major Cox was coming to Masqat he went off to Sib, possibly to avoid meeting him. See lists marked A, B, C, D, which give the consignments personally seen or lizard of by our agents. They represent, of course, only a paction of the whole trad'\ These give the following totals :— (a) For shipments from Masqat in time to join the big caravan of March 1909-- Shipped by Pathans—4,236 rifles. Shipped by Baluchis—871 = 5,107 (b) For shipments from Masqat too late for the big caravan— Shipped by Pathans—-1,500 Shipped by Baluchis—4,745= 6,245 11,352 Nearly all the Pathans who proceeded to the Gulf to purchase rifles pass them selves off as pilgrims going to Baghdad and Karbala. Our men think that it would be an excellent measure to insist on all Pathans travelling to the Gulf being provided with a Rahdari (passport or certificate of iden tification) without which they would not be allowed to purchase steamer tickets. This would certainly have an excellent effect on men of our politically controlled70 tribes, whom we may expect to see going to the Gulf in increasing numbers every year. It would also be a deterrent to the Afghans, if the difficulty as to who should be the issuing authority can be overcome. Like the first two men we sent Out Laxity of Karachi Customs, these men lay great stress on the laxity of the Custom’s inspection of passengers returning to Karachi. A very casual examination of kit is performed, but there is no search of the person. One of our men brought over a Browning pistol which he smuggled through without the least difficulty. In the first part of the report mention is made of the smug gling over of pistols, especially Mausers, and, bearing in mind the voluminous nether garments worn by the Pathan and Baluch, it will readily be seen that their carrying—and concealing—capacity is great.'aders wk arrived at Masqat while our men were there.
