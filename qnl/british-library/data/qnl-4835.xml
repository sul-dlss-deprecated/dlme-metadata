Copies of the texts of these instruments have been furnished to me by the French Ambassador. 2. So far as the interests of British subjects are concerned, it will be observed that the second exchange of letters between M. Siikru Saracoglu and M. Massigli places on record the decision of the Turkish Government to accord on request to foreign persons and companies established in the Hatay the same facilities for the export of foreign currency and of the proceeds in Turkish currency of their property as are secured by article 4 of the main agreement and by the proces-verbal to persons opting for Syrian or Lebanese nationality. A further point of interest is that the Turkish Government have agreed by the former exchange of letters to recognise as valid the contract for archaeological research in the Hatay granted on the^st October, 1936, to the British Museum. 3.

[E 54)78/29/89 Consul Davis to Viscount Halifax.—(Received September 19.) (No. 42.) My Lord, Aleppo, September 9, 1938. WITH reference to my telegram No. 5, Saving of the 2nd September, 1938, I have the honour to report that I was present with Mr. Vice-Consul Catoni at the inauguration of the First Parliament of the Sanjak of Alexandretta, which took place at Antioch on that date. In the absence of a special building for the Assembly, its first meeting was held in the local cinema, which had been specially decorated and illuminated for the occasion. The whole town of Antioch, and, indeed, the whole sanjak, was en fete for the day, and every house was plentifully bedecked with Turkish flags, bunting in the red and white Turkish colours, and portraits of Kemal Ataturk and prominent Turkish statesmen. The guest of honour at the opening of the Parliament was his Excellency Cevat Agikalin, Special Envoy of the Turkish Government in the sanjak, who was seated with the Officer Commanding the Turkish Troops on his right and the delegate of the French High Commissioner on his left. The proceedings opened with the playing of the Turkish national anthem, and, in fact, it was hard to realise that we were not on Turkish soil, but in French mandated territory. True, the “ Marseillaise ” was played later, but so unobtrusively that no one paid much attention to it. 2. The Parliament was declared open by Haci Mehmet Adali, Turkish Deputy for Antioch, the oldest member, who took the chair and invited the Assembly to appoint its president, two vice-presidents and two secretaries. Abdulgenni Turkmen, a Turk, was elected as president, one Turk and one Alaouite as vice-presidents, and two Turks as secretaries. Each of these officers was solemnly elected by forty votes to nil, although no other candidates ventured to offer themselves in opposition to the official nominees. The fact that the persons chosen must have voted for themselves did not trouble anybody. From beginning to end the proceedings were entirely in Turkish. The officers elected were then duly installed, and the Deputies took the oath of fidelity to the Constitution, some of them not without difficulty, as they either did not know Turkish or could not read and write. The leader of each community represented in the Assembly then read a speech thanking the President and Government of the Turkish Republic for the efforts they had made, this day crowned with success, to secure for ever the independence of the sanjak. 3. The Assembly then proceeded to designate the President of the Independent Sanjak, a post to which Taifur Bey Sukmen was unanimously elected. 4. A lively discussion arose at this point when one Turkish Deputy rose to ask what was the name of the State of which Taifur Bey had been elected head, what was its flag, and where was its capital. It was noticeable, however, that the discussion was confined to the Turkish Deputies, and that none of the minority members ventured to say a word. These questions were eventually referred to a Select Committee, and the House was thereupon adjourned. 5. Further meetings of the Assembly took place on the 6th and the 7th September, also at Antioch, during which Taifur Bey was installed as President of the Sanjak and took the oath of fidelity to the Constitution, and the following decisions were reached :— (i) The Sanjak of Alexandretta will in future be known as the Republic of Hatay. (ii) The town of Antioch will be the capital and seat of government of the republic. [405 t—2] 6754 , 1958 I September 19. 1938. Section 2. Copy No. 1162 (iii) The flag of the republic shall be the Turkish flag (white crescent and star on a red ground), with a smaller red star superimposed on the white star.

Minister of Justice : Cemil Yurtman. Minister of Finance, Economics and Customs: Cemal Baki. Minister of Public Instruction and Health : Ahmet Faik. Minister of Public Works and Agriculture : Kemal Alpar. All these being Turks, it is to be anticipated that the Turkification of the administration of the sanjak will now proceed apace. 6.

My Lord, Aleppo, August 6, 1938 ; WITH reference to my telegram N o. 3 S aving, of the 19th July, 1938, regarding the elections in the Sanjak of Alexandretta, I have the honour to inform your Lordship that the registration of electors, continued under Iranco- Turkish control from the point at which the League Commission left off, was concluded on Monday last, the 1st August, the number of electors having inscribed themselves as Turks up to that date being sufficient to give the Turkish community twenty-two Deputies out of the total number of forty. 2. The number of Deputies allotted to the various communities in the sanjak has now been revised as follows :— Deputies. Turks ... ... ... ... ... ••• 22 Alawites ... ... ... ... ... ... 9 Armenians ... ... ... ... ... 5 Greek Orthodox ... ... ... ... ... 2 Sunni Arabs ... ... ... ... ... 2 Other minorities ... Total 40 It will be observed that to raise the number of Turkish Deputies from eighteen to twenty-two the twelve Deputies formerly allotted to the Alawites have been reduced to nine, and the one Deputy formerly assigned to the other minorities has been eliminated. 3. Preparations for the second degree elections are now being pressed forward, and it is believed that they will be completed in time to allow the Assembly of the sanjak to hold its first meeting before the end of the current month. With this end in view efforts are being made to induce each of the five communities concerned to submit an agreed list of candidates exactly equal in number to the seats assigned for it, so that the secondary elections will in effect be reduced to the merest formality. The Armenian community has already submitted an agreed list; the other communities will probably submit their lists shortly unless the Turkish community itself fails to achieve unanimity. At the moment it is divided into five contending groups, followers respectively of Dr. Abdurrahman Malak (the present Vali of the Sanjak), Subhi Bey Barakat, Mahomed Bey Adali, Mustafa Bey Kosseiri, and Taifur Bey. The divisions between these groups appear, however, to be rather of a personal than of a political nature. 4.

WITH reference to my despatch No ._27 o f the 21st June, 1938, on the subject of the political situation at Aleppo, I have the honour to report that on Thursday last, the 4th August, the Syrian Prime Minister, Jamil Mardam, paid a visit to Aleppo accompanied by Saadullah Bey-el-Jabri and Dr. Abdurrahman Kayali, the two members of his Cabinet who are natives of Aleppo. 2. Several motives can be surmised to account for this move on the part ol the Prime Minister : in the first place, the recent return to Syria of Dr. Abdurrah man Shahbandar, the real leader of the opposition to the Nationalist bloc, and its possible consequences must be causing him anxiety, the more so as he is on the point of leaving on one of his periodical trips to Paris; in the second place, it must have become necessary to demonstrate to Syria in general and to Aleppo in particular, the unbroken unity of the Nationalist bloc after its iccent congiess at Koudsaya,’ where it was at one stage seriously imperilled by the resignation, subsequently withdrawn, of the two Aleppo members of the Ministry, and m the third place, it must have been felt that the time had come for some mo\e to instil fresh vigour into the Aleppo Nationalists, shaken by the successes ot Turkey in the Sanjak of Alexandretta and the schism so narrowly averted on the recent resignation of the popular Aleppo leader, Hassan Fuad Ibrahim Pasha. 3. In order to ensure that the due measure of popular enthusiasm should not be lacking on the occasion of the Prime Minister s visit, the Finance Depaitment of Aleppo was authorised to distribute £12,000 Syrian (about £1,300 sterling) through the heads of the various quarters of the city to their henchmen, who were called°out to line the streets by which the Ministers entered Aleppo; and subse quently a procession was formed which paraded in front of the Hotel Baron, on the balcony of which the Ministers were seated, from 7 p.m. onwards. In this procession the steelshirts of Aleppo refused to take part. At 8-30 p.m. the Prime Minister made a speech at a local cinema to a concourse of some 3,000 people, in the course of which he declared that Iraq, by rebellion against Great Britain had gained her independence contrary to the intentions of the British, that the Arabs of Palestine, by rebellion, would similarly gain their independence whether Great Britain wished to grant it or not, and that Syria, which had made a treaty of friendship with France, would likewise gain her independence through rebellion if France failed to ratify or respect the treaty; that as regards Alexandretta, Syria would never accept the Franco-Turkish settlement to which she had not been a party; and that while he was away in Europe defending the interests of Syria he relied on the people to rally unitedly to the suppoit of the Nationalist Government and to have no truck with the so-called opposition, which was composed of enemies and traitors to the cause of Syrian independence. 4. Jamil Mardam’s speech was followed by one from Saadullah-el-Jabri, who uttered a violent diatribe against the Opposition which was, he said, trying to rob the Nationalists of the fruit of their long struggle for independence; against the Lebanon, which he characterised as a parasite battening on the life blood of Syria; and against the imperialists, who wished to keep the noble Syrian nation in permanent bondage. He was followed by Dr. Abdurrahman Kayali, who, in more moderate terms, congratulated the Christian minorities on their co-operation with the Nationalist Government which would, he said, do its utmost to protect them from every aggression. He also concluded with an attack on the opposition, enemies of the Franco-Syrian treaty whom the Government would certainly root out. [380 r—1]5. The local press was not allowed to print a full account of these speeches, but was obliged to content itself with an official communique, which was published in identical terms by all newspapers. 6. The Prime Minister and his two colleagues left Aleppo on Friday, the 5th August, for Hama. Homs and Damascus. 7.

I HAVE the honour to report that the apparent inability of France to defend Arab interests in the Sanjak of Alexandretta against Turkey has produced a feeling of consternation at Aleppo, where intelligent opinion is convinced that at some well-chosen moment in the future Turkey will revive pretensions to the whole North Syria region and will again find France equally unwilling or unable to afford protection. 2. The result of this consternation has been a noticeable weakening of the Syrian Nationalist cause on the one hand and an outburst of Turkish propaganda on the other. Twice during last week pamphlets calling upon the population to demand reunion with Turkey, the only Power in the Near East capable of keeping out the foreigner, have been widely distributed in Aleppo, and although two Turkish propagandists alleged to be responsible for these pamphlets have been arrested, it is not to be supposed that with them the pro- Turkish movement here is in any wise scotched. It can only be stopped if France can somehow convince people that she is in the last resort both able and willing to wage war if necessary to keep the Turks out of North Syria and will never again be prepared to sacrifice a section of Syrian territory to a foreign Power for the sake of avoiding possible international complications. 3. In this connexion it must be borne in mind that politically speaking, despite repeated Syrian Nationalist assertions to the contrary, there is much real divergence of interest and sentiment between Aleppo and Damascus, and that the Syrian Nationalist Government since its accession to power has consistently contrived to intensify rather than diminish that divergence; while economically it would suit Aleppo better to be included in a State comprising Turkey, the Sanjak of Alexandretta and the Jezireh, rather than in a shrunken Syria run by and for the Damascene. 4. New evidence of this deep-seated divergence has been painfully apparent during the visit last week to Aleppo of Sa’adullah-el-Jabri, Syrian Minister of the Interior and for Foreign Affairs, who on Friday last made a speech in the principal mosque counselling continued and even long-suffering confidence in the Nationalist Government despite all its apparent failures and declaring three times in succession that the Franco-Syrian Treaty will be ratified. This speech was very coolly received by the crowd and was immediately followed by chronic dissensions among the adherents of the Nationalist Bloc itself as the result of which the leader of the bloc at Aleppo, Dr. Hassan Fuad Ibrahim Pasha, resigned his post. He has many sympathisers. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch direct to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Paris, Angora and Bagdad, and to His Majesty’s consular officers at Beirut and Damascus.

As both Syria and Irani pressure for a partition of Sanjak seemed to me rather unaccountable I asked Dr. Aras what were in his opinion the motives. He himself is also rather puzzled* He surmises that Syria would regard it as a diplomatic success to obtain in full owner ship of a portion of Sanjak: and he senses that Syrian Government entertains hopes of eventually absorbing Lebanon into a Syrian State which would account for their willingness to let Turkey possess the port of Alexandretta. He imagines that the Iraqi Government must be playing at high politics, and working on a conception of Arabic solidarity v/hich he himself regards as muddled and mistaken from the point of view of Iraq’s real interest. He further imagines that two Arabic States will feel that solution of Sanjak problem on Geneva lines is one from which they must continue to dissent: whereas if they could get it changed to a partition and acquire the kudos they anticipate therefrom he believes they would look forward to applying their whole energies to the furtherance of the Arab cause in Palestine.

His Excellency will, however, appreciate that the two parties directly concerned, viz. Turkey on the one hand, and France representing the Syrian Arabs on the other, are now in agreement, and it would in practice be very difficult for His Majesty's Government, who are less directly con cerned, to intervene with a proposal for some completely new solu tion. In principle, His Majesty* sG-overnment have welcomed the fact that Turkey and France, with both of whom, as with Iraq, they are on terms of special friendship, have been able to reach an agreed settlement of the disputeo They would be very reluctant to take any step which migh'c lead to a revival of the differences between Turkey and France. 2. In any case, it is not certain that an ideal solution of the Alexandretta problem is now practicable. Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs advocates partition of the Sanjak, and suggests that His Majesty’s Government should intervene at Angora with a view to persuade the Turks to give up their demand for Antioch in return for acquisition of Alexandretta.

Recent developments will only have strengthened the Turkish Government’s determination on this pointo If His Majesty's Government were now to approach the Turkish Government on lines suggested by Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, they v/ould only meet with the reply that the Turkish Government had no intention or wish other than loyally to adhere to their agreed settlement with France. 3. I note that, in the last resort, Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs would regard partition even with the loss of Antioch as better than Geneva settlement. This is, however, not a point of view on which His Majesty’s Government could base a positive recommendation for a fresh solution of the Alexand- retta problenu If it represents the view of the Syrian Govern ment, they must put it to the French Government. 4. I should have thought that, from the point of view of Syria and Iraq, the Geneva settlement, which I understand it is proposed to continue in a modified form under the Franco-Turkish Agreement, possesses certain definite advantages, e,g, demilitari sation. Surely it would in many respects be far more advantageous to oyria, than an arrangement by which the greater part of the Sanjak, including Antioch, v/ould be handed over to Turkey in full sovereignty 0 5.

The Turks had wished to send 5000 troops into the Sanjak, whereas the French did not want more than 1800 or 2000. M.

Monsieur Bonnet informed representatives of the Press on July Istj in the presence of the Turkish Ambassador, that the negotiations between France and Turkey over Alexandretta had been successfully concluded* France had admitted that the arrangements of 1921 conferred by implication a special position on the Turkish elements in the Sanjak, and Turkey, on her side, had confirmed her territorial disinterestedness. A military agreement defining the conditions in which France and Turkey would, exercise the guarantee which they had jointly assumed, in the Sanjak had been drawn up* A protocol, signed by the two general staffs, fixed, the practical methods of cooperation between the French and Turkish forces* A tripartite convention was also on the road, to conclusion, which would regularise the frontier relations between Turkey and Syria, To complete the whole, a treaty of friendship was on the point of being signed, between France and Turkey, with the object of consolidating the exist ing equilibrium in the Eastern Mediterranean* The negotiations which had. led. to these results had been conducted in that spirit of coniTa&amp;nbe which had. always inspired Franco-Turkish relations, and could only tend, to draw the two countries closer to each other. The Turkish Ambassador in his turn declared, that the Question of the Sanjak had been a decisive test of Franco- Turkish friendship, which had emerged not only intact, but stronger than ever from the negotiations. A new era had now- openedopened in Franco-i'urkish relations. the '’Temps' (Right) adds that the texts have not yet been finally completed, and that the definite signature of the treaty will probably take place when Monsieur Bonnet visits Syria in Sentemher next. It goes on to say that the importance of the treaty of friendship consists in the engagement by the two parties to maintain the political status quo in the Eastern Mediterranean, and to consult when their mutual interests are concerned.

Without distinction of party newspapers consider the event as important and of good augury both as regards the situation in the Near East and in Europe as a whole. It is pointed out that the maintenance of good relations with Turkey is an important aim of British foreign policy, and it is felt to be a matter of congratulation that France has once again been able to align herself with Great Britain. French diplomacy is considered to have secured a considerable success; and Monsieur Bonnet's part is, naturally, specially praised by the Socialist Radical press. In the ’’Populaire' (Socialist) Henri Leroux says that the need for an agreement was urgent, and that the success attained is important. It remains now to ratify the Treaties with Syria and the Lebanon, so that France may show that her friendship with 'Turkey involves no abandonment of her policy of collaboration with the Arabs. In the 'Oeuvre 11 (Socialist-Radical) Madame Tabouis, after praising the agreement. —2. agreement, says that Berlin and Rome have been intriguing at Angora to prevent the success of the negotiations, and that Monsieur Bonnet has thus secured a co isiderable triumph for the democracies at a critical moment. Wladimir d Ormesson in the H Figaro' (Right) considers that the event is happy and important, and says that a Franco-Anglo-furko-Greek regroupment is taking place in the Near Bast the importance of which will escape nobody. The only discordant note is struck, as so often, by Peri in ?, L'Humanite n (Communist), who asks if France has decided to impose in the Sanjak a majority which the Sanjak does not want; and says that while Franco -Turkish friendship is no doubt necessary it is impossible to buy this friendship at the price of the general hostility of the Arab world.

Minister for Foreign Affairs again raised question of Alexandretta at weeking meeting this morning. He said that anxiety had keen aroused in Iraq by reports that French had agreed to give to Turkish community twenty-two of the forty seats in Assembly regardless of the rrab majority revealed by the recent registration of electors and that this anxiety had been increased by news published in the Press in London that Turkish troops were to co-operate with the French in maintaining order in the Sanjak. He added that people in Iraq were at a loss to understand the attitude oi IDs Majesty’s Government on this question. To many, the coincidence of Turkish aggressiveness about Alexandretta with the conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish credits agreement and the contrast between the ease with which Turkey obtained a credit of six millions for arms with the difficulties experienced by the Iraqi Government in obtaining her own modest requirements, suggested that Great Britain was abandoning her old friendship with the Arabs in favour of a rapprochement with the Turks. he mentioned that an article which had appeared recently in the 'Daily Sketch' advocating such a policy had been accepted by many as confirmation of suspicions aroused by current events. I assured Mis Excellency that British friend- ship with the Turks was apart from general policy, based on the recognition ..,2 . i^ognition of Turkey's value as a stabilising eleuent in che Mediterranean and Balkans, and did not imply any change in the traditional friendship of Bis Majesty's Government with the Arab countries to the south of Turkey. The Minister said that he was very pleased to hear this but he could not disguise the fears which the Iraqi Government felt about Turkish plans for the future. If Turks obtained a strangle hold over Alexandretta they would next claim Aleppo and after that there was no knowing what claims they might not put forward aoout the Turkish minorities in the Mosul wilayet . He thought that in the interests of peace in the Middle bast it was most important to secure a fair and final settlement of the Sanjak question. Gould not His Majesty s Government use their influence to bring about an honest plebiscite to oe followed by frontier adjustments which would leave the Turks in Turkey and the Arabs in Syria end thus dispose of the most likely causes of future friction and disturbances? Under such an arrangement he was prepared to see Alexandretta itself go to the Turks. He was convinced that the statute of Alexandretta designed in Geneva would only lead to endless trouble and difficulty ana would be exploited by the Turks as a basis for further demands. I under took to report his observations to you. I think it is desirable that 1 should be furnished with suitable reoly and provided you see no objection I shoula_ oe glad, to receive for communication to Minister ior foreign Affairs summary of the nosition of Franco-Turkish negotiations concerning the Sanjak and outline of general attitude 01 His Majesty s Government towards this question.

Attitude of His Majesty's Government may for your own information he summarised as follows 2. First and foremost they are not protagonists and are anxious not to he manoeuvred into heooming protagonists. France as Mandatory Power is responsible for protecting interests of Syria and except as Members of League His Majesty*s Government do not feel called upon to pronounce upon whether that responsibility is being carried out adequately and in good faith, and still less to accept that responsibility themselves. 5. Moreover, so far as British local interests are concerned, sovereignty and form of administration of Sanjah are matters to which His Majesty's Government are largely, although not entirely, indifferent. 4. At the same time His Majesty's Government are interested in the dispute: (a) as a Member of the League (b) as. a close friend of both parties. o. As a Member of League they would for their oart probably be prepared to. .accept any solution reached by the two parties themselves, provided it held out some prospect of a lasting settlement. 6.2, 6e ,as a friend of doth parties they are anxious above all that there should be no rupture which might render it difficult for them to carry out policy of cementing their friendship with Turkey (to which they attach the greatest importance) and might even compromise the peace of the world* 7. Whether notwithstanding the above His Majesty’s Government should intervene because their Iraqi allies and other Arab countries whose friendship they value sympathise with Syria is a separate question. It raises wide issues and I can only say that His Majesty’s Government are fully alive to necessity of preserving Arab friendship, 8. Subject to this general explanation^ my comments on Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs’ remarks and suggestions are as follows (a) His .excellency has every reason to deplore agreement giving Turkish community 22 seats (which is not 3 however, it must be remembered, publicly acknowledged). His Majesty s Government, entirely disapprove of this agreement mainly because of false position in which it places League* This does not, however, mean that the cause of peace may not ultimately be best served by letting the Turkish community have a majority* (b) Question of entry of Turkish troops into Sanjak for co operation with French authorities must be distinguished from a Turkish occupation. His Majesty*s Government would prefer Turkish troops not to enter at all, but matter is in their opinion one for discretion of French Government, (c) attitude of His Majesty’s Government is as stated above. Grant-j. 5. Grant of credits and Alexandretta are entirely separate questions. Far from encouraging Turkey over i:lexandretta as a means of winning Turkish friendship, His Majesty*s Government have throughout used such influence as their cultivation of Turkish friendship by other methods has given them in order to speak to Turkish Government about Alexandretta with a frankness which would otherwise be impossible. But this does not mean that their influence can be used beyond a certain point without becoming compromised, (d) Incidentally there can be no comparison between credits and supply of specific arms. Turkish Government will not be able to use credits to purchase any arms with which His Majesty's Government have not been able to supply Iraqi Government. As it happens they want warships. (e) Turkish policy in the distant future must necessarily be a matter of speculation. But His Majesty’s Government think that, provided outcome of present dispute does not leave Turkey with a sense of grievance, Turkey will continue to regard herself as a territorially sated Power for an appreciable time to come. (f) His Majesty’s Government agree that a fair and final settlement is most important in interest of peace in Middle Hast. They have done all they can to secure honest elections and will continue to do so, but they cannot do more than the Mandatory Power. France has by a weak and inconsistent policy placed herself in most difficult position over elections and it is at present impossible to foresee in what manner she will extricate herself. (g) His Majesty's Government are inclined to agree that a frontier adjustment might in the long run be more satisfactory than the League statute. The difficulty is that the Turkish GovernmentGovernment would probably never agree to any adjustment which did not give them town of Antioch, as otherwise large numbers of Turks would in their ouinion be left under Syrian control without even the protection of the Statute. Time aixd manner of suggesting this alternative must in any case be carefully chosen, even if His Majesty’s Government can take initiative at all. 9. I hope that this telegram will help to provide you with background against which to frame any further conversations with Minister for Foreign Affairs. But you will realise that much of it it unsuitable for communication to Iraqi Government and subject to your observations your reply to representations already made should as far as possible follow lines indicated in my immediately following telegram.

You may also say that His Majesty’s Government sympathise with reasons which have led Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs to make certain suggestions, but that they have no locus standi to intervene save as a member of League Council Committee. As such they are bound by decisions already taken by Council as to lines on which a solution of problem should be sought (i.e. retention of Sanjak in Syria under special regime). Unless efforts now being made to give effect to these decisions were to break down, it would therefore not be open to them to suggest solution on different lines (e.g. partition of Sanjak). 4. I regret that I have no information to give Iraqi Government about Franco-Turkish discussions. I hear that French Government are unwilling to agree to certain Turkish proposals. If this is so, matter may again come before Council. In any case Iraqi Government may rest assured that only wish of His Majesty’s Government is that an equitable settlement shall be reached and their good offices will always be available if sought by parties most closely concerned.

CONFIDENTIAL 1 w, &gt;•&lt; \ Section 1. [E 264/29/89] Copy No. Memorandum respecting the Franco-Turkish Dispute over the Sanjak of A lexandretta. ON the 29th May, 1937, the Council of the League of Nations adopted a resolution approving the texts of the Organic Statute and of the Fundamental Law of the Sanjak of Alexandretta. According to these instruments, the sanjak was to constitute a separate entity, enjoying full independence in its internal affairs, while the State of Syria was to be responsible for its foreign affairs. The statute and the Fundamental Law were to enter into force on the 29th November, 1937, and it was laid down that during such time as the mandate for Syria remained in operation they should be applied to the fullest extent compatible with the exercise of the mandate. 2. Article 15 of the Fundamental Law provided that the whole of the pro ceedings involved in the first elections held for the purpose of choosing Deputies for the Assembly of the sanjak should be organised and supervised by a com mission, the members of which should be appointed by the Council of the League of Nations. This commission was to be composed of nationals of States members of the League of Nations other than France and Turkey. In accordance with this provision, the Council set up a commission of five members to prepare and to supervise the elections. The president of this Electoral Commission was the British member, Mr. T. Reid. 3. After a short stay at Geneva, the commission left on the 14th October, 1937, for Alexandretta, where it remained until the 19th November. During its stay in the sanjak the commission made the necessary enquiries and preparations with a view to the electoral proceedings, including the registration of voters. The commission left the sanjak towards the end of November and, at a further session in Geneva, from the 30th November to the 10th December, completed its plans for the organisation and supervision of the elections, and, more particularly, drafted a document entitled “ Regulations for the First Elections to the Assembly of the Sanjak of Alexandretta.” 4. It should be explained at this point that, by chapter I of the Fundamental Law, the elections are to be conducted in two stages. Those who are entitled to vote at the first stage of the elections (i.e., males over 20 years of age) must, in order to be included in the electoral list, first register in the presence of the delegates of the Electoral Commission as members of one of seven specified racial- religious communities. The number of second-stage electors, and ultimately of Deputies, allotted to the various communities in the sanjak as a whole will be determined by the number of first-stage voters registered as belonging to each community. Consequently, the registration of voters will, in effect, decide the proportions in which the various communities will be represented in the Assembly. 5. It became clear to the commission during its stay in the sanjak that the Turkish element, with the assistance of the Turkish consul and with the unofficial support of the Turkish Government, intended to influence the non-Turkish elements by bribery and intimidation to register themselves as Turks, which would subsequently compel them to vote for Turkish candidates in the elections. The commission determined, however, to oppose this plan, and certain provisions of the electoral regulations (see paragraph 10 below) are meant to ensure that no undue pressure to register in any particular community shall be exerted by adherents of that community upon voters who do not really belong to it. 6. The first indication that the Turkish Government were taking serious exception to the activities of the Electoral Commission was contained in a note of the 2nd December sent by the Turkish Government to the French Government. This note complained that the mandatory authorities in the sanjak had exercised [205 m—1]2 illegitimate pressure on the Electoral Commission and were, by various unfair administrative methods, conspiring to ensure that the coming elections in the sanjak should be as unfavourable to the Turkish element as possible. This communication was followed on the 15th December by a telegram from the Turkish Government to the Secretary-General of the League. This telegram contained ^ two grounds for complaint. In the first place, the Turkish Government alleged that the commission had collaborated with the mandatory authorities in the sanjak and that the electoral regulations had been drafted in consultation with them and were the result of this collaboration. In the second place, exception was taken to the fact that the electoral regulations were communicated officially to the mandatory Power for enactment into law, whereas they were only communi cated unofficially to the Turkish Government. 7. As regards the first point, the president of the commission has explained that the regulations were not the result of collaboration between the commission and the mandatory authorities. Communications between the commission and the mandatory authorities were confined to requests by the former for information and the supply of this information by the latter. It was clearly impossible for the commission to devise a practicable electoral procedure without first obtaining information on numerous details from the authorities in the sanjak, supplemented by unofficial information obtained from representatives of all the different com munities. Further, the mandatory authorities never attempted to influence the commission's decisions, nor to ascertain what these decisions were. The commission was consequently solely responsible for the electoral regulations. 8. As regards the second complaint, the president has explained that the regulations were communicated officially by the commission to the mandatory Power, not for approval or for criticism, but as the final decision of the com mission, which it was necessary to communicate to the mandatory Power as it alone possessed the necessary legislative power to enact them into law. In so far as the Turkish Government were concerned, the Secretariat of the League, on its own initiative, communicated a copy of the regulations to the permanent delegate of Turkey at Geneva, simply as a matter of courtesy to a Power which was naturally interested. It should be noted here that there is no provision in the Geneva Settlement of the 29th May for submitting the decisions of the Electoral Commission to Turkey, either for approval or for criticism, and that the Turkish Government have no ground for complaint in that the regulations were not com municated to them officially. Nor, however, is there any provision for submitting the decisions of the commission to France, as the mandatory Power, or for that matter for their submission to the Council or the Secretariat of the League. 9. A further telegram was sent by the Turkish Government to the Secretary- General of the League on the 24th December. This telegram reiterated the allegation contained in the telegram of the 15th December that the regulations were the result of collaboration between the mandatory Power and the commission and complained that Turkey, the other Power interested in the arrangements adopted for the sanjak, was not consulted even on points of detail. It, furthermore, made certain detailed criticisms of the regulations. 10. For instance, exception was taken by the Turkish Government to the penal provisions in the regulations, which are claimed to be excessively harsh. Mr. Reid has pointed out that these penal provisions are based upon the Syrian practice and are very considerably milder than those normally applied in Syria. Then, again, the Turkish Government complained of the registration procedure. They claimed that it was the intention of the Council, in its resolutions, that there should be no supervision over the first stage in the elections, except for the purpose of preventing duplicate registrations, and no indirect influence exercised over the free expression of the people’s will. With regard to this complaint Mr. Reid has pointed out that the commission, realising the intentions of the Turkish element, as stated above, to intimidate the non-Turkish elements, have in fact devised a procedure which shall ensure that no one shall register in a community to which he does not belong, and has with this end in view reserved to itself a final decision in cases of dispute regarding the community in which any elector shall be registered. 11. This last point is the crux of the whole dispute, and it is necessary to consider it in rather greater detail. Although the Turkish Government’s telegram of the 24th December does not specifically raise the point, it might be argued that3 there is a discrepancy between articles 9 and 14 of the Fundamental Law of the sanjak and articles i 5 to 24 of the electoral regulations regarding the freedom of voters to decide as to the communities to which they shall belong. Article 9 of the Fundamental Law states that electors at the first stage shall register in the ^Dresence of delegates of the commission as members of one of the specified com- ^niunities, while article 14 states that “each elector shall receive only one voting paper, which shall contain the list of the candidates of the community to which he has declared himself to belong ,the last phrase possibly implying that the elector has complete freedom to choose the community in which he wushes to vote. On the other hand, the electoral regulations reserve, as has been said, to the commission the final right to decide to what community the elector shall be registered as a member. 12. The Turkish Government may therefore argue that the commission, in reserving to itself the ultimate final decision on this point, are interfering with liberty which the Fundamental Law intended to give every voter. The answer, if this point should be raised, appears to be that the electors are in danger of being subjected at present to so much illegal pressure that the only way to protect them against such pressure and to give them effective freedom is for the commission to assume the ultimate responsibility for deciding in cases of doubt in which com munity any particular voter should be included. If the Turkish view were to prevail that the commission should have no right of this kind, the elections would, it is said, inevitably be accompanied by riots and bloodshed on a large scale. 13. It will be clear from the above that the Turkish Government have no moral justification for their complaint, against the draft electoral regulations, which are designed to secure a fair election. The legal position is, however, less certain and a note by Mr. Beckett, in which he expresses the opinion that the regulations may be ultra vires the powers of the commission, forms an annex to this memorandum. 14. On receipt of the telegram of the 24th December the League Secretariat telegraphed to Angora enquiring whether the Turkish Government wished the question to be included in the agenda for the next session of the League Council. The Turkish Government replied that they did desire this. 15. It remains to consider the position of the three Powers principally interested in this dispute. The Turkish Government apparently hope that, by bringing the whole question up once more at Geneva, they will be able to secure a compromise involving further concessions by the French Government which will make it easier for them to exert sufficient influence over the non-Turkish elements to secure a majority and thus obtain ultimate control of the sanjak and eventually (perhaps) its separation from Syria. 16. As regards the attitude of the French Government, there is as yet no definite information. There are, however, indications to suggest that the French authorities may be anxious to disinterest themselves from the affairs of the sanjak, and that the French Government might be willing to consider some compromise which would go some way to meet the Turkish Government’s veiled demand for a greater degree of influence in the sanjak. 17. As regards the attitude of His Majesty’s Government they are close friends both of France and of Turkey, and their sole desire is to see a just settle ment of this dangerous question arrived at on the merits of the case. At the same time, for the reasons contained in Part III of Mr. Ward’s memorandum of the 11th January, 1937,His Majesty’s Government would be strongly opposed to any solution which might lead to a change in the international status of the sanjak.

Note by Mr. Reckett. Registration of Voters for the Assembly of the Sanjak of Alexandretta. I THINK that the word “ organised ' in article 15 of the Fundamental Law may be held to imply the power to draw up regulations. But the regulations must not contravene the Fundamental Law. I should certainly draw the conclusion myself from article 14 of the Fundamental Law that the electors had merely to state “ I belong to this or that community,” and that they had to be registered under article 9 of the law according to their declaration; and since the commission in articles 15-24 of their electoral regulations set forth a procedure specially designed to check the effects of Turkish bribery and pressure on the electors, which may, I fear, be held to be ultra vires the powers of the commission, I am not alto gether surprised that the Turkish Government are attacking the commission.

CONFIDENTIAL. | E 902/3/89] Copy No. Consul Davis to Mr. Eden.—(Received February 10.) (No. 14.) Sir. Aleppo, February 4, 1937. I HAVE the honour to report that I visited Antioch and Alexandretta on the 1st February for the purpose of enquiring into local reactions to the agreement recently reached at Geneva regarded the future status of the sandjak. 2. The impression I gained from first-hand observation is that the proposed autonomous regime for the sanjak is welcomed by at least 90 per cent, of the population. The demonstrations of protest at Alexandretta reported in my telegram No. 6 of the 27th January last were anything but spontaneous. Local Arab Nationalists received from Damascus and Aleppo orders to organise such demonstrations, but they received so little support locally that they had to send emissaries of the steelshirts to compel shopkeepers to close down under threat of violence. Even so, they were unable to secure the closure of Turkish shops. Similar demonstrations in Antioch received even more modified support. This is in marked contrast to Aleppo, where feeling against the agreement has run very high. 3. As regards the Turkish element in the sanjak, it is, 1 think, true to say that they are relieved at the non-incorporation of the sanjak in Turkey, at least as much as they are at the knowledge that they are not to pass under Arab rule. Though they are anxious to preserve their Turkish traditions, language and culture, they have no desire whatsoever to become citizens of the Turkish Republic, a change that would involve the forcible abandonment of many customs and religious institutions which they are still old-fashioned enough to venerate. The proposed autonomous regime satisfies all their aspirations. 4. The Alaouite population in the sanjak, only slightly less in numbers than the Turks, is equally satisfied at the prospect of a local autonomy. Their fear was that by incorporation in Syria they would become a comparatively unim portant minority whose feelings and interests the Arab Nationalists would at some future date be easily tempted to disrespect. The present alliance between Arabs and Alaouites, a very recent outgrowth of the political campaign against the French, cannot possibly be expected to survive permanently against the secular contempt and hatred which is the normal attitude of orthodox Arabs towards the Alaouite sectaries. 5. The Armenians, next in numerical importance in the population of the sanjak, were on the verge of panic terror at the reports of concentrations of Turkish troops along the frontier. Their relief is indescribable now that they realise that the bogy of Turkish occupation has passed. That they should also escape Arab rule was almost more than they had hoped. The proposed local autonomy under the supervision of a commissioner appointed by the League offers them the best guarantees for their future security. As a result the efflux of Armenians from the sanjak has now ceased and those who came out in fear and trembling are beginning to return to their homes. 6. Other minorities, including Christians and Jews, are equally satisfied with the guarantees for their security implied by the proposed League supervision of the future administration of the sanjak, while at the same time their com mercial interests are safeguarded by the customs and monetary union with Syria. Their great fear that any change in the status of the sandjak would cut off their commercial relations with Aleppo and its hinterland has been happily dispelled. The proposed establishment of a Turkish zone in the Port of Alexandretta does not threaten their interests at all since their legitimate trade with Turkey has been negligible. 7. In consonance with these considerations I remarked at Antioch and Alexandretta a great relaxation of tension and an air of considerable satisfaction. [931 k—1] Jit z 136 x u February 10, 1937. Section 1.At Bey la n, a Turkish centre in the pass that leads from Antioch to Alexandretta, the place was plentifully decorated with greenery, but there was a noticeable absence of specifically Turkish insignia. At Antioch, too, scarcely a person was to be seen wearing the Turkish badge that w^as so popular there when the dispute was at its height. At Rihaniye, scene of the only fatal clash which marked the dispute, everything was peaceful and everyone contentedly following their normal avocations. Nowhere in the sanjak did I meet any military force. Even the gendarmerie, who were always to be seen actively patrolling the roads while the dispute lasted, were conspicuously absent everywhere. 8.

IN my telegra m No. 3 , dated the 19th January, I reported the request of His Majesty King AbduTAziz for the advice of His Majesty’s Government about the question of Alexandretta and my discouraging personal reply. I now have the honour to report more fully the conversation which I had with Fuad Bey on the subject. 2. Fuad Bey said that the King had received a large number of telegrams and other messages from all parts of the Arab world, urging him to take some action to defend the rights of the Arabs in regard to Alexandretta, which were threatened by the Turks. The King had maintained friendly relations with Turkey, and was not anxious that they should be disturbed, but still. . . . Here I asked why His Majesty should feel that he had to do something. Fuad Bey said that His Majesty must naturally feel strongly about a matter affecting the Arab world so closely. He did not want to do anything, however, without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. How would it he if he appealed to the Turks ? 3. I said that so far as my knowledge went His Majesty’s Government considered that Alexandretta (I followed Fuad Bey in saying “ Alexandretta,” though he no doubt meant Antioch as well) ought to remain within the Syrian group of territories, and that their efforts were being bent to that end, and I quoted what is common knowledge about the progress of the Franco-Turkish negotiations. As this did not appear to console Fuad Bey, I asked what reason there was to think that an appeal to the Turks would operate in the desired direction. The Turks would ask what standing Saudi Arabia had in the matter, and it might tend to make them more instead of less difficult. It might recall the Arab revolt and arouse hostility instead of sympathy. It was, of course, for His Majesty to decide whether to approach the Turks or not, but I personally doubted the utility of such a step. 4. Fuad Bey went on to refer to that suspicion of Turkey of which Ibn Saud has given evidence from time to time. His Majesty had always believed, he said, that Turkey had never really abandoned her claim to Mosul and its oil, that she was only awaiting a chance to revive that claim, and that if she had her way with Alexandretta it would be an encouragement to her in the matter of Iraq. The Arabs regarded the Turks and the Persians as their hereditary enemies. He himself had spoken of King Abdul Aziz’s fears of Turkey, when he was at the Foreign Office several years ago, and had received a reply intended to calm those fears, but they still existed. To my statement that the Turks seemed to prefer a homogeneous country and not to want to absorb non-Turkish populations, Fuad Bey asked why then they coveted Alexandretta. He had had discussions with Turkish officials at Angora a few years ago, and had received assurances that they felt no resentment for the past, and that modern Turkey coveted no Arab land. The Turkish policy with regard to Alexandretta was in conflict with those assurances. I pointed out, however, that the basis of the Turkish claim was that in their opinion the majority of the population of Alexandretta was Turkish. 5. And now I felt that a warning ought to be uttered. I suggested that Fuad Bey was creating a dangerous state of confusion by using the phrase “ Arab world ” in two quite different senses. There was an Arab world in the sense that there were communities Arab in language and Moslem in religion which might have certain sympathies in common,'but he appeared to be using the phrase as though it stood for a political entity which was called upon to take action when ever the interests of any Arabs anywhere were affected. This, I said, seemed to me a most dangerous doctrine and likely to cause serious trouble if acted upon. He [931 h—1]■nr ' 2 should not be misled by the case of the appeal of the Arab rulers in the Palestine question, which had a strictly limited application, and where, moreover, the other party concerned was the British Government, whose sympathies in regard to the Arabs were well known. It would be a fatal mistake to suppose that inter vention on behalf of Arab interests could always be made with advantage, and would always be so well received. 6. I made it quite clear that I was expressing my personal views, and that for a reply to King Abdul Aziz I must report to the Foreign Office. Fuad Bey said that his views did not differ essentially from mine, but the impression I received was that the appeals to do something about Alexandretta have brought both him and the King face to face with reality, and that the confrontation has given them a salutary shock. All was going so well. The Arab rulers had had to be called in to assist the British authorities in Palestine. Then the Alexandretta question comes up, Ibn Saud is asked by the “ Arab world ” to intervene. If he does nothing and Alexandretta is lost, or if Alexandretta is won without his obvious aid, the hard-won prestige will be gone or badly damaged. But what is he to do? He cannot really believe that Kemal Ataturk’s policy is going to be affected by an appeal from the King of Saudi Arabia. He must realise that in the present matter the Arab case depends not at all upon himself and his fellow- rulers, but very largely upon France and Great Britain. I suggest that this discovery may have come to other Arabs than Ibn Saud and his deputy Foreign Minister, and that it may have a salutary effect in discouraging the wilder pan-Arab schemes and in spreading the conviction that it would not be better for the “ Arab world ” in the long run if the Arabs tried to upset the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Near and Middle East. 7.

Section 2. [E 668/3/89] Copy No. Viscount Chilston to Mr. Eden.—(Received January 29.) (No. 42.) Sir, Moscow, January 26, 1937. WITH reference to your despatch No. 29 enclosing a memorandum of the 11th January on the Alexandretta dispute, I have the honour to inform you that the Soviet press has carefully avoided all expression of opinion regarding this question, while reproducing accounts of the progress of the dispute, and foreign comments on it, to an extent which seems to reveal great interest on the part of the Soviet Government. 2. The report now received of the satisfactory settlement of the dispute at Geneva would, no doubt, have given rise to long articles here, had not the trial of M. Pyatakov and his associates reduced all other news to negligible proportions. Nevertheless, a brief telephone message published to-day on the front page of the Izvestiya appears to me to have a certain interest. The newspaper's special correspondent emphasises, as was to be expected, the fact that this is the second dispute which Turkey has seen fit to solve by peaceful methods, as opposed to “ the Italo-German technique of the fait accompli.' He goes on to say that it is no secret at Geneva that both Germany and Italy pressed the Turkish Govern ment in a “ friendly ” way to seize the sanjak by armed force; and that German advisers in particular urged the advantages of such tactics, hoping to advance thereby the date of a general conflict. The fact that Turkey declined to follow this advice is welcomed by the correspondent as a good augury, “especially at a moment when the exponents of the fait accompli and their closest associates are endeavouring by every means in their power to reduce to nothing the rights of the League High Commissioner at Danzig.” 3. The Izvestiya's correspondent concludes by drawing attention to “one extremely important fact ” : From the outset of the conflict, he states, certain organs of the foreign press, and particularly of the Italian press, persistently put about rumours to the effect that Great Britain was against France in this question, and was bent on achieving the complete separation of the sanjak from the rest of Syria. “ Discussions at Geneva have shown these reports to be completely untrue. In this question also, Anglo-French solidarity has been maintained intact.” 4. In view of the fact that M. Litvinov is now at Geneva, I think we may assume that this telephonic message represents the views of the Soviet Govern ment. Despite the recent signs of a cooling-off in Turco-Soviet relations, the U.S.S.R. would presumably have stood to gain, if only for the reason given in paragraph 3 of your telegram No. 173 of the 14th December last to Angora, by Turkey’s absorption of the sanjak. Probably, however, the Soviet Government were well aware that this was not a practical possibility, and in the meantime they have a paramount interest in the conservation of Anglo-French solidarity. 5.

Further demonstrations also took place at Aleppo yesterday but on a scale much smaller than those reported in my telegram No.5 of January 26th. In the afternoon a body of students about three hundred strong paraded before this Consulate and handed in a letter in Arabic of which a translation is enclosed. A copy of a letter received this morning by me from the deputies of Aleppo is also enclosed. 3. Fe ling in Aleppo is undoubtedly deeply moved by what the Arab Nationalists regard as a betrayal on the part of the French of the legitimate rights of Syria in the Sanjak of Alexandretta. It remains to be seen whether this resentment will be prolonged or will have the effect of again embittering relations between the Mandatory and the Syrian Nationalists which had become so friendly after the recent Franco-Syrian Treaty.

January 4, 1937. [E 25/3/89] CONFIDENTIAL. Sir P. Loraine to Mr. K Section 2. Copy No J19 (No. 627.) Sir, Angora, December 1936. I HAVE the honour, with reference to my telegram No. 193 of the 14th December, to acquaint you with the terms of a speech - made on the 14th December on the occasion of the opening of the Turkish “ Week of Thrift ” by the President of the Council, regarding the question of Alexandretta and Antioch. 2. General Ismet Inonii began by explaining the Turkish view of France’s position and obligations in the matter. He claimed that Alexandretta and Antioch, which Turkey had ceded by the treaties of 1921 and 1923, subject to certain special conditions, should recover their independence as a result of recent developments. Asa first step Turkey considered it essential that measures should be taken to ensure the preservation of public security in the sanjak in order that no untoward incident might take place and that the situation might be discussed in an atmosphere of calm. General Inonii went on to emphasise the friendliness of relations between Turkey and France and the desire of Turkey to arrive at a friendly solution of the problem. 3. Turning to a discussion of the question in so far as it affected Syria, General Inonti observed, in the course of a somewhat obscure disquisition, that certain elements in Syria professed to see in Turkey’s attitude an attempt by what they called the traditional enemies of the Arabs to steal a part of the Arab heritage. This was not the case. Turkey was not an enemy of the Arabs. If Arabs had suffered under the Ottoman regime, so had Turks, and, moreover, in many cases the guiding force in the administration of the Sultans had been Arab, and not Turk. Again Turkey had consistently stood out, after the war, against the establishment of mandates over the Arabs and had wished them to direct their own destinies. Republican Turkey, too, had officially adopted as its policy the principle of leaving the Arab countries to the Arabs, but would not agree that Arabs should be in a position to draw away from their Turkish nationality a population of a region bordering on Turkey. One zone of Alexandretta and Antioch was not Arab but Turkish, and Turkey had never ceded it to Syria. Though viewing with all sympathy Syria’s progress towards independence, and eager for good neighbourly relations with that State, Turkey was surprised and hurt by the expressed desire of Syria to exercise domination over a Turkish territory—a domination which Turkey would never tolerate. The opinion had been expressed that Syria needed a port in the Alexandretta zone; this, however, did not imply the necessity for Syrian sovereignty over that zone. The regions of Turkey for which the port of Alexandretta was needed were far vaster than the parts of Northern Syria which were served by that port. The economic aspect of the question could easily be separated from the question of sovereignty, but Syria must clearly understand that Turkey considered the question of Alexandretta and Antioch and neighbourhood as a national question. 4. In conclusion General Inonii reiterated Turkey’s fidelity to the principles of the League of Nations and her confidence that it would be possible to reach a satisfactory solution of the problem through the mechanism of the League. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris and to the United Kingdom delegation at Geneva. I have, &amp;c. PERCY LORAINE.

No. 3, •oOo- Following froi Secretary of State Monsieur Yienot comiunicated to lir. Rendel on January 21st copy of personal letter of January 18th from n. Blum to lurxvish Ambassador at Paris of which the following is summary: 2. If discussion were to be continued on juridical basis M. Blum could only endorse position already developed by the French Delegation at Geneva and particularly that Turkey’s abandonment of sovereignty over the Sanjak by the Treaty of Lausanne was un conditional and that 1921 agreements did not involve independence of Sanjak after the termination of mandate. But juridical arguments would not facilitate conciliation and the council of the League of Nations appeared best able to bring about settlement. The French Government therefore would raise no objection to the rapporteur’s interpreting her mandate in the widest possible fashion and would accept in advance the council s decision. 3. Meanwhile M. Blum put forward the following ideas with a view to preparation between the parties basis for such a decision. Important point was the situation after coming inoo force of lio.n^ Syrian Treaty when Turkey might legitimately feel anxious as to l.js continuance of the execution of the 1921 agreement. M. Blam agrc^a that execution of this agreement should be guaranteed nou solely 03 / the state of Syria as successor to France but also by the League ci Nations on whose behalf France as the mandatory Power was aci-ing in 1921. League would therefore retain a measure of responsibilityeven after entry into force of the franco-Syrian 'treaty and this could best be fulfilled by creation of special r 6 gime for the Sanjak-alone without its detach .lent froiii Syria under a League of Nations coniuissioner who v/ould however have to be a Nrenchnan. 4. rending eaancipation of Syria a provisional r 6 gime would be established to prepare the ground for permanent regime e Under this full satisfaction would be given to Turkish desiderata as regards administration and cultural regulations,demilitarisation and use by the Turkish Government of Alexandretta harbour. Only difficult points would be (a) appointment of Governor (or Com missioner; which could perhaps best be undertaken by permanent Mandate Commission and (b} participation of representatives of Sanjak in the Syrian Assembly. But council could hardly fail to devise solution or compromise which the French Government would agree to accept in advance. L* Above suggestions are being put forward with a view to remedying the true causes of the rranco-Turkish disagreement. It was far more for the sake of Franco-Turkish friendship than on juridical or political grounds that Ik Blit a saw objection to Turkish proposals for [gr.undec. ] state supervision of which he felt sure could never work without constant friction and difficulty. 6 . Shortly after receipt of this letter Turkish Delegation here raised [gr.omit. ] at first orally but later at French instance in writing following interpretative queries. Turkish Government presumed: ( 1 ) that during the provisional period local administration would enjoy full administrative rights in all matters affecting administra tion of the Sanjam; (2) That there would be no representatives of the Q Q udi njak in me Damascus legislature or assembly;5. ~ (5; That a governor, who should be chosen with the help of permanent _.andate Couuission Tro , ainongst Turkish inhabitants of the Ganjak, would exercise administrative authority there ’’in liaison 1 ' with the Trench High Couxissooner. (4) That demilitarization of the Ganjak would be carried out in such a v/ay as to leave only local police and gendarmerie forces therein; (5) that a wide area would be conceded to Turney in the port of Alexandretta for basic transit trade; ( 6 ; Turkish Government suggest as a corollary to above the desire to set up during provisional period deliberate assembly in the Sanjak and autonomous heads for the different administrative services; 7. French Delegation have replied as follows: (1) There is no question of two distinct assemblies but merely of two aspects of one problem i.e. permanent regime and its provisional and prepara tory application pending termination of mandate, (2) Turkish Govern ment's questions must therefore apply no less to permanent than to provisional regime. 8 . French reply then deals with minor points in the light of above observations and points out that Turkish questionnaire has misinterpreted proposals of Monsieur Blum who after having carefully studied the Turkish proposals of January 12th for a three state con federation cannot contemplate any solution which should involve dismemberment of Syria and which would thereby be contrary to terms of mandate. French Government are however prepared as regards de militarization and freedom of zone. 9. Copies of above documents are being sent by bag. 10. French Delegation have emphasized that Turkish Delegation appear to be wilfully misinterpreting monsieur BlunFs proposals which are exceedingly generous. They also explain that Monsieur Blum’s,.&lt;\ 4.

I HAVE the honour to report that the elections of the first degree were carried out in the Sanjak of Alexandretta on the 15th November for the purpose of the constitution of a new Parliament to ratify the Franco-Syrian Treaty. These elections have, at last, torn off the veil behind which the animosity of the various groups in the sanjak, .and, more especially, the pro-Turkish element, were hidden. 2. The elections, although officially proclaimed to have been a success in Government circles, have, in reality, turned out to be a complete failure. It has been estimated that only 8 per cent, of the electors voted, and the pro-Turkish element abstained from voting altogether. The cause of this failure is attributed to the strong idea prevailing in the sanjak that France is prepared to hand over this district to Turkey, and the inhabitants fear that they may be black-listed when the Turks take possession, should they vote for a Syrian Nationalist. 3. A clash took place at Antioch on the day of the elections between the opposing parties, and the local authorities were obliged to reinforce their police by calling up reserves of Arab policemen from the interior, and the military authorities were advised to have troops standing by. 4. During the course of a conversation which I had with M. Durrieux, the French delegate to the Sanjak of Alexandretta, he informed me that the Turks had sent several agents into the sanjak to stir up the pro-Turkish element against the Arabs with the idea of wrecking the elections. He read to me a letter from one of these agents to a pro-Turkish propagandist at Kirik-Khan, which had been intercepted by the local authorities, and contained the following instructions: that the propagandist should inform all his supporters that Turkey would take possession of the sanjak in the immediate future, and that the four Turkish regiments at present on manoeuvres between Kurd-Kulack and Islahie were ready to advance across the Turco-Syrian frontier as follows : one column to Azaz and Rihanie, a second to Kirik-Khan and Antioch, and a third to Alexandretta. M. Durrieux added that, in fact, two Turkish divisions were actually on the Turco-Syrian frontier and that, to his knowledge, a Turkish agent has been in contact with the villagers and mountaineers living on the frontier between Fayas and Hadjilar. 5. It has further come to my knowledge from a reliable source that arms are being smuggled on a large scale across the frontier for the purpose of arming pro-Turkish element in the sanjak. From my long experience of this country I have come to the conclusion that, if the necessary and energetic steps are not taken by the mandatory authorities, a serious clash will take place in the very near future with, of course, the resultant serious bloodshed on both sides. 6.

For what it may he worth the theory I have myself evolved to iccount for the strength of the Turkish feeling especially of Sonsieur Ataturk about the Sanjak is as follows. That in 1921 when conditions were very different to what tney are now and Franklin Bouillon negotiations '..ere virtually British the French gave the Turks far more categorical assurances about the quasi -iidependent position tney intended to cr a the Sanjalt than what were actually embodied in i921 treaty cuid may quite litely even have led the Turks to hope for eventual retrocession of the Sanjak to funcey.

That Turkish expectation when the Turkish Government firs, v-w-i -i o £&gt;rl2. Raised the question was that France as Turkey’s friend would honour her implied engagement either by retroceding the Sanjak or by modifying her treaty with Syria in a way that would render possible later on the reversion of the Sanjak to Turkey, hence the sharp disappointment at the French attitude and the accusations ranging from evasiveness to bad faith.

[E 88/3/89] Consul MacKereth to Mr, Eden.—(Received January 5, 1937.) (No. 93.) Sir, Damascus, December 31, 1936. THE question, which the Turkish Government has raised, concerning the future of the Sanjak of Alexandretta was referred to in the Syrian Parliament during the recent discussions that preceded the ratification of the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Alliance. On the whole, comment was made in very moderate terms and amounted to little more than expressions of astonishment that Turkey should to-day profess such altruistic concern for a small Turkish-speaking group which had, in fact, very little, if any, claim to be of Turkish race. Some speakers referred to what they stated was the case that the region of Mardine was inhabited by people of pure Arab stock speaking Arabic. They observed no suggestion by Turkey that this region should be lopped off Turkey to be placed under the aegis of the League of Nations or to be incorporated into Syria. 2. The President of the Council, Jamil Mardam. told me the other day in conversation that the Syrian Government would never consent to the removal of the sanjak from Syrian sovereignty; to do so would be to bring disaster to the district of Aleppo, which had already lost much of its prosperity owing to its being cut off from its natural hinterland and market by the near-by Syrio- Turkish frontier. He said he had no faith whatsoever in the Turkish protes tations that she was not seeking territorial expansion. Knowing the Turks and their patient method of diplomatic manoeuvre, Jamil Mardam sketched the steps by which Turkey, wearing a halo of self-righteousness and political rectitude, would eventually seek to occupy militarily (subsequently to the departure of the French garrisons in the Alawite territory five years after ratification of the Franco-Syrian Treaty) the Alexandretta Sanjak and then cast covetous eyes upon Mosul. I will not weary you with Jamil Mardam’s exposition, for it presupposed a Turkish machiavellism that it might seem absurd to attribute to a modern Turkey that has shed its Ottoman skin. 3. There have been several popular, but peaceable, hostile demonstrations before the Turkish consulate in Damascus; they were rapidly dispersed by the police. 4.

No. 4. 22nd January, 19 5 7 ■ Following from Secretary of state: Monsieur Aras discussed Alexandretta with me this afternoon, ue scaiced oy con laining at attitude of French Government which in his view was introducing an unnecessary bitterness into the controversy. Not only was French press making unfounded charges against his Government but French Ambassador in hoscow was representing to Soviet Government that Turkish Government were pressing their claim in respect of the Sanjak at the instigation of Gorman Government. At the same time French Ambassador at Angora was trying to make play with possible Italian reactions to any alteration of the status quo in this area. I ieplied tnat ne need not taxe all this too seriously. As foi as I knew french press had dealt with question very moderately but even if they had not there would have been no reason to take txieii tone too tragically. What was much more important to my iuinu v/&amp;s tne tension which appeared to be developing here and possible consequences of any lack of moderation in Turkish attitude. I would not conteal from him that as to this I was giavely perturbed* Turkey had hitherto given an admirable example to Europe by the legality and correctness of her policy. It would be a great mistime if she were now to adopt another line. Question at issue was not -mreiy a Franc 0 -Turkish one but one of general interest and indeed 0116 Wil ^ G ^ V;e ourselves were closely concerned. We attached the greatestV greatest importance to.a friendly settlement being readied. I fe^c I could speak irankly to niu on tms point as tiieie v/as no country v/ith wliom oui* relations ueie better. I told monsieur nr as tnat i Had seen icons i eur Blum last mgnt iii car is and tnat he had snosn to me proposals vhiich he had just made to Turkisii Government. (For suinmary see my tele-ram ho. 3). It seemed to me that monsieur Blum had gone very far indeed - oernaps even fui-tner than I should have in his place - to meet the wishes of tne Turks and I begged Monsieur Aias in ail friendliness not to miss tins particularly favourable opportunity of reaching a satis factory settlement and to give one more example of Turkey's statesmanlike and pacific policy. Monsieur liras then produced a copy of Monsieur Blum's proposals (text of which I had not yet seen) together v/ith text of Turkish questionnaire and French delegation's replies and tried to develop distinction on which luxicisn delegation are insisting between 'provisional* regime and _)Cxim,. p-ieu to emancipation of byria and permanent regime to be instituted thereafter. This point is fully dealt with in French reply. Monsieur mas repeated that his written questions related only to what he called provisional regime. Monsieur Aras continued that he thought it possible tnat agj.ei.ment might De reached at present session in regard to v.hat he caned provisional regime but saw no hope of agreement for a permanent regime. Indeed he contended that Council vere not a suitable body to deal with this. he then suggested that ideal solution would be for his Majesty's Government to 'arbitrate' between French and Turks on tne understand ing however (1) that their eventual award should be a compromise between immisn claim for an independent oanjak in a Syrian confederation5c confederation and French proposal for a virtual continue nee in banjak of present jiandute system and (&amp;.) that in reacnin- their eventual decision ris majesty's G-oveimient snould be guided (a) by treaty position and (b) by experience gained during tne operation of provisional regime*, monsieur hras ended by again emphasising, conylete confidence which his Governiiient placed in his najesty's boverri:-. nt aho had always been tneir truest and best friend and had proved friendshi: so signally by manner in which they had kept iu, ash Govern .ent fully informed of tneir- negotiations with Italian Govcrnnent.

Sir, With reference to my telegram No,2 of January 11th 193 f , and my Despatch No,3 of the same date, I have the honour to report that a situation of some delicacy now exists at Antioch. 2. On Saturday last, January 9th, a Turkish demonstration nearly a thousand strong paraded before the notel du Tourisme at Antioch where the League of Nations observers are now staying. They acclaimed Kemal Ataturk and demanded separation from Syria. 3. As a counter-blast to this demonstration a monster mee cin^ w^.s organised on Monday, January 11th, by the Syrian Nationalists, not without considerable support from the French authorities. Some ten thousand Arabs were collected from neighbouring villages and marched to Antioch where they massed outside the Hotel du Tourisme and shouted for the incorporation of the Sanjak in Syria. They dispersed v/ithout disorder. 4. The Turks, feeling that in numbers at least they nad been outclassed by the Arabs, organised a more numerous mass meeting for yesterday, January 12th. About three thousand demonstrators collected. The manifestation was timed to begin at ten a.m. but owing to the pouring rain did not actually take place till one p..m. when the League observers were at the French The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C.,i:.P. , euC., etc., etc. /ResidencyResidency. The demonstrators attempted to go to the Arab quarter of the town but their entrance was opposed by the Alc.cuite women. Seeing this, their leaders called them off and persuaded them to go to the Residency which is in the Turkish quarter. Thus the demonstration, which at one moment threatened to take an ugly turn, finally ended peacefully. 5. The authorities at Antioch are very nervous a s a result of all these political manifestations and are now trying their utmost to discourage further demonstrations. Tne population too are very disturbed and all shops, Turkish as well as Arab and Christian, have scarcely been open at all for days past. The atmosphere is such that any little incident might provoke a serious breach of the peace. 6.

I HAVE the honour, with reference to my telegra m No. 195 of the 26th December, to inform you that one of the manifestations'oi popular feeling in regard to the question of Alexandretta and Antioch has been the formation, in Istanbul and other provincial centres, of “ Hatay Associations ” or “ Hatay Independence Committees,” whose activities have received some prominence in the Turkish press. The word “ Hatay,” which a few months back formed no part of the Turkish vocabulary, is now familiar to every Turk as meaning an inhabitant of the sanjak, i.e., a Hittite, much labour having been expended by Turkish propagandists in proving the descent of the modern Turk in that region from the Hittites or Hatti who previously occupied it. 2. These Hatay Associations, of which the members are natives of the sanjak living in Turkey, have set up headquarters in the towns where they exist; they fly the “ Hatay ” flag (which appears to be identical with the Turkish national flag except that the star, instead of being white, is red surrounded by a narrow white border), and sing the “ Hatay ” anthem, the cadences of which are stated to differ only slightly from those of the Turkish national hymn. 3. The ceremonial opening of the “ Hatay Association ” at Istanbul on the 27th December was attended by enthusiastic crowds, composed mostly of university students and senior schoolboys. A similar movement in the Mersin district forms the subject of my telegram No. 1. Saving, of to-day’s date. 4. I would add that the press (the Republique in particular) is showing- evidence of rising temper, and there have been references to the desirability of Turkey’s turning her back on Geneva if she does not receive satisfaction, and of her settling the problem in her own way and at her own time. I am able to inform you, however, that I have ascertained from an authoritative Turkish source that these rather unguarded threats represent neither the policy of the Turkish Government nor the ideas of M. Ataturk. They need only therefore be taken as an escape of steam, which, for internal reasons, the Government did not at the time wish to prevent. Latterly this newspaper’s tone has become more moderate. I have, &amp;c. PERCY LORAINE. [906 1—2]COPY 19 57 nJ DIST RIBU TION (E 217/3/89) Decypher. Sir P. Loraine (Angora). 5th January, 1937 D.

C Sir, Angora, December 31, 1936. 0 1 HAVE the honour, with reference to my telegram No. 194 o f the 27th December, to acquaint you with the substance of a statement which the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs is reported in the Turkish press to have made, at a meeting of the parliamentary group of the People’s party on the 29th December, on the subject of Alexandretta and Antioch. 2. M. Stikru Saracoglu said that the proposals put forward by Dr. Aras in the course of the Turco-French conversations at Paris might be summarised as follows:— (1) Complete independence for the sanjak. (2) The formation of a federation comprising Syria, the Lebanon and an independent sanjak. (3) Demilitarisation of the sanjak. (4) Lease of part of the harbour of Alexandretta to Turkey, and the conclusion of a railway agreement. Dr. Aras had insisted that the sanjak should be granted full independence, while the French had talked of a wide measure of autonomy for that region, which would, however, owe “ allegiance ” to Syria. Since both sides maintained their point of view, negotiations were broken off. 3. M. Saracoglu is reported to have added that Dr. Aras had had conversations in Paris with M. Blum and several other French statesmen. A renewal of contact after the new year had been mentioned, but as regards the prospects of these further conversations and their probable results M. Saracoglu declared that he had maintained an attitude of reserve. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris. [906 g—2] I have, Ac.

After the arrival of the League of Nations observers at Antioch orompt steos were taken by the French to withdraw the reinforcements recently sent into the Sanjak of Alexandretta. On January 2nd. when I returned from Alexandretta to Aleppo six armoured cars and ten lorries containing troops were observed on the road between Antioch and Aleppo. 4. On the occasion of the visit of the League of Nations observers to Alexandretta on January 4th. a demonstration was staged by the nro-Turkish party outside the French Delegate’s residence.. The demonstration, in which some three hundred men took part, demanded the independence of Alexandretta. Immediately afterwards a counter-demonstration was staged by the Syrian Nationalists with equal success. Fortunately, good discipline was maintained by both parties and there were no disorders. 3.

I saw the Minister for .oieign iMfairs yesterday evening at his reouest and found that Turkish mistrust of French goodwill had unfortunately been reawakened by three things; (A) French press, which was preaching necessity of bringing Turkey to her senses. (5) Fro-Syrian demonstrations in Sanjak which he strongly suspects French local authorities of encouraging and helping, in order to impress the League observers and (C) Press telegram announcing French naval manoeuvres which Turkey could not fail to consider and treat as a deliberate provocation if they took olace in eastern basin of the Mediterranean. 2. Furthermore His Excellency had this morning seen Italian Ambassador who has just returned to Angora via Paris. My Italian colleague told him (A) that Paris press was obviously stirring up bad feeling between France and Turkey, (B) That in the opinion of the Italian Ambassador in Paris French Grovernment would never agree to a compromise settlement of Sanjak question until Turkey showed her teeth; and he gave definite assurance (C) that Italy had no intention whatever of taking France’s place in Syria, in contra diction of reports to that effect being circulated in Paris in cvc to frighten Turkey, and (D) of Italy's complete sympathy for furlh w national cause in the Sanjak affair. 17 Ofto u % 5.

Attitude of Soviet Cover risers is that while they would dislike any serious friction between trance and Turkey they also hone that a solution satisfactory wo Turkish national feelings will be reached. 5. Balkan Entente sympathies are with Turkey. Thus His Excellency reasoned the United kingdom was France’s only remaining friend in the Sanjak issue. His Excellency under stood and anorecic ted why this was so and circumstance caused him no anxiety at all: it even strengthened his wish that if it came to mediation the mediation should be British, for he and his country had complete faith in British sense of justice. If Turkey had proceeded with moderation in this question it was because sue valued so highly the good opinion of her British friend, fne willingness you had expressed wo Turkish Ambassador on January 7in (your telegram no. 9 , paragraph t) to do anything you count to bring •bout a solution had caused lively satisiaction to rim himself and Turkish Government.

Copy No.176 Franco-Turkish Dispute over the Sanjak of Alexandretta. Part I .—Nature and Origins of the Dispute. THIS administrative district at present forms part of the Territories of the Levant under French mandate, and is situated in the angle formed by the eastern shore of the Mediterranean and the Turco-Syrian frontier. It consists of three distinct regions : (a) A narrow coastal plain, with the town of Alexandretta and its excellent roadstead (said to be the best sheltered anchorage for many hundred miles in either direction), backed by the Amanus chain of mountains, forming a barrier broken only by the important Beilan pass; (ft) the lower valley of the River Orontes, with the town of Antioch and a hill area on the south; {c) a wide marshy plain, running north from Antioch to the Turkish frontier. The district has little value, apart from the potential importance of Alexandretta as a mercantile port which could serve an extensive belt of territory running astride the Turkish-Syrian frontier eastwards into northern Iraq and north-west Persia, or as a possible naval base. 2. The population of the sanjak appears to he about 220,000, comprising a heterogeneous collection of races and creeds. The largest individual element in it is certainly Turkish-speaking, although it is very doubtful whether this element (which in any case is doubtfully of pure Turkish race) either constitutes a majority in the territory or is as a whole favourable to the present regime in Turkey, since its culture and traditions have hitherto remained those of the old Islamic Ottoman Empire, as contrasted with Kemalist Turkey. The following statistics for the sanjak, calculated on a racial and religious basis, are given by the French Government:— Turks (Sunni Moslems) Alawites (“Arab” race) ... 85,242 62,026 Armenians ... ... ... .... 24,911 Arabs (Sunni Moslems) 22,461 Christians (other than Armenians) 18,051 Circassians 954 Jews ... 474 Others ... 129 Total ... ... ... ... 219,080 The Turkish Government deny the accuracy of these statistics, asserting that there are at least 150.000 Turks, including almost all of those listed as “ Alawites ” by religion. 3. The present dispute between the French and Turkish Governments over the future of the sanjak arises from divergent interpretations of the international instruments which settled the fate of this district in the years immediately after the war. The coastal districts of Syria and Cilicia were reserved to France by the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916, but they were occupied by British troops after the armistice of Mudros with Turkey. In the autumn of 1919 the British troops gave way to the French under General Gouraud. Meanwhile, in July 1919, the principles of mandates for ££ colonies and territories which, as a consequence of the late war, have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which formerly governed them ” was enshrined in article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. France was then accorded an ££ A ” type mandate over “ Syria ” by the Supreme Council of the Allied Powers in April 1920 at the San Remo Conference. The terms of the actual mandate (which now specified ££ Syria ” and ££ the Lebanon ”) were subsequently laid down in the document 8997 [14420] bapproved by the League Council in July 1922. When the Syrian mandate was attributed io France in 1920, the Near East was, however, still in a state of turmoil and uncertainty, and it was impossible to fix the territorial limits covered by the mandate; nor does the actual mandatory document of 1922 attempt any geographical definition of 11 Syria.’' 4. The Treaty of Sevres signed in August 1920 fixed the Turkish-Syria^ frontier well to the north of the present line. But it was rejected by the Turkish nationalists, and after severe fighting between the French forces and Turkish bands the frontier was finally fixed on a more southerly line by the Franco- Turkish Bilateral Agreement of October 1921 (the notorious Franklin-Bouillon Treaty), which prescribed a definite line to the north of which the Turkish troops were to be withdrawn. At the same time, article 7 of this agreement postulated that “un regime administratif special sera institue pour la region d’Alexandrette. Les habitants de race turque de cette region jouiront de toutes les facilites pour le developpement de leur culture. La langue turque y aura le caractere officiel.” A letter was also written by the French delegate to the head of the Turkish delegation recording the intention of the French Government to give effect to article 7 by confiding, as a general rule, the administration of regions with a Turkish majority to officials of Turkish race, and by setting up schools to encourage the development of Turkish culture. Further, in the signed “ protocol of signature ' M. Franklin-Bouillon promised, inter alia, to recommend to his Government the Turkish claims that the sanjak should be allowed a special flag containing the Turkish flag, and that an area should be leased to Turkey in the port of Alexandretta for the use of goods in transit to Turkey. Turkey has, however, so far failed to follow up these concessions, which have remained a dead letter. (Note.— Nowhere in the 1921 treaty is there any direct mention of the position of France as mandatory over Syria; at the same time there are references in the text of the treaty to ‘ ‘ Syria ’ ’ as the State which Turkey would have to deal with south of the frontier as fixed.) 5. The frontier laid down in the 1921 treaty was subsequently adopted and confirmed by article 3 of the Treaty of Lausanne (signed in July 1923) in respect of the frontier between the new Turkish State and Syria. By article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne : 1 La Turquie declare renoncer a tous droits et titres, de quelque nature que ce soit, sur ou concernant les territoires situes an dela des frontieres prdvues par le present traite et sur les lies autres que cedes sur lesquelles la souverainete lui est reconnue par ledit traite, le sort de ces territoires et lies etant regie ou a regler par les interesses. Les dispositions du present article ne portent pas atteinte aux stipulations particulieres intervenues ou a intervenir entre la Turquie et les pays limitrophes en raison de leur voisinage.” At the same time a bilateral exchange of letters between the French and Turkish delegations put it specifically on record that nothing in the new treaty should be held to invalidate the stipulations of the Franco-Turkish Treaty of 1921. The Turks insisted on a similar precaution at the time of the signature of the subsequent Franco-Turkish Treaty of May 1926, which supplemented and clarified the provisions of the previous treaty of October 1921; a protocol was concluded between the two Governments recording that the new treaty should not be held in any way to change the state of affairs brought into being by the 1921 treaty, and that, in particular, account would always be taken of the special regime for the district of Alexandretta as stipulated by article 7 of the 1921 treaty. 6. The French did not fail to give effect to the promise made to the Turks in 1921, and a limited measure of administrative and financial, but not political, autonomy was brought into existence within the Sanjak of Alexandretta. At the same time the sanjak has always continued to form an integral part of the State of Syria, unlike the territories of Lattakia and the Jebel Druse, which, although remaining to some extent associated with Syria, were formally detached from Syrian sovereignty by decrees of the French High Commissioner. The regime at present existing in the sanjak is prescribed by a “ statute ” of 1930, which forms part of the organic law of the State of Syria. This statute provides for a measure of local control over the appointment of subordinate administrative officials; for an administrative council with a majority of elected members possessing power to vote a local budget; and for limited local financial autonomy, both as regards receipts and expenditure. The Governor of the sanjak and the local judges are, however, appointed directly by the head of the Syrian State.7. Until quite recently the Turkish Government appear to have been quite willing to accept the situation in the sanjak, and although they now allege that ever since 1921 they have continually complained of the insufficiency of the privileges given to the Turkish elements in the sanjak, no serious dispute ever arose. In fact, apart from the checks imposed by the French on the dissemination ^f “ Kemalist ' propaganda under the guise of the encouragement of “ Turkish ' culture, the Turkish elements appear, on a disinterested view 7 , to have received very favourable treatment. When, however, it became knowui that the French were negotiating with a Syrian delegation a treaty to emancipate Syria from mandate in accordance with the implications of article 22 of the Covenant and on the lines of the Anglo-Iraqi precedent, considerable anxiety was at once aroused in Turkey—an anxiety which was fanned into open agitation by an inspired press campaign and the public speeches of leading Turkish personalities. The publication in October of the terms of the draft Franco-Syrian treaty settlement increased this agitation, for, wffiether by accident or intention, it contains no specific safeguards for the position of the Turkish minority; the continuance of the existing special autonomous regime in the sanjak is only covered by implication through the obligation laid on the new 7 Syrian State to respect all international obligations (such, e.g., as article 7 of the Franco-Turkish agreement of 1921, as confirmed by the Treaty of Lausanne) entered into by the mandatory Power in respect of Syria. Part II.— Beginning and Development of the Dispute. 8. The anxiety of the Turkish Government was first formally expressed by the Turkish Foreign Minister at meetings of the League Council and Assembly in September and October last on the occasion of the French representative giving an outline of the proposals of his Government for the emancipation of Syria. M. Aras referred to the importance of the sanjak (which he represented as containing a considerable Turkish majority) receiving “ a treatment under which the population w 7 ould be able to manage its owm affairs,” and he asked for the agreement of the French to bilateral conversations regarding the future of the sanjak. In agreeing to these proposed conversations and giving a definite assurance that the French would arrange for the continuation under the new regime in Syria of the measure of autonomy at present enjoyed in the sanjak, the French representative, M. Vienot, made it clear that the conversations would have to take place “within the framework of the 1921 agreements,” i.e., that France was not agreeing to discuss any fundamental change in the status of the sanjak. ' 9 . When, however, the Turkish Government began the bilateral exchange of views by a note of the 10th October, 1936, they cast aside equivocation and formally invited the French Government to conclude with delegates of the population of “ the region of Alexandretta and Antioch ” (wffiom they described as being Turkish in great majority) a treaty analogous to those which the French w 7 ere proposing to conclude with the independent States of Syria and the Lebanon. This demand w 7 as categorically rejected by the French Government, and after seven notes had been exchanged and the attitude of the Turkish Govern ment had become increasingly intransigent, the parties agreed to the matter being referred to the Council of the League. The attitude of the two Govern ments, as set out in this lengthy correspondence^ 1 ) are summarised in the tw ? o following paragraphs. . 10. The Turkish Government began their case bv arguing that the autonomy of the region of the sanjak within the area of ex-Ottoman territory entrusted to the “mandate.” and authority of France was set up by the Franco-Turkish Treaty of October 1921 before the organisation of the rest of the mandated territories into the present States of Syria and the Lebanon; that there were no legal grounds for treating the sanjak merely as part of the Syrian State, and that if France were proposing to emancipate Syria and the Lebanon (a develop ment which Turkey welcomed in itself) she should a fortiori emancipate the sanjak as a separate unit, which had been made over to her by Turkey in 1921 under specific reservations in favour of local autonomy. In their second note they changed their line of attack to some extent by insisting that there had never (i) The texts of the notes themselves and of the relevant international instruments ars available in League print C.538.M.348 of the 10th December, 1936. [14420] B 2been any legal justification for including the sanjak in the territory of “ Syria ” over which France had received a mandate from the League. If the French Government persisted in maintaining the contrary, the Turkish Government would be obliged to consider their attitude a breach of the Franco-Turkish bilateral agreements of 1921 and 1926, and to hold themselves freed for their part also from the stipulations of those agreements. | 11. In rejecting the Turkish arguments the French Government pointed out that they had only undertaken to negotiate with the Turkish Government about the future of the sanjak within the framework of the 1921 Franco-Turkish Treaty, which they asserted was essentially an agreement for frontier delimita tion and for settling certain administrative questions which were called into being by the fact of such delimitation. They maintained that they had entirely fulfilled their obligation to set up a special administrative regime for the benefit of the Turkish-speaking population in the sanjak, and that the terms of the 1921 treaty would continue to be respected through this obligation being inherited by the Syrian State without any loss of their present rights to the inhabitants of the sanjak. The French Government claimed that in concluding the 1921 Franco- Turkish Agreement France had been acting as a mandatory Power; that the Sanjak of Alexandretta had always formed part of the Syrian State under mandate; that the terms of the mandate expressly forbade France to cede or lease any part of the territory covered by the mandate; and that they could not possibly agree to detach from the future sovereignty of Syria a portion of Syrian territory, since this would amount to a dismemberment of Syria and a flagrant breach of the mandate. The French Government took the view that only two courses were possible: either (a) bilateral negotiations for a clearer definition of the special rights and privileges of the sanjak within the framework of the 1921 agreements (i.e., without calling in question the political allegiance of the sanjak to Syria); or (b) if the Turkish Government insisted on demanding an independent status for the sanjak separate from Syria, reference to the Council of the League as the only body competent to modify the juridical status of mandated territory. 12. The Turkish Government agreed on the 4th December that the matter should be placed on the agenda of the next ordinary session of the Council in January 1937. Meanwhile, a tense situation in the sanjak had been steadily developing due (so far as can be judged from the conflicting evidence produced by both sides) to the agitation worked up among the Turkish elements in the sanjak by agents coming from Turkey with a view to preventing the local elections to the Syrian Chamber from being carried out. On the 1st December a riotous Turkish mob at Antioch was fired on by French troops and suffered casualties, including three persons killed. This event, coupled with certain restrictions imposed on local liberties in the interests of order, provoked an excited reaction in Turkey, fanned by violent speeches made by prominent Turks (including the Prime Minister, General Ismet Inonii). On their side, the French Government became alarmed at reports that Turkish bands were being formed on the frontier, and they accordingly suggested that the matter should be placed on the agenda of the extraordinary session of the Council called for mid-December to deal with the Spanish situation. Acting on this suggestion, the Turkish Government formally requested on the 8th December that the dispute concerning the districts of Alexandretta and Antioch “conditionally ceded by Turkey in 1921 and 1923 should be placed on the agenda of the forthcoming session under article 11 of the Covenant, and that, in particular, the Council should take urgent conservatory measures to safeguard the lives and liberties of the Turkish elements in the sanjak. The French Government telegraphed their concurrence in this request, subject to a complete reservation regarding the Turkish allegation as to the situation in the sanjak. They also stated that they did not consider the matter to be a Franco-Turkish dispute, but rather a divergence between a Turkish request and the League’s doctrine in regard to mandated territory. Part III.— Attitude of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. 13. At this juncture the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs explained to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora the point of view of his Government and the sort of solution which they had in mind. M. Aras confirmed the assurances which spokesmen of the Turkish Government had already given publicly that Turkey had no territorial ambitions of her own in regard to the5 sanjak and did not seek any revision of the existing frontier as laid down by the kranco-Turkish Treaty of i921 and confirmed by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. He said, however, that the Turkish Government were aiming at a permanent solution of the future of the sanjak in the form of an autonomous demilitarised area, under the “general aegis” of the League of Nations, the neutrality and ^demilitarisation of which would be guaranteed by neighbouring States as well as by France, the United Kingdom, and possibly other Powers. At the same time the potential value of the port of Alexandretta would be greatly developed to serve the interests of all neighbouring and economically interested States. 14. For their part the French Government also lost no time in lobbying His Majesty’s Government. The counsellor to the French Embassy in London called at the Foreign Office on the 9th December on instructions and gave an explanation (supported by an aide-memoire), explaining why the French Govern ment could not agree to what would amount to the dismemberment of Syria in violation of the mandate. Moreover, the recent Franco-Syrian reconciliation and their proposed alliance would be jeopardised if France, as mandatory Power, allowed the sanjak to be detached from Syria. M. Gambon expressed the hope of his Government that the United Kingdom representative on the Council would support the French thesis in the Council in view of the common interest of the two countries in retaining the goodwill of the Arab world. 15. In these circumstances urgent consideration was given in the Foreign Office to the policy which His Majesty’s Government should adopt towards the dispute. The conclusion was soon reached that the Turks had no justification in law for their claims. The legal position in regard to sovereignty over the sanjak was governed by the Treaty of Lausanne, in article 3 of which the frontier between Turkey and Syria was defined as being the line fixed in the Franco- Turkish Treaty of 1921, and by article 16 of which “ la Turquie declare renoncer a tons droits et titres, de quelque nature que ce soit, sur ou concernant les terri- toires situes au dela des frontieres prevues par le present traite et sur les lies autres que celles sur lesquelles la souverainete lui est reconnue par ledit traite, le sort de ces territoires et lies etant regie ou a regler par les interesses.” This renunciation was indeed made subject to the provision in the second paragraph of the same article, which runs as follows : “ Les dispositions du present article ne portent pas atteinte aux stipulations particulieres intervenues ou a intervenir entre la Turquie et les pays limitrophes en raison de leur voisinage,” i.e., in the case of the sanjak article 7 of the 1921 treaty. But as article 7 of the 1921 treaty merely provided for the establishment of a £ ‘ special administrative regime ” in the district of Alexandretta, it could not alter the essential fact that Turkey had lost all sovereignty over the sanjak by virtue of the Treaty of Lausanne, and that accordingly arrangements for its future status (provided that the provisions of article 7 were complied with) did not require Turkish acceptance. The position was that Turkish rights as regards the administration of the sanjak only derived from the Franco-Turkish Treaty of 1921 in so far as its provisions were reaffirmed in the Treaty of Lausanne. No interpretation of article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne could give Turkey the right to press for the separation of the sanjak from Syria, or, in fact, to demand more than the continuance of a special local regime for the Turkish minority in the sanjak provided for in the 1921 treaty. 16. The Turkish contention that the sanjak did not come within the scope of the mandate for Syria was considered to be equally unsound. Turkey had automatically accepted the whole mandate system as expressed in article 22 of the Covenant, when she entered the League; she had consequently accepted the French mandate over the Levant States, their establishment and organisation under the mandate and also the prospect of their eventual political emancipation, in accordance with the terms of article 22 in regard to “ A ” type mandates. 17. Apart from the unsoundness of their legal position, the conclusion was reached that the proposals of the Turkish Government for detaching the sanjak from Syrian sovereignty were open to the following very serious 'political objections : — (a) Even if the Turks in fact cherished no immediate territorial ambitions, it was probable that the separation of the sanjak from Syria would eventually drive it into the arms of Turkey. In any case a breach was likely to be caused in the territorial status quo of the Near andMiddle East, which might well lead to further demands for territorial revision in that part of the world. In particular, if the Turks were successful over Alexandretta it might easily encourage them to try to expand further south and south-east at the expense of Syria and Iraq towards the Iraqi oil-fields). (&amp;) The sanjak possessed neither racial, linguistic, geographical nor economic cohesion, and would scarcely be able to maintain an independent existence. It would inevitably be subject to propaganda from both the Turkish and Syrian sides, and even if its ultimate absorption in Turkey were avoided it would be a constant element of international unrest. (c) Any revision of the territorial status of the sanjak would inevitably arouse the suspicions of Italy if not of other Powers. It would introduce a further element of instability and danger in international relations in the Mediterranean and render the re-establishment of a peaceful atmosphere there much more difficult. The fact that Alexandretta is a valuable potential naval base is important in this connexion. {d) It would inevitably have unfortunate repercussions in Syria. It would deprive Aleppo and North-West Syria of its natural outlet to the sea and make it more difficult for the new Syrian State to retain its hold on that part of Syria. Further, the psychological effect on the Syrian Arabs and on the Arab world in general would be most unfortunate and might easily wreck the whole Franco-Syrian Treaty settlement. As the French had pointed out (paragraph 14 above), such a deterioration in Syria could not fail to affect the interests of His Majesty’s Government in Arab countries, as well as those of the French Government. (e) In view of the ruthlessly totalitarian character of the modern Turkish State, the future position of the large Christian and other minorities in the sanjak would be most precarious if the sanjak were either incorporated in Turkey or subjected to an administration dominated by Turkish influence, and a new refugee problem of formidable proportions might well be created. (/) The political dependence of Turkey on Russia and the fact that Alexandretta could now be joined without great difficulty by a direct railway to Russian Transcaucasia would be likely to raise suspicions of a Russian desire for a new direct outlet to the Mediterranean. (#) The example of Danzig and other territories which could not stand by themselves had shown the objections which would apply in practice to any sort of League or other international guarantee, or for an independent sanjak. (A) Experience has shown that demilitarisation arrangements are of no permanent value and can always be repudiated or abolished by agreement without difficulty on the ground that they are no longer appropriate to changed conditions. 18 18. While it was fully appreciated that every effort must be made to avoid any weakening of the cordial friendship existing between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Turkish Government, the conclusion was reached that in the light both of the weakness of the Turkish legal case and of the strong political objections to the Turkish claim, His Majesty’s Government would be obliged, if the Turks persisted with their demand for the detachment of the sanjak, to oppose the Turkish thesis. It was considered that it would be preferable in the interests of Anglo-Turkish friendship to warn the Turks frankly and privately of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government before the matter came to the Council, and instructions in this sense were sent by telegraph to the United Kingdom delegate at Geneva. Lord Cranborne was instructed to explain that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the motives of the Turkish proposal and would be ready to support any measures merely designed to guarantee the rights and liberties of the Turkish population of the sanjak. They considered, however, that the proposal for detaching the sanjak from Syria could not fail to lead to serious and far-reaching political difficulties, and also to impair the re-establishment of normal conditions in the Mediterranean.1 art IV. Developments during the Extraordinary Session of the League Council at Geneva in December 1936. 19. When Lord (Jranborne called on the Turkish Foreign Minister at Geneva on the 14th December to act on these instructions, M. Aras informed him ^iat the lurkish Government were now in agreement that any decision on the Substance of the question should be left over until the meeting of the Council in January 1937, and that the Council should concentrate at its present session upon the necessary temporary measures to ensure and supervise the maintenance of law and order in the territory. M. Aras, who was in a rather aggressive mood, went on to outline the views of the Turkish Government on the substance of the dispute, as well as their proposals for conservatory measures, prominent among which were an international enquiry into recent events, and the despatch of a small inter national force to the sanjak. He hinted in rather a sinister manner that if the French did not accept these proposals, and if further incidents occurred in the sanjak, Turkey would he in a position to concentrate three army corps on the frontier so as to protect the Turkish elements in the sanjak. 20. Lord Cranborne drew M. Aras’s attention to the obvious difficulties in the way of sending any international force to the sanjak. He then went on to inform him of the view which His Majesty’s Government took of the dispute, and to warn him that they would be obliged to oppose the separation of the sanjak from Syria. Lord Cranborne thought it better to inform M. Aras of this quite frankly, as His Majesty’s Government were most anxious not to be obliged to oppose Turkey publicly at the Council. He explained that although His Majesty’s Government were not directly concerned in the dispute they had a direct interest in seeing that nothing occurred to trouble the peace of the Near East. M. Aras took Lord Cranborne’s remarks in good part and professed entirely to recognise the position of His Majesty’s Government; he expressed the hope that they would give both sides the benefit of their benevolent advice. 21. The consideration of the question was begun in the League Council on the afternoon of the 14th December. (Note: Although the speeches of the Turkish and French delegates covered to some extent the same ground as the summary of the previous diplomatic correspondence in paragraphs 11-12 above, they are comprehensively summarised below for convenience and for purposes of record.) The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs was the first speaker, and although professing the intention to deal fully with the substance of the question at a later date, he embarked immediately upon an exposition of the Turkish case. His argument was based on the contention that the sanjak had never been included within the scope of the mandate for Syria, that it had been handed over by Turkey directly to France in 1921 on specific conditions, and that it was now entitled to its freedom since France was proposing to withdraw as mandatory. He made play with the point that if the mandate over “ Syria ” allocated by the Supreme Council to France in 1920 had been intended to cover territories inhabited by the Turks as well as Lebanese and Arabs, it would inevitably have applied also to large areas of Turkish territory in Cilicia then also under French occupation. The fact that this was not so was shown according to M. Aras by the fact that the French were able in October 1921 to negotiate a bilateral treaty with Turkey, by which they surrendered all territory in their occupation inhabited by Turks, except the sanjak, which they retained on conditions. M. Aras went on to main tain that the mandatory document of 1922 confirmed the Turkish thesis by its failure to mention the sanjak and its special regime, and also that the conditional nature of the cession of the sanjak had been confirmed by the proceedings at the Lausanne Conference in 1923, where the Turkish delegation had insisted on the present wording of the second paragraph of article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne (see paragraph 5 above) qualifying the renunciation of Turkish rights and title. M. Aras denied that the Turkish initiative would create a State which could not stand by itself : as regards the charge that it would dismember Syria, he asserted that the League had already allowed this to happen through the division of the original territory of “ Syria ” into the States of Syria and the Lebanon. 22. Turning to the current situation in the sanjak, M. Aras asserted that the Turkish population—whose fate would always be of interest to Turkey—had been the victims of a bloody repression simply for expressing their opinions. The territory was being held down by force, and, in order to create a favourable atmosphere for the examination of the substance of the dispute, the TurkishGovernment proposed that the League should itself take the “ destim ” of the sanjak into its hands. As a specific conservatory measure the Turkish Govern ment wished to see the withdrawal of the French and of the native troops at present in the sanjak and its occupation by an international force under a League Commissioner. At the same time they considered it necessary that neither France nor Syria should do anything calculated to change the position of the territory^ 23. After mutual assurances of their friendly feelings towards each othei by the representatives of Turkey and France, the Council proceeded to appoint the Swedish Foreign Minister, M. Sandler, as rapporteur for the question and then to adjourn. 24. On the 15th December the French Representative made a long speech of reply in the Council. M. Vienot stated that the French Government could not accept the Turkish thesis, since they regarded article 22 of the League Covenant, and the decision of the Supreme Council allotting the mandate in 1920. a&amp; defining the juridical position of France in all ex-Ottoman territory which had passed under her control. France had acquired no sovereignty over this territory, but merely a mission to develop it in accordance with the mandatory principle. When the mandate was allotted in 1920 it was necessarily left to France to organise the administration and to conclude the necessary agreements to fix the frontiers; one of these agreements was the Franco-Turkish Agreement of 1921 which was confirmed by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. The fact that France had been in military occupation of Cilicia after the war was a question of fact which could not be held to fix a binding legal frontier; the legal frontier on the north of the territory allotted to French mandate first came into existence in the Franco-Turkish treaty of 1921. The fact that it was necessary in article 7 of that treaty to provide guarantees in favour of the Turkish population actually proved the intention to embody the sanjak in a wider non-Turkish State. M. Vienot summed up as follows : In 1921 France had negotiated, and could only negotiate, with Turkey in her capacity as mandatory for Syria; she had never received any direct sovereignty over the sanjak and could not have assumed it through an agreement for frontier delimitation; and the sanjak had no special juridical claim to independence outside Syria. In any case, he added, the Turkish Government had not taken exception throughout the last fifteen years to the treatment given to the i urkish elements in the sanjak or to the participation of the territory in the national life of Syria. For its part the League Council had m 1930 approved the Organic Law of Syria, which embodied the existing special administrative statute of the sanjak. 25. Turning to the future, M. Vienot pointed out that, pending the proposed entry into force of the Franco-Syrian draft treaty settlement on the entry of Syria into the League in three years time, Turkey would have full opportunity to make objections and to propose amendments in the course of the detailed consideration of the Franco-Syrian settlement by the organs of the League. In any case the settlement as drafted could not affect the existing rights of the Turks in the sanjak, since the new Syrian State was contracting, vis-a-vis France, to respect international obligations entered into on its behalf in the past by the mandatory Power. For this reason it had not been necessary to make specific mention of the sanjak in the draft settlement. Furthermore, the population of the sanjak would benefit by the general minority guarantees embodied in a Franco-Syrian exchange of notes included in the treaty settlement; and he pointed out that the French Government would have the right’to intervene, if necessary , in support of those guarantees. 26. M. Vienot maintained that France had taken all necessary precautions vis-a-vis the Syrians to safeguard the rights of the population in the sanjak. ISievei theless, as a token of their friendship towards the Turkish Government, the French Government would have been ready to offer further guarantees through the medium of an additional Franco-Syrian exchange of letters. But the Turkish Government were demanding the erection of the sanjak into an independent State, a proposal which was inacceptable to the French Government, as it went far beyond the scope of the 1921 treaty and came into direct conflict with the mandatory document of 1922, which referred only to States of Syria and the Lebanon. France had no sovereignty over the sanjak, and could not possibly negotiate an agreement which would conflict with the terms of the mandate and with the principles laid down from time to time by the League, e.g., the decision of the Permanent Mandates Commission at its 24th session (approved by theLeague Council in January 1924), specifically excluding, as incompatible with the mandate, any idea of erecting a third independent territorial unit within the mandated territories. 27. M. Vienot observed that the Council was capable of changing the present juridical position. The French Government felt obliged, however, to draw ^Attention to the grave practical risks which any such modification would entail m the present case. The unity of Syrian territory was a fundamental principle of the Franco-Syrian settlement, and the amputation of sanjak at this stage would cause consternation among the whole Arab world, which might easily lead to further grave troubles in the Middle East. 28. M. Vienot went on to express surprise at M. Aras’s allegations about the present condition of the Turkish population in the sanjak. Small military reinforcements had been sent there in view of the provocative incidents which had taken place, and also to supervise the frontier. As justification for the precautions taken by the mandatory authorities, M. Vienot referred to a speech by the Turkish Prime Minister on the 13th December, containing an allusion to the risk of a very “ embarrassing ” situation suddenly developing over the sanjak. He said that the French Government were prepared to agree to conservatory measures to avoid incidents on the frontier or in the sanjak, and they therefore suggested the despatch of neutral observers to each side of the boundary. They could not. however, agree to any measures which would encroach on the mandatory authority of France, particularly as regards the maintenance of order. M. Vienot felt that the Council would in any case wish to avoid any such measures, which could only prejudge the substance of the question and cause resentment in Syria. 29. The Council adjourned again shortly after M. Vienot’s speech and the interval between the next meeting of the Council was given over to discussions between the parties and rayforteur with the object of reaching agreement about conservatory measures. The French showed a disposition to make concessions; the Turks, on the other hand, proved very obstinate. They first insisted on the “ neutralisation ' of the sanjak, and an enquiry into past events; they eventually retreated from their position to the extent of half-agreeing to the French proposal for an international mission of “observers’' to the sanjak, provided that it contained a Turkish member. This, however, the French would not accept, as they feared that not only his intrigues, but also his mere presence, might give the impression to the population that Turkey was already taking over control. Even then it is said that M. Aras was personally ready to accept the French proposals. He was, however, overruled on reference to Angora, and the refusal of the Turkish Government to accept them was, significantly enough, notified at a meeting at the League Secretariat not by M. Aras himself, but by the chief secretary of the Turkish President, a certain Hassan Riza Soyak. who made an unfavourable impression by his brusque and uncompromising attitude. The rapporteur had accordingly no alternative but to go ahead without Turkish agreement. 30. On the morning of the 16th December* the Council met again. The rapporteur read his report to the Council. He said that the parties were agreed in asking the Council to postpone an examination of the substance of the question until its next ordinary session in January 1937. As regards conservatory measures, the French representative had been unable to accept the proposed despatch to the sanjak of neutral gendarmerie under* a League Commissioner*, but had offered to agree to the following measures :— («) The despatch of “ observers ' to the sanjak alone (and not to the Turkish side of the frontier as well). (b) The postponement of the ratification of the Franco-Syrian Treaty by the French Government pending a decision by the Council on the substance of the question. (c) The withdrawal of the military reinforcements recently sent to the sanjak as soon as the observers had arrived. The Turkish representative had been unable to accept the French proposals, but had stated for his part that there was no question of any military steps being taken on the Turkish side of the frontier. 31. M. Sandler observed that it was thus impossible to reach agreement regarding conservatory measures. In view, however, of the French Government’s express request to that effect, he suggested that the Council should send to the [14420] c10 sanjak as soon as possible a mission of three observers, whose role would he defined in the following terms :— “ It should be understood that, according to the French proposal, the task of these observers would be neither to study the substance of the question nor to enquire into the events which may have occurred recently in the district of Alexandretta and Antioch. Nor will the observers have to take any action themselves with a view to the maintenance of order or the pacification of the state of mind of the population. Their duty will simply be to observe and to keep in touch with the facts in order to be able to inform the Council if necessary. 5 ' The rapporteur then proposed the following draft resolution : — “ The Council, “ (1) Noting that the Governments of France and Turkey have agreed to postpone to the Council’s ordinary session in January the examination of the substance of the question which has arisen regarding the distinct of Alexandretta and Antioch, recommends the two Governments to continue their conversations meanwhile in close contact with the rapporteur; “ (2) Notes the assurances given by the representatives of France and Turkey that they will spare no effort to contribute to a satisfactory solution of the question: “ (3) In response to the request formally made by the French Govern ment, decides to send as soon as possible to the Sanjak of Alexandretta three observers with the task defined in the present report; “ (4) Requests the President of the Council to appoint the said observers on the rapporteur's proposal; “ (5) Fixes the end of January 1937 as the maximum time-limit for the observers’ mission; “ (6) Requests the Secretary-General to provide the observers with the necessary secretarial staff; “ (7) Authorises the Secretary-General, under Rule 33 of the Financial Regulations, to draw, if necessary, on the working capital fund, up to a maximum of 75,000 Swiss francs, for the sums necessary to cover the expenditure involved by the execution of the present resolution, it being understood that France shall defray this expenditure; ££ (8) Stipulates that the adoption of the present resolution shall not be regarded as in any way prejudging the substance of the question, which remains entirely open.” 32. In the debate which followed, the Turkish Representative said that, although Turkey had decided to abstain from voting on the resolution, she would not hinder its adoption by voting against it and would continue to seek an amicable solution of the question. M. Aras recalled the proposals of his Govern ment as regards conservatory measures, and said that, if these proposals had been agreed to, the Turkish Government would have been ready to submit to the suggested enquiry into events, past and present, extending to its own territory, as well as the sanjak. They considered that a simple mission of observers would, not be able to form a correct picture of the position in the sanjak, since it could only obtain information from prejudiced local authorities. Even then the Turkish Government would have been willing to accept the French proposals provided the mission of enquiry included French and Turkish members as well as a neutral. The French Representative replied with the observation that the French request for a mission of neutral observers was an unprecedented concession by a mandatory Power. M. Vienot also pointed out that the conciliatory measures proposed by the rapporteur emanated entirely from the French Government. 33. The United Kingdom Representative drew attention to the special interest of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in this question. The United Kingdom was herself a mandatory Power; His Majesty’s Govern ment were most anxious that nothing should occur to disturb the political tranquillity of the Near East, and they had close and cordial friendship for both Governments concerned. His Majesty’s Government were convinced, in view of11 the very conciliatory spirit which had been displayed, that it would soon be possible to reach an amicable solution of the whole question. Meanwhile, they would vote for the resolution, while feeling obliged, in view of the capacity of the United Kingdom as the only other Power besides France still charged with an A mandate, to recall that it was a fundamental principle of the mandatory stem that the mandatory Power is responsible for the maintenance of order in mandated territory. In the present case, however, the mandatory Power had itself expressly and formally requested the despatch of a mission of observers. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government were prepared to agree to the proposal, particularly as the procedure proposed in the present case (which arose out of a difference of opinion in the interpretation of a treaty between the mandatory Power and another State) could not be considered as forming any precedent in respect of purely internal events within a mandated territory. 34. The rapporteur’s report and draft resolution were adopted by the Council with the abstention of Turkey, and the session of the Council was brought to a close. 35. The Turkish delegation were understood to be distinctly disappointed at the way in which matters developed at Geneva and generally at the lack of sympathy which they found for their case, particularly in the French delegation and the rapporteur. M. Aras himself was evidently actuated mainly by fear for his personal position in Turkey, and the real master of the Turkish delegation appeared to be rather the Ghazi’s secretary (see paragraph 29 above), who is said to have referred complacently in conversation to the prospect of the Aleppo district being detached from Syria together with the sanjak. In general the handling of the negotiations by the Turkish delegation gave the impression that the ultimate object of their Government was rather imperialist expansion than safeguards for a Furkish minority. 36. On the othei hand, it is worth recording that m private conversation the able Turkish Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (M. Numan Menemencioglu) stated that while the Turkish Government felt very deeply about the question and could never agree to the handing over of a Turkish population to an Arab State, they had no intention of taking drastic steps which would lead to a rupture with France. He hinted that if the Turkish Government could not get their way they might prefer to leave the whole question of the future of the sanjak in suspense on a de facto basis, although this would inevitably poison their relations with Syria. 37. So far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned, thev were, however, able to retain good relations with both parties during the proceedings at Geneva! M Aras expressed to Lord Cranborne his pleasure at the renewed assurance of the friendship of His Majesty’s Government for Turkey, and the French Foreign Minister expressed through His Majesty’s Embassy at Paris appreciation of tie attitude of the United Kingdom delegation. Part V .—Subsequent Developments. 38. The bilateral conversations were resumed at Paris shortly afterwards between M. Aras and M. Vienot, but soon broke down, a joint communique published on the 23rd December stating that as the exchange of views had not enabled the parties to reach agreement, they contemplated the possibility of continuing conversations through the diplomatic channel and in contact with the rapporteur before the next session of the Council. 39. From the information so far available it seems that the breakdown was inevitable since the Turks adhered rigidly to their demand for the complete independence of the sanjak, while the French failed to put forward any concrete proposals for a compromise, and merely talked vaguely of “ autonomy ” subject to allegiance to Syria. (The Turks themselves have stated that the desiderata which they put forward in Paris were :— (1) Complete independence for the sanjak. (2) Demilitarisation of the sanjak. (3) Lease to Turkey of an area in the port of Alexandretta and a railway agreement. (4) A new suggestion for the inclusion of Alexandretta in a federation with Syria and the Lebanon.) [14420] D12 40. The Turks were disappointed with the outcome of the Paris talks, and they became angry when the French Ambassador at Angora returned to his post early in January without any fresh instructions, although M. Blum had promised M. Aras in Paris to look into the matter personally. The tone of the Turkish press became distinctly menacing, there were rumours of concentrations of 1 urkish troops on the Syrian frontier, and excitement and anxiety were mui^ increased when the Turkish President suddenly left Angora for Southern Turkey and broke his journey at Eskishehr for a secret conference with his principal civil and military advisers. The French press took alarm, and persistent rumours circulated that the Turks were contemplating a coup de main in the sanjak. 41. Meanwhile, the position in the sanjak continued to be highly delicate. According to a report of the 16th December from His Majesty’s consul at Aleppo, the Turkish propaganda seemed to have taken some effect in the territory. Mr. Davis expressed the opinion that, while only a small part of the Turkish elements fervently desired union with Turkey, they would all prefer it to subordination to an Arab administration. The majority of the rest of the population seemed to favour autonomy, but, for economic reasons, might well opt for inclusion in 1 urkey rather than Syria. The three neutral observers (of Norwegian, Dutch and Swiss nationality), who had been appointed in accordance with the decision of the League Council on the 16th December (paragraph 31 above), arrived in the sanjak early in January. Their presence in the town of Alexandretta was the signal for a demonstration by Turkish elements, followed by a counter-demonstration by the Arab nationalists, which obliged the authorities to close the town to the outside world. 42. Meanwhile, occasion has been taken recently to make the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the dispute entirely clear to the Turkish Government, who, it seems, may not have been informed of the warning which M. Aras received from Lord Cranborne on the 14th December (paragraph 20 above), since on the 27th December His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora reported that they were apparently looking forward to British support for their thesis at the coming session of the Council. The Turkish Ambassador called on Sir R. Vansittart on the 1st January, and was given a detailed explanation of the views of His Majesty’s Government on the legal aspect of the question (on the lines of paragraphs 15-16 above), which compelled them to oppose the present Turkish demands. On the 7th January M. Fethi Okyar called on the Secretary of State and embarked on a further attempt to justify the Turkish case, chiefly on the basis that it was impossible for Turks to be subjected politically to Arabs. He said that he had been instructed to ask for Mr. Eden’s support. 43. The Secretary of State told the Ambassador in reply that he could only endorse the account of the attitude of His Majesty's Government which had been given to M. Aras at Geneva by Lord Cranborne and to M. Okyar himself at the Foreign Office on the 1st January. Turning to the immediate situation, Mr. Eden drew the Ambassador’s attention to the unfortunate rumours that were circulating in the press about I urkish troop concentrations on the Syrian frontier, and expressed the hope that they had not, in fact, taken place, since they could only fail to aggravate the situation with which the League would soon have to deal. Anglo-Turkish relations were exceptionally good and His Majesty’s Government felt that they could give the Turkish Government the frank advice to go slow and to be very careful not to take any action which might be misunder stood. or might aggravate the situation. This advice was entirely spontaneous; no communication had been received recently from the French Government. In response to a subsequent enquiry by the Ambassador, Mr. Eden said that the Turkish Government could he sure that His Majesty’s Government would do anything in their power to further a solution; they were very good friends with both Turkey and France, and—to put it no higher—it was in their interest to do so. 44. At the time of writing (the 11th January), the latest developments in the situation are more reassuring. Sir P. Loraine had a long and apparently satisfactory conversation with M. Aras on the 7th January, in which the latter admitted for the first time that the formal independence of the sanjak was not necessarily a sine qua non for Turkey. M. Aras also denied that any increase had taken place in Turkish units covering the Syrian frontier, or that any political significance attached to M. Ataturk’s journey. He added that Turkey intended to conduct her case in a strictly legal manner. Meanwhile, M. Vffinot -*■ *13 iind the 1 urkish Ambassador in Paris had a further exchange of views on the 8th January, as a result of which the alarm felt in France was sensibly reduced. 45. Finally, on the l()th January the Secretary-General of the League telegraphed to members of the Council that, at the desire of the French and lurkish Governments, the ra'pyorteur suggested the postponement of the meeting the Council until the 21st January. A telegram from Sir P. Loraine at Angora confirms that the parties are anxious to extend the time available for bilateral negotiations, while they are now both engaged on preparing proposals for a solution hy compromise.

In the first place I had better tell him frankly v/hat Fethi Okyar had in front of him if he was to attempt your conversion to Turkish point of view. Lord Cranborne had warned him on December 14th at Geneva of what was at that time your view. Since then you had yourself studied carefully the Turkish arguments and your views had crystallized in precisely the sense that Lord Cranborne had led him to expect. You had made this study and reached your conclusions in friendliest spirit, as always, towards Turkey and you had authorized me at my discretion to make them known to His Excellency at a suitable moment. Actually I should have preferred to wait until M.Blum's expected proposals had been received in Angora and had so informed you, but matter being presented to me as it was new, and Turkish Ambassador having been directed to approach you I thought it best to tell hi i at once with friendship, loyalty and candour where you stood. And I did so. I quoted to him Lord Cranborne's language as reported in Geneva telegram No. 168 paragraph 8 which he accepted as a true account. I quoted on the legal aspect the last two paragraphs of your telegram No. 143 to Geneva which he said he thought he could accept. I outlined political objections to an independent Banjak, omitting however any specific mention of Iraq because I know the Turks regard the liquidation of Mosul vilayet question as final and irrevocable. Lastly I said very categorically Turkish GcvafPfMent continued to press for independence of Sanjak you could not follow them.

If, as I understood, the French were quite willing (a) to discuss an even wider guarantee for the local regime and the Turkish minority than that now existing under the organic statute; (b) to ensure economic facilities at Alexandretta for Turkey; and (c) to devise measures for the neutralisation or non-militarisation of Alexandretta: and if (a) and (b) were supported by His Majesty's Government, I failed to see why an agreement could not be reached 'which gave Turkey satisfaction on all matters of substance.

THE Turkish Ambassador asked to see me this evening when he stated that a few days ago he had had an opportunity of speaking to Sir Robert Vansittart on the subject of the Alexandretta Sanjak when Mr. Rendel had also been present. The latter had explained certain weaknesses which he considered to exist in the Turkish case from the juridical point of view. The Turkish Government, how ever, did not wholly agree with this view and the Ambassador had therefore been instructed to come to see me to speak about the matter. As I would be aware, conversations had taken place in Paris between M. Aras and M. Delbos and M. Blum, when the last-named had undertaken to interest himself personally in the issue. When, therefore, the French Ambassador had returned to Angora the Turkish Government had been disappointed to find that he had no new suggestions to make. M. Aras had understood that the French Government appreciated that a system should be set up in Alexandretta which if not strictly independent of Damascus rule was at least largely so. Now that the Ambassador had returned without any further information the Turkish Government were anxious lest the French Government should have receded from that position and taken up a stiller attitude. What the Turks really could not endure was that a number of men and women of their race should be governed by Arabs from Damascus. They had lost the war and as a consequence the sanjak had been surrendered, but it had not been surrendered to Arab rule. In these conditions, the Ambassador had been instructed to come and ask for my help. The Ambassador mentioned that the Turkish Government had always been a faithful member of the League and were most anxious to act as such. 2. I replied that his Excellency’s visit was most opportune since I myself was anxious to speak to him about the situation that was developing between Turkey and France on this issue. He would be aware that Lord Cranborne had spoken to M. Aras at Geneva, and would recall what Sir Robert Vansittart and Mr. Rendel had said to the Ambassador himself in London. I had nothing to add to these statements, all of which I fully endorsed. My object this evening, how^- ever, was not to enter with him into the merits of the case, though I was prepared to do this at any time if his Excellency so desired, but rather to deal with the short period which must now intervene before the matter came before the Council at Geneva. 3. I then drew the Ambassador’s attention to the reports in the evening papers that Turkey was massing troops on her southern frontier. The Ambassador read the reports and stated that he had no information that could either confirm or deny them. I said that I much hoped that there was no truth in these reports because if it were true that a large number of troops had been sent to Turkey’s southern frontier the Ambassador would appreciate that such a move might aggravate the situation with which the Council would so soon have to deal. I proposed to speak to him frankly because the relations of our two countries were so exceptionally good that I felt that the frankness would be understood. The Ambassador immediately said that this was so. I then told his Excellency that our urgent and earnest advice to the Turkish Government, given as a friend of Turkey, was that they should go slow and be very careful not to take any action in the next few days which might be misunderstood or which might aggravate the situation. To show the Ambassador that our action was entirely spontaneous I added that in point of fact I had received no communication of any kind from the French Government recently, and, though M. Corbin had been to see me this afternoon, he had not even mentioned the subject. 4. M. Okyar replied that he would certainly report what I had said to his Government. He was afraid that the truth was that opinion on this subject was very strong in Turkey. Did I think that there was a good chance of Geneva [900 g—1]being able to produce a solution? I replied that at the present time I had insufficient material to enable me to form a judgment. We were as yet without detailed reports of what had passed in Paris.

As record by bag of January 7th will not reach you for some days following summary of interview may be useful to you. Turkish Ambassador on 1st January began by saying that Turkey haa only ceded Sanjak to France in 1921 on condition that it should remain autonomous. France was now violating this agreement by proposing to hand over Sanjak to Syria which would place 200,000 Turks under Arab rule. Turks could never accept this. It was explained to His Excellency that, while question was one for league to settle, it was desirable to make it clear at once that His Majesty's Government could not accept above argument. Situation was governed by Article 16 of Treaty of Lausanne, and Article 7 of Franklin-Bouillon Treaty - which in any case provided not for autonomy but only for a special administrative regime - applied only insofar' as it was confirmed by Lausanne. Turkey on entering League of Nations had accepted Mandate system including Syrian Mandate and also Article 22 of League Covenant, which specifi cally provides for the eventual emancipation of ex-Ottoman territories undex A' mandates. Turkey therefore had long known what would eventually happen in Syria, while provision of Article 7 of 1921 Treaty, as confirmed by Lausanne, had already been met by provision in Franco-byrian Treaty for continuance of special administrative regime. For this and other reasons Turkey therefore seemed to have noA2 . no /=Kise for pressing for political, separation of Sanjak from Syria. Y/hen Ambassador feverted to objections to Turks being placed under Arab rule it was pointed out that there were many other minorities in Syria, just as there was a Turkish minority in northern Iraq; that the Franco-Syrian Treaty safeguarded the position of the Turkish minority; but that the eventual emancipa tion of Syria would in any case be conditional on her acceptance of whatever special safeguards might be thought necessary by the League, v/hen Turkey could press her case. Finally it was suggested that compromise might still be found provided Turkish G-overnment abandoned their extreme claims.

Your telegram No. 7 [of January 6th: Alexandretta]. Turkish Ambassador called on me on January 7th and referred to his interview of January 1st v.ith Sir R. Vansittart and lx* Rendei (see my telegram No. 7 [of January 7th]). He explained that Turkish Government did not wholly agree with juridical arguments which had then been advanced, and had therefore instructed him to raise matter again. He then briefly summarised what had passed in Paris (see your telegrams Nos. 4 [of January 5th] and 6 [of January 6th]). Turkish Government were apprehensive lest French Government were now receding from this position and taking up stiffen attitude. Turks could not agree to men and women of Turkish race being governed from Damascus, and, though they had lost Ssnjak as a result of the war, they had not surrendered it to Arab rule. Ambassador had therefore been instructed to ask for my help. He added that Turkey had always been faithful member of League and was most anxious to act as such. I replied that His Excellency’s visit was most opportune since I was anxious to speak to him about situation that was developing between Turkey and France on this issue. I fully endorsed, and had nothing to add to, statements made to Monsieur Aras by Lord Cranborne at Geneva (see Geneva telegram No. 168 [of December 14th] and to Ambassador himself by Sir R. Vansittart and Mr. Rendei on January 1st). My object now however w T as not to enter into merits of case, though I was prepared to do this at any time if he so desired, but to deal with shortsh/1 * period intervening, before matter came before Council at Geneva. I then drew his attention to reports in evening papers here that turkey was massing troops on her southern frontier. He had no informa tion to confirm or contradict these. I much hoped that there was no truth in them, because if large number of troops had been sent to frontier he would appreciate that this might aggravate situation with which League Council would so soon have to deal, r proposed to speak frankly because Anglo-rurkish relations were so exceptionally good that I felt frankness would he understood. Our urgenu and earnest advice to the Turkish Government given as a friend ox Turkey was that they should go slow and be very careful not to take any action in the next few days which might he misunderstood or which might aggravate the situation. This advice was entirely spontaneous since I had received no recent communication from French Government on the subject. The Ambassador promised to report what I had said hut feared that opinion in Turkey was strong. Did I think Geneva was likely ao produce a solution? I re plied that I had not yet sufficient material or information as to what had passed in Paris to form a judgment, hut in reply to his enquiry whether Turkish Government could count on our good offices I said he could be sure that we would do anything we could to bring about solution of difficulty since we were very good friends with both Turkey and France so that to put it no higher it was clearly in our interest to further a solution, council had appointed an excellent rannorteur in Mr. Sandler, and i xelt sure .e could count on Turkish Government's own collaboration. You should be guided by above and by instructions in my tele|ram No. 2 [of January 4th] in any further conversations, but I a^ree tna you need not take initiative in raising matter for the present.

Copy No. 131 Acting Consul Davis to Mr.'Eden.—(Received December 18.) (No. 65. Confidential.) Sir, Aleppo, December 12, 1936. I HAVE the honour to report that on the 30th November last, on the occasion of the secondary elections in the Sandjak of Alexandretta, serious disturbances took place at Antioch. It is reported that some pro-Turkish elements had made plans for a widespread rising on this occasion, but a hot headed assault by young demonstrators on the houses of three newly-elected Moslem Deputies in Antioch precipitated a climax before the leaders were ready. The civil authorities there immediately called in the troops. Order was quickly re-established after three persons had been killed and seventeen seriously wounded. 2. For some days after the incident Antioch and its district was patrolled by cavalry, tanks and armoured cars were stationed in the principal centres, and machine-guns were posted in the bazaars. From 7 o'clock in the evening onwards no movement was allowed in the streets. 3. There is a great deal of discussion and surmise locally regarding the future of the sandjak. Many Syrian Nationalists profess to believe that the question has already been settled between France and Turkey and that the reference to the League of Nations is a mere formality designed to render the bitter pill of dismemberment less unpalatable. They have accordingly sent some of their best men to Geneva to watch the proceedings of the League in the interests of the Syrian Republic. Dr. Abdul Rahman-el-Kayali, newly-elected Deputy for Aleppo, left this town yesterday for Tripoli to fly to Europe by the x\ir France. He is accompanied by Hassan Jbara, Director of Finance at Alexandretta, a prominent member of the Alaouite community, and they are to be joined by Ihsan-el-Jabri and the Emir Shakib Arslan, two of the principal advisers of the Syrian delegation during the recent treaty negotiations in Paris. 4. Turkish consular representatives in this area have shown great interest in the recent events at Antioch. My Turkish colleague here, Haki Bey, left on the 9th December for Antioch, where he met Faridoun Bey, the Turkish consul- general at Beirut. They returned together to Aleppo in the evening of the 11th. It is reported that Earidoun Bey is going on to Angora to report. 5. Certain Turkish papers have been banned in Antioch and Alexandretta to avoid inflaming local feeling, which is already sufficiently intense. They have, in fact, been publishing sensational accounts of the atrocities inflicted on the Turkish inhabitants of the sandjak. 6. From a conversation I had yesterday with General Noiret, Officer Commanding Troops in Northern Syria, it would appear that the military authorities are on the alert on the Turco-Syrian frontier and that the troops have been reinforced. He stated to me that his chief anxiety was that any decision to be taken should be taken quickly. He did not anticipate any “ ungentlemanly ' action on the part of the Turkish Government itself, but he did entertain apprehensions lest ignorant Turkish subordinates in charge of frontier garrisons should through excess of zeal involve themselves in awkward incidents, or unauthorised firebrands on the Turkish side should seize the opportunity to display their patriotism and at the same time collect a little loot by an excursion into Syrian territory. He added that any such unwelcome visitors would find everything very nicely pre pared for their reception. I have, &amp;c. A. W. DAVIS. [881 s—1]—Decypher. Sir P Do 1.15 p.m. 27th December, 1956.

Your telegrams Nos. 159 [of December 21st] from Constantinople end 194 [of December 27th] from Angora, paragraph 2 [Alesandretta]. If Turkish Government continue to press for independence of Sanjak, it will be impossible, as Lord Cranbome told Monsieur Aras on December 14th (see Geneva telegram N o. 168, paragraph 8), for his Majesty's Government to support them. Moreover, the French Government, so far from having been prevented by His Majesty's Government from falling in with Turkish view, have, as you know. taken initiative in asking His Majesty’s Government for support, and urged obvious common interest of both Governments in preventing a development which could only cause serious reactions in Arab world. 2. I am no less anxious than you to maintain and develop the present cordiality of Anglo-Turkish relations, to which you have contributed so largely and have given careful study to arguments on which Turks base their case. But I can only regard case itself as f un d amen t&amp;lly unsound both legally (see last two paragraphs of my //0/7 telegram No. 143 Jp Geneva [of December 17th]) and politically. S. As exnlained. in paragraph 2 of my telegram No. 141 [of December 12th] to Geneva, his Majesty's Government would be willing to su'ooort any measures designed to guarantee rights and liberties of Turkish population provided Sanjak is not detached from State of Syria, and would consider giving their support to any reasonable proposals for the grant of special economic facilities for Turkey at Alexandretta. But political implications of Turkish proposal raise is^ue^. If attempt is made to transform Sanjak into what must2* be a firadamentally artificial and unnatural independent unit ? it will be obliged by force of circumstances to gravitate towards one or c.r - of its r-re pov/erful neighbours and will thus constitute standing source of friction between them. Turks may have no present indention of absorbing it, but its ultimate incorporation in Turkey might be difficult to avoid, particularly if free field were given for Turkish propaganda. In view of potential importance of Alexandretta as naval base, and of possibilities of direct railway communicarion with Transcaucasia, this would cause disturbanc of statu s cup in hastern mediterranean leading to serious conse quences elsewhere. 4. moreover expansion of Turkish influence beyond present frontiers of ljik-y as established by Treaty of Lausanne might have r\ ■&lt;- r i ' Tn Q -c. OU/j, JmJ U O i.V UJ ..O .y p- hi g effect in Iraq, which also contains important Turkish or Turcci.' n elements in Northern liwas. Adverse reaction would not be confined to Syria, but would cause political anxiety throughout Arabia and Middle East. Definite impression was created by Turkish Delegation at Geneva that Turkish move was prelude to forward policy in Arab countries. 5. I realise that Turkish public opinion is at present excited, but there seems no doubt that Turkish President can effectively control it. Anglo-Turkish friendship now rests on such solid founda tions that it could surely survive some plain speaking - as indeed it did in the case of monsieur Aras* proposals of October 1st for .. sroo Puss inn understanding over Dardanelles - and I feel that, as roc friends of Turkey, it is only right that we should try to rTSsuade her from her present policy in this cuestion. 6.

I was not aware until I received this that negotiations were taking place for the re-arrangement of the Territories that were placed under French Mandate. I hope you will find the memorandum useful. You may not know that Dr. Christie has spent nearly his whole life in Palestine and Syria, and has an unequalled knowledge of these countries both historically and ethnologically and speaks all the languages of the East fluently. Yours &amp;c., (Signed) J. Leckie. The Right Hon. Anthony Eden, M.P. , Foreign Secretary, Foreign Office, WHITEHALL, S.W.l.THE TURKISH SPEAKING DIGTRICT IN NORvH WE&amp;T SYRIA. The Public Press has just indicated the probable formation of the district around Alexandretta and Antioch into a separate Turkish speaking province of Syria in the rearrangement of the territories that were placed under French Mandate. It is quite probable that questions, that we understand are about to rise from the part of the Turks, may be settled as between France and Turkey without any inter vention from Britain, but in case cf our Government authorities requiring special information, I think fit to make a short statement on the evidence on which the present boundary line was formed, and to explain the share I had in indicating that boundary line. un October 4th 1917 I was summoned to London from Glasgow for the purpose cf giving information regarding the boundaries cf the Turkish and Arabic Languages, and was told there that an arrangement had been made by which no peace would be made with the Turks till the whole cf Arabic-speaking territory was in possession of the allies. About 2C years earlier I had had a dispute with the British and Foreign Bible Society concerning the accuracy of a Language Map that they had issued. As I had travelled much in connection with Armenian questions (Surrender of Zeitum, Investigation of supposed conversion «f Armenians to Islam at Biredjik, and administration «f Relief Funds) my knowledge of the district was unquestionable. I was examined by Dr. Lionel King of the British Museum, and Dr. Dickie, who had done some excavating work in PalestinePalestine, and both of them I had previously met in the East, I laid dov/n the boundary from Karkemish (Jerabulus or Jerabis) on the Auphrates to Antioch, which I described as ’’half Arabic and half Turkish” e At this stage we had to enter *n the most exact detail, I described the boundary of the Turkish language as passing southwest and running out at a headland south of Mount Cassius anc. the town of Kassab, with Suadea on the Orontes as an Arabic island in a Turkish sea. I stated that all the villages and small towns in the district were Turkish speaking. The question was put to me regarding Alexandretta as the ”natural port of Aleppo” and I was told that for this reason the French wanted it. I admitted all this and went further, stating that for strategic reasons the line of separation ought to be north of Alexandretta, probably by the route Alexander took over the mountains. This route I was unable to outline but I was asked to explain the route over the Beilan Pass, taken by Xenophon, and that of the Crusaders, up the Crontes from Seleucia (Suadea) to Antioch. We then returned to the Language-question. I maintained that the chief language of Alexandretta was Turkish, but stated that a good deal of Greek was spoken, chiefly by Levantines, and that Arabic had also a place, being spoken mainly by people coming and going in connection with trade, and who to some extent had members of their families resident for some time in Alexandretta. T mentioned that there was amission of the Reformed Presbyterian Church from Ireland doing their work in Arabic, and that in April, 1904, I had there preached to them in Arabic in the forenoon, while in the afternoon I interpreted from German to Arabic for Paster Brunnemann of Liar a sh, who understood Turkish but for this( '*my***4 4 ' ■•* • t? r'**. this congregation had to he interpreted into Arabic. There was, as can be understood, a community that required their religious teaching in Arabic, their own language, though they might in a ‘'broken Turkish'' engage in trading. This mission still exists under the leadership of Dr. Kennedy. This evidence was considered most satisfactory as there was then no ground for bias in favour of either party in 190^, and ihe fact could be independently sub stantiated by some one’s 'poking fun at the Scot, who translated from German to Arabic' in the Church Magazine of the said Church. Alexandretta and the whole surrounding land was then assigned to Syria. In the course of con versation I remarked, 'but the same conditions held round the coast to Mersine, and there I addressed on a Wednesday night a congregation of (I think) 90 persons in Arabic'. Later on I was sorry to learn that Cilicia had accordingly been assigned to Syria, which, had I known beforehand, I should have deprecated as breaking into Aisa Minor, and leaving no strategic boundary between it and Syria. The ethnological question was not considered by us, but there is much to be said concerning that. I cannot produce statistics, but from my own travelling- through the district I think my testimony ought to be that the Turkish speaking element is to a very large extent Armenian in race and Turkish in Language, and in case of any dispute there would be from a plebiscite a definite Armenian (Turkish-speaking Christian) majority revealed. In 1896 we spent the summer at Beilan. There was a Turkish-Armenian Pr#testant Church, which must still exist, and which I addressed. A massacre was threatened, and as we could not move out, though warned to do so, I walked to Alexandretta on the Sunday morning to the Consulate, got into touch with the Commander Scott (later Sir Percy Scott) whowho by his quiet discretion prevented the massacre taking placeo On the Tuesday fixed for the massacre, that planned in Constantinople actually came off. % V/e spent other summers in SOUQ-OLUQ on the hills to the south of Beilan, and at Kessab, on the southern slope of Mount Cassius, and in these the whole population was Armenian Christian but Turkish speaking. Then in IKICOlUQ on the hills to the west of Kessab, I married a peasant couple of Armenian Protestants in Turkish. I mention this as it may be said that the Armenians are city-dwellers, while the peasantry are Moslem Turks. The people of that- village w«re, I believe Armenian Protestant Christians, connected with the American Missionary Board (Congregational) with Headquarters at Aintab and Marash, still in Turkish territory. These conditions are such as were existent before the war broke out, but I believe, from my knowledge of the peoples, that investigation would show that the generation that has arisen since 1914, even though under standing Turkish when spoken, now use Arabic among them selves and in all natters of business. I have spoken only concerning Armenian Protestants, but there are also Armenian Catholic Churches, and mixed with the other items of population a goodly number of Arabic speaking Syrian Christians are to be met. These are Jacobites, Nestorians (sometimes unfortunately called Assyrians) Chaldean Catholics, and others, all Arabic in language whatever they may be ethnolcgically. (Signed) W.K. CHRISTIE, D.D.

Following from Lord Cranborne: My telegram No. 169. Council this morning resumed consideration of the question of Alexandretta. French representative made a long speech of which following is a summary: He stated that the French Government could not accept the Turkish thesis since they regarded Article 29 of Covenant and decision of Supreme Council allotting mandate in 1920 as defining juridical position of France in all ex-Ottoman territory which had passed under their control. They had acquired no sovereignty but merely mission to develop territories in accordance with mandatory principles. It was necessarily left to France after 1920 to organise administration and to conclude agreements fixing frontiers, one of which was Franco- Turkish Agreement of 1921, confirmed at Lausanne in 1925. M. Vienot replied to Turkish argument about Cilicia (see para graph 4 of my telegram under reference) by asserting that military occupation after the war was a question of fact which could not be nela to fix a legal frontier. Such a legal frontier first came into existence in 1921. As regards Article 7 of 1921 Treaty, he interpreted -its guarantees in savour of Turks as proving intention to embody Sanjak in a wider non-Turkish state. m. Vienot summed up attitude of French Government on juridical aspect2 . aspect as follows:-* In 1921 France had. negotiated, and could only negotiate, with Turkey in the capacity of mandatory for Syria; France had never received any direct sovereignty over the Sanjak and could not have assumed it through a frontier delimitation agreement; the Sanjak had no special juridical claim to independence outside Syria, Turning to more recent history of Sanjak, M. Vienot said that the Turkish Government had raised no objection to treatment given to Turkish elements there throughout last 15 years, nor to the collabora tion of the Sanjak and its elected deputies in national life of Syria, In 1950 Council had approved Organic Law of Syria and special autonomous statute of Sanjak embodied therein. Turning to the future, M. Vienot pointed out that, pending entry into force of Franco-Syrian Treaty, Turkey would have full opportunity to make objections and propose amendments in course of detailed con sideration v/hich would be given to Treaty by the various organs of the League. In any case, Treaty settlement as drafted could not affect existing rights of Turks in the Sanjak since new r Syrian State was contracting vis-a-vis France to respect existing international obliga tions. For this reason it had not been necessary to make specific mention of Sanjak in the draft Treaty. Furthermore, population of Sanjak would benefit by general minority guarantees as embodied in exchange of notes between French and Syrians included in treaty settle ment wnich gave French Government right to intervene, if necessary, in support of these guarantees. ivi. Vienot maintained that France had taken ail necessary precautions 'vis-a-vis Syrians to safeguard existing rights of population of Sanjak. nevertueless, as token of their friendship towards Turkish Government, trench Government had been ready to offer further guarantees through auditionax Franco-Syrian exchange of letters. But Turkish Government6, demanded erection of Sanjak into independent State, proposal which wa. mac cep table to French Government as going far beyond 1921 Ixeaiy and coming in direct conflict with mandatory document of 1922, vrincn referred only to states of Syria and the Lebanon. France had no sovereignty over the Sanjak, and could not possibly negotiate an agreement which would conflict with the terms of the Mandate and with the principles laid down from time to time by the League. He recalled decision of Mandates Commission at 24th session (approved by Council m January 1924), which specifically excluded, as incompatible tn&lt;3 ' andate ’ an y idea of erecting a third independent territorial unit within the mandated territories, M. Vienot observed that the Council was capable of changing the present juridical position. French Government felt obliged, however, o dxaw attention to grave practical risks which any such modification would entail in the present case. Unity of Syrian territory was fundamental principle of Franco-Syrian settlement and amputation of jak at this stage would cause consternation among whole Arab world which might easily lead to further grave troubles in the Near Last. ’ k. Vienot then expressed surprise at 1L Aras' allegations about present condition of Turkish population in the Sanjak. Small military reinforcements had been sent there solely in view of provocative incidents and also to supervise the frontier. As justi fication M. Vienot referred to speech by Turkish Prime Minister on 15th December, containing allusion to risk of very embarrassing situation suddenly developing over the Sanjak.

Council this morning concluded its consideration of question of Alexandretta. Tne Rapporteur read his report to the Council. Parties were, he said, agreed in asking the Council to postpone an examination of the substance of the question until its next ordinary session. x.s regards conservatory measures, the French representative Lad been unaole to accept the proposed despatch to the Sanjak of neutral gendarmerie under a Leame Commissioner but was prepared to modify the proposals made in his speech on the 15th December so as to pro vide for the despatch of observers to the Sanjak alone (and not to the Turkish side of the frontier as well). The French Government ;/e re further ready to postpone their own ratification of the Treaty pending a decision by the Council on the substance of the question, and also to withdraw the military reinforcements recently sent to the territory as soon as the observers had arrived. The Turkish representative had been unable to acceot the Frerei proposals but had stated that there was no question of any military steps being taken on the Turkish side of the frontier. It*s m ce... o It was thus ini )o- sible to reach agreement regarding conservator measures. In view, however, oi the French Government’s express request, he suggested that the Council should send as soon as possiole to the hanjak a mission oi‘ t iree observers, whose role would be defined as follows:- 'It should be understoo •. that according to the French proposal, the task of these observers would be neither to study the substance oi the question nor to enquire into the events which may have occurred recently in the district of Alexandretta and Antioch. Nor will the observers have to take any action themselves with a view to the maintenance of order or the pacification of the state of mind oi the population. Their duty will simply be to observe and to keep in touch with the facts in order to be able to inform the Council if necessary'. The Rapporteur then proposed a draft resolution, the text of which is contained in my telegram No. 171. The Turkish Representative said that Turkey had decided to abstain from voting on the resolution. She would not hinder its adoption by voting against it. Turkish Government would continue to seek an amicable solution. Monsieur Aras then re-stated the suggestions of his Government as regards conservatory measures as being the complete neutralisa-- tion oi the contested zone, with a view to a searching enquiry kh recent events and the prevention of further repressive measures, these proposals had been agreed to, the Turkish Government wou.iu. have been ready to submit to a similar enquiry upon its own terri tory. On the other hand, the Turkish Government considered that the simple mission of observers proposed by the French Government would not be able to form a correct picture of the position in the Sanjak.since it could only obtain infornation of prejudiced local authoritieSc Turkish Government would, nevertheless, have been ready to accept such a mission provided that its neutral element had been supplemented by both french and Turkish members. The unwillingness of the French Representative to agree to this obliged Turkey to consider all the French proposals as insufficientr The French Repres e ntativ e, having explained once more 'why France could not accept neutral administration in the Sanjak, observed that the French request for a mission of neutral observers was unprecedented concession by a mandatory power. Monsieur Vienot repudiated the Turkish accusations regarding internal conditions of the Sanjak but hoped that the arrival of the observers would bring an atmosphere of calm. Finally, he laid stress on the fact that the conciliatory measures proposed by the Rapporteur emanated entirely irom French Government, which was still prepared to put into operation the concession regarding ratification of the Treaty and withdrawal of reinforcements despite the negative attitude of the Turkish Government. The Roumaiian reoresentative expressed the regret of his Government at the existence of a difference between two such cherished friends as France and Turkey and its hopes for an early settlement. I then spoke in the sense summarised in my immediately following Saving telegram. The Rapporteur concluded the debate by expressing his regret at * • • » 64. at failure to obtain agreement between the parties, and the hope that in the conversation which would shortly open between them they would spare no effort to find a solution. The Council would in adopting his report, be taking note of the assurances which the two parties had given of their desire to reach an amicable settlement.

Following from Lora Crcinborne. % immeaiately preceding telegrai;.u I begcin my speech to the Council coday by pointing our that, apart from their position on the Council, His Majesty’s Goveriiment in tne United kingdom had special reasons for taking a close interest in the question. They were themselves a Mandatory Pov/er, they were most anxious that nothing should occur to disturb the political tranquillity of the hear hast, ana they had close ana coraial friendship for both govern ments concerned. His majesty's Government were disappointed that it had not been possible to reach agreement on conservatory measures, but they were convinced, in view of very conciliatory spirit displayed, that it ..ould soon be possible to reach an amicable solution of the whole question. Meanwhile, His majesty's Government were p for the resolution, but considered it necessary repared to vote to make certain observations on the proposal to send an international mission of observers to the Sanjak, in view of the very special interest of chis proposed to the United Kingdom in its capacity of the only other Power besides France still charged with an ''a 1 ' Mandate. I then continued in the following terms '*1 think23$j 2 * ■'I think that, in orn.er co -void any possible misunder standing in the future, I shouiu recall *chat ic is a funda mental principle of the mmdabory system that the mandatory Pouer is responsible for the Maintenance of order in mandated territory.

In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government are prepared to agree to the proposal in question. Further, we t ,re here dealing with a case the circumstances of which are in a special category, since it arises out of a difference of opinion in the interpretation of a Treaty between the Mandatory Power ana another state.

December 14th 1953. December 15th 1956. D. 9.45 a.m. No.16b. R. 11. 5 a. m. Following from Lord Cranborne:- j I had a talk this morning with the Tarnish Minister for Foreign Affairs on question of Ale^sndretta. I found his at.oi cuae less satisfactory than indications from French side had led me to hone. 2. He indicated that there were two aspects of the problem which had to be dealt with - fundamental problem which he agreed must be left until the January Council and temporary measures for the maintenance of law and order and the prevention of trouble which it would be necessary to deal with now. Ee had had an interview with Monsieur Vienot at which he had discussed both these aspects. 5. So far as temporary measures were concerned he had reached agreement with him on all but one point. Monsieur Vienot he said had agreed that there should be a small international commission on both sides of Turko-Syrian frontier to avoid any possibility of incidents. Monsieur Vienot had also agreed to the setting up of an international committee of enquiry to examine recent incidents in the Sandjak and to be ready to deal with any future ones. 4. There Y/as one point alone on which they had failed to reach agreement. Turkish Minister for Foreign affairs had asked that a very small international force should be sent to the Candjak untiluntil such time as fundamental issues had been settled. Monsieur Vienot had been unable to agree to this. Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs had indicated that alternative v/as that both sides should keep themselves free to send what troops they wished to the frontier in case of trouble. He said rather cynically that this situation would be far more embarrassing to France than to Turkey. It would cost Turkey little to send three army corps to the frontier. Indeed he said with a grin as a result of manoeuvres they happened already to be close to it. For France to send three army corps would be exceedingly expensive and might upset the equilibrium in Western Liurope. He hoped therefore that the French Government would see their way to accept this alternative Otherwise if there were any incidents within the S&amp;ndjak 'Turkey must reserve the right to take what he called immediate defensive measures by which he appeared to mean a concentration of troops on the frontier. He insisted that Turkey must be in a position to show the rurkish population in the Sandjak that she was able and willing to see that they received the treatment which the Franco-Turkish agreement accorded them. 5. I said that it seemed to me that the question of an international force raised great difficulties. 6. Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs then proceeded to a disquisition on the fundamental issue. He said that Turkey had never admitted the existence of a mandate over Syria. Avery arrangement touching Syria into which Turkey had entered had been a bilateral one between herself and France. According to Monsieur Aras neither in the treaty of 1921 nor in that of 1926 had Turkey aomitted the existence of a French mandate. 7. He went on to argue that S^ria had been handed over to France as a whole and Turkey would be quite ready even now to agree to the setting uo of a single independent State to comprise all Levant5. Levant territories under French control i.e. including Lebanon. ^They would accept them a? one of entity. Council however in 1922 had set up two separate tates of Lebanon and iyria. In doing this and in merging Sandjak with .Syria Council had gone beyond its powers and by giving Lebanon equal status with Syria had acted unjustly as regards Sandjak which by virtue of Franco-syrian treaty of .1921 was clearly in possession of special privileges. Turkey had been ready to accept this situation so long as administration of Syria was under the supervision of the Council. In future however the Council and Turkey as a member of the Council would have no established right to intervene with affairs of those areas covered by Franco-Syrian treaties. In the circumstances Turkey felt strongly that Sa be given independent status ndjak which had 'Turkish majority should and should not become accessory of what he asserted would now under the new treaty be in fact French protectorate after model of Morocco. Lausanne and Syria treaties might look the same but in fact they were very different. For the moment however he was willing to out this (question of ultimate allegiance aside and concentrate on the question of guarantee for the Turkish population of Sandjak. He was hopeful of reaching some solution of this urgently in direct conversations with French between now and January meeting of the Council. If subsequently question of allegiance could not be settled with French Government it would be a matter for the Council to decide. In any case Turkey would require complete demilitarisation of the Sandjak. On this point he understood French Government were in agreement with him. b. In reply to Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs I told him I did not wish to discuss fundamental issue which was a question to be left over to January Council. I thought it however right to warn him that present view of His Majesty's Government wasthat they would he obliged to oppose any separation of the SandjaK from S^ria. 1 thought it better to tell him this frankly at once as we were most desirous of not being placed in the position of having to oppose furbish public at the Council. I also said that though we were not directly interested in this question we had of course direct interest in seeing that nothing was done which might provoke trouble in Near _-ast. 9. furkish minister for Foreign nffairs said that he fully recognised this. He added that he hoped that we should give both sides the benefit of our benevolent advice, darkish Minister for Foreign affairs' general attitude throughout the conversation was friendly if cantankerous. addressed to Foreign Office no. 168 December 14-th, repeated to angora and Paris.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required fog official use.] — . f — yu &lt; 1 (E.7802/688/89.)

Commentators in this morning's newspapers are optimistic that an amicable solution will be reached and it is also reported that a settlement may be followed at a later date by the conclusion of a Franco-Turkish pact of friendship and mutual assistance. Stanislas de la Rochefoucauld, in this morning's ’’Petit Journal’’ (ifentre), states that the French Government will propose the setting up of a special League committee to enquire into the recent distur bances at Alexandretta, will be prepared to withdraw the troops subsequently sent there, and will agree not to ratify the Franco- Syrian Treaty before the January session of the Council. Wladimir d'Ormesson in the ’’Figaro” (Right) puts forward the view that the real problem of Alexandre tta is the Turkish fear of the encouragement which might be-given to the pan-Arab movement as the result of the domination ox the Turkish element in txe banjak by the Arab element.

Council this afternoon began consideration of question of Alexandretta. Turkish representative said that origins and nature of the dispute would be evident from documents circulated to Council. Urgent matter at present was condition of Turkish population in the Sanjak and Council should concentrate on this aspect before tackling the substance. Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he would put before the Council in due course detailed arguments on the substance. Meanwhile he would give brief justification of Turkish case and in particular define position of the League itself since French Government were arguing that the League was principal party concerned. Monsieur Aras then developed argument that the Sanjak could not be held to be included within the scope of the mandate for Syria, that it had been handed over by Turkey directly to France in 1921 on specific conditions and that it was now entitled to its freedom since France was proposing to withdraw. If mandate over n Syria n allocated by Supreme Council to France in 1920 had been intended to cover territories inhabited by Turks as well as by Lebanese and Arabs it would inevitably have applied also to large area of Turkish territory in Cilicia, then also under French occupation. Fact that mandate was never intended to have this application\ 2 ^loolication v/as however shown by fact that French were able in October 1F21 as a result of bilateral negotiation to surrender all territory in their occupation inhabited by Turks sxceot the Sanjak which they retained on specific conditions. He stated that conditional nature of cession of the Sanjak to the French had been confirmed by proceedings at Lausanne in 1923 after promulgation of mandatory document in 1922. Turkish delegation at Lausanne had refused first draft of Article 16 of Lausanne Treaty and insisted on present wording of second para graph of that Article which qualified renunciation of Turkish rights over the former territories. Moreover there was no mention of the Sanjak in the mandatory document which laid down that Arabic and French should be official languages in mandated territory w'hereas in 1921 this position was reserved to Turkish within the Sanjakc Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs denied that Turkish initiative was designed to dismember mandated territory and create new state which could not stand by itself and added that such dismemberment had actually been effected by League Council and Mandate Commission in separating Lebanon from Syria with all the resultant administrative difficulties. Turkish Government were anxious to prevent the League committing similar errors in future. In any event Turkish element in the Sanjak would always be of interest to Turkey. Meanwhile the position was that Turkish population in the Sanjak had just been victims of bloody repression for asserting their point of view. He denied that calm had been re-established in tne Sanjak since the territory was being kept down by force. In order to put an end to this dangerous situation and to create favourable atmosphere for examination of substance of the question Turkish3. 2SS Turkish Government proposed that the League should take the destiny of the Sanjak into its hands. As a first measure they suggested withdrawal of the French troops and of native troops hostile to Turkey from the Sanjak and its occupation by international force under a League Commissioner. Secondly they considered it necessary that neither France nor Syria should take any action calculated to change the position in the territory. Thirdly it was essential to re establish the atmosphere in the territory which would permit of satisfactory settlement of the main question. Monsieur Aras concluded by invoking Franco-Turkish friend ship which he asserted apart from the present question had never been stronger than at present. French representative expressed the hope that the matter would be discussed between the two parties in friendly manner which should not hov.evor be allowed to obscure the rights of Syria in the matter. French representative would have to defer until tomorrow a detailed reoly to Monsieur Aras' remarks. Mean while it was essential that a rapporteur should be appointed at once so as to get in touch with the parties without delay. On proposal of the President the Swedish Foreign Minister was then invited to serve as rapporteur. Monsieur Sandler accepted and undertook to submit to the Council as soon as possible proposals to meet the immediate situation. The Council will meet again tomorrow.

There exists between Turkey and France a dispute concerning the future of the territories of Alexandretta Antioch and dependencies conditionally ceded by 'Turkey in virtue of the treaties of 1921 and 1925. In conformity with article 11 I request the Council to decide to include the following points in the agenda of its forthcoming extraordinary session which is to open on December 10th: firstly the adoption of interim measures of protection to ensure the safety of the Turkish people of the Sanjak whose lives and liberties are endangered. These measures are of extreme urgency. Secondly the substantive question at issue between Turkey and France as to the future of the aforesaid territories. I should be grateful if the President of the Council would be good enough to arrange for the discussions on these two points to be opened on December 14th. I am leaving Ankara for Geneva tomorrow to take part in person in the Council's deliberations. Tevfik Rustu liras.

Most confidential. / 8948 1935 Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs tells me (1) that according to Turkish information forces of various sorts under the French command are over 50,000 and that a large proportion of these are concentrated in the vicinity of Turkey's South- West frontier; that the Turkish Government unwilling to suspect France and trusting that action will be decided on hy the Council on the lines indicated in my telegram under reference, will not complicate the situation by a counter-concentration or even hy reinforcing effectives of the three Turkish army corps covering southern frontier which at the moment are little more than skeleton formations. If events show however that Turkish confidence is misplaced, a similar disposition clearly cannot he counted on. (2) That although French Ambassador's comprehension of Turkish Governments attitude had satisfactorily broadened there was still a suspicion lurking in French mind and fostered hy Italians that Turkey had been incited to raise Alexandretta issue hy United Kingdom. His Excellency believed that French Ambassador himself realised this was absurd. (5) That Italians have been actively endeavouring to embroil the situation both between Turkey and France and France and mandated territories through Italian agents in the Sandjak j and *2 . and through the Catholic clergy in Lebanon. His Excellency surmises that the motive for this is what he calls 'usual' It a li a n dislike of any settlement being reached without Italian participation and a price paid to Italy for her adhesion. I told Hio Excellency that according to my own diagnosis the French were still unable to believe the formal Turkish assurances to the contrary notwithstanding, that Turkey's object was not to absorb the bandjak territorially; and that they regarded present Turkish attitude as manoeuvring for position which would enable them to incorporate bandjak in Turkish republic at some future convenient moment, e.g., at termination of mandate three years after entry into force of projected treaties or at expiration of those treaties themselves. I thought that if French could be definitely disabused of this idea - and His Excellency's own language to myself had quite convinced me of its erroneous character - the whole situation might be much more easy to handle than it now appeared. Minister for Foreign Affairs said he thought that very likely I was perfectly right. Information in the two telegrams is of course for exclusive information of His Majesty's Government.'

Action of Turkish Government seems most unfortunate, and I question whether safeguarding of rights of Turkish inhabitants can be taken as their sole objective. 2. While Mandate continues the French Government remain responsible to the Council of the League for the safety and welfare of all sections of the population. The Mandate can only terminate with the consent oi the Council who must decide on what conditions to give it. In the case of Iraq, the Council required promulgation by Iraq of a Declaration of Guarantees covering the rights of minorities etc., and will no doubt be guided by experience in Iraq in deciding on the conditions to be imposed in present case. 3. Turkish attempt to rush through a particular proposal and to bring the matter before the Council under Article 11 of the Covenant, seems therefore premature and likely to raise suspicion as to Turkey’s real object. Sanjak cannot stand alone, and if established as an independent unit, would be tempting field for irredentist ambitions and bone of contention between Turks and Arabs. The reactions in Syria and the Arab world to any attempt to amputate it from its hinterland would be serious. Not only might whole Franco-Syrian Treaty settlement be wrecked, but the Arabs might.....2 . might seek a new outlet to the sea at the expense of the Lebanon, resulting perhaps in a general agitation for the revision 01 the stat us ^uo throughout the Middle East. Un the other hand certain Powers would rightly or wrongly fear ultimate absorption oi Sanjak into Turkey, thus placing at the disposal of Turkey and possibly of Russia an important potential naval base, easily linked by direct railway to Transcaucasia. 4. Do you adhere to view that Turkey has no intention of absorbing Sanjak? And do you consider that Turkish Government appreciate (a) that the question of safeguards for Turkish inhabitants is one which the Council would normally have had to examine, independently of any Turkish appeal, at some stage before the termination of the Mandate and (b) that so long as the Mandate continues, machinery already exists for the consideration and redress of the grievances of any section of the population?

Incident occurred at Antioch on November 30th when Turkish elements attacked houses of three newly elected Moslem deputies to Syrian Parliament. Civil authorities invoked the aid of the military who quickly restored order. Three Turkish demon strators were killed and 17 injured. No further disturbances have taken place in Antioch. There have been no incidents anywhere else in the Sandjak. Turkish liberties have not been curtailed except in so far as certain Turkish newspapers have been banned from the Sandjak and a modified curfew is enforced in Antioch after 7.p.in. I visited Antioch and district today before receipt of your telegram and found everything quite normal everywhere. In my opinion the incident was not serious and there is no danger of recurrence in the near future. The authorities consider the situation well in hand. Military forces have been strengthened in Antioch district. French General Officer Commanding troops in Northern Syria did however state in conversation on December 11th that he hoped the League would settle the future of the Sandjak urgently since he feared the unauthorised intrusion into Syrian territory by Turkish frontier .guards or irregular bands if long delay supervened and spirits becane inflamed.

My immediately preceding telegram. and Beirat.(riS', v * L G ^ 915 i Q ^ p. ^ t &lt;3 &gt;..&gt; vj ^ Oloiections of Turkish Propos a ls Regarding Sanjak of Alexandretta. The Turkish Government have stated officially that what they are seeking to obtain is not the incorporation of the Sanjak in Turkey hut its establishment as a separate independent unit, corresponding to the separate states of Syria and of the Lebanon which it is eventually proposed to set up on the termination of the French Mandatory regime. They ,ave tentatively suggested to Sir. P. Loraine as an alternative (see Sir P. Loraine's telegram No. 177 of November 27th) that the new territory might be placed under the aegis of the League or given some international guarantee. The objections to either of these two proposals will be developed below. Meanwhile, however, not withstanding Turkish protestations, it is impossible to exclude altogether the possibility that, if the Sanjak is in fact separated from the State of Syria, as the Turks propose, it will ultimately be bsorbed by Turkey. As pointed out below, it is almost inconceivable that the Sanjak could in fact stand alone. It has no racial or linguistic cohesion, and is economically entirely dependent on one or other of its neighbours. If it were set up as an independent unit, it v/ould inevitably become a tempting field for irredentist ambition, both in Turkey and in Arabia, and since the Turks, after the interest they have taken in the question, could hardly leave Arab activity and propaganda a clear field, they would presumably be almost obliged to embark on similar activities themselves. Indeed, if only in order to prevent the Sanjak from falling back into Syria they would have to attract it towards themselves, and it is not difficult to imagine a situation in which the area would gradually be forced into increasing dependence on, and eventually almost automatic absorption by, Turkey. It is true • # •2 . true that the Turks have proposed that it should he demilitarised. But experience has shorn that demilitarisation arrangements are of little permanent value, and it would no doubt he easy enough to make a strong case when the time came to show that demilitarisation was no longer appropriate to existing conditions and that the territory should, therefore, in its own interest, he assimilated in all respects to the rest of Turkey. 2. For these reasons, it seems clear that if the territory is once separated from Syria, it will no longer he possible to count on its not ultimately becoming an integral part of Turkey. Even, however, if this were not the case, there is little doubt that other Pov/ers, especially Italy, will regard the present project as mainly designed to place at the eventual disposal of ‘Turkey and her friends, in any emergency, an important potential naval base in a new strategic area. The fact that modern railway developments in Turkey are now well on the way to linking up the G-ulf of Alexandretta, via Malatia and Erzerum, with Soviet Trans-Caucasia is hardly likely to he overlooked by those Governments who fear an extension of Soviet power into the mediterranean; and the fact that Turkey is known to he to a large extent politically dependent on Soviet Russia may well lead certain countries to form suspicions as to Turkey's ultimate motives, which, even if not wholly justified, are likely seriously to influence their attitude. 3. In view of these considerations, it is suggested that it would he a mistake to ignore the possibility of Turkey's ultimate object being either to absorb the Sanjak or at least to • • •3o to obtain an important measure of direct control over it, and the ... political objections, from the point of view of the maintenance of the status puo and the balance of power in the Mediterranean, to Turkey - and possibly, through Turkey, even Soviet Russia - acquiring a valuable new naval base in this area should not be overloouedo This possibility, indeed, may easily complicate our efforts to bring about a real Anglo-Italian detente in the Mediterranean, and this in turn might react to 'Turkey’s own disadvantage, since Turkey may well have more ground to fear Italian aggression if no Anglo-Italian understanding is reached than if our present efforts to bring about a Mediterranean de'tente succeed, l* Apart from this, the objections to cutting off the Sanjak from the rest of Syria are numerous and serious. From the political point of view, the effect on the Syrian Arabs and on the Arab world generally of cutting off Aleppo and Northern ^yria from their access to the sea is likely to be most unfortun ate. Not only might this wreck the whole if-anco-Syrian treaty, which was concluded on tne basis of the Sanjak remaining an integral part of Syria, but the Arabs might be driven to seek a new outlet to the sea at the expense of the Lebanon, and the ultimate result might be a general agitation for the revision of the 'status quo' throughout the kiddle East. The French Government have developed these arguments in their recent memorandum and pointed out that the ultimate effect of amputating tne Sanjak from the State of Syria may, from this point of view, be no less serious to British than to French interests in the Arab countries. 5. The o • •6r^i r . 4-. ^ J&gt; ^ iie S e O£ ra P^ical and economic objections to cutting off x.leppo and i'iorthern Syria (which have already been badly hit economically by the post-war settlement) from their natural access to the sea are obvious. The new territory, which, according to the xurkish tmesis, must include Antioch, would be a geographical absurdity. Its frontier would be essentially unnatural and unsounu, and it is unnecessary to stress the constant difficulties and friccion to wnich such unsound frontiers inevitably lead. 6. Fin.A_i.ly, if one Sanjak were to fall under Turkish influence or even to be threatened with ultimate absorption into Turkey, the fate of the large Christian and other non-Turkish communities (particularly in the rural districts where the Turks constitute only a small minority) and of the numerous Turkish refugees out of sympathy with the present totalitarian regime in Turkey, would present a grave problem. This problem would be lively to prove hardly less serious and troublesome than that of the disposal of the Assyrians from Iran. It is clearly to everyone s interest to prevent such another problem from arising. It may be noted that according to our information at lease 60A of the population of the Sanjak is of non-Turkish race. 7. If, on the other hand, as a guarantee against ultimate absorption by Turkey, an attempt were made to place the territory under the aegis of the League or under an international guarantee, the League or the guaranteeing States would find themselves commituec. to tne maintenance and defence of a territorial unit whose independence was politically, geographically and economically unsound, ihe Sanjak would become the centre of every kind of intrigue, and responsibilities would be engaged which it would be most difficult for the States concerned to fulfil. The example of Danzig and numerous other territories which cannot stand by themselves but which are under international or divided control renders... ik_renders it obviously desirable* at all costs, to avoid the creation of such another problem. 8. His llajesty’s Government are, of course, most anxious to do nothing viiich could adversely affect their present most friendly and cordial relations with the Turkish Government. They appreciate that the Turkish Government, ,1though certain features of the present dispute seem to have been much exaggerated, may have some legitimate ground for anxiety regarding the fate of the Turkish population of the Sanjak. There is no reason why His ilajesty's Government should not give their strong support to any measures designed to guarantee the rights and liberties of this Turkish population. But it is clear that they will, sooner or later, be obliged, for the reasons given above, to oppose the Turkish Government’s proposals for detaching the Sanjak from the State of Syria, since these proposals cannot fail to lead to serious political difficulties and to introduce a further element of instability and danger into an already sufficiently complicated international situation. The sooner the Turkish Government can be brought to realise this, the better.

You should explain that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciate motives of Turkish proposal and would be ready to sup port any measures merely designed to guarantee rights and liberties of Turkish population of Sanjak provided it is not detached from state of Syria. But they consider that Turkish proposals for de taching Sanjak cannot fail to lead to serious and far-reaching political difficulties and to introduce a further element of in stability and danger in international relations in the Mediterranean thus rendering re-establishment of peaceful atmosphere to which both Turkey and His Majesty’s Government attach so much importance more difficult. 3. If Turks reply by repeating their disclaimer of any desire to absorb Sanjak you may point out that new unit t»ould scarcelybe expected to stand alone and would be perpetual stimulant to irredentist ambitions in Turkey and Syria. Demilitarisation provisions, even when freely accepted, now have little permanent value and would afford no protection.

I HAVE the honour, with reference to my despatch No. 474 of the 12th September regarding the recently signed Franco-Syrian Agreement, to inform you that the whole local press is daily devoting a great deal of space to the future of Alexandretta and Antioch. 2. All the newspapers, while congratulating Syria on obtaining her independence, remind her that France, in 19*21, took an engagement to grant local autonomy to the Alexandretta region, and to recognise the right of the Turkish population there to special treatment. The signature of the recent agreement does not release either France or Syria from that engagement. If any change is to be made in the status of the Sanjak of Alexandretta, it can only be done by agreement between Turkey, France and Syria. Turkey which dislikes the mandatory system will not view with any favour an attempt to substitute a Syrian mandate over Alexandretta and Antioch for a French one. Nor will Turkey be silent if Syria attempts to give the Turks in the autonomous sanjak “minority treatment.” They are entitled, since 1921, to special treatment, and any whittling down of their rights would justify a demand on the part of the Turks of the sanjak for the intervention of the League of Nations or for the inclusion of the sanjak in the Turkish national boundaries, and its union to the motherland. 3. Indignation was worked up by the papers when a member of the Syrian delegation, which had halted for a time at Istanbul on its way from Paris to Syria, told reporters that Syria would give Alexandretta and Antioch the same treatment as France had given them. The newspapers pointed out that France had never kept her promises to Turkey about the Turks of the sanjak. Their life and culture had not been allowed to develop on Turkish lines. It was true that they had special schools, but these were staffed by Kurdish revolutionaries, Circassians, reactionary clerics and anachronistic supporters of obsolete alphabets. It was true, also, that they had school books from Turkey, but the picture of Ataturk had been removed from them. Syria must therefore not give the Turks of the sanjak the treatment which France had given them, but the treatment which France had been under obligation to give them. The Turks of the sanjak were looking forward to full local autonomy. If they are disappointed in this, or even— according to most of the newspapers—if they are not disappointed in this, they will look forward eagerly to the return of the sanjak to Turkey, and Turkey, on her side, will not be indifferent to their yearnings, nor unmindful of their rights. 4.
