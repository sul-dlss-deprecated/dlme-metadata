To The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire ♦ Ifeiaorandum* ±n cont[inuati&lt;)n of this office Express Letter Ho #1823 dated the 26th September, 1940, and telegram Ho #68 dated the 26th February, 1942, regarding I'assey. 2. Massey, who had had some experience and training in the Bushire Confidential Office before being posted here, was entrusted, on arrival, with passport work, registration, record-keeping and the issue of liquor permits• He did not have the advantage of instruction from his predecessor as the latter had, for sufficient reason, been allowed to leave the day before Ifessey's arrival. After making full allowance fcr this, however, I still consider that Massey made a very poor attempt to overcome the difficulties of his position, and took little or no trouble to loarn his work# In performing even the simplest duties, such as copying, he showed chronic carelessness and inaccuracy* 3. Since he left on leave no less than seven cases have come to light in which persons claim to have made applications to this Agency with fees enclosed. Investigation has revealed that the letters have either been lost or left un-registered and in none of the cases have the fees been accounted for by J/assey. In consequence I feel that it would be useless to retain him in the Persian Gulf cadre, and, as his leave was likely to expire before my recommendations could reach you, I approached the Hon'ble the Political Ai esident direct and dispensed with Massey f s services on his verbal authorisation.5* With reference to paragraph 2 of your telegram No .A/162 of the 2nd March, 1942, only two of the new recruits have so far arrived and they have been employed in the Hon'ble the Political Resident's camp office# If the third does not arrive by the next up mail alternative arrangements for Massey^ replacement will be necessary* ^ Political Agent, Bahrain./ No.762-1/40 Political Agency, Bahrain. 26th April, 1942.

Mr.Habbani tells me that his wife is expecting to produce her first child in a few months. He would therefore be grateful if he could be left here until next spring, as Dr. Steele advises against his wife travelling before the child is bom and he does not relish the prospect of a journey to Meshed in the autumn with a new-bom baby. 3. As regards aomeone to understudy passport work under Mr.Rabbani, we have at present no body suitable here except Mr.Manian, who is working in the Confidential Office. However, if you agree to let Mr.Rabbani stay here till next spring, we will doubtless have somebody suitable by then. Mr.Mohd Ashraf may perhaps fill the bill. 4.

Sir, With due respects I 'beg to lay down the following few lines for your kind consideration;- In 1938 I was serving In the Punjab Education Department as an Assistant District Inspector of Schools for Physical Train ing for about 3 years. Meansvhil® my father Mr. Moula Bakash who served loyally and faithfully the British Consulate General lleehed for 30 years died immediately after his retirement in Februay 1938. On his death I applied for a Job to the British Consulate General Meshed and was recruited and posted as Clerk in Charge, British Consular Office, Birjand. Before actually sending me to Birjand they kept me at Sahidan for 6 months on probation for study ing modern Persian. But unfortunately after 4 months the War Broke out and I had to work as a Steno to take down notes from the Fire- less set in order to compile Kews Bulletine in Hindustani and English for distribution among the Hindustani and English knowing persons in Zahidan. I worked in this capacity for 2 years after which I was transferred to Birjand to my original post and confirmed there. I was running the Consular Office Birjand independently when the Allied Forces entered Iran in August 1941. At the end of 1942 the Government of India sent a Pro-Consul at .Birjand to take s over the Birjand Consular Office and as areult of this- change my permanent post was abolished and I was sent to Msshed »9 officiating War Establishment Lower Division Clerk, ^hile at Meshed I requested for confirmation in the Cadre and Consul General Meshed recommended to BUehire that X should be confirmed in the vacancy caused by promotion of Mr, K.D. Bhaain to Special Grade. Major Howes replied that I would be given due seniority in the Cadre provided I come to Bushi:?e. I accordingly arrived in Bushire on the 15th August 1943 and in spite of the fact that Iwas not accustomed to the Gulf climate I worked hard and my superiors in the office will/^r s. bdar testimony to this, Since I hf.ve come zo t.h@ Gulf ©om« clerks have been con firmed In th#i Low«r Division end my nam*i h«£« beari overlooked# Tn * T * PV * et prmmt 3 vacancies in the Lower Division 1 request th©t if my work is found satisfactory i may kindly be confirmed in one of the vacancies and given seniority according to date of ray joining service in Persia vis,, 15th June 1939.
