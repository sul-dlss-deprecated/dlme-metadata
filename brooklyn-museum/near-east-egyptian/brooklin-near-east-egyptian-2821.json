Part of a similar floral \"collar\", which rose from the vessel's base, is also preserved. The band of incised decoration is divided into two compartments by two columns of hieroglyphic texts (New Year wishes). In the larger of the two compartments is a recumbent lion, facing left, above which is written Hr dj 'nh snb nb;, a prayer that Horus will give all life and health. The smaller compartment is subdivided into two smaller compartments by a narrow, vertical band. \r\nIn one of the smaller compartments is a bird (cf, the hieroglyph p3) above the hieroglyph for gold. In the other compartment are preserved the upper parts of an owl and of a was scepter. \r\nCondition: Large chip of the rim.
