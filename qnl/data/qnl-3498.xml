A section of notes on the papers is to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>This file originally had three foliation sequences: one that ran from 1 to 186; one that began later in the file on 151 and ran until 179; and another that followed the second sequence, running from 131 to 133. In these sequences some of the pages have been paginated, meaning that some numbers in the sequence are missing. The most complete of these foliation sequences, which is the first one, has been extended to provide a complete sequence. It is circled in pencil in the top right corner of the recto of each folio, and runs from 1 to 258, ending on the inside of the back cover of the file. This is the sequence that should be used for referencing. Foliation errors: f.34 is followed by f.34A, f.84 is followed by f.84A, f.98 is followed by f.98A, f.108 is followed by f.108A, f.117 is followed by f.117A, f.171 is followed by f.171A, f.189 is followed by f.189A. There is no f.87, f.158, f.160, or f.162.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence concerning notices to mariners including:Position, numbering and colour of beacons and light buoys on approaches to various waterways and ports including the Shatt al-Arab waterway, Ras al Tannura, Bahrain.Replacement of light beacons.Renumbering of jetties at Abadan and Bawarda.Location of wrecks of barges, dhows and ships.Change in anchorage berths.Revised procedure for the noting of marine protests (ff. 185-186).Prohibited anchorage in approaches to Bombay (f. 226).Correspondents include Port Officer, Basrah [Basra]; Adviser to the Government of Bahrain; Political Agent, Bahrain; Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company [CASOC]; Gray, Mackenzie and Company; K S Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Marine navigation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Navigational aids</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002c3#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002c3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
