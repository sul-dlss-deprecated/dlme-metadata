(a) ^he ^hief of Famriyah was at one time subor dinate to the Jawasim. (b) T het the handbook of Arabia, volume I, 1917, pae*e noints out that the headman of Hamriyah is practically independent of the Shaikh of Sharjah. 'c) ^hat Sharjah has never, to the best of P.A’s knowledge, claimed suzerainty over Eamriyah. fd) That 'H s Fajest^’s Sove-^nment have no treaty with ^amriyah as he was subordinate to the Sheikh of Sharjah when m reaties were concluded. (e) ^hat for all practical purposes, the headman of Famriyah is completely independent, and lastly, (f) ^hat, in view of oil negotiations, we should enter into engagements with the headman of Famriyah on the lines of the treaties of 1922. 2. ^hat the points raised by the Political Agent may be considered, it is necessary to summarise briefly the history of ^amriyah. ^here is no doubt that for at least 100 years Famriyah has been under the suzerainty of Sharjah. % ^his suzerainty has continued through various vicissi- % tudes from, so far as our records go, 1841 up to the present time. Tn r^nent timej, the Political Fes 1 dent informed the Government of India of Famriyah's fiefship and briefly summarised Famriyah’s status up to ttart date. It is correct to say that up to 1922 Eamriyah had, at —t^csv—o s-trnnuouo periods, been virtually independent. Ehese periods are not of great importance for Eamriyah's fiefship to Sharjah was definitely re-established in 1917 and 1922* Tn 1922 the Sheikh of Sharjah called Abdur Rahman, the headman of ^amriyahybc Sharjah. TFiile the latter was/•^77', ^ ^ XSL - /5e£^ ' f ^ z • / 2-3 Jo/ ( pe ^ / Fcv /O Mj\j&gt;.(AAf^A-^ ^“^e, &lt;^0 ^ ? /l_3 ^ 17 ; -i /? /i3 ' 3fc &lt;1 ^7 'V pJUL. 'X l n-2 3i~.

The British and the Sheikh of Sharjah combined forces, drove out Humaid^ and Ahdur ‘Rahman was set up again at ^amriyah as a fief of Sharjah. 'Ry ?'ay of 19?,?, TT umaid had again usurped, had again been turned out of Hamriyah and Abdur Bahman once more set up as a dependent of Sharjah. The P.B’s action in surporting Abdur Bahman as Headman of Hamriyah, as an appanage of Sharjah was approved by Government of India. 1 In 1916 also we had defended Sharjah suzerainty over Hamriyah by force of arms. Tn 1925 Humaid again made an attempt to oust his father from Hamriyah, but he was captured and made prisoner, this time by the Sheikh of Bmm-al-Qawain. Abdur ^ahman continued as Headman. Huch of the unrest of the past was due to intrigue, a prime mover in which was the Sheikh of Umm-al-Qawain. It is doubt'i ess due to intrigue that a volte-face was perpetrated in 1925. After all our efforts on behalf oR the Sheikh of Sharjah (Khalid bin Ahmad) to keep his fief, Abdur Hahman, in power at Hamriyah those two persons, behind the H.H’s back, and with the connivance of the 'Residency Agent, (in fact he was a witness), came to an understanding and signed a document whereby Abdur ^ahman and Hamriyah became independent of Sharjah. The above did not come to light until 1929. Abdur Rahman has since been murdered and Khalid turned out of Sharjah, so the Question now seems to turn on whether the Hhalid - Apdur ^.ahman document is binding on Sheikh Sultan bin Raoar and Humaid, the present rul-ey. '^here seems to be no conclusive proof that Sultan bin Saaar has agreed to the independence of Hamriyah though so much was concluded by the late•late 'Residency Acent. late Residency A^ent wrote tliat A'bdijr was present at a meeting when Khalid seoeded his rights over Sharjah to Sultan hin Saqar and entered into a verbal covenant with the latter, whereby he remained independent, as in the days of 'T^haiid's sheikhship. At the meeting Sultan bin Saoar could not very well take any other action. He must have known of the troubles that Hamriyah had caused in the past and considering that the tribute had dropped from one-third of the revenue, in 1841, to 2f bags of rice^Fe may well have thought it i best to let well alone. Famriyah’s independence was certainly tactically supported by naifre- of the T rucial Ooast Sheikhs and the 'Residency Agent, We do not know that Sultan bin Saaar to this day is aware of the Khalid- Abdur 'Rahman document. The Presidency Agent in his report concludes that the verbal covenant, (there is no known written covenant between Sultan bin Saner and Abdur Fahman), constitutes cognisance of Wamniyahan independence. Obviously, as we do not know what the verbal covenant was, we can draw no definite conclusion, other than that its purport must always be in doubt. In 1929, Abdur Pahman sent the Pesidency Agent thp document signed by Khalid and Abdur Hahman in which Khalid seceded his rights over Hamriyah, The Presidency Agent sent a copy of the document to the Pesidency in reply to a letter from the F,P reouesting information on th^ status of Famriyah. Tt would be most interesting to know what has happened to the original document * Considering his unauthorised action in countenancing and witnessing the document, not reporting it, and also its rather apologetic forwarding letter, I hazard a guess that the late Pesidency Agent kept the document^ and that it will probably not again come to light.c^c 2 D In 19?1, old '^oadm^T) A'bdur P^atiman was murdered, (not t&gt;y Fuma^d), and after a short period of unrest Fumaid, the same Fumaid who had caused most of the trouble of the past 2° years, and who had previously set himself un as independent of Sharjah, established himself as Feadman. It was at this time th^t the Polltioal Pesident wrote to the Government of India statin* th^t Famriyah was a fief of Sharjah (thereby over-rulin* Gol. Barrett's noting) and suggesting that Famriyah could perhaps be considered independent, but that in view of the recent murders he considered matter should be left as they were for the present, and that if the situation changed the matter could be considered afresh. In 1932 a plot, hatched by three men of Hamriyah to murder Fumaid was frustrated by the latter, Furcaid is still ^eadman of Famriyah. ^be important point to note in this last plot is that the Sheikh o^ Sharjah concerned himself in the punishment o^ the plotters and in a letter to the 'Residency Agent, in which he washed his hands of any complicity in the plot, called the plotters his subjects. Fery briefly the historical aspect boils down to (a) up to 192? Famriyah was clearly an appanage of Sharjah, (b) From 1923 to 1927 it was seeretely consi dered independent, (c) In 1927 a new Sheikh of Sharjah is reported to have verbally covenanted with the headman o^ ^amriyah. (d) In 1932 the Sheikh of Sharjah takes an interest in Famriyah's affairs and calls some of its peonle his subjects. Famriyah indenend^n41y&gt;, the Sheikh of Sharjah is most unlikely to exert his lordship over Famriyah while 7o my mind, considering Fumaid's effortsb -5- cv- any tlmp circumstances may change^Jie, or another dLu£-**J^) Shaikh oi’ ^har e 1?)h, could A geaa^ with justice. m he events of the last few years do not, I think, constitute a basis for concluding that the Sheikh of Sharjah does not consider Hamriyah a a part of his dominlons. At the moment the Question of the dependence of Famriyah does not require a definite statement hut, in view of oil negotiations, it may do so at any moment. Should a definite line of action he necessary T think that (a)long historical dependence (h) actions taken in 1917 and 1922, (c) that the document was kept secret and its validity has never been established (d) that the document may be lost and ( e; that in 1931 Sultan bin Saoar considers some people of ^amriyah ashis subjects, must incline Hi s Majesty’s '’Government to uphold Sharjah’s suzerainty.

Tine question of Hamriyeia in connection witn Oil may possibly come to a nead wnile I am on leave. io\x will see from tne file a very useful note by Captain Calloway wnicn gives tde wnole situation. 2. Up to now the question of whether hamriyeh is independent of Sharjah nas not been of mucn importance. With the development of Petroleum Concession himi tea's activities, however, the case is altered. If we were to acknowledge Hamriyeh as independent of Sharjah, it would mean that the Company would have to get anotner expensive oil concession wnen they have been given to understand 'fey us, that provided tney get concessions from tne Snaikns with whom we have Treaties, this would put them in complete possession cf the Tfucial Coast. This is a point which Captain Hickinbotham does not seem to nave envisaged in his letter No,C-523-10/12 of the otn July 195 7. 3. Prom Captain Galloway's note I am definitely of tne opinion that Hamriyeh is under Snarjah. In tne first place since 1848 3har j ah has had suzerainty over Hamriyeh, and no question of the suzerainty arose until as recently as 1927. In fact in 1916 and in 1922 we bombarded Hamriyeh on behalf of Sharjah in order to keep his representative (headman) there. 4. In 1927 Khalid^ the Shaikn of Sharja h^abdicat ed in favoir- of the present man, Sultan bin Saqqar, and at a meeting of the (Prucial Shaikhs ,^among whom was the headman of Hamriyeh) ? in 1927 on board H.M.S.'Triad« (at wnich the Residency Agent was present but no Political Officer; some sort of verbal agreement was come to as between the Shaikhs themselves with regard to Haueriyeh, 5./ ir~0 - 2 - 5. In 1929 a document came to ligftt signed in 1923 by wnich Knalid gave to Abdul Ranman tne tnen Headman of Hamr iy eh (afterwards murdered) independence for nimself and the town. This document was witnessed by the tnen Residency Agent who has since died. This document has some weight in itself but it was for ^ years kept secret and we were not informed about it and the Residency Agait hadjno authority to witness it. tie ought, of course, to have reported it. It is significant that at the meeting on TRIAD in 1927 this document was not produced and in my opinion does not bind His Majesty^ Government in ary way. Sir Hugh Riscoe reported the matter to the Government of and in his last paragraph, as you will see, expressed tne opinion that Hamriyeh n was a fief of Sharjah*. It does in any way binding on His Majesty’s Government. 7. as far as the present Shaikh of Sharjah is concerned you will see - vide his letter of the 13th April 1932, he definitely refers to ’’ray subjects'. By his subjects he means men of Haunriyeh and net men of Sharjah who happened to be living in Hamriyeh, for the subjects referred to one Rashid bin Muhamad bin Cj said bin Abdullah al Yas i and Waj id bin Abdullah Awaizi, all three men of Harariyeh. These men are the conspirators who tried to nave Hama id murdered and it is concerning proof against them that Sultan bin Saqqar refers to them as his subj ects• 8.

Captain T. Hickinbotham, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain &lt;/ % % The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject:- Himriyah . © I have the honour to state that during my recent visit to the Trucial Coast I went into the question of the status of the Shaikh of Himriyah, 2. Hirariyah is a fairly large town situated on the Trucial Coast about half way between the towns of Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain. The chief of Himriyah is Shaikh Hu- maid bin Abdur Rahman and he is from the Al Bu Shamis tribe. The town itself which is smaller than Ajman is populated by a mixed collection who do not belong to any particular tribe. As far as X have been able to ascertain there is no hinterland of any appreciable size attached to the town. The chief of Himriyah was at one time sub ordinate to the Jawasim but was noted as being practically independent of the Shaikh of Sharjah in the Handbook of Arabia, Volume I 1917, page 336. He is now for all practi cal purposes conqpletely independent of the Shaikh of Shar— jah and is ranked by the local people as an independent Shaikh. The Shaikh of Sharjah, to the best of my know- ledge and belief, has not claimed suzerainty over the Shaikh of Hirrrriyah.* °K -a- 3. We have no treaty with the Shaikh of Himriyah as at the time at which our treaties were made he was rightly considered to be subordinate to the Jawasim Shaikh of Sharjah. In view of the present competition ... ^ 11 ri( . 1 ... for oil concessions I think we should enter into engage— ments with the Shaikh of Himriyah in particular on the ' i * i * E ** iS4 . 7 lines of our agreements regarding Oil signed in 1922 with the remaining Trucial Shaikhs.

I read your note with great interest as I have no re cord in my office of these happenings. I should not be surprised if the document came to light. 2. It may interest you to know that the Shaikh of Hira, the father-in-law of Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar, holds a document granting him his independence. This document is not mislaid and the old gentleman has it in safe cus- tody. Sharjah’s affairs are very complicated and he is afraid to commit himself in any way regarding his posses sions. I have been unable to extract his claims from him as regards his area and have now in deference to the Political Resident's wishes ceased to press him. The truth is that he does not know what to claim as he knows that his de facto control at the moment only extends a few miles inland from Sharjah. He has not been to Dhaid for seventeen years. He remains on the Coast in the summer not because he likes it but because he dare not go inland. As you know all the others go to the interior in the summer. His young son Saqar, grandson of Abdur Rahman, Shaikh of Hira, the next vil lage northward, is a very different type and is now worth ten of his father. 3.
