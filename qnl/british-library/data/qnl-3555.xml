Wonckhaus and Company has written to the Sheikh of Bahrein asking for permission to put up a flagstaff and fly a flag on it whenever a German steamer may be in port. The pattern of the flag was not indicated in his letter to the Sheikh, but Mr. Eisenhut informed Captain Prideaux that he eventually wished to fly the flag of the Hamburg -American Line, but that meanwhile in the case of the first visit or two of the latter Company's steamers he would like to fly the German Flag. I may mention that he was expecting the German Consul, Bushire, as a passenger by the first steamer. 2. The Sheikh replied that the proposal constituted an innovation and regretted that he did not see his way to consent, and he told Captain Prideaux in conversation that he objected strongly. Mr. Eisenhut then asked Captain Prideaux to move me in the matter and the latter asked for instructions as to what to reply. I was obliged to send him a reply by the same steamer and informed him on the 29th instant that the matter primarily rested with the Sheikh s pleasure, and that as the British India Company's Agent at Bahrein had never been permitted to fly a flag, there seemed no reason why the German Line should be treated differentially ; I authorised him to maintain that attitude, until I had been able to refer the question for the views of Government. 3. It may be remembered that the same question occurred at Maskat in the case of Monsieur Goguyer, who was very anxious to fly the flag of the Russian- Odessa Line of which he was Agent. On that occasion His Highness the Sultan refused to acquiesce, on the same grounds, namely that the Agents of the three or four other Lines which plied regularly to Maskat had not been so permitted and that there was no reason for any fresh departure now. In Bushire, the Agents for the various Steamship Companies are indeed allowed to fly flags, but this is a more civilised port, where the nature of flags is less likely to be misunderstood. On the Arab side there are in my opinion objections to the multiplication of flags and flagstaffs, especially those of Foreign nationality, and if the Government of India see no objection I think we should support the Sheikh in his desire to keep them out.

He promised to give his thought to the ques tion of enabling Shipping Companies to signal to their ships, but I do not feel much hope of any useful result. In the meantime I am afraid all that can be done is to ask you to take do™ the Flagstaff. Yours sincerely. C. Macpherson, Esq., f 4 Gray Paul &amp; Co., Bahrein.GRAY iTSfpast the auestion of our 'being allowed to erect a flagstaff for signalling purposes ias teen; raie r oi. good many occasions. Dut so far this nas not teen sanctioned. I now ijatt^to ask whether - you could not taKe up this matter again with the Sheikh and induce him to allow us to erect such a flagstaff on our premises. It is really most necessary that we should 'be atle to signal off to steamers and it would facilitate om work very greatly were we ral^le to do so» As an example to shew the necessity for our heing in a position to signal steamers^ would auote the case of the -Barjora' a week e ^ o when as you are aware^a serious disturbance between some ^Sowar'passengers and Arab hoatmen took place. The steamer signalled us urgently that she required police but it was quite impossible for us to coiamunicate with or to reply her at all except by letter which meant a lapse of at least ^ to 3 houia of valuable time before we were in possession of full facts and particulars. Also steamers nowadays bring up o or 4 times tae quantity of cargo that they used to do some years back which means that all steamer work has correspondingly increased and time nowadays is more valuable than previously, I hope you will 'be ahle to help us in tins.Bahrein,the 22nd February 19i4 Dear Maophereon, Please see your letter of 15th Novenber 1913 re garding a flagstaff for airmailing purposes on your proTniseo. At the end of last year I was so busy in various ways that I had no time to speak to the Shailrh about the 'natterj and although I.have had the papers with me on several occasions when I visited the Shaikh I have never had time to p-et to the on i i, riday # and find him still very much opponed to the idea. The most he would do was to promise to think over it t whioh will not I fear result in much. 5 steamship Oomp ies* Agents and if one company ha® a flagstaff, all the others will press for one,and eventually (especially if more companies open Agencies) the place will be studded with flagstaffs. Secondly he says that no flagstaffs exist in other Arab Ports (ife, Vuscat Debai and Foweit) and in this I believe Possibly if your A^ent at Koweit could get the Shaikh there to sanction the erection of a signalling flagstaff on your promises the Shaikh's second objection could be overcome. I am not so sure about his first however. subject• However at i ,ast I had a long conversation with him His chief fear islthink that as there are already Tours sincerely.

HO Many thanks for your letter of 25th February, 'but I am sorry to hear that the Sheikh is still very opposed to allowing &amp; us flagstaff for signalling purposes. Re his argument that no Flagstaff exists at other Ara'b ports, viz, Muscat, Dubai &amp; Koweit, he is certainly ^xong so far as the latter is concerned, as we have a Flagstaff there and always fly the Company's flag, and no objection whatsoever has 'been raised to this practice 'by Sheikh Motarak.

The main correspondents in the file are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, or staff from the Residency, the Political Agent in Bahrain, and Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah. The posts of Political Resident and Political Agent were held by a number of incumbents during the period covered by the file.The German film Wonckhaus &amp; Company, and the British firm Gray Paul &amp; Company, both had offices in Bahrain, and were agents for the steamship companies using the island’s main port. Both companies made repeated applications to fly flags, via the Political Agency, to Shaikh ‘Īsá during the period covered by the file. On each occasion however, Shaikh ‘Īsá refused permission to allow the flying of flags, with it being reported that he regarded the practice as an innovation improper for himself, and disrespectful to him as a ruler (folios 17-18a). The Political Agent, operating as an intermediary between Wonckhaus/Gray Paul and Shaikh ‘Īsá, offered the use of their own flagstaff to the steamship agencies when required (folio 16).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Steamships</topic></subject><subject><topic>Signals and signalling</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002ee#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
