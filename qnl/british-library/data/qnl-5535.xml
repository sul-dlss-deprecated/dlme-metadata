With regard to meeting the cost of the construction of the servants' quarters from the budget provisions for the current year, I have the honour to point out that wholly to do so would be impossible as there are other urgent works which must be carried out this year. 3. In the schedule of demands for ’original works', forwarded with my letter No.2073/59/14, dated the 8th October, 1936, a sum of Rs.25,900 was estimated as required for major works and Rs.8,500 for minor works but against my demands only Rs. 28,000 have been sanctioned and that sum I propose to expend on the following urgently required works:- (1) Renewal of electric wiring in Government buildings at Bushire- vide Central Public Works Construction of servants' qua±uvn&gt; at Bahrain. i pf Department Express Letter N0.2/BR of 1st April 1937 Rs.12,300 (2) Construction of mechanic's quarters at Muscat Rs. 4,000• The Uhcisr Secretary t»o the Govemi.ont of India In the External Affairs Dapartraent, To - The Hon'hie the Political Refiiuent In Uie Persian Gulf, BushIre.

Resident in the Persian Gulf put forward to the Government of India proposals for rebuilding the servants’ quarters at the Bahrein Agency at an estimated cost of Rs.12000. The work was, however, not sanctioned in 1935/6 and sufficient funds . for it were not available in 1936/7. The Government of India consider that it is undesirable that the scheme should be further postponed, and provision has been made in the Budget for 1937/8. 2. In view of the fact that the Medical Officer has condemned the present quarters, and reports that they are responsible for much of the illness amongst the Agency servants, it is obviously desirable that the scheme should be put in hand as soon as possible. 3. The proposal that in future the cost of the Bahrein Agency should be shared between Imperial and Indian Revenues was put to the Foreign Office on the b ^4th November last, and is still under consideration by the Treasury. A scheme for the reorganisation of the Political Agent’s office, involving additional expenditure, was recently submitted, and it was ascertained that the Treasury would not consider accepting a moiety of the cost until a. decision on the general proposal had been reached. The scheme was therefore sanctioned and the Foreign Office were asked to regard the additional expenditure as part of the general proposal. It is understood from the Foreign Office that some time must still elapse before the Treasury’s decision can be expected, asL. Bahrein’ha expenditure is only part of the large question of incidence of expenditure in Persia and the Gulf which H.M.G. have under consideration, and it is equally unlikely that i. r 5:iU!B 5000 10/36 the/the Treasury will at present accept a moiety of the cost of rebuilding the servants’ quarters. It is therefore submitted that the proposals of the Government of India should be sanctioned forthwith, the Foreign Office being asked that in the event of the cost of .Bahrein being shared the additional expenditure involved should also be regarded as included in the arrangement. 4. One other point arises. In the case of diplomatic and consular posts in Persia the arrangement has ^#^long been that capital expenditure should be borne wholly by the Government primarily responsible for the post, although other expenditure has been shared. In the case of the Koweit Agency on the Arab side of the Gulf it was agreed with-the Treasury in 1931 that capital expenditure (on buildings) should be shared in the same way as other expenditure. If a moiety of the cost of Bahrein is accepted as a charge on Imperial Revenues the Koweit, and not the Persian, arrangement should obviously apply, but as the point was not referred to when the general proposal was made to the Foreign Office it might be put to them now for acceptance. 5.

Although the Political Resident’s proposal ms considered be sound and necessary in the interests of the health of the inferior establishment at Bahrain, it ms not found x^ossible to provide the necessary funds in the budget estimates for the curren year. Suitable provision has now been made for the scheme in the budget estimates for 1937^38. 3. The question of the division of Bahrain expenditure betwegj the Government of India'and His Majesty’s Government is still ^ consideration, vide Walton’s letter No.P.3.7103/36, dated the ot November 1936. The principle of division of costs would apply also to works expenditure on the analogy of Kuwait Agency Buildings and accordingly a moiety of the cost of the reconstruction of the servants’ quarters would be debitable to His Majesty’s Government. AsAs it is not desirable to postpone the scheme further, pending a decision on the general question, it is requested that sanction to the Political Residents proposal may be accorded, and the consent of His Majesty f s Government obtained to treat the expenditure as part of the general proposals** Reference in this connection is invited to the Secretary of State’s telegram No.3730, dated the 29th December 1936, regarding the Bahrain Jigency Office.

It was not, however, found possible to sanction this work in 1935-36. 3. I would request a reference to the attached plan which shows where the servants* quarters of the Bahrain Agency are situated. There are two blocks, *A * which contains ten quarters and *B* which contains five quarters. The building at *C* is a block of six stables, one of which has been fitted with a door and is used as a garage. This arrangement of the servants* quarters and stables, though unduly close to the Agency building, did not matter much in the past, as all visitors rode and came through the main entrance. Cars, which are now universally used, have to proceed by the red dotted lines through the gate *D*, and must pass by the servants* quarters and stables. It is not fitting that visitors to t he Agency (including2 * for example| the Buler of Bahrain) should have to enter through suoh surroundings# fc’hen the new wing is huilt, it will he preferable for the old main gate *E f to he made passable for motors and for the motor way to lead up to the main entrance as shown on the plan in blue dotted lines, but this postulates the removal of the servants* quarters block *A\ The present gate *1) would cease to exist# 4# The servants* quarters themselves, both block 'A* and biook *B* t are very old, cramped and delapldated. They are of local construction of ooral rock, hewn out of the sea, and are so impregnated with salt, that it is impossible to keep them dry, and the Medical Officer, in condemning them on the grounds of their dampness, lack of ventilation and unhealthy condition, reports that much of the illness among servants of the Agency is due to the state of these quarters* It is impossible to reconstruct them, and patching does not improve them and is a waste of good money# 5# The Political Agent now employs Arabs, who live out, for the crew of the launch and is, therefore, prepared to have fewer servants* quarters, that is to say eleven quarters in place of the existing fifteen quarters# He proposes (a) to remove the old stables and garage (0 dn plan), which are as old and delapidated as the servants’ quarters, as there will be too great a congestion when the new wing is built, and (b) to build new servants* quarters and to provide a garage as shown in green dotted lines on the plan# The removal of the old stables, some of which were used as storerooms, will necessitate the provision of two store-rooms/to the servants* quarters# 6# A sum of Hs# 12,000/* has been included in the budget estimates for 1936-37, and I request that sanction3. may 'be accorded to the rebuild lug of the servants* qu&amp;rter8 f garage and storerooms as proposed* 7* It would he convenient and economical if this work were to he carried out at the same time as the building of the Indian Assistant’s Court p which involves the demolition of buildings adjoining block •B # of the old servants* quarters* 1 have the honour to be 9 Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Sd) Oordon loch, Sffg* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000e1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3663</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000e1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3663</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 29/87 'Bahrain Agency: provision of new servants' quarters'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1935/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-09-25T10:50:39</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (14 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 16; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the construction of servants' quarters at the Political Agency in Bahrain and includes a plan of the Agency building (f 15).The file is composed of correspondence between the Foreign Office, the India Office, the Government of India, and the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Building operations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000e1#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
