The Sultan. l.J/' isritish Agent, The following is an extract of an article which appeared in the Civil &amp; Military (iazette of Sunday, April 3rd, 1949. SJULCL^-L-IJU* . Syed woor Muhammad shah, Sind^ Civil Supplies Minister, has proposed to the rakistan liovemment extraordinary measures to check the smuggling of food grains across the rakistan border into adjacent Indian and Indian States territory, if his pro posals. particularly that relating to a 10-mile no man‘s land along the border, sure endorsed, smuggler will in future be talking their lives in their hands wnenevBr they engage in their nefarious enterprise, unfortunately, the rewards are so great that even this risk will probably not put an end to grain- runn ing. A difference in rakistan and Indian market prices of any thing up to Rs.15/- per maund is sufficient to permit the pay ment ox heavy bribery and yet leave a substantial margin or profit. That profit is large enough to prompt smugglers not only to deprive government of a substantial source of revenue (by a duty on exported surplusses; but also to take bread out of their fellow-countrymen‘s mouths. There is reason to believe that the elaborate system whereby smugglers enjoy the law's “averted eye**, or even Protection in the gangster sense, will minimise tbe danger to life iwhich Syed woor Muhammad Sh&amp;h would increase; just as so far it has minimised the risk of detection, wot only the local constable and the local petty official are alleged to be involved in a racket which offers rich rewards. The Central Government will presumably gran&gt; all powers to the Sind Ministry in its efforts to stamp out smuggling, but even a 'shoot-at-sight' order will be ineffective unless there is a weeding out of those who betray the State - for a consideration - by turning a blind eye on the smugglers* activities.SQUMimL* MQ. lS-7 of 194^. hFM,. 6 ) w g MQvanent of oritiah Officiala a others. 72. _ Three British Subjects from the (Jovemaent of Pakistan arrived from hasni on the 10th. at about 10 a.m. local ti^ef They arrived in the motor launch “Majidiah*. on their arrival here ,^ey »iaited the Wall first then later visited the Administrator, on the 11th. morning they called on me at office and it was learnt from their conversationj they had been sent out by the Pakistan ’ government on a survey in connection with fisheries, rhey were la fS e amount of fish caught here and added their surprise at the niiaber allowed to go waste.
