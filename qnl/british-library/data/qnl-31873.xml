(viii)IX Extract from Queen Victoria's Proclamation, 1858. “ We hereby announce to the Native Princes of India that all Treaties and Engagements made with them by or under the authority of the Honourable East India Company are by Us accepted and will be scrupulously observed ; and We look for the like observance on their part. We desire no extension of Our present Territorial Possessions ; and while We will admit no aggression upon Our Dominions or Our rights to be attempted with impunity, We shall sanction no encroachment on those of others. We shall respect the rights, dignity, and honour of Native Princes as Our own ; and We desire that they, as well as Our own subjects, should enjoy that prosperity and that social advancement which can only be secured by internal peace and good Government.” Extract from King Edward VIPs Coronation Message. “ To all My feudatories and subjects throughout India, I renew the assurance of My regard for their liberties, of respect for their dignities and rights, of interest in their advancement, and of devotion to their welfare, which are the supreme aim and object of My rule, and which, under the blessing of Almighty God, will lead to the increasing prosperity of My Indian Empire, and the greater happiness of its people.” Extract from King George V’s Speech at the Delhi Coronation Darhar, 1911. “ Finally, I rejoice to have this opportunity of renewing in My own person those assurances which have been given you by My revered predecessors of the maintenance of your rights and privileges and of My earnest concern for your welfare, peace, and contentment.X May the Divine favour of Providence watch over My people and assist Me in My utmost endea vour to promote their happiness and prosperity. To all present, feudatoiies and subjects, I tender Our loving greeting.’' Extract from King George F’s Proclamation, 1919. “ I take the occasion again to assure the Princes of India of my detenuination ever to maintain un impaired their privileges, rights and dignities.” Extract from King George F’s Proclamation, 1921. In My former Proclamation 1 repeated the assurance given on many occasions by My Royal pre decessors and Myself, of My determination ever to maintain unimpaired the privileges, rights and dignities of the Princes of India. The Princes may rest assured that this pledge remains inviolate and inviolable.”INTRODUCTION. This Manual is the result of an attempt to con- dense into handy shape the more im portant rules of procedure that have from time to time been laid down. The instructions in the Manual are, so far as they go, authoritative, but many orders are not included. All existing orders not specifically incorporated in the Manual remain in force. 2. As far as possible questions of policy have not been touched, for such questions cannot be reduced to terms of compendious generalisation. 1 he circum stances of States vary enormously as^ regards treaties, local conditions, economic and political, and the idio- syncracies of Ruling Princes and Chiefs. All these circumstances have to be considered in dealing with political questions as they arise. Each case has to be considered on its merits, the object being to attain a result satisfactory at once to the Imperial (Tovern- ment and the Darbar. Precedents are valuable as a guide, but no more. They can only safely be fol lowed when all conditions are the same ; and condi tions, as between different States, are rarely the same’. Even in the matter of procedure it is not possible to secure uniformity without the sacrifice of larger interests, and the rules in the Manual must in practice be elastic. Any substantial deviation from them should, however, be referred for the orders of the Government of India. 3 But while uniformity is unattainable and un desirable in itself, it is necessary to have some general instructions for the guidance of young officers joining the Department, in order to enable them to deal successfully with Darbars, to focus their ideas and to catch the true proportion of the questions which may come before them in detail. Such instructions are given in the following paragraphs. (xi)xii General Instructions. 1. The first duty of a Political Officer is to cultivate direct, friendly, personal relations with the Ruling Princes and Chiefs with whom he works. This has been the practice of all great Political Offi cers from Sir John Malcolm to Sir David Barr. A Political Officer as the representative of the Impe rial Government has a dual function ; he is the mouthpiece of the Government and the custodian of Imperial policy ; but he is also the interpreter of the sentiments and aspirations of the Darbar. In the exercise of this dual function he will gradually acquire an experience and attitude of mind which will lead him instinctively to right and sound courses of action. But at the outset certain rules of conduct will assist him, and these may now be briefly stated:— {i) He should assume an identity of interest between the Imperial Government and the Darbar and discuss questions freely in oral conversation ; while the ordinary principles of public business require that there should be a written record of the proposals, the principal phases of nego tiation, and the final decision in any case, written correspondence with Darbars should be reduced as far as possible, and all letters except on purely routine sub jects should be drafted by himself in a punctiliously courteous style ; he should avoid employing intermediaries. (n) He should always endeavour to place himself in the position of the Darbar and endeavour to realise the Darbar’s point of view. (m) He should ordinarily refrain from offer ing advice unless it is sought, particularly in the matter of appointment, promo tion and punishment of Darbar officials ; when his advice is sought he should give it freely, but in the matter of appoint ments be should bp verv careful to adviseXlll the employment of State subjects wher- ever this is possible. (tt') He should be careful to uphold the dignity of the Darbar ; he should not interfere between the Darbar and its subjects, nor encourage petitions from the latter against the former i nor should he on his tours inspect the district offices and institutions except at the wish or invitation of the Darbar. {v) He should avoid doing anything which could violate or abate any pledge or engagement given by the British Gov ernment or a British officer. (vi) He should leave well alone ; the best work of a 1 olitical Officer is very often what he has left undone. He will ordinarily find hisTelations with Darbars made easy if he cultivates frankness, courtesy patience, tact, care in matters of ceremonial, and above all, readiness to see the good in things and slowness to criticise. 2. The policy of the Government of India is a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of btates, but there are exceptions to this policy, though they are rare Having guaranteed internal independ ence to the States, and having undertaken their protection against external aggression, the Imperial Government have assumed some responsibilitv for the maintenance of order and fairly efficient goVern- ment in them, and cannot consent to incur the re proach of being an indirect instrument of oppression. The degree of misrule which will call for interference is a question for decision on its merits in each case. It may be stated generally that, unless misrule reaches a pitch which violates the elementarv laws of civilisation the Imperial Government will usuallv prefer to take no overt measures for enforcing reform'- ; any ca f® attempt to reform should, so long as is possible, be confined to personal suasion. 3 Circumstances have dictated the necessity for regulating certain matters, either because they areXIV of Imperial concern or because the States require some protection. The chife of these i elate to (а) The employment of Europeans, Americans, and Australians by Indian States. (б) The regulation of mining concessions and railway enterprise. (c) Coinage. (d) Military co-operation. (e) Imperial Post Office, telephones and telegraphs. (f) Railway management and jurisdiction. ig) Opium and fiscal arrangements. The orders of the Government of India on all the above subjects should be carefully studied when ever any question concerning them arises m a practical form. # 4. The Governor-General in Council is. opposed to anything like pressure on Darbars to introduce British methods of administration. He prefers that reforms should emanate from the Darbar, and grow up in harmony with the traditions of the btate. Administrative efficiency is at no time the only or indeed the chief object to be kept m view. This should speciallv be borne in mind by officers charged temporarily with the administration of a State during a minority, whether they are m sole charge, or asso ciated with a State council. They occupy a position of peculiar trust, and should never forget that their primary duty is the conservation of the customs of the State. Abuses and corruption should be correct ed as far as possible ; but the. general system of administration to winch the Prince and the people have become accustomed should be unchanged m ail essentials. The methods sanctioned by tradition in States-are generally well adapted to the needs and relations of the ruler and people. The loyalty o the latter to the former is generally a personal loyalty, which administrative efficiency, if carried out on lines unsuited to local conditions, would lessen or impair.t Manual of Instructions to Officers of the Political Department of the Governme it of India. CHAPTER i. Official correspondence, etc. 1. In all official correspondence the point or C j Home Dept . Official correspondence. . points to which attention Reso'ln. No. 768,' is directed should be clear- dated 18th Ma y ly indicated in the letter about to issue in such a ciJ^No^am-ST’ manner that a reference to enclosures of the letter a., dated 12 th may not be necessary in order to ascertain what 8 ^- 1902 » For * questions are submitted for decision or what subjects ^s.'g Cir ’ dated are communicated for information. The enclosures 16 th Oot. 1908. of a letter should include no paper which is not essential to a proper understanding of the question dealt with. So far as possible'each letter should be confined to the treatment of a single subject, reference being made, where necessary, to separate letters dealing with connected questions. Any reference to a letter or resolution of the Government of India, or to previous correspondence, whether in the opening paragraph or in the body of a letter, or its enclosures, should be specific and pre cise, and comprise the date, year, number (with the letters if any affixed thereto) and the Depart ment. Any allusion to a circumstance, or an event, of which the Government is supposed to be cognisant should be accompanied by a marginal reference to the paper in which it was reported, or, where this precision is not possible, the best clue that can be given should be afforded to permit of the matter being traced without unnecessary difficulty.

In all cases of territorial distribution or disputes, or where reference is made to localities but little known or whenever a map would elucidate a case, it is desirable that such a map or sketch should be forwarded, or that an allusion should be made to some well-known map. In the event of sudden disturbances, when such a map or reference is not immediately available, it should follow the first report as soon as possible. The head of every official Tetter should show the name as well as the official designation of the writer, and special care should be taken to ensure that the name as well as the designation is trans cribed on any copy of such a letter which may be forwarded to the Government of India. Vernacular terms to be avoided. 2. The use of vernacular terms in official correspondence should be avoided as far as possible. In any case in which their use appears necessary the nearest English equivalent should be added paren thetically. 3. Vernacular documents should not ordinarily Translations to accompany ver- be forwarded to the Gov- nacuiar documents. eminent of India.

But the substance of the letter containing the instructions should, unless there are special reasons to the contrary, be communicated in sufficient fullness to enable the Durbar to under stand the reasons for the decisions embodied in the letter and as far as may be in the language used by the Government of India. \ 1 I 4 V 1 I £\ t 1 t ' * 3 The foregoing rule does not apply to obviously non-confidential documents emanating from other Departments of the Government of India communi cated through the foreign and Political Department. 5.

When any matter touching the interests or Views and sentiments of Dur- feelings of a Durbar forms . to , b ® « et out full y b J local the subject of a commu- . mcation by a Political Officer to superior authority, it is important that the views and sentiments of the Durbar should be fully stated.

Indian States and Capi talists and Financial Agents. lists and Financial Agents :— (i) It is very desirable in the interests of the Government of India and in its own interests that a State intending to issue a public loan should give information beforehand of its intention to do so in order to give the Government of India an opportunity of offering friendly advice on the subject, if necessary. Ihis will not apply to the case of short loans for temporary purposes only from banks recognised for this purpose by the overn ment of India. (it) European British subjects are already legally forbidden to make loans to Ruling Princes and Chiefs without the previous con sent in writing of the Secretary of State in Council or of the Governor General in Council or of a Local Government. e previous concurrence of the Government of India is requir by States entering into loan transactions with alien persons or firms. The term ‘ alien ’ is not applicable to British Indian subjects or subjects of other Indian States. (Hi) Loans by one State to another require the consent of the Govern ment of India. (iv) The acceptance of a directorship in a Company in British India by a Ruling Prince or Chief is considered undesirable and derogatory to the position of Indian Princes. This principle does not, however, apply to the case of officials o an j&gt; n ian State representing the State on the Board of Directors. 0 /.

The levy of such a duty must place some re striction on free transit and commerce between State territory and British India, and it is therefore the ordi nary practice to invite States to assist in attaining the end in view by the alternative of the levy by the autho rity of the State of an excise duty equivalent to that contemplated by the Act. The plan is one which while fiscally advantageous to the State removes the need for the restrictions above mentioned. 19. I. When a proposal is made that a railway For. &amp; Pol. Dept*, should traverse State territory, the State or States f^atwi^h Dec Construction and maintenance concerned will be afforded 1923 . of railways in Indian States. f u ]l opportunity of making representations on the subject, and such represen tations will receive most careful consideration. Except when the proposed railway is required for strategic purposes, nothing will, in the absence of mutual agreement, be done which is calculated to infringe the sovereign rights of the States. If after full examination of all possible routes for a proposed strategic railway it is found that there is more than one alternative feasible route, one traversing a State and the other avoiding it, the wishes of the State concerned will, provided condi tions are approximately equal, not be overruled. II. Subject to the fulfilment of the conditions laid down in paragraph I, no railway survey will'be commenced in State territory unless the object and general alignment of the projected railway have been fully explained to the State and its consent obtained. A State will not, by consenting to a sur vey, commit itself in any way to concurrence in the new project. III. When the survey of a projected line is being made, the officer-in-charge of the survey will consult the State concerned as to the alignment in the State which would best serve the commercial and other interests of the State, and while adhering to the general direction indicated in his instructions, M1FD B10 endeavour as far as possible to meet the wishes of the State. IV. When the surveys for a projected railway have been completed and information is available to enable a decision to be reached as to whether its construction should be undertaken, and if so, which route would be most suitable, the State or States concerned will be afforded ample opportunity for expressing their views in regard to both these points. Their views will also be invited as to the extent to which they should participate in the scheme, should the line pass through their territory, and the effect which it may produce on any railway system of their own. The necessary details, such as the extent of the participation, if any, of the State in the scheme and in the construction and working of the line, will be agreed upon before construction is begun. V. The Government of India desire to encourage the investment of funds by States in railways con structed within State territories, and in the case of railways to be constructed by the Government of India contributions will ordinarily be accepted from States subject to the following conditions :— (i) the net earnings or losses of the railway shall be divided between Government and the States concerned in proportion to the capital contributed by each ; (ii) the railway will as a rule be controlled en' tirely by the Government of India, but where a State has a substantial interest in the capital of a line passing through its territory, it shall, whenever practic able, be given suitable representation on the Advisory Board or Committee of such Railway ; (in) the investment made by a State will ordi narily be regarded as a permanent one, and a State will not part with its in terest or any portion of its interest in the line except to the Government of India or to an assignee approved by Govern ment, on the same conditions as bind11 the holder, or on terms approved by the Government of India. {iv) the Government of India will be under no obligation to purchase a State’s interest in the line at any time ; nor will a State be under an obligation to sell its interest at any time ; but if a State wishes to sell and the Government of India agree to buy, or vice versa, the terms of transfer will ordinarily be based on the terms governing the purchase of branch lines for the time being, but will be subject to variation by mutual agreement. VI. In the case of a State owning shares in a Railway Company, there is no objection to the State parting with such shares as an ordinary shareholder. VII. States will also be encouraged to invest funds on a profit-sharing basis in lines outside their owm territory in w r hich they are interested. Each application will be considered on its merits and facilities will be granted to contribute, it being understood that the matter is entirely in the discre tion of the Government of India. When making a decision, Government will ordinarily take into consideration, inter alia :— (i) whether the line is adjacent to the applicant State ; and (u) the amount of contribution which the in terests of the applicant State entitle it to make. The terms regarding distribution of profits and management of the line will be matters for separate determination in each case, and the principles laid down in paragraph V (Hi) and (iv) will be applicable mutatis mutandis to the transfer or purchase of a State’s interest in the line. VIII. (?) The assent of the Government of India Construction of railways by an essential preliminary States within or outside their to the Construction Or CX- own territory. , tension of any railway by a State. The reasons for this are as follows :— Although the Government of India desire in , every way to encourage useful railway12 construction by States, it must often happen that a railway line planned by one State will, if carried out, affect pre judicially the interest of other railway lines, in being or planned, either in ad jacent British territory or in the terri tory of a neighbouring State or States. The Government of India, therefore, in their capacity of custodian of the other interests concerned, consider it imperative that in such cases a full enquiry should be made before assent is given to a pro ject which may prove prejudicial to the interests of other States or to the railway development of a particular area as a whole. The same principle is applied in the case of British projects which may preju dicially affect State interests. (u) Bail ways built by Indian States will be subject to the maxima and minima rates and fares prescribed by the Railway Department of the Gov ernment of India which may for the time being be in force on Indian Railways generally. {in) The Government of India recognise the prior claim of a State to construct and work a new line or extension within its own territory subject to the general provisions of sub-paragraphs I and IV above. IX. It should be understood that a survey by „ , a State of a line within Railway surveys by States. •, . •, •,•1 J J J its own territory with or without reference to the Government of India does not carry any guarantee that assent will be granted to the ultimate construction of the line.

The following are the principles to be observed in the assess- Compensation for land Illetlt compensation for land required in British India and in Indian States for railway purposes:— required for railway pur poses in Indian States and in British India. I. When land in British territory is required for the pur poses of a railway constructed or to be constructed by or at the expense of an Indian State, such land as is m private ownership will be acquired by the British revenue authorities as for a public purpose, under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. The State will be required to pay, as compensation for the land made over to it, the actual amount of the awards paid in the case of private land, and, in the case of Govern ment land, the full market value plus such incidental items of expenditure as the cost of establishment demarcation, stationery. The State will also be re quired to pay compensation for the value of extin guished land revenue, the amount to be settled bv suchNmcidental 'Hems of expenditore as the cSt of establikk*nent, demarc^ion and stationery.

Where differences of opinion occur between the State concerned and the focal revenue authorities as to the compensation pay able a Board ot Arbitration will be appointed consist ing of one member appointed by the State, another by the (lovernment of India (or by the Local Government in the case of a State which is in direct relations with a Local Government), and a third member ap pointed by mutual consent and their decision shall be final. IT. Before making an award in the case of private land in British territory to be acquired for a State, or fixing the amount of compensation in the case of Govem- ment land, the responsible officer will be required to send all necessary details, together with the estimates of the amounts payable, to the State and to give every facility for checking them to the officer or the officers concerned for the purpose, and to take into considera tion any representation which such officer or any other duly accredited representative of the Barbar may make, whether orally or by letter. Such officers or representatives should be afforded an opportunity of appearing in person or by agent and of producing evidence as to the value of the land before any award relating to it is made or the amount of compensation is fixed. III. When land is required in State territory for the purpose* of British railways proper, the general principle to be observed shall be that the same degree of compensation shall he paid to the State concerned as is payable by States under the provisions of the preceding'clauses. Where the terms of an existing contract with a 'Rail way Company provide that the Secretarv of State will use his good offices to secure the provision of land in » fate territory free of cost, the question whether com- pensation will be paid or not will be left for negotia tion between the political authorities and the State concerned. Conditions of this nature will be avoided m future contracts. In the case of land originally granted free by a State to a railway being relinquished to that State for its own railway purpose, the railway will have no15 clam, to compensation in respect of the value of such II ' to Si™ effect to these general principles, the following procedure shall be observed : In cases m which it is proposed to acquire private rights !n r and &gt;! n a a tat o for raiIway P ,ir Poses, the proceed- ^s, where the State concerned has enacted a Land Acquisition Act, will be under that law, and the pro- visions ot clause II will apply mutatis mutandis. Wheie there is no Land Acquisition Act or where the State itself owns or has rights in the land, which it is proposed to acquire, the estimates of the amount payable will be framed by the State authorities and orwarded to the Railway Administration concerned who will be afforded the facilities specified in clause or c ice xing the estimate. If such estimates are accepted by the Railway Administration, they will be treated as a settlement. Where, however, differences of opinion occur between the State authorities and the Railway Administration concerned, as to the compen sation payable, arbitration will take place. If both parties signify in writing their consent to such a course, the Political Officer concerned will he appointed as arbiter and his decision shall be final. In other cases the compensation payable shall he assessed by a Roard of Arbitration consisting of one member appointed by the State, another by the Government q , ? K ia , °r the . LocaI Government in the case of a Mate which is in direct relations with a Local Gov ernment, and a third member appointed by mutual consent, and their decision shall be final. In these latter cases the Board of Arbitration will decide the incidence of the cost of arbitration. V. In determining the amount of compensation payable, 1 ohtical Officers and other arbiters will be guided by t le general principle that the amount shall he equi valent to what would have been payable by the State md acquisition taken place in British territory and had compensation been assessed in the manner laid down in clause T supra. VI. When a railway is constructed by a State or States in British territory the State or States concerned will have precisely the same rights as any other Railwayrules are unduly high, resort will be had to arbitration in the manner provided in clause IV above. See note to clause VI. Where land outside the regular land widths, as pres cribed in Sections VII and VIII and Appendix A in the Buies for the acquisition of land for railways (enclosure to Bailway Board’s Circular No. 889-P.— 16, dated 30th August 1918), is required for tempo rary occupation, the procedure in British India will be under Part VI of the Land Acquisition Act, and in States in which a law on the same lines is in force, under that law. In cases where there is no such law, the terms of occupation and use will be settled by mutual agreement; and in case of dispute as to the terms, by arbitration in the manner prescribed in clause IV.Corrigendum to the Manual of Instructions to Officers of the Political Department, 1924. No. 87. Pages 13-16.— Substitute the following for the existing foot-note under Part VI of paragraph 21 {page 4 of corrigendum No. 12) :— Quarrying and Mining Rights. —The practice in British territory in regard to quarrying stone or excavating material required for railway purposes is as follows :— (a) On the standard strip of land ordinarily acquired by a railway administration for permanent occupation, i.e., for emplace ment of the actual railway, and its appurtenances such as station buildings, platforms, yards, workshops, etc., the question of quarrying rights or payment of royalty does not arise, inasmuch as quarrying, as such, is impracticable on such lands while material set free in the course of construc tion is utilised by the railway for its own purposes, free of royalty. For land widths ordinarily acquired for the rail- way proper (other than at stations and terminals) see para graphs 624 to 631) and Appendix III of the State Railway Code for the Engineering Department. (b) With the exception of the above title to the free use of the materials set free in the course of construction on the standard strip of land acquired for the emplacement of the railway, the acquisition of land under the Land Acquisition (Mines) Act, 1885 (XA III of 1885) carries with it only the surface rights unless the mineral rights are bought at the same t’me under the Act. Where surface rights only are acquired, a railway administration may not quarry stone outside the standard strip except with the previous consent of the owner and on payment of royalty where such is ordinarily levied. - (c) Where land is acquired under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (I of 1894), without any reservation as provided by Section 3 of the Land Acquisition (Mines) Act, 1885 (X\ III of 1885), the acquisition of land carries with it m neral rights as well. In that case, no royalty is payable by a railway administration. (d) Where Government is the owner, the mining rights are not exercised within a width of 50 yards on either side of the railway measured from the outer too of bank or outer edge of cutting. Where the mining rights are in private owner ship, the owner cannot extend any mining operations under his control at or to any point within 50 yards of a railway, except with the previous sanction of the Governor General in Council or some officer authorised by him in that behalf or otherwise than in accordance with such instructions, restrictions and conditions either general or special, which nm. be attached to such sanction [vide in this connection Section 20 of the Indian Mines Act, 1901 (VIII of 1901)].

When a Government railway or a railway worked by a Company, or by a State or States, is constructed in State territory, the general principle to be observed will be that such a railway shall enjoy the same rights as regards quarrying stone or excavating material as a railway would be entitled to in British territory,* the rates of royalty payable being determined in accordance with the rules in force in the State. In cases where there are no such rules, or where the railway authorities consider that the rates under State N 0 te. —Tire practice in British territory in regard to quarrying stone or va’ting material required for railway purposes is as follows (a) On the standard strip of land ordinarily acquired by a Bailway Admi nistration for permanent occupation, i.e., for the emplacement ot t ia actual railway, and its appurtenances such as station buildings, platforms, yards, workshops, etc., the question of quarrying rights or payment of royalty does not arise, inasmuch as quarrying as such is impracticable on such land, while material set free in the course of construction ist utilised by the railway for its own purposes, free of royalty. For * land widths ordinarily acquired for - the railway proper (other than at stations and terminals) see Sections VII and VIII and Appendix A of the Rules for acquisition of land for railways (enclosure to Railway Board s Circular No. 889-P.—16, dated the 30th August 1918). (M With the exception of the above title to the free use of materials set free in the course of cortstruction on the standard strip of land acquired for the emplacement of the railway, the acquisiition of land in general carries with it only the surface rights unless the mineral rights are bought out at the same time under the Land Acquisition (Mines) Act, 1885 (XVIII of 1885). Where surface rights only are acquired, a Railway Administration may not quarry stone outside the above standard strip except with the previous consent of the owner, and on payment of royalty where such is ordinarily levied. (c) M'ning rights other than those in respect of material met with in course of construction remain with the original owner. Where Government is the original owner, the mining rights are not exercised within a width of 50 yards on either side of the railway measured from the outer toe of bank' or outer edge of cutting. Where the mining rights are in private ownership, the owner cannot extend any mining operations under his control at or to any point within 50 yards of a railway, except with the previous sanction of the Governor-General in Council or some officer authorised by him in that behalf or otherwise than in accordance with such instructions, restrictions and conditions, either general or special, which may be attached to such sanction [vide in this connection Section 20 of the Indian Mines Act, 1901 (VIII of 1901)]. (d) When land is acquired definitely for quarrying purposed, it is open to a Railway Administration to arrange with the owner for securing the whole of the underlying minerals by payment of extra compensa tion therefor, under the provisions of the Land Acquisition (Mines) Act, 1885 (XVIII of 1885). iVorks for the purposes of, or in connection whth, a railway are detailed ally in Sections 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 51 of the Indian Railways Act, (IX of 1890).16 anti other arbiters will be guided by\the general principle \hat the am^nt shall be equivalent to what ■woulck have been ^payable ay the Durba\ had acquisition taken p\ce in British Verritory and Bad compensa tion beeki assessed in tBe manner iaid down in Vause (1) ante. \ V (6) Where lan\ is acquired aither for Durbar’s railway in Britismterritory or for a State \ilway or railway worked by a Company Vi Indian StatA territory, the compensation paid und«: the pro visions of the f&lt;\egoing clauses will be held to cover t\e right tk quarry stone and to excavate sanu, clay, earth or other ma\rial for tVe pur poses of the railwiw on th\ land so acquired without payment of royalty. 22.

When land in British territory is required by or at the. expense of an Indian State, such land as is in private ownership will be acquired by British revenue authorities as for a public purpose, under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. The State will be re quired to pay, as compensation for the land made over to it, the actual amount of the awards paid in the case of private land, and, in the case of Government land, the full market value plus such incidental items of expenditure as the cost of establishment, demarcation, stationery. The State will also be required to pay compensation for the value of extinguished land revenue, the amount to be settled by negotiation in individual cases, due re gard being had to the indirect advantages accruing to the British Government from the works, etc. In cases which involve the submergence of considerable areas, compensation for the loss of miscellaneous revenue derived from such areas may be payable in addition. Where differences of opinion occur between J - 1 - State concerned and the local revenue authorities as to the com pensation payable a Board of Arbitration will be appointed con sisting of one member appointed by the State, another by the Government of India (or by the Local Government in the case of a.

Before making an award in the ease of private land in British tei tory to be acquired for a State, or fixing the amount of compenhu- tion in the case of Government land, the responsible officer will be required to send all necessary details, together with the estimates of the amounts payable, to the State and to give every facility for checking them to the officer or the officers concerned for the purpose, and to take into consideration any representation which such officer or any other duly accredited representative of the Darbar may make, whether orally or by letter. Such officers or *Cf. Foreign and Political Department Resolution No. F. 6 (2)-R/28, dated the oth May 1930.

HI. When land is required in State territory the general principle to be observed shall be that the same degree of compensation shall be paid to the State concerned as is payable by States under the provisions of the preceding clauses. In the case of those States and Estates who under the terms of their Treaties, Sanads and any other existing contracts are bound to provide any facilities or land in their territories free of cost, the question whether com- pensation will be paid or not will be left for negotiation between the political authorities and the State concerned. IV. In order to give effect to these general principles, the following pro cedure shall be observed :— In cases in which it is proposed to acquire private rights in land in a State, the proceedings, where the State concerned has enacted a Land Acquisition Act, Will be under that law, and the provi sions of clause II will apply mutatis mutandis.^ Where there is no Land Acquisition Act or where the State itself owns or has rights in the land, which it is proposed to acquire, the estimates of the amount payable will be framed by the State authorities and forwarded to the Local Government concerned, who will be afforded the facilities specified in clause II for checking the estimate. If such estimates are accepted by the Local Govern ment, they will be treated as a settlement. Where, however, differences of opinion occur between the State authorities and the Local Government concerned, as to the compensation pay able, arbitration will take place. The compensation payable shall be assessed by a Board of Arbitration consisting of one member appointed by the State, another by the Government of India or the Local Government in the case of a State which is in direct relations with a Local Government, and a third member appointed by mutual consent, and their decision s hall be final. The Board of Arbitration will decide the incidence of the cost of arbitration. V. In determining the amount of compensation payable, theaibiteis will be guided by the general principle that the amount .shall be equivalent to what would have been payable by the State had acquisition taken place in British territory and had compensation been assessed in the manner laid down in clause I supra.

When a work is constructed by a State or States in British terri tory the State or States concerned will have precisely the same rights as authorities in charge of Government works in British territory in the matter of quarrying stone or excavating material required for the purposes of, or in connection with, the work. In cases where rates of royalty for quarrying stone and excavat- 33 in&lt;j material arc levied, resort will be had to .arbitration in the manner provided in clause IV above, in the event of agreement as to the rates payable not being reached. VJ1. When a work is constructed in State territory, the general princi ple to be observed will be that the authorities in charge of the work shall enjoy the same rights as regards rpiarrying stone or excavating material as they would be entitled to in British terri tory, the rates of royalty, if any, payable being determined in accordance with the rules in force in the State. In cases where there are no such rules, or where the authorities in charge of the work consider that the rates under Stale rules are unduly high, resort will lie had to arbitrat ion in t he manner provided in clause TV above. VIII. Where land is required for temporary occupation, the procedure in British India will bo under part VI of the Land Aecjusition Act, and in States in which a law on the same lines is in force, under that law. In cases where there is no such law. the terms of oceu- pat ion and use will be settled by mutual agreement : and in case ol dispute as to the terms, by arbitration in the manner prescribed in clause IV.

[Note 1.—Minerals dealt with by the Salt Department, sneh as salt and saltpetre, are excluded from consideration in this connection.] [Note 2.—It is possible that in future the development of scientifio knowledge may make it desirable to transfer particular miaerals from one group to the other.] II. The Government of India invite States in the interests of the Empire and their own interests, (a) in dealing with “ essential ” minerals to adopt the general policy embodied in the Government of India rules for the grant of prospecting licences and min ing leases ; (b) in respect of all minerals to impose such restrictions regarding the nationality of concessionaires as may be imposed in British India. III. The principal features of the policy of the Government of India, which they consider it ex pedient that Indian States should follow in respect of “essential*’ minerals, areas follows:— (1) Prospecting licences should be granted for short periods only, viz., for one year renewable for a further term of two years. The Government of India are considering whether the period of a prospecting licence for petroleum should M1FD c18 not be extended, if good reasons exist, up to five years. (2) Mining leases should be granted for long periods, but not exceeding 30 years, with option of renewal for a further period of 30 years. In case of renewal the State retains the right of revising the rate of royalty. (3) The maximum area granted in any State under a mining lease to any individual lessee or others joint in interest should be 10 square miles. (4) In granting concessions States should, in the interests of the Empire and in their own interests, reserve the right of pre-emption of the output of minerals. (5) No concessions should be granted to a person, other than a subject of the State concerned, who does not hold a certificate of approval from the Gov ernment of India or a local Govern ment or the Indian State of which he is a subject, and every transfer or assignment of a concession or any interest thereunder should be made only (1) to a person holding a certificate of approval from the Government of India or a local Government or the Indian State of which he is a subject, or (2) to a subject of the State concerned. IV. As regards non-essential minerals, while States would be well advised in their own interests to follow the same policy as in the case of the essential minerals, the chief points on which the Government of India lay stress is that the co-operation of States should be invited in refusing concessions to persons whose nationality, under such restrictions as may be imposed from time to time in British India, would debar them from sect-! ing a concession in British jndia.19 V. At present foreigners are debarred from securing mining concessions in British India. Any change of policy in this respect will be communicated to the Durbars. VI. Draft rules for the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in Indian States modelled on the rules of the Government of India are published for the information of the Durbars. {Vide Appen dix XVII). It is desirable that the rules formulated by Durbars should always include the provisions specified in paragraph III above relating to “ essential minerals.”20 CHAPTER III. For. &amp; Pol. Deptt. Resolution No. 242*1., dated 6th Deo. 1923. Telegraphs and Telephones. 23 I. The following are the principles regarding Construction and mainten- telegraph systems, indud- ance of telegraph systems in ing tram control Wires DUt Indian States. excluding wireless systems, in Indian States:—* (t) The maintenance of a unitary telegraph system throughout India is a matter of Imperial importance and it is advisable that the construction and maintenance of the system should be under the direct control of the Indian Posts and Tele graphs Department. (ii) The right of States to share in the profits of the system within their respective territories on an equitable basis, to be mutually discussed hereafter, is recognised. (iii) The right of a State to construct, maintain and work its own independent telegraph system for internal purposes for gain or otherwise, wholly within its own boun daries and not connected with the Imperial system, is recognised. Where a State desires to extend its own system beyond its own boundaries the previous consent of the Government of India will be neces sary and, if such an extension is to nter the territories of another State, the previous consent of that State will also be necessary. Where a State desires to connect its system to an Imperial telegraph Office, the previous consent of the Government of India will be required and the Govern ment of India will lay down such con- ditions regarding exchange of traffic as it may deem necessary. ( v) On account of the importance in Imperial interests of maintaining a complete record of all existing systems, it is necessary that sketch maps of all such independenttele- graph systems and subsequent additions21 thereto should be sent to the Govern ment of India for the information of the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Depart ment. It would be convenient for impor tant additions or alterations to be intimat ed as soon as possible. (v) The consent of the Government of India to the construction of a railway to be owned and worked by a State includes consent to the construction of a telegraph system for purely railway purposes. Should a State desire to open such a Railway tele graph system to the public, arrangements should be made in consultation with the Government of India as provided in the next clause. (ri) After previous consultation with the Government of India, Railway telegraph systems along railways owned and worked by g, State may be opened to public traffic and worked by the State subject to the following conditions - (a) that such telegraph wires and apparatus as are supplied to and maintained in the State by the Indian Posts and Tele graphs Department will be supplied and maintained on the same terms as may from time to time be in force in the case of telegraph wires and apparatus supplied to and maintained by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Depart ment for Government railways. (b) that the State works the offices in strict accordance with the rules from time to time authorised for the working of Licen sed Telegraph Systems in British India : Provided that where such a railway lies exclusively within the territories of an Indian State, a telegraph system constructed along such railway and not connected with any Imperial office is not affected by the provisions of this sub-clause.22 vii) The States recognise that on the occurr ence of a grave public emergency, or in the interests of the public safety, the Gov ernor-General in Council may, as a tem porary measure and subject to reasonable provision being made for State business— (a) take control of any telegraph systems or part of any telegraph systems to which these principles apply, or (b) direct that any messages or class of mes - sages to or from any persons or class of persons, or relating to any particular • subject brought for transmission by, o r transmitted, or received by, any tele graph shall not be transmitted or shall be intercepted or detained, or shall be dis closed to the Government or an officer thereof mentioned in the order. The powers of the Governor General in Coun cil may be exercised by the Governors of Provinces in regard to States which are in political relations with them. If any doubt arises as to the existence of a grave public emergency or whether any act done under (a) and (b) above was in the interest of the public safety, a certificate signed by the Political Secretary to the Government of India or a Secretary to a Local Gov ernment, as the case may be, will be conclusive proof on the point. II. Whenever it is proposed by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department to establish a new Imperial telegraph office in an Indian State, the Postmaster-General should address the Political Officer concerned direct in order to ascertain the views of the State on the project In the event of a State disagreeing with a proposal the views of the State will be forwarded to the Foreign and Political Depart ment of the Government of India, and the proposal will not be pressed except for strategic or other exception ally important reasons. When the proposal for the es tablishment of such an office emanates from a State23 the Political Officer will address the Postmaster- General. The establishment of a new Imperial office in an Indian State with the consent of the State will not require a previous reference to the Government of India. III. Inland telegrams sent over the Imperial Telegraph and Licensed Telegraph Systems on official business of Indian States will be accepted and trans mitted throughout India as Raj telegrams, but, as in the case of Inland State messages as defined in the Indian Post and Telegraph Guide, they will not be allowed priority over private messages of the same class. The charges must be paid for in Service stamps • or in cash or on the deposit account system, as laid down in the Rules in the Post and Telegraph Guide. IV. All Raj telegrams, to whomsoever addressed? and all private telegrams addressed to Rulers or officials of Ind’an States by official designation only, will be redirected to any part of India by telegraph free of charge according to the provisions of the Indian Post and Telegraph Guide. V. Telegraphic abbreviated addresses for Ruling Princes and officials of Indian States will, if required, be recognised and registered without registration fee. Application for such registration should be addressed to the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, Traffic Branch, Calcutta. VI. (i) Ruling Princes vdio are members of the Chamber of Princes in their own right and their ministers have the privilege of sending Clear the Line messages between telegraph offices withimtheir own territories. (li) Ruling Princes who are members of the Chamber of Princes in their own right have the privilege of sending Clear the Line messages to addressees outside their State territories, subject to the following conditions — (a) that the privilege is exercised only on the occasion of a grave emergency arising in or affecting the State and during such emergency ; (b) that it is personal to the Ruler himself ;24 (c) that it is confined to telegrams addressed to the Viceroy, the Governor of any Province, the Political Secretary, a Local Government or a local Political Officer. (lii) A Ruler who is a member of the Chamber of Princes in his own right may, when absent from his State in India, send from any telegraph office in India on the occasion of any grave public emergency affect ing his State, a Clear the Line message to— {a) his Chief or Senior Minister, and (b) any of the addressees mentioned in clause (u) (c). (iv) In the absence of a Ruler from his State the Chief or Senior Minister is authorised to send Clear the Line messages on an occasion of grave public emergency to the Ruler himself when the Ruler is in India, or to any of the addressees mentioned in clause (ii) (c). The Ruler who receives a Clear the Line message in such circumstances may Clear the Line in reply. VII. (i) Ruling Princes who are members of the Chamber of Princes in their own right and their ministers are entitled to mark their messages “ Prio rity ” in matters of urgency within the limits of their own States. (ii) In periods of unusual congestion the Govern * ment of India are prepared to authorize Ruling Princes and their senior ministers specially affected to mark messages “ Priority” for any part of India as a temporary measure. The chief telegraph officer in a State will be instructed to inform the senior Minister of the existence of unusual congestion. 24. Until the g Wireless telegraphic installat in Indian States. State-owned sets :— (!) («) case Permissi set out i commun Foreign24. Establishment, maintenance and working of ivireless telegraphs and wire less telephones in Indian States. —The following are the principles to be observed in regard to the establishment, maintenance and working of wireless telegraphs and wireless telephones in Indian States :— I. Wireless stations whether owned by a State or licensed by a State, reqtnfed solely for communication within a State—It is essential, with a view to maintain co-ordination and to avoid mutual interference, that there should be previous consultation with the Government of India in regard to installation and power and before any alterations in location (in the case of fixed sets), type and power are introduced. For this purpose information* is required as to the following points :— (а) the general purpose for which the station is required (e.g., whether it is required for public or private communications, for experi mental or instructional purposes, and whether it is to be fixed or portable, permanent or temporary), (б) the distance over which communication is desired, (c) in the case of a fixed station, the approximate location, i.e., town, vil lage, etc. II. Wireless stations, whether owned by a State or licensed by a State, required for communication with a station in British India.—Such stations can only be erected and worked under special arrangements with the Government of I ndia and the conditions {e.g., in regard to times of working, traffic and rates) will be regulated according to the circumstances of each case. III. Wireless stations, whether owned by a State or licensed by a State, required for communication with a station in another State .—Such stations can only be erected and worked under mutual arrangements effected between the States concerned through the Government of India. IV. The following are the conditions generally applicable to all wireless stations in British India and in Indian States : {a) Qualified operators should be employed whenever a transmitting set is operated, except in the case of a wireless telehpone set of 30 Note to Clause T— After receiving this information the Government of India will, having regaid to the location, be in a position to advise in respect of the tvpe of installa tion required and the power necessary, and to allot suitable waves to eacli station Unless such advice is obtained and followed there is a risk that stations might be erected in totallv unsuitable situations or that the apparatus might be quite inadequate focthe purpose in view. In either case the station would probably prove to be a failure. On the other hand, too powerful a station might be erected involving unnecessary expenditure and pro bably causing undesirable interference with other stations. The Indian Mates will have full scope for choice as regards the type of installations In respect of wave-lengths and the extent of the power of the sets employed their wishes will be met as far as possible. %suspension of working temporarily ”, “ adjustment of wave and power, etc.), when made by Indian Government Stations. Such signals will only be made on the authority of the Director of Wireless. (ff) The power employed in a wireless station in an Indian State should be limited to that required adequately to provide the communica tion intended from time to time. (e) In the case of public emergency (see Appendix, Note 2) it is neces sary for the British Government and the States to work in close co-operation, and the Imperial Government feel confident that they may rely on the Indian States to co-operate with them. V. Since the responsibility will rest with the States for the working of wireless telegraphs and telephones within their territories, whether worked by the states or under licenses granted by the States, it is desirable that the purely technical terms of the licenses granted by the States should be similar to the terms of the licenses granted in British India. Other terms, of an administrative nature, relating to fees, powers to ins pect, powers to take over, penalties, etc., will be at the discretion of the States. VI. The Government of India are prepared, when desired, to advise on all matters concerning the design, siting and erection of stations. They are pre pared, on payment of cost, if accommodation and staff are available, to train supervising and operating staff and to specify, and order and, if necessary staff is available, to undertake erection of apparatus and plant. It would be advant ageous both to the Government of India and to States if the Director of Wire less and his Gazetted Officers could be permitted to visit wireless stations in the States, and similar visits to the wireless stations in British India could be arranged for the wireless officers of the States. VII. The principles of this Resolution are liable to revision in the light of subsequent experience. * Note I to Clause IV (a).—The question of Indian States granting certificates is reserved for further consideration. Note II to Clause IV (a).—A qualified operator is essential for the following reasons :— (») Unless jje is technically qualified he will not know whether his apparatus is in correct working order or not, and will not be able to detect or remedy any faults arising from time to time. Technical qualifications are particularly necessary with the complicated apparatus employed now-a-days. (w) Unless he is qualified in operating duties he will be unable to understand the working of other stations or to operate his own station correctly, with the result that he will not handle traffic efficiently, if at all and in his efforts to obtain communication he may unknowingly cause great interference to other stations.^iiairtuociiaoicjs ui witve eimtteu, (d) waves to be used, (e) interference, • (/) standards of qualification of operators, (g) operating procedure. Note 2.— There are strong technical reasons for requiring a stricter degree of control in time of grave public emergency, viz. :— (а) A station might be required as a linking Station between two Stations in British India separated by the State in question and normally out of range of each other. (б) It might be desirable to organise the Stations of separate but ad jacent States or the Stations of one State into a group to provide telegraph facilities for the Government of India. (c) The control of traffic might be desirable so as to obtain some of the benefits of {a) and (6) without actually working the Stations. (d) Stations might be of great value for intercepting enemy traffic, watch ing for illicit Stations and general intelligence work in time both of internal trouble and of war, which the Government of India might not have foreseen. (e) If a State in which there is unrest desires communication with a Station in British India it may be advantageous to the State to ask the Government of India for assistance in operating the State Station.

When a State desires to extend its own system beyond its own boundaries, the previous consent of the Government of India will be necessary, and, if such an extension is to enter the territories of another State, the previous consent of that State will also be necessary.ADDENDA TO “ MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFICERS OF THE POLITICAL DEPARTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA* 1924”. No. 55. 1. Page 26.—The following shall be added as paragraph 25-A. : *t 25 .A. Radio Broadcasting in Indian, Stales .—The following principles shall be observed in regard to radio broadcasting in Indian States 1 Indian States are entitled to grant their own Broadcast Receiver licenses witnin their re&amp;pective territories. It is, however, de sirable that the procedure and conditions applicable to Biuish India should be observed with such modincations as may be found necessary. 2 The annual fee to be charged for a Broadcast Receiver license should be the same in Indian States as in British India ; the present rate in British India is Rs. 10 per license. 3 Each State should collect the broadcasting receiver license fees for stations within its own territory aud would have no claim to a share of similar license fees for stations outside its own territory, but the collecting authority would of course be free to pay any share of the fees collected to any broadcasting agency, whether inside or outside its territory, wuich dues in tact pro vide a broadcasting service to stations witnin that territory. 4 Indian States should bo free to establish broadcast transmitting stations within their respective territories but for the reasons explained in the Resolution of the Government of India in tne Foreign and Political Department, No. 4y6-i., dated the 27th May i920, the Government of India should hist be consulted and the provisions contained in that Resolution should be observed. 5 The Government of India invite Darbars alike in the interests of the Empire and their own interests to introduce such general piin* ciples oi censorship as may from time to time be imposed in British India. At present in British India nothing can bo broadcasted which offends against public morals or is of seditious tendency or is likely to arouse racial, religious or communal animosity, or contains statements on topics of political or industrial contro versy. Instructions have been issued to the autnorities con cerned with censorship in British India to the effect that the term *' seditious ” is to be understood as including matter offending against States in India. 6 With regard to the importation of Radio-apparatus through the port of an Indian State, the Government of India would be clad if the Darbar concerned would levy customs duty tnereon at rates not lower than those in force at ports in British India. It is also considered desirable that persons wishing to import wireless apparatus into an Indian State should be re quired by the Darbar concerned to enter into an undertaking tnat the apparatus thus imported will not be taken into Bausn India except under license from the Government oi India. 2 7.

The full and unrestricted permission by Warrant under the Royal Sign-Manual is designed to meet cases where the Decoration may be said to hav^been earned by some valuable service render ed toYhe Head of the State conferring it, or to the State i\self. Application will be made to His Majesty for fullVermission by His Majesty’s Principal Secre tary of Mate for Foreign Affairs on behalf of any person whV not being at the time in the Service of the Crown, is idther in the salaried employment of a Foreign Stat\ or has rendered valuable services within the period ofNPwo years immediately preceding the notification oK the Decoration to His Majesty’s Government as Wescribed under Rule 5. The expression “ valuable services ” must be construed as meaning some service rendered to a Foreign Head of Smte or Government specifically, and must be indisputably valuable in the strict sense of the word. Though such services need not necessarily be gratuitous, as in the case of a person actually in the employ\of a Foreign Government, they must be unconnected with any transaction of a commercial or financial Vharacter brought about in the ordinary course o\ business. The term “ valuable services ” does notVtherefore, as a general rule, apply to services connected with the fulfilment of Government, or Municipal contracts, the financ ing of Government or Municipal Vans. It also does not include the presentation of objects of value to Public Museums and Institutions, pecuniary dona tions or endowments, personal performances, ser vices in connection with Exhibition^ and Indus trial Congresses, services in the domain of art, literature, science, education and agriculVire, services rendered by British subjects in the capacity of hono rary foreign Consular Officers. \ Red Cross and kindred services will mily be regarded as “valuable” for the purposes o\ these Regulations when they have been rendered in V war in which the Empire has itself been engagedVmd when the Decoration for the wearing of which per mission is sought has been conferred by an Allied State. '.i33 4. .Kestricted permission is contemplated for Decorations which have been conferred in recognitioi of personal attention to the Head of a Foreign StaFe or Member of a Reigning House, and which are there fore of a more or less complimentary character. Restricted permission is as a rule only giv^ on exceptional occasions, when in the public inxerest and for political reasons it is deemed expedient that the acceptance of a Foreign Decoration shoujid not be declined. 5. Both in the case of full and in that of restricted permission the matter will be submitted/xo the King by His Majesty’s Principal Secretarw^bf State for Foreign Affairs. fr The desire of the Head of a Foreign State to confer upon a British subject thp Insignia of an Order, or the fact that he has done so, must be notified to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs either/through the British Diplomatic Representative accredited to the Head of the Foreign State, or through the Diplomatic Representative of the latte© at the Court of St. James. His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shall bjc under no obligation to consider claims that areAot brought to his notice through one of these channels. 6. When His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shall have taken the King’s pleasure on any such application, and shall have obtained His Maje/ry’s permission for the person in whose favour it b&amp;s been made to wear the Insignia of a Foreign Ordot, he shall signify the same to His Majesty’s Princiwhl Secretary of State for the Home Department, inAnder that he may cause a Warrant, if it be a case for the issue of a Warrant as defined in Rule 2, to be ^prepared for the Royal Sign-Manual. When sifth Warrant shall have been signed by the King, / notification thereof shall be inserted in the £t Garotte,” stating the service for which the Foreign 0rder has been conferred. Pensons in whose favour such Warrants are issued will be required to pay to His Majesty’s Principal M1FD eI Department a stamp ; His Majesty’s per- id at the expense of , be registered in the Warrant as aforesaid g that His Majesty’s authorise the assump- rank, precedence, or light Bachelor of His as received the Rcyal a accept and wear the he will not be allov ed , higher class of the esty’s approval.

Medals. \ 10. Medals, with the exceptions specified below, are subject to the Regulations in the j$ame manner as Orders, but permission to wear is by letter and not by Royal Warrant. No permission is needed to accept a Foreign Medal if it is not to be worn. 11. Medals for saving or attempting to save life at sea or on land conferred on behalf of the Head or Government of a Foreign State, may be accepted and worn without His Majesty’s special permissionA 12. In the case of Medals for Red Cross services permission will only be granted in the conditions lajd down in Rule 3, paragraph 3 above.35 13.

This rule will apply in the case of Civil Officers also, and no official list published in India should show any Civil Officers as entitled to wear a Foreign Order unless the conditions stated above have been fulfilled. In every case where full permission has not been gazetted it is intended that officers shall receive restricted permission to wear their decorations. 29. In accordance with His Majesty’s command CA.

As these high titles are given very sparingly for exceptionally meritorious service and only to persons of good family who are in a position suitably to maintain them, the follow ing qualifications are regarded as essential:— (a) the possession of considerable landed property ; (b) unimpeachable fidelity to Government; and (c) respectable private character. 5. In connection with recommendations for the higher title specified in rule 4, the estimated annual income of the person reccmmended should be stated. Where possible it is desirable that references to gazetteers, etc., showing the status of the family, should be given. 6. When recommendations are made for here ditary titles, it should be reported whether the urle of succession or inheritance in the family is such as to ensure an adequate endowment of the title ; it should also be stated how many sons the person recom mended has. 7. As a rule recommendations should be made in the first instance for the titles of Sardar Sahib, Khan Sahib, Rai Sahib and Rao Sahib ; but in cases of unusual services, or where -these titles would be inappropriate on account of the rank or status of the recipient, recommendations may be made for the grant of the titles of Diwan Bahadur, Sardar Bahadur, Khan Bahadur, Rai Bahadur and Rao Bahadur, in the first instance : such recommendations should, however, invariably be accompanied with an explanation of the reasons why the former lower title is considered inadequate. In submitting recommendations for the Baha dur and the Sahib tides, a ratio of approximately 2 : 3- should normally be maintained.8. In the case of a recipient of a lower title being recommended for a higher title the date on which the lower title was granted must always be stated. 9. In order to safeguard the prestige of Indian titles the social status of persons recommended and the nature of the services rendered by them should always be taken into consideration. This applies with special force to the Bahadur titles, particularly Diwan Bahadur and Sardar Baha dur. ? The title of Sardar Bahadur, it will be remem bered, is one which is given to members of the Order of British India, 1st Class, a fact which makes it important to maintain its reputation. Persons engaged in purely clerical work on salaries of less than Bs. 250 per month should not be recom mended except in very special circumstances, and in all cases where persons holding clerical appointments are recommended for Indian titles, the salary at tached to such appointments should always be stated in the recommendation. 10. The names, titles and designations of the persons recommended, and, in the case of officials, the branch of the service to which they belong and the offices which they hold, if these are to be gazet ted must be stated in the exact form in which they are intended to appear in the Gazette of India, and in the sanads which are granted to the title-holders. These details should be given in the column headed “ Name and designation of ‘person recommend ed The father’s name (unless it is a part of che name as in the case of some Persian and Sindhi names) should not be stated in this column. The prefix ‘ Doctor ’ should not be used unless the person concerned actually holds the Degree of Doctor of a recognized University. 11. A specific title must always be proposed, 12. There is ordinarily no objection to the re newal of previous recommendations, and it should be borne in mind that previous recommendations are not considered unless expressly renewed. In the event of the renewal of a previous recommendation40 the date on which such a recommendation was made must always be given. rJX. ^an PoL i • or( ^ er to lessen the possibility of titles mentNo. 317-LC,, refused after conferment, discreet enquiries dated the 29 th s hould be made beforehand, in doubtful cases, as to January 1918. the willingness of the individual concerned to accept a mark of favour from Government. 14. The Province or State of which the person recommended is a native must be mentioned. _ c/. For. and Pol. 15. Whenever it is nronosed to reenmmpnd a 1915. outside his own Province, the Plead of the Province to which he belongs should he consulted before any recommendation is submitted. The Head of the Province thus consulted is at liberty to express an opinion freely on the merits of the recommendation, and his opinion should invari ably be entered by the recommending authority at the end of the column headed ‘ ’ Grounds of recommend ation as stated by the local authority ” )ept. 16. Before any subject or official of a Darba r 12 th ] s recommended for an Indian title, the wishes of the Puling Prince or Chief should, as a rule, be ascertained informally and privately unless in anv particular case special reasons exist to the contrary. It is especially desirable that this procedure should be followed when the title which it is proposed to grant would confer upon the recipient any apparent official rank in the State. 17. Recommendations for the grant of Literary and Medical titles should be submitted in duplicate in the attached form for lower titles.

Te con ferred upon scholars of emi nent distinction in the traditional learning; though 1912. those who have qualified both in that and also subse quently in modern courses would also be suitable recipients. Recommendations for these titles must be accompanied by a clear statement upon the follow ing points :— (a) It must be clearly shown that the proposed recipient of the honour is a scholar in the42 medical men of distinction, who have rendered emi nent services to the native schools of medicine. The first named will be given very sparingly and only to persons of exceptional distinction and influence. 21. As a rule, no person should be recommended for a British honour as well as for an Indian title at the same time. In the event of a double recom mendation being made, the fact should be clearly stated in each of the recommendations. Cf. For. Dept. Cir. No. 753-L, dated 8th Feb. 1889. 32. All Ruling Princes and Chiefs who are entitled rr .! r«« tt- t. „ to a salute of not less than Title of Highness. , . , i • ten guns enjoy the pri vilege of being addressed by the title “ Highness.” As a matter of courtesy the principal wives or widows of all who bear or have borne the title of “ Highness ” may also be addressed by that title. 33.

Any salute fired during the ceremony, to celebrate the completion of the installation, should be that of the Ruling Prince or Chief himself, fired in his honour and limited to the number of guns con stituting his dynastic local or personal salute. A Royal salute should not be fired at these cere monies except on the following occasions :— (1) When the Viceroy is present in person and then only on the arrival and departure of43 His Excellency as the salute to which the Viceroy is entitled ; (2) When, in the absence of the Viceroy, a kharita from His Excellency to the Ruling Prince or Chief is produced at the Durbar. If any member of the British Royal Family is expected to be present at an installation ceremony, the question of the salutes to be fired should be refer red for special orders.

The National Anthem^th Oct.^ois!^ 6 should therefore be played for Governors on all official occasions, when they are wearing the King's uniform. Such official occasions include Levees, State Balls, Investitures, Receptions of and Visits to Ruling Princes and Chiefs and Military Parades includ ing the presentation of Colours or Medals, when the Governor is in uniform. The exceptions to this rule are- (1) The National Anthem is not played for the Governor when the Viceroy is in the Governor’s Presidency. (2) At the Proclamation Parade and King’s Birthday Parade the Governor would not take the salute since the National Anthem and Royal Salute are then given for the King-Emperor and the Pro clamation. i44 Cir^NM 0r 777 D 778- ^ 0 ^ 0W ^ n g rules should be observed in LB., dated 20th proposing the King’s April 1910 .

Under orders issued on the 19th March 1895 it was laid down that when, Ceremonial reception of Ruling w jthout giving offence, it is possible in arranging tne ceremonial reception (peshwai) of a Ruling Prince or Chief to dispense with the attendance of officers in military employ, this should be done, a suitable ex planation being offered to the Ruling Prince or Chief, if necessary. When offence would be given if officers in military employ did not attend, practice should follow precedents for the lifetime cf the Prince or Chief then ruling, and the matter should be report ed for orders on the occasion of the next succession. In no case should the Commanding Officer be request ed to go beyond the limits of the Cantonment to meet the Ruling Prince or Chief, unless indeed the cantonment Railway Station happens to be outside those limits; nor should the Commanding Officer be asked to go at all unless the hour appointed for the Ruling Prince’s or Chief’s arrival is a reasonably convenient one.45 The Government of India attach importance to cj. letters to the maintenance of ceremonial in accordance with A 8 ents 40 the ancient customs and to a strict adherence to etiquette ^Ra^uUnT^nd on ceremonial occasions.

Attempts will also be made to secure a similar privilege in foreign countries where the foreign power concerned is willing tu grant it. (3) The Government of India will not, how ever, be in a position to move in the matter unless detailed information in regard to the Ruler’s journey is supplied to them in sufficient time prior to his departure to comply with the formalities necessary in these cases.

He shall at the outset submit in outline to the Political Secretary a programme of his arrangements, with a rough estimate of probable expenses to be disbursed by or through him, and he shall from time to time report any alterations he may make in his programme. He shall, unless otherwise directed in writing, once a month, or, if the visit lasts less than a month, at the close of his visit, submit to the Political Secre tary at the India Office for examination accounts of all expenditure incurred by or through him in connection with his deputation, furnishing vouchers wherever possible. ^Arrangements for the accommodation of the Ruling Princ^or Chief or of the Political Officer in attendance, or of both', may be undertaken by the India Office, should the Secretary of State consider this course to be desirable.

The Political Officer or the guardian in charge of a young Prince or Chief while in Europe for educational or similar purposes is responsible to the Secretary of State alone as regards all matters connected with his management, and must submit to the Secretary of State through the Political Aide-de-Camp all pro posals requiring the sanction of higher authority and keep him fully and punctually informed through the same channel of all arrangements con templated.

If no intimation is given, it will be understood that the Rfiling Prince or Chief desires to remain incognito. ( 2 ) Formal visits .—In the case of all formal visits, where ceremonial is involved, the Government of India consider it desirable that at least a week s previous notice should be given to the Local Gov ernment or Administration, to whose jurisdiction it is proposed to pay the visit.42. ( 1 ) Hill Stations other than Simla. —In view Vi.it, to Hill station.. of the short«ge of accom- modation at the Ml sta tions mentioned below, the Government of India consider it essential that visits to these stations should be arranged in prior consultation with the Tocal Governments in whose jurisdiction these sta tions are situated. Sufficient previous notice should be given to the Local Government concerned which should not ordinarily be less than 15 days from the receipt by the latter of intimation of a desire to visit the station by the Prince or Chief concerned. The stations concerned are :— ( 1 ) Assam .. Shillong. ( 2 ) Bengal .. Darjeeling. (3) Central Provinces Pachmarhi. (4) Madras .. Any station in the Nil giri or Palni Hills. (5) Punjab .. Murree, Dalhousie, and Dharamsala. ( 6 ) United Provinces Mussoorie, Landour, Lansdowne, V / (7) Bombay Naini Tal, Almora, and Ranikhet. Mahableshwar, and Matheran. Such prior consultation may be dispensed with in any case in which a Ruling Prince or Chief is the ow ner of a house or houses in the hill station : but e\ cn in this case as a matter of convenience and c&lt; urtesy prior intimation of such visits is desirable. As regards Bhowali and Lotani see para. 44 infra.52 - 767*4/33) ( 2 ) Fwi7.9 to Simla .—Special considerations ope rate in the case of visits to Simla and the previous consent of the Government of India should be ob tained when a Ruling Prince or Chief wishes to visit Simla. The Government of India desire to receive the earliest possible intimation of such visits and in addition to be supplied with information re garding the object and approximate duration or the visit, the place of residence, the names of any near relatives (other than ladies) or of high officials of the State accompanying the Ruler and the number of the retinue. This procedure does not apply to the Rulers of the Simla Hill States in Political, relation with the Superintendent, Simla Hill States**-^ *^ **7^ n&gt; 43. In the case of Dt Visits to Delhi. Ihi special considerations make it desirable that the Government of India should receive early intimation of the proposed visit of any Ruling Prince or Chief to Delhi, while the Government of India are in residence there, even though the visit may be private and the Ruler may not propose to ask for an interview with His Rxcel- lencv the Yicerov. 44 . (a) The Government of India trust that Ruling Princes and Chiefs General matters applicable to visiting places in British allvl8lt3 - India will observe the following conditions :— ( 1 ) That the Ruler will enforce on his entour age respect for municipal regulations. ( 2 ) That the number of followers accompanying the Ruler, when in residence, will be re asonable and not in excess of that for which the local authority considers that • accommodation is available. (3) That on the occasions of the Ruler s visits he will depute an officer on his behalf to consult the local Sanitary or Health53 authority as regards sanitary require ments and carry out his advice in the matter. (b) The above does not relate to hill stations not now existing but which may be established hereafter in the jurisdiction of Local Governments. The local circumstances of such hill stations will require special examination in each case; and special directions regarding them will be issued, in those cases, where, after consultation with the Local Government, it appears necessary to the Government of India to do so. In accordance with paragraph 47 ( 6 ) above, t ^ or ] Re * lu ^Qn case of the hill station of Bhowali, and the adjoiningN^ueo—^s-H., sanatorium of Lq^ani in the United Provinces has dated the 19th now been considered by the Government of India Ma y 1923&lt; in consultation with the Government of the United Provinces. It has been arranged that Bhowali and Lotani will be included in the list of hill stations in paragraph 45 ( 6 ) referred to above, but when urgent medical reasons render delay undesirable there will be no objection to Ruling Princes and Chiefs proceeding to Bhowali and Lotani without prior consultation with the Local Government. 45.

Majesty the King-Emperor will be conveyed by an exchange of kha itas of a complimentary character between the new Prince or Chief and the Viceroy or other high authority con cerned. The kharita from the Viceroy (or head of the Local Government, as the case may be) will be presented to the new Prince or Chief by a representa tive of the British Government at a formal visit. 2 . In the case of successions other than those of the direct natural heir, the announcement or recog nition and confirmation will be made by a representa tive of the British Government either at a Darbar held for the purpose or, if this is the custom of the State, at a formal visit to the Prince or Chief. 3 . It is desirable that the local and religious cere monies of Installation should, in the case of disputed successions, be deferred until the orders of Government on the question of succession have been obtained. The pertorTrance of such ceremonies can in no case affect the prerogative of the Paramount Power in dealing with disputed successions.56 4. The Darbar referred to in paragraph 2 will be considered as held by the Prince or Chief, the Repre sentative of the British Government sitting at his right hand. 5. Owing to the diversity of local customs, no definite instructions can be formulated regarding the procedure to be followed at such Darbars, but where a Darbar is held the main outlines are as follows (a) The Representative of the British Govern ment formally announces the recognition of the succession on behalf of the King- Emperor and presents the Jcharita, if there be one, from His Excellency the Viceroy or the Head of the Local Government or Administration. (b) He also conducts the Prince or Chief to the gadi or masnad, if this is in accordance with the custom of the State. (c) In cases where it is customary, he fastens on a sirpech or sword or both and places a necklace round the neck of the Prince or Chief. Sometimes he also attires the Prince or Chief with a robe. (d) A khilat is presented in cases where it is cus tomary and peshkash is received in return. 6 . The installation of a Prince or Chief, who is of full age carries with it proprio vigore his investiture with ruling powers, unless Government see fit to restrict by special order the exercise of such powers. Government will decide in each case when a Prince or Chief is to be regarded as having attained full age. 7 . If a Prince or Chief is a minor at the time of his Installation, the termination of his minority and his investiture with ruling powers, when approved, will be announced by a Representative of the British Govern ment at an Investiture Darbar, which will be regarded as held by the Prince or Chief, the British Representa tive sitting at his right hand. The ceremonies will include the reading by the British Representative of the kharita, if there be one, from the Viceroy or other high authority and its presentation to the Prince57 ST, or Chief. It is not desirable to repeat at the Investi ture Darbar the ceremonies mentioned in paragraph 5 ( 6 ), (c) and (d) above. 8 . Lesser details of procedure must be settled in each case, whether of Installation or Investiture, with regard to precedent and local custom and feeling, reference being made to the Government of India on any doubtful point. 9. The above instructions apply primarily to States having a salute of guns. In other cases it is left to Local Governments and Administrations to decide, with due regard to existing practice, how far the instructions should be considered applicable. 52. The Government of India have for some time F or . &amp; p 0 ]. Dept. past devoted Special COnsi- Resolution No. Minority Administration in t n thp miPdfion of 1 894-LA., dated Indian States. aeration to tne question oi mh m7 the principles which should be observed in connection with the administration of an Indian State during a minority. The opinion of certain Ruling Princes and Chiefs and of Political Officers were obtained by the Government of India during Lord Hardinge’s Viceroyalty and the question in some of its aspects came under discus sion at the Conference of Ruling Princes and Chiefs recently held at Delhi. The Governor-General in Council, after full consideration of the views elicited, has, with the approval of the Secretary of State, decided that the policy of Government in the matter may appropriately be stated as follows :— The Government of India recognise that they are the trustees and custodians of the rights, inter ests and traditions of Indian States during a minority administration. Their general policy is laid down in the following extract from certain orders, wffiich were issued some y ears ago for the guidance of Politi cal Officers :— “ The Governor-General in Council is opposed to anything like pressure on Darbars to introduce British methods of administra tion. He prefers that reforms should MlFD H58 emanate from the Darbar, and grow up in harmony with the traditions of the State. Administrative efficiency is at no time the only or indeed the chief object to be kept in view. This should specially be borne in mind by officers charged temporarily with the administration of a State during a minority, whether they are • in sole charge, or associated with a State Council. They occupy a position of peculiar trust, and should never forget that their primary duty is the conserva tion of the customs of the State. Abuses and corruption should be corrected as far as possible, but the general system of administration to which the Chief and the people have become accustomed should be unchanged in all essentials. The methods sanctioned by tradition in States are generally well adapted tc the needs and relations of the Ruler and people. The loyalty of the latter to the former is generally a personal loyalty, which ad ministrative efficiency, if carried out on lines unsuited to local conditions, would lessen or impair.” The Government of India realise that the special conditions of each State require special treatment and will be glad to receive and consider requests by individual Princes or Chiefs regarding any princi ples which they may wish to be adopted in the case of their own States or families. Due weight will be attached to wishes so expressed or to any written or verbal instructions left on record, but the Govern ment of India on whom the find responsibility rests must reserve to themselves full freedom of action in dealing with such requests or instructions. Subject to the foregoing observations, the Governor-General in Council is pleased to lay down the following general principles for the conduct of minority ad ministrations. The announcement is subject to the reservation that the principles laid down will be liable to relaxation in individual cases where59 •special conditions may render their strict application inappropriate :— Principles to be observed during minority adminis trations. ( 1 ) The administration of a State during a minority should ordinarily be entrusted to a Council. In cases where the appointment of a Regent is in acordance with the custom of the State and a suitable person is available for nomination as Regent the Council should be styled a “ Council of Regency,” and should consist of three to five Indian Members under the presidency of the Regent. The Regent may be either a legitimate mother or widow or a near male relative of the late Ruler, provided that the latter was in the full confidence of the late Ruler at the time of his demise. Where no Regent is available, the Council should be styled a “ Council of Administration,” and should consist of three to five Indian Members presided over by an Indian administrator of proved experience of Indian States. In the selection of the Councillors, local talent should be utilised to the utmost possible extent— preference being always given to persons with vested interests in the State so long as they possess the re quisite qualifications. Where local conditions appear to render it im possible for a Council to administer the State suc cessfully, an officer borrowed from Government service may be appointed as Superintendent or Admi nistrator of the State. Where expressly desired by the late Ruler the minority administration should in important matters consult with Ruling Princes or Chiefs nomi nated by him for this purpose. ( 2 ) Old traditions and customs of the State should be scrupulously observed and maintained. [The word “ customs ” includes, among other . things— (a) the payment to the minor Prince or Chief and to members of his family60 on all occasions, of due consideration by all officers serving in the State ; (b) the maintenance of the dignity of the minor Prince or Chief by the strict obser vance of the customary ceremonial honours and courtesies due to him by officers of the Imperial Government and by other Rulers ; and (c) the performance on due date of reli gious ceremonies, festivals, and social observances, including the exchange of presents with other States.] (3) The regulations and records embodying the established policy of the State should be care fully studied. Except in the case of obvious and unmistakeable abuses, radical changes (such as important constitutional reforms, alteration of the Court language or of the postal, taxation, or cur rency systems, &amp;c.) should, as a general rule, be avoided. Any new measures adopted should, so far as circumstances permit, be grafted on and assimilated to existing institutions in the State, and should be so designed, introduced and carried into effect, that they can be continued by the re gular administration after termination of the minority. Where any radical change, or any important measure which is contrary to the express wishes or policy of the late Ruler is proposed, the matter should be referred with full particulars to the Government of India for decision. (4) For appointments in the State service local talent should be used wherever possible. Where local talent is not available, outsiders may be imported for special purposes, but these should be strictly required to conform to local conditions and customs and to show due respect to the mem bers of the ruling family. When the services of outsiders are engaged, their deputation should ordinarily be liable to termination at the discretion of the Ruler after he receives his powers. Persons who are known to have been disloyal or obnoxious to the late Ruler or his family should not be appointed to State service during a minority.61 (5) Treaty rights should be strictly upheld and measures involving any modification of existing treaties and engagements should be avoided. No alteration should be made affecting the recognized political status of fiefs under the suzerainty of a Darbar or their customary relations with the Euler and his State. ( 6 ) No jagirs or hereditary or personal honours and distinctions should be granted or promised on behalf of the State during the minority, nor should such jagirs, honours, etc., be confiscated except for disloyalty or gross misconduct. Custom ary jagirs and maintenance allowances granted by the late Ruler to members of the Ruling family and others should ordinarily be maintained, and no increase or decrease or new grant should be allowed except for special reasons and with the sanction of the Government of India or other political authority to whom this power may be delegated ; such sanction would apply only to the period of the minority. ( 7 ) Interference with the private property, estates, or establishments of members of the Ruling family should be avoided, and the customary and reasonable presents, easements, etc., to them and their dependents, should not ordinarily be curtailed. ( 8 ) In States where a distinction is made between State and Privy Purse funds, the fixed Privy Purse allowance, if on a reasonable scale, should be paid by the State without reduction to the minor Ruler and kept in trust for him, together with the private property bequeathed to him by the late Ruler, until he attains majority. Expendi ture from Privv Purse funds should be limited to the usual and customary items of expenditure. ( 9 ) The sale of State jewellery during a minority should ordinarily be avoided. If such is found absolutely necessary to meet debts, great care should be taken in the selection of the articles to be sold, and the wishes of members of the Ruler’s family should be consulted and respected.62 Proposals for such sales should be refererd to Gov ernment and their sanction obtained before the pro posal is carried out. ( 10 ) No State territory or other immovable property should be exchanged, ceded, or sold during a minority. ( 11 ) No permanent rights or privileges should be granted by the minority administration to jagir- dars, officials or subjects of the State. ( 12 ) No permanent or long-term commercial concessions or monopolies should ordinarily be granted to individuals or companies. It should, however, be borne in mind that neither individuals nor companies would be willing to sink any considerable capital sum in undertakings for short periods, and in each case, therefore, the rule must be applied cautiously with regard to the best interests of the State concerned, in order that the development of important and valuable industries may not be hindered. (13) Expenditure on new palaces intended for a Euler’s own use should be avoided. Outlay on public works generally should be undertaken with due regard to economy and limited to necessary works. The expenditure should be so regulated a» to come within the ordinary income of the year and to leave a substantial annual balance. Ex penditure from surplus and reserve funds should be limited to really productive or protective works and should not be undertaken without careful ex amination and expert advice. (14) Communication with the ladies of the palace should be conducted according to the custom of the State. Palace arrangements existing m the time of the late Euler should not ordinarily be altered, and nothing should be done contrary to zenana etiquette and custom. (15) The education and training of the young Euler should be conducted Vidt Appendix att ched. lines laid down in the report* of the Committee convened to consider63 the matter. As a general rule it is preferable that he should receive his education in India rather than in Europe. (16) Care should be taken to maintain shoot' ing preserves and the necessary establishment for their maintenance, where such exists. Shooting rules and restrictions observed in the time of the late Ruler should be strictly enforced. (17) The Political Officer is answerable to the Government of India for the maintenance of these principles. The degree of supervision to be exercised by him will depend on the circumstanc, s of each particular case. Appendix to paragraph 52. Report of the Committee convened to consider the question of the education and training of Minor Rulers. For purposes of this discussion we have assum ed that ruling powers will ordinarily be assumed by the Minor Ruler at the age of 18 years. 2 . As a diversity of opinion exists as to the desirability of the Minor Prince receiving any portion of his training in Europe, the Committee are not in a position to make any recommendations on the subject. 3 . Without attempting to draw up a regular cur riculum, which can be safely left to those responsible for the scholastic education of the young Prince, we wish to emphasize that his studies should take such form as may best develop his mental faculties, and that it is most essential that he should acquire such a thorough knowledge of the English language as will enable him to talk and read it, and express and record his thoughts in that language with facility. He must also of course be thoroughly at home in the vernacular of his State. 4 . Where such vernacular is not that generally spoken in other parts of India a colloquial knowledge of Hindi or Urdu is desirable. 5 . During the period of his early education the Tutor or Guardian should ordinarily reside65 7. The Minor Ruler should tour in his State and thus acquire knowledge of localities, and of the people inhabiting them, as also of the local landowners and jagirdars. He should be shown in the most practical manner how survey and settlement work is done, how jamabandi is carried out, revenue collected and village records kept. He can be shown selected fields, and have the cost of production, the value of the crop, the State demand, and the profit left to the cultivator, all explained to him. He can study the indebtedness of cultivators and the interest they have to pay, and other economic problems connected with the welfare of the village community. He can also be shown the work of District Offices and Tahsils and the tour can be utilized to afford opportunities for the Minor Ruler to acquire facility in replying to addresses. 8 . While practical training in administrative work is going on, the Minor Prince should also study with his Tutor theoretical problems bearing on such State work. He should also study important ques tions of the day, History, especially of India and his own State, Biographies, English Literature, and healthy books of fiction. The study of the system of Parliamentary Government and of the British Government of India, etc., should also claim his attention. As the time draws near for the young Ruler to assume ruling powers, he should read up the correspondence between the British Government and the State and between the Ruler and his Ministers, and should study all the Treaties and Agreements between his State and the British Government. He should also attend meetings of the Council and take part in their deliberations. 9. The physical training including manly sports and games of the Minor Ruler is also of the highest importance and where possible his military training should be carried on in the State side by side with his administrative training. 10 . Throughout the training of the Minor Ruler times should be fixed for him to meet his rela tions, and also for him to receive Nobles or others in audience in the presence of his Guardian. M1FD »66 11. Ordinarily it is not desirable that young Rulers should be absent from their States during the period of administrative training, except for necessary reasons or for a well-earned holiday. 12. Particular attention should be paid to the selection of a well qualified, conscientious and sympathetic Tutor or Guardian of suitable age. The Minor Ruler’s relations or those responsible for his bringing up should nominate the Tutor or Guardian for the approval of the Government of India. llth June 1909. 13. In the event of the Minor Ruler being sent to Europe for any part of his education, it is essential that the principles, recorded herein, regarding proper supervision and guardianship, should apply. It is generally desirable, where possible, that the Minor Ruler should be accompanied by one or more relations or Sirdars, who would keep him in touch with the customs and manners of his own people or that such other arrangements as are possible should be made with this object in view. cy. cir.

Any stations in the Nil- giris or Palni Hills. Such consent will, however, be subject in all cases to certain conditions. The following will always be required and it is left to the Government of Bombay to impose others in accordance with their previous practice in cases where they are concern' ed :— (i) No transfer of the property will be effected nor any incumbrance on it created without the previous consent of the Governmenl of India or the Local Government con cerned ; (ii) A responsible Agent will be appointed in the locality in which the property is situated, to answer the authorities in case of need ; (in) The property will not be used without the previous consent of the Government of India or the Local Government concern ed for purposes other than residential ; and * The Government of India reserve to themselves direction to a J 1 © this list as may be necessary.68 (iv) The property where acquired by a Prince or Chief will be acquired as State property and not as personal property. The Government of India understand that Ruling Princes and Chiefs sometimes find it to their ad vantage to acquire benami. They have no objection to this method of acquisition provided that their previous consent is obtained, and provided also that once the transaction is completed the Ruling Prince or Chief steps into his real position. The above procedure does not extend to the pre vention of the acquisition of residential property by bequest or succession. The question whether the individual beneficiary should be desired to divest himself of his proprietory rights in the property and, if so, in what manner and within what period, will be a matter for decision in each case with reference to the particular circumstances. II. Acquisition of residential 'property in British India in general. —The Government of India have no objection to the acquisition by Ruling Princes and Chiefs, their near relatives or notables of their States, whether by purchase, mortgage or lease, of immov able property for residential purposes in any part of British India other than the towns and hill stations named above, provided that previous intimation of the intention to acquire such property is given to the Local Government concerned - and that conditions (i) to (iv) of clause I are recognised and accepted. III. The Government of India are pleased to delegate to the Governments of Madras, Bombay, Bengal, United Provinces, Punjab, Bihar and Orissa, Assam and the Central Provinces the power to ap prove acquisitions of immovable property for resi dential purposes within the Province concerned by Rulers, their near relatives and notables of.

In all cases of extradition from British Extraditii n from British India India to State temtorv, to State territory. Political Officers should be guided by the Extradition Act, 1903, and the Rules framed thereunder. The Act and Rules con tain provisions for giving effect to extradition treaties where these exist. 59. The following are the rules made by For.Dept.Notfn. Rules under the Indian Extra- the Governor-General in?°:, ,olu 62 'tr A '' dition Act ( xv of 1903 ). Council in exercise of the 3«2-^ pov/ers conferred by the Indian (Foreign Jurisdic- dated 28t ti Aug. tion) Order in Council. 1902, and by section 22 of 1908, the Indian Extradition Act, 1903 (XV of 1903):— (1) The Political Agent shall not issue a warrant under section 7 of the Indian Extradi tion 4ct, 1903 (hereinafter referred to as “ the said Act ”), in any case which is pro vided for by Treaty, if the State concerned has expressly stated that it desires to abide by the procedure of the Treaty, nor in any case in which a requisition for sur render has been made by, or on behalf of, the State under section 9 of the said Act. f2) The Political Agent shall not issue a war rant under section 7 of the said Act except on a reouest preferred to him m writing either by, or by the autho rity of, the person for the time being administering the Executive Govern ment of the State for which he is a Political Agent, or by amy Court within such State which has been specified in this behalf by the Governor-General in Council, or by the Governor of Madras or Bombay in Council, as the case may be, by notification in the official “ Gazette.” (?,) If the accused person is a British subject, the Political Agent shall, before issuing a warrant under section 7 of the said Act..1 — 1 74 consider wliether he ought not to certify the case as one suitable for trial in British India, and he shall, instead of issuing such a warrant, so certify the case, if he is satisfied that the interests of justice and the convenience of witnesses can be better served by the trial being held in British » India. xr C lt eo?™*’ ( 4 ) The Political Agent shall, in all cases be- dated 25 th March l ore issuing a warrant under section 7 ot 1913. the said Act, satisfy himself by prelimi nary enquiry that there is a 'prima facie case against the accused person. (5) The Political Agent shall, before issuing a warrant under section 7 of the said Act, decide whether the warrant shall provide for the delivery of the accused persons— (а) To the Political Agent or to a British officer subordinate to the Political Agent with a view to his trial by the Political Agent, or (б) To an authority of the State with a view to his trial by the State Courts. Before coming to a decision the Political Agent shall take the following matters into con sideration :— (i) The nature of the offence charged ; (ii) The delay and trouble involved in bring ing the accused person before himself ; (in) The judicial qualifications of the Courts of the State ; (iv) Whether the accused person is a British subject or not, and if he is a British (other than European British) subject whether the Courts of the State, either by custom or by recognition, try such British subjects surrendered to them ; and (v) Whether the Courts of the State have, by custom or by recognition, power to inflict the punishment which may be inflicted under the Indian Penal Code for an75 offence similar to that with which the accused person is charged. (6) Notwithstanding anything in lule 5, the Political Agent shall make the warrant provide for the delivery of the accused persons to himself (or to an officer sub ordinate to himself), or to an authority of the State concerned, as the case may be, if he is generally or specially instructed by the Governor-General in Council to try an accused person himself or to make him over for trial to the proper Court of such State. (7) In the case of an accused person made over for trial to the Court of the State the Political Agent shall satisfy himself that the accused receives a fair trial, and that the punishment inflicted on conviction is not excessive or barbarous ; and, if he is not so satisfied, he shall demand the restoration of the prisoner to his custody, pending the orders of the Gov ernor-General in Council. (8) Accused persons arrested in British India on warrants issued under section 7 or sec tion 9 of the said Act shall be treated as far as possible in the same way as persons under trial in British India. (9) A person sentenced to imprisonment by a Political Agent shall, if a British subject,, be conveyed to the most convenient prison under British administration, and shall there be dealt with as though he had been sentenced under the local law ; Provided always that this rule shall not be construed so as to give such person any right of appeal other than that allowed by the rules for the time being in force for regulating appeals from the decisions of the Political Agent.76 Cf. For. Dept. Cir. No. 2329- 2330-I.C., dated 22nd June 1907. (10) Nothing in these rules shall be held to apply to areas in Indian States under British jurisdiction, in which the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898), is in force. 60. While section 7 of the Indian Extradition A .... , T ,. , Act authorises a Political Application by Indian States for ... surrender in case of non-scheduled Agent to isSUC his Warrant offences. on jy j n respect of an offence described in the First Schedule to the Act there is no such limitation to proceedings under section 9 of the Act. When a D. rbar makes an appli cation for the surrender of a criminal, it does not necessarily distinguish between an application for the issue of a warrant under section 7 and for surrender under section 9 of the Act. Action under the latter section should not be taken unless it is speciiically pressed for. Accordingly, when the appli cation is for the surrender of a person accused of a non-extradition offence, the Political Officer receiv ing the requisition should first point out that the issue of a warrant under section 7 of the Act is im practicable. Should the Darbar notwithstanding express a desire to proceed by way of section 9, the Political Agent should forward the requisition for the orders cf the Local Government having juris diction over the place where the offender is supposed to be, or in special cases, if the Darbar so desire, for the orders of the Government of India. In order to assist the Government concerned in arriving at a decision he should further submit with the requisi tion a report on the circumstances of the case.and his own recommendation as to whether the Darbar’s request should be granted or refused. 61. Under section 54 (seventhly) of the Code Arrest of absconding offenders of Crimi ™! Procedure any in British India in advance of pro- Police Officer may arrest ceedings under Act xv of 1903 . w i t h out warrant any per son who has been concerned in, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible in formation has been received or a reasonable suspi cion exists of his having been concerned in, any act committed at any place out of British India which,77 if committed in British India, would have been punishable as an offence, and for which he is, under any law relating to extradition or under the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, or otherwise, liable to be ap prehended or detained in custody in British India. It is open to Political Officers at their discretion to take steps by telegraph or otherwise to secure the arrest of offenders under these powers in advance of the issue of a formal warrant under section 7 of the Indian Extradition Act, 1903. 62. The Indian Extradition Act and the Rules thereunder have, as such, Extradition from State tern- no application to CXtra- tory to British .India. dition Jrom btate territory. But subject to exceptions based on local customs, applications to a Darbar for extradition should ordi narily be restricted to, and may ordinarily include, cases in which the alleged offence is one constituting an extradition offence under treaty with the State concerned or within the meaning of the British Indian Act; though in special cases a Political Officer, when moved thereto, may at his discretion request extra dition for any other offence in the same way as it is open to a Darbar to do so under section 9 of the British Indian Act in the converse case. It should not be forgotten in the case of States having extradition treaties, that though neither party to a treaty may do less than is enjoined thereby, either party may do more. The Schedule to the Indian Extradition Act is more extended than that annexed to most of the extradition treaties with Darbars and thus places the Political Agent in a position to procure for a Darbar extradition from British India in respect of offences not included in the treaty with the particular Darbar. Where a Darbar avails itself of the extended facilities thus provided by the British Indian Act, there is no need for hesitation in forwarding to it applications for extradition in respect of any offence included in the Schedule to the Act though it may not appear in that annexed to the treaty.— 78 Cf.

In deciding whether an application should or should not be made for surrender in such cases Political Officers should be guided by the particular circumstances, regard being had to the nature of the offence for which the offender is undergoing imprisonment in the Indian Stnte, the nature of the offence for which surrender is sought, and the prob ability or otherwise of his being convicted for such offence. 65. When a Political Officer receives from a Procedure on receipt by Pdi- proper authority in British tiefti officer of an application for India a requisition for extradition. the extradition of an alleged offender supposed to have taken refuge in State territory, he should f rst see that the requisition is accompanied by prima facie evidence record ed on oath by a Magistrate and that the alleged offence is one for which extradition may properly be asked, having regard to the principles stated in the preceding paragraphs. If in his opinion both these conditions are satisfied, he should transmit the application and its accompaniments to the Darbar. If he finds that the primd facie evidence has been omitted or has not been recorded in due form or that the offence is one for which it is not incumbent on the Darbar under treaty or other wise to grant extradition and in respect of which79 it would be unadvisable to request surrender as a matter of comity, then he should return the requi sition to the authority in British India with a state ment of his reasons for non-compliance. 66. When a Political Officer receives from a proper authority in Brit- foraiafapplication f&lt;^rTitrofUtlon! kh . In d ia a mere “PP 1 '' cation for arrest accom panied by a statement of the information on which the request is made, the request should ordinarily be transmitted to the Darbar, the British Indian authority being simultaneously asked to forward at the earliest possible date the formal application for extra dition accompanied by the usual primd facie case. In the event of undue delay in the arrival of such formal application, Political Officers should bear in mind that the ordinary limit of detention in similar cases in British India is two months [vide section 10 (3) of the Indian Extradition Act, 1903]. 67. In some cases special arrangements have been Cf- For. Dept. ^ + .... made to regulate interstat-!? tte p to A £ en t Interstatal extradition. . ° . _ TT1 the Oovr.-Uenl. in al extradition. Where Central India, No. no such arrangement exists all that one Darbar 324 - 1 ., dated 9th can reasonably demand from another and all that Feb ' 1883, the Paramount Power can be expected to assist in obtaining, is such co-operation as may be consistent with the principles of comity applied with due regard to the particular circumstances of the two States concerned. Applications for interstatal extradition should ordinarily be accompanied by 'primd facie evidence of the offence charged, whether the accused be a subject of the State asking extra dition or not. 68. As regards the part which Political Offi cers should take in nego- reg A .rf‘to’in!e™S‘U°t*Sucn n for interstatal ex- tradition, no absolute rule can be laid down. But ordinarily Political Officers when transmitting such applications for extradition should observe a neutral attitude and should be careful not to carry intervention further than is80 really necessary. As a general rule, they should re frain from certifying a suspected offender to be primd facie guilty, and should merely transmit a statement of the case with the application for surrender after seeing that there is nothing repugnant to justice or public policy in the application. Cases may occur in which a Political Officer at his discretion may give his imprimatur to an application for extradition, but any reasonable request for further information by the State from which extradition is demanded should invariably be supported.

But the exercise of criminal j urisdiction over such persons by Indian States is none the less subject to the control of the Government of India. Except in cases which can properly be disposed of under arrangements al ready approved, the orders of the Government of India should be taken in each case as to the procedure pro posed. 71. By the law of British India all Indian sub jects of His Majesty and all servants of the King, whether British subjects or not, are amenable to British Indian jurisdiction for crime committed in the territories of an Indian State. The extent to which this jurisdiction should be exercised must depend o i treaties, engagements, local practice, the conditions of each State, and the circumstances of each case. Where jurisdiction is left with the Darbar Courts, there is a right of repre sentation to the political Agent, who should not however interfere save in special circumstances. 72.

When, however, such an officer or soldier while not on leave, commits within an Indian State an offence in respect of which he is liable by the law of the State to arrest, he may be arrested by State authority, provided that the circumstances are not such as to allow of immediate arrest by the military authorities.

The military authorities, on receiving such a request should either deliver over the offender or forthwith refer the question as to the Court before which the proceedings are to be instituted for the decision of the Governor-General in Council.83 In order to promote the ends of justice and to meet the convenience of Darbar officials or subjects whose attendance may be necessary at the trial of an Indian officer or soldier of the Indian Army wh° may have committed an offence within the” terri tories of an Indian State, the military authorities will arrange that in such cases, whenever the exi gencies of military service permit, the offender shall be tried at the cantonment nearest to the place where the offence was committed. 73.

As regards the issue of com missions in civil cases, reference should be made to Part III of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ; in respect of commissions issued by Criminal Courts outside British India, reference should be made to section 21 of the Indian Extradition Act, 1903. 75.

In executing commissions received under section 503 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, Political officers should be careful to observe the provisions of the law strictly and should note inter aha that though the law authorises delegation \o a subordinate officer invested with powers not less than those exer cised by a Magistrate of the erst class inPritish India, there is no authority for making over the commission for execution by a Magistrate subordinate to a Dur bar ; secondly, that the evidence should be recorded in the manner prescribed by Chapter XXV of the Coue of Criminal Procedure, 1898, for the hearing of war rant cases. 76. Section 44 of the Code of Civil Procedure) 1908, provides for the exe- Execution of decrees. cution in British India of the decrees cf certain Civil or Bevenuc Courts situate in the territories of an Indian State, as if they had been passed by the Courts of British India. Where Courts of Indian States are notified under this section, it is the practice for the State concerned to reciprocate in the execution cf decrees of British Courts. Where a decree has been passed by an Indian State Court not notified under section 44 of the Code, it isopen to the decree-holder to seel: a fresh decree in a British Court on the basis of the decree of the Indian State Court. Reference may be made in this connection to sections 13 and 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Conversely, in any case in which an Indian State Court is not prepared to execute a British Indian decree as such, it is open to the holder of such a decree to seek a fresh decree in the Indian State Court on the basis of the British Indian decree.

(b) Refunds of differential duty may also be granted on arms purchased by or on be half of natural born or naturalized sub jects of His Majesty resident in Indian States, Foreign Settlements, tribal or administered areas and States bordering on the Indian Frontier, who would in British India, be lawfully entitled to pos sess arms; provided always that the arms are intended for the personal use . of the purchaser or of another British subject who, in British India, would be lawfully entitled to possess arms. If the purchaser or the person for whom the purchase is made is a European and no doubt exists as to his identity, no courtesy certificate is required. In all other cases, i.e., those where the pur-92 chaser or the person for whom the pur chase is made is either a European whose identity is at all doubtful, or a non-European, a reference should be made to, and no refund granted except on the recommendation of, the local Political authority. (c) All cases which do not fall within the scope of the instructions in (a) and (b) above, but in which the grant of a refund of differencial duty is recommended for any special reasons, should be submitted for the orders of the Government of India in the Commerce and Industry Department through the Local Govern ment or Local Administration concerned. As regards the courtesy certificates referred to in (a) and (b) above, Political Officers to whom applications for such certificates may be made should be careful not to grant certificates except in cases which are covered by the above orders. The ground on which a refund is recommended (i.e., either that the purchaser of the arms is a British subject who would be entitled to possess the arms in British India or that he is a Puling Prince or Chief or Notable to whom it is desirable that the concession should be made as a matter of courtesy) should be entered in the certificate, and the certificate should also indicate whether the weapons specified in it are for the personal use of the purchaser or lor other purpose.

They should further bear in mind that it is to the Ruling Prince or Chief that the troops and subjects of each State should look for appointments and promo tions, and that where the custom of an Indian State leads to special consideration of family considera tions and social position, the moral influence of men selected m sach grounds may be expected to counter balance a want of pxfcssienal knowledge i They ihoald be scrupulously careful to act in all matters in communication .and accord with the Lo.-al Governments and political authorities.

Appointments to the Political Department of the Government of India are made from both Euro pean and Indian members of the Indian Civil Service and officers of the Indian Aimy holding the King’s Commission ; and also, in cases of exceptional merit, Indian members of the Provincial Civil Service. The rules regulating the admission of officers of the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Army are reproduced in Appendix XII. In the case of mem bers of the Provincial Civil Service application should be made in the form prescribed for members of the Indian Civil Service, but the Government of India desire to receive, in addition, full information of the services rendered by candidates of the Provincial Service which are held to be exceptionally meritor ious. The rule in respect of marriage is not enforced in the case of Indian candidates for the Political De partment. * Rules of vrocedure to befolbwed by Gazetted ojjwers serving under the Governmen t of India in the Foreign and Pblitical Department, when 'submitting apph_ cations for leave or when proceeding on, or returning from, Ibwe out of India. ■ trations corresponding direct with the Foreign e addressed twice annually (usua% in March 5 t toVeport whether they or any o^he officers , under them contemplate applying for leave ts commencing respectively on the following 1st 3 very durable that all officers desirW leave response toNhese enquiries and that applications le at short no\ke except in circumstance^ real \ V returns have beek scrutinized and the posWs ,1 Administrations,Vtc., will be informed ofUhe os can be favourably considered, and fonkal ubmitted by tbe officebs concerned, accompamtf Seer as to tbe applicant’\title to the leave applie! ing on leave out of India should report his arrival ■3 his address w h‘ le °“ t0 the H ‘S h Com ' missioner for IndiarLondon (Supplementary Rule 242). .Corrigendum to the Political Department Manual, 1924.

Rules oj procedure to be followed by officers of the Indian Political Service, when submitting applications for leave o r when proceeding on, or returning from leave. All officers and Administrations corresponding direct with the External Affairs and Political Departments are addressed twice annually (usually in March and September) with a request to report whether they or any of the officers of the Indian Political Service serving under them contemplate applying for leave during the periods of 6 months commenc ing respectively on the following 1st July and 1st January. It is very desirable that all officers desiring leave should express their wishes in response to these enquiries and that applications for leave should never be made at short notice except in circumstances of real and unforeseen necessity. 2. When the half-yearly returns have been scrutinised and the post ings position considered, the local Administrations etc, will be informed of the extent to which applications can be favourably considered, and foimal applications should then be submitted by the officers concerned, accompanied by a report from the Audit Officer as to the applicant’s title to the leave applied for. 3. Every officer proceeding on leave must report to the Under Secre- I t.'iiy in the Political Department a week in advance: (a) the name of j the ship in which he intends to embark or (b) if he travels by air, the / date of departure by plane and the name of the air transport company i by which he will be travelling, and (c) his address on leave. If there | should be any change in his leave address he should notify it at once (a)( if in England, a Dominion or Colony, to the High Commr. or other’ appropriate authority, and (b) if on leave in India, direct to the Under. Secretary, Political Department. 4. Every effort will be made to ensure that an officer on leave out of India shall be informed through the High Commissioner for India of his posting on return from leave in good time before the date of embarka tion. Failing this, or in case of change of orders, intimation will be made direct by wireless message to the Ship on which he is travelling. 5. Every officer on leave out of India should, before his return, com municate direct to the Under Secretary, Political Department (and in the case of an officer proceeding to the N.-W.F.P. to the Chief Secretary to the Government of the N.-W.F.P.) the probable dates of his embarka tion for and arrival in India, the port at which he proposes to land and the steamer by which he will travel.

The loan of a carriage and horses from a Use of Durbar carriages and State for the Conveyance horses. of a Political Officer to the Durbar, on occasions of ceremonial or business visits, is permissible ; but such a carriage should never, without special permission from the Govern ment of India be kept in the Residency or Agency coach-house, or used for the private or family pur poses of the Political Agent. Cf. For. Dept, letter No. 4440- I.A., dated 13th Nov. 1907, to Agent to the Gov.-Genl., Rajputana. Letter No. 4496- I.B., dated 18th Nov. 1607. Cir. Nos. 498:1- 4986-1. B., dated 3let Dec. 1907. On his arrival at or departure from his station,- its use is also permitted. For the rest, a Political Officer must supply his own wants as befits his means and requirements, whether official or pri vate. In the event of his going on tour a distinction is drawn between journeys undertaken in the course of his ordinary duties, and those in which a Political Officer accompanies a Ruling Prince or Chief, or travels100 long distances in the interests of a State. Some courtesies and conveniences of travel cannot be refused in the latter case ; but here, as in other similar exceptions, the extent of the dependence of a Political Officer on a Durbar should be reported to the head of the Administration or Local Government. Cf. For. Dept, letter No. 3685-1. B., dated 15th Sept. 1908. 105. In certain cases a Political Officer is provid ed with a fully* fur- and furniture. ^ either the property of Government or has been acquired or leased by Government from the Durbar concerned. In some instances when the grounds are too extensive for a Political Officer to keep up at his own expense a grant is also made to him by Government to enable him to do this. In such cases, a Political Officer is required to pay rent for the house, under Article 325 of the Public W orks Department Code, subject to a maximum of 10 per cent, of his salary and local allowance. Where no furniture is supplied and no assistance is given by Government towards the upkeep of the grounds, the maximum limit of the rent payable is reduced to 5 per cent, of the officer’s salary and local allowance. * In certain cases, where the Durbar is unwilling to sell or lease its property to Government, a Politi cal Officer is permitted, with the special sanction of the Government of India, to occupy a house belong ing to the Durbar rent-free, subject to the following rules : — (a) No expenditure for alterations or addi tions to the house should be put upon the Durbar, without the prior written consent of Government. (b) If the Durbar is unwilling to sell or re move the furniture already in the house, it may be allowed to remain, but no renewals or renovations should be made at the cost of the Durbar, without the special sanction of the Government of India. , ]- xc . pt cs regards linen, crockery, cutl iy, cooking utensils and lamps.101 (c) Wherever possible, such houses are fully* furnished by Government and Political Officers pay rent for the same, calculat ed at 8 per cent, of the value of the fur niture required for personal use only, subject to a maximum of 5 per cent, of salary and local allowance. {d) Without the prior consent of the Local Government, Durbar servants should not be utilised for the care of the house or the maintenance of gardens. Political Officer is allowed, without special permission from the Government of India, to occupy free quarters at the expense of a Durbar in British territory ; when such accommodation is considered necessary it is ordinarily provided by Government and not by the Indian States. The provision of a house, whether on loan, lease or other terms, by an Indian State for a Political Officer or his family, at a hill station, is also prohibited, except with the special sanction of the Government of India. The above instructions do not apply to houses cf. For. Dept- of the nature of public rest-houses and guest-houses Resoin.

If the Indian State makes its own arrangements independently of the Political Officer and outside his residence, there is no occasion for this scrutiny, but in so far as the Political Officer arranges for the entertainment of the Governor- General in his own house, on behalf of the Durbar, nothing should l e done at the expense of the Durbar without the full knowledge and approval of the Government of India. Like instructions apply in the case of visits made by the head of the Local Government or Administration save that in such cases the report of the Political Officer may.be disposed of under the orders of the Local Govern ment or Administration. In the case of visits of travellers or distinguish ed strangers, a clear line should be drawn between hospitality extended by the Durbar itself, in its own guest-houses, and that given at the residence of the Political Officer. A Political Officer should have no general authority to entertain the guests of a Durbar at its cost, in his own house. Cases may occur where a foreigner or other guest of distinction, invited by the Ruling Prince or Chief, can most con veniently be received at the Residency, but if any part of the cost of the arrangements is to fall on the State, the previous sanction of the Local Government or Administration should be obtained. Otherwise every guest entertained by a Political Officer should be entertained at his own cost. *Cf. For. Dept. 107. Tents are provided on an appropriate Resoin.

The acceptance by an officer'in political employ of free supplies of Transport, supplies, etc. fue l, fodder lighting or minor accessories of any description from Durbars or Indian State officials or at the cost of Local Funds is absolutely prohibited at head quarters. In camp, it may often be necessary to apply to the local authorities for help in regard to both transport and supplies, as it is important that the movements of a Political Officer should not be restricted by such considerations. In these cases the Durbar is ordinarily expected to sanction and regulate such applications, on payment by the indenting officer. Where camels or carts can be hired there should be no recourse to the Durbar. 109. In cases in which a local Political or Medi Naming of public institutions cal Officer is approached after Political Officers.' with a view to a public institution, such as a library, hospital or school, being named after him, the matter saould be referred to the head of the Local Administration or to the Government of India, as the case may be, before consent is given. ^ ^ 110.

(3) On all other officers on the time-scale, on the departure on transfer, or long leave, either of the reporting officer himself, or of the officer reported on. These reports while giving information as far as possible regarding general ability, tact, temper, judgment, accessibility, state of health, horseman ship, self-reliance, power of commanding respect, reticence, and capacity to keep secrets, should be on broad and general lines and should invariably give an opinion as to an officer’s fitness for promo tion and his ability to speak the vernacular. The report, for the year in which an officer draws pay at the rate of Rs. 1,250 a month inclusive of personal allowance, should contain an expression of opinion whether the officer in question is qualified to hold a superior appointment. Attention is drawn to Home Department Reso lution No. 1568-1595, dated 14th September 1915, w r hich deals with the question of the communication to subordinate officers in civil employ of such un favourable remarks as may be made in regard to them by their superiors at the time of annual reports or on other occasions. 108APPENDICESIll APPENDIX I.

Every memorial received for transmission Prompt submission ol memo. and not withheld Under iis. the foregoing rules should ordinarily be forwarded within a month of the date of receipt. In any instance in which this period is exceeded, an explanation of the cause of delay shou be given. 4. The following procedure, which is in Procedure in regard to petition force in British India, for mercy. is applicable, as far as circumstances permit, in the case of the presenta tion to a Local Government or Administration (or Political Officer, if he is in direct relations with the Government of India) of a petition for mercy, addressed to His Majesty the King-Emperor, the Secretary of State or the Governor-General in Council, by or on behalf of a person sentenced to death by a court in an Indian State when the sentence requires the confirmation of a Political Officer :— Cf. For. Dept, endt. No. 138-G., dated 14th Jan. 1909, forwarding Home Dept. Cir. Noe. 3005-3014, dated 2l8t Dec. 1908. Cf. For. and Pol. Dept. Cir. No. 45 G., dated 12*h Jany. 1917. I. A convict under sentence of death shall be allowed, for the preparation and submission of a petition for mercy to the Governor General in Council, seven days after, and exclu sive of, the date on which the Super intendent of the jail has informed him of the rejection of his petition by the Local Government. Every petition addressed to the Governor-General in Council which has been submitted within this period shall be forwarded to the Government of India, and the execution shall be postponed, pend ing the receipt of their orders. II. Should a convict submit a petition for mercy addressed to the Governor- General in Council after the seven days prescribed in rule I, the Local Government shall withhold it, except in the following circumstances, when the Local Government shall forward it to the Government of India and122 shall simultaneously postpone execu tion, pending the receipt of the orders of the Governor-General in Coun cil :— (1) if the sentence of death was passed by the High Court, Chief Court, or Judicial Commissioner’s Court upon an appeal against the acquittal of the petitioner by the Court of Session, or upon an application for enhancement of sentence, which has been preferred by the Local Government; or (2) when in the opinion of the Local Government there is any reasonable probability that the Government of India may take a different view of the propriety of the death sentence ; or (3) when there are any other circumstances about the case which, in the opinion of the Local Government, render it desirable that the Governor-General in Council should have an opportunity of considering it. III. When a petition for mercy is addressed to the Governor-General in Council through the Local Government, and no previous petition has been submitted to the latter authority, the Local Government should withhold the petition, treating it as if it were addressed to itself, in all cases, except when the death sentence is the result of an appeal against the convict’s acquittal by the Court of Session, or of an application for enhancement of sentence, which has been preferred by the Local Government. In these cases, a petition addressed to the Governor-General in Council shall invariably be forwarded, even if the Local Government has not been pre viously memorialised.123 IV. In all cases in which a Local Govern ment submits a petition for mercy from a convict under sentence of death to the Governor-General in Council, it should forward, with the records of the case, its observations in respect of any of the grounds urged in favour of commutation, and, if it had previously rejected any petition addressed to itself, a brief statement of the reasons therefor. V. The Local Government shall expedite as far as possible the process of transmitting petitions for mercy, along with the re cords of the case, to the Government of India, and upon receipt of the latter s orders shall immediately send a telegraphic acknowledgment. Telegraphic acknow ledgments should also be made of all telegrams from the Government of India repeating telegrams or the sub stance of petitions received by them direct from, or on behalf of, convicts under sentence of death. VI. If the convict submits a petition address ed to His Majesty the King-Emperor or the Secretary of State, the Local Government may dispose of it on its own responsibility when a previous petition has already been addressed to the Governor-General in Council, or the period prescribed in rule I above for the presentation of such a petition has expired. In other cases, a peti tion addressed to His Majesty or to the Secretary of State should be treated as addressed to the Government of India and forwarded to them. In order to avoid, as far as possible, freouent postponements of the date of execution once fixed, Courts of Sessions are required to fix the period, between the date of receipt by them of the orders of the High Court, etc., confirming the sentence of124 Cf. For. Dept. Cir. No. 4337-1.A., dated 6 th Nov. 1007. death and the date of execution^ at from 21 to 28 days. With a view to minimise the delay connect ed with the consideration of petitions for mercy, the records of the case, as prepared for the use of the High Court, etc., together with the orders of the High Court, etc., thereon, are in all instances to be sent direct to the Local Government as soon as the death sentence has been confirmed, and without waiting for the receipt of a petition for mercy, to be retained until the execution is actually carried out. These records are invariably to be forwarded to the Government of India along with any petition for mercy transmitted by the Local Government. As regards Indian States, the discretion vested in Local Governments and Administrations by rule III above does not apply to simlar petitions received from persons condemned by courts in such territory, when the head of the Local Government or Admi nistration concerned is also the authority which con firms the sentence. In such cases the head of the Local Government or Administration is not authorised to withhold the petition which must always be for warded to the Governor General in Council for con sideration. 5. The rules immediately preceding do not apply Petitions for mercy from Statej i n 1^6 Case of a petition hivmg full power of life a id for mercv addressed to death. v tn? iTOvernor-General in Council by or on behalf of a subject of an Indian State sentenced to death in such State when the State has full powers of life and death over its own subjects, and the sentence of death is not subject to the confirmation of or approval by a Political Offi cer. In such a case the petition should not be forwarded to the Government of India, unless, after enquiry or otherwise, there is reason to suppose that there has been a miscarriage of justice calling for interference. 6. Whenever a petition to the Viceroy for mercy Manner of submitting record in a murder Case is for- in case of petitions for mercy. War ded, the prisoner’s appeal, the judgment of the courts before whom the125 trial or appeal is heard, and all the more important papers connected with the case (or translations of them if the originals are in a vernacular) should be transmitted in type or print. 7. When the orders of the Governor-General Acknowledgment of order re- in Council Commuting Or ceived in respect of petitions for declining to interfere in rcercy ' respect of a sentence of death are conveyed by telegram, a reply should at once be sent to me authority from whom the orders are received distinctly stating the purport of the orders received.

S.-1526 will be sent to civil officers, and in the case of canton ments, to the S. S. 0. at least a fortnight before the supplies are required. Changes in dates, routes or quantities of supplies demanded will be communicated at once to all concerned. The losses caused thereby will only be borne by the State when competent financial authorities are satisfied that the altera tions were necessary. Losses due to excessive esti mating will be borne by the unit responsible. A separate indent will be prepared to meet the require ments of advance parties. The indent form enume rates the articles which may be demanded, and any other articles shall be arranged for privately. The157 advance party in conjunction with the I. A. S.

If double marches are undertaken double rates will be paid for each march. Half hire will be paid for the return journey from the exchanging station to the place where the carnage was engaged. If the carriage is taken beyond the exchanging station full hire will be paid for the return journey from the place where the carriage is released to the place where it was en- gaged, without any allowance for the halts. If the carriage has to be collected before the date on which it is required, the civil authorities will notify the mdenting officer the time required for collection prior to the start, and the probable extra expense that will be incurred. Carriage which ordinarily ply for hire, and are on the list to be kept by the district officer will first be called upon, and the balance will be made up by impressment. Carriage indented for in excess of requirements and discharged, will be paid for at the full hire rate for each day or part of a day for which it is retained. If carriage is declared un serviceable through deliberate fault or culpable ne f?^8 enc c of the cartman, by a committee of officers (which will include a civil officer) it will not be paid for.

(1) The term “ civil ” refers equally in the case of Indian States, to the Darbar or political officer as the case may be. (2) The term district commander includes independent brigade commander. I.—General Principles. It is realised that the size of India, its varying conditions of climate, seasons and environment, combine to render it impracticable to compile a single set of rules to regulate the conduct of man oeuvres which would be suitable for general appli cation throughout the country. It has therefore been found preferable to issue certain general in structions, based on a few main principles, and leave their application in matters of detail to the mutual161 good understanding and common sense of the civil, political and military officers whose duty it may be to apply them. The following are the main principles referred to :— (a) That training in the open country and man- oevres are a necessity for the efficiency of an army for the duties for which it is maintained, and also that if training is to be thorough it should take place, as often as possible, on ground new to the troops. (b) That as the burden or inconvenience caused by the incidence of manoeuvres is one which, for obvious reasons, cannot oe equally shared by the community at large it is of the utmost importance that any such burden or inconvenience to the individual should be reduced to a minimum, and that any actual loss or damage, present or prospective, should receive early and adequate compensa tion. (c) That it is only by the closest co-opera tion between military and civil officers that the above conditions are attainable. II.—Selection of training and manoeuvre areas. 1. District commanders will, in co-operation with the local civil authorities, prepare manoeuvre maps of their commands, marking on them areas where troops can be readily concentrated and economically maintained with a minimum of dis turbance, dislocation of business and inconvenience to the local population. For this purpose local gazetteers should be freely consulted and will be found to be of much assistance. These maps should be revised periodically and should show in distinctive colours the areas most suitable for divi sional and brigade manoeuvres, collective training of all units field firing and artillery practice camps. At such time as may be found mutually con venient, the district commander will, in consulta tion with the civil authorities, select the areas for M1FD162 3^. v divisional and other manoeuvres, practice camps etc., during the ensuing training season, the general principle being that as many years as possible should elapse between manoeuvres in the same area —the minimum to be aimed at being one clear year. It should, however, be understood that this system of rotation of areas does not apply to ordi nary collective training or to minor operations of two or three days’ duration held in the vicinity of cantonments, when troops are self-supplied, nor to waste areas. Commanders concerned should, however, be careful to safeguard the interests of cultivators against any abuse of this principle. 3. The dates for the proposed manoeuvres should be fixed after consultation with the civil authorities who should be, provided as soon as pos sible with a map of the area and general informa tion regarding the proposed disposition of troops and the general arrangements of supply during manoeuvres. UI—Field firing and artillery practice camps. In framing a scheme for a field firing exercise the first consideration should be the selection of a tract of country, the temporary occupation ot which will cause the least possible inconvenience to the inhabitants ; it follows that waste land should, when practicable, be selected and that it will rare y be possible to make a field firing exercise a conti nuation or finale of manoeuvres. A scheme should then be framed which will fit in with the ground chosen. If these principles be followed it should rarely be necessary to require the evacuation of villages. Should, however, such a course be un avoidable, all arrangements connected with the evacuation will be in the hands of the civil autho rities who will, in consultation with the military authorities, decide the terms under which the eva cuation will take place and the amount or scale of compensation, if any, for disturbance or loss of earnings to be paid to the inhabitants. The ques tion of compensation should also be considered in cases where actual evacuation is held to be unneces sary and where a sufficient margin of -safety can be /163 secured by confining inhabitants within certain limits. In all cases it should be clearly understood that mutual agreement, between the civil and mili tary authorities as to the conditions under which the field firing may be held, must be reached before the exercise takes place, and sufficiently long before hand so that arrangements for training may not be upset. 1V. — Compensation. 1. The machinery for assessment of compensa tion will vary according to circumstances. As a rule it will be preferable in the case of manoeuvres to employ a staff of compensation officers—military and civil—the military side of the staff including, as a rule, Indian officers. If these compensation officers are unable to agree they must refer the matter for the decision of the civil district officer or corresponding authority. When a joint commission is not appointed, the civil authorities will be the sole arbiters, and their decision must be accepted. 2. The methods of assessing compensation can be best considered under two headings : — (a) Damage to movable or immovable property .— Such as wells, walls, trees, houses and live stock, etc. In this case payment on the spot is preferable. Where a joint commission is employed, it will dispose of all claims on the spot, as far as pos sible, pay in cash the sum awarded to, and take an acquittance from the claim ant. When there is no commission, claims will be referred to the local civil authorities for immediate disposal. {b) Damages to crops .—With regard to what is considered “ remediable ” damage, such as damage caused by the movement of troops, it will usually be preferable, in the case of manoeuvres, for the joint commission to arrange for payment of compensation on the spot direct to the injured individual. As an alternative, the civil officer should keep a progressive statement of the area damaged164 together with a rough estimate of the amount of compensation to be finally awarded and keep the military com mander concerned informed thereof at periodical intervals ; the final award being made if possible when the harvest is gathered, or in the Punjab, where the harvest is late, before the end of March, so as to enable the charges to be debited to the training grant for the year. This latter course is one which will usually be the more convenient in the assessment of damage caused by troops training in the vicinity of cantonments. 3. It is of the first importance that the terms under which compensation shall be assessed should be decided before the training season by military and civil authorities in consultation, made known to all concerned, and that claims should be kept to the lowest figure by judicious selection of ground and avoidance of cultivated areas at a season when the crops are most susceptible of damage. The advice of civil officials on these points should always be obtained, and if it can be arranged that this can take the form of a series of lectures on local conditions and methods of cultivation in the dist rict, the best results may be expected to follow. 4. As regards payment of compensation, the principle to be observed is that when possible pay ments should be made on the spot, direct to the claimant and through as few intermediaries as practicable. 5. In the case of manoeuvres the cost of any distinguishing badges for, and any expenditure incurred on, the compensation staff will be defrayed out of the training grant. 6. Military officers are forbidden to award certificates to civil officials such as tahsildars, naib- tahsildars or kanungos. V.—Transport and Supplies. 1. Government transport will be utilised as far as possible ; when hired transport has to be resorted to and the assistance of the civil authorities in con-165 nection with obtaining it is required,jthe rules laid down in Army Regulations, India, Vol. II, paragraph 561 and Appendix XVI w r ill be adhered to. 2. As regards the collection of supplies, the rules contained in Army Regulations, India,vVol. II chapter XI will be followed. In fixing the prices at which supplies locally pro curable are to be paid for, “ price current ” mean 8 the price at which the civil officer, having regard to the facilities for the supply at the halting place or camping ground, is prepared to deliver supplies thereat, and does not mean the price ordinarily pre vailing in the neighbourhood. VI. — Orders to be issued to the troops. Special orders on the following''subjects will be issued, after consultation with the head of the civil district concerned by army, divisional or brigade headquarters concerned before the commencement of manoeuvres ; similar orders should also be included in the standing orders of each station for the guidance of officers conducting field training. If properly carried out by responsible officers, such orders will tend to keep down needless claims for compensation and remove possible chances of friction between soldiers and villagers—- (a) Damage^ and loss of fruit, garden, field or farm' produce ; youngTor standing crops, etc. (b) Cutting'or damage to trees, especially from camel 'grazing. (c) Destruction or damage to hedges, fences etc. (d) Officers’ servants and camp followers. (e) Incomplete obliteration of latrines. (f) Restrictions regarding entrance into villages, places of worship, shrines, etc. (g) Restrictions as to destruction of peafowl, monkeys, pigeons, etc., in places where such are held sacred. (A) T Duty of commanding officers to report at once any damage caused by troops. (i) Treatment of hired transport drivers.APPENDIX IX.

It follows that he must give up for the time being any special pursuit or recreation in which he should happen to be interested unless he can con scientiously share it with his pupil. 3. He should be careful not to mix himself up in, or interfere with, local politics. If his pupil is a Ruling Prince’s or Chief’s son whose father is alive, he should take his instructions from, and defer to, the Prince or Chief in all matters and should have no dealings with any State official. In the case of a minor Ruler, whose State is under administra tion, he should similarly consider himself as directly subordinate to the Political Officer in charge. At the same time he should maintain friendly relations with + all concerned in the administration of the State and should be careful not to prejudice the mind of his pupil against any particular official or noble of the State. 4. In some cases he may find himself in conflict with the ladies of the zenana, who are generally anxious to exercise as much influence as possible over a minor Ruler. This will give rise at times to a difficult situation, and much tact and patience will be required. In such circumstances he should be guided by his sense of duty towards his pupil, and while always studiously polite and considerate to wards the wishes and even prejudices of the zenana ladies, he should be firm in carrying out the instruc tions he has received from the Political Officer, and in doing what he conceives best in the interests of his charge.1C7 5. He should not attempt to influence his ward i n matters of religion, except that he should encourage him to adhere to all State and religious customs and ceremonies until at any rate he is of sufficient age to judge^of these matters for himself. 6. He should encourage his pupil to move in European' society, to be loyal to the British connec tion, and to realise the benefits his State has derived from its dependence on the protection of the Para mount Power. But this does not imply any necessity for encouraging him to eat with Europeans, unless this is expressly desired by the boy’s father, or to abandon any of the ancient and cherished customs of his race and religion. 7. He should enjoin upon his pupil the importance of keeping on good terms with his brother Princes and Chiefs, to give in on small and unimportant points of etiquette, if this will help to establish friendly relations, and not to despise or laugh at the ways and manners of Princes and Chiefs more old- fashioned than himself. 8. It is hardly necessary to lay down that on taking over charge the first point to look to will be the boy’s morals and general behaviour, the formation in fact of his character ; the second point, his health .and the condition of his surroundings, and the third, the nature of his studies. • 9. The first and second of these points, whil 8 they are far the most important, will at the same time be generally the most difficult to deal with, as long as the boy remains at home. It is most neces sary that he should not be estranged or isolated from the society of his own people. At the same time he must, as far as possible, be kept away from flatterers and sycophants and especially, as he grows older, from the ever-present and degrading influences which would lead him into immorality of every kind. To protect him from this his time should be fully occupied with manly outdoor games and pur suits and his surroundings should be c'ean and healthy, to attain which local prejudices will have to be gradually surmounted by tact and personal influence and persuasion.168 10. As regards studies these must of course be adjusted to the age and abilities of the pupil. But as boys in these days will probably join a Chiefs’ college with their guardians, the latter’s duties in this respect will generally consist in merely assisting his ward in preparing his lessons. If the boy has not yet joined a college, the guardian should ordinarily confine himself to teaching the boy to talk, read and write English. This will ensure him a good start on joining. 11. The guardian should not rebuke or criticise his pupil in the presence of servants or subordinates or except in special circumstances, before any other third party. Dept. 12. The direction contained in paragraph 3, that rd™* Jan* giterilian of a minor Prince or Chief whose^t^te ^ is under administration, should consider hiptself as directly subordinate to the Political Offtcerdn charge, governs the cake, of a minor Ruler while^iflndia ; but when a minor Ruler is in England for education or similar purposes, the tjitor or guardian is directly sub ordinate to the Secretaryxpf State and to no one else, as regards all questions connected with the Ruler’s edu cation or the arrangement^tbPie made for his comfort. In such cases, the Political Officer N of the State should communicate with the Ruler or his guardian through the Government ofRidia, though there is no objection, in questions of urgency, to his sending direct to the Secretary of $fate copies of important communica tions which he is making to the Government of 4ndia. The tutor or guardian, on the other hand, sh'ould correspond regularly with the Political Aide-de-Camp to^he Secretary of State. These instructions do not apply to references to an absent Ruling Prince or Chief regarding the current-business .of the State.12. The direction contained in paragraph 3, that the guardian of a minor Prince or Chief whose State is under adminis- Foreign and Political Depart- shouId « , ™ d ? r . aS ment letter No. F.684-P;33, dated subordinate to the Political (Jincer in cliarge, 24th January 1934. governs the case of a minor Euler while in India. W hen a minor Prince or Chief is sent to England for education or similar puipcses, the tutor or guardian selected for him shall be directly responsible to the authorities in India for sanction of all detailed arrangements, including the control of expenditure. The tutor or guardian should, howevtr, place himself in touch with the India Office on taking up his duties in England and also keep the Political Aide-de-Camp there fully informed of the anangen ents made. The Political Offcer ofthe State should communi cate with the Euler or his guardian through the Government of India, though there is no objection, in questions of urgency, to his sending direct to the Euler or guardian copies of important con n,unications which he is making through the Government of India. These instructions do not apply to references to an absent Euling Prince or Chief regar ding the current business of the State.169 APPENDIX X. Procedure to be observed in connection with the transfer of the services of a Government officer to another Government office or department. 1. It is the duty of a Government officer, who wishes to transfer his services to a different Gov ernment office or department, to obtain the consent of the authority which appoints to his existing post before taking up the i ew employment. If he takes up the new employn ent without such consent, he commits a breach of uiscipline and is liable to be punished, in the last resource, by dismissal from his former post and consequent loss of pensionable servk e. Resignation of his former appointment will not, -it should be noted, protect him from this penalty. 2. In granting or withholding consent to the ac ceptance by a subordinate of other Govei nment employment, the head of an office or department must consider whether the transfer will be consistefft with the interests of the public service. Permis sion should not be refused, however, without strong reason, which should be recorded in writing. 3. The head of an efffee or department shall not employ, either temporarily or permanently, an officer whom he knows, or has reason to believe, to belong to another establishment, without the previous con sent of the head of the office or department in which he is employed. In the-rare case in which for reasons which appear satisfactory to the new T employer an officer cannot obtain the required consent before taking up the new appointment, the employment may be made conditional on consent being obtained at the earliest opportunity. 4. The foregoing instructions apply equally to officers on leave, whether with or without allowances. All leave allowances must ipso facto cease on the taking up of new employment, other than wcik of a purely casual nature.

Certificate of Approval. 2. No prospecting licence or mining lease shall be granted except to a person who is either a subject of the Darbar or who holds a certificate of approval from the Government of India or a Local Government or of the Indian State of which he is a subject. 3. Every application for a prospecting licence or a mining lease shall contain a certified copy of the applicant’s certificate of approval. 4. Leases previously granted under these rules may continue to be held by a grantee after the expiry of his certificate of approval. Part II.—Prospecting Licences. 5. A licence to prospect for minerals or mineral oil, called hereinafter a prospecting licence, shall confer on the licensee the sole right, subject to the con ditions contained in the licence, to mine, quarry, bore, dig and search for, win, work and carry away any mineral or mineral oil lying or being within, under or throughout the land specified in the licence. 6. Every application for a prospecting licence shall be made to— Every such application shall contain the following particulars, namely,— v (a) The name, profession and residence of the applicant, if he is an individual; or if the HIVD206 applicant is a company, syndicate, part nership or private firm, its name and nature and place of business, and if the place of business is outside India, the name and residence of a member or duly authorised agent' resident in India. (b) A description, illustrated by a map or plan, showing as accurately, as possible the situation, boundaries and area of the land with respect to which the licence is re quired. 7. The Darbar may declare in respect of any specified area that in lieu of presenting an application containing the particulars required in rule 6 above, the applicant for a prospecting licence shall adopt the procedure set forth below, or such modification there of as the Darbar may prescribe. Q) He shall, before forwarding his applica tion to the Darbar, demarcate the area applied for in the following method :— (а) At every angle or corner of each boun- 4 dary line, or as near thereto as is prac ticable, he shall fix pegs of substantial material, standing not less than 2 feet above the surface of the ground, and being not less than 3 inches square or 3 inches in diameter. (б) If pegs be not obtainable, he may use instead cairns of stones or mounds of earth, having in each case a height of not less than 2 feet and a diameter at the base of not less than 2 feet. (c) The direction of the boundary line on each side of each peg, cairn or mound shall be indicated with reasonable care by a trench having a length of 4 feet and a breadth and deapth of not less than 6 inches : provided that if trenches cannot be conveniently cut, the direction of the boundary lines shall be indicated by finger posts, or in any other manner suitable for the purpose.(d) The pegs, cairns or mounds shall bear or have affixed thereto some distinguish ing marks which shall be described in the application. (e) In the case of an application for land on the sea-shore, it shall not be necessary to mark out the land below high-water level. (/) No peg, cairn, mound, or other mark employed in marking out the land appli ed for shall be removed or defaced after the application shall have been filed, without the permission of the Darbar. (2) The application shall contain the following particulars, viz .— (а) The name, profession and residence of the applicant, if he is an individual; or if the applicant is a company, syndicate, partnership or private firm, its name, and nature and place of business, and if the place of business is outside India, the name and residence of a member or duly authorised agent resident in India. (б) A description, as accurate as possible, and illustrated by a sketch of the situa tion, boundaries and area of the land with respect to which the licence is required. (c) A description of the distinguishing mark on the pegs, cairns or mounds construct ed to mark out the boundaries of the concession applied for. (d) The date of marking out the concession applied for. 8. In the case of two or more applications affect ing the same land, the prior right to a licence shall be deemed to lie with the applicant who being either208 a subject of the Darbar or the holder of a valid cer tificate of approval and after compliance with the procedure prescribed by the rules, shall have been the first to file his application. 9. Every applicant shall, before the licence is granted, deposit, as security in respect of such licence, a sum of Rs. 100 per square mile or part of a square mile of the area covered by the licence, or shall give security to a like amount. 10. Subject to such deduction on account of com pensation for surface damage, penalty or otherwise as the Darbar may order, the amount of any deposit made under the foregoing rule, should the depositor afterwards be granted a mining lease, will be carried to his credit as part of the rents, royalties or deposit money payable under the lease. Or should he decline to receive or fail to obtain any such lease as aforesaid, the amount will be returned to him on his satisfying the Darbar that the condition in rule 12 (vii) has been complied with and on his furnishing the Darbar with the information required by rule 15. 11. If a licence is not executed within three months after leave has been granted for it, the right of the applicant to such licence shall be held to have lapsed, unless the Darbar for special reasons con sents to grant the same notwithstanding the delay or considers that the delay is not attributable to the applicant. 12. Every prospecting licence shall contain such conditions as may in any particular case seem necessary, and shall in all cases contain the following conditions :— (i) In the case of minerals other than natural petroleum the term for which the licence shall be granted shall be one year or such shorter term as the applicant may desire. The licence may be renew ed for a further term not exceeding two years, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Darbar that a longer period than one year is required in order to enable the licensee to complete his search of209 the land : in the case of natural pe troleum the license shall be granted for two 1 years in the first instance or such shorter term as the applicant may de sire, and may be further renewed by the Collector for one year at a time up to a total period of five years from the date of commencement of the original license. Provided that, when the licensee has, before the termination of the period of the licence, applied for the grant of a min ing lease, the period of the licence may be further extended until a mining lease is granted. (n) The licensee shall pay a fee not exceeding one rupee, and not less than one anna, per acre of the land covered by the licence for each year or portion of a year of the term for which the license is granted. When a licence is renewed under the last foregoing condition, a fresh fee shall be payable, subject to the same maximum and minimum charge, for each year or part of a year for which the licence is renewed. But no fee shall be payable for an ex tension of the term of licence under the proviso to that condition. (in) The licensee shall pay royalty at a rate not exceeding 15 per cent of the value on all precious stones won and carried away, and a royalty at the rates specified in Schedule A in Part IV of these rules on all other minerals won and carried away over and above such quantity as is allowed in Sche dule B to be taken free for purposes of experiment. (tv)_The licensee shall make and pay such reasonable satisfaction and compen sation, as may be assessed by lawful authority in accordance with the law in force on the subject applying to the MlFDlands over which the licence has been granted, for all damage, injury or dis turbance which may be done by him in exercise of the powers granted by the licence, and shall indemnify the Darbar against all claims which may be made by third parties in respect of any such damage, injury or disturb ance. (v) The licensee may, with the previous sanc tion of the Darbar, assign his licence or transfer any right or interest there under to a subject of the Darbar or other person holding a valid certificate of approval subject to the condition that every such assignment or trans fer shall, within three calendar months from the date of its completion, be registered on payment of a fee of rupees fifty. (vi) In case of any breach on the part of the licensee or his transferee or assignee of any of the preceding clauses, the Darbar may summarily revoke the licence, and thereupon all rights con ferred thereby or enjoyed thereunder shall cease; or may in lieu thereof declare to be forfeited the whole or any part of the deposit made by the licensee under rule 9. Ivii) Save in the case of land over which the licensee shall have been granted a mining lease on or before the determi nation of the licence, he shall, within six months next after the determina tion of the licence or the date of the abandonment of the undertaking, whichever shall first occur, securely plug any bores and fill up or fence any holes or excavations that he may have made in the land to such extent as the Darbar may require, and shall to thelike extent restore the surface of the land and all buildings thereon which he may have damaged in the course of prospecting : Provided that the licensee shall not be com pelled to restore the surface of land or any buildings in respect of which full and proper compensation has already been paid under condition (iv). (viii) Should any question or dispute arise regarding the licence or any matter or thing connected therewith or the powers of the licensee thereunder, or the amount or payment of the fee or royalty made payable thereby, the matter in difference shall be referred to arbitration. 13. On or before the determination of his licence the licensee shall have a right to a mining lease in accordance with the terms contained in the rules for mining leases. 14. Such lease may include so much land, com prising the whole or a part only of the area for which the prospecting licence was granted, as shall not ex ceed the area specified with respect to mining leases in rule 19. 15. If so required by the Darbar, the licensee shall, before the deposit made under rule 9 is re turned to him, disclose confidentially to the Darbar all information acquired in the course of the opera tions carried on under the licence regarding the mine rals contained in, or the geological formation of, any area not taken up by him under a mining lease. Part III. —Mining Leases. 16. Every application for the grant of a mining lease shall be accompanied by a deposit, as security in respect of preliminary expenses, of such sum, not exceeding Rs. 500, as the Darbar may determine. If the application relates to an area for which the212 applicant holds a prospecting licence, any amount held in deposit under rule 9 in respect of such pros pecting licence will be carried to his account. The amount of any deposit made under rule 9, less any expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Darbar, will, if the depositor be granted a mining lease, be carried to his credit, as part of the rent or royalties payable under the lease, or if he declines or fails to obtain any such lease as aforesaid, will be returned to him. 17. Every application for a mining lease shall contain the following particulars :— (a) the name, residence and profession of the applicant if he is an individual, or if the applicant is a company, syndicate, pri vate firm or partnership, its name and nature and place of business, and if the place of business is outside India, the name and residence of a member or duly authorised agent resident in India ; (b) a specification of the mineral or minerals for which the applicant intends to mine ; (c) a description, illustrated by a map or plan, showing as accurately as possible the situation, boundaries and area of the land with respect to which the lease is required ; (d) a statement showing all areas within the jurisdiction of the Darbar already held by the applicant or by any person joint in interest with him in prospecting or min ing right; (e) the period for which the lease is required. 18. In the case of two or more applications affecting the same land and presented by applicants who are not in possession of, or have not applied for, prospecting licences in respect thereof the prior right to a lease shall ordinarily be deemed to lie with the applicant who, being either a subject of the Darbar or the holder of a valid certificate of approval and213 after compliance with the procedure prescribed by the rules, shall have been the first to file his applica tion. * 19. On receipt of the application, the Darbar will, if the applicant is entitled to a lease under rule .13, or if they consider that the applicant should be granted a mining lease grant the same in accordance with these rules over such area as they may think fit, but no mining lease will be granted by the Darbar under these rules so as ordinarily to cause the total area held under mining lease for minerals of whatso ever kind other than natural petroleum by the lessee or by those joint in interest with him to exceed ten square miles within the territories administered by the Darbar. Provided that in the case of natural petroleum the Local Government shall not grant to any one lessee or those joint in interest with him leases for any area exceeding 150 square miles within the terri tories administered by it. 20. If a lease is not executed within six months after leave has been granted for it, the right of the applicant to such lease shall be held to have lapsed, unless the Darbar for special reasons consents to grant the same notwithstanding the delay or con siders that the delay is not attributable to the appli cant. 21. The length of an area held under a mining lease shall not be allowed to exceed four times its breadth ; but this rule may be relaxed in the case of areas in river beds held on lease for dredging pur poses. 22. The boundaries below the surface of all areas given out on mining lease under these rules shall be considered to run vertically downwards towards the centre of the earth. 23. The term for which a mining lease may be granted shall not exceed 30 years, but the lease may contain a clause permitting renewal for a period not exceeding 30 years, on a dead and surface rent not exceeding twice the original dead and surface rent214 respectively, the royalty payable being that which may on the day next following that on which the original lease shall determine, be in force under the orders of competent authority ; in the case of iron- ore the original lease may also contain a clause per mitting a second renewal for a further period not exceeding 30 years on a dead and surface rent not exceeding twice the dead and suiface rent respectively fixed for the first renewal of the lease, the royalty payable being that which may on the day next follow ing that on which the first renewal shall determine be in force under the orders of competent authority. 24. Every mining lease shall contain such condi tions and stipulations as the Darbar may in each case consider necessary; and shall in every case contain the following conditions, namely :— {i) The lessee shall pay a royalty or royalties at the rate specified in the lease which rate or rates shall be those fixed for the particular mineral or minerals in Sche dule A in Part IV of these rules ; and if any other mineral shall be discovered by him, then the royalty shall be paid there for at such rate not being less than 20 per cent, of the value thereof, as the Darbar may determine, until a mining lease has been obtained in respect of such mineral; but the lessee shall be entitled within twelve months from the discovery of such mineral to require and obtain such lease for the term then unexpired of his original lease ; provid ed that, if he declines to take a lease as &amp;bove provided, the Darbar may give a lease in respect of such mineral to any other person. (ii) The lessee shall also pay for every year after the first year a fixed yearly dead215 rent at a rate not less than that laid down in Schedule C in Part IV of these rules ; provided that no lessee shall pay both royalty and dead rent in respect of the same lease, but only such one of them as may be of the greater amount, and provided further in the case of leases for iron-ore that when a lessee is granted more than one such lease he may, if he so desire, claim that for the purpose of determining whether royalty or dead rent is payable, all such leases granted to him shall be treated as one concession. In that event he shall be liable to pay dead rent only when the sum of the royalties paid by him in res pect of such leases for the year is less than the sum of the dead rents assessed under those leases or is less than such other amount as the local Government, having regard to the circumstances of the case, may fix as the combined dead rent in respect of all the leases ; and the amount of dead rent so payable shall be the amount by which the sum of the royalties paid for the year falls short of the sum of the dead rents or the combined dead rent so determined. (Hi) The lessee shall also pay for all land which he may take up, use or occupy for the purposes of the mine a surface rent at the rate specified in Schedule D. (iv) The lessee shall at his own expense erect and at all times maintain and keep in repair boundary marks and pillars according to the demarcation to be shown in a plan annexed to his lease. (t?) The lessee shall make and pay such reason able satisfaction and compensation, as may be assessed bylawful authority in accordance with the law in force on the subject applying to the lands over which the lease has been granted, for all216 damage, injury or disturbance which may be done by him in exercise of the powers granted by the lease, and shall indemnify the Darbar against all claims which may be made by third parties in respect of any such damage, injury or disturbance. (vi) The lessee shall not cut or injure any tree reserved in the lease. (vii) The lessee may with the previous sanction of the Darbar assign his lease or transfer any right or interest thereunder either to a subject of the State or to a person holding a valid certificate of approval subject to the condition that every such assignment or transfer shall within three calendar months from the date of its completion be registered on payment of a fee of rupees fifty. (viii) Unless good cause exists for exemption from this condition, a question on which the decision of the Local Govern ment shall be final, the lessee shall com mence operations within one year from the date of the execution of the lease and shall thereafter carry them on effectually in a proper, skilful and mining-like manner. Should the lessee cease without such cause to work the mine for a period exceeding two years in such a manner as to produce sufficient mineral to earn a royalty at least equal to the dead rent, it shall be deemed a breach of this condition. Note,—F or the purpose of the first part of this condition, such measures as the erection of mac hinery for the purposes of working the mine, although not necessarily on the land covered by the lease, or the construction of roads or tramways in connection with the mine, shall be deemed to be sufficient compliance with the requirement of commencing operations. (tx) The lessee shall keep correct accounts showing the quantity and particulars of217 all minerals obtained from the mine and the number of persons employed there in, and also complete plans of the mine, and shall allow any officer authorised by the Darbar in that behalf at any time to examine such accounts and plans, and shall furnish the Darbar with such infor mation and returns in respect of the aforesaid matter as it may prescribe. (x) The lessee shall allow existing and future licence, or lease-holders of any land, which is comprised in or adjoins or is reached by the land held by the lessee, reasonable facilities of access thereto. (xi) The lessee shall allow any officer authoris ed by the Darbar in that behalf to enter upon the premises comprised in the lease for the purpose of inspecting the same. (xn) The lessee shall without delay report to the Darbar the discovery on or within any of the lands or mines demised by the lease of any mineral not specified in the lease. (xih) The Darbar shall have the right of pre emption, at current market rates, over all minerals demised by the lease. (xiv) Should the royalty or rent reserved or made payable by the lease be not paid within two months next after the date fixed in the lease for payment of the same, the Darbar may enter upon the said premises and distrain all or any of the minerals or movable property there in, and may order the sale of the pro perty so distrained or so much of it as will suffice for the satisfaction of the rent or royalty due and all costs and ex penses occasioned by the non-payment thereof ; and, if any royalty or rent218 remain at any time unpaid for six calen dar months after the date on which it is due, the Darbar may determine the lease and take possession of the premises comprised therein. (xv) In case of any breach on the part of the lessee of any covenant or condition contained in the lease, the Darbar may determine the lease and take possession of the said premises ; or, in the alterna tive, may accept payment of a penalty, not exceeding twice the amount of the annual dead rent, from the lessee. (xvi) At the end or sooner determination of the lease, the lessee shall deliver up the said premises and all mines (if any) dug therein in a proper and workman-hke state, save in respect of any working as to which the Darbar may have sanc tioned abandonment. (xvii) Should any question or dispute arise regarding the lease or any matter or thing connected with the mines and minerals leased or the working or non working thereof or the amount or pay ment of the royalty or rent reserved or made payable by the lease, the matter in difference shall be referred to arbi tration. 25. The lessee shall be at liberty to determine the lease at any time on giving not less than twelve calendar months’ notice in writing to the Darbar: and upon the expiration of such notice, provided that all sums due on account of the lease shall have been paid the lease shall be determined. When a lessee exercises his option of determining a lease, he shall not, except with the previous sanction of the Gov ernor General in Council, be granted subsequently a new lease over a portion only of the land covered by the original lease.219 Part IV. —Rents and Royalties.
