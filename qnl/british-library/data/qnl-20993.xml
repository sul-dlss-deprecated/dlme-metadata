Despatch Secret M A M , dated the 8th December 1925, from the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, London. By order Under Hesident in the Persian Gulf.3 . Copy of a Despatch Secret 'A M , dated the 8th December 1925, from The Acting High Commissioner for * Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, London. In continuation of my telegram No. 639, dated the 4th of December 1925, I have the honour to report that Sir Gilbert Clayton arrived in Baghdad on the morning of jth* November the 30th and handed me a copy of his complete report of the Bahra AgxKBmxHX negotiations, together with a signed copy of the Bahra Agreement. I forwarded the latter to the Prime Minister with the request that steps may be taken to secure its ratification at an early date. I also forwarded to him copies of the papers numbered 2, 3 and 4 in Annexure 14 to Sir Gilbert Clayton’s Report, namely Taufiq Beg Suwaidi’s report regarding the conversation between himself and the Najd delegate in connection with the liquidation of past raids, Sir Gilbert Clayton’s letter to Ibn Saud on the same subject, and Ibn Saud ’ s reply .£1 i*xjex Ilol The only Arabic copies of these documents having been forwarded by Sir Gilbert Clayton to the Colonial Office I did not consider it advisable to have them re-translated into Arabic, but forwarded them in English. I should be grateful if I could be favoured, as early as possible, with copies of the Arabic versions that are in your possession. 2. Sir Gilbert Clayton had interviews with His Majesty King Faisal and with the Council of Ministers. Both His Majesty and the Cabinet expressed themselves as thoroughly satisfied with the terms of the Bahra Agreement, and exceedingly grateful for the able manner in which Sir Gilbert Clayton conducted the negotiations on their behalf. Parliament is due to reassemble on December the 20th, and no difficulty is anticipated in securing its approval to the ratification of the agreement by His Majesty.2 3. The Agreement is, from the ’Iraq point of view, thoroughly satisfactory, and the ’Iraq Government have every reason to he grateful to Sir Gilbert Clayton for the skilful diplomacy which enabled him to secure a favourable settlement of all the important points which the Kuwait Conference failed to decide. It now depends upon the ’Iraq Government more, I think, than upon Ib&amp;n Saud, to see that the terms of the agreement are lyyally sxxxxx&amp;xbb* observed. The establishment of cordial relations between the ruler of Najd and any son of the ex^King of the Hijaz can scarcely be looked for in the immediate future, but I see no reason to suppose that His Majesty King Faisal will not subordinate his natural feelings of filial resentment to the ttue interests of the country over which he rules. The conoperation of the present Cabinet may be safely counted upon. 3. The first necessity for the implementing of the Bahra Agreement is the establishment of more expeditious means of communication with Ibn Saud than those that now exist. I have carefully examined the correspondence ending with the Duke of Devonshire’s telegram Ho. 210, dated the 30th of April 1923, on the subject of the substitution of the Honourable the Resident in the Persian Gulf for the High Commissioner in Baghdad as the medium of communication between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Sand, and I can find nothing therein to suggest that it was the intention of His Majesty’s Government that direct correspondence between the High Commissioner and Ibn Saud on purely ’Iraq affairs should cease. Whatever the intention of His Majesty’s Government may have been, the fact remains that, since the departure of Sir Percy Cox on leave in the Spring of 1923 direct correspondence between the High Commissioner in Baghdad and Ibn Saud has ceased. No good purpose appears to have served in the past by this discontinuance of direct3 direct relations between 'Iraq and Najd, and in at least one instance, namely that of the camels looted from the Dhafir in June last, which it now appears that Ibn Saud has been for some months ready and anxious to return, consider- -able delay and confusion has resulted. It is essential that direct relations should now be re-established, and I hope that I may receive your telegraphic authority to communicate to Ibn Saud through His Britannic Majesty's representative at Jiddah the ratification of the Bahra Agreement, as soon as it has been effected, and in future to correspond direct with Ibn Saud, by the most expeditious means at my disposal, in all matters of detail affecting his relations with the 'Iraq Government ana the steps to be taken to implement the agreements in force between the Governments of Najd and Iraq. The correspondence will usually pass through His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Jiddah or the Political Agent at Bahrain or Kuwait, accord- -ing to the whereabouts of Ibn Saud, and copies of corres- -pondence will be sent to the Resident at Bushire and to the Colonial Office for information. As I have stated above, I cannot discover that it was ever the intention of His Majesty’s Government that direct correspondence bwtween 'Iraq and Najd should cease, but it has ceased for so long that it appears necessary that Ibn Saud should be informed of your approval to its resumption. I request therefore that, should you approve my proposal, you will be good enough to intimate your approval to Ibn Saud as well as to myself as early as possible. 5. This step will not, however, in my opinion, be enough to secure a satisfactory solution of frontier tribal difficulties. In the case of both Persia and Syria it was found that, when dealing with minor frontier troubles, correspondence between the central Governments was too dilatory a method to secure satisfactory results, and a systemsystem of dieect correspondence between the frontier officials of 1 Iraq and those of Persia and Syria respect- -ively has been introduced with very satisfactory results. Similar correspondence has evfcfin very minor cases, proved effective in settling incidents on the Turkish frontier. I hope that it may eventually be possible to induce Ibn Saud to agree to the introduction of a similar system as between ’Iraq and Hajd. Such a system would not be in conflict with Article 5 of the Bahra Agreement which refers not to correspondence between subordinate officials of the two Governments but to correspondence between the central Government on one side and subordinate officials olt chiefs on the other. Ibn Saud is exceedingly chary of deputing any powers to his subordinate commanders, and the question will have to be tackled with care, out Sir Gilbert Clayton, with whom I have had the advantage of discussing it, and who expressed his complete agreement with my views, cons id- -ers that there should be no great difficulty in eventually securing Ibn Saud’s agreement to an informal agreement of this nature. 6.

I regret the action of the Iraq Government in vliese days as it is a breach of* the agreements between us for tlie preservation of oeaco and order. V/e see in each incident a proof of the lack of good intent of the Iraq Government and we give a number of recent happenings from which you can understand the situation. Tlie refugee Chamnar tribes used to raid bejd territory and we protested to the High Commissioner. About ITovember last year tlie High Commissioner warned us that a party of fhammar had left Iran and were gathering in the Syrian desert with the intention of raiding our tribes. A s raiding tribes cannot enter our territoty ** without passing across the territory of Trans- Jordan or Iran we protested against the Iraq Government and asked for the prevention of such incidents. Tlie High '-'on-’issioner sent no rerlv to our protest. Ten months later the Iraq Government began to -build military dog ts at tf^ '..ells near t ie _ ronti or and s d read a rumour ^ of t*&gt;e Ajair Protocol of the l 0 th n&lt;a v i al that those places would be joined ut&gt; by rai Iwav and become strong fortresses on our frontier. This action had the worst effect among the IJejd tribes and as it was centrery to articleTils High Commiesion^r neglectto reply to flic prot-et but rerlied only to our flrct protect -regarding tlie movo of tbo Sl annar f roe Iraq to Syria.

You can see teat these fortress posts are far from the road by which the refugees had gone to Syria. The Hejdir cry that the posts wore erected only as a provocation. 'a again protested tg the High Commissioner on °tth Rabi al 'V.val and explained tbat the buildings were contrary to the agreements and that they were causing intense excitement. To received no reply to our letter. On reaching Riadli we saw clearly the rage among our fronti.er tribes and fiiat it was difficult to keep or her on tire excited fronti er. 1Fr e wrote from Riadli to the High Commissioner on the 10th Jamad- al A.wal informing him of the state of affairs and follov:ed this with anotlier letter dated 12th Jamd al Awal but stllj. no reely came.

We see in each incident that takes place betv/een us and them a proof that it was not don with good intention by the Iraq Government and I give in de tail a number of recent incidents from which you can under stand the real situation between us both. The Shamar tribes who too* refuge in Iraq used to raid on the Hejd. frontier and we have protested against ouch raids at that time. I do not want to repeat in full the details of what happened. After some time the High Com missioner for Iraq warned us that a party of Shamar had left Iraq and were gathering in the Syrian desert with the intention of raiding our tribes in our country Nejd.Tnis was about the month of .November of last year. ’4e took this action to be contrary to the agreements for the prevention of Hgxjtnmnndt raids as the raiding tribe cannot enter our territory without entering either tha boundaries of Trans- Jordania or. Iraq. x .v’e protested against the Iraq Government for allowing this and asked for the prevention of such inci dents. But the High Commissioner for Iraq ^ept quiet and did not reply to our protest at all. However, after ten months of our protest the Iraq Government began to build military stations at the wells and places near the frontier and spread the rumour that they were going to join up those places by railway lines and will then make them strong mi litary fortresses on our boundaries whereas Article III of Aqair Protocal of 12th Rabi 11,1341 does not allow any building at the wells and stations near the frontier. We protestedprotested against this action which had th® worst effect among the Nejd tribes and caused undescribabie excitement and rage. We sent our above mentioned protest to the High Commissioner for Iraq on ^th habi I 1346 but the High Commissioner neglected to reply to this protest of ours and replied only to our first protest against the egress of the Shamar from Iraq to Syria with the inten tion of raiding our country. He said that as it is the intention of the Iraq Government to take precautions for the prevention of the going out of such raiders they have established tnem (i.e.posts) on the frontier adjoining Hejd territory, which as you can see are far from the road from v/hich the run away nave come to Syria ana has relation with that (road). The number of fortressus nas been mentioned in his letter v/hich we received in August 1927, No.y^63, while the erection of such fortresses iu forbidden in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. All the Nejd peo ple have seen that they y/ere erected for the purpose of causing discord and. harm. Again we wrote to the High Commissionerrepeating our protest against the action of the Iraq Government on the 2*th Pabi I 1346 and explained to His Excellency in that letter the degree in which the erection of such buildings and stations is contrary to the previous agreement and the excitement and disturbance which this action caused at Hejd but we did not receive a reply to our letter. But on reaching our Nejd capital (Hiyadh) we saw clearly the extreme agitation and rage among our tibeo living near the frontier, on account of that action. I found that the situation has become very critical so that it was very difficult to keep order on the excited frontier. Again we wrote to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq from Riyadh on 10th Jamad 1..46 informing of the stateSo state of affairs and I followed tills with another lette on 12th Jamaa I 1546 but although we did tnis no reply came from the High Commissioner to all our repeated protests ana we could not see any good reason for his seeping cuiet. The longer the silence lasted the more critical became the situation and the more the disquie tude increased and it betoame more difficult to deal with it or rather it became impossible to preserve ^eace and order on the frontier between us and them. I have written this to you on account of your proximity to us, with the request that you will commu nicate to the British Government, our strongest protest against the action of the Iraq Government, as we want p KHKH to preserve peace and friendly relations between us and the British Governiacnt.

After Compliment b. We are in receipt of your letter Ho. 128.C of 2Snd Jamad al Aval 1846 conveying a meGcage Gent by the Hon’bio the Political Resident to us, in which he states that ii.ii.M’s ciovernnont were astonished at the recent incident at Busaiyah. We roquoGt you to telegraph to him (the P.R. ) that we were more astonished and regret very much its occurrence. We have issued orders for enquiries about the people who had done it and for their punishment. At the same time we have issued orders for a stricter watch on the frontier and have taken all the necessary steps to prevent any further action until the end of the correspondence regarding this evil omened fort which has been erected only for purposes of intrigue and for causing troubles. As regards the compensation referred to in the letter it is a trifling thing which is not worthy of causirg a dispute between us and the British Govern ment. But before di scussing this natter we wont to invite the attention of the just British Government to the matter of the responsibility and on whom it falls in this case, whether on us or the Iraq Government? A second thing. This case should be compared with the others like it which liave talien place between Iraq, Trans-Sordinia and Nejd and Hejaz. For when the responsibility is faced and t-ie matter is compared with the previous incidents the compensation can be fixed. We - and we believe thatthat the juctice of BritiEii Governnent will oupport Gg - g 90 that the roEponeibility falls on the Iraq Government ae they alone had oausod thi b incident. We havealready warned the Iraq Government of the bad reeultE which may follow on their behaviour towards ue. But the only reply wac silence or procaGtination or lame explanationc. The Hon'ble the Political Resident on referring to our letter of ^Oth Jamad al Awal 1*43 = S^th November 1927 will obocerve the difficultieG and troubles which the Iraq Government have cauEed and are caueing to give riee to a dispute between ug and theriEGlveE and in addition to that to cause trouble betv/eon ug and the BritiEh Government. When one look at all the actions of the Iraq Government towards us one will not see that they are the actions of a friendly neighbour to one in treaty with them but the spirit of an enemy will be seen and rather you can say that they are a breach in of the Epirit of peace. I give a detail a chain of actionE done by them (Iraq) in these days from which you can understand their real situation and it will make clearer to H.B.M’s Government the responsibility for the recent incidents 1. The High Comnissloner for Iraq warned ue that a raiding party of Shannar were collecting in Syria to raid our country and that the Iraq Government were not r^sponEible for this action. I protested as the raiders were bound to pass on their way to our country either through the territoty of Trans- Jordania or Iraq and asked that the resDonsibility of the same may be borne either by the Iraq Govern ment or Trans-Jordan!a but the reply wae as I have informed11 informed the HOn’ble the Political Resident in ray above mentioned letter - a silence for about 10 months without a reply. Then came a reply but in a very strange way as he made our protest a means of breaking the protocol entered into at Ujair with the Iraq by building a number of forts for our protection and for preventing raiders from raiding us. The Wojd people would be cleased if the Iraqis raided them every morning and evening but they do not agree to the building of one metre on the waters and the places on which, building has been prohibited by an official document. These places are visited by then and are their watering places as well as places of visit and watering for others than then. Trouble broke out in Nojd on account of this building in the manner I described to the Hon’ble the Political Resident. £. Tlie Iraq Government were not satisfied with this the sort of breach but began to interfere with thw chiefs of our tribes and called them to attend its meetings (conferences). This is totally prohibited by the provisions of the treaties entered into at Ujair and Bahrah. An example of thisis a letter from the Mutasaarrif of Duvraniyah to Maharamod al Turki bin Mijlad and Jaza bin Mjlad asking them to look into the claims relating to the plunder of the tribes. We have protested against this action in a letter which we sent to the *iigh Commissioner for Iraq dated 1st Rabi al Awal but no reply has been received from the High Commissioner up to this hour and we cannot understand the cause for this neglect. *. Tlie motor cars of the Iraq Government officials and also some aeroplanes are always going as far as the frontier and nix with our Arabs. This is done with the intention of having an effect on our tribesmen either to persuade them to commit an act which will causecaUBO cllGBenGion botw^on neigbhourG or for Gone othor roaBon of which wo cannot goo the justification. 4 . TI'Ogo who study gopo of the Iraq UowspanorG especially the papers connected with the High Officials of the Iran Government will Gee from the attacks and insults afrainst ug and our Government g?iow indications of the amount of hatred and hidden (bad) feeling. From this you will see that the Irai Government have broken our treaty first by allowing her official to comunicate with «eu our subjects and by allowing their officials to visit our country with their motor cars among our triboe to cause sedition and have broken their promise by building these posts the building of which is not permissible and have shown in their newspapers a condition that leads to the kindlinr of t : &gt;o flame of enmity between the two countries. Who then will be responsible for* all this for the incidents which may be caused b” some of those people whose feelings have been roused. They have seen their self respect dishonoured, their treaties broken and their neighbour waiting for his chance inside those buildings. They went without the consent of the Government. I prvented the Nejd people totally from raiding from the date we entered into treaty for the prevention of the raids and have held them with an iron grip. But raids on us have never been discontinued either by the Iraq or by Trans-Jordania. The Uejd peoule obeyed us with much patience in being prevented be they were respecting the undertaking we have taken to stop raids. But I had no excuse to put before them about this evil omened building. As they had seen the provision of the treaties which prevent such building and that we have prevented them from building such post in similar stations within our territory. We want the British Government to to look with justicejustice on this caso thon they will eee that we are the people who conply with our undertaking and preserve what belong to others.Translation of letter Ho.

Faisal ad Dawish (who is at the root of whole trouble) and fanatic Akhwan regard its existence as a proof of their contention xf ibn Saud has sold his country f s rights to us. They argue that whole of the desert is theirs right up to town and village of Iraq, and that he had no right to agree to any other frontier. Ibn Saud has also summoned Dawish to Biyadh three times since he arrived there, and on each occasion he has refused to go. Ibn Saud has now summoned Ulema of Ikhawan and they are on their way to Riyadh. He thinks that there is little fear of further raid just at present, as Ikhwan will probably wait to see result of conference between Ibn Saud and Ulema, and he has little doubt Ibn Saud will succeed in talking the latter round and making them see reason. If he does, he will have Ikhwan under control again, out if he should fail, he has no/ other means of enforcing his authority. There is no doubt attack on Busaiyah was against Ibn Saud’s wish.

Recent events as follows On November 5th Mutair destroyed Bucaiyah fort and killed police and workmen. At end of November they raided Jahra in Tuwait.

Meanwhile Political circles in -tfughuad and King Faisal sale much e&gt; cited and tendency already perceptible is bound to revive towards accusing us of conniving at attacks by Akhwan tribes in order to remind Mesopotamia of its depend- -ence upon British. ’his may undo excellent effect hitherto apparent, of London negotiations with King Faisal, whose attitude since his return has been admirable. x&amp;xn- Meanwhile Ibn Saud in answer to protests has stated Mutair have acted against his orders and that he intends to punish them but that Mesopotamia and -British are respons- -idle for hostility of Mutair as they have fortified desert posts and patrolled desert with aeroplanes and armoured cars. This argument is obviously unsustainable. I consider our policy should depend upon whether Ibn Saud in next few weeks shows himself really deter- -mined to suppress attacking tribes and capable of doing so. If he fails in either respect I see no remedy except to blockade Hasa ports and force minor Trucial Chiefs on Arab side of Gulf to follow suit, on ground that we see no hope of preventing attacks except by threatening Akhwan tribes into starvation and forcing them to resist Ibn faud . King Faisal argues with some show of reason that Mutair must be assured of Ibn Baud's quiescence and inability to punish them severely otherwise they would never have been so mad as to leave their headquarters, families and property undefended behind them. message I suggest urgent loxanEagitx be now sent to Ibn ^aud recapitulating series of raids both on Mesopotamia and s Kuwait, exposing futility of his arguments about fortification and1% T#X*gr*i» l'. ^roxs ts*43rotary of r.t^# for Um CoXoaits. u&gt;nuun.

Dawish is acting contrary to Ibn Baud’s wishes and thtf latter is Just as anxious for peace on the border at the present time as we are. He is in a very difficult ;.’0 8i ..ion however as he is hated in Hejaz and has enemies in Kejd even among his own family (his brother and nephew were ali.ioB t certainly at the bottom of the plot to murder his son and Ibn Jilawi last sommer), and the people whom he has to rely on most to keep him on his throne are the Ikhwan tribes. Consequently, although he is extremely annoyed with them,he will not dare to try to punish the hutair, particularly in ▼lew of the oath taken by Dawish, Sultan bin Huraaid, Ibn Hi thlain in 1926 mutually to support each other in such a case. Cn the other hand it is probable he will re-establish his authority by persuasian and peaceful means and will then be in a position to keep tribes quiet, at any rate for some time. would be This is what is hoped will happen as anything in better xhan the appalling chaos which would follow revolution in Hejd even if it did remove ban on trade with Kuwait. Meanwhile recent events and success in raid which Dawish has up to the present enjoyed are having a very prejudicial effect on our prestige in Arabia (Irak Government His no prestige and is looked on as a negligible quantity). is argued our areoplanes cannot protect the frontier or Harm raiders. Cur respect for treaties and frontiers is not understood 2 our reason for not retaliating and punishing ^utair by bombing them or their villages is that we cannot ? oror dal?*? nOo. viere vie to take such a course and go right into i:ejd to punish them Ibn r,aud might possibly protest but really he *ould be very pleased. Unless our aircraft have good fortune to get an opportunity to teach them a severe lesson soon, not only will all desert tribes inevit- -ably become Akhwan soon but the movement would probably spread to the Jezireh.

It would not however be as rapid and effective as attacks on ilutair and is open to objection that it would appear to b«? directed against Ibn ‘ : aud himself and not only against his rebellious tribes. I am however still of opinion that this measure should be adopted if those proposed in thiu telegram do not prove effective. Latest news from hejd very conflicting but indicates that Ibn : aud*B measures against Dawish have been checked by threatening attitude of Ataiba tribe. 2f latter combine with ttutair expert opinion holds that Ibn £!aud will be powerless to reduce them by force.

I request you to telegraph to the Hon’ble the' Political Resident to invite the attention of H.B.M*s Government to a point in the matter in question viz if article three merely prohibited the building at ATRAF AL HADUD there would ave been cause for the argument (protest Regarding the measurement of miles metres and etc., but, article three not anl-y prevented the building at ATRAF AL HADuD but it prohibited the building at t'&gt;e waters and wells existing at ATRAF AL HADUD, the following r are the wordings of the article ( Each o*' the two Govts, undertake not to use the waters and the wells existing at ATRAr AL HADUD for any military purpose such as the build ♦ing of forts and no troops should be posted near them ) While Busaiyah and the wells rear it are all situated at ATRA; Au HADUD and there is no argument about it. We beg to offer to the British Government our thanks and gratitude for taking into consideration our point of view in the matter of Bub ai yah fort. We-feel pleased and happy for their appointing the Hon’ble Colone! Haworth the Political Resident in the Perrin Gul x&lt; to discuss with us and try to clear up the misunderstanding which has arisen in this case. We very much ap reciated the desire of t!&gt;e British Government to bring matters to an ubderst .nding. We always endeavour to keep on an understanding with the British Government .UE^resret.however, that it is not(2) poGGib’for tif in the near future to fix a tine for our noeting as we aro not keeping well on account of fck« cold we are now having and cocondly owing to the heavy work now at Najd which we ought to do, and which requires settling and fj.nich.ing up. As regards the information conveyed In the message about the attack ct Dawir.h on al Ghalidli of Bani Hukain near Urbaibah jn the neutral zone, tfis attack war not aginst Iraq and was not I'elt by the Iraq Government but we consider it to be an attack against us and we felt it more than the Iraq Government. The situation in Najd after the recent actionieifof the Iraq Government has changed a great deal and it does not allow us to do all that we want and desire* We will give the reason* here^which want to be conv^y^d to the lion‘bio the Political Re 1 id^n for the information of His Majesty’s Govern^ont so that when a meeting takes place between us and his honour he will be in possession of all the necessary instructions in this patter and their details. do not want to conceal it from you that there 15 no man, woman or child in Najd who was not very much crtficA' disappointed o’-’-ing to the building of Busaiyah^fort^^sw**’ by the Iraq Government• And t e next disappointment ffat folloved it was due to two actions of the Iraq Government* First they (Iraq) welcomed the criminals * ( whom we wanted to puntih on account of Iran Government as they have done in the past in the case of Yusuf ae- Sadun and his HaJ li followers and as they did recently in the case of Bin Mijlad when we pu*i«hed him on account of the Iraq. He ran away to them and they gave him a shelter and offered % hira help. Secondly the coming Of the Iraq officials^and their mixing with our tribes and asking them to run away fr^m our country and instigae •ing them to cause trouble in our country. For this reason the Najd people felt it very much. When we want &amp; send them to punish the Dawish they say * we do not(5) disobey your orders but tlr* Iraqis are the people who cLua^ to punish the Dawieh he would run a.vay to Iraq and there the Iraq people would shelter him, then what have we dort£ ? Tliis the situation at Najd about those who are at XXKAK Al» HADUD# Therefore there are three ways to settle this dispute and we then a cept any responsiblitj which nay arise should the Iran Government carry then ouT regulary. Jbirst aiiticl^ tliree of the orotocal should be observed and the Busaiyah fort to be pull down with others, secondly both parties undertake not to accept any criminal coningb from the country of the other part 3 whatever his crime may be* Third the Iraq Government should undertake to crevent the visit or any motor car aeroplane or nan from mixing with our tribes with intenl -ion of creating trouble and we undertake to obsorve the same. If any agreement is arrived at on these three articles the situation will be nuite cliar and every thing will be settled. We would also be able to punisl the big and small in our country and recover all that they have plundered and make them pay for it and punis them for all that they have done* British Government as premise for he coming meeting* Should this be aggreed upon 1 hope by th^ will of God it will remove all th^ troub]*- 8 ood relations should exist between us and our friendstl HfiS.ii's Government* contravened the agreement.'

After complinontG, We beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.0.14 dated 15th Rajab 1340 ( i.e. 8-1-88 ) in which you comnunicate to us the contente of the telegram you received from the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persim Gulf in which he informs ue of what the British Government had instructed .him to write and inform us. We request you to telegraph to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to inform the British Government of our following reply to (t 1 ieir) telegram The incidents narrated in the telegram about the action of the Dawish of which we disapprove had a bad effect on us and we are not going to let the Dawish, with all those who took part with him go without being punished. We never ourselves declared at any time that we were unable to puAish the Dawish or any others. The Government that has been established in this wide desert, which with its power, brought all forces that are in it under its control and managed its adminstratior by the virtue of the social teachings of the religion, and made all the desert tribes within the lands under our control obey our orders in a manner that cannot be compared with(that of any other Government ) in the world towards nomad tribes and the best proof of this, is the state of peace which is spread all over our king -dora and which makes us to boast and say that there is no similar thing to bo found in any country in the worldj A Government which by its own force made its authority 2 '' i: '11111 I E hfirm in tills vast country and setablished this sort of rule will mvor ba a weak one and unablo to punish the Dawieh and others like him. Nothing has prevented us f o ounibhint-. t u i Jawish at the present time except what we referred to in our several letters which we sent to the British Government. Afe made ontcondition in the 'matter of puijf^hiti^ the Dawish and his followers which wo make clear in Uu* our tic letter viz that the Iraq Government should undertake that when we punish the Dawish and his follow -ers should any of them run away to Iraq either before CLa. we effect the punishment or after it.Iraq Government should undertake to turn him out and object to shelter him. When the Ir$q Government make such an undertaking you will then see how we punish the Dawish and all thosi who took part with him in these actions of which we disapprove, it will be a punishment that, by the grace of God, will prevent them for ever from taking action on the frontier. But if we were to send a force today for their punishment which may or may not catch them (is- and punish them, and then they run av/ay to, Iraq Government and there the Iraq Government accept and welcome them, what will be the result of our punish -nont then. If the Iraq Government undertake to turn them out when they take refuge with them then the present condition of affairs will be altered. With exceedingly great surprise we read that it is the intention of the British Governmwnt to attack with their Military aeroplanes the Hutair tribe at thekkkxxwg places in which they are living in our country and kingdom and punish a party of our subjects in the interior of our country. Will not the British Government see in this action a breach of our independence and an aggression against our nation*! authority which no inter**national law will allow(S) and which ie naver practiced between Governments. This is one point and the second is tliat the correcpond -ance on the subject is not over yet and the third one til is who is going to lead those aeroplanes to those so that they nay punish then crininals/and how can the aeroplanes know if* the criminals are staying with their tr^bes-nen or not and who said that all the Mutair took part in there actions. If, God forbid, the aeroplanes take such action which(we never expect the British Government to take) we would dignify the BritisH Government from taking (they will find) no Mutair tribesmen before then except the innocent who are busy praying to their God, and among them the haby, the old and .helpless man and the women. All these are from among those who had done no fault, and there is no doubt that the human law prevents transgression against them. As reg rds the mention of the Hon’ble the Politica] Resident that the present difficulties will be settled by a meeting and verbal conversation, this is true, and we concur with hie honour. When we find ourselves to £ (m- . have recouped our health and rel&amp;ived of the sicknese A we have we will fix a time for our meeting * or the eettlment of this trouble, within which time his honour will doubtless receive U** full instructions from His Majesty's Government regarding the proposal*-we suggested for the settlement of the present triuble.

We informed the High Commissioner in our letter No.M/^/27 dated the 18th Jamad 1,1M6 (i.e&gt;7-ll-27 ) that the effect on the Najd people especially those who are staying at the frontier has reached its limit on account of the Iraq Government and t?\eir broach of their undertaking regarding building the posts and the interferance of their officials' motor cars with our tribesmen with the intention o“ spoiling them and we were afraid of A such, effect hence we issued our orders for more careful watch at the frontier but in spite of the precautions which wo took we were informed that a few tribesmen intended to go out or that they may have gone out from unknown directtons meaning Busaiyah post to oppose its being built.

Were those tribes in their r ids obeying the orders of the Iran and Tranejoran Govornrentc or not T Host cortianly they were not obey -ing but wsr© disobedient and (acting) against their orders, thus the Iran and Transjordan Ciovern^ont were not able to stop th^n iron their bad action and if they had ' * xaiiiAxxxxx been able to do so th-y would hate done it. But those tribes cane and plundered and then return'd to t their living places euite safely and peacfully and we never heard that any of those tribes was punished for raiding our tribes. Last year we were in 'omed by Hie Excellency the High Connissioner that a party of Shannar who are residing in Iraq went against the orders of the Iraq Governnent and proceeded to the Syrian desert to render vous there with the intehtion of raiding our tribes and that an Irae force supported by a British one war not able to set right that tribe and prevent it frora its bad action. But when we were attached by those mischievous raiders and when we received the letter of His Excellency the High Connirsioner that the Iraothat th» Iraq Gov^rnn-*nt w«r© not abl© to etop the Shaonai tribe w© never explained that the Iraq Gov^rnraent wer© noi able to punish t^eir their tribes and they had no nor© control over thorn neither did we take the right in our hands by reirsulnlng those raiders into the interior of thoir country an l punishing then there* As wo know that what they had done was contrary to the opinion of thier Government• W© can so© no difference between the two situ tione, that of the Iraq Government towrds the raiden of their subjects and our present situation and the attao] of the Dawish and his followers about whom we informed the British Government just as they(British Government) informed us of the movement of Shanmar. However, we were open in our mention of matters which the Irao Government used to keep ouit©We said that we had made a no v, e care -ful watch at the frontier but in spite of such vatch some of the tribesmen had gone out and done what happened without our knowledge. Then we said we did not punish the Dawish for hie action of which we disapprove as we know that the Irao Government welcomes every one whom we punish on thier behalf who goes to them as they did in th case of Yusuf as-Sa*dun and his Najd followers and as the recently did with Bin Mijlad when we ounished him on the! . behalf. We will not punish, th© Dawish unless we get an undertaking that wh^n we punish him the Iran Government undertake not to accept him or any of those who took part with him. The situation in Najd which we explained has got a counterpart in Iraq every day and every hour, but the misunderstanding of the object of our letter is the cause of nows emanating from the British House of Commons and the Chamber of Deputies in Iraq, that there are disturbances and troubles in Najd while there are no disturbances and no trouble . All that happened is that some beduins attacked Iraq tribes Just as A1 Mayiq of the Sharamar residing in Iraq who went out against the (will)Iraq Government ^ attacked the Ehararat tribe at He ( «ayiq) wan accompanied by SO camel-men. He plundered thre ■ lerde (ofoanele) . A eecond time he repeated this action in the company of 18 creator, of'trouble and attack -ed the Shararat and took three other herds. We will write to Hie Excellency the High Commie.ioner and protest against the action of A1 Mayiq, and what is the dif'fereni between the ection of the Mayiq and that of the Dawish. But we took the way of being frank in saying so that we may oome to a firm agreement (understanding ). While our authority over our tribesmen and subjects is regular and complete. It w s never explained in the past that when a raiding party goes out to another country the Government had no authority over its peonle and subjects. The actio: whic - you- informed us of that is that Bfcttish Government intend to send their aeroplanes to the interior of our country :or the punishment of our subj»c+s t is. Just as we said in our letter which we sent previous to this one. ie a now principlo which no Govomnont law will accopt. i And If the British Gov^rnnont find it an accepted principl an agreenont should ho reached before it is carried out and then this system will be adopted that should any raiders go to another country and th^n return/to their own country), then the raided Government will have the rig 1 it to persue the criminals within their own country and punish them in it. When we adopt such an agreement and accept it then the situation will be c^antred. These are our details which we put before the British Government and liope by them part of the mi sunder -standing may be cleared.^ Translation of letter No. lifa/'d/x/z? dated 28tli Rajab 1546= 21-1-£8 fron Hie Uajeflty Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman al-Faisal-as-Sa f ud,G.C.I.E., King of Hijaz,Najd and D?pendancieG to H.B.M'e Political Agent, Bahrain.

OCMYSRSATIOy BETWKK H OOtmr.l.;U.QR AKD SHAlIg HATIJH WAHBA OM THE 6TH OF JANUARY, me. H.E. In aoooraancc witn your instructiona I interyiewea H&amp;fidh tji/iftiib*, yesterday and int'ormed him of our plans for operation against the kutair# I made no mention of any ' 3 * 1 * 1 $* question of employing the ^raq /iriiy. Lhaiich Hafidh as-tced me whether we were obtaining Ion Sa , ud , s approval to our operations* I replied th&amp;t f apart from the necessity for s immediate action# it seemed to me that a request for I bn Sa^d* UW consent to the operations would be embarrasL^e. considerably* While he might in his heart of hearts welcome them# it was clearly impossible for him officially to agree to them* It seemed to me better for us to go ahead in the hope that the operations might really prove helpful to I bn Sa^d as *.ell as to Uraq# although we should expect to receive an official protest from him. He then suggested that we might# in our message to Ibn Sa’ud# mention a date on which operations would begin and fix that date in such a way as to give Ibn Sa^d time to receive our message before our operations actually commenced. He told me that a message can be sent from iCuwait to hiyadh# where Ibn ba f ud is ana where ne is likely to re* main# in six days. I said that although wo were very anxious not to embarrass Ibn ba'ud we hau at the same tim&gt;. a clear duty to the 'Iraq Government and must taxe immediate steps to stop the Mutair raiding and reassure the 'Iraq tribes. He said he quite realised this and thought that the action we proposed taxing might be effective in punisuing the llut&amp;ir and in preventing them from raiding! although he pointed out that the Uutair are in a state of exalted religious fanaticism and whatever have no fear/of death* At the same time he felt sure that it would do great harm to Ibn Sa'ud# as all of his tribes would be &amp;ngry with him and would accuse him of calling in *inf iuelc» to2 So3 to kelp nxm Against ’true belitsTor#* f Ho wo&amp;t on to Bc^ tk&amp;t one reason which operatou to aeter Ibn £u*ud from suppreBsmg I’eisal al by l oroe wab hib fear that hawish might flee to ^ira^f that hit *J.aJcila.ia , niight be accepted tjy the ’Ir&amp;q GovemDienti and that ne tvould then become a source of friction in the same way as the refugee Shammar had been in the past. I pointed out that it was scarcely lln:ely that hawiah v/ould tiy to take refuge in *lraq when the Air Porce were underWKing active operations against him* I asiced him how far he thought Ibn ba’ud was really able to aup^res* the Mutair* He said that according to ills information Ibn ba’ud was holding a meeting of the religious leaders at Riy adh in order to ootain from them a fatwa to the effect that Faisal al bawish had offended against the bhara* by rebelling against the btate f and that he would then be able to declare a *Jenaa* against him* 1 as^eu him wncther he thought that tne Aibhwan tribes would obey such a fatwa* He said that the Earb would undoubtedly do so* As regards the 'Ataibah* Sultan ibn Hum&amp;id was personally not on good 1 terms with Dawish; he had, however, egged him on to his present insubordination and intended to join him if he was thoroughly successful* He would not, however, be really sorry if lawish was crushed fcy Ibn ba f ud and would, in that event, submit to Ibn na’ud* He said that Jawish himself was a religious fanatic and that Ms followers were either religious fanatics Hite himself or scoundrels who were merely out for loot. He said that ibn ba f ud was thorough ly sicic of the yJdiwan who were opposing all his attempts at pro- gress.Ibn ba'ud wished to connect up all Ms headquarters by wire less, which would not only be a more efficient but a much bettor means of communication than the present method, but that he was preventeu from doing so by the Aichwan* I then h&amp;naeu Mm &amp; copy of the notice which it is proposed to drop in Hajd territory; Ms only comment was that it should be printed in good large type* Turning to the question of the i usaiy atj post, he asked me v whether it would not be possible to abandon it* 1 said that not only moDi was tMs entirely out of the question but that otherotiler posts would probawly ua eotablisnea in future# he Uien s&amp;id that no good coulu possibly coae of the continuance of the present discussion of tne wrongs or the rights of the case. \.e would go on insisting that Busaiyah was not 'ala atraf al hudud, while Ibn Sa«ud would go on insisting that it was without enter ing into anj reasonable explanation for his contention, it was quite clear to any intelligent ainn that 'ala atraf al hudud' could only aean within four or five aileo of the frontier, and he oiu not personally uelieve that Ibn Sa^d really thought that there hau been any contravention of the Cjair Protocol. At the same Lime, the tribes were in a state of intense indignation on account ex the establishment of this post and Xbn 3&amp;*ud was com pelled to voice public opinion in the matter. He suggested (and the suggestion seems to me a vexy good one; that recourse should be had Xmx l© arbitration. There could, he imagined, be only one result of such arbitration, but Ibn ba'ud’s fafte would be saved. He would be able* to say to hie tribes, 'f have stated W point of view and the British Government have staged theirt. The case has been referred to an impartial judge and we must abide by his decision.' He thought it would be better for the suggestion for arbitration to come from I bn ba’ud himself and suggested that he snould write to Ibn ba^d proposing this solution without I bn Sa’ud hnowiiAg that he had discussed it with us. He mentioned to me incidentally that he had received a fortnight ago a letter, which he promised to show me, from Ion Ibn La’ud to Lord Lloyd# The letter, after dealing with matters with which Lord ^lo&gt;d was concerned, vvent on to maxe three com plaints connected with ’Iraqi (i) that the High Commissioner hau not answered nis letters, Ui) th£t the Busaiysh post was a con travention ol the Ojair irotoc/ol, and (iii) that he haa certain information that botn iaisal and Abdullah were stirring up ibn Ca’ud’s tribes against him. He said thtr t he had not forwarded this letter and had written to ibn Sa’ud explaining his reasons 1 ' 1 ' ■‘ L4 3oi ooxit&amp;iuea a con^lalxit the * rcaeoaa for ■ithholoin* it. 1 'htee r&lt;se SO u» were, tiiat the letter roesojia were, that the letter Iraq GoTeroment arid again*!

The Shaiich then read out to me portions of tne letter from I bn Sa’ud to Lord Lloyd and of a letter from ibn Sa*ud to the shaikh hi ms e 11 • The letter appeareu to deal mainly with what is now ancient history* the encouragement given some two years ago by King Faisal to some of the kutair who had taken refuge in *Iraq and had subsequently raiaeu into naja. There was mention of the intrigues of “the two brothers' by which expression* the bhnikh saia* King Faisal ana the ^vmir •Abdullah were meant. 1 replied that it was useless to deny that ills Majesty King Faisal was for family and historical reasons not personal 1$ friendly to Ibn Sa f ud. He could not be ext-ected to be sc; some and it was true* 1 said, that two years ago there had been/en- couragement to petty refugees from Eajd on the part of the Palace. But that w%s all long over. The Shammer refugees who came originally from Hail had been for a leng time strictly restrained and the Mutair refugees had been driven north witn such severity that many had since returnee to iiajd. King Faisal* however* muen as he might be personally cold towards Ibn Sa^d* had loyally abided by tne policy of preventing raids in recent years* ana there nan been no foundation latexy for complaints of instigation. 3. The Shaikh replied that this might be so; but the real difficulty lay in the refusal of *lraq to extradite Haja criminals taking refuge in Uraq. It was tx*ue that there were no regular Courts in H&amp;jd* but the justice administered ms ofof thfcr klud euitc.blc to tht dooext tribe© curid tiu?re w&amp;.s no valla ^ ^ there waa excuau iu/oi extraditioii* juoreovtoxytiie question of jpoli- tical oficiider©• in a country lii&amp;e ii&amp;Jd it waa iiapoaaible to aeparatt ^olitioal offences from ordinary criirdnal offences* ^ pointed out tnat tnere nad been no refusal in principle on tut part of T Iraci to conclude an extradition agreement to deal with ordinary criminolu* In Article 10 of the Bahra Agreexaent it this had been specifically provided that discussions with object should be initiated within one year i*e* beiLr^c the 1st Kovexaber, 19&lt;;6* Unfort.unataly first of all Ibn 8a*ud had said that he was too busy to arrange a conference with ’Iraq and later when a conference waa arranged circumstances had prevented its taxing place* i thougnt that now 9 as soon as the difficulties caused by the Mutair raids hrd passedt the negotiations for an extradition agreement should certainly take place* hut I warned him that there could be no yielding on the point of political offenders* To refuse the extradition of political offenders was a universal custom, both in hurope among the most advanced nations ana in Asia among the most backward, and Ibn b&amp;^d could not expect an exception to ce made for mm* raids* The Shaixch repeated what he nad said to the Counsellor* I assured him that the last thought of His iritannic Majesty’s Government, or of myself as their representative, or even of the •Iraq Government (who were not influenced by the persofr^l of hing Faisal) was to weaken Ibn Sa’ud* We recognised that without him Arabia would fall into anarchy and that it was far better for ‘Iraq that Ahere should be a strong consolidated Government on her borders* hut we could not sit still ana do nothing under the constant attacks from the iiutair and, as Ibn ba'ud had told ua that they were out of his control, nothing was left for ua but to try to restrain them ourselves by punitive measures* If they were weakened oy our measures, it would be so much the easier for Ibn ba’ua to regain control of them* 1 5.

The bhaikh then turned to the question oi id^ iaistiion to iSgypt and Ibn baud* a letter to Lord Lloyd. He said that the principal question about which ibn Sa , ud was concerned was the Italian penetration of thejyem«n« This made Ibn position Insecure and was bound to bring trouble in its train. It was far the most vxtfcl question from Ibn point of view, he was commissioned to &amp;Eiy to ford Lloyd that, if Hlo hritannic Majesty* b Government could arrange to excluae Italian iih'luence from the Yemen, Ibn Sa*ud could then unu.rtaxe the exclusion of Bolshevik influence from the Hi jaz which uu* a matter ol the greatest importance for the British. The Lolsnevixs, largely* through the pilgrims from the Latch Last Indies, were in a position to do grsat harm in the Hijaz ana to spread their propaganda among 411 the pilgrims. There were also strong contingents of pilgrims from Central Asia, where of cour&amp;t* Bolshevix influence was supreme. Ibn 8 a*ud, tne Shaikh aid, was very sinxious that a British repretentatir* »iu&gt;ula go t fc4 So^ &lt;$&gt; to confyr with hiru on these two points ana also on the relations between himself caia •Irat* and they hoped that the representative would be someone liice Sir Gilbert Clayton* I made no comment on the points about Italian penetration of the Yemen and about bolshevik propaganda, except to as! him whether Ibn Sa^d be lt eveo. that bolshevik propaganaa could be aan^erous to his own rule* The Shaik replies, that it wad undoubtedly dangerous to Ibn Sa'ud, since it aimed generally at upsetting men’s minds and destroying all authority* 9* The Shaikh then took his leave* I again urged on him to impress on Ibn Sa ? ud that I personally as High Commissioner enter*- tained the friendliest feelings towards his rule and was anxious to see iv strengthened and that I had in the past insisted and should continue to insist that nothing should be done from the ’Iraci side in a spirit unfriendly to him or designed to weaken his control* (Sd) H* bobbs. a/i/28V Telegran From To Unnumbered.

Secretary of State for the Colonies, High Commissioner, Baghdad. received 22nd January 1928. London. H.M’s. Government greatly appreciate His Majesty’s confidence in them and are most anxious to ass- -ict in every way in their power to find a solution of present difficulties between Nejd and Iraq. For this purpose they hope that His Majesty will find it possible at an early date t 0 accept the invitation which they sent him on January 2nd to meet Col. HAWORTH, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, for a discussion of the regrettable mia- -underslanding which has arisen in regard to the Treaty. They are unable to understand on what grounds His Majesty and Nejd tribes could regard construction of Busaiyah post as an infraction of the UQ,AIR protocol; the latter speaks of 'ALA ATRAF AL HUDUD' (near frontier; whereas BUSAIYAH is no less than 50 miles from the neutral zone. It is of this first importance that IhK misunderstanding should toe clearec up. H.M’s. Government are confident that this object will be fully attained at a meeting of His Majesty and Col. HAWORTH but should any further discussion appear necessary at a later stage they will be quite prepared to consider other arrangements for a meeting between representatives of themselves and Your Majesty. Meanwhile they hope that His Majesty will realise their own difficulties. They have a very definite responsibility in respect of IRAQ and for this purpose the HIGH COMMISSIONER,' BAGHDAD, is thsar representative. This responsibility applies more particularly to maintaining order and defence. Innocent IRAQIS have been murdered and robbed by NEJD tribes. Just as His Majesty must acceptaccept responsibility for actionf of Hejdis so HX3DGCX H.M’s. Goyerniient must observe their responsitilities for defence of Iraqis. it is in these circumstances that they have, as His Majesty has already been notified, been compelled to authorise their Air Force in Iraq to punish raiders and if necessary pursue them across border. His Majesty will realise that these punitive measures are justified and inevitable such were they in the nature of police measures against criminals and are in no way military measures against Nejd.

Wa wrote vary frankly to tha British Govarnmant our opinion about tha prac^nt incidents which ^ava takon place between ug and the Iraq Gov~rn-ant. Matters are becoming more critical every day and we find no way for Gottllng such trouble except to make matters clear about evarv new critical situation so that they (H.Jl’g Govt.) may Gee their way to help ug in a manner that may decrease the troubles whicli are on the increase every day. We have fully stated in our previous replies the effects in Hajd of the actions of the Iraq Government that all the raids were due to it and that the present ( troubles which we and the British Government are experiencing now are due to those actions. We then received the warning of the British Government which is | in coppliance to the desire of the Irae Government that they (British Government ) intend to raid our land with their aeroplanes and give our tribesmen a blow within our territory, tfe explained that it was a transgression against our independence and disgraceful to our national authority, w : ^ile the correspondence was not over yet and there was no necessity for this action. We realised thebad results whci ari e9 fron euoh aotB . How th , n9we “bout thiB attack: -me spread anon* ourytribesnsn and f- Hav, cone to know that the Iran Govornnent intend to ser an expedition (force) to raid ourlandc. after w^ble tc nako natters caln at the frontier, as a result of the urudont steps we had taken and of the soothing proclanati at the xrentier and the neighbouring land; after taking such actions and after being able to restrict the trouble and caln the mind of the excited people. After all these troubles which we took to attain such results, the proclamations of the Iraq Government cane out with the nev of their expedition, and t e news of the warning of the British Government. This has pulldown a great portion of the troubles we took to stop the excitement, the eigne of which we belelve the British Government must have seen in these last days, thould the Iraq Government do what they hav- published or if the thing of which the British G Government gave warning takes place we can hardly estimate the amount of excitement which may arise from such actiont and beleive t. at t; e wise and mild mail in Najd will be even more stirred than the Ignorant and iwpassionate man. This as can he seen by our friend the (British) government will add to the difflcuilty and trouble which we take in t interest ak both^our people and our Arab nation and of our friend the British Government. The signs of this began ‘ o appear after the spread of these recent news in the country• Wq caw another thing th* rneult of which should not be ignored and steps should be taken so that neither we the neightbouring Governments, nor the British Government nay have trouble resulting from it. It is this.Hie nature of the soil and thenecessity imposed on its inhabitants to wander to the rich ga^rzing lands caused tfem to mix with each other viz the Iraq tribesmen with liajd tribesmen and the tribesmen of Trans Jordan! a with the Uajd tribesmen. T.h.is (mixing) cause if 1 I B 1a liking (to »ach otlisr) among ths triboanen of both countries. We opposed its effect with all our night being convinced of the troubles that will result to neighbouring Governments and this we did for the s'ke of preserving our Undertakings towards then. But we saw that sone of the Iraq and Transjordania trlbesnen showed signs of being weary of their Gov'rnnont, which will displease both the uovernnents.

With reference to my telegram Wo. 55 dated the 27th January 1928 and subsequent correspondence on the subject of the recent fighting on the borders of Kuwait, the following is an account of what actually happened. reached Kuwait that VUi bin ’Aohwan, of the Aulad .Vaeil sub-section of the Buraih section of the liutair, with a force of 350 camel riders and 50 horsemen, had raided the Kuwait MJraibdur, or local Arabs, at Umnj Huwaisat, in the J hiqaq district, 38 miles to the north-west of Jahrah, icill- -ing three men and carrying off a considerable number of came Is and sheep. All avciilable cars were at once commandeered and sent out to Jahrah the same night, with orders to proceed to JUda’i, 90 miles further to the west-south-west, as soon as it was light enough to see, in the hope of cutting off the raiders’ retreat the 28th January fifteen cars out of the twenty five which had left Kuwait atrived at ^iqa’i - a very creditable per- -formance in view of the fact that there is no road beyond Jahrah, and all the cars were grossly overloaded, some carr\- Cn the evening of Friday, the 27th January, news 'his they succeeded in doing, and at 4.30 p.m. on t -ing as many as nine men. There they encountered the raiders, and at once attacked them. Although only numbering2 numbering about 75 rifles, the Kuwait force was very much b&lt;? arine ' ^ ,in raiti «rs # to whom moreover the motor car was an entirely new factor in war. The result was that the Kuwait force inflicted very heavy casualties on the enemy, ana rorcea them to abandon a very considerable portion of the booty. 'heir own casualties were cora- -paratively light, but included Shaikh »Ali al-Khalifah $th« hoimnander-in-Chief of trie Kuwait forcesj who was severely wounded, and Shaikh ’Abdullah al-Jabir ( the orother of the Shaikh of Kuwait; who was ilightly wounded. After the engagement jbxxxsxkx proper was over • haikh VAli as-: alira (a son of the late Shaikh of Kuwait) a very S^Hant but hot-headed and rash young man, who had been aelayed by car trouble, arrived on the scene, much gali -eci at being too late for the engagement. in direct ae A lance oi orders he insisted on pressing on alone, with -ne result that he and his party were trapped in the Batin, where they iought till they ran out of ammunition, ana were eventually butchered in cold blood. h U i for this regretable incident the action of the Kuwait force would have been an unqualified success. As it was the Kuwait casualties on the 28th January amounted to eleven killed and kbout the same number wounded, oi whom one has since died. ' ;, he casualties amongst the uutair are not accurately Known, but twenty seven killed is the most modest estimate, and something between thiity-iive and forty is probably nearer the cor- -rect ligure* In addition to this many were doubtless wounaed and a considerable number of animals were killed. ^our Kuwait cars had to be temporarily abandoned but these have since been brought in. On the 29th January British aeroplanes located the raiders in Nejd territory fifteen miles north of i'afar al- -Batin. he raiders opened fire on the aircraft, which replied3 a i 3 replied with bombs and machine gun fire, inflicting eaaual- -il a estimated at ten men and twenty camels killed. (/n the afternoon oi the 30th January our aero- -planes twice attacked the raiders eight miles south of iiatar al Batin, and are believed to have killed twelve men and a number of camels and horses. /n the w hole the raiders appear to hove suffered very heavily, anti will probably not look upon Kuwait tribes as such an easy prey in future as they have done inxx in the past. ’he extensive use of cars by the Kuwait forces in this engagement is interesting, and it gives them an advantage over the ikhwan which the latter can never counter. fd/- J. c.

Action ouggested would definitely link Kuwait with ’Iraq in Ibn Gaud’s mind and points are, firat, whether (a) with preaent Iraq strained relations thia ia desirable in Kuwait interests or (bj at any tirne in furtherance of our luture policy, second, whether Air and Iraq present necess- -iticc are sufficient to outweigh other political conoider- -ations.' -Kuwait’s coimnercial prosperity depends upon Nejd and the town is stagnant owing to Ibn Gaud’s embargo on transit trade with Hejd: this is one of the subjects 1 hope to get settled with Ibn Gaud when 1 meet him. ibn Gaud is already sore over Kuwait but with added irritation of aero- -planes stationed in Kuwait taking action on behalf of Iraq against distant objectives in Nejd this soreness will necessarily become enmity without corresponding benefit to Kuwait. 'he advantage of Ibn Gaud learning that uwait has adequate support is, I thime, outweighed by the position which would arise, and which I think would only be permissib if our relations with Ibn Gaud were definitely ruptured. In jtix writing to Ibn Gaud I stated that 1 felt sure that a meeting wax with hire would put tin end to present unfortunate conditions: in replying he has taken up this point and cays that he is in full agreement with this and that unquestionably a meeting will have the effect of ending present difficulties. With the bad case which he has at present I would in his position myself play for time before having the meeting.Uri 11 i jien meeting takes iuace or tlefinitei is not to take place 1 would t.-ike no action to make our relations more difficult except auch ua its obviously necessary for protection of Kuwait and Iraq frontiers. Puide though regrettable have occurred from all time and thus with regard to second point i would urge that however irritating they are they should for the moment be met by temporary or tactical methods and should not be regarded as sufficiently important to affect out permanent policy. The gradual tightening up of Iraq defence methods and the line of forte wil1 ultimately assure the permanent safety of the frontier. Kuwait is under Hia Government’s protection and I think it is important that this point should remain clear and that nothing which might link .Kuwait with Iraq in minds either of Ibn Paud, Shaikh of Kuwait or Iraq should be contemplated if avoidable even though to us it only appears that our Air force is taking action.^elcgram From Political ^esicient.

Reports have, however, reached me which indicate that certain raids were carried out in this region some four months ago by tribes, including the Shammar, resident in Syria and it is no doubt to these raids that Your Majesty refers. The reports which have reached me are indefinite and incomplete and 1 am causing full enquiries to be made, the result of which I will not fail to communicate to Your Majesty. In the meantime it would greatly assist the progress of these enquiries if Your Majesty could communi cate to me any further particulars concerning the raids to which Your Majesty refers. 5 . 1 am grateful for the arrangements which Your Majesty has made for the return of the camels of the Suqur.
