India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, ^i r &gt; \ 1 st December 1897. I am directed by tbe Secretary of State for India to request that you will invite the attention of the Marquis of Salisbury to the necessity for adopting some measures to check or control the trade which is being carried on in arms and ammunition with Muscat. 2. It appears that a very considerable export of rifles and cartridges and other ammunition to the Persian Gulf has taken place in the last few years, and during the present year it has assumed proportions which cannot fail to give rise to anxiety in connection with military operations on the Indian frontier, and with the state of British relations with Afghanistan. There is reason to believe that, although the exporters nominally ship their cases of rifles, which in the bills of lading are described as “ hardware,” to Bushire, Bahrein, Bunder Abbas, and other places in the Persian Gulf, yet their actual destination is IVIuscat, which has become a great dep 6 t for arms and ammunition. Nbt only do the firms engaged in the trade employ European agents to push it, but also several natives of India take part in it, and the consignments are packed in such form as to be easilv transported on the backs of camels into the interior. I he customs of Muscat are farmed, at times to natives of India, and the sole interest of the farmer is to stimulate trade. The authority of the Sultan is weak, and it is believed that the arms, after being landed in Muscat or transferred to dhows off the coast, are smuggled across the Gulf to the ^opposite side for export to India and Afghanistan, although the importation of arms into Persia and India is prohibited. v , 3. A considerable measure of control over the traffic would be secured if it were possible either to prohibit the import of arms into Oman, or to stop their export from the United Kingdom ; but there are practical difficulties in the adoption of either of these plana. 4. The Sultan is fully alive to the danger to his own rule arising from the trade, but it is not altogether clear whether Article 7 of the Treaty of Commerce with Great Britain, dated the 19th of March 1891, might not be construed as limiting his authority in regard to the import of arms. Some question might also .be raised upon the scope of the Treaty of the 21st of September 1833 with the United States, and of other engagements contracted with Foreign Powers. A certain check might be secured by the imposition * On this point, see No. 3, page 7. of a heavy import duty, which at present forms the subject of corre spondence* with the Foreign Office, ending with your letter dated 3rd November. But even if this plan could be carried out, it would involve a delay which it is most desirable to avoid. 5. The second plan just mentioned, namely, that of preventing the export of arms and ammunition from this country by the issue of an Order in Council, under Section 138 of Statute 39 and 40 Viet. c. 36, is also attended by difficulties. It would involve an unusual interference with British trade, and after a time it might prove ineffectual by merely transferrin' S. 8. A Political No. 2385/97.the traffic from Manchester or London to Antwerp or some other foreign port. 6 . On the supposition, therefore, that difficulties of the kind indicated may be found to exist, it becomes necessary to. consider how far any check upon the export of arms from Muscat to India and Afghanistan can be applied by action to be taken at Muscat and on the coasts of Persia and Gwadar. If the Sultan of Muscat would publish a proclamation forbidding the export or transhipment of arms and ammunition from his dominions to Persia, or Baluchistan, or India, persons engaged in the prohibited trade might be jmnished under the law of Muscat or under the Orders in Council. In this connection it may be observed that in 1892 the Sultan issued a proclamation prohibiting the re-exportation to Africa of guns imported into Muscat, and in March 1891 His Highness prohibited their import into Gwadar and its dependencies. In view of these precedents, I am to inquire whether, in the opinion of the Marquis of Salisbury, the presentation to the Sultan of a request from His Majesty the Shah of Persia and of a similar request from the Government of India asking the Sultan to prohibit the export or transhipment of arms and ammunition to, the coasts of Persia and of India and its protected States would not justify the ruler of Oman in issuing such an order. If any British subject should then disobey the Order, he might be dealt with under Article 13 of the Treaty and Article 19 of the Order in Council of the 4th November 1867. 7. If this measure could be adopted, it would be possible to take certain steps in England which would materially assist the Sultan in carrying out his prohibition. At present the exporters of arms merely specify that they are “ consigned to order,” and print no addresses upon their cases. Their bills of lading are also misleading. The British Customs authorities might be willing, under the provisions of the Explosives Act, 1875, and the Customs laws, to require all exporters of arms and ammunition for the Persian Gulf to specify in detail the nature of their exports and the name of the consignee, and to produce copies of their bills of lading drawn up in accordance with such specification. A regular examination of some of the cases before shipment would secure accuracy in these returns, and enable Government to learn something about the course of trade. It would be convenient if the Customs officers could be directed to send a copy of the specifications to the India Office for communication to the Political autho rities in the Gulf. Measures could then be taken in advance of the arrival of the ships in Persian or Oman waters to see whether the cases reached the ports for which they are nominally shipped, and a watch could be kept on their final destination. 8 . It is alleged that a dep 6 t for arms is maintained at Bahrein by one firm of British shippers, Messrs. Fracis, Times &amp; Co., of which two natives of India are partners. Lord George Hamilton is not aware of any objections to an agreement being arrived at'with the Chief of Bahrein prohibiting the landing of any explosives or rifles on that coast. I am to inquire whether the Marquis of Salisbury concurs in this view. 9 . I am to add that the ships which are ready to carry cases of arms and ammunition are comparatively few, and it is believed that shippers from foreign European ports find difficulty in securing freights except by British ships. As the Secretary of State for' Foreign. Affairs is aware, it is not merely the danger of importation into India through the Native States which has to be considered, but also the course of trade with Afghanistan. The Amir has hitherto relied mainly on importation through India, where, if necessity arises, some check can be kept on his supplies. But if he can get all he requires through Persia without the knowledge of the Government of India, a fresh difficulty will be introduced into our dealings with Afghan istan. It is quite certain that the trade with Muscat has grown enormously in the past few months, and that it shows no signs of diminution. It is well known that the arms are not required for the territories of the Sultan,and in view of the urgent need for putting some limitation upon it, I am to request that you will take an early opportunity of submitting these various proposals for the consideration of the Secretary of State for .Foreign Affairs. I have, &amp;c.. The Under Secretary of State, Horace Walpole. Foreign Office. No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, Sir, 13th December 1897. I have laid before the Marquess of Salisbury your letter of the 1st Political instant, inviting His Lordship’s attention to the necessity for adopting some No * 241 6/97. measures to cheek or control the trade in arms and ammunition which is now carried on with Muscat and other parts of the Persian Gulf, from whence it would appear that they find their -way into Afghanistan and possibly to the tribes on the North-Western frontier of India. Lord Salisbury concurs with Lord George Hamilton in thinking it very desirable that some steps should be taken with this object, and I am to offer the following observations on the various measures suggested in your letter. Firstly, as regards the possible prohibition of the export of arms from the United Kingdom to Muscat, the difficulties of which are fully recognised by Lord George Hamilton, I am to enclose a memorandum on the subject by the Librarian of this Department, from which it will be seen that in the present state of the law it is not practicable to forbid by Order in Council the export of arms and ammunition from the United Kingdom to certain specified places, but that the prohibition if issued must be general. Secondly, as regards the alternative course of obtaining from the Sultan of Muscat a prohibition of either the export or import of arms from or into his dominions. On this point I am to invite Lord George Hamilton’s attention to a further memorandum by the Librarian of this Department, of which a copy is enclosed, showing the Treaty engagements of Muscat with foreign Powers. It will be seen that under the treaties with France, Holland, and the United States, as well as under the Treaty of Commerce with this country, the Sultan is precluded from prohibiting the import or export of any articles of commerce, and that, although on one occasion, in 1892, he prohibited the re-exportation to Africa of guns imported from that continent, it is doubtful whether this measure could be justified if objections had been raised to it as contrary to Treaty obligations. In view of the recent failure of the negotiations with France for an increase of the duty on the import of arms into Muscat, of which you were informed in the letter from this Office of the 3rd ultimo, it seems clear that the French Government would not agree to an actual prohibition by the Sultan of the import or export of arms into or from his dominions. These objections would not, however, in Lord Salisbury’s opinion, apply to a proposal that the Sultan of Muscat should be requested by Her Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government to issue—not a prohibition—but a warning to residents in Muscat, both native and foreign, against the export of arms and munitions of war to Persia and British India where such traffic is forbidden ; and a telegram of which a copy is enclosed lias been sent to Her Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires at Teheran, inviting the concurrence of the Persian Government in this cause. Should this proposal be agreed to, it might be arranged that the warning should be strongly worded in such a manner as to enable the authorities in this country to take the steps suggested in your letter. With regard to Bahrein, I am to enclose a memorandum from which it will be seen that the Chief is not bound by any Treaty engagements which4 would stand in the way of an agreement being arrived at with him of the nature proposed by the Government of India. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State T. TL Sanderson. for India. Enclosure 1 in No. 2 . The Marquess of Salisbury to Mr. C. Hardinge. No. 31 (Telegraphic). Eoreign Office, 8 th December 1897, 6.25 p.m. Her Majesty’s Government have information that large quantities of arms and ammunition are being exported from this country to the southern ports of Persia, and to Muscat and Bahrein, from which places they are smuggled across into Persia. They have reason to believe that a considerable portion of these consign ments find their way into Afghanistan, and, possibly, eventually reach the tribes on the north-west frontier of India. The importation of arms into Persia being prohibited, this traffic is illegal, and as contrary to Persian as it is to British interests. Represent this to Persian Government, and inquire whether they will notify that importers of arms and ammunition from the United Kingdom into Persia must obtain permits from the Persian Representative or Consular officers, and will allow our vessels to seize and hand over to the Persian authorities for confiscation any cargoes of arms owned by British or Persian subjects which may be found in Persian waters destined for illicit importa tion ; and whether they will join us in requesting the Sultan of Muscat to issue a notice warning his subjects and others resident in Muscat from exporting arms to Persia or British India, as importation of such merchandize into those countries is prohibited, and to permit action by British ships of war in the waters of Muscat for preventing such traffic by subjects of Great Britain, Persia, and Muscat. Enclosure 2 in No. 2 . A.— Memorandum. Poreign Office. 27th November 1897. In 1873 tbe question of prohibiting the export of arms from this country to Assinee was referred to the Law Officers by the Colonial Office, and they were asked whether, under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1853, such export could be prohibited by Proclamation on Order in Council. They reported that, in their Opinion, the power of the Crown to prohibit the export of arms, ammunition, gunpowder and other articles under 16 and 17 VTct. c. 106, sec. 150, was limited to those cases in which the exportation was altogether forbidden. (C. O. 23rd May 1873). In another report they stated (15th May 1873) that Her Majesty’s Government could take no steps to stop the importation by British subjects or in British vessels of arms and ammunition into Assinee or into any other neighbouring port outside the limits of Her Majesty’s Settlements on the Gold Coast other than to obtain the joint offices of friendly Powers to prevent the importation and sale of arms and ammunition out of their territory, and to prevent by all means within the power of the Local Governments the sale of arms, &amp;c., to the Ashantees. The Cabinet therefore decided to introduce a Bill to give power to prohibit export of arms to any particular place or places, and a draft Bill was submitted to the Law Officers; but they reported on the 28th May 18735 that in their opinion the draft Bill should not be submitted to Parliament, because, if it became law, Her Majesty might, in the event of a war in which Great Britain was neutral, be required by either belligerent to issue the proposed Proclamation or Order in Council. If the request were complied with, the result would be a restriction upon the commerce of the country, entirely new in international law, and most difficult to carry out. If, on the other hand, the request were not complied with, Her Majesty and the Government of the day would be exposed to charges of partiality and breach of neutrality. They were unable, they added, to propose any modification of the proposal. The Bill was therefore abandoned. The Customs Consolidation Act now in force is almost word for word the same, as respects the prohibition to export arms, &amp;c., as the one in force when the Law Officers reported in 1873. Section 138 commences thus :— “ The following goods may, by Proclamation or Order in Council, be prohibited either to be exported or carried coastwise, arms, ammunition and gunpowder,” &amp;c., &amp;c. (39 &amp; 40 Viet. c. 36, sec. 138.) Pormerly Orders in Council were issued under 29 Geo. II. c. 16, and 33 Geo. III. c. 2. The former Act declared that “ His Majesty may prohibit “ the exporting or attempting to export saltpetre out of their kingdom in “ such manner and under such restraints as he shall think fit.” This prohibition extended to all arms and ammunition. Act 6 Geo. IV., c. 107, says that certain enumerated goods (arms, &amp;c.) shall be either absolutely prohibited to be exported only under the restrictions mentioned in an annexed table. All these old Acts have, however, been repealed. The Colonial Office, on the occasion here referred to, consulted the Commissioners of Customs on the question, and the latter in the course of their report said : “If it be deemed necessary to take any measures with a “ view to prevent the exportation of arms, &amp;c., from this country to the w'est “ coast of Africa, there does not appear to be any practical objection, as far “ as the Customs Department is concerned, to the issue of a Proclamation “ under the 150th section of the Customs Consolidation Act 1853, totally “ prohibiting the exportation or carrying coastwise of arms, ammunition, “ &amp;c., such Order to be subsequently modified, either by the Lords of the “ Treasury or by an Order in Council, giving authority to the Customs to “ allow the removal coastwise, or the exportation of such goods to places “ other than the west coast of Africa, on satisfactory proof that the goods “ are not intended for, nor likely to be sold to, the Ashantees; bonds being “ given in each case that the goods shall be actually landed at the place of “ destination for which they shall have been entered * (27th May 1873). The Commissioners pointed out that this course had been adopted during the Crimean war in various instances, which they quoted. The course suggested was not, however, followed on this occasion, and it does not appear that the Law Officers were consulted about it, though they were informed that such a suggestion had been made, but not acted upon (22nd August 1873). * Foreign Office Print of 22nd July 1373. A collection* of certain ancient Acts, {See 2385 Political of 1897.') &amp;c., is sent herewith. (Signed) A. H. Oakes. Enclosure 3 in No. 2. B.—Memorandum. The 7th Article of the Treaty of Commerce between Great Britain and Muscat, of 19th March 1891, declares that—“ No article whatever shall be “ prohibited from being imported into, or exported from, the territories “ of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, and no export duties are to he “ levied on goods exported from those territories except with the consent “ of the Government of Her Britannic Majesty, such consent being subject “ to the conditions that may be laid down in the Notifications intimating the “ same.” S. 8. BThe Treaty between the United States and Muscat, of 21 st September 1S33, says :—“ Article II. The citizens of the United States shall have free “ liberty to enter all the ports of His Majesty Seyed Syeed Bin, Sultan, with “ their cargoes, of whatever kind their said cargoes may consist, and they “ shall have liberty to sell the same to any of the subjects of the Sultan or “ others,” &amp;c. “ It is understood and agreed, however, that the articles of muskets, “ powder, and ball can only be sold to the Government in the Island of “ Zanzibar; but, in all the other ports of the Sultan, the said munitions of “ war may be freely sold, without any restrictions whatever, to the highest “ bidder.” Article III. stipulates for a maximum of 5 per cent, import duty to cover all charges whatever, “ Nor shall any charge be paid on that part of the cargo which may remain on board unsold and re-exported.” Article lY. gives most favoured nation treatment in respect of duties. The Treaty between France and Muscat, of 17th November 1841, declares (Article II.) that the respective subjects “pourront en toute liberty, entrer, r^sider, commercer et circuler . . . avec leurs marchandises,” and that they shall reciprocally have the right to all the privileges and advantages which are or may be accorded to the subjects of the most favoured nation. Article X. provides for most favoured nation treatment in the matter of duties with the 5 per cent, maximum, and adds, “ II ne sera exige aucun droit sur la partie de la cargaison qui ne sera point debarquee,” &amp;c. French vessels are also admitted to most favoured nation treatment. Article XI. says: “ Aucun article quelconque de commerce ne sera “ prohibe, soit a 1 ’importation, soit a Fexportation. dans les Etats de S. A. “ le Sultan de Mascate, le commerce y sera parfaitement libre et ne sera “ soumis qu’un seul droit d’importation autorisd par I’article precedent et k “ aucun autre.” The commercial declaration between the Netherlands and Muscat of the 7th April (27th August) 1877 confers most favoured nation treatment of the Hutch flag and subjects, which is also extended to merchandize in thematter of imports, exports, and transit. It would appear, from the above-quoted extracts from the treaties, that Muscat has bound herself, either expressly or through the operation of the most favoured nation clause, to permit the importation, as well as the export, of every article whatsoever. It is*true that in 1892 the Sultan issued a proclamation prohibiting the re-exportation to Africa of guns imported from Africa. This was done at the request of the British Resident, on representations received from Her Majesty’s Agent at Zanzibar. Whether the Sultan thereby infringed his treaties may perhaps be questioned under the peculiar circumstances, and in view of Article VIII. of the Brussels Act. Foreign Office, (Signed) A. H. Oakes. 26th November 1897. Enclosure 4 in No. 2. C.— Memorandum. Treaty Engagements of Bahrein. The only engagement respecting freedom of trade, by which the Buler of Bahrein is bound, would appear to be that contained in Article 4 of the Convention with this country of the 31st May 1861, which is as follows:— “ British subjects of every denomination, it is understood, may reside in and carry on their lawful trade in the territories of Bahrein, their goods being subject only to an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent, in cash or in kind. This amount once paid shall not be demanded again on the same goods if exported from Bahrein to other places ; and, in respect to the treatment ofBritish subjects and dependants, they shall receive the treatment and consideration of the subjects and dependants of the most favoured people.” There appears to be no record of any treaties between Bahrein and other countries than Great Britain. On the 22 nd December 1880 an agreement was signed between the Chief of Bahrein and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, which is stated to hare been ratified by Her Majesty’s Government in 1881. In it the Chief bound himself and his successors to abstain from entering into negotiations or making treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the said British Government, and to refuse permission to any other Government than the British Government to establish diplomatic or consular agencies, or coaling depots in his territory unless with the consent of the British Government (“ Aitchison’s Treaties,” Yol. 10 (1892), page 120 ). This engagement did not apply or affect the customary friendly corre spondence with the local authorities of neighbouring States on business of minor importance. On the 13th March 1892 a treaty was signed between the Chief of Bahrein and the Political Resident, which contained the following engagement on the part of the Chief :— “Isi. That I will on no account enter into any agreement or correspon dence with any Power other than the British Government. “ 2 nd. That, without the assent of the British Government, I will not consent to the residence within my territory of the Agent of any other Government. “ 3rd. That I will on no account cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory save to the British Government.” This Treaty was ratified by the Governor General of India on the 12 th May 1892. (“ Hertslet’s Treaties,” Yol. 19, p. 773.) It would seem, from the wording in the Convention of 1861, lawful trade,” as well as from the peculiar relations between this country and Bahrein, that if the Chief, on the advice of the British Government, made the export of arms from his territories illegal, the terms of the Article of the Convention would not thereby be contravened. Foreign Office, (Signed) A. H. Oakes. 3rd December 1897. No. 3. From Secretary of State to Yiceroy, 17th December 1897. (Telegraphic.) Your letter, No. 116, of 4th August. Enhancement of import duty at Muscat seems impracticable, since France objects to modify treaty of 1844. Treaty obligations seem also to preclude notification by Sultan generally restricting either importation or export of arms and ammu nition. Only practicable course appears to be issue by Sultan at request of India and Persia of strong warning to residents in Muscat that importations of arms and ammunition into Persia or India are prohibited. Persia is being asked to make representation to Muscat, and to agree to action by British ships of war in Persian waters for preventing such traffic by subjects of Great Britain, Persia and Muscat. Muscat can then be asked by your Government to agree to similar action in Muscat waters, and I will telegraph terms of proposed request. If these agreements are arrived at, and suitable measures taken to enforce seizure of illicit exports, the trade might be stopped by heavy losses. I could arrange to send to Muscat if you wish intimation of ships carrying arms. The “ Baluchistan ” left Manchester 10 th December with large consignment, and other ships are following. It is therefore desirable to make all pre liminary arrangements for conveying the request to Muscat and ensuring co-operation of ships of war before the cargo of the ship “ Baluchistan ”is distributed from Muscat. I am also informed that Fracis Times have a depot on Bahrein, and I suggest that early treaty be made with Sheikh to prohibit all imports or exports of arms from that island. Lord Salisbury has just approved confiscation at Bushire of 2,000 rifles imported by Fracis Times. No. 4. Enclosure in Foreign Office Letter of 17th December 1897. Mr. C.

Following is text of request annroved No. 2436/9, . * 3 by Lord Salisbury, which may be pre sented to the Sultan of Muscat by earliest opportunity :—“ The British Government and the Government of His Majesty the Shah of Persia are informed that arms and ammunition are being imported into Persia and Baluchistan from the territories of Muscat and its dependencies, and it is believed that they are by this means surreptitiously distributed among the tribes subject to Persia, and also carried to tribes on the frontiers of India who are engaged in hostilities with themOESSE 9 Britisli Government. Any such traffic in arms, ammunition and other munitions of war is contrary to the existing law of the Persian and British Indian Governments; and accordingly the two Governments unite in requesting His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to w'arn his subjects and all persons resident in his territories to refrain from exporting the articles mentioned from His Highness’s dominions to Persian, Baluch, or British Indian ports, where their importation is illegal. Her Majesty’s Government is prepared to co-operate with His Highness the Suitan of Muscat in enforcing these orders, as well as those issued by the Sultan in 1891, prohibiting export to Gwadar and its adjacent territory. His Highness’s authority is therefore invited, in order that British and Persian ships of war may be authorised to stop this illicit traffic, and to seize and confiscate any cargoes of arms owned by British, Persian, or Muscat subjects, which may be found in Muscat or in Persian waters, destined for illicit importation into the ports of Persia, India, or Gwadar.” Persia has been informed, and has agreed already to action by British ships in Persian waters for stopping illicit traffic. Action will accordingly be taken at once, and Admiralty has been requested to issue necessary orders to ships in Gulf. Purther instructions will follow as to adjudication of questions arising, and as to distribution of proceeds of confiscation. The early assent of Sultan is desirable, to enable action to be taken in respect of ship “ Baluchistan ” on way to Muscat. Telegraph in due course arrangements made with Bahrein. I No. 7.

Illicit shipments by “ Baluchistan,” now at sea, may also be seized, but only in Persian waters, unless agreement with Muscat is executed before her arrival. Inform Gulf authorities, and add that Customs returns of exports from this country by both ships will be sent by next mail to Bushire and Muscat in case of dispute. No. 8. . India Office to Customs. India Office, Sir, 21 st December 1897. I am directed by Lord George Hamilton to request that the several Political Customs ofilcers concerned may be instructed to co-operate in certain pro- No ' 2416 / 97 * ceedings which are being taken by Her Majesty’s Government to check an illicit traffic in arms and ammunition with the Persian Coast and the borders of India through Maskat and the ports in the Persian Gulf. 2 . In order that the measures which have been authorised for adoption in Oman and Persian waters may be successful, it is important that the India Office should receive full and accurate returns of all shipments of arms, ammunition, and munitions of war made from ports in the United Kingdom to Maskat or the Persian Gulf. I am to inquire whether the regulations could not be altered so as to require exporters to send in their returns at the same time as their cases are shipped. It is desirable that the description and number of guns and cartridges and other munitions should be returned together with the name of the consignees. If it should be possible to enforce the presentation of the bills of lading, in order to verify the specifications given by exporters, that course would be convenient, as it S. 8. Cr 10 Political No. 2440/97. is -understood that these hills represent the contents of cases of guns and cartridges as “ hardware ” and “ merchandise.” 3. The punctual despatch to this Office of the returns mentioned will enable the Secretary of State for India to keep the local authorities in the Gulf acquainted with the shipments of arms before the ships arrive. By this means supervision over their ultimate destination will be facilitated. But it is also desirable to discourage this particular traffic by enforcing such scrutiny and inspection of some of the cases and other means of verification as the law and regulations may permit. In this connection, I am to state that Lord George Hamilton is informed, with reference to a statement of arms of British and Irish manufacture which was lately submitted to him, that some of the cartridges and rifles so returned were made in Belgium and sent from Antwerp to Manchester, where they were put on board a ship sailing for the Persian Gulf. It is therefore suggested for your con sideration whether instructions might not he given to the Customs officers at Manchester/ and other ports whence these arms are sent, to examine more frequently the contents of the cases, and to enforce legal penalties for false returns. 4. I am to add that the ships which are understood to be chiefly engaged in the trade are those owned by the Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company and the Anglo-Arabian Persian Company, and in particular the steamships “ Turkestan,” “ Arabistan,” “ Biluchistan,” “ Tresco,” and “Alphonse ” have been employed in the traffic. It is believed that the “ Tripoli ” will be despatched by Messrs. Bucknall Brothers from Manchester on the 1st of January next with a cargo of arms and ammunition for the Gulf, and I am to request that, if possible, the measures suggested in this letter may be applied to it. Should the Secretary of State for India be made aware of the intention to send similar cargoes by any other ships, an intimation of the fact will be made to you, in order to facilitate the execution of the instructions which may be issued by the Customs House on the subject.

I am to observe that if arms are seized in Muscat waters without having entered the territorial waters of Persia, it seems open to doubt whether the Persian Government has a right to them, in preference to the right of the Sultan of Oman in whose waters, and by whose authority, they were intercepted. But it appears to Lord George Hamilton that the question is one which can be reserved until it is seen whether the shippers or consignees claim possession of the arms and ammunition. The procedure laid down in the draft telegram is intended to secure full opportunity to all claimants for proving their claims, and thus throw full light upon the nature of the trade. The record of the proceedings of the territorial authorities and of any subsequent proceedings taken by the Resident at Bushire or by the Consul at Muscat will supply valuable material for dealing with any representations which may possibly be made here, and after a suitable interval the question of final possession of the intercepted arms can be arranged without difficulty.

East India Chambers, 23, Leadenhall Street, London, E.C., Sir, 31st January 1898. Our attention has been called to the enclosed newspaper* paragraph dealing with the action of the Govern- ri*t^\ ar ’” 28th January 1898 ' ( ' Not ment in respect of the S.S. “Balu- ^ nn e chistan,” and thereupon arguing to the same end in respect of the steamer “ Tripoli,” with which vessel we are concerned as charterers (not as managers) for her present voyage. The suggestion in the newspaper paragraph that the Government should deal with the “ Tripoli ” in the same way as it was found necessary to deal with the “ Baluchistan ” can, we assume, only have been made by the writer of the paragraph in complete ignorance of the facts as they concern the 4&lt; Tripoli.” We think it only right to express to you the circumstances affecting the “ Tripoli,” firstly, on the grounds of the interest which the same may have for the Government, and, secondly, for the consequences to us under our responsibilities as charterers of the steamer, should any unusual proceedings be directed by the Government against the S.S. “ Tripoli.” It may be unnecessary and superfluous for us to write you in this connection, but we are apprehensive, in view of the interest being shown over the “ Baluchistan ” affair, lest our steamer “ Tripoli ” should, from insufficient knowledge with the Government, be deemed to be carrying on some irregular course of action prejudicial to British interests in respect of the arms and ammunition which have been shipped on board this steamer. We desire rather to assist the Government with the fullest possible infor mation in so far as the Government may wish to have such information, and our manifests, correspondence, and all particulars relating to the cargo on board are entirely at the service of the Government in the event of your wishing to have reference to the same. We have to point out that there has been no secrecy or subterfuge in any shape or form of which we have knowledge in respect of the arms and ammunition shipped in the “ Tripoli,” and our Agents at Manchester have adopted the regular procedure in reporting at the Customs as to the description and destination of the cargo shipped, and doubtless the shippers of the cargo have in like manner furnished the usual shippers’ declaration as to the value, description, and destination of the goods. The newspaper paragraph conveys misstatements as to the circumstances generally, and particularly in the reference to the steamer calling at Djibouti. We do not deem it necessary in this letter to trouble you with corrections of the inaccuracies of the newspaper correspondent, but we should prefer, as we have already indicated, to place at your disposal all such information as we possess with regard to the cargo of the S.S. “ Tripoli ” if it would bo of any service or interest to your Department, and so as to obviate any trouble arising with the S.S. “ Tripoli ” in the course of her voyage by the interference of Her Majesty’s ships of war through inaccurate or incomplete information as to the nature of her cargo. We beg to apologise for troubling you with this communication, but we do so upon the grounds set forth above in this letter, and we shall feel obliged if you will let us know whether the Government intend to offer any objection to the trading in which the “ Tripoli ” is engaged on this voyage after you have the full details of the business such as we shall lay before you. The “Tripoli” is now in, or has passed through, the Suez Canal, and proceeds to Jeddah to discharge part cargo, thence to Djibouti where she will discharge 1,800 tons of railway material, afterwards proceeding to Muscat to land merchandise, including 46 cases of guns and cartridges, thence to places in the Persian Gulf terminating at Bussorah, to discharge ordinary merchandise.We beg to ask your early reply hereon, and we have only to add that it will afford us satisfaction either to show all particulars here to anyone from your Department, or to call upon you at such time as you may appoint in connection with this matter.

The following procedure regarding arms seized on “ Baluchistan ” or other Political British vessels should be followed. First, the territorial authorities in whose No - 282/98. waters seizure is effected must hold a formal inquiry, which Consul should watch. If the evidence as to illicit traffic satisfies him, he can hold the arms temporarily for the Governments concerned. Secondly, if after decision of territorial authorities complaints are lodged at Consulate, Consul can require full evidence to disprove illicit traffic, and record his proceedings. He can either decline to interfere, or advise the territorial authorities to revise their decision. His inquiries should elucidate all facts, and copies of proceedings of the territorial and of the Consular authorities can be sent here. The question of ultimate title to the arms seized can be reserved until these proceedings are completed, and the claims of the Governments concerned as well as of others fully represented. No. 23.

T enclosing “full particulars concerning * No. 23. the arms and ammunition shipped on “ board the steamer e Tripoli,’ ” I am directed to observe that the Secretary of State for India has been informed that, in addition to the shipments entered in your list, other cases of arms and ammunition were sent in that vessel to the' Persian Gulf. Your list accounts for 25 cases shipped by Messrs. Hollis which, it is understood, contained 60,000 cartridges and 270 rifles and arms, 20 cases shipped by Messrs. Laubenburg which contained 72,000 cartridges and 474 rifles, and' one case shipped by Mr. Spencer. But, according to other information received by the Secretary of State, the “ Tripoli ” carried 38,000 cartridges and 52 rifles shipped by two other firms. It is possible that at the last moment these cases were withdrawn. But if they were not, I am to inquire whether in respect to them the same procedure was adopted by the shippers, namely, concealment of the names of the consignees and omission from the Bills of Lading of the contents, “merchandize” or “ hardware ” being entered in place of cartridges or rifles. As you are aware, the traffic in arms and ammunition to certain ports in the Persian Gulf is forbidden by their rulers; and if Her Majesty’s Government is asked to use its influence to protect a trade in Foreign or British arms exported from British ports, it is necessary to be satisfied that those engaged in the traffic were not seeking to evade the law. I have, &amp;c., Messrs. Bucknall Brothers. O. B. Newmarch.Messrs. Bucknall Brothers to India Office. East India Chambers, 23, Leadenhall Street, London, E.C., Sir, 9th February 1898. Re S.S. “ Tripoli/’ We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 555 dated 5th instant, and „ __ we reply herein to the various obser- ' * vations you have made in connection with the subject of the arms and ammunition shipped on board the above steamer. • 1 . So far as we have any knowledge, we are not aware that any other cases of arms and ammunition than those entered in the list accompanying our letter to you of 3rd instant were shipped in the S.S. “ Tripoli ’’ for the Persian Gulf or for any other destination. 2. We have no information which enables us to comment as to the contents of the 25 cases shipped by Messrs. J. Hollis &amp; Co., and the 20 cases shipped by Messrs. Laubenberg &amp; Co., and the single case shipped by Mr. Spencer, the details of which are furnished in your letter. 3. We have no knowledge of such a shipment as 38,000 cartridges and 52 rifles which, according to other information received by you, the S.S. ** Tripoli ” is reported to have carried, and we think we are correct in stating that this report will be found to be without foundation. We observe that you make reference to the possibility that at the last moment these cases may have been withdrawn, and in this connection it may be of interest to note the following fact, which may have given currency to the report as to their alleged shipment. 4. There were 17 cases guns and cartridges brought from Antwerp in the steamers “ Whimbrel ” and “ Ibis ” consigned for shipment at Manchester in the S.S. “ Tripoli.” These goods were for account of Messrs. E. W. Carling &amp; Co., London, but they were not shipped, in consequence of being stopped at Manchester by Her Majesty’s Customs through some informality, as we are informed, under the Merchandise Marks Act. 5. The shippers have informed us that the contents of the 17 cases were :— 11 cases containing 39,000 cartridges. 6 cases containing about 170 rifles. 6 . If Messrs. Carling’s goods had been shipped, they would have been in the bills of lading to “ Order.” 7. We observe your remarks in connection with the circumstance of certain shippers making out bills of lading to “ Order,” without giving on this side the names of consignees, but we may be permitted to point out that this practice is quite usual, and it does not necessarily involve that there has been concealment on the part of the shippers. Almost the entire cargo of the S.S. “ Tripoli ” would be so consigned to “ Order.” 8 . Nor does the term “merchandise” in the body of the bills of lading constitute any misdescription, inasmuch as it is usual when shippers make out bills of lading for them, for brevity’s sake, to describe goods as “merchandise ” in the body of the bill of lading, and the goods may or may not be particularised or more exactly described in the margin of the bill of lading, but in any case we always require a description of the contents to be declared to us for the purpose of computing freight, and this description is then shown by us in the “ export manifest ” which is deposited at the Political 1751/98.custom house after the clearance of the steamer. The shippers also deposit “ specification” with more or less detail of the shipments made to correspond with the aforesaid “ manifest.” It is not usual for the term “ hardware ” to he used in connection with the shipment of such goods as arms and m munition. 9. We have taken careful note of the regulations affecting the traffic in arms and ammunition with the Persian Gulf as set forth in your letter. This information, together with an advice received by us on 5th instant from Muscat of a notification issued there by Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, dated 13th January 1898, will enable us to exclude arms and ammunition in our future sailings of steamers for the ports concerned. 10. It is the first time that we are made acquainted with the com prehensive range of the prohibition, as at the end of December last we were simply informed by our agents in the Persian Gulf that the importation of arms and ammunition had been prohibited at Bushire, which step we then understood was simply the result of local disturbances, and by no means of the nature of an Imperial order. Are we now to understand that arms and ammunition will not be allowed landing either at Muscat ? 11. Under the circumstances as fully set forth in this and our previous letters, we trust there will be no interference or trouble or delay caused to the S.S. “ Tripoli ” by any action on the part of Her Majesty’s Govern ment, but that Her Majesty’s Government will be content to allow, and will authorise, the steamer to proceed immediately she has discharged the guns and cartridges into lighters at the port of Muscat, which presumably will be all that is left for the steamer to do, and Her Majesty’s Government will thereupon direct their action to the lighter. 12. It may be that the shippers of arms and ammunition, if they are also aware of the prohibition now ruling at Muscat, will seek to intercept the steamer at the previous port of Djibuti, where steamer calls, and take delivery of these goods at that place, in which event the steamer would arrive at Muscat with a less quantity of, or without any, arms or ammunition on board. We presume Her Majesty’s Government would have no objection to this course being taken, but at present the shippers have not made any overtures to us in respect of taking possession of their goods at Djibuti. We trust to be favoured with an early reply hereon, and we have the honour to remain, Sir, Yours, &amp;c.. The Under Secretary of State Bucknall Brotheks. for India. No. 26. India Office to Messrs. Bucknall Brothers. India Office, Gentlemen, 10th February 1898. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th * No - 25 - instant.* 2. The explanation given in paragraph 4 of your letter accounts for the withdrawal, at the last moment, of certain cases of arms intended to be shipped from Manchester by Messrs. Carling &amp; Co. The other shipment referred to in my letter of the 5th of February appears to be that described in the foot-note to the enclosure to your letter of the 3 rd instant, as shipped by Lynch Brothers. There remains then one entry which it is difficult to explain, and which has a material bearing upon the main contention putforward in your letter of the 31st of January, to the effect that “ there has “ been no secrecy or subterfuge in any shape or form of which we have “ knowledge.” 3. The case of rifles shown in your list marked M G H, as shipped to order by A. W. Spencer, was, according to information received by this Office, shipped by E. W. Carling &amp; Co., and it is believed that the bill of lading described the contents as hardware. If this impression is correct, it would seem that, in addition to the concealment of the consignee’s name, the exporter’s name was also left back. 4, I am to inquire whether further light can be thrown on this point, because, as you are aware, the action which is being taken by the territorial authorities in the Gulf, with which you are asking Her Majesty’s Govern ment to interfere, is based upon the fact that this traffic in arms is illegal, and the assumption that the parties engaged in it are well aware of the risks which they incur if their action is discovered. I have, &amp;c., Messrs. Bucknall Brothers. A. Godley. No. 27. Letter from Government of India to the Bight Honourable Lord George E. Hamilton, Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India.

If Foreign Office concur in interpretation of article, may I authorise Consul to pro ceed ? ” Maskat territory to India and Persia, Port TTilliam, 10th February 1898. your Lordship on the 4th February Political 1898, a proposal to make compulsory No. 295/98. on British subjects the registration, at our Consulate at Maskat, of arms im ported into or owned by them in Maskat territories. The suggestion was made by our Political Besident in the Persian Gulf with a view to check ing the arms trade. A copy of the Besident’s telegram, dated the 27th January 1898, is enclosed. It further suggests that the export of arms and ammunition by British subjects, from should be made a penal offence. 2 . Article 1 of the Maskat Order in Council, 1867, appears to us sufficient to enable the Consul to make rules providing for the registration of arms by British subjects in Maskat. Such rules would be “ for the peace, order “ and good government of Her Majesty’s subjects being within the domi- “ nions of the Sultan of Maskat,” although their immediate object would be of a different kind. Under Article 2 of the Order, such rules can be enforced in anticipation of their allowance by Her Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; but they cannot 'be enforced without preliminary publication for one calendar month. It appears, however, from papersf received with the letter from the Secretary in the Political and Secret Department, No. 2, dated the 14th January 1898, that Article 1 of the Maskat Order in Council has been under the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and it may be inferred that the suggestion in respect to compulsory registration of arms and ammunition by British subjects either did not occur to or did not f See Letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office, dated the 3rd January 1898, and the reply Irom the Foreign Office, dated the 7th January 1898.20 commend itself to Lord Salisbury. Under these circumstances, we are of opinion that the Consul should not mov r e in the matter of framing a rule until we are in a position to instruct him as to the views of Her Majesty’s Government. 3. The Political Kesident duly presented to the Sultan a request in the terms set forth in your Lordship’s telegram of the 21st December 1897, and we forward herewith a copy of Colonel • No. 3 a, dated the 22nd January 1898, Meade’s report* showing the action with accompaniments. ta t eil by the Sultan. We recognise that, as pointed out in the above-quoted letter of the 7th January 1898 from the Foreign Office to the India Office, the arrangement acquiesced in by the Sultan, under which His Highness has warned his own subjects against the exportation of arms and ammunition, cannot be regarded as amounting to a “ Treaty or Convention.” Nor can exportation from Maskat with the intention to import in an illicit manner into Persia or India be contrary to the interests of the 44 peace, order and good government of Her Majesty’s subjects, being within the dominions of the Sultan.” Conse quently we concluded that the Consul has not authority tp make rules and regulations penalising the export of arms and ammunition by British subjects. Something may, however, be done to check the trade by requiring the registration of our Maskat Consulate of arms and ammunition imported into or owned in the Sultan’s dominions by British subjects. We therefore recommended to your Lordship’s consideration this part of the Besident’s proposals. 4. We are taking such action as appears possible in respect to that portion of the Political Besident’s telegram of the 27th January 1898, which refers to exports from Maskat to the neighbourhood of Karachi and to the activity of Pathan agents.

During the negotiations that resulted in His Highness consenting to do this, he asked me whether he would be given the arms seized in his waters, and said he was apprehensive that he would suffer in a pecuniary way from the proposed arrangements. I impressed on him that his own authority would certainly benefit if he could prevent the arming of the Arab tribes in the interior, and that that alone was, in my opinion, a strong reason in favour of his joining the British and Persian Governments in putting an end to the traffic in arms. I added that I had received no instructions as to the disposal of arms seized and could not guarantee His Highness against loss. At the same time, however, in view of the advantages which would result from the early conclusion of an agreement with the Sultan, I felt justified in telling him that I was prepared to make recommendations on his behalf, if he readily complied with the wishes of the British Government who were, I knew, kindly disposed towards him and did not wish that he should suffer in any way, but, on the contrary, that he should benefit by carrying out their views. 3. I gathered that His Highness puts down his revenue from the duties levied on the import and export of arms at #24,000 a year; but he did not say exactly to what extent he thought his income would suffer from the agreement he has now entered into, nor could I ascertain during my visit if it will really entail any actual loss. The Political Agent is making inquiries on these points, and I will submit definite recommendations later on. Enclosure 1 in above.

Be it known to such of our subjects as see this, that whereas the British and Persian Governments have represented to us that they are desirous of preventing introduction of arms and ammunition into India and Persia, and that there is reason to think that many are exported from Maskat and taken to those two above-named countries, we have resolved to join them and to assist them as far as it lies in our power in suppressing this trade in arms and ammunition between Maskat and India and Persia. We therefore warn (our subjects) that all the arms and ammunition sent to those two countries will be confiscated and those engaged in this trade will be punished, as the introduction of arms and ammunition into India and Persia is prohibited by the Governments of those two countries and therefore illegal. In future our Maskat flag will be no protection to vessels carrying the said arms and ammunition from our dominions to India and Persia. (This is written) that it may be known. And salaams.

Beferring to the conversation which Mr. Harman had with Mr. Lee- Warner on the 11 th instant, we beg to call your attention to the following facts: — We have reason to believe that large quantities of foreign-made ammu nition are being brought into Manchester, and probably other ports in the United Kingdom, for transhipment to ports in the Persian Gulf. The goods originally are marked “ made in Belgium ” or “ made abroad.” These marks are erased or planed out, either on the boat or on the quay at the port oftranshipment. The goods are then transhipped to Muscat and other ports containing English words and English trade descriptions only. We submit that this action of the merchants engaged in' this trade con stitutes a violation, both of the Merchandise Marks Act and of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, its effect being that foreign goods are sold in Persia and other ports as English-made goods. We think it only right, in the interests of British trade generally, and in our own interests as large manufacturers of ammunition, to call your attention to this illegal trade, and we trust that you will see your way to bring pressure to bear upon the parties concerned, through the instru mentality of the Customs authorities and of the Consuls at the foreign ports.

Mr. Hardinge to the Marquess of Salisbury. No. 3. Tehran, My Lord, 5th January 1898. Immediately upon the receipt of your Lordship’s telegram No. 3, of Political the 8 th December, I called upon the Sadr Azam and the Minister for No - 1 '775/98. Foreign Affairs, and informed them of the measures which your Lordship proposed should be taken to put a stop to the importation of arms into Persia, a traffic which was illegal and equally injurious to British and Persian interests. The Sadr Azam informed me that this question had for some time engaged his attention, as the continued importation of arms presented great danger to the Persian Government, owing to the arming of the tribes in the south, who possessed arms of precision of as good a pattern as those with which the Persian troops were armed. His Highness stated that he could see no objection to your Lordship’s proposals, which would be of great, assistance to the Persian Government, and he begged me to address a note to him in that sense as soon as possible which he could submit to the Shah for His Majesty’s orders. I urged upon His Highness at the same time the necessity of proceeding at once with the confiscation of arms already imported into Bushire, whether the property of British or Persian subjects. As soon as I had received your Lordship’s telegram of the 10th December authorising me to omit in my communication to the Persian Government any suggestion as to the issue of permits by the Persian Legation and Consular officers which I feared might, owing to the venality of Persian officials, become a source of danger and render nugatory the action of Her Majesty’s ships, I addressed a note to the Persian Government in the sense of your Excellency’s instructions, copy of which I have the honour to enclose herewith. This note was laid before the Shah, and upon the 16th ultimo the Sadr Azam informed me that the Shah and the Persian Government had agreed to authorise Her Majesty’s ships to seize and hand over to the Persian authorities for confiscation, all cargoes of arms and ammunition owned by British or Persian subjects which might be found in Persian waters destined for illicit importation, and that the Persian Government was quite ready to join with Her Majesty’s Government in making a representation to the Government of Muscat in the sense of your Lordship’s telegram. The Sadr Azam asked me at the same time to obtain your Lordship’s authorisation to request the commanders of Her Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf to commence operations at once, as they had received infor mation of the expected arrival within a short space of time of a considerable consignment of arms and ammunition, of which they are most anxious to prevent the importation.24 Two days later I received the official reply of the Sadr Azam to my note in the sense of what His Highness had already told me, and I have the honour to enclose a copy herewith. On receiving your Lordships telegram No. 41 of the 20th ultimo, containing the text of^ the^proposed joint communication to the Government of Muscat, I lost no time in submitting to the Persian Government the text in Persian, and I have now received from the Sadr Azam the communication of the Persian Government to the Government of Muscat in almost the terms of your Lordship’s telegram and signed by His Highness. A copy in translation of the Persian text is herewith enclosed. I shall, in accordance with your Lordship’s instructions, transmit this document by the Legation Gholam, who leaves in two days’ time, to Her Majesty’s Consulate General in Bushire to be forwarded to the British Agent in Muscat. arms and ammunition are being exported from Great Britain to the southern ports of Persia, and also to Muscat and Bahrein, from which places they are smuggled across into Persia. Her Majesty s Government have reason to believe that a considerable portion of tliese consignments find their way into Afghanistan and eventually reach the tribes on the North-Western frontier of India. The importation of arms into Persia being strictly prohibited, this traffic is illegal and as contrary to Persian as it is to British interests. I have therefore received instructions from the Marquess of Salisbury to inquire of your Excellency wdiether, with a view to stopping this illicit traffic, the Persian Government will allow Her Majesty’s ships of war to seize and hand over to the Persian authorities for confiscation all cargoes of arms and ammunition owned by British or Persian subjects which may be found in Persian w'aters destined for importation into Persia. In the event of the importation of arms or ammunition for the use of the Persian Government a notification to Her Majesty’s Legation would be sufficient to prevent seizure by Her Majesty’s ships. I am also instructed to inquire of the Persian Government whether they will join Her Majesty’s Government in requesting the Sultan of Muscat to issue a notice warning his subjects and others residing in Muscat from exporting arms and ammunition to Persia or British India, as the importation of such merchandise into those countries is strictly prohibited, and asking that British ships of war may be permitted to take action in the waters of Muscat for preventing such traffic by the subjects of Great Britain, Persia, and Muscat. I shall be much obliged if your Excellency will favour me with an early reply for communication to Her Majesty’s Government.

Enclosure 2 in 29.25 opinion of the British Government, that the importation of arms and ammunition into Persia should be strictly prohibited, is shared by the Persian Government; this Gpvernment has always sought to prevent the arming of the tribesmen as well as the inhabitants of the towns and frontiers. Since in this matter the opinions of the two Governments are in unison, and as the measures to he taken are in many respects similar, the Govern ment is prepared with the most perfect unanimity to meet the views of Her Britannic Majesty’s Legation; further, the wishes of Her Majesty’s Govern ment, viz., that in addition to such measures as may he taken by Persian officials, Her Majesty’s ships should examine and search all merchant vessels trading in the Persian Gulf, and confiscate and hand over to the Persian Government all prohibited arms found on board, are approved by His Imperial Majesty the Shah. Should arms or ammunition be purchased to the order of the Persian Government, information of such purchases will be given to Her Britannic Majesty’s Legation, so that such arms may he beyond the effects of the prohibition. The Persian Government is also ready to join with Her Majesty’s Govern ment in requesting the Sultan of Muscat to notify in the ports and territories of Muscat that arms should not be imported from that side into Persia or Hindustan, also that English ships should exercise in regard to search and confiscation the same rights in Muscat as in Persian waters. Enclosure 3 in No. 29. Joint communication to the Sultan of Muscat. Translation of Persian Text. The British Government, and the Government of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, are informed that arms and ammunition are being imported into Persia from the territories of Muscat and its dependencies, and it is believed they are by this means surreptitiously distributed among the tribes subject to Persia, and obtained by the same means and road by the tribes on the frontier of India who are engaged in hostilities with the British Government. Any such traffic in arms and ammunition, and other munitions of war, is contrary to the existing law of the Persian and British Indian Governments; and, accordingly, the two Governments unite in requesting the Sultan of Muscat to warn his subjects, and all 'persons resident in his territories, to refrain from exporting the articles mentioned from His Highness’s dominions to Persia or British Indian ports. His Highness’s authority is therefore invited, in order that British and Persian ships of war may be authorised to stop the illicit traffic, and to seize and confiscate any cargoes of arms owned by British or Persian or Muscat subjects which may be found in Muscat waters destined for illicit importation into the ports of Persia or India.

We regret the writer has been prevented replying earlier in this matter. 2. With reference to your quoting, from our letter of 31st January, as follows:—“ There has been no secrecy or subterfuge in any shape or form of which we have knowledge,” we have to confirm this statement, and we deal, in the following paragraph, with the shipment in the name of A. W. Spencer, so far as we are concerned, and to which you refer. 3. The case of rifles was delivered to the steamer at Manchester in the usual course by Messrs. E. W. Carling &amp; Co., and by them the name of the shipper, A. W. Spencer, was inserted in bills of lading. This fact would not call for any observation on tlie part of our Manchester agents, as it would merely appear that in this instance Messrs. E. W. Carling &amp; Co. were acting as agents on behalf of A. W. Spencer, and our agents would have no other interest or concern in the matter for us other than to collect the freight due on the shipment. With regard to the description in the B/L, we should regret if there has been any error on the part of our agents, but we do not keep any file in our office here of copies of B/L issued at Manchester in connection with our steamers in this trade, and we have, • therefore, had to rely upon our Manchester agents, Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey, &amp; Co., to furnish the documents, which were supplied to you with our letter of 31st January. Our agents have explained to us that they happened to possess copies of B/L for the various shipments, except the shipment of A. W T . Spencer, so they made out from memory what they believed to be an accurate copy of the B/L which had been issued in respect of this shipment of A. W. Spencer, and that copy is now in your possession. W T hether it was described in B/L as “ hardware ” or as “ merchandise ” we are consequently unable now to give precise information. We cannot offer any explanation ourselves as regards Messrs. E. W. Carling &amp; Co. inserting the name of A. W. Spencer as shipper, nor can we form any opinion whether their action involved, as you describe it, “ a concealment of the consignees’ name, as well as keeping back the exporters’ name,” as there was nothing unusual in their treatment of the details with us concerning this shipment, and, as we have explained, the names are not material to us except for the purpose of getting our freight paid. There appears to have been no conceal ment by Messrs. Carling of the fact that the shipment consisted of arms, for this fact v r as declared to our agents by Messrs. Carling, and our agents in due course deposited the manifest at Her Majesty s Customs, with the same ► particulars which they received from the shippers. 4. We regret we cannot throw any further light on the point affecting this shipment of A. W. Spencer’s. We would, however, again repeat that it is our wish to afford every possible assistance to Her Majesty’s Government in giving the fullest information that is at our disposal concerning this and the other shipments in the S.S. “ Tripoli.” 5 . With regard to your concluding remarks under this paragraph, we do not apprehend that there is anything illegal bearing upon our position as charterers of S.S. “Tripoli,” and in our carrying these arms to the port of Muscat, nor w-ould our carrying the arms to, and discharging them at, Muscat interfere with or conflict with any action which is being taken by the territorial authorities in the Gulf to prevent the importation oi arms and ammunition into Persia and British India. A\ e submit that it is in the further forwarding of the arms and ammunition from Muscat that anyillegality in the traffic can be involved. If we rightly apprehend the situation, we are not asking Her Majesty’s Government to interfere for us ■where there is any illegality in the traffic, but our object in these communi cations has been to make you acquainted with the fact of the “ Tripoli ” carrying such cargo, and to avoid any erroneous conclusions as to the part the steamer has in the traffic, so that no interference or delay may be caused to the steamer on her voyage by any action on the part of Her Majesty’s ships of war or other authorities, seeing that any arrest of the goods, if such should, be determined upon, can be, and should be, effected upon the goods ■when they are put into lighter at Muscat after having been discharged from the steamer. 6 . We beg that you will now inform us whether there is any prohibition existing against carrying arms and ammunition to Muscat; and, if so, under what laws or regulations this prohibition comes into force. We have before us a copy of “ Notification ” (as attached hereto) issued by Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Muscat bearing upon the question, but it does not appear to us that this Notification touches the point as to carrying arms to Muscat, but specifically deals with the intended distribution, i.e., the destination of the arms after they have arrived at Muscat. It will not be necessary for us to point out to you that we, as carriers, have no knowledge whatever as to the intention of the owners of these goods, nor can we rightly be regarded, while being concerned solely in our capacity of carriers, as falling within 44 those engaged in the traffic,” as expressed in the Muscat Notification. That term must obviously have been used by Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul to reach those persons engaged in the buying or selling or distribution of these goods from Muscat to the prohibited regions defined in the Notification, as Persia and British India. We believe that others engaged in the carrying trade continue to ship arms and ammunition destined for Muscat, but not beyond. 7. If there should be any illegality in such carrying, we should wish to be acquainted with the enactments thereon, as, from all the information we have been able to obtain, no such prohibition against the carrying to Muscat has been promulgated, and, in the event of the Sultan of Muscat exercising any interference against our steamer “ Tripoli,” we should have to claim, on hehalf of the owners of the steamer and ourselves, that protection which Her Majesty’s Government always extends to the British flag carried by British steamers engaged in lawful trades. 8 .

British subjects are hereby reminded that the importation of arms and ammunition into Persia and British India is forbidden by the Governments of these countries, and is therefore illegal.

Lord Salisbury proposes, with Lord George Hamilton’s concurrence, to approve Mr. Hardinge’s action in this matter. mi tt I am ’ &amp; c -&gt; The Under Secretary of State T. H. Sanderson. for India. Enclosure in No. 32. Mr. Hardinge to the Marquess of Salisbury. No. 172. Tehran My Lord, ^ 3 ^ D ece mber 1897. Although the importation of arms into Persia has nominally been prohibited for several years past there is no doubt that the traffic in arms and ammunition has recently been very considerable and has been rapidly increasing. The principal port of importation is naturally Bushire, and the Governor has hitherto derived a large revenue by imposing a duty of from 8 to 10 per cent, ad valorem on imported arms or by levying a tax of 3 tomans (12 shillings) upon each rifle. It is computed that last year 30,000 rifles were^ imported into Bushire and distributed throughout' the country, Shiraz being the general centre of distribution. In this way the Bakntiaris, Kashgais, Tangastanis, and other tribes are now in possession of excellent arms of precision, and, if united, would be more than a match for any expedition of Persian troops sent against them. The Persian Government being alive to the danger of allowing this state of things to continue, and finding encouragement in the-proposed action of Her Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf, lost no time in issuing a circular note to the Foreign Legations, copy of which I have the honour 3 to enclose in translation, reminding them of the prohibition against the im portation of arms and asking them to warn the subjects of their respective Governments. At the* same time they proceed to seize and confiscate all the arms and ammunition which they were able to discover in Bushire. The Governor of Bushire having shown unwillingness to co-operate in a measure which would inevitably entail a considerable pecuniary loss to himself, the Persian Government deputed one of their officials, the MalekTujar, to undertake the task of seizing and confiscating the arms, and asked me to allow Her Majesty’s Consulate General to co-operate with him. I at once instructed Her Majesty s Consul General to direct JMr. Vice-Consul Gaskin to be present at all the seizures made, and to take a list of the arms seized, so that there might be no doubt as to the complete amount of confiscated arms seized being forwarded to Tehran. The only difficulty experienced in carrying out these operations was the refusal of the Governor to allow the Malek Tuiar and Her Majesty s \ice-Consul to search the Custom House where it was known that a considerable amount of arms were stored. After consultation with the Sadr Azam it was decided by His Highness that the Malek Tuiar accompanied by Mr. Gaskin and a strong guard of sepoys from the British Presidency should proceed to the Custom House and take possession of all the aims that could be found there, and most stringent orders were sent to the Governor to offer no obstruction. I accordingly sent instructions in that sense to Her Majesty’s Consul-General and told him to inform the Governor29 that this action was taken at the express desire of the Sadr Azam, and to warn Mr. Gaskin that all conflict was to be avoided, and that if he foresaw resistance he was to immediately withdraw. The Governor, seeing that further opposition was useless, thereupon offered to co-operate with the Malek Tujar and Mr. Gaskin, and a large number of arms found in the Custom House w r ere seized and confiscated. The seizure of arms whose existence was known in Bushire has now been completed and amounts to 4,826 rifles and about a million rounds of ammunition. Upon the receipt of your Lordship’s* telegram, No. 42, of the 22nd instant, * See No 9 asking for information upon certain points in connection with the seizure of arms, I instructed Lieutenant-Colonel Picot to inquire of the Sadr Azam as to points Nos. 4 and 5 mentioned by your Lordship. I have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a memorandum which I have received from Colonel Picot recording the assurance given by His Highness that the Persian Government would maintain the seizure and confiscation of cargoes of arms if their British owners endeavoured to transfer them to subjects of other Powers, and stating the procedure to be adopted in the case of arms imported by Persian notables for sporting purposes.

The Mushir-ed-Dowleh, Minister of Eoreign Affairs, who assisted at the interview, asked the Sadr Azam what would happen if owners sought to re-ship their cargoes to Europe. The Sadr Azam replied that if the arms had been seized in Persian waters or on Persian soil the Government would refuse to allow re-shipment, and would maintain the seizure.

In reply, I am to inform you that the importation of arms and ammunition into British India, or into Persia, without the permission of the Persian Government, is illegal, and the Sultan 01 Mascat has notified that he will not allow consignments of such arms and ammunition destined for Persia to make use of his territorial waters. The answ'er to your question therefore depends upon the destination of the arms carried to Mascat, and the clearest description of the contents of the cases on the bills of lading, together with the names of the consignees and the real names of the exporters, would no doubt prove a valuable precaution against the seizure through mistake or error of any cases carried by you to Mascat, which the Mascat authorities might not be justified in seizin o’ or confiscating.

No. 19. Tehran, My Lord, 1 st February 1898. The Persian text of the joint communication to the Government of Muscat signed by the Sadr Azam, respecting the importation of arms into Muscat, was duly forwarded to Bushire on the 8 th ultimo. On the 25th ultimo I received information from Her Majesty’s Consul- General in Bushire that the Sultan of Muscat had agreed* to join the British and Persian Governments in putting an end to the traffic in arms. With this object the Sultan of Muscat published a warning to his people informing them that the trade in arms was illegal, and that all arms found would be confiscated. A similar warning w r as given to British subjects in Muscat. The Sultan further gave a WTitten permission to British and Persian vessels of war to seize in Muscat waters British, Persian and Muscat vessels with arms consigned to British and Persian ports, also to seize Muscat vessels in British and Persian waters, and to confiscate the arms found on board. In December last, in accordance with your Lordship’s instructions, I requested the commanders of Her Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf, through the British Resident at Bushire, to do their utmost to intercept and seize in Persian waters the S.S. “ Beluchistan,” wTiich was known to have shipments of arms on board, and I warned them of the attempt that would probably be made to divert the whole cargo of arms to Muscat. The con clusion of the agreement with the Government of Muscat permitted action to be taken by Her Majesty’s ships in the waters of Muscat, and the S.S. “Beluchistan ” was seized on the 24th ultimo by H.M.S. “Lapwing ” near Muscat, and the cargo of arms was handed and made over to the British Consul pending instructions as to their disposal. The seizure of the arms on board the S.S. “ Beluchistan,” together with the seizure of arms already made at Bushire will, I believe, strike a most effective blow at the traffic of arms in the Persian Gulf.2^ 33 As regards the situation of the arms question in Bushire, I have been informed by Her Majesty’s Consul-General that there are undoubtedly still large numbers of arms which have been secreted by British and Native firms, but that it would be extremely difficult to obtain information as to where they have been hidden. I am also informed that the state of feeling in Bushire durin' the recent seizures ran so high that it would be desirable before any further seizures are made that a gun-boat should be present in the harbour while search is made. In the meantime Her Majesty’s Resident has gone to Bahrein, but as soon as Colonel Meade has returned to Bushire I will consult with him as to what measures can safely be taken for the discovery and seizure of any further stores of arms that may be found. The Firman Firma, who, as Governor of Fars and the Gulf ports, farms the revenues of the Customs, has placed every possible obstruction in the way of the seizure of arms, and to my knowledge has endeavoured to bribe the Ministers to cease their opposition to the importation of arms, but without success. His Highness, who undoubtedly has made large profits by the importation of arms, has now announced to'the Persian Government that he has given up the farming of the Customs of the Southern ports.

[Recent events in the Persian Gulf, in connection with the trade in arms and ammunition, are likely to cause ruinous loss to British traders unless some satisfactory settlement is soon arrived at. The grievances are in respect of the action of the British authorities at Bushire, Persia, and at Muscat, an independent State on the Arab coast. As the circumstances and conditions at these ports differ, they need to be dealt with separately, and the situation at Bushire may he taken first. Be Bushire.—Eor many years a regular and considerable trade in arms and ammunition lias been carried on between this country and Bushire. There has been absolutely no secrecy about it; orders have been openly placed with Birmingham and other makers, packages clearly port-marked, and carried openly by railway companies to London, Cardiff, or Manchester for shipment by tlie regular liners sailing direct to the Persian Gulf. Pull details of packages and contents have been declared for Customs clearance, and ship’s manifests issued in accordance therewith. Of the full cognizance of our own Government there can be absolutely no doubt, as, in addition to above, the following extracts from the latest (1896) Bushire Consular Report, issued by the British Foreign Office for the benefit and information of British traders, will prove :— “ Imports: Arms and Ammunition.—Theoretically this trade is prohibited by the Persian Government, but, like all similar prohibitions in Persia, this practically only substitutes an arbitrary impost for a fixed duty, and the large increase in the values shown are mainly duo to higher valuation caused by the raising of this impost by the local authorities, though there was also a slightly increased demand in Dasht and Dashtistan. “ Exports : Arms and Ammunition.—These are really only transhipped in Bushire, but are usually kept a short time before re-shipping, owing to restrictions on account of the nominal embargo on guns; these restrictions were slightly increased, and more arms were imported direct to Muscat and the other markets of the Arab coast, usually fed from Bushire, so the business fell off 4,944Z.” Those reports also give full details and statistics of value and number of packages entered at Bushire and other ports in the Persian GulL In a letter, dated 30th November 1897 (No. 680), the British Resident writes to one of the traders in arms, amongst other things, as follows: — “ The Resident is aware that prohibition to import arms is evaded, and for this reason the Residency has hitherto done nothing to interfere with the action of certain European firms who have, for some time back, been largely engaged in this trade, and have been making enormous profits at it. The only reason why this Residency has not interfered is that, as long as prohibition is not enforced by the Persian authorities, and as long as there is a ready sale for arms in Persia and other neighbouring countries, they will certainly be brought in, and prohibiting English firms from joining in the trade will, as explained by you, only mean its passing into the hands of other nations; the Residency has, therefore, not in any way interfered with British firms, or prevented them from benefiting from this traffic, but this is a different thing to encouraging it.” The remarks as above in the Consular Report by the British Resident at Bushire are, in themselves, a recommendation to British merchants to compete in the trade, and only warns them that the rate of duty on the importation of arms is a fluctuating one. But in spite of these prominent public records, it has been contended that the Persian Government prohibited the importation, and even suggested that they were unaware of the fact, that arms were being imported. These theories cannot be upheld when the actual facts are examined. Provincial Government in Persia is carried on by appointment, from Teheran, of Governors to administer certain districts. These Governors are36 paid no salary, but, on the contrary, are required to guarantee a fixed payment per annum to the Shah, reimbursing themselves out of the Customs and other sources of revenue, the whole of which they pocket. It is well known and admitted that the Governorship, which includes the port of Bushire, is valued at a high rate on account of the extra profits derived from the “ arbitrary imposts ’’ levied on arms imported; without this branch of trade, the revenue would largely decrease ; and in exacting from their representatives a value for the post, inclusive of and dependent upon the revenue derived from arms, the Teheran Government directly sanctions the trade and benefits thereby. It is not, and cannot be, denied that duty has been paid to the duly appointed representatives of the Shah ; audit is absurd to contend that the Shah or his Government were ignorant of what was being done, in view of the above-stated facts, and that our Foreign Office reports are freely circulated in Teheran, as in other parts of Persia, and that everybody else in the country knew of the trade, which has in fact, at times, formed the subject of diplomatic communication between the representatives of the Shah’s Government and our own. Moreover, in respect of whatever may be said as to a prohibition having at any time been promulgated, it must be remembered that prohibitions of various kinds are common enough in Persia; but they are employed merely as pretexts for exacting “ arbitrary imposts ” instead of a fixed duty, e.g., it is a common prac.tice in Bushire to prohibit the exportation of wheat when grain is plentiful enough to leave a balance for shipment, but this in no wise stops the business, and merchants have to learn to accommodate themselves to the circumstances and make the best terms they can. Such a chance of increasing their receipts would seldom be omitted by the ruling powers. Having thus conclusively shown that the trade has been openly carried on and permitted for many years, to the knowledge of both British and Persian Governments, and that, so far as shippers are concerned, everythin «* has been perfectly straightforward and aboveboard, any charge of illicit trading, or suggestion of smuggling, or other underhand action, Inust surely be dropped. How then can the recent seizure of arms and ammunition, lawful merchandise, in Bushire be justified ? The facts regarding this seizure are as follows :—The Persian Government being informed there were large stocks in Bushire, after openly permittino* the entry of the goods and receiving payment of duty on them* determined with the active assistance of the British authorities to improve the occasion by also getting possession of the goods without paying for them. Instruc tions were therefore sent by the Teheran Government to an official at Bushire to enter the warehouses of all merchants at Bushire and seize and confiscate any arms found. The British Consulate, acting under instructions, took a prominent part in the seizure and superintended the removal of the goods from traders go-downs to the Persian official’s premises. There the matter stands to this day, and British traders are unable to ^et any satisfaction whatever, either by a hearing of their case and the restoration of their property, or by payment or compensation, for the goods unjustly seized. # . Muscat .—Then as to Muscat. The trade with this port has been conducted in exactly the same manner as with Bushire, everything has been straight forward and aboveboard. But at Muscat there is no question of prohibition, nominal or otherwise, yet we hear that the S.S. “ Baluchistan ” has been stopped off this port by a British gunboat, and a portion of the cargo seized, although her owners say she had instructions to land all arms, &amp;c., there! and not to take any to Persian Ports. ith what justice did the “ Lapwing ” seize this vessel before she had discharged at Muscat, and the cargo, which, although possibly originally intended for Bushire, was diverted by shippers to Muscat, when the/heard of the difficulties at Bushire, which news did not reach them until after the “ Baluchistan ” had sailed P Bef 01 e shipment a special examination of each package is usually made in Manchester by our Government officials, the packages are opened by them, contents inspected and permission for their shipment accorded. Surely, then! it would have been in accordance with British ideas of justice for theauthorities to have stopped the goods here, before the sailing of the “Baluchistan,” if they had just cause for stopping them at all. Can there he justification lor the action of our Government in allowing this vessel to sail after the fullest and clearest declaration and inspection of her cargo and its destination, and then giving instructions to seize shipments when the vessel was on her way ? Respecting the ultimate destination of the goods, there have been numerous assertions and suggestions in the press that these arms were shipped to, or for, the “ Afridis,” but no proof whatever has been offered ; on the contrary, such arms as have been taken from these tribes have, by military experts, been pronounced as of British Government manufacture, and those of us* who have resided for some years in the Persian Gulf, and know the enormous difficulties of transport from the Gulf to Northern India, to say nothin' of the numerous tribes on the route with constant inter-tribal feuds, ^are strongly of opinion that none of these shipments have reached that quarter ; and again, all those concerned in the trade unanimously aver that during the last 12 months the demand has been very poor indeed, and stocks at all ports have increased, month by month, until there has come such a glut that it is scarcely possible to sell, even at cost price. Surely this would not be the case if the rifles could be, and were, easily despatched to the Northern Frontier. It is well known that there is a considerable manufacture of rifles, &amp;c., in Afghanistan, is it not probable that this is another source of the tribesmen’s supply, rather than the remote Persian Gulf ? Have we not also read in the press of thefts from various depots in India, and also of the capture from our own troops of rifles and ammunition, would not these possibly account for a supply of Lee-Metfords, of which, by the way, to our knowledge, not more than a handful has ever been shipped to the Gulf ? Besides, the u Central News ” gave the following authoritative statement about the source of the tribesmen’s arms in a communication dated Calcutta, 8 th February, as follows :— “ The special report which the authorities of the Government Arsenal at Rawal Pindi were called upon to furnish upon arms captured or surrendered in the Mohmand or Malakand Expeditions, reveals an extraordinary state of things. It has been proved that with the exception of only 13 weapons, all the rifles obtained from these tribes were either stolen from our regiments in India, or were reconstructed locally from component parts of Indian Government rifles which were supposed to have been destroyed in accordance with standing regulations.”— Central News. In addition to this, it is a fact that the Shahzada 'whilst in this country bought a considerable quantity of Martinis and magazine rifles from the Birmingham Small Arms Company, and it would be very interesting indeed to find out where these rifles now are. If the British Government consider the export of arms from England to the Persian Gulf or Muscat or anywhere else to the detriment of their interest, then they could at once have put a stop to the trade by issuing a Privy Council notice prohibiting such export from this country, and then merchants would have abided by such notice. This trade to the Persian Gulf has been carried on for years, long before the recent outbreak on the Indian frontier; it has always been understood by traders that the rifles were mainly sold to the various tribes bordering the Arab coast, and chiefly to Arabs coming from interior to Muscat; why, then, should it now be concluded that the supply is wanted for much remoter districts, when there are regular buyers near at hand ? Without question, shipments have largely increased during the past few years, but it is very doubtful if the actual trade has increased, as the large stock and difficulty of sale go to prove ; the explanation of increased shipments being that wffiere two or three years ago there were only three or four exporters, now there are about 20 , all keenly competing, with the result that the market is greatly over supplied. As to the nature of the business itself, it is true that any foreign nation or country may at some time become our enemy, but that does not prevent our shipbuilders and others from accepting orders for warships and war S. 8. K38 Political 1820/98. materials of all descriptions, nor is any stigma attached to them for so doing. In what respect then does this trade differ from the supply of war vessels to Japan, or rifles, &amp;c. to China or Djibouti and the Transvaal; whilst the trade now under discussion was with Persia and Muscat, two countries with which we are in profound peace ? If our Government desired to stop the trade, why did they not say so to shipowners, who more than once have consulted them respecting the traffic ? Even then the question arises of the scope of their power at Muscat. If our Government wishes to stop shipments from this country, they cannot prevent foreign vessels carrying on the trade, and the effect would merely be that a lucrative Birmingham industry would be ruined, to the benefit of Belgian and German makers, who are already largely interested and will delight in this check to British commerce.

Enclosure in Eoreign Office Letter of 7th March 1898. Eoreign Office to Messrs. Eracis Times and others. Eoreign Office, Gentlemen, 7th March 1898. I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 25th of Eebruary 1898 regarding certain measures taken in the Persian Gulf and on Persian soil to prevent the importation of arms and ammunition, which have had the effect of interfering with the traffic in those articles conducted by your respective firms. The main contentions put forward in the statement which accompanies your letter are as follows :— That there has been “ absolutely no secrecy about this traffic ”; That British officers both at British ports and in the Gulf have been cognisant of the trade and have practically permitted it; That the Persian Government directly sanctions the trade and benefits thereby; That British interests are not affected injuriously by it; and That a lucrative Birmingham industry will be ruined by such inter ference. I am to state in reply that Lord Salisbury is unable to admit that no secrecy has been practised in the conduct of this trade. The contents of cases containing rifles and cartridges have habitually been concealed in the bills of lading under the misleading description of “ merchandize or ‘‘ hard ware ”; the names of the consignees have been withheld by consigning the articles “ to order,” and the information recently given in answer to direct inquiries on the subject has been unsatisfactory and incorrect. The allegation that the trade has been recognised by British officers in Persia rests upon the fact that it is mentioned in certain Consular reports. These reports, however, expressly state that the traffic was prohibited by lawful authority but that the prohibition was evaded by the collusion of the local Customs officials. The Memorandum adds that “ before shipment a special examination of “ each package is usually made at Manchester by our Government officials “ and permission for their shipment accorded; ” and the question is put whether there can be justification for the action of Her Majesty s Government in seizing the “ Biluchistan ” when she had been allowed to sail from this country “ after the fullest and clearest declaration of her cargo and its destination.” On this I am to observe that the inquiries made in Manchester respecting the “ Biluchistan ” did in fact result in establishing a presumption that the cargo was intended for illicit importation into Persia. There were no grounds on which the vessel or its contents could have legally been detained here; but so far from “ permission ” for her voyage having been accorded, it appears that on the 23rd of December Messrs. Strick and Company wrote to this Office to represent their anxiety lest the cases of arms should be seized on arrival in the Gulf. On the following day they were asked to furnish full statements showing the names of the exporters and consignees and the ports of destination, together with copies of the bills of lading. This information they expressed themselves unable to give, but the ship nevertheless left Marseilles on the 27th of December, and after visiting Jibuti proceeded to the Persian Gulf. Lord Salisbury is unable to admit that in this instance or in any others permission was given by British officers for an illicit traffic in arms with Persian ports. That the Persian Government has long prohibited the trade, and that it has therefore been an illicit traffic pursued at the risk of the importer, is not open to doubt. It may equally be true that certain Persian officials have been induced by importers, or have consented from motives of self-interest, to evade the law and to connive at importation. But this evasion of the laws and regulations of Persia does not alter the fact that the trade has throughout been illicit; nor would it justify Her Majesty’s Government in placing any obstacles in the path of a stricter enforcement of the law of Persia, when once the Persian Government had decided upon such a step. The memorandum enclosed by you quotes a statement published by the “ Central News,” as to the source from whence the arms used by the tribes on the North-West frontier of India are derived, and on this and other arguments bases the inference that British interests are not injuriously affected by the illicit traffic to Persia. Lord Salisbury is unable to accept this conclusion, and I am to state that in more quarters than one and in regions less remote from the Persian Gulf than the North-West Frontier of India, arms imported into Persia and Muscat have found their way into the hands of those who have used them in a manner inimical to British interests. I am in conclusion to observe that it appears that a large portion of the arms and ammunition exported in this manner from Manchester, though shipped as being of British manufacture, is not really of British origin, but is made abroad; and that a representation from a leading manufacturer of ammunition in England protesting against this evasion of the Merchandise Marks Acts is now receiving the attention of Government.

Reports of the actual seizure of the “Baluchistan” sent by post by Commander of “Lapwing” to Admiralty direct, 26th January.41 No. 46. India Office to the Governor General of India in Council. Secret No. 6 of 1898. My Lord, India Office, 18th March 1898. I forward, for the information of your Excellency’s Government, a Political * From Foreign Office, dated 12th CC W °f certain correspondence which 1888/98. March 1898, and enclosures. (Enclosures in has passed between the Eoreign Office Foreign Office Letters of 5th and 7th March and Messrs. Eracis Times &amp; Co * 1898 also sent—see Nos. 40 and 41). 2 . I shall be glad to receive any observations which the Resident at Bushire, or the Political Agent at Muscat, may have to offer. It will be observed that the Marquess of Salisbury has expressed his inability to object to measures being adopted at Muscat for enforcing the prohibition laid by the Persian Government upon the traffic in arms to Persia. 3. I am forwarding a copy of this Despatch direct to the Resident in the Persian Gulf in order that he may lose no time in submitting his report, and that of the Political Agent at Muscat, to your Excellency in Council. 4. I am awaiting your Excellency’s report as to the arrangement made with the Chief of Bahrein, and the measures taken in consequence. With reference to the letter from this Office of the 7 th instant, I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to transmit to you, to be laid before Lord George Hamilton, a copy of a letter from Messrs. Eracis Times and Company, and of the reply w r hich has been returned thereto respecting the importation of arms into Persia and places on the Persian Gulf. I am to suggest that Messrs. Eracis Times and Company’s letter should be referred to Her Majesty’s Resident in the Persian Gulf for his observations, and to the Government of India for inquiry as to the arrangements which have been made at Bahrein. As you appear to be under complete misapprehension with reference to our position in respect of the property recently seized, we think it right to send you the enclosed explanatory statement, every word of which we are prepared to verify, and which must convince every impartial person that the seizure of our property by the British Government was without justification. The consequences of the course thus adopted, and delay in making restitution of our property, are most cruel, for although we have a large S. 8. L I have, &amp;c., George Hamilton.

We feel therefore that we are upon every ground entitled to ask for immediate attention to our case. We are, &amp;c.. Sir Thomas H. Sanderson, K.C.B. Fracis Times &amp; Co. Enclosure in above. 27, Leadenhall Street, London, E.C., 7 th March 1898. We the undersigned, Fracis, Times, &amp; Co., British subjects, have for upwards of 18 years carried on business as general merchants in the city of London, and have from time to time established branch houses and agencies at various places, including:— JBushire. —In the year 1887 we established an agency at Bushire, and in the year 1891 a member of our firm took up his residence there, and we then acquired business premises of our own. The business from that time has been under the direct management of a member of our firm. The premises consist of a building used as a store, with business offices and domestic rooms in the quarter of the town usually occupied by Europeans. From the time we commenced business at Bushire we have been in the habit of making shipments of rifles, pistols, and ammunition, as well as of various other articles, from London to Bushire, and selling the same by retail at our business premises there. All arms and ammunition thus shipped have been so described in the Custom House returns and ships’ manifests, and on arrival at Bushire have invariably been examined by the Persian authorities at the Custom House and Customs duties have been paid upon them. This course of business has been well known to the resident British Government representative at Bushire. Until our goods were recently seized we had no intimation that there was, or had been, any prohibition of the import into Bushire of arms or ammunition. No notice to that effect is to be found at the Custom House at Bushire, or to our knowledge elsewhere, and v r e had no reason whatever to suppose that any prohibition promulgated bv a former Shah of Persia was in force. In the annual official reports published by the Foreign Office and sub mitted to both Houses of Parliament, details are given of exports and imports from and into Bushire in the two previous years. From the annual report so presented to Parliament in the month of September 1896, it appears that in the year 1895 711 packages of arms and ammunition, of the value of 56,301/. sterling, were imported into Bushire, and that during the year 1891 479 packages of arms and ammunition, of the value of 37,678/., were imported into Bushire, and from the same return it appears that during the year 1895 57 cases of arms and ammunition and 4,000 rifles, of the value together of 25,444/. sterling, were exported from Bushire, and that during the year 1894 77 cases of arms and ammunition and 4,000 rifles, of the value together of 30,406/. sterling, were exported from Bushire. Notwithstanding the above state of things, in the month of December last a Persian official at Bushire and the British Consul there, acting on behalf of the British Government, entered our go-down and seized about 3,800 rifles and a quantity of ammunition, our property, which had in the w r ay described been imported into Bushire, and mostly for transhipment to the Oman coast, passed through the Custom House there after paying duty in the usual way. In like manner, arms and ammunition, our property, then in the Custom House at Bushire, were seized at the same time. Our property thus seized at Bushire was of the value of 30,000/. sterling. Island of Baharin .—In the year 1895 we established an agency at Baharin under charge of Mr. Mahomed Bahim Saffer. The island of Baharin is situate on the south side of the Persian Gulf off the Ooman coast, but doesnot, we believe, form part of the territorial dominions of the Shah of Persia. The island is governed by an independent Sheik. Before we commenced business in Baharin we obtained from the Sheik a firman granting us the sole right to import and deal in arms and ammunition in the said island. This firman is well known to the British Resident at Bushire, and is still in force. The course of business at Baharin is precisely similar to that at Bushire, and we have exported various articles, including arms and ammu nition, to Baharin, all which shipments have in ordinary course of business been examined at the Custom House at Baharin and Customs duties paid upon them and have been subsequently offered for sale to the public. It appears, however, that recently arms and ammunition belonging to us, of the value of upwards of 12 , 000 /. sterling, have been seized and confiscated by the British Consul at Baharin. And in Bushire Harbour arms and ammunition, our property, then on board the S.S. “ Tresco ” in transit to Baharin, were in like manner seized by order of Her Majesty’s Government. Muscat .—In the year 1896 we commenced to trade with the Port of Muscat, and appointed as our agent Damodhai Dharamsey, a British Indian subject resident at Muscat. Our trade to Muscat has been principally in arms and ammunition, and has been carried on under a special permit from the Sultan of Muscat. So far as we have been able to ascertain, there never has been any prohibition from the Sultan of Muscat with respect to the importation of arms and ammunition, and the trade in such articles to Muscat has never been in any way questioned. Muscat is an independent State in or near the entrance to the Persian Gulf. In 1839 a Treaty of Commerce Tvas entered into between Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Muscat, which treaty provided that no article whatever should be prohibited from being imported into or exported from the territories of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, that the trade between the dominions of Her Britannic Majesty and those of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat should be perfectly free subject to a duty of 5 per cent, upon goods imported. We have arms and ammunition at Muscat of the value of about 9,000/. sterling, and we have been informed that, on the 13th January 1898, the representative of the British Government at Muscat has prohibited the sale of arms and ammunition there. S.S. “ Baluchistan .'—In the month of December 1897 we, in the ordinary course of business, shipped in London 30 cases of ammunition by this vessel, consigned to our abovenamed agent at Muscat for transhipment to Baharin. When the “ Baluchistan ” was off the Port of Muscat she was seized by Her Majesty’s ship “ Lapwing,” and our property was taken out of the “ Baluchistan ” and confiscated. The property so seized was of the value of 700/. sterling. All the shipments of arms and ammunition made by us to the abovenamed places have been made in the ordinary course of business for the purpose of the retail trade, which has for many years been carried on with the full knowledge of, and without any objection on the part of, Her Majesty’s Government, and also with the full knowledge of, and without any objection from, the authorities at Bushire, Baharin, and Muscat, and certainly no such shipments were made with the view of supplying tribes engaged in hostilities with Her Majesty’s Government in the Empire of India or elsewhere. Indeed, no one acquainted with the locality, and with the distances and means of transport, would believe that any part of such shipments could have directly or indirectly found their way to the tribes .on the North-West Prontier of India. Sub-Enclosure 2. Foreign Office to Fracis Times &amp; Co. Foreign Office, Gentlemen, 12th March 1898. I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7 th instant, with respect to your position in44 connection with the measures which have recently been taken to prevent the importation of arms and ammunition into Persia and places on the Persian Gulf. I am to inform you in reply that a copy of the statement enclosed by you will be forwarded to Her Majesty’s Resident at Bushire, and to Her Majesty’s Charge d Affaires at Teheran for their observations. It impossible for lord Salisbury to admit that the traffic in arms to Persia was^ not prohibited since, early in 1896, his attention was drawn to a case in which arms belonging to a British firm were detained by the Persian authorities at Bushire because they had been landed at that port in spite of the prohibition of the Persian Government. It is also impossible that Her Majesty’s Government should object to measures being adopted by the Sultan of Muscat, at the request of the Persian Government, for enforcing that prohibition. I am, &amp;c., Messrs. Pracis Times and Company. Political 1854/98. No. 47. Enclosure in Foreign Office Letter of 18th March 1898. Foreign Office to Mr. Hardinge, Teheran, dated ISth March 1898. (Telegraphic.) No. 23. Messrs. Fracis Times &amp; Co., one of the firms whose rifles have been seized, have addressed to us letter of protest in which, among other arguments, they state that they established agency at Bushire in 1887, and that since that time they have constantly shipped to that port arms and ammunition which have been so described in Custom House returns and ships’ manifests, have been examined by Persian Customs authorities, and paid Customs duties. 1 hey state further that all this was well known to British Consul-General, and that they never had any intimation that there was, or had been, any prohibition of the import of arms and ammunition into Bushire, that no notice to that effect is to be found at Custom House or elsewhere, nor had they any reason to suppose that prohibition promulgated by former Shah was in force. Please obtain and telegraph observations of Her Majesty’s Consul-General on these statements. We have already replied that, as to our knowledge a consignment of arms was seized at Bushire two years ago, we cannot admit that the prohibition was unknown, but it would be useful to be able to traverse their statements more completely. Letter will be sent to you and to India for detailed reply. Political 384/98. No. 48. From Viceroy to Secretary of State, 21 st March 1898. (Telegraphic.) Your secret telegram* of 21 st February. Political Agent at Muscat * No 33 reports that Sultan now refuses to hold Court of Judicature without prior assurance that, if Court finds that arms ex “ Baluchistan ” were lawfully seized, the whole will be at Sultan’s absolute disposal. Meade reports Sultan’s attitude recently very unsatisfactory. I am directing* Meade to proceed to Muscat and explain to Sultan that, pending elucidation of all facts, no assurance can be given, but any representation Sultan has to make will receive full consideration. Political Agent says that Sultan’s attitude is undoubtedly caused by French intrigues. He told Sultan he would suspend payment of subsidy pending orders of Government. I shall await result of Meade’s visit.I 45 Zb No. 49. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 22nd March 1898. (Telegraphic.) Your telegram of 21 st * No. 22. March. See my telegram* of 1st February Political explaining procedure. I presume that 384 /98. in case of “ Baluchistan ” arms were seized by British ship without the presence of any Muscat official empowered to inquire and seize in Sultan’s name, and that it is this preliminary inquiry which Sultan now refuses to make after our ships have co-operated with him in stopping “ Baluchistan ” on the assumption that inquiry would follow. If that is the case, Sultan should he courteously pressed to appoint an officer to hold inquiry. Our Consul should regulate his action according to my telegram above cited. I am awaiting the proceedings of the Muscat official, and any subsequent proceedings in the Consulate, as several complaints and applications have been received, and law-suits are possible. Full details of seizure of each case are therefore required here for reference. Regarding ultimate disposal of confiscated arms, see Secretary’s Letter,! No. 6 , of 11th Februarv. As it is desirable to * conciliate Sultan, it seems impolitic to threaten suspension of subsidy. f Forwarding letter to No. 19. Foreign Office, # Not printed. No. 50. Enclosure in Foreign Office Letter of 23rd March. Foreign Office to Fracis Times &amp; Co. Foreign Office, Gentlemen, 23rd March 1898. I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to acknowledge the Political receipt of your letter of the 15th 1861/98. instant,* in which you protest against the delay involved by a reference to Teheran and Bushire of your previous statement respecting your claim to recover possession of certain arms and ammunition which have recently been seized. It appears from this letter that the object of the reference of your statement to Persia has been misunderstood. According to the information in the possession of Her Majesty’s Government the importation of arms into Persia bas been prohibited, at least since 1881, by Persian regulations. It is notorious and has been stated in official reports that the traffic in arms which has nevertheless taken place was in violation of the regulation. It was therefore carried on subject to the risk which must necessarily attend such transactions. The Persian Government have lately taken effective steps to enforce the prohibition. In these steps which they were perfectly justified in taking, they have requested the assistance of friendly Powers. Her Majesty’s Government have thought it right to give that assistance, and they are not prepared to interfere with the action taken unless they are satisfied that the trade in any particular instance being carried on by British subjects was not illicit. The inquiries made by the Marquess of Salisbury have not hitherto resulted in procuring such evidence, and it is observed that the consignees of the arms and ammunition shipped by you have not come forward with their bills of lading and other proofs to satisfy the Consular Authorities in the Persian Gulf as to the open and lawful character of their transactions. His Lordship has informed you in my letter of the 12 th instant of his inability to object to the measures taken. But he has forwarded your statement to the Resident at Bushire in order that it may be taken into consideration with the representations which may have been made by your S. 8. m</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000db_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C87/1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000db</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C87/1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Selection from Correspondence Relative to the Traffic in Arms in the Persian Gulf, 1897-98.
