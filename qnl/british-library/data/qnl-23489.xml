D/0. No.3648. Bahrain. 27th February 1944. Dear You may remember that hitherto our personnel in Qatar were permitted to draw on Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. for their liquor supplies. As jfheir requirements were exported from Bahrain, under the usual Customs Shipping Bill, and consumed in Qatar, the (Question of permits from the Political Agent did not arise In the event of our reopening the Qatar camp it is very desirable that we should know beforehand whether: (a) Qatar Staff can draw on Gray, Mackenzie, Bahrain. (b) Will the 'permit' and rationing system.apply. Yours sincerely. Major T.Hickinbotham, C.I.E., O.B.E. The Agency, Bahrain. f- (*■) fU*. A^5 P.C .L., Bahrain. PR.11/2838 My dear Colonel, ISth January, 1946. Bahrain S...3J1 Mr. Glynn-Jones and Mr. Ramsden, the two geologists, will be working in the hinterland of the Trucial coast based on Dubai for some five or six months. They have already assembled at Dubai. Mr. Glynn-Jones has asked if they can be issued with a permit to purchase and export to Dubai alcoholic liquor from Gray Mackenzie, Bahrain, stocks. You will remember that our Qatar British and local staff were allowed to obtain liquor from Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Bahrain, who arranged the export. Alternatively perhaps Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. could be authorised to expert to Dubai in the name of our geologists. The point which seems to arise is whether or not Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. stocks can be held to be designed to meet the requirements of British personnel working on the Trucial Coast. We should be grateful for any arrangements that you are able to make to help Mr. Glynn-Jones and his assistant in this matter. fz Yours sincerely, Lt.-Col. A.C.Galloway, O.B.E., H.B.M 1 s Political Agent, Bahrain. 27th January. Since commencing this letter we have had a letter from Lermitte (copy attached) which indicates that our geologists would like to be in a position to entertain the R•A.F• and B.0.A.U.officers in return for hospitality and assistance received. End. I(r^ kq) COPY Dubai, 21st January 1946 My dear Packer, Glynn-Jones has asked me to write to you and to ask you to try and get the P. A. to allow him 6 bottles of whisky a month. Neither he nor Ramsden drink much and they would like to have some to give to the Officers Mess or anybody else who helps then. They have had excellent help re D.I.D. stores, NAAFI privileges, maintenance of vehicles, the off loading of their vehicles from the steamer and a certain amount of help from B.O.A.C. The R.A.F. have offered to keep a radio watch when their set arrives etc etc. Would you please try and get them some thing, there is none obtainable from NAAFI or officers mess. Yours sincerely, ISgd.) B.H.Lermitte cpd/ACMh I ft 1 II ' D. 0»Ko.398-a/2« My dear Packer, The 6th February,1946. f2&gt; I enclose a permit for two cases of whisky for Glynn-Jones and Ramsden.

I*did not reply to your d.o Tito.398-8/2 dated the 6th February 1946 before as I-was hoping to hear what arrangements, if any, were being made by the Company for &lt; v atar and tne Trucial Coast parties. As far as I can gather, the situation at present is as follows (a) Q.atar We have been given to understand that-certain consignments of beer and whisky are being arranged for a small party concerned with the rehabilitation of the ^atar camp. We have, however, no news of any shipments. As you probably know, ^atar drew on Bahrain stocks up to 1942 \^ien the camp closed down including some of the Indian clerks. Until our own stocks materialise we should very much appreciate your assurance that our Qatar staff will be allowed to draw on Bahrain. In this connection, we would refer you to para 2 of our no .PR.11/2846 dated the 22nd January 1946 (copy attached fOT ready referencey which describes the previous procedure in respect of Indians. ^ rr a v (b) Trucial Coast Commencing October 1946 and continuing probably for several years there will be considerable activity in the Trued.al Coast based mainly on Dubai and Sharjah. As many as 20 Americans ar^d British employees will be involved. So far we cannot rely on the Company being able to arrange for its own imports of liquor on the Trucial Coast. In these circumstances, we should like to be in a position to draw on Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Bahrain, for quarterly allotments. ' We shall be grateful for any assistance you can render us in this matter. t Yours sincerely, Lt. -Col.A.C.Galloway, O.B.E., ^.B .M 's Political Agent, Bahrain. End.7 Dear Sir, ISSUE OF LIO.UOH PERMITS TO . ,. \ H &gt; « P.C.L.i:roiA NS &amp;, ANGLO-INDIANS g T' ..\ - Will you please refer to your No,197-8/2.A dated the 16th January, 1946. 1. P.C.L., Bahrain . It is difficult for us to estimate the number even if it can be taken that all personnel whose religion does not debar or who are known to be not teetotallers are assessed, as we cannot make forecasts in respect of new arrivals. It would seem, however, as far as we can anticipate the Company's activities, that IE permits would be sufficient for P.C.L., Bahrain, provided of course that artizan types and domestics are not to be allowed to purchase. In our view, permits should be strictly con fined to persons accustomed to the use of alcohol and newcomers should not be encouraged to commence ^ the habit even if their religion permits. This, of course, would entail the careful consideration by the employers of each case individually. We would submit in conclusion that the issue of a reasonable number of permits will hardly be regarded as an equitable solution by those who arrive after the quota has been reached. Actually there seems no satisfactory solution- 2 - PR.11/2846 (contd. (id) except the issue of permits to all clerical types accustomed to drinks. The objection to this of course will probably be the limitations of stocks available. 2. P.D.Q. t Qatar. Up to the closing down of Dukhan camp our Indian clerical employees drew on Gray Mackenzie with the knowledge and the approval of the Political Agent but Agency permits were not issued. The Engineer-in-Charge passed the applications and the amount was based on 10% of salary. We suggest, however, that consideration of the Qatar problem, both Europeans and Indians, should be left until the camp reopens, probably in early March.

If Gray toackenzies were unwilling or unable to obtain supplies, perhaps such a firm as Fhipsons of Karachi would te glad to do so and to extend their business to the TrUcial coast. At present, personnel of the Oil Company here ere able to obtain hardly any liquor at ell. I estimate that, apart 1 rom the R.A.F. who have their own supplies, there ere 20 Europeans and iJLericans at present living on the Trucial coatt for whom a quota of whisky anc ^in - and if possible ot beer ~ is desirable. Kor the present 1 suggest that 10 cases a quarter of each would suffice. This would enable each man to buy 2 bottles of whisky and 2 of gin a month, and some beer. /H Political Officer, Tircial coast, aharjah.No. 377-8/2C POLITICAL AGFKCY, BAHRAIN. Thp 2nd February, 194?.

MQmor andum; - I am sending with this letter a bottle of alcohol made in Goa. Large quantities of this liquor are now being smuggled into Bahrain from .Qatar where it is on sale in the bazaar. I have good reason to believe that a consignment of this liquor has been imported into Qatar in cases ' marked Saleh bin Mana. It is sold^in Qatar at fifl* 3/- a bottle and the black market price in Bahrain is about Rs.15/- to its. 20/-. At the moment there are two Indian dhows in Manama harbour carrying consignments of the same liquor. The police are keeping a watch on the boats to prevent bottles being smuggled ashore.

I must, therefore, make it clear to you that P.C.L. should not rely upon anything from the Bahrain quota for their staff in Qatar for the coming quarter. Yours sincerely. Id. C.J.Felly.

L? The Political BAHREIN. Dear Sir, Bahrein, 28th April, 19 4-7« Quota of Whisky &amp; Gin for Trucial Coast and Qatar. r With reference to previous correspondence on the above subject we have to advise having now heard from our London friends who write as under; 'You will have received our letter of 20th January informing you of the reduction of allocations of Johnnie Walker Whisky and in view of this it is useless asking them to make even nominal shipments to new markets. Gin is in short supply and we have obtained quantities from various distillers for shipment to your port under advice to you, as aupplies are available. Besides the 50 cases Seagers and 25 cases Gordon's gin shipped to you in March, we have an order for a further 60 cases Coates Gin. In view of the foregoing, if yuu consider it advantageous that token shipments diould be made to Sharjah and Dubai, we suggest that these could be taken from the Whisky and Gin shipments we make to you, and if you will advise us we will arrange for same to be specially marked for re-export.' Besides the above quota of Gin for Bahrein, we have received further advice that Gray Dawes have been able to sacure further supplies as under; 50 cases Gin - for shipment during April/june. 100 ' ' for shipment during 2nd half of year. Yours faithfully, GT.AY,(a) Translation of letter dated the 23rd Jarnadah Ath-Ihani, 136(3 (13.5,47) from H.E. the Ruler of Qatar to the Political Agent Bahrain. After Compliments, i /I I \j I felt surprised when I read Your Excellency^ esteemed letter No.69 dated the 7th May, 1947 (17th Jamadah Ath-Thani, 1366) and found strange what Your Excellency mentioned that a quantity of liquor of Goanese origin has arrived at Qatar from India, So far as I know uoa is situated in the Province of Baluchistan and I am quite certain that what Your Excellency heard in this respect is far from being true. In proof of this we have no direct contact with Goa or India; nor has any of our countrycraft recently arrived from India or Baluchistan. You will therefore realise that the information received by Your Excellency is a false one, having no shade of truth. Your Excellency may also note that if the quantity referred * to by you is an intoxicant iiRk drink, this would concern us much, as it is repugnant and condemned to us and our religious laws vehemently prohibits it, so that no one is allowed to import such things. The punishment for any one infringing is severe. For these reasons, no one can dare undertake this and it is not within the probability that it can spread in our country. Your informant may either be a self-interested person or an impulsive calumniator - in any case abominable and base. ynt.^ ,ie thank Your Excellency and highly value^action if you would co-operate in the matter by instituting investigations with the informant as to the source from which he collected this information and the countrycraft which loaded this quantity and as to what proof he has in support of his allegation. The informant should be able to prove, in a reasonable way, what he reported; or Your Excellency should take the necessary action against such persons who cause tumult and whose aim is to fish in troubled waters. I am awaiting further action from Your Excellency and will^see the result.*ACS/1136. Bahrain, 4th November, 47* The Manager, The Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., Q A T A K. ^ear bir.
