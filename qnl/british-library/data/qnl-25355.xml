Four Carpet firms have lodged claims for an aggregate of Krans 50,664 on account of losses accruing from recent interruption of work for eight days due to misconduct of people and Governor-General. I have not investigated justice of amounts claimed, but they are probably tolerably fair and I would recommend Persian Government be urged to extract the above mentioned or some substan tial sum from Amir either from his next month’s pay or from 10,000 Tomans if and when that is paid to him in near future. Persian Government appears for once to have the means of recovering com pensation and should, in my opinion, make use of them. y-'q 1 M'' 6 Enclosure No. 2.

Amir privately informed Vice-Consul this evening that he had resigned. Public does not yet know of his dismissal. Amir demanded of me: Firstly— That' arrangements should be made for all monies due to him being paid here. i \i India, Foreign Secretary’s No 47 M, dated 20 , 0 V 1813Secondly —• That person to take over temporary charge of province be nominated. The first demand is reasonable except as regards ten thousand tomans and unless complied with Bakhtiaris may be expected to plunder districts if not town itself; please alter my telegram* No. 140 * Enclosure No. i ante. accordingly. Second point is very neces- sarv unless Amir is forced to stay till Sardar Muhtasham’s arrival, which is probably impossible. As I have already remarked any interregnum will mean general insecurity. Failing Amir Hishmat, who will presumably resign, bardar Nusrat seems to be the only possible ad interim Governor. Amir has just sent me telegram received from his Deputy and nephew at Rapsinjan stating Lecoffre has telegraphed to Commandant of Gendarmerie to bring him with him by force to Kerman.

Glimstedt is ill with some sort high feven He is with me and receiving medical attendance.[Tais Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Govern™^*-] PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [November 17.] Section 5. [52064] No. 1. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 17.) (No. 232.) Sir, Tehran, October 29, 1913. IN my despatch No. 213 of the 1st instant I reported that the Bakhtiari khans had demanded that Sardar Mohtashem should he appointed Governor-General of Kerman in the place of his brother Amir-i-Mufakham, and that I considered that the appointment of Samsam-es-Sultaneh at Ispahan was worth the bargain, although the Amir had done by no means badly at Kerman. Almost immediately^after the despatch of that statement an incident occurred at Kerman, during which Amir-i-Mufakham is reported to have acted extremely badly, and to have done his utmost to thwart the work of Mr. Lecoffre, the financial agent. The incident arose out of the imposition of a tax upon all laden animals entering the town of Kerman. This tax is levied here as well as at Meshed, Kum, and other Persian towns, and was originally imposed by a law of the Medjliss. The people of Kerman rebelled against the levying of the tax, and somewhat serious disorders occurred, which led to the closing of the bazaars and a general stoppage of work in all the carpet looms, thus inflicting considerable loss on British trade interests. It would appear quite clear from the telegraphic reports that reached me from His Majesty’s consul that the Governor-General was much to blame for not taking the necessary energetic measures to put a stop to the disturbances. There is, indeed, some reason to believe that his attitude may have fanned the flame r which he hoped would consume Mr. Lecoffre, with whom he had quarrelled upon a matter of finance. His Majesty’s consul at Kerman has reported, as I had the honour to inform you in my telegram No. 366 of the 21st instant, that certain British carpet firms have made a claim amounting to about 1,000k on account of damage done to their Business by the closing of the bazaars and the stoppage of work. He has expressed an opinion that this money should be recovered from Amir-i-Mnfakham. I do not share this view, as there is no actual proof of the Governor-General’s guilt, and it seems to me that a bad precedent would be thereby established in a country like Persia, where the bazaars in the various centres are constantly being closed as a means of exerting pressure. I know of no previous occasion upon which a claim has been preferred on similar grounds. The Government at Tehran decided that it would be advisable to postpone the collection of the tax for the present, and sent orders in this sense to Kerman. Had j the matter stopped there it would have been such a blow to the prestige of Mr. Lecoffre that he could not have remained in Kerman, and the future of the financial adminis tration would have been gravel} 7 jeopardised. Since Captain Lorimer attached all the blame for what had occurred to the bad behaviour of Amir-i-Mufakham, I sent his Excellency a strongly-worded message through him, in which I expressed my great displeasure to hear of his bad behaviour. The Minister of the Interior sent at the same time a similar telegram, with the result that the Amir decided to resign rather than to await his dismissal. His resignation was at once accepted, and Sardar Mohtashem appointed in his place. It seemed to me politic to support the cadidature of Sardar Mohtashem under existing circumstances rather than to press for the appointment of someone who was not a Bakhtiari. Circumstances have obliged this legation to deal somewhat hardly with the khans of late, and as it appears to me essential that we should continue to enjoy their good-will, there seemed to be nothing for it but to express a hope that the Sardar would be chosen. I have seen a good deal of Sardar Mohtashem since I have been in Tehran, both when his Excellency was Minister of War and after he Jeft office at the beginning of the year, when Samsam-es-Sultaneh resigned in favour of Afa-es-Sultaneh, the present Prime Minister. I have always found Sardar Mohtashem most friendly-disposed to our interests, and it was plain from his facial expression that he made a big effort to swallow the pill I held out to the khans on the evening when they agreed to accept terms that enabled a settlement of the quarrel with the [1933 r—5] (28 NOVI 913^; Copy to tnd?a 2 8 NOV 19131 gendarmerie to be reached. Sardar Mohtashem has given me the most solemn assurances that he will act at Kerman in the true interests of the people of the nrowhce He has also declared his fixed determination not to take a farthing of money beyond what is his just due. It is of course hopeless to expect that a Bakhtiari or for the matter of that, any other Persian Governor-General, will not seek for nickings and it is only to be hoped that Sardar Mohtashem wiU sometimes retmLr hi pramises. In addition to the desirability of concihating the Bakhtiaris I can see no one who could have been relied upon to make a better Governor-General than Sardar Mohtashem, and in appointing a Bakhtiari one knows that the new Governor will have his ready-made force of some 300 men to assist him in keeping order. 'I have told Sardar Mohtashem that 300 men seem to me quite sufficient for his purpose now that there are gendarmes at Kerman. It does not appear to me desirable that the Bakhtiari sowars should be more numerous^ than the gendarmes, whom the Sardar has promised to assist in their work of recruiting and organising a large number of men. ^ have &amp;c -r-r-r a f m 1 T\ m /~\ TTT \TT TTVTTCONFIDENTIAL, No. 3142, dated Bushire, the 18th (received 27th) October 1913.

Also some indication what my official relation to them should be ; what control or authority if any I should seek to acquire • and what w : ork British Government expects them to do. Lecoffre is looking forward to having them completely under his control for such purposes as he judges good and Governor-General yesterday asked me whether they were to be under his orders or Lecoffre’s. Only information I have about functions, etc., of gendarmerie is what has appeared in public press; there is nothing in my office records. telegram R. No. 85, dated (and received) 15th October 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, (repeated Resident, Bushire, No. 361). Your telegram No. 133. there are no regulations governing the functions and subordination of gendarmerie. Theoretically as they are under immediate jurisdiction of Minister of the Interior here, so in provinces they are under orders of Governor-GeneraL Practically it is most desirable that all action should be taken in consultation with Governor-General who should, as far as may be possible, be made to believe his views are being acted on, though one cannot but recognize that Officer Com manding must frequently rely on his own judgment. Glimsted is perhaps somewhat over-prone to do this. You should seek to acquire full (as possible ?) control over gendarmerie in a friendly manner. I am sure that they will always turn to you for assistance and advice as the Colonel does to me here, and you should serve as a channel for smoothing difficulties that may arise between them and Governor-General. Their first duty is to secure order on trade routes as soon as they feel them selves strong enough to do so. Glimsted will doubtless render Lecoffre such assistance as he can, but force is not a treasury force as Shuster’s was and is in no sense under his orders or control. Garnett will explain fully.

Finance Agent has announced tax on vehicles, horses et cetera in accord ance with Majlis Act. British subjects, except those connected with Consulate, are required to pay. Should I instruct them to do so? If so, I would suggest notifying that payment will be made only so long as local finances are in charge of Official acceptable to us and on condition that Consulate should be consulted as to expenditure of money collected and have the right to inspect accounts of the same. If you object absolutely to payment can you please arrange matter in Tehran. I have seen just now your Vice-Consular letter of May 29th, 1912, to Imperial Bank of Persia, Tehran. I think no one here will object to payment on terms I have proposed and it will make my support of Governor-General and Finance Agent against threatened popular resistance more effective.

In my opinion the Persian Government should issue cteq/nre. order at once one way or other and insist on it being immediately carried into effect; otherwise there will be serious trouble. If confirmed after delay Gendarmes will be saddled with introducing the collection of tax on their arrival and will incur unpopularity.

State of town is worse to-day as I anticipated from Amir’s attitude yesterday. _ If Amir does no at once suppress agitation by force, if necessary, which he has in abundance, either he or Finance Department must go- There has been no violence to Europeans yet but it is threatened and sup plies to Consulate were yesterday stopped on the way. If the Amir would seize or threaten ring-leaders it might suffice. I was told that they are following but I have no certainty :—Agha Yahya, Jamal-ud-Din, Nasrat-i-Mumalik and his son and Mirza Ali Muhammad. Persian Government might, I think, be informed that claims will be lodged for daily loss to carpet companies which they should recover from Amir whose pay could be stopped. Amir in any case should not be dismissed till (he has ?) restored order, Gendarmes arrive, and new Governor-General arranged for, otherwise matters may become worse. Following report just received : Amir’s notices have been torn down, and police complain to Eastern Rug Company that Amir forbade them to interfere, also that they proposed to arrest Haji Saiyid Ali Baghkhani and Haji Qasim Zaim who, they say, are the principal ring-leaders and take security from them but that Amir prohibited this also.

Following may be of interest to you. I think Amir’s attitude, which has gone beyond his original intention, is due to my hints of two or three months ago not to oppress excessively, to the coming of the Gendarmerie, and to his failure to extract from Lecoffre payment of unwarrantable expedition claims and of 10,000 tomans mentioned in my tele gram 124. He has collected much money but, I believe, is bled by Samsam who keeps a spy here to watch his takings. I have hitherto supported Amir through good and evil report in view of supreme public benefit of security. This once gone there is no further reason for supporting him. When news of town disturbances reaches districts distur bances will probably start there also. Telegram R., No. 183/dated (and received) 10th October 1913.

Orders from Cabinet in Tehran are expected to day but in no circumstances now do I look for any useful action from Amir as he is irretrievably committed and this is universally know. Persian Government will probably have to make some sort of concession to popular feeling and only thing I can think of, short of complete surrender, is removal from Kerman of Mirza Ibrahim Khan and his relations. Consulate is rightly recognized as having consistently supported Finance Department and so shares its unpopularity. Further being unable to suggest withdrawal of the taxes and complete nullification of Finance Department entailed thereby I cannot attempt the role of peace-maker.I am now (perfectly ?) well assured of truth of report that Amir a fortnight ago had the people of Bam advised not to pay revenue to Finance Agent there. Telegram No. 13*&gt; dated the 13'h October 1913* From-—His Majesty's Consul, Kerman, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Following answer given on persistent demand of representatives agitators, Begins. With regard to statement which has been presented and verbal explanations accompanying it I understand that what is demanded by agitators is that Nawagil should be postponed and that no more taxes should be paid until full examination of accounts and methods of collecting opium tax shall have been made by representatives of people. It is said that immense sums of money have been embezzled by subordinate Maliyeh officers and that latter have entered into houses of people by force and committed acts of violence in them. Also it is alleged that no official in Persia can lawfully enter any one’s house without permission of owner. It is demanded that a local Majlis comprising of representatives of Government Maliyeh public and British Consulate should be formed to investigate these complaints and it is declared that until this is done people will continue present agitation and refuse pay all taxes. I am asked to support people in this and immediate reply is demanded from me. It is as follows :— Firstly .—This is matter between Persian Kermanis and their own Govern ment. Secondly .—Nawagil is in accordance with law passed former Majlis and is now in force in other towns in Persia ; l see no reason why exception may be made in favour of Kerman. Thirdly .—As regards complaints regarding embezzlement of revenues and actions of finance subordinates, these have to be proved, and in any case even if true in no country would that count as reasons for suspending collection of taxes. Fourthly .—When people have declared that they will not obey law their Government cannot be expected to listen to their complaints. Fifthly—\ am prepared to communicate people’s demands to^ Minister, but while people remain in commotion and rebellion I do not believe Minister will be able to take their part. Sixthly .— My advice to people is that they should return to their work and pay taxes lawfully demanded of them, then perhaps it may be possible to have subjects of complaints investigated by properly appointed body represent ing both people and Government. Repeated Bushire. Telegram R., No. 83, dated (and received) 13th October 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. (Repeated Resident, Bushire, No. 360.) I approve of answer made to people of Kerman as reported in your telegram No. 131, but it appears to me you should insist on Governor-General taking immediately necessary action to put a stop to disorders. I have telegraphed His Excellency personally, but you should tell him that his conduct on this occa sion has been so unsatisfactory that I am greatly displeased. I understand Government is about to issue orders for discontinuation of tax for the present. Confidential .—has been practically decided to dismiss Amir and replace him by Sardar Mutasham. This would have had to be done in any case tosecure appointment of Samsam to Ispahan, but Amir has played most season ably into our hands. Telegram R., No. 132, dated 13th (received 14th) October 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Resident, Bushire, No. 187.) My telegram No. 131. To-day bazaar and carpet factories have re opened. This is only in accordance with originally declared programme and strikers could not have held out longer. Amir yesterday evening issued notice that Persian Government showing kindness to people had cancelled annual tax and that people must now resume work. It is stated, however, that Persian Government really telegraphed only that tax was suspended for time being and Lecoffre says he must start collecting it shortly. It is considered by people that Amir has scored. Yesterday Amir visited me and only half-heartedly denied part he had played. He also read ire a telegram which he said he had received from British Legation. I continue of opinion that it is necessary Amir should go out but not till tax question has been settled and if necessary collection enforced by himself and till gendarmes are settled in. Relations between Amir aud Lecoffre will be now quite impossible. Latter of course has faulty manner and personality, but Finance Department may shut up if he is not supported. Later on his faults may be criticised and as far as possible corrected. Telegram R., No. 136, dated 16th (received 17th) October 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Resident, Bushire, No. 193.) My telegram No. 132. Amir continues to demand that his and Lecoffre’s spheres of authority be defined. He accuses Lecoffre of not answering his letters nor listening to complaints and of encouraging his agents to executive powers in districts but has given me no concrete facts. His importunity is largely in order to distract attention from his own misdemeanours in town and also probably districts. The two men hate each other beyond hope of any modus vivendi; secondly, Amir demands pecuniary payments not precisely specified while Lecoffre has referred him to Treasurer-General which I considered justified in circumstances. Amir is said to have incited people not to pay opium tax and to have forbidden police to assist Finance Department. Amir has been con stantly demanding satisfaction from me and now says he will resign if his demands are not complied with. Possibly he will do so. I see no reason to listen to him except to keep him quiet till he goes and prevent him from anticipating his dismissal. I am seeing Lecoffre again to-day out fear we are in an impasse. May I try to keep Amir quiet by saying you will deal with his demands in Tehran ? In any case please give me any sort of immediate answer to keep pot boiling. Telegram R., No. 137, dated 16th (received 17th) October 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Resident, Bushire, No, 194.) My telegram No. 131.

Thirdly.—\s there any prospect of the public enquiry suggested in para graph 6 of my answer to people? Is Legation in favour of and pressing for it ? These questions if inconvenient appear to me reasonable and an early answer to them on authority of the Persian Government except in regard to last point is desirable. If you concur can you give me an immediate answer to the effect that you are taking steps to obtain (concessions?) desired. I shall have to give some answer soon, otherwise I shall have people against me as everyone is at least interested. Telegram R., No. 139, dated 17th (received 18th) October 1913.

He made out very (good ?) case for himself on all counts and his attitude seems to me now as in past perfectly reasonable. He has not sought to interfere with Amir’s perquisites except where they directly prejudiced revenue. He had secured sanction of budget for his servants now of course hung up and was ready to help him in Tehran in regard to 10,000 Tumans. He thinks Amir has been hard pressed by blood-suckers in Tehran including Minister of the Interior. Telegram R., No. 86, dated (and received) the 18th October 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. (Repeated Resident, Bushire, No. 363.) Your telegram No. 136. If the Amir applies to you again you should inform him that I am thoroughly displeased with him; that I am much disappointed with him on account of his attitude during present crisis and that his only chance of recovering a measure of my good will is by now setting seriously to work to restore and maintain order until such time as the Government shall have decided upon measures to be taken.

If the people come to you for an answer you should say matter is in hand of Government and that you have no answer to give them. You might add circum stances of recent disorders will be enquired into in due course and that they must be quiet and orderly.

I am personally luite confident that there is no reason for any such apprehension but you should take an opportunity to speak to the Governor General and tell him that His Majesty's Government are greatly interested in the success of the Gendarmes' mission and that I know tliat I can con fidently rely upon His Excellency to accord them all the aid he possibly can in the execution of their duties which Include the enrolling of a larger force than their present one. . It would be-well if you sent a reassuring message to the Vice-Consul at Yazd for communication to the Commanding Officer because some unpleasantness may occur if the Gendarmes arrive as if they were entering a hostile country.

This was most I could expect, so I accepted, but with demur and not cordially. I think he will be more prudent future. in 1 also protested at non delivery of my despatches to him as alleged, and to Sardar Nasrat going surety for 10,000 Tomans for Sirjan rebel Husem Khan and Amir permitting the same and subsequent escape of the rebel possibly an arranged affair. 1 shall communicate on the subject of nominees for Deputy Governor shortly.

Your telegram 59. No such reports have been made to me. Town people and others are, as far as l can judge, very well contented with the Governor*General. I have not the slightest doubt that this is entirely the work of Ibrahim Khan and possibly half a dozen Sirjan rebels whom Governor-General has been dealing with. My reports from Sirjan indicate that population is content. Governor- General is doubtless no saint and the Finance Department may have some just grounds for complaint in regard to revenue. I am not in a position to pronounce fudgment. On the other hand, I have heard many rumours of Ibrahim Khan’s dishonesty and his hostility to Governor-General is notorious and as Lecoffre is under his influence I consider his removal highly desirable. Ibrahim Khan is himself very unpopular and Finance Department in a less degree. What right too has Ibrahim Khan to make complaints direct to Legation behind the backs of Lecoffre and myself ; and why was this telegram not submit ted through me as is I believe customary. As not a single person has approached me on the subject I should like to know names of the signatories. Enclosure 5. Telegram R., No. 92, dated 9th (leceived 10th) July 1913.

Difficulty was being experienced in finding a suitable nominee for -Deputy Governor when the Vice-Consul suggested Amir Hishmat at present Governor of Bam.C42FD—44—28-7-13—GCBP Simla- Idea seems to me excellent and Governor-General warmly approves. Hishmat personally impressed me favourably and seems to have done we a Bam and Lecoffre, whom I have not consulted in the present connection, has praised him to me.

There is little doubt that Governor-General has lined his pockets at expense of Rashid Sultan and 4 or 5 other Sirjan recalcitrants. He is said to have sent the spoils to Anar. Whether this has been done to the prejudice of revenue collection I cannot say certainly. I hear of no harsh treatment of ordinary population and I regard Governor-General as a probable offender against the Government and the Finance Department, but not the population of the province. I should be obliged if you could send me 5 or 6 names of the signatories as I lack a starting point for enquiries regarding the petition. Ibrahim Khan I believe is leaving Sirjan ostensibly for revenue purposes, but probably also to get Hussein Khan affair into his hands, vide my telegram No. 90. Latter is said to be merely revenue defaulter and, I am informed, wants to take bast in this Consulate and arrange settlement, but I have not as yet been approached on the subject. Enclosure 7.

Hearing that the Governor-General was mooting a Baluchi expedition, I considered it advisable to forestall him by telling him that my views (were) to the effect that it is no use invading Baluchistan until Persian Government is ready and able to provide for occupation and localization of administration on a permanent footing. At present all that should be done is to provide protection for Kerman by stationing cavalry forces at Rigan and Bam and possibly Zangi- ahmad for which 4 or 5 hundred men might suffice. Governor-General outwardly concurred. Lecoffre came to me to-day with a proposal to allow Governor-elect of Bam too horse and 100 camel men at a monthly cost of 1,600-1,800 Tomans for which sanction of Mornard is necessary. Pending ampler arrangements I con cur as in this case something is better than nothing. Subjugation of Baluchistan will require large and expensive expedition and should only be entered upon under European, preferably British, control and with a view to a permanent settlement, meanwhile protection of Kerman province and trade routes is necessary. Lately there have been more raids into Narmashir, and Bam is being constantly threatened.— CONFIDENTIAL. No. 2366, dated Bushire, the 26th July (received 4th August) 1913.

Officers have been asked for from Sweden and upon their arrival number of officers to be stationed at Kerman will be increased to five I am informed by Sir E. Grey that in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government abandon, for the present at all events, their intention to send British Officers to Kerman, but I have been instructed to tell the Persian Government that they may eventually find themselves obliged to take this step should the gendarmerie scheme about to be inaugurated in the province not be carried out in its entirety. It is possible that gendarmerie may meet with some opposition from the Governor-General as the Bakhtiaris are generally hostile to Swedes. You should therefore, watch His Excellency’s attitude closely and render gendarmes all the assistance you can. I await execution of their mission in success of which His Majesty’s Government are much interested. Enclosure No. 2. Telegram R., No. 101, dated (and received) 24th July 1913.

I hear stories of 2 or 3 large violent exactions made by Governor-General in last few days. This looks as if he contemplated presently levanting. As one of the alleged sufferers is Persian Agent in Sirjan of the Kerman Hindus, I think that I have the right to demand explanations from Governor-General and menace him if necessary. Do you agree ? Is there anything in the Tehran situation at present to strengthen or weaken Governor-General’s position and so account for this special audacity on his part, if it is substantiated. Enclosure No. 3.

In continuation of my telegram No. 70-93, dated 17th June 1913, I have the honour to forward attached a copy of the draft scheme which Mr. Lecoffre has handed me. 2. It is not very easy to furnish an intelligent criticism of it, as, to the best of my knowledge, no scheme of this nature has up to the present been subjected to practical trial in Persia. It is conceivable that it might provide an improve ment on the present system of Government, but such projects are usually found more difficult in execution than they appear to be on paper because of the ele ment of human character and cantankerousness which can never be certainly estimated beforehand and is never entirely absent even in the most favourable circumstances. In the present case, however, many difficulties and defects are obvious even at a first glance. Composition of the Government. 3. Firstly there will always be the two antipathetic parties of Persians and Europeans in the supreme Council. There will be two corresponding totally different points of view, and hence a radical division of counsels whether expressed or concealed. Lecoffre thinks a suitable Governor-Administrator can be found in the Zahir-ud-Daulah or another Tehrani whose name I forget, and that suitable secretaries who will really do the work required of them will be forthcoming. Personally I question whether such persons exist in Persia. Persons who would be subservient to Mr. Lecoffre may be found, but that does not necessarily mean good government. 4. The Advising Council will be weak. The Secretaries will presumably be Tehranis. The British Consul is in these days somewhat of a busy person, and C45FDfor some years past the incumbents of the post have not found it possible to * make themselves really acquainted with the people and conditions of the districts. 5. The Gendarmerie Officers will be new and callow, and may or may not be temperamentally suited to become advisers in administrative affairs. In any case they will have their hands more than full with executive military work which should necessitate their constant absence from Kerman. 6. The present Financial Agent is a man of some ability, but his ideas are in many respects curiously limited ; further he is vain and self-centred and more or less frankly ambitious to carve out a great position for himself. He is not ‘ sympathique 1 to any nationality or class. As haying command of the money bags and of certain sources of information, and as being able to devote his whole mind to the administrative and financial problems of the province, he probably counts on being able to exercise a dominating influence in the Council. Granted that one “ Admirable Crichton ” may acquit himself with general applause in such a position, what about his unknown successors in office ? Functions of the Council. 7. The general object of the Council is to initiate an entirely new adminis trative system for the Province and its districts. If any section of the Adminis tration as for example the Finance Department, is to be successfully run on quasi-European lines, it is undoubtedly necessary that the whole Administration should be remodelled on similar lines. The proposal is therefore logical enough. The present mixed system will, I am personally convinced, never yield anything but constant discord and the most indifferent administrative results. I do not know how the experiment is working in Pars, but in any case the position there is different as funds are being supplied from outside. 8. As regards//m 2. The creation everywhere of permanent staffs is certainly desirable, if reasonably suitable men can be found ; but where are they to be found ? Persian material would always require close supervision on the spot. 9. Item 3. It will only be possible to replace local chiefs gradually and the Government must be prepared to put down the rebellions and disturbances which such a course is calculated to produce. 1 he setting up of a Governor in Bampur means the settlement of the whole Baluchistan question. 10. Item 5. Mr. Lecoffre said verbally that this only referred to cases in which satisfaction was not obtained by means of the ordinary machinery. It means the subordination of the Karguzari to the Provincial Government which would probably be objected to by the central Government. It would also mean that the Council would add to its other functions that of High Court of the Province. 11. Salaries need not at present be discussed in detail, but the rate for “ Munshis” appears to me very low. Armed Forces. 12. This programme proposed is far beyond the powers of two men. Its possibility at all depends on ample funds being available. Agriculture and Commerce, etc. 13. All the objects stated are desirable; but who is going to undertake them ? s 6 The opening and keeping open of roads requires funds and sufficient organ ised armed forces. 14 14. The scheme as a whole upsets the entire existing arrangement of authority, and in particular proposes to attack and abolish the acquired privileges and powers of local chiefs. At the same time it provides for no direct immediate supervision of the government of the districts. It is likely on these accounts tolead to unrest and discontent, and tomeet these it must be backed by ade quate and efficient force available at any point. The scheme savours to me strongly of the Headquarters’ Central Office and the bureaucrat, whereas successful administration begins from the bottom and is chiefly determined by the honesty and efficiency of local officials whom it is the business of the Headquarters in the first place adequately to support and in the second place adequately to supervise. 15. Mr. Lecoffre would no doubt say that these proposals represent his ideas of what is ultimately desirable, rather than schemes immediately realisable. But I doubt if he has any notion what an exacting and arduous labour is success ful administration nor how great the gulf between things desirable and^ their realisation in practice, i.e. y how theory must constantly be adapted to the limita tions of practicable possibility. Where the theories emanate from a group of partially-informed European advisers and their execution depends on Persians, what result is to be expected ? Either the Europeans will be flouted and out raged by having their theories and proposals ignored or rejected by the executive, or they will be made responsible for the results of the miscarriage of impractical or maladministered schemes which they have recommended. ^ 16. These objections will apply to all schemes of putting new patches on old garments, and the question is really one of the Policy which Britain proposes to adopt in regard to Persia in the years immediately before us. If Persia is to be left to conduct its own executive, then such half and half schemes with Persian officials and European advisers will probably afford some slight improvement on a purely indigenous system, from which few people with a first-hand knowledge of Persia now expect anything but a continuous increase in the existing anarchy. Schemes of this nature, if little likely to solve the problem of Modern Persia, would be interesting experiments and would provide a useful experience which is at present, as far as I know, entirely lacking to us. To me personally it appears that we are not at present in a position to say how a Province ought to be managed, and should we ever, as is admittedly pos sible, have to undertake the executive Government of Southern Persia we should do so without real knowledge or experience. 17. On these grounds I would recommend that this proposal of Mr. Lecoffre’s, however fantastic it may appear in some of its aspects, should be accorded serious consideration, special attention at the same time being paid to ^ the question of securing for the Representatives of the British Government an effective measure of authority, vis a vis, in particular, the other European “ Mem- i bers of Council. ” Copy forwarded to His Majesty’s Political Resident, Bushire, under this office letter No. 37-657, dated 26th June 1913.

(No. 157.) Tehran, July 8 , 1913. ir&gt; ^YXTH reference to my telegram No. 249 of the 26th ultimo, in which I had the honour to inform you that the Persian Government have decided to immediately extend the scope of the operations of the national gendarmerie under Swedish instructors to the urovince of Kerman, and in other directions, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a letter addressed to the Minister of the Interior by Colonel Hjalmarson, m which that officer repeats a request formerly made for an increase of the numbers of the Swedish military instructors in the service of the Persian Government. The first point made in Colonel Hjalmarson’s letter to Am-ed-Dowleh concerns the section of the Tehran-Bushire road between Kashan and Yezdikhast. It is clearly most desirable, if the necessary funds are forthcoming, that this gap m the chain of police protection on this most important trade route should be filled up^ as soon as possible. For this purpose Colonel Hjalmarson considers that the services of four additional instructors are required. . . . , w ,, . # ^ The colonel then proceeds to show reason why it is necessary that the stall of instructors at Shiraz should be increased by two officers, a doctor, and a veterinary surgeon. The experience of the recent march to Shiraz has proved that it is not sufficient to rely upon the skill of Persian practitioners. On that march several ives were lost that could almost certainly have been saved had the force been accompanied ^ &amp; FurtherPt having been decided by the Government that it is desirable that the gendarmerie should be established in the province of Kerman as soon as may be possible, Colonel Hjalmarson asks for three executive instructors, an accountant and a doctor for the organisation of the force to be raised there. In conversation (Lionel Halmarson as told me that he proposes to send a force of 150 and 200 men to Kerman at the end of the present month fhen the somewhat longer and cooler nights will make marching possible The force will be commanded by two tried officers who have been some time in Persia, and have a knowledge of the language and people I would beg to call your attention to the request for an officer to replace Major Petersen.

With reference to your telegram No. 5 °* A scheme for the re-organization of the administration drawn up by Lecoffre ,ad akeady been VuLitted to me by him. He informed me ^at the Treasurer- general had advised him to obtain my support and that when he had done so, he Mornard) would discuss the matter with Your Excellency. The proposals contained in the scheme may be summarised as follows f.t The aonointment of a temporary Governor to carry on the admin.stra- ( ) * titm^asiristed by two Secretaries and an Advisory Council which would consist of— {a) His Majesty’s Consul ; ( 5 ) Financial Agent ; (c) 2 Swedish Officers ; (d) the two Secretaries. (zt About ten Agencies, with permanent staffs, to be established to ( } administer the districts. Staffs and administrative officials to receive fixed pay of an adequate amount. My objection to the scheme, I pointed out, was that the two Gendarmerie Officers and one or two Europeans with adv,s ° r J ^'^e^xerche by thenf of a - - ridiculous.2 I append some general comments on the scheme : O) It would appear that in accordance with Lecoffre’s proposals the Gendar merie Officers would be expected to undertake the following measures:— (a) the training and upkeep of the Police and Regular Gendarmerie: (b) an expedition to Baluchistan ; (c) establishment of garrisons; (d) organization of the road gendarmerie; (e) reform of the system of recruiting. Two men could barely undertake the execution of one of these tasks. (2) There is no guarantee that His Majesty’s Consul’s opinion would carry any weight on the Advisory Council, as he would probably be consistently out voted. Besides which he could not undertake the work in addition to his own. (3) Whatever form of administration may be adopted, it cannot prove satisfactory when in Persian hands unless Europeans, possessing intimate local and provincial knowledge are employed to exercise a close supervision over its work. ( 4 ) The scheme is as good as any other that could be drawn up, if viewed in the light of a preliminary measure which will call for completion at some future time. It is claimed by Lecoffre that a great portion of the abuses now practised by officials would die a natural death under the knowledge that their work was being supervised, and that they would be held responsible in the event of discrepancies being detected. In minor financial matters the truth of this statement might be borne out. Lecoffre’s draft scheme will be forwarded by post. Telegram P., No. 71, dated (and received) 20th June 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Political Resident, Bushire. No. 95-) Information has reached me from a reliable source that the Amir Mufakham’s friends in Tehran have advised him, in the event of his being unable to get on with His Majesty’s Consul and the Financial Agent, to resign the Governorship, and that it seems probable he will adopt the course. Rumour also has it that he will be succeeded by Zahir Dowleh. The general opinion is that Lecoffre’s assistant—Ibrahim Khan—has been carrying on persistent intrigues against the Governor. It is said that Lecoffre is entirely under the thumb of his assistant who is now desirous of making a local god of himself on the strength of the fortune that he has amassed. His removal from here would be very welcome to me as I have no trust in him whatever. Lecoffre who has frequently spoken in high terms of Zahir Dowleh, shares his assistant’s notorious hostility to Mufakham. I consider that the latter has acquitted himself far better than the average Governor usually does. In regard to his propensity for peculation, I cannot give any opinion as I have had no agent to watch over his actions and make reports to me, but I do not suppose it is stronger in his case than in that of others of his type. Politically it &gt;is ^undesirable to evince dislike of a Governor without any justification for it. As mentioned in my Diary, paragraph 213 and preceding references, a man I regard as a thorough rascal is one Ali Mohammed.

(June 24, 10 p.m.) YOUR telegram No. 283 of 23rd June. Opposition wliicli I anticipated from the Persian Government to the Kerman scheme may be classed, perhaps, as sentimental, but it will, I am convinced, be determined. The sovereign rights of Persia are held to be sacred, and it would, be considered an unacceptable infringement of those rights to impose employment of British officers on Persian Government at a moment when great efforts are being made to develop gendarmerie scheme under Swedish officers, which Persia has accepted as Hardly a day passes that some member of the Cabinet or other person does not express his deep gratitude to His Majesty’s Government for their forbearance in not taking action in the south and for assistance given to Persia to enable her to send Persian gendarmerie force to Shiraz, that has had such happy resrdts, not so much in what force has done as in moral effect produced by fact that the Government have been able thereby to prove themselves capable of asserting their authority. To this is attributed recent energetic action of Kawam, which has met with so much success, whilst his rival Soulet is co-operating loyally with the Governor-General. It will be argued that a knowledge that His Majesty’s Government have lost patience will have hud effect, and the Government, who rely almost entirely upon British support, will feel that their prop has been kicked from under them. Personally I am of opinion that, if necessary funds were available, a gendarmerie force under Swedish officers could be organised more quickly and more efficiently. Swedes would receive full support of local authorities and of Central Government, ■ and they have established a certain reputation for themselves, whereas British officers would meet with open or hidden opposition on all sides, and force suggested is, I think, inadequate for the purpose. . t i r r. j; ^ ' I trust that the last sentence of your telegram does not imply that I have forfeited your confidence by my frank statement of a question which I consider to be ol vital importance if His Majestv’s Government intend to continue with their policy ot bolstering up an order of things which cannot continue to exist without their support.! her own. / 25 JUN1913 COPY TO INDIA 1790 4911IiA 1^+^ 1 &lt;k.

I am rather surprised to hear that the Persian Government would, in your opinion, resent the suggestion of employing a couple of British officers to organise a road force. There is no question of employing British Indian troops, and I would be ready to refer a^ain to the India Office the question of employing non-commissioned officers from India, if you thought that this modification would make the scheme less unattractive. _ The recent serious robbery on the Kerman road strengthens our position, and might be a peg on which to hang the proposal.

(June 19, 3 p.m.) YOUR telegram No. 277 My Russian colleague and I are both agreed that there is no objection to the Shah’s being proclaimed of age after his next birthday, i.e., in thirteen months’ time, more especially if the Regent returns and himself conducts his political education for a year. There is at the present moment strong movement on foot to summon the new Medjliss with the two Chambers, as provided by the Constitution. The Persian Government profess themselves favourably disposed towards elections at early date, but much outside pressure under the leadership of Samsam-es-Sultan is being- exercised in the same direction. As such a movement may be apparently invested with popular character and may embarrass the Government, I have urged on the late Prime Minister that he must not associate himself with any open movement which may, by an appearance of forcing the Government’s hand, in a measure discredit Cabinet in public opinion. I would venture to suggest that Kerman scheme should be submitted to Regent. I am convinced that it will meet with the strongest possible opposition here, and I am sure that both Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior will resign sooner than accept proposal, which will certainly be considered here as a direct indication that His Majesty’s Government have abandoned their benevolent attitude towaids Persia, and have decided to take the first step towards the partition of the country. If the plan is submitted to Persian Government after the Regent has -visited London, his Highness will certainly be accused of having been party to it. For this reason it would seem only fair to him to tell him of steps which His Majesty s Government find themselves constrained to take.Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 18.)

Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley (Tehran). (No. 272.) Foreign Office, June 16, 1913, 5T5 p.m. VICEROY’S telegram of 7th June regarding British officers for Kermau. Secretary of State for India fully concurs in his Excellency’s conclusions, and considers that consolidation of British influence in British sphere by all legitimate means is very desirable. If Persian Government cannot possibly supply funds for scheme, Lord Crewe is prepared to consider advisability of a further small advance for the purpose. In view of strong opinion expressed by Viceroy and approved by India Office, I cannot maintain your objection to employment of British officers, and I will approach the Treasury in the sense of your telegram No. 205 of 20th May. Russia cannot object as regards British sphere, and the officers might be withdrawn on the extension of the Swedish gendarmerie scheme to Kerman.From Viceroy, 7th June 1913. Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 27th May. British officers for Kerman. In view or paramount importance, both on political and commercial grounds, of securing safety of trade routes in Southern Persia without further delay, proposal has our strong support. It is quite clear that no Swedish gendarraane force can be provided for Kerman for a Jong time, and in the meantime our trade is suffering seriously and our credit being impaired in .British sphere. We cannot agree with Sir W. Townley that Russia will have any reasonable ground of protest if British officers are employed in our own sphere or can legitimately demand quid pro quo in shape of appoint ment of Russian officers in Russian sphere where, in addition to large bodies of Russian troops, theie is already force under Russian officers, and where trade has not suffered from disorder m the same degree. Recent disorder and Baluchi raids in neighbourhood of Bam afford strong grounds for pressing proposal on Persian Government, and for requiring them to provide funds for the purpose. In our view it will be difficult to resist much longer appeals of British and Indian trade lor protection of its interests. Immediate employment of British officers in Persian servdce in Kerman is consistent with our policy, as presenting a reasonable prospect of securing maintenance of peace and order without resort to expedition. Moreover, the presence of two British officers in Kerman who could get into touch with local tribal Ghiefs should afford invaluable assistance in operations for suppression of arms traffic, for protection of telegraphs, and in prevention of trans-frontier raids.Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward G'-ey.—(Received June 7 , 10 p.m.) (No. 225.) YOUR telegram No. 241 Following from consul at Seistan :— Tehran, June 7, 1913. (June 7, 9'15 p.m.) “ 1 beheve that repetition of our warning is and will be regarded as a sign of weakness. Jehind pi of esses to have a grievance against us, and recent telegrams disclose other similar complaints of Baluchis. We have gained absolutely no redress for losses inflicted on British subjects thirteen months ago, but we have sustained no further loss, and I would prefer to hold no direct communication with the natives of Sarhad at this stage. ‘ In my opinion it is an easy matter to punish these tribes adequately. Natives of Sarhad are absolutely dependent upon Seistan and Bam in equal proportions perhaps for all their supplies. Wells between Sarhad and Seistan, Kisnat, and Tah are few and far between. If blockaded for two years, tribes would be reduced to extreme distress. Nasiri-es-Sultaneh himself pointed out this fact to me, but he is not the man to conduct operations, as he is partisan of Hashmat-ul-Mulk. Sending of Khudadad Khan, cousin of Hashmat-ul-Mulk, last year to Meh, to recover loot from their kinsmen, was a futile experiment. It would be equally useless to expect Purdil Khan, Khudadad’s enemy and deputy governor, to support any action against Sarhad or Shaokat. “I firmly believe that, until a disciplined force is sent from Meshed under a Swede, first, to arrest Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and, secondly, punish Khudadad and blockade the natives of Sarhad, we shall see no improvement. Khudadad is the Belgians’ most active opponent in Seistan.” I am making energetic representations to Minister of the Interior, but we must rely for the present upon such action as I can induce Persian Government to take, as I see no immediate probability of Swedes being able to extend their operations to Seistan. &lt; 790—108]£r Enclosure A'O.

From—His Majesty : s Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. Referring to my telegram No. 5, His Majesty’s Government have been unable to see their way to making any special advance for the administrative purposes of Kerman. I shall continue to urge upon the Treasurer General the importance of furnishing the money required whenever funds come to hand. Telegram No. 12, dated iSth February 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. With reference to your telegram No. 10. Would it be impossible to indue e the Foreign Office to reconsider their decision? The measure proposed would have a decidedly restraining effect on the Bakhtiari, and quiet the anxieties of those who are not rebellious, and at the same time it would strengthen our prestige within our own sphere of influence. If it is not adopted, accusations of injustice will later be brought forward and we shall find ourselves obliged either to condemn the Governor General or to support him without sufficient knowledge. Lecoffre is ready to furnish Steward with some tumans 5,000 with which to grease the wheels, and clear up minor cases of injustice. We should also acquire knowledge incidentally of the country and the people which is a distinct desidera tum in this office. I saw Lecoffre again yesterday, and his good sense and reasonableness con tinue to impress me. He hopes shortly, as soon as the Bank specie has arrived, to be able to provide the funds necessary for starting for the Governor. From independent sources it is known that the latter is arranging in the districts for the supply of transport. Up to the present he and Lecoffre sing each other s praises, though of course with reservation.

I have to-day sent the following to the Foreign Office 28. 'According to report from His B f. an o ^ u ^^’unfeM^ is furnS the Governor-General there is in serious need &gt; , - s grave danger of within a fortnight with 40,000 tumans arrears ue . coas t an d to disturbances accompanied by the closing of the trade r the interior of the country.I am ureine M. Mornard to send funds but I would beg to represent for vour consideration the great desirability of making some arrangement for Kerman out of the next advance similar to that arranged for in the case of Pars. The cost of the administration is .estimated at tumans 20,000 per mensem, and the Governor-General can do nothing if he is not prov.ded w.th funds required for measures necessary for re-establishment of order and for the keeping open of the valuable trade routes. Telegram F., No. 7, dated 25th January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. In continuation of my telegram No. 3. M. Lecoffre, the Financial Agent, paid me a visit and was insistent that 1 should wire to you enquiring what the reason has been for his appointment to Kerman instead of to Shiraz. He conjectures that it may be due to political or diplomatic considerations, as he has failed to elicit an explanation from Mornard. He says he wants to know “ for his future guidance.” Lecoffre says that he will do all that the Governor-General makes possible, and that he has made up his mind not to worry or quarrel, satisfying himself with throwing on the shoulders of the Governor-General any failure to collect or pay in the revenue. He will not go against local customs. He says that the records in the Financial office are in a disgraceful state and he is unable as yet to say how things stand. He entertains distrust of both the Governor and the Assistant Financial Agent, the latter of whom he knows and would like to have replaced.^ Without committing myself to a judgment on the merits of the mutual accusations of the two, I referred to the apparent desirability of using all lawful means to maintain the Governor whose regime up to the present had been generally satisfactory. He appeared to acquiesce fully in this view. Financial Agent’s manner and personality, however, as I daresay you are aware, are unhappy, and according to his own statement he opened his relations with the Governor by aggressively asserting that he would not submit to any but properly respectful treatment at his hands. I have received your telegrams Nos. 4 and 5 since writing the above. Telegram P., No. 6, dated (and received) the 26th January 1913. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty's Consul, Kerman. With reference to my telegram No. 5. The Foreign Office is asking whether, if he is furnished with sufficient funds, the Governor-General would have at his command force adequate for the restora tion of order, as were it not so then expenditure would be futile. Will you please let me know your views regarding this, and also whether you think that it would be sufficient to guarantee him 30,000 a month for a period of six months in order to enable him to start out. Telegram P., No. 7, dated (and received) 26th January 1913. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty's Consul, Kerman. With reference to your telegram No. 7. Please convey to Lecoffre that his appointment to Kerman was considered expedient owing to the fact of the special interests which the British Government has in that province. You should let him understand at the same time that themove was not caused by any outside pressure, but merely recommended itself as a more suitable arrangement. It is my earnest hope that he will give best endeavours and assistance towards straightening out the confusion of the finances, which I can quite believe to be tolerably hopeless. I also trust that he will find a way of co-operating cordially with the Governor, and that while upholding the dignity of his own position he will not forget that he is in the service of the Persian Govern ment and that the Governor is a high official under the same government and as such entitled to a high degree of respect. Private. —L. is a hopeless madman. I am afraid you will find him very hard to get on with but I hope that you will manage to do so and be able to control him. He was thrust upon us by public opinion because Russia demanded his expulsion. Telegram P., No. 8, dated (and received) 28th January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. With reference to your telegram No. 3. The sum of tumans 20,000 have been remitted telegraphically to Kerman, and I have received promises that as soon as money is available in the Bank a further similar sum will be remitted by telegraph. Telegram P., No. 9, dated 28th January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. In reply to your telegram No. 6. I think that the Governor-General will meet with no opposition at Bam, Narmashir, or Rudbar. Then his way will be cleared through the Afshar and onwards by the renewal of his prestige and the internal dissensions existing in that tribe. His force, it is true, is comparatively small, and I can give no guarantee against contretemps, and prophets of evil are to be found. Yesterday I discussed at length with the Governor-Generarnis plan of action and the financial position. He is full of confidence and I think that should he fail he would be a real sufferer himself. He postulates starting not later than the 2nd Rabi-ul-Awwal on the grounds that later on in the season there will be heat and the return of the Pars nomads to Kerman territory to be reckoned with. The sum of 40,000 tumans immediate cash is z sine qud non. For the time being I did not judge it necessary or expedient to hint at a guarantee of 20,000 tumans per month for six months, but I assured myself that the im me late necessity for 40,000 tumans would not be obviated by any guarantee. On the other hand if the Government gets that sum he will move out, pay his own way, and settle accounts with the Financial Office on his return. If this is agree o he has no anxiety about being able to secure satisfactory Jot 'W year. Otherwise he claims another 20,000 tumans due to him on 12th Rabi-ul-Awwal and retires at Nauruz. Although he is a Bakhtian, personally I would prefer to put my money on him to following any other course open. Telegram P., No. 10, dated ist February 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. With regard to your telegram No. 8. Lecoffre has received the 20,000 tumans from the Treasurer General with instructions to apply it to current expenses. Fe submits that there are two kinds of expenditure, Ordinary and ordinary, the latter of which would include the expenses of expedition by thefnvprnnr.General, and that he has accordingly allotted the above mentioned sum for the immediate ordinary wants of the administration. He asks for i to.ooo tumans working capital with which to begin and to j -nrv thp vear and in addition to this there will probably be necessary toH^eSditreKpenditure of the year a sum of not less than .ao.ooo tumans of which 40,000 should immediately be given cash to the Amir as proposed by us. I informed him that the Amir had given his promise to start out on receiving 40,000 tumans. Can you induce Treasurer General to instruct Lecoffre to pay the whole 40000/the Governor General on satisfactory assurance that he will start, and to’ put-off reorganisation until he receives further funds from Tehran. Telegram P., No. n, dated 1st February 1913* From—His Majesty's Consul, Kerman, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. In continuation of my telegram No. 10. Lecoffre’s Scheme and proposals are as Mows Funds. Initial capital required for ordinary expenditure : Arrears to about 17th January ... Account expenses of Governor and Treasury up to Nauruz ... For Governor from Nauruz to end of July Expenses of Treasury for one year from Nauruz Tumans 25,000 ,, 24,000 „ 37»ooo „ 25,000 Total 110,000 Extraordinary expenditure, e.g. t pacification of the province: probably some 120,000 to 150,000, of which 20,000 to 40,000 should at once be given to the Governor-General. This estimate does not include the expenses of the Karasuran and Qushun, for which L. hopes to be able to make provision by temporary expedients. It should be remarked that 10,000 of the Governor’s monthly allowance of 20,000 is on account of these items, and the remainder for himself and his Bakhtiaris. Lecoffre is of opinion that there is some 10,000 revenue which could be easily collected at present, but he does not venture to count on it. Taking into account the oppression exercised last year little of revenue out standing can be collected, and consideration should be shown towards the people during the coming year. Administrative. Lecoffre insists on the necessity of his having a reliable force at his disposal, and entreats that the Legation will arrange for the appointment of two Swedish officers, at least, to take over charge of the local forces and organise them. If this is not done the Financial Agent will within a year fail utterly. The deputation should be carried into effect without giving any warning before hand of intention to the Local Authorities. Lecoffre will send an Agent to accompany the Governor-General if latter sets out, to keep the accounts. He has, however, informed the Governor-General that he can make use of revenue collected provided that he renders true account of it. He is very anxious that we should depute an adviser to accompany the Governor, and suggests for the post Lieutenant Steward, I.A„ who is now here studying Persian.»t 5 I am not yet in a position to express strong opinions, but the reasonableness of Lecoffre’s tone has agreeably surprised me and I am disposed to concur in his financial proposals should they be practicable. The matter of the Swedish officers js one which primarily depends on our general policy in Persia and which without fuller knowledge I am unable to discuss. The control, assured though indirect, of an armed force would doubtless be gratifying to Lecoffre’s self-importance, but it is probable that it is in fact necessary in order to secure efficiency. The despatch of a British Adviser with the Governor-General would help to prevent excesses, and would strengthen our hands in supporting him should he prove himself worthy. Steward is 27 years of age, is sensible and intelligent, has a fair working knowledge of Persian and should do well. An unconfirmed report just received announces the serious robbery of a Hindu caravan in Jiruft accompanied by the death of eleven Persians. This, if true, renders more than ever urgent the departure of the Governor-General. Telegram P., No. 9, dated 3rd (received 4th) February 1913. From—-His Majesty Minister, Tehran.

From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. Congratulations on your safe arrival. The Assistant Financial Agent, Mirza Ibrahim Khan, has sent in scathing reports of the evil conduct of the Bakhtiaris at Sirjan. His report is probably exaggerated as the Governor General asked to be relieved, and only at my desire agreed to wait on until Lecoffre should arrive. I shall be obliged if you will let me have your views on this subject as soon as possible. It is certain that the Governor General will seek to convince you that he must have money in order to carry out an expedition in Baluchistan for the purpose of collecting revenue. In Tehran at present there is absolutely no money to be found. You should therefore try and induce the Governor General, if the expedition is really necessary, to arrange to carry it out with locally raised funds. Should it be designed merely for the purpose of rapine and pillage I am not at all inclined to make any serious efforts to arrange for pecuniary aid, which at the moment is quite impossible. A new Cabinet which is waiting'for the approval of the Regent has been brought together under the leadership of the Ala-us-Saltanah. It is possible that if certain demands of the British and Russian Governments are complied with a big loan preceded by a considerable advance may be granted. In that case if I were assured that their powers would not be scandalously abused by the Bakhtiaris, I might be able to arrange that some fraction of the advance should be specially appropriated to meet the necessities of Kerman to be controlled by you in association with Lecoffre in the same way as I have provided for Pars. Telegram P., No. 4, dated 2oth January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, Your telegram No. 2. Of Bakhtiari excesses at Sirjan which as a matter of fact is at present in revolt, I have been unable to obtain confirmation. The Governor General’s own behaviour appears to be good, while that of his agents is not bad. Local opinion of the respectable classes is favourable to him. Lecoffre arrived at Kerman on the 17th January.I saw the Governor General yesterday, and he puts his case as follows He is destitute of funds and the Persian Government owes him on account ne is months the sum of tomans 40,000. This sum ■ { h L S a t Ssltelv lute immediately, and if he does not get it. he will be ,S \,An P nter oTanrexpedition, or to remain on as Governor. He is support- bfhimself on loans with difficulty, and is beginning to be obliged to part with hif Bakht ari forces. He demands that the Ass.stant Fmanc.al Agent s accounts be subiected to examination (he has had no access to them) w.th special reference to the collection of revenue in kind. If within ao days he is given the tomans . &gt; 7 yyKgrtg £ Shfu'lTh' luiftaJdala, Llg, the tribe, -ill get «« .1 lund, the toad, .ill be closed, and disturbances will commence in the city. My own views (please remember that I am not entirely new to Persia and the Bakhtiaris) are as follows:— We should accept case put forward by the Governor, and do all m our power to meet his wants speedily. Any change of Governor and equally further pro- 1 nmaet inaction on his oart would be disastrous. In either case we shall have to face the closing of the routes which is the one matter of real importance to us. I think that there is no reason to question but that he is without funds an cannot in present circumstances raise them except by criminal force. I sha t y and find out what Lecoffre can and will do. Neither of us has as yet seen him. You will probably press the Tehran authorities to instruct Lecoffre to meet the Governor’s demands so far as may be just and possible without delay, but it is to be anticipated that he will in any case demand time, and I would recommend for your consideration the expediency of our being prepared to give within three weeks pecuniary help to the Governor, if possible against the security of the Kerman revenue. The Governor General repeats his promises to co-operate heartily with Lecoffre each acting strictly within his own sphere. He professes to have proots of dishonesty on part of Assistant Financial Agent, and asks for the right ot inspection, without that of control, of revenue accounts. : i ** ct •-.) - ** ’ ; ■ V' a‘. t: rh ■ | v' £.&gt;.« j. ^ -L . .t ii ': i «.«?

Sir, . ^ t Foreign Office, March 25, 1913. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant regarding the proposed financial advances to the Persian Government. With regard to the Marquess of Crewe’s suggestion that a further sum of 10,000L should be earmarked out of the Anglo-Indian share of the advance of 400,000L for the restoration of order and for general administrative purposes in the province of Kerman, Sir E. Grey is of opinion that the negotiations are now too far advanced to render it desirable to revise the conditions of the advance, and does not therefore propose to send any instructions to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran regarding the province of Kerman. With reference to the proposal contained in the last paragraph of your letter under reply, I am to state that Sir E. Grey concurs in his Lordship’s view that the repay ments of capital on account of the sum of 140,000?. advanced in 1912 had better be postponed until the 21st March, 1915. I am, Ac. LOUIS MALLET.

This suggestion, it may be observed, would meet the view expressed in Sir W. Townley’s telegram No. 88 of the 3rd March, 1913, and its adoption, as pointed out in Sir E. Grey’s telegram to Sir W.

I am convinced that the present Cabinet has no wish to accept advance even for a large sum unless there is real hope that such temporary assistance will be followed at an early date by a loan of such dimensions as will give Persia a chance of recovering herself. Neither Cabinet nor treasurer-general will accept a Russian advance on the same terms as the last one unless they have good ground to believe that loan will follow shortly. As to financing the gendarmerie in Pars or the provincial administrations, I am convinced that money as expended would be wasted unless a strong Central Govern ment is established which can back up such organisations and make itself felt and respected in provinces. Without much more stable funds than are offered by advances it will be quite impossible to create such a Government. There are already signs of impatience on the part of certain members of the new Cabinet because funds upon which they counted on taking office are not yet forthcoming. As I have reported before, these men accepted office from patriotic motives, and they are not prepared to endeavour to carry through the hopeless task of administration with an empty exchequer.

(January 31, 9'25 p.m.) YOUR telegram No. 46 to Tehran. I again pressed question of advance on Minister for Foreign Affairs, and said that Persian Government urgently require 600,000?. He is apparently awaiting granting of railway concessions before discussing matter with the Minister of Finance, but he has now promised to speak to the latter at once. His Excellency is greatly disappointed at hearing from Russian Ambassador that British group of “ Commission d’Etudes ” decline to send a representative to Tehran. He said that this refusal on their part would render it almost impossible for us to arrange for a large loan, as such a loan would only be in connection with railwav project.CONFIDENTIAL. Cv Sir Edicard Grey to Sir W. Townley (Tehran). (No. 46.) Foreign Office. January 30, 1913, 1 p.m. YOUR telegram No. 32 of 26th. January : Persian finance. A large loan such as the Persian Government desire cannot be floated, or even seriously considered, till some measure of order is restored, and all that can he done is to advance just enough to keep the administration going and subsidise the gendarmerie in Pars. As regards the advance for general purposes, we must wait and see how much the Russian Minister of Finance can be induced to give, and then, when the two railway concessions are granted, advance an equal sum. You will have seen from Sir G. Buchanan’s recent telegrams repeated to you that Russian share is unlikely to amount even to 250,000/., still less to the 300,000k desired by the Persian Government. As regards the gendarmerie in Fars, we are ready to advance 100,000Z. as soon as 15,000Z, advanced last December is all used up, paying, say, 8,000Z. a-month (of course under proper control as to its expenditure), for the purpose of protecting the trade routes in the south, till that sum is exhausted (see your telegram No. 17 of 12th January, last paragraph). You should, however, obtain from the Persian Government in return for this advance as many as possible of the conditions proposed by Sir P. Cox to safe guard our legitimate interests (see your telegram No. 31 of 26th January), as modified by Government of India in their telegram of 24th January to India Office. (Repeat to St. Petersburgh, No. 78.)Property of His Britannir. Majesty’s Government.] If / nu. u C ^.y, iui instance, to snow wtiat direct interest India has in the continuance of constitutional rule m Persia, and it will be very easy and not unreasonable for Indian politicians to ask why they should pay for the security in Persia of a constitutional system strictly denied to themselves. It is true, again, that India is part of the Empire and shou Id take its share in the burdens of Empire. The moment, however is not a nappy one for resort to this line of argument, as Indians are now sharply resenting a denial to them of equality of citizenship within the Empire, by colonial communities not themselves- contributing to its defence. It may be true, indeed, that order in Persia might help Indian commerce. But Lord Morley is not convinced that improvement in the sphere of Indian trade by means of this kind is assured enough to justify the impo sition of new burdens upon the general body of Indians. Nor is he convinced that eveiy the conversion of the Persian debt would strike either the judgment or the imagination of the Indian taxpayer as a specifically Indian interest. While, therefore, he is reluctantly obliged to assume responsibility for the loan of 100 ,000/^to which he agreed in May last, Lord Morley is not prepared to recommend his council to sanction any further advance.
