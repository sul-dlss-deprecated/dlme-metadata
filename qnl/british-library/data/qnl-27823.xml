I»Ir. Donaldson. Please see Sir R. Hay^s letter of the 5th December, below. I think the procedure in paragraph 3 of your letter of the 28th November is correct. It now appears that there has been ne arrangement whereby the Sultan' s per mission was not required for visits of Royal Indian Navy vessels. I do not think, however, that wp can assume that the dispensatioif^applaefe equally to ships of the Pakistan Navy. ^ ^ Chefciu, ■ Before writing further to the Political Resident we might get the views of the Foreign Office and the Admiralty.

Stewart has asked the Sultan whether 2 . he wishes his permission to be obtained in future before ships of H.M’s Pakistan Navy and Indian Navy visit Muscat or whether he is willing to continue the previous arrangement.

Uiv? ✓U ext 150 Will you please refer to your letter g^et 2921/47 of the^ 22nd December last about the procedure for visits by His Majesty’s Pakistan ships to Muscat and the Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. We feel on the analogy of the procedure for visits of United States naval vessels to the Persian Gulf, agreed to in our letter No. E 2984/66/91 of the 14th April last to you, that it would be sufficient in the case of the Sheikhdoms for the Governments of Pakistan and India to apply direct to the Political Resident, who since India and Pakistan are still in the Commonwealth might simply notify the Ruler concerned of the visit. In the case of Muscat we consider that the same procedure should apply to His Majesty’s Pakistan and Indian ships. We suggest that the Sultan might therefore be Risked to anre e to extend, the previous arrangement, whereby his permission was not required for visits by ships of the Royal Indian Navy, to include its two successor Navies of Pakistan and India.

She called at Gwadur on her outward journey and arrived at Bahrain on the 20th November, She had to shorten her stay at Bahrain and cut out her proposed call at Huscat as she was summoned back urgently to go into dry dock at Colombo, I exchanged cadis with Commander A, Rashid of the 'Godavari*', who described the ship* s visit to the GuK* as being for goodwill purposes and a relief from the monotony of continuous trips between Karachi and Bombay. The Shaikh of Bahrain was suspicious of the object of the ship* s visit and Commander Rashid attributed diplomatic illness to the Shaikh who excused himself fbom an exchange of cadis on the ground of indisposition. Actually the Shaikh was suffering from a severe cold, H.M.P.S. 'Godavari' was brilliantly illuminated while lying off Jufair on the night of 20th November to mark the occasion of the royal wedding.state tor India in Council sees no objection.

As regards Bahrein (and the other Sheikhdoms) since H.M.G. in the U.K. are the power that represents th« Oheikhn in international relations, the strictly correct procedure would beSifor the Pakistan Government to address H.M.G. either direct er--through/ the *Political ^ /ciu %ai2 Resident, requesting that pprrri'i sfy-beo for^a visit Jae^grsmted.
