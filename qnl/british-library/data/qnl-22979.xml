He estimates the cost at Rs.1,000/-.^ Prices in the local market remain high affecting adversely the cost of various articles such as cloth for liveries, head and footware etc. for menials. In addition it has been found essential to have a direct-line telephone installed in the Indian Assistants court, for which rent has to be provided, extra wooden cupboards are required for keeping old records and stationery, and provision has to be made for a combination safe.

LAUNCH GRANTaajaJL The launch has recently been used for journeys to the Trucial Coast and Qatar, and it is likely that it will be increasingly so used in the future. The consumption of petrol and kerosene will, therefore, proportionately increase, and funds will be required to meet these charges and the payment of the daily (tour) allowances to the Nakhuda, driver and khalasis who man the launch. Uniforms for the crew and cleaning materials have to be met from this grant, and money is also required to meet the high cost of maintenance and provision of spare parts, paint, fish oil, rppe, etc. , ^.Central Contract Grant . The entire Agency building, including the out-buildings and boundary walls, requireiwhitewashing, plastering, painting and cleaning. The Agency jetty and boat house require considerable maintenance; wire gauze is needed for doors and windows in the Agency; and provision has to be made to cover the high labour charges and cost of materials still generally prevailing. — POLITICAL — The issue of the above has been authorised ASSISTANT POLITICAL AGENT, BAHRAIN.

The accounts #f the late Central Government for the period 1st April 47, zo 14th August 47, are being kept open till the 31st March 48, for the adjustment of all transactions relatable to the pre-partition period and occurring in either Dominion after the partition. But after the 31st December 47, only transactions involving Bb. 1 lakh or over will be adjusted against the combined account. Steps should be taken to see that all transactions relating to the pre-partition period are adjusted as early as possible. 2* It has been agreed with the Pakistan Government that each Dominion should aispose of claims arising after the partition in its area but relating to the pre-partition period up to a limit of Bs. 50,000, lists of decisions being sent by each Dominion to the other in respect of all decisions involving over Hi. 10,000. Claims involving over Ifr.50,000 should be decided only after consultation with the other Dominion. The Dominion in which the claim is received should send to the other Dominion wh a self contained statement of the case so that a decision may be reached without the avoidable transit of the files. If in any case the Dominion consulted asks to see the files or it is considered necessary that the files should be shown there is no objection to this being done. 2* All Ministries should immediately review the sanctions issued before the partition and continuing since then to see if any modifications are necessary. In the case of sanctions relating to the Provinces which remained wholly in the Indian Dominion it may not be necessary to doso. But for sanctions issued in the Provinces which have been divided it may be necessary to reduce the scale of sanctioned expenditure. Ministries should use their discretion in undertaking this review which should be completed in a months time , and the result reported to this Ministry. It will be realised that no review is necessary in respect of sanctions operative in those areas which are now included in Pakistan as this is no longer the concern of the Indian Dominion.i No. —61/2.

The following observations are made on the .estimates of excesses and savings:- (a) As revised rates of pay of officers of the foreign Service’ and on ’Contract 1 are less than the I.F.S. scale of pay, and as the posts of Assistant Political Agent and Political Officer, Trucial Coast have been vacant for several months, the estimated savings under pay of Political Agent, Assistant Political Agent and Political Officer, Trucial Coast may be intimated. (b) As Captain M.L.A. Steele, is now borne on Residency establishment rhe estimated saving under pay of Assistant Surgeon may also be communicated. (c) Sanction for sumptuary allowance with effect from 15-8-47 does not exist and as such, it is presumed that the sum of $3,1412/14/- will be a saving. Please confirm. (d) As subsidies on account of air facilities are paid, it is understood, as 'Advances recoverable from H.M.Gr, ' and the system of accounting for the current year is the same as hitherto practised, please confirm that provision for $3.58,500/- provided for by you is not necessary. for Secretary to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf.

A statement showing the anticipated excesses and SH? savings in the budget for the year 1947-48 at the end of the financial year, as far as can be estimated now, is submitted below. Under T.A. an excess of Ks.4930/- is shown. This is b ^ to cover air passage bills of Major Hudson and Major Ranee for which we expect to receive book debits from A.G.C.R. Under Launch Grant we had asked for an extra grant S'7^ of Rs.6000/- but expect to use only Ss.750/- if no special expedditure is incurred. As we &amp;ad already anticipated greater expenditure we can spend more money under this grant. May order launch equipment for Es.2000/- and add that to our anticipated excesses? Under C.C.G. also we had asked for Ss.3,400/- and we expect to spend only Rs.2,400/- in excess of the original allotment even if we spend Rs. 1000/- on the re-wiring of the Agency. This work may be taken in hand as also any other as we are reporting that we sxf&amp;sfc will be spending Rs.2000/- under C.C.G. during February and March. Under Maintenance and purchase of Agency cars we have ^ ^ already asked for an exytra allotment of Rs. 1,583/112/- and provision has been made for xhis amount in this review*. Under Office Allowance we expect to spend Rs. 5800/- S ^ during February and March. This will cover the pay of menials for March which has been asked to be paid during the month of March itself. We acwxttt anticipated this excess even in our first review. Under P c$f T.' Charges we anticipate a saving of Rs. 14,480/- ^ as the expenditure under telegrams ha^Lbeen very low.In Agency Meno No.4056 dated 31-12-47 (S.18) we antici pated savings which have altered now, as detailed below Under pay of P.A. while we expected to save Bs. 11,960/- we are now saving only Rs.4,030/-. This is due to feiiK sanction having cone for drawing officers’ pay at a certain percentage every nonth. Under pay of A.P.A. instead of 6,600 we are saving Rs.8,730/-. This is due to Major Hudson's contract having begun only from January this year. Under pay of Asst. Surgeon we fcacrit xKxxRMdtsxRdk expected to save Rs.5,840/- but are now able to save only Rs.5,100/-. This is because Dr. Steele reverted to his post on the • arrival of the new Residency Surgeon. Under Sumptuary allowance instead of Rs. 1412/14/- we are now saving only Rs. 1265/- as sanction for Major Ranee’s drawing the allowance for the period 15th to 27th Aug.47 arrived and is being drawn here. Another big item of expenditure not provided for in the original budget is the leave of officers. As the sanction for drawing the leave salary has cone fron A.G.C.R. no special explanation is called for. Provision has been made under this head for A.P.A's leave salary being drawn here. There has been considerable saving (Rs.2500/-) under the head Trucial Coast Contingencies. Only an expenditure of y Rs.800/- for pay of car driver and asst, from December onwards has been estimated under this allotment. Other expenses have been covered by the allotment of Rs. 9,400/- under the head 'Purchase and Maintenance of motor car' for Trucial Coast A sum of Rs.5,300/- has been anticipated unddr the head Foreign Allowance to P.O.T.C. and Rs.7,850/- as pay to P.O.T.C. though Mr. Jackson's pay and foreign allowance have not yet been drawn as instructions have not so far been received here for doing so. May the statement be faired and submitted for Signature? N/para ,62 . Launch Grant. Presumption confirmed. We have so far spent in Feb. &amp; March Rs.2284/2/- and have to spend another Rs. 1036/- thus bringing the total to Rs.3320/2/- for these two months and for the financial year a total of Rs. 10,573/12/-.
