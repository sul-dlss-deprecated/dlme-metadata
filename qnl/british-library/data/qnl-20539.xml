I ^ CONFIDENTIAL. ^ S ection 1. I [e 5508/3880/34] mr-tr-ztl^j ^ Sir John Cadman to Foreign Office.-—(Received October 21.) Sir, London, October 19, 1932. A VERY difficult situation having been reached in respect to the relations- between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, I consider it necessary to acquaint you with the present position, and with the circumstances which have led up to it. 2. The Foreign Office is already aware that, from the early days of the company's existence as a commercial profit-earning concern, differences of opinion arose between the company and the Persian Government with respect to the interpretation of the phrase 16 per cent, of the annual net profits,' which defines the company's royalty obligations to the Persian Government under the terms of the D'Arcy Concession. 3. That such differences should have arisen was not a matter for surprise,, having regard, on the one hand, to the lack of more precise definition within the body of the D'Arcy Concession Agreement, and, on the other, to the steady expansion in all directions of the company's business relations and to the inevitably increasing complexity of its financial and accounting arrangements. 4. It was mutually agreed, as far back as 1919, that such a state of affairs, if allowed to continue, would become increasingly embarrassing to both parties to the concession, and the Persian Government therefore deputed Mr. (now Sir) Sydney Armitage-Smith—then their financial adviser—to proceed to England, and, with the assistance of expert advisers, to negotiate a subsidiary agreement with the company, which should regulate the royalty matters then in dispute, and thereafter constitute a basis for the regulation and settlement of the annual royalty payments. 5. Prolonged discussions took place in 1920 between Sir S. Armitage-Smith, aided by Mr. (now Sir) William McLintock on the one hand, and the company'^ representatives on the other which eventually resulted in an agreement, since known as the Armitage-Smith Agreement, being duly concluded and signed on the 22nd December, 1920. 6. The memorandum attached to this letter gives the most relevant and salient points of— (a) Events leading up to, concurrent with, and immediately subsequent to the negotiations. {h) Powers entrusted to the negotiators. {c) The agreement itself. 7. Since the agreement was signed and until a few years back, the agree ment substantially served the purpose for which it had been designed. It must r however, be admitted that the ever-increasing volume and ramifications of the company's business since 1920 led to occasional differences of opinion between the accounting advisers of the Persian Government and the company as to the correct application of the terms of the agreement. These, however, were generally settled by agreement, a relatively small number of disputed points being reserved in the hope that they might all be disposed of en bloc by discussion and settle ment between the Government and the company at a convenient and suitable time. 8. It is relevant to mention at this stage that in 1928, the view was expressed by the Persian Imperial Commissioner (his Excellency Eissa Khan Fayz) that the Armitage-Smith Agreement was invalid on the grounds that {a) It had not received the sanction of the Majlis, and {b) The Government representative had exceeded his powers. Similar views have since been expressed by the Minister of Court (his-- Highness Teymourtache), but there has as yet been no formal denunciation, nor any definite official statement by the Persian Government to any similar effect [607 x—1] BI need hardly say that my company has in no way accepted such a contention. Indeed, had it been formally made, the company would have had no option but to contest the matter before the competent legal authorities. 9. Such was the situation in 1928 when—there being other important but less contentious questions needing settlement with the Persian authorities—a series of discussions took place between his Highness the Minister of Court and myself in London, Lausanne and—later—Tehran. These discussions eventually led in the direction of negotiations for a new form of concession designed, on the one hand, to admit of a shareholding participation of the Government in the company's operations and profits, and, on the other, to secure to the company a considerable extension of the concessionary period which, under the existing concession, expires in 1961. 10. Considerable progress was made in drafting a new Concessionary Agreement, which, in form and largely in substance, might have proved satis factory to both sides. In the final stage, however, when the actual extent of participation came under review, it became quite impossible to reconcile the demands of the Government with those which, though actuated with the strongest desire to come to a generous and lasting settlement, I found it possible to concede on the part of the company. The large royalties which were at that time accruing to the Persian Government owing to the favourable market conditions, had whetted its appetite for more, and—in substance—its new claims were based on a series of formulae calculated, under conditions of commercial prosperity such as were then existing, to give it a much larger maximum whilst securing to it an excessively high minimum, however adverse future trading conditions might become. 11. Finding it impossible to induce the Government authorities to take a more practical view of the matters at issue, I left Tehran in April 1929, not without hope that time and reflection would bring them to a more reasonable state of mind, the more so as the Minister of Court gave me to understand that he would again consider the matter and put forward new proposals. 12. No new proposals, however, were put forward, nor was any further progress made until the autumn of 1931, when, at the instance of the Minister of Court, prolonged discussions took place with him in London and Paris, with the double object of coming to a new agreement which should take the place of the Armitage-Smith Agreement, and of settling the accrued differences in respect to royalty payments between 1920 and 1930. Since the views already expressed by his Highness Teymourtache and the Imperial Commissioner had made the actual question of the validity Of the Armitage-Smith Agreement a contentious matter, it was agreed on both sides to conduct the negotiations with as little reference to that agreement as possible—and, so far as it proved possible, this was done. 13. These particular negotiations, which also covered the newly-raised question of income tax, were successfully concluded, a draft agreement was drawn up, which it was the intention to make operative from the 1st January, 1932, and a further agreement was made with respect to settling the accrued differences to which I have already referred. The agreement was subject to the principles enunciated therein being put into proper legal and accounting form by the advisers of the two parties, and, thereafter, to the approval of the Majlis. 14. Unfortunately, before these final stages had been attained, the annual •general meeting of the company took place (June 1932), and the amount of royalty for 1931 was thereupon notified to the Persian Government. Owing to depression in the oil industry the amount was naturally far below that of earlier and more prosperous years. Warning of this had been given to the Minister of Court during the negotiations above referred to in London, and also both to him and the Finance Minister by our resident director in Tehran. No actual figure was mentioned, but it was stated that the royalty would certainly not exceed £500,000; as a matter of fact, it ultimately worked out at approximately £307 000 as compared with £1,288,312 of the previous year. 15. In spite of the warning given, this announcement evoked strong protest by the Persian Government, and led to invidious and misleading comparisons between the share of the Persian Government by way of royalty and that of the British Government by way of income-tax and dividends. In violent press and parliamentary propaganda, obviously inspired by the Persian Government, the company has been publicly accused of falsifying its accounts and wilfully3 defrauding the Persian Treasury. The new Royalty Agreement referred to above has been completely shelved, in face of what is termed ' public opinion,' and the Persian Government has actually officially refused acceptance of the amount of royalty due to it, on the ground that it is non-acceptable owing to its- inadequacy. The company has invited the closest scrutiny of its accounts by the expert advisers of the Government, but the invitation has not been accepted. 16. Mr. Jacks, the resident director in Tehran, in the course of recent conversations, both with the Minister of Court and the Finance Minister, has gathered that new proposals are under contemplation, and will shortly be put forward, in respect to the Government's concessionary relations with the company. Proposals of this character were promised several weeks ago, but have not so far matured. 17. In the meantime, my board view with much concern the fact that inspired statements have appeared in the Persian press, not merely hinting at, but actually endeavouring to justify, immediate Government action in the direction of a forced revision of the concession, or, inueed, of its entire cancellation. My board take particular exception to. a pronouncement—apparently official—by the Persian Legation in Berlin, of which a translation is attached. I do not, at this stage, propose to deal with the many travesties and misrepresentations of facts and events which characterise this and other published accounts, whether officially inspired or not, but it will be appreciated that the attitude adopted by the Persian Government is far from indicating any real disposition to discuss its past differences, or its ambitions for the future, in a just and reasonable manner. I have judged it advisable to submit this account of the impasse at which this company has arrived in its relations with the Persian Government,, and of the events which have led up to it, since any ' proposals ' which that Government, as at present advised, is likely to put forward to the company, will not improbably be both impracticable in character and peremptory in tone, in which case a situation may well arise in which this company—although most anxious to avoid doing so—may find itself under the necessity of seeking the aid and intervention of His Majesty's Government. I have, &amp;c. JOHN C ADM AN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Note on Armitage-Smith Agreement. IN virtue of the terms of the D'Arcy Concession (which was granted by the Persian Government to the late Mr. D'Arcy in May 1901), the concessionnaire was authorised to found one or several companies for the exploitation of the concession. While such company or companies were to enjoy all the rights and privileges enjoyed by the concessionnaire, they were also to assume all his. engagements and responsibilities. All such companies were, inter alia, to ' pay the said {i.e., Persian) Government annually a sum equal to 16 per cent, of the annual net profits of any company or companies '' that might be formed in accordance with the provisions of the concession The ' First Exploitation Company ' so formed was registered in 1903. In 1908 oil was first discovered in commercial quantities in the concession area, and in 1909 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was formed for the purpose of taking over the concession and assuming all the rights and obligations thereunder. Production of Persian oil on a commercial scale began in 1912, and in 1913 the first royalty to the Persian Government was paid. The company thereafter very considerably extended the sphere of its operations, not only in Persia, but elsewhere. Apart from the exploitation organisation, which it built up in Persia, it created a network of refining and distributing centres throughout the world. Subsequently, moreover, concessions in countries other than Persia were acquired. As a result of the complications [607 x—1] B 2in the calculation of the net profits of the company arising from this ^reat extension of its activities, differences of opinion as to the correct interpretation of the term ' 16 per cent, of the annual net profits ' began to arise between the Persian Government and the company. By 1919 these differences had reached an acute stage, and formed the subject of discussions in London between the then Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs (Firuz Mirza) and Mr. (now Sir) William McLintock, on the one hand, and the company's representatives on the other. These discussions continued into the summer of 1920, but no final agreement could be reached. The Persian Government thereupon decided to entrust the negotiations to Mr. (now Sir) S. A. Armitage-Smith, who was at that time actins: as its financial adviser. The instructions to Mr. Armitage-Smith, which were issued by the Persian Ministry of Finance, on the 29th August, 1920, ran as follows :— ' Monsieur, ' J'ai I'honneur de vous notifier que par la presente vous etes nomm^ comme representant du Gouvernement imperial pour regler definitivement toutes les questions en litige entre the Anglo-Persian Oil Company et le Gouvernement imperial de Perse. ' Dans le cas ou vous jugerez qu'un accord amical sur toutes les questions pendantes, de nature a satisfaire entierement aux droits et aux interets de la Perse, ne soit possible, vous avez I'autorisation d'avoir recours a 1'arbitrage an sujet des revendications du Gouvernement imperial contre la compagnie et d'admettre egalement ce meme procede, si ladite compagnie en exprime le desir, concernant ses propres revendications. ' Pour le Ministre des Finances, ' Le Sous-Secretaire d'Etat, 'E issay.' Mr. Armitage-Smith's understanding of the powers delegated to him is evidenced by the following extract from his report to the Persian Government: — ' It ' {i.e., the agreement) ' does not require or admit of formal approval or ratification, for, under the powers which the Government did me the honour to entrust to me, it is binding. At the same time, it is a source of satisfaction for me to know that the brief resume which I cabled to Tehran met with your Highness's approval, and I venture to suggest that it might conceivably be in the public interest and a copy of this report might be submitted for the information of a specially appointed financial committee of the Majlis, in order that the situation may be generally appreciated.' The discussions between Mr. Armitage-Smith (who was assisted by Mr. McLintock), and the company's representatives in London, eventually led to the conclusion of two agreements. The first of these agreements settled the differences then existing as to the amount of money which was to be handed over by the company to the Persian Government in complete satisfaction of the latter's claims for adjustments in its favour of the royalty payments up to the 31st March, 1919. The agreed sum was accordingly paid by the company, one consideration for the payment being the acceptance by the Persian Government of the second or ' c Armitage-Smith ' Agreement. The main features of the Armitage-Smith Agreement, which was signed on the 22nd December, 1920, were as follows ;— (a) Subject to certain conditions, limitations and exceptions thereinafter mentioned, the Persian Government were to be entitled to receive from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company a royalty of 16 per cent, on all the annual net profits arising from the winning, refining and marketing of Persian oil, whether all the stages of the above processes be handled by the company itself, or through subsidiary companies, &amp;c., and whether refining and marketing takes place within the Persian Empire or not.III V* (b) The Government was not to receive royalty on the profits arising from transporting oil by the company's tankers, but a procedure designed to protect Persian Government interests was agreed for calculating freight rates. {c) The net profits on which royalty was to be calculated were to be the adjusted profits for income tax in the United Kingdom, subject to the various adjustments embodied in the agreement. (d) In arriving at the net profits of subsidiary companies (as defined in the agreement), on which the royalty had to be calculated, the company was to be entitled to make certain deductions in the cases of refining and distributing companies (the principle being that the company was entitled to receive a fair return on its capital invested in the said companies). (e) Special provision was made for the calculation of the net profits on Persian oil in cases where a refining or distributing subsidiary company handled oils other than Persian oil. (/) Further, the company undertook in the agreement ' that it will not enter into any fictitious or artificial transactions which would have the effect of reducing the amount of royalty payable.' As mentioned in the covering letter, the Imperial Commissioner (his Excellency Eissa Khan Fayz) first contended in 1928 that the Armitage-Smith Agreement was invalid inasmuch as (so he claimed)— (a) Sir S. Armitage-Smith had exceeded the powers entrusted to him. (b) The agreement had not received the sanction of the Majlis. The company has always claimed, and still claims, that the Armitage-Smith Agreement is valid unless and until replaced by another form of agreement. In respect to the views of the Imperial Commissioner as expressed in 1928, it is of interest to note the following extracts from letters written by him to this company in 1925 :—&gt; June 5. ' Pains have been taken to draw up an agreement as a guide alike to us as to you, and only by adhering to it can we work in the best mutual interest.' June 22'. ' I am most anxious to reach an amicable settlement of all the questions at issue, whilst at the same time firmly maintaining the rights of my Government on every question of principle as laid down in the agreement of the 22nd December, 1920.' July 15. ' My whole desire is to make the agreement the sure foundation of our actions, and so enable us to work in an amicable and businesslike relationship calculated to further our mutual interests to the best advantage.' Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Translation of an Extract from the ' Berliner B'drsen-Zeitung ' of September 22, 1932. THE Persian Legation in Berlin writes to us as follows in regard to the incorrect statements which have appeared in various papers on the question of the share in profits of the Persian Government in the Oil Company in Persia :— ' The oil concession was granted to D'Arcy in the year 1901. Oil was produced already in the year 1905. The first royalties were paid by the oil company in the year 1914, namely, an amount of almost £9,000. Since that time, and although oil was produced right through the war, not a pfennig6 was paid to the Persian Government during the war period. From 1919 to^ 1930 Persia has not received more than a total of £10 million, although the- profits of the company amounted to more than £200 million. As a result, public opinion in Persia has become dissatisfied with the actions of the oil company, and the Persian Government consider that they should be forced to pay to the Government the share to which the latter are rightly entitled in the colossal profits of the company. In this waly good relations, based on mutual confidence, could be established between the Persian Government and. the oil company.' Berlin, September 22, 1932./ 82/Hf Telegram From To Repeated to XX.

Lengthy note from Persian Government has just reached me. 1. It begins by stating that as my note had based reiteration of demand for withdrawal on the fact that the Persian Government had not advanced any argument which would justify their actinn in aancelling the concession Persian Govern- ment propose to remedy this omission. Then follow the some two thousand four hundred words describing the causes of dis satisfaction with the Company, including 1. concession obtained by pressure, etc# 2. Amount of royalty unfairly arrived at. 3. Persian Government not allowed to check accounts. 4. No royalty paid during war in spite of repeated efforts by Persian Govern ment . 5. Refusal of payment of income tax. 6. Reckless expenditure in other parts of the world to prejudice of Persian Oil Industry. 7. Excessive cost of oil in Persia. 8. Failure fully to exploit their Persian cone essi on ...-2- concession combined with development of fields outside Persia. 9. Refusal to send representative to negotiate last summer. This part concludes: M Under the above cir cumstances as I intimated in my former note the Persian Government consider themselves justified in cancelling D'Arcy Concession and they see no reason to withdraw cancellation. 2. Persia has always respected her international obligations while upholding her rights, and has therefore 'never refused to set forth its difficulties and to expose to competent international courts violations of rights of country.' It continues' In the present instance, as Your Excellency, in name of your Government, and basing yourself on Article 36 of Statutes of the Permanent Court of International Justice, alludes to a reference to that Court, I deem it my duty to draw Your Excellency's attention to the fact that if the stipulations of the Article referred to had placed such questions within the competence of that Court, the Persian Government ,of course, would not have hesitated at all to accept a reference to that Court, but it appears that the Permanent Court of Justice is not competent to examine differences which have arisen between the Persian Government and the Company because Article 36 of the said Statute designates the competence of that Court in such a way, in all cases where reference to the Permanent Court is made on the basis of optional clause, that circumstances of the present case do not correspond with them'. JSote goes on 'Your Excellency repeats in para graph 3 of your note that you consider the Persian Government as . ,.-3- the other hand they have as responsible for losses which the Company may suffer. The Persian Government cannot understand how while on the one hand no participation whatever in the activities of Company, and on they have^not interfered with and do not interfere in the affairs of the Company nor cause them any inconvenience, any responsibility can devolve on them; and it is on the above grounds that I have the honour to reiterate that the Company itself is responsible for any losses which it may suffer.' 4, it then states with reference to the hope ex pressed in my note that Persian Government would come to terms with Company; that they have never refused to do so and continues: 'and the reason why the Persian Government did not take measures after cancellation of the D'Arcy concession to interfere with the Company's institutions and still hold for the time being to the same decision in the hope of attaining the desired result, is that ray Government have hoped that the Company, instead of entering into the sphere of disputes over principles and of Judicial controversy, would not lose the opportunity to send their duly authorised representative to Tehran in order that he might enter into negotiations forth with with the Persian Government with a view to concluding an agreement which would safeguard the legitimate interests of Persia, But in practice it appears unfortunately that His Majesty's Government are perhaps not in favour of such an agreement between the Persian Government and the Company because the threats and intimidation that His Majesty's Government are bringing to bear on my Government and the unacceptable demands that are put forward prevent in practice both the Persian Government and the Company from taking a single step towards reaching a mutual agreement; and although the British Legation has, so far, not interfered in the discussions between the Persian Government and the Company,it has now become an obstacle between •«.-4- between the two parties and has adopted an attitude which does away at once with any hope for success in the conclusion of a new agreement with the Company, and the authorities of Persian Government cannot but regret that, although His Majesty's Government are certainly aware of the deceptions practised on the and of their losses; far from advising Persian Government/|ind encouraging the Company to take advantage of the good faith of the Persian Government and to hasten the amelioration of their situation, are on the contrary encouraging the Company to resist by the pressure that they bring to bear on the Persian Government. The Persian Government consider this attitude of His Majesty's Government as incompatible with the spirit of uprightness and desire for peace that should prevail amiongst friendly Powers and members of the League of Nations and consider themselves within their rights in bringing to the notice of the Council of the League of Nations the threats and pressure which have been directed against therru' - HOARE -THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. i%$\ .41 December 20, 1932.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 191 of the 28th November, reporting the receipt by the resident director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the 27th November of a formal letter from the Minister of Finance cancelling the D'Arcy Concession, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of that document. 2. For some days previously there had been an intensive press campaign advocating this step, but as the Minister of Finance had informed Mr. Jacks that he was on the point of submitting to the company proposals for establishing relations on a new basis, I did not attach to the press campaign the importance I should otherwise have done, but regarded it rather as a demonstration intended to strengthen the position of the Persian Government when it came to actual negotiations. 3. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had just returned from his visit to Geneva and Ankara, and I had already asked for an interview which took place yesterday (the 29th November). 4. After the usual exchange of courtesies, I told his Highness that I did not propose to discuss in detail the action taken by the Persian Government, as I regarded the matter as too serious to do so until I had received your instructions. I wished, however, to know who was responsible. Feroughi replied that he thought that the company was mainly responsible, having, over a considerable period of time, shown no disposition to meet the legitimate wishes and aspirations of the Persian Government. I told his Highness that I was convinced that, if he would examine recent discussions between representatives of the Government and the company, he would inevitably realise that there was no sort of justification for his statement. I begged him to go into the matter carefully in order that, when I received my instructions, he might be in a position to discuss the matter with me. I invited his particular attention to the fact that it was less than ten days ago that the Minister of Finance had definitely informed Mr. Jacks that he was on the point of making formal proposals. His Highness suggested, in reply, that, as the Persian Government had signified their readiness to conclude a fresh concession, the situation was not really so serious as I represented it to be. I replied that that argument could be used in defending the footpad who demanded with threats of force the surrender of a man's pocket-book, but said that, when it had been handed over, he would be prepared to discuss with his victim what proportion of its contents he would restore. 5. I then asked his Highness again who was responsible for the decision and when it was taken. He replied that it was taken by the Government and shortly before his return. I reminded his Highness that, at the audience when I presented my credentials. His Majesty had expressed very clearly his desire that Anglo-Persian relations should be established on a firm basis of friendship. Throughout my time here I had acted on the belief that this was a genuine desire, and in this belief I had exerted myself to the utmost to induce His Majesty's Government to continue friendly negotiations in spite of the demand for which there was no justification on the subject of Hen jam, the only result being that within a day or two of the return of the Minister for Foreign Affairs from abroad the Persian Government had taken a decision for which there was no justifica tion, either from the legal or moral aspect. Was I expected to believe that, in the opinion of the Persian Government, the matter had no bearing on our relations, or had his Department, in fact, been consulted? Feroughi indicated that he did not know. He went on to express regret that an agreement had not been reached (it was not clear whether he meant in respect of the general treaty negotiations or of the affairs of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company), and he went on to say it was [663 u—3]the greatest pity that circumstances had rendered it impossible for you to discuss our relations with him at Geneva. I replied that I did not think he had anything to regret on that score, as, had such a conversation taken place, subsequent events would only have made him ridiculous in the same manner as they had made me. 1 went on to say that matters had, if possible, been aggravated by the manner in which the Persian Government had trumpeted their action abroad and by the public rejoicings in the form of the decoration of the town and the illuminations which I understood had been ordered for that night. Feroughi assured me, almost with emotion, that no such orders had been given. 6. A messenger then came in to say that another foreign Minister had been waiting some considerable time to keep an appointment. I therefore took my leave after Feroughi had once again expressed the hope that a friendly settlement would be speedily reached and his reliance on my good offices, to which I replied that the action of the Persian Government made it impossible for me to advise His Majesty's Government to be conciliatory. 7. Almost immediately after the interview Mr. Jacks telephoned to tell me that the police were removing or defacing the signboards of the company. As I reported by telegram, I immediately rang up Feroughi and demanded that immediate action be taken to put a stop to this. He lost no time in getting into communication with the chief of police, who within two hours had notified the company that he was taking the necessary steps to prevent anything of the sort. I subsequently learnt from Mr. Jacks that the report had been somewhat exaggerated, and that there had only been one case in which the police had given orders for the removal of a signboard. 8. With regard to the public rejoicings, the town was brilliantly illuminated and decorated, if allowance be made for the limited resources at the disposal of the population. The method employed to ensure a satisfactory measure of public enthusiasm was house-to-house visits by the police. My chauffeur was actually in a shop when such a visit took place, and I also have first hand evidence on the point from Mr. Aratoon, the Legation dispenser, who owns a chemist's shop near by, and other sources. The occasion has been, moreover, marked by orders to all cinemas that for three days the public are to be admitted free of all charge. The spontaneous and unofficial nature of the rejoicings has been delicately emphasised by the fact that all public buildings have been left severely undecorated. The fact that the first snow-storm of the year rather marred the celebrations is, I believe, regarded as mildly ominous among some sections of the populace. 9. A curious, and I suppose characteristic, aspect of the situation is that it is, for the moment, widely believed among educated Persians that the cancella tion of the concession is a deliberate piece of play-acting, the theory being that a new agreement favourable to Persia, but prolonging the concession, has already been signed, and that the apparently high-handed action of the Persian Govern ment is simply designed to ensure the smooth passage of the new agreement through the Majlis. 10. I learn that Dr. Friedlieb, a highly intelligent American Jew, now here in connexion with the proposed export monopoly, holds similar views, his variant being that an agreement has been reached on the basis of a 24 per cent, royalty, and that the cancellation of the concession was accepted by the directors of the company as the simplest means of ensuring the acquiescence of the shareholders in this diminution of their profits. 11. Mr. Jacks has learnt from the Administrator-General of Customs that the latter at once asked the Minister of Finance what attitude the customs authorities should adopt, as a result of the cancellation of the concession, towards such questions as to the duty-free importation of the company's stores. The answer was that everything was to go on exactly as before. 12. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 240), the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No. 207), the acting British consul, Ahwaz (No. 85), and to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 119). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE.T-' ^atii mui Enclosure in No. 1. Minister of Finance to Anglo-Persian Oil Company. (Translation.) . 27, 1932. THE Persian Government have repeatedly informed the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that the D'Arcy Concession, dated 1901 a.d ., does not safeguard the interests of Persia, and that it was necessary to place the basis of the relations between the Imperial Persian Government and the company, as soon as possible, on a new basis which would provide for the real interests of Persia. The defects and shortcomings of the D'Arcy Concession and its disagreement with the interests of Persia, as has been repeatedly pointed out, admit of no doubt whatsoever, and, of course, the Persian Government cannot legally and logically consider itself bound by the provisions of a concession which, was granted prior to the establishment of the constitutional regime, in the manner in which such concessions used to be obtained and granted in those times. However, the Persian Government, in the hope that the oil company would take into consideration the needs of the time and the present position of Persia and secure her interests in accordance with these needs, has so far refrained from exercising its right to cancel the D'Arcy Concession. Unfortunately, in the face of the patience displayed by the Imperial Persian Government, the oil company not only has taken no practical step to safeguard the interests of Persia, but the more the Anglo-Persian Oil Company increased its expansion and development the more Persian interests became endangered. Therefore, the Persian Govern ment has lost hope of achieving the object which it had in view, that is to say, of attaining this object by means of negotiations with the company, and therefore realises that the only way to safeguard its rights is by cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession, and this Ministry, in accordance with the decision of the Imperial Government, notifies you that as from this date it has cancelled the D'Arcy Concession and will considerit as void. At the same time, as the Persian Government has no other intention except to safeguard the interests jof the country, should the Anglo-Persian Oil Company be prepared, contrary to the past, to safeguard the interests of the country in accordance with the view of the Persian Government, on the basis of equity and justice, and offer necessary securities for the safeguarding of those interests, the Persian Government will not, in principle, refuse to grant a new concession to that company.

WITH reference to the opening paragraph of my despatch No. 505 of the 30th November, I have the honour to inform you that the resident director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, acting on the instructions of his board in London, replied on the 29th November to the Minister of Finance's letter of the 27th November. His letter denied that the company had ever violated the terms of the D'Arcy Concession, and declared that the company could not recognise the right of the Persian Government to cancel that concession. It also dealt with the argument that the concession was invalid because it was granted prior to the establishment of the Constitution, and refuted the accusation that the company had never taken any steps to meet the views of the Persian Government on the subject of revision. It ended by expressing the hope that the Persian Government would immediately withdraAV their announcement. 2. The Minister of Finance replied on the 1st December in a brief letter stating that the Persian Government did not accept any of the company's declarations or explanations and that the cancellation of the concession remained in force. 3. On the previous day, the 30th November, the Minister of Finance had informed Mr. Jacks that on account of the cancellation of the concession the post of Imperial Commissioner had been abolished and the services of Mirza Eissa Khan Faiz dispensed with. Mirza Mustapha Khan Fateh, the head of the marketing organisation of the company in Tehran, subsequently took the Minister of Finance privately to task for this callous treatment of his representative. Taqizadeh explained that, as soon as the cancellation had been announced, the Persian Government had sent instructions to Eissa Khan to return to Persia. Eissa Khan had replied flatly declining to do so, and the Government had therefore had no alternative but to dismiss him. 4. For the sake of convenience, I enclose herewith a translation of the Minister of Finance's letter of the 27th November, although a copy also forms the enclosure to my despatch No. 505. Copies, or translations, of Mr. Jacks's letter of the 29th November and the Minister of Finance's letter of the 30th November and the 1st December are also enclosed^ 1 ) The Persian texts of all these letters are on record in His Majesty's Legation. 5.

[E 6748/3880/34] Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—{Received December 20.) (No. 515.) Sir, Tehran, December 3, 1932. IN continuation of my despatch No. 505 of the 30th November, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of the note that I addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 2nd December. Your instructions reached me on Thursday afternoon and, as I reported in my telegram No. 201 of the 1st December, I sent his Highness a peremptory message that I wished to see him at noon the following day. As it was a Friday, the interview took place at his house, where I found him reading a theosophical review. It is recorded in my telegram No. 203 of the 2nd December, and there is little that I can add here. Feroughi was obviously upset and apprehensive, but he would not withdraw from the official position that the cancellation of the concession was justifiable and justified. 2. I enclose press extracts giving an account of the speeches in the Majlis on the 1st December, including the statement by the Minister of Finance to which I alluded in my conversation with Feroughi. The statement has few points of interest not already covered by the original letter and may upon the whole be regarded as a rather pitiful attempt by a normally honest-minded man to explain away an act of dishonestly forced upon him by a stronger mind than his own. It will be noticed that the resolution of the Majlis approving the step taken by the Government was passed unanimously. 3. From Mirza Mustapha Khan Fateh, the head of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company marketing organisation in Tehran, who has had an enlightening private conversation with the Minister of Finance, as well as from other sources, I gather that immediately after his return from the south on the 14th November the Shah ordered a startled Cabinet Council to annul the concession. No Minister appears to have had the courage to point out either the dishonesty or the danger of such a course, and some even seem to have thought that there was no real harm in it, the supposition being that His Majesty's Government might make a yro forma protest, after which everything would go on as before until a new agreement had been reached. Taqizadeh did, however, he claimed, persuade the Shah to insert the passage stating that the Persian Government were willing to consider a new concession, which did not figure in the original draft. The Shah probably todk his decision in a moment of impatience at Teymourtache's failure to reach a settlement with the company after four years of bargaining, his impatience being founded upon a very real and permanent determination to acquire a larger share in the profits of the company. His foreign contacts are so few and he appears to be so much at the mercy of his impulses that it probably never occurred to him that his action would affect Anglo-Persian relations in any sphere except that of the company, and even then he may have thought that only the company would be concerned. 4. It seems quite certain that instructions were sent to all provincial centres to celebrate the occasion by decorations and illuminations, and that the public rejoicings were organised and enforced by the police as was the case in the capital. There have, however, been no reports of any attempt to interfere with the trading operations of the company. 5. Mr. Monypenny reports that in Khuzistan itself the news was received calmly enough, although the usual celebration was organised at Ahwaz. No attempt has been made to obstruct the company's work, either at the oilfields or Abadan, and there is no reason to doubt that all local officials, including the customs authorities, have received instructions that for the time being everything is to go on as before. ( 1 ) Not printed. [663 u—5]2 6. Mr. Elkington, the general manager, was at first apprehensive that the local authorities would be uncertain how to act, and might in consequence fail to suppress with sufficient energy any signs of agitation that appeared among the workmen; but I trust that this danger will not arise for the present. 7. I am sending to you, separately, copies of the correspondence exchanged between Mr. Jacks and the Minister of Finance, and a collection of press cuttings. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 244) and His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 122), and copies of the despatch, without the press extracts, to the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 210) and the acting British consul at Ahwaz (No. 87).

HIS Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have taken cognisance of the terms of the letter addressed by the Minister of Finance to the Resident Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the 27th November (6th Azar, 1311). His Majesty's Government consider the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the company's concession to be an inadmissible breach of its terms; they take a most serious view of the conduct of the Persian Government and have instructed me to demand the immediate withdrawal of the notification issued to the company. 2. Furthermore, I am directed to state that while His Majesty's Government still hope that the Persian Government will be at pains to reach an amicable settlement in direct negotiation with the company. His Majesty's Government will not hesitate, if the necessity arises, to take all legitimate measures to protect their just and indisputable interests. 3. Finally, I have the honour to state that His Majesty's Government will not tolerate any damage to the company's interests or interference with their premises or business activities in Persia.

Mr. Hoare to Sir' John Simon.—{Received Decemler 20.) 517.) 7 Tehran, December 3, 1932. ' WITH reference to my telegram No. 201 of the 1st December, I have the honour to transmit, herewith, a record of a conversation by the Acting Oriental Secretary with Vossuk-ed-Dowleh this morning. Summarised translations of the speeches mentioned by his Highness are to be found in my despatch No. 515 of to-day. . - „ • 2. When I saw him two days ago, I was almost painfully impressed by the frank bitterness with which he talked about the Shah's avarice and despotism and of the resultant misery, going so far as to say that if a Minister resigned office he would run quite a serious risk of being thrown into prison. He had himself held successively the portfolios of Finance and Justice under the Shah. At the Ministry of Finance life was one long misery between the Shah's appetite and Dr. Millspaugh's close-fistedness, and so he persuaded His Majesty to transfer him to the Ministry of Justice; that office, however, proved even worse, as under his very nose the Chief of Police organised murders and he was powerless to prevent it. So he made his escape. 3. With regard to his Highness's theory that the Soviets are at the bottom of the attack on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and that Teymourtache has worked in collusion with them, I feel that it is essentially improbable if only because all the indications which we have are that the decision was suddenly taken almost immediately after His Majesty's return from his journey to South Persia, on which Teymourtache did not accompany him; moreover, so far as I can learn, Teymourtache's position is not so secure as to make it likely that he would embark on so dangerous an adventure. I will, however, admit that one of the many stories which is going the rounds is that the attack on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was a gambler's fling by Teymourtache to restore his shattered credit with his master. It is some time since I have seen him. I spoke to him on the telephone last Monday to say that I heard that the town was to be decorated in honour of the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession. For the first time since I have known him he was in obvious haste to terminate the conversation. This could, of course, be ascribed to a guilty conscience, but I am not sure that that would trouble him, and I think it more probable that he was bored at having to tell me things that events were about to reveal as glaring lies. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 245), His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 123), the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 211), and the Acting British Consul at Ahwaz (No. 88). I have, &amp;c. ^ R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. Interview with His Highness Mirza Hassan Khan Vossuk {Vossuk-ed-Dowleh). I WENT to see his Highness at his invitation this morning. He said that when he had a talk with His Majesty's Minister on Thursday last he had not seen the reports of the speeches in the Majlis on that day concerning the [663 u—2]cancellation of the iVnglo-Persian Oil Company's concession. He had read them yesterday morning and had definitely gained the impression that the Russians must really be behind the Government's action. That impression was strengthened by a visitor who came to see him yesterday. At any rate he wished me to note the various points which led him to believe that Russian influence was at work. (1) In Taghi Zadeh's speech mention was made of the principle that when two persons make a contract, one being weak, and that person subsequently becomes stronger, the former engagement is not binding upon him. This was a Bolshevik doctrine. &gt; (2) In Muhtashim-us-Saltaneh's speech, at the end, a hint was plainly given (' the Government will have to perform its duty at the right time ') that there was an intention to give the concession to some other company (presumably to the highest bidder). (3) In Fahimi's speech the ignorance and indifference of the Government thirty-two years ago were stressed—the same point as mentioned under (1) above. (4) In Dashti's speech (though the speaker was well known for pro-Russian sympathies) details were given of the treatment of the pro-Bolshevik discontent in the oilfields three years ago, which gave ground for thinking that the information was derived from the Russians. Mention is also made of the fact that ' all revolutionary Governments in the world have abrogated all of the agreements and contracts signed and concluded by their predecessors, and Persia has to follow the lead, for no nation should be compelled to starve.'' This has the true Bolshevik flavour. (5) Rahnema gives a number of details (such as the story of the priest who stole the D'Arcy Concession), which his Highness knew must be derived from Bolshevik sources. Vossuk also alluded to the blow which recent arrangements made by Sir John Cadman, Sir W. Deterding, and other oil magnates concerning price policy and control of supplies had dealt to the Russian oil interests. His Highness also mentioned the well-known avarice of the Shah, and the political bias of Teymourtache towards Russia. It would be easy for the Russians to come to an understanding with Teymourtache and to use him as their inter mediary with His Majesty. Vossuk therefore thought that everything pointed to the following :— The Russians had put it into the Shah's head that the British Government were finished, would not pay their debts, and could not strike a blow in their own defence. The Shah would readily believe that from recent history. They had then suggested the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's Concession and the eventual formation of a mixed company similar to the fisheries organisa tion in the north, the Persians to supply the land, foreigners the capital and expert assistance, the net proceeds being divided equally. The Shah would receive a large sum of cash and also a suitable number of shares in the new concern. Perhaps he was wrong, but that was how he interpreted the situation. He, of course, deplored the whole matter, and was aghast at the bad effect which the cancellation would have on Persia's credit. In the circumstances the only thing which the British Government could do would be to maintain their rights first of all by all possible peaceful means, and if these failed, to protect their oil by force. That would very likely mean the end of the present regime, but the new couldn't be much worse than the present. It might not mean the disintegration of the country; the Shah was very clever and might still keep his throne. His Highness mentioned on several occasions the story that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had themselves engineered the cancellation, having previously signed a new agreement; on my assuring him that this was not so he said that the story must have originated through people being unable to believe that the Persian Government would take such a step on its own initiative. This brought him back to his original argument. I thanked Vossuk for his friendly communication and said I would communicate it to His Majesty's Minister, who I knew would be very grateful. He said that in truth he always has been, and remains, a friend of the British, but he was a friend of Persia first of all.He also mentioned that he had that morning received a telegram from a stock broker in London called Lockner (?) with whom his Highness had had some dealings during a visit to England : Lockner said that he hoped Vossuk could secure the southern oil concession for a group in the city which he represented. His Highness looked upon Lockner as a crook, and was taking no notice of the wire. A. C. T. December 3, 1932.donfldentlal. No. D. 4897-N/32.

You will see from Mr- Jack's telegram of today that Minister of Finance is already anxiously loofor compromise. In conversation outlined In that telegram Minister of finance made it clear that Shah was entirely responsible and indicated that His Majesty had hardly given a thought to prohahle British reaction apparently in belief shared by Minister of Finance that Company would at once offer to negotiate. (Only a fev. days before His Majesty had expressed hope to Political Resident Bushlre that his relations with officials were cordial while at Ahwaz he greeted Mr. Jacks with what with him amounts to positive friendliness;, 2. While fully satisfied that line taken by Hie Majesty's Government Is right it has throughout been present In my mind that it may be definitely inadvisable for the present or any other Persian Government to uersuade Shah to accept humiliation involved,in formal withdrawal of cancellation and that at some stage our interests would be best served by helping to build a 'bridge. 3, I submit following for consideration. 4^ 1 shall be authorised to invite Minister for Foreign Affairs to a strictly personal conversation and explain that realising as I do extreme difficulty In which Persian Government find themselves I am anxious uo clo o x ^ uassist them. I propose therefore that they offer to address me a Note in the following sensei- 'Persian Government greatly regret to learn from your representations that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have interpreted letter addressed to Anglo-Persian Oil Company on 27th November as an indication of ill-will towards Company in particular and of hostility to British interests in general. As you are aware it is earnest desire of Persian Government that relations between our two countries may be sincere and friendly and it must be evident to you that our common interest in prosperity of Anglo-Persian Oil Company is alone a sufficient ground for this desireo I .am therefore authorised by my Government to give you formal assurance that they will not regard Company's freedom in negotiations which we understand they are prepared to undertake with Persian Government as in any way Impaired by letter of 27th November. I need not assure you that until these, negotiations have been brought to a mutual satisfactory conclusion the status quo in so far as It affects operations of Company will be fully maintained' w In undertaking to recommend such solution to His Majesty's Government I should say I did so on definite understanding that no rejoinder again impugning validity of concessions would be made to letter outlined in Mr• Jack's teL gram and that a suitable statement would be made in Majlis and due publicity given ta it.

His Imjesty's Government in the United Kingdom have had under consideration Your Excellency's Note of 3rd Decemhor replying to my Note cf 2nd recemher in reply to Persian Government's cancellation of Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession. I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that His Majesty's Government are unahle to admit validity of an unilateral cancellation of this concession. Such a cancellation is a confiscatory measure and a clear breach cf International Law committed against a British Company and His Maiesty's. Government feel ohlig to talce matter up in exercise o'^ their rights to protect interests cf their Nationals. His Majesty's Government have from outset as pointed cut in my Note of 2nd December and as repeated in statement made 'by Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in House of Common on 5th December been anxious that an amicable settlement may be reached between Persian government and Anglo- Persian Oil Company. His Majesty's Government cannot however regard Persian Government's iMote of ord Docember as offering any satisfactory basis for such a settlement. As I explained on 2nd December His Majesty'^ Government consider action of Persian Government in camelling£2- cancelling concession to be an inadmissible breach cf terms of that instrument and have therefore renuested withdrawal of Notification to Company on 27th November. Since Persian Government in their reply ar 1 duce no argument which c^n be refB.rded as in 8ny way justifying their action His Mp jesty 1 s Gov er nment must rei ter ate th eii r e n ue st. 2, Should Persian Government be un vT illirm' to withdraw their notification of cancellation tt concession v ithin one week froir ! date of -oresent note i.e. before midday on Thursday December 15th His ivhjesty's Government i - ? ill- have no alternative to referring dispute which has arisen between them end Persian Government in regard to legality of Persian Government action to Permanent Court of International Justice at Hague as a matter of urgency under optional clause.

Further I am instructed to state that my Government do not accent attitude outlined in parawranh 3 of your Note to the effect that Persian Government cannot regard themselves as resnonsible for any damage accruin.?* to Comn^ny. On the contrary I have the honour to inform Your Excellency categorically that His wa.jestj s Crovernment will hold Persian Government directly responsible for any damawe to Company's interests any interference with their premises or business activities in Persia or sny failure to afford Company adequate protection and in the event of any such dwr.age occurring His Majesty's Government will regard themselves, as entitled to take all such measures as situation may demand for Company 1 s protection.

Fowle, With reference to the situation created by the Persian Government's attempt to annul the D'Arcy Concession, I have refrained from writing to you until we could depend on an authentic array of facts as opposed to the mass of rumour which has been in circulation during the past three weeks. I think it may now interest you to have the following s- (1) A note giving the chronological sequence of events. (2) Extracts from Reuters telegrams during the past three weeks on this subject. (3) A printed letter dated 6th December 1932 from the Company to the Stockholders. (4) Copies of four articles that appeared in 'The Times' of England, two dated the 7th December and two dated the 9th Dec. 1932. There is no necessity for me to comment on the British Government notes as I have little doubt that you have more information about them than I have. The Company's view takes the form of an historical state ment of events during the past ten years which is a convincing ansv/er to the accusation by the Persian Government that the Company has been unwilling by friendly negotiations to endeavour to meet the views and the needs of the Persian Government. In this connection I would draw particular attention to 'The Times' article of the 7th December 1932 (marked with a X ) which, again, is a well reasoned statement of facts by a disinterested party in support of the opinion expressed in the article that in law and in equity the Companyts case is unassailable•(2) It is gratifying to note from the Persian Foreign Ministers statement to the Majliss (see the chronological note) that there is a definite indica tion that the Persian Government are now adopting a more conciliatory tone and have no other intention than to reach an equitable working basis with the Company. There is therefore every reason to be optimistic that the Company will emerge from the present impasse, so inconsiderately thrust upon them, with enhanced prestige and with a satisfactory basis of working which will take full cognisance of the enormous benefits derived by Persia from the Company 1 s operations, I am taking the liberty of sending a copy of this letter with the enclosures to the Political Agent, Bahrein, as I am sure that he also will be interested to have this information^ We have also sent the same docket to our repre sentative in Kuwait with the request that he would show it to Col. Dickson and, with the concurrence of the latter translate to His Excellency the Shaikh and other notables in Kuwait the items of main interest; as you will appreciate we are somev/hat disturbed at the possibility of propaganda against the Company by the opposition in Kuwait which may have been created by the present situation. » Our operations here throughout this period have continued in a perfectly normal manner and there has been no interference of any kind with our work nor any incident of an untoward nature. The Provincial Officials have treated us with every courtesyand our contact with them has been as cordial as it always has been in the past. With kind regards Yours sincerely End Lieut. Col. T.C.W. Fowle, C.B.E., Bus hi re.MUL O- P^RGIAK OIL COMPLY . SITUATION IN PERSIA, A brief chronology of events is as follows. On the 27th November 1932 the Persian Ciovernraent notified the Company of the annuIment of the Company's Concession. On the 28th November the Company replied that they could not recognise the right claimed by the Persian Government to cancel the Concession either in law or in equity find requested the Persian Government to withdraw the cancellation. On the 1st December the Persian Government replied to the Company declining to withdraw the cancellation. The full text of these letters is Pfiven in the Company's announcement dated 6th December 1932 addressed to the Stockholders of the Company. On the 2nd December the British Government addressed a note to the Persian Government which was delivered to the Persian Government on the same date by the British Minister in Tehran. On the 3rd December the Persian Government replied to this note in a note which was received by the British Government on the 5th December. On the 9th December a second note was delivered to the Persian Government by the British Minister on behalf of the British Government. The terms of these notes are ^iven in one of the attached extracts from the 'Times' dated the 9th Dec. 1932. Subsequent notes have been exchanged between the two Governments, but their full text has not yet been published. The gist of them has however appeared in Keuters and is briefly this. On or about the 14th December the Persian Government in a second note replied to the British Government's second note in which they re-affirmed their decision not to withdrawthe cancellation of the Concession and stated that they did not consider the International Court at the Hague competent to examine the dispute• They declared their right to appeal to the League of Nations. On or about the same date the British Government replied agreeing that the dispute between the two Uovern- ments should be referred to the Council of the League of Nations instead of to the International Court at the Hague. At the same time the British Government requested the Secretary-iieneral of the League to place the subject on the agenda for an early hearing and provisional arrangements were made by the League to deal with the matter on Tuesday the 20th December. The British Government has presented its case to the League, but according to the latest Reuter messages the Persian Government have requested postponement on the grounds that they could not possibly have their representa tives in Geneva before the 26th of December. There the matter rests at present. Telegraphic information has been received from Tehran that the notes exchanged with the British Government were read in the Majliss by the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs on the 16th December and that the Persian Minister then addressed the Majliss in the following terms The Persian Government had cancelled the Concession because they considered firstly that it did not satisfy their legitimate interests and secondly that the terms were not observed by the Company* So long as the Concession remained, the Persian Government had felt it impossible to adjust their own position. They had therefore cancelled the Concei3sion but in so doing they ted no other intention except to reach a new working basis which would be equitable to both parties, he referred to foreign Press comments and alleged that they misrepresented the facts adding that the Company would receive Persian Government orotection as heretofore unless intentional damage was carried out by some one who might consider it(3) advantageous in the present situation to take such an action. He said that the Company must receive an equitable share in return for the capital invested and that Persia also must receive an equitable share as owners of the property. In conclusion he stated that the Persian Government bore no ill-feeling towards the British Uovemment nor enmity against the Company nor animosity towards foreigners and that ■i j the Persian Government would seek every means to obtain their own rights. 18t h Dec. 193 2.iuXTKAGTS 29tli Novr» 1932 Tehran. Persian Govt, officially notified Anglo-Persian Oil Co. of annulment of Darcy concession but were willing to consider fresh terms. Concession was granted for 60 years in 1901. 6th Deer# 193^ Action of Persian Government in cancelling Anglo-Persian Oil Company^ concession on November twentyseventh was subject of several questions in Parliament* Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Anthony Eden replylnp* said British Government was fully aware of all circumstances including fact that concession was definitely granted for period of sixty years from 1901 and contains no provision for cancellation. On December second British Minister Tehran under Instructions made strongest representations to Persian Government emphasising very serious view held by British Government and adding that while they still hoped matter might be amicably settled British Government would not hesitate in case of need to take all legitimate measures to protect their just and indisputable interests. Persian Government were at same time informed that British Government v/lll not tolerate any damage to Company's interests or interference with their premises or business activities in Persia* 7th Deer. 1932 British Govt, have now received Persian reply to recent note protesting against cancellation of Anglo-Persian Oil Concession. 8th Deer., I932 Commenting on action of Persian Govt, in annulling Barcy concession of Anglo-Persian Oil Company which is not subject of diplomatic exchanges between London and Tehran Times says ' In law and in equity Company's case is unassailable. Only power of cancellation cr ntained in Darcy concession expired nearly thirty years ago. Moreover concession provides for settlement by arbitration of disputes which have not proved amenable to negotiation and Persian Government has conse quently broken agreement both by cancelling concession and by failing to have recourse to arbitration. Its plea that it was not constitutionally bound by original concession is Invalidated by fact that concession was recognised and Royalty accepted by succession of Govts, both before and after establishment of constitutional regime. In equity Company can claim Its activities been of enormous benefit to Persia where it has spent millions in wages and purchases that it has done its utmost to preserve just balance between claims of its stockholders and those of Sha^s Govt, and finally that Persian Gocrt. shared none of risks Involved in explora tion of their oil resources f\irnished no part of capital required for their exploitation and owe their development and consequent enrichment of Persia to Company^ efforts' 1 . Meanwhile Company has refused recognise cancellation of concession Persian authorities have formally adhered to it in second note and dispute is now engaging serious attention of British Government. 9th Deer. 1932 Important statement was made in Commons by Undersecretary Foreign Affairs Anthony Kden reference to strong represen tations to Persian Government regarding their action in(2) cancelling Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession* Bden read text of note handed Persian foreign minister second December by British Minister Tehran which described Persian Governments action as inadmissible breach of terms of concession stated British government took most serious view of Persian Govern ments conduct and demanded immediate withdrav/al of notification issued to Company. Hope was expressed that Persian Govt, would be at pains to reach amicable settlement in direct negotiation with Company but British Government would not hesitate if necessity arose to take all legitimate measures to protect their just and indisputable interests. Note added British Government would not tolerate any damage to Company's interests or interference with their premises or business interests in Persia. Persian Governments reply dated third December maintained Persian government was v/ithin its rights withdraw not refused direct discussions with Company with view to negotiating new concession and declared Persian Government did not regard itself as responsible for any damage accruing to Company, As British Government regarded this reply as wholly unsatisfactory British Minister Tehran under their instructions today delivered further note text of which was also read to House. Note stated British Government were unable to admit validity of unilateral cancellation of concession. Such cancellation was confiscatory measure and clear breach of international law committed against British company and British Government felt obliged to take matters up in exercise of their rights to protect interests of their nationals. From outset British Government had been anxious that amicable settlement should br reached between Persian Government and Company but could not regard Persian reply as offering any satisfactory basis for such settlement. Note proceeds 'Should Persian government be unwilling to withdraw their notification of cancellation of concession within one week from date of present note that is thursday 15th December His Ma esty's government will have no alternative to referring dispute which has arisen between them and Persian Government in regard to legality of Persian governments action to permanent court of international justice at Hague as matter of urgency under optional clause. In so doing His Majesty's government would request court to indicate under article fortyone of statute provisional measures which ought to be taken to preserve their rights.' Note concludes 'His Majesty's government will hold Persian government directly responsible for any damage to Company's interests any interference with their premises or business activities in Persian or any failure to afford Company adequate protection and in event of any such damage occurring His Majesty's government may demand for Company's protection.' Further particulars regarding ^nglo-Persian Oil Company's D'Arcy concession were given in response to Commons question by undersecretary foreign affairs Anthony iiiden. He said concession was granted by Persian Government for sixty years from May 1901 and contained no provision which would now allow cancellation by either side. Only power of cancellation in concession was provision that if within two years concession- are e should not have formed first coup any to operate it concession should become null and void. That clause never came into operation since first exploitation Company was duly formed within prescribed period. Concession provided for annual payment to Persian Government of sixteen percent of annual nett profits of any companies formed to operate concession. Total sum paid to Persian Government in Royalties up to 31st December 1931 amounted to £.11,265,000. Present Government had 12th Deer. 1932(3) holdings of United Kingdom Government in Anglo-Persian Oil Company were 7^ million £♦! shares^ one thousand £»1 preference shares and £»99fOOO five percent debentures and total amount received by United Kingdom Government from Company in dividends and interest up to present time was £.9f977i344. 14th Deer. 193^ Tehran. Replying British Govts note Persian Government not withdrawing cancellation of Anglo-Persian Oil Company f s concession and does not consider Court of International Justice competent to examine dispute and declares right appeal League of Nations view pressure British Government. Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs Anthony Kden stated in Commons that in view of intimation contained in reply of Persian Government that they contemplated appeal to Council of League of Nations which would entitle Persian Government to require suspension of any proceedings Instituted before permanent court of International Justice British Govt, had decided not to pursue their demand for reference of case to permanent court but instead to refer matter to Council of League under article 15 of covenant. Telegram accordingly been despatched to Secretary General of League submitting' matter to Council. Geneva message states subject been placed on Agenda of present session of Council to be dealt with next week. 15th Deer., 1932 Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon left Geneva last nistot and arrived London by air this morning. Date of his return to Geneva not yet fixed. League Council on whose agenda Anglo- Persian dispute has been placed at instigation of British Government will it is expected meet on Tuesday to deal with case. 18th Deer., 1932 Geneva. British Govt, has presented its case to League re Anglo-Persian Oil dispute. It is understood it is thirty page document embracing whole dispute. This afternoon however persian Officials waited on new Secretary General Avenol to point out that Persia at this juncture could not possibly have her representatives in Geneva before Christmas.

To the Stockholders of A nglo -P ersian O il C ompany , L imited. D ear S ir (or M adam), In view of the publicity accorded to recent events in Persia affecting your Company and of the statements which have appeared in the Press by or on behalf of the Persian G-overnment, the Directors consider it advisable to inform you officially of those developments, with a summary of the events which preceded them. The following is the text, as cabled to the Board, of a communication delivered by the Persian Minister of Finance to the Company's Resident Director in Tehran dated 27th November, 1932 :— The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been repeatedly informed by the Persian Government that the D'Arcy Concession of 1901 does not protect the interests of the ersian Government and that it is necessary to place relations between the Imperial Persian Government and the Company on a new basis which will provide for the2 teal interests of Persia. The defects and short comings of the If A rcy Concession arid its disagreement witjh. Persian interests have heen repeatedly pointed out, afi of course the Persian Gov&amp;rtVment cannot legally and logically consider itself hpund tv the provisions of a con cession which was granted priojr to the establishment of a constitutional regime in vie^o of the manner in which such concession was obtained.g^d granted at that time. However, the Persian Government in the hope that the Company would take into consideration the needs of the time and the present position of Persia, and secure her interests in accordance with those needs, has so far refrained from exercising its rights to cancel the D'Arcy Concession. Unfortunately, in the face of the patient c displayed hy the Persian Government, the Company not only took no practical steps to protect the interests of Persia, hut the more the Company*s expansion increased the more Persian interests were endangered. Therefore the Persian Government has lost hope of achieving the object in view hy means of negotiations with 'the Com* puny, and therefore the only way to safeguard its rights is % a cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession, and this Ministry in accordance with the decision of the Persian Government has to notify you that as from this date it has cancelled the D'Arcy Concession and will consider it void. At the same time, as the Persian Government has no other intention except to saf eguard Persian interests, should the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he prepared con trary to the past to safeguard Persian interests, in accordance with the views of the Persian Government, on the hasis of equity and justice, with the necessatk % security for safeguarding those interests, the PersimJ Government will not4n principle refuse to grant a new concession to that Company.3 The cable received from the Resident Director stated that the cancellation of the Concession had been pub- ^ied in the evening papers in Tehran. On the 28th November the Resident Director in Tehran was instructed to reply to the above communica tion in the following sense — I have hy telegram submitted to the Directors of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in London the text of Your Excellency's letter dated 21th November. I am instructed respectfully to inform Your Excellency that the Company does not admit that the terms of the D Arcy Concession do not protect the interests of the Persian Government, nor do they admit that even if that were the case the Government has the right to cancel the Concession. I may remind Your Excellency that the validity of the D'Arcy Concession has been recognised by successive Persian Governments before and after the establishment of the Constitutional regime, not only by acceptance for many years of the royalty provided for therein but also in many other ways. You will understand that the Company cannot recognise the right claimed by the Persian Government to cancel the Agreement, such contention having no foundation either in law or in equity. I am instructed to remind Your Excellency that, relying upon the good faith of the Persian Government and the rights conferred upon the Company by the Concession, the Company has expended in Persia many millions of pounds sterling. The benefits received by the Persian Government from this expenditure cannot be ignored in considering whether ^ terms of the Concession are fair to the Government, nor can they be ignored in any discussions between the Government and the Company which are to be based on4 equity and justice. The Company takes the strongest exception to the statements in Your Excellency's letter that the Company has failed to take into considera^^, the needs of the time and the present position of uie Persian Government. The Company has at all times shown itself willing by friendly negotiations to endeavour to meet the views and the needs of the Persian Government, and so far as accord has not been reached the failure has certainly not been due to any want of effort or goodwill on the part of the Company. The Company must point out that the publication of the Government's announcement in the Press will have most damaging repercussions on the Company's business, and the Directors venture to hope that on further considera tion the Government will immediately withdraw this announcement. On the 1st December a cable was received from the Resident Director in Tehran stating that a reply in the following sense had been received to the Company's communication from the Minister of Finance:— In reply to your letter of 2^th November I deem it necessary to state that the Persian Government does not admit the statements and reasons as mentioned in the said letter and considers itself entitled with sufficient reasons to cancel the D'Arcy Concession and that it remains its final decision which has been communicated under this Ministry's letter of ttth November. It will be observed that the Persian Government does not suggest in the above communications that the Conv pany has failed to carry out the terms of the D'A|J| Concession, but that it bases its claim to cancel the Con cession by one-sided action on the ground that in the viewof the Persian Government the Concession is no longer fair to it. The Persian Government further alleges )at the Company has taken no practical steps to protect the interests of Persia. Even if this statement were well- founded, it would not justify the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the Concession as the Con cession contains no clause entitling the Persian Govern ment to cancel it in any such event, and, moreover, does not impose upon the Company any obligation such as that suggested by the Persian Government. In order that you may form your own conclusion as to the correctness of the Persian Government's conten tions, the following information is furnished :— The D'Arcy Concession was granted to the late Mr. D'Arcy in the year 1901 in due proper and legal form by the then Persian Government, the Concession being signed and sealed by His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia and by his Prime Minister, and counter- sealed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Mines, the signature of His Imperial Majesty being certified by the British Vice-Consul at Tehran. As is well known, Mr. D'Arcy and his associates spent some seven years prospecting the territory covered by the Concession and expended thereon some hundreds of thousands of pounds before the existence of oil in commercial quantities was proved. It was only by virtue of his persistence and energy and the capital that he provided, or persuaded other persons to provide, that the )l resources of the Persian Empire were eventually proved. The Persian Government was not asked to take, and, in fact, did not take any part of the risk involved6 and has at no time furnished any part of the capital required. The Anglo-Persian Oil Co., Ltd., was formed in year 1909 to acquire the D'Arcy Concession, and has since been recognised throughout by all successive Persian Governments as the owner of this Concession. The Concession provided that there was to be paid to the Persian Government annually a sum equal to 16 per cent, of the annual net profits of any Company or Companies that might be formed in accordance with the terms of the Concession to operate the same. This constituted the royalty reserved by the Concession. The only power of cancellation contained in the Con cession was a provision that if within two years from the date of the Concession the Concessionnaire should not have established the first Company to operate the Concession, the Concession should become null and void. That clause never came into operation, by reason of the formation of the First Exploitation Company in 1903, and, apart from that clause, there is no provision in the Concession entitling the Persian Government to cancel it. The D'Arcy Concession did not attempt to define the basis on which the annual net profits of any Company or Companies formed to exploit the Concession were to be arrived at in calculating the Persian Government royalty. It is obvious that the phrase ' net profits ' is open to various interpretations, and when, after some 15 years' work on the Concession, profits were fi^t derived from the Concession, questions soon arose betwel I the Company and the Persian Government as to the manner in which the ' net profits ' on which thePersian Government was to receive its 16 per cent, ought to be calculated. ) After lengthy but unfruitful negotiations the Per sian Government formally appointed, in August, 1920, the late Sir Sydney Armitage-Smith—then its Financial Adviser—as its Representative to adjust finally all questions in dispute between the Company and the Imperial Government of Persia, either by an amicable arrangement, or, if that were not possible, by arbitra tion. The Persian Government's Representative was assisted in his negotiations by a firm of eminent chartered accountants as well as by eminent lawyers in this country. A change of Ministry in Persia took place shortly after the appointment of the Government's Representa tive, and the new Ministry confirmed his authority to continue negotiations with the Company. The Company met the Persian Government's Repre sentative, both parties having the assistance of legal and accountancy advisers, and on the 22nd December, 1920, an agreement was signed on behalf of the Persian Govern ment and of the Company, setting out the basis upon which the Company's profits were to be calculated for the future in ascertaining the royalty to be paid to the Persian Government under the D'Arcy Concession. At the same time, a collateral agreement was signed between the Persian Government's Representative and the Chairman of the Company by which the Company f orced to pay to the Persian Government in final otlement of the outstanding questions between the Government and the Company a sum of £1,000,000 sterling.8 The Directors made these arrangements in face of advice received from eminent lawyers in this county that some of the claims of the Persian Government co^^ not be substantiated in law, but the Directors considered it desirable to act in a liberal spirit in an endeavour to foster amicable relations with the Persian Government. From 1920 till about 1928 the arrangements provided in the 1920 Agreement substantially served the purposes for which they were designed, and the royalties payable by the Company to the Persian Government in accordance with the D'Arcy Concession, as interpreted by the 1920 Agreement, were checked each year on behalf of the Persian Government by eminent chartered accountants in this country. Some differences of interpretation again arose, but most of them were from time to time adjusted between the accountants of the two parties, and the royalties were accepted by the Persian Government without prejudice to those differences which had not proved susceptible of adjustment by the accountants. In the year 1928, further discussions took place at the instance of a representative of the Persian Govern ment with the object of effecting a revision of the D'Arcy Concession. These discussions eventually culminated at the beginning of the year 1929 in a visit to Tehran by Sir John Cadman, the Chairman of the Company, accompanied by other Directors and officials of the Com pany and by the Company's legal and accountancy advisers. The negotiations in Tehran extended over a period of some two months. Although agreement was reached on most of the poii^ which were under discussion between the Persian Govern ment and the Company, there were certain points on9 which final agreement proved to be impossible, the main yiiestion being the nature and extent of the increased par- cipation which the Persian Government desired to receive. The Directors were of opinion that they could not in fairness to the stockholders accept the views put forward by the Persian Government on this point and eventually these discussions ended in the spring of 1930. In 1931 negotiations were again opened for a revision not of the whole of the D'Arcy Concession, but of the basis upon which the &lt;c net profits ' of the Company were to be ascertained for the purpose of calculating the royalty payable to the Persian Government. The Persian Government was dissatisfied with the working of the 1920 Agreement, and its representative went so far as to contend that that Agreement was not binding upon the Government, although it had been signed by their fully authorised representative and had been acted upon for some eight years without its validity being questioned. The Directors pointed out to the Persian Government representative that it was not possible for them to enter into new negotiations on the basis that the 1920 Agreement was not binding, but eventually the parties agreed to discuss the matter without prejudice to the contentions of either party on this point to see whether a new basis could be arrived at which would be satisfactory to both parties. Early in 1932 a preliminary Agreement was arrived ( )it between His Highness Teymourtache, Minister of Court, on behalf of the Persian Government, and Sir John Cadman, the Chairman of the Company, setting •out certain principles which had been agreed between10 them on this subject as the result of prolonged negotia tions. This preliminary royalty agreement was approve^ by the Council of Ministers in Tehran in February, 193l^P It was understood by both parties that this document was to be submitted to their respective lawyers and accountants, who would discuss and draw up a more formal agreement defining the manner in which the royalty payment to the Persian Government was to be calculated in the future, in order to avoid, if possible, further differences of opinion between the parties on this point. The formulation of so detailed an agreement, in conformity with principles already agreed, and its correct rendering in the French language which was to ' prevail,' was a task involving a considerable expenditure of time. The lawyers and accountants, as the result of some months' work, eventually produced a formal draft royalty agreement which, subject to certain modifications— mainly in favour of the Persian Government and included at the request of its representatives—gave effect in their opinion to the general principles which had been agreed between the Persian Government's Representative and the Chairman of the Company. This draft was initialled in London on behalf of the Company and by the Persian Government Representative, on the advice of their lawyers and accountants, and was transmitted to Tehran, where it arrived on the 29th May, 1932, for formal ratification by the Persian Government, which has not yet been accorded. It will be seen, therefore, that the Directors canno^^ be accused of having failed to treat seriously the views of the Persian Government, discussions initiated in the iI* for n year 1928 relative to the revision of the D'Arcy Conces sion having been carried on continuously to the spring « 1930, and further prolonged discussions relative to e assessment of royalty having been carried on before -and since . On the 3rd June 1932 the Company's accounts for the year 1931 had been completed and, as is customary, the provisional royalty figures thus ascertained were -cabled to Tehran. It should be noted that the figures for royalty in the published accounts are provisional as they eannot be absolutely determined at the relatively early date when the Company's accounts are published. Furthermore, under the terms of the 1920 Agreement, the Persian Government is entitled to examine the accounts and within an interval of six months to challenge any points in the statement of royalties with which it is not in agreement. Until the current year this procedure has been followed. On the 8th June the Resident Director reported that the Persian Government had protested regarding the .smallness of the provisional royalty figures for the year 1931 (£306,872 # as compared with £1,288,312 in 1930), and had requested that its representatives should have full facilities to examine the figures. This was at once agreed. These facilities have always existed and have ■consistently been exercised by the Persian Government representatives. At the same time it was also reported from Tehran ^that the Persian Government considered the initialled q ■♦N ote— ' Eoyalty ' includes royalty payable by the First Exploitation Company Ltd. £172,122, as well as £134,750 payable by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Ltd12 draft royalty agreement received on 29th May needed further interpretation and editing in more comprehensible language, and proposed that a legal representative of tl^^ Company should proceed as soon a® possible to Tehra!^ This was followed by a further request on the 8th June asking the Company to send authorised representatives together with experts to Tehran in order to explain the draft and to re-edit it. To this the Company replied that the new draft had been prepared by the legal and accountancy experts on both sides on the basis of the preliminary draft royalty agreement, and that almost all of the alterations made had been made at the request of the Persian Govern ment's advisers, that the Chairman and Directors were overwhelmed with important problems and that neither the legal nor the chief accountancy advisers of the Com pany could leave for Persia, and therefore suggested that the Persian Government should send its representatives to London for a full explanation, since in London the legal and accountancy advisers of both parties were available as well as all the necessary data. The Company added that it would assist them to know which clauses were not understood. To this request no reply was; received. Meanwhile the Resident Director in Tehran- took steps to have the French text of the agreement re- edited by the legal adviser of the Company in Tehran for the assistance of the Persian Government. On the 29th June the Persian Government refused to accept the royalty for 1931 payable to it under the- terms of the agreements as they then existed, and on the 7th July the Company learnt from Tehran that the draft royalty agreement was still under examination, but thai I tentative proposals to the Company on an entirely different basis were under consideration.13 It* Subsequent reports received from the Company's Resident Director in Tehran, who has been in constant pmmunication with the responsible Persian Ministers, nave been to the effect that a new set of proposals was being prepared by them for discussion with the Company. Sir John Cadman, the Chairman of the Company, on the 25th October, on the eve of his departure for America, where he still is, instructed by telegram the Company's Resident Director in Tehran to inform the Minister of Court that he was leaving for America and that he sincerely trusted that the new proposals which he under stood were being prepared by the Persian Government would be based on a full sense of realities and of equity as between the Persian Government and the Company, and that in that event the Minister of Court might rest assured that they would be given the most careful consideration by the Company. In reply to this communication the Resident Director was asked to inform the Chairman that the Persian Government's proposals, which were almost complete, were based on realities and were in consequence reason able—at least, it was added, in the opinion of the Persian Government. On the 16th November the Minister of Finance con firmed to the Resident Director that the Government's proposals were almost complete. These proposals have not been made by the Persian Government, and the next communication between the Company's Resident Director in Tehran and the Persian Government on this subject was contained in the Government's notification of the V^27th November, a few days later, as set forth at the commencement of this communication. # # # #fa 14 The Chairman of the Company, while in Tehran in 1929, in the course of the negotiations which then took place, warned the Persian Government's rep resent at iv^^ that he foresaw that conditions in the oil industry might change for the worse, but at that time the Persian Govern ment's representatives were unwilling to visualise the possibility of the profits of the Company being reduced, and therewith the Persian Government's royalties. The heavy fall in profits in 1931 suffered by the Com pany in common with all other large oil undertakings, of which the Persian Government's representatives had in 1931 and in 1932 been forewarned, was certainly most unfortunate, but it did not affect adversely the Persian Government alone, nor does it afford any justification for the claim of the Persian Government that it has the right to cancel the concession on the faith of which so much money and work has been expended. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the Board is and always has been desirous of settling all questions that arise between the Company and the Persian Govern ment in a fair and friendly manner and in the broadest possible spirit consistent with its duty to endeavour to preserve a fair and just equilibrium between the interests of the Persian Government and of the Stockholders of the Company, and it is believed that the information which has been given above would satisfy any impartial person that the suggestions made by the Persian Government to the contrary have no foundation. The Board do not wish to minimise the seriod I character of the action taken by the Persian Government, nor the grave nature of the difficulties with which, in 115 view of this action, the Company must inevitably be confronted in its efforts to reach a settlement on sound id equitable principles. The situation is one which demands most careful consideration of the steps to be taken, and the Board is anxious not to take any action or to make any avoidable announcement which will stand in the way of the ultimate prospects of reaching an amicable settlement. Yours faithfully, W. FEAS'ER, Deputy Chairman ./o 8 'THa TIMBS' - WEmrjSDAY 7th jaca/BKR '12, fHB ACT IQt? OF PKR3IA. . The important statement issued last night by the Board of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to its shareholders, ,he chief of whom is His Majesty's Government, throws abundant Light on the causes of the dispute between this great British mdertaking and the Government of the 3HAH. The Company, it lay be said by way of preface, was registered in 1909 to acquire md work an extensive oil concession in southern and Central »ersia, which had been granted eight years before to ' r.W.K# ) , Af?CY, aa enterprising New ^ealander, by the then Shah, IUsa FF 1R- The conditions of the original concession Included the payment of a royalty of 16 per cent on the net xrofits of any company that might be formed to work the concession, fhen, after seven years of expensive exploration, the oilfields irere discovered and the Company was formed, this arrangement ras maintained. In 1913 farther capital was needed; the British Shareholders were unwilling to provide it; and it seemed that the control might mss into for^i^n hands. Lord untiring advocacy of tha conversion of the British fleet from the use of coal to oil, and the report of a Royal Commission supporting his proposals, provided that adequate tupplies of oil fuel under British financial control were obtainable, decided Mr.ASQUITH'S Government to provide the idditional capital required on a scale that gave them a controllin 'inaneial interest in the Company, though they undertook that 'hey would not intervene in its commercial management. Their iction obtained the definite sanction of Parliament a week ifter this country entered the ar. Thenceforth the output &gt;f the 'ersian oilfields increased rapidly f and the royalty became an important item in the Persian revenue. )uestion*s soon arose between the Company and the Persian Government as ,0 che method of computing the net profits on which the royalty ras based. An agreement was reached in 1920, and was respected )efore and after the accession of the new SHAH. In 1928, lowever, the Persian Government su jested a revision of the joncession. The story of the ensuing negotiations is told in ;he Company^ statement. Here it need only be said that the &gt;ersians, after making a preliminary agreement with the Company larly this year, did not ratify the agreement. In June they 'efused to accept the royalt/ and demanded explanations of the unratified agreement; in the autumn, they informed the Company that they were preoarin • fresh proposals; on November 27 they rormally cancelled the concession, and at the same time informed pie Company that they would not'in principle* refuse to rant It a new concession. The brief communication in which the Persian Govt, announces the decision to the Company contains an enumeration father than an explanation of its reasons for cancelling the )* HCY concession. The Concession, it is said, 'does not protect' Persian interests; in spite of 'the patience displayed &gt;y the Persian ^Governments the Company has taken ff no practical steps to protectthese interests; the Persian Government las lost hope of achieving its ends by negotiation. It defends ;he cancellation of the concession on the questionable assumption ihat it is not bound by a concession granted f, prior to the Establishment of a constitutional re^time ,, - a phrase which sears a striking resemblance to the reason given by the Bolshevists ror their repudiation of the financial and political obligations the Tsarist Government, The real causes of the Persian Government's action are, no doubt, to be found in the rowth of an ardent nationalism - which in ersia, as in other Asiatic Jountries, tends to be hostile to foreign commercial or financial Interests, however beneficial they h^ve been to arsia - and in the disappointment of the Persian Government at the recent iecline of its royalty, although this has been due to the generaleconomic crisis which has diminished the Company's profit as it has diminished those of all other large oil undertakings. In law and in equity the Company's case is unassailable. The only power of cancellation contained in the D 1 Arcy concession expired nearly thirty years ago. Moreover the concession provides for the settlement by arbitration of disputes which have not proved amenable to negotiation, and the Persian Government has consequently broken the agreement both by cancelling the concession and by failing to have recourse to arbitration. Its plea that it was not constitutionally bound by the original concession is invalidated by the fact that the concession was recognized and the royalty accepted by a success- si on of Governments both before and after the establishment of the constitutional regime. In equity the Company can claim that its activities have been of enormous benefit to Persia, where it has spent millions in wages and purchase; that it has done its utmost to preserve a Just balance between the claims of its stockholders and those of the 3HAH 1 3 Government| and finally that the Persian Government shared none of the risks involved in the exploration of their oil resources, umished no part of the capital required f&gt;r their exploitation, and owe their development and the consequent enrichment of Persia to the Company^s efforts. Meanwhile the Company has refused to recognize the cancellation of the concession; the Persian authorities have formally adhered to it in a second note; and the dispute is now engaging the serious attention of HIS h AJSSTY'S GOV ■ On Monday Mr.LuM informed the House of Commons that the Government had made the 'strongest representations^ to the 3HAH 1 3 Government through their .inister at Tehran, and announced that they would take ?f ail legitimate measures to protect their just and indisputable interests'* in case of need. The British Government would in any case be justified in protecting the rights of a great British undertaking against' illegal and inequitable invasion by a foreign Government. The fact that as stockholders in the Company they are the trustees of the national holding of over £.7^000,000 in ix,s shares, and that the Persian Oilfields are the principal source of the fuel used by the «oyal Uavy, is an additional reason for their vigorous defence of an excellent case. At present, while the dispute is the subject of diplomatic negotiations between London and Tehran, it is unnecessary to enlarge on the implications of the Persian Governments decision. It is possible, and It is certainly to be hoped, that they have not yet fully realized the unfriendly nature of their action in so far as it threatens or may ultimately threaten an essential British interest.w THE TIMES H Wednesday, 7th Deer. 1932 « CITY HOTKS . A BETTER TOHB . THE ANGLO-PERSIAK CIRCULAR. The pound was steadier yesterday. It fluctuated between $ ^nd ^ 3.21^, and finished almost un changed on the day at ^ 3 # 20. The Gilt-edged market was better in tone, the prices of a number of the leading British Government securities advanced. Oil shares, which had been weak since the announcement of the Persian Government's violation of its contract with the Anglo-Persian Company, made a general recovery yesterday, thanks chiefly to the firm protest lodged by the British Government, last evening a circular signed by r. W. Fraser, the deputy-chairman, was Issued to the stockholders of the company summa rizing the events which preceded the annulment and concluding with a statement of the board's policy. The circular sets forth in a lucid and convincing manner the history of this unfortunate episode. The concession provided that the Persian Government, without risking any capital whatever in the enterprise, was to receive annually a sum equal to 16 percent of the annual net profits that might be made, and it was not until after 15 years' work, when profits were first derived from the concession, that the Government's shares was called into question, in 1920 an agreement was signed under which the Persian Government received a lump sum of £1,000,000 in final settlement of questions then outstanding, and the basis upon which the company's profits were in future to be calculated in ascertaining the royalty was defined. Persia, of course, must have gained far more indirectly from the employment of her people and from the company's expenditure than she gained directly by participation in the company's profits. The fall in the Royalty . The Government, however, appears to have been startled on bein^f informed last June that the provisional royalty for 1931 was only £306,872, comnared with £1,288,312 in 1930, although it had been warned by Sir John Caiman as long ago as 1929 that conditions in the oil industry might change for the worse, nlsappointment over the fall in the royalty accentuated by national hostility to concessions to foreigners, seems to be the reason for annuling the concession. The issue, therefore, is really a simole one - namely, whether a contract entered into with the Persian Government will be honoured if its anticipations are not fulfilled. Shareholders will appreciate the moderate and reasonable tone of the circular and will endorse the directors' view that they desire to settle the dispute with the Persian Government in a friendly manner consistent with their duty to preserve a fair and just equilibrium between the Persian Government and the proprietors of the company.\\\ ANGLO- i^RRSIAN OIL . THE HOYALTIES DISPUTE . COMPANY'S EFFOHTS FOR SSTTLKMEWT ,, The Persian Government's reply to the British Goveriiiaent 1 s protest against the annulment of the Angio-perslan oil Company's D 1 Arcy concession was delivered on Monday, it is understood to maintain that the Persian Government was fully justified in the annulment. In a communication to its stockholders(printed in full on page 9)the Anglo-persian Oil Company gives the text of correspondence between itself and the Persian Government about the annulment of the Concession; recounts attempts it has made on differ ent occasions since 192; to settle questions outstanding between the Persian Government and itself by negotiation; and expresses its determination 'to take no action which will stand in the way of the ultimate prospects of reaching an amicable settlement'. Recalling the early history of the Concession, the Company points out that Mr. O 'Arcy and his associates spent some seven years in orospecting, at heavy cost, before the existence of oil in commercial quantities was proved, and that the ersian Government took no part of the risk Involved and at no time provided any of the capital. Successive RecoRnitlons . Moreover, except for a clause, since become Inoperative, providing for the event of failure of the concessionnaire to work the Concession, 'there Is no provision in the concession entitling the Persian Government to cancel it'. The B*Arcy concession was granted in 1901, w in due proper and legal fomr, by the then ersian Government, and the nglo-Perslan Oil Company t which was formed in 1909 to acquire the Concession, 'has since been recognized throughout by all successive -ersian Governments, as the owner of this concession'. After some 15 year's work, when profits were first derived, 'questions arose between the company and the Persian Government as to the manner In which the net profits on which the Persian Government was to receive its 16 percent ought to be calculated'. After negotiation, agreements were signed In 1920 settling the question of the basis of the royalties, and providing for the payment by the company of £1,000,0 0 to the ersian Government in final settlement of outstanding questions. In 1928 further discussions were begun at the Instance of the Persian Government, for a revision of the Concession. Agreement was reached on most points, but on the ersian Government's desire for Increased participation in profits, and in 1931 negotiations were again opened for revision.2- 'reliminary Agreenent . Early in 1932 a preliminary royalty aprreement reached by the ersian Minister of the Court and Sir John Cadraan, chairraan of the Company. This agreement was drafted, initialed in London by representatives of the company wid the ersian Government, and sent to Teheran, it arrived there in May, but has not yet been ratified. vlllj 'It will be seen, therefore', the comnany adds, 'that the directors cannot be accused of having failed to treat seriously the view of the Persian Government* discussions initiated in the year 1928 relative to the revision of the T) , Arcy Concession having been carried on continuously to the spring of 1930, and further prolonged discussions relative to the assessment of royalty having been carried on before and since', Nevertheless in June last the 'ersian Government refused to accept the royalty for 1931 payable under the agreements then existing, and in July the company learned that tentative proposals on an entirely different basis from that of the draft royalty agreement were under the consideration of the Persian Government. There was a heavy fail in profits in 1931 i 0 ? which the Persian Government had several times been forewarned), but this, the company says, 'did not affect adversely the Persian Government alone, nor does it afford any t 1usti- fication for the claim of the .ersian Government that it has the right to cancel the Concession on the faith of which so much money and work has been expended'. REPLY T' BRITISH PROTEST , Teheran, Deer,6. The Persian Governments reply to the protest which the British Minister made on behalf of his Government on December 2 was delivered yesterday. It is understood that the Persia^ Note is similar In substance to the reply made to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on December 1. In that reply the ersian Government maintained that it was fully justified in annullng the concession, and declared that this was its final decision. The Shah, who, with the members of the cabinet, is attending a Turcoman race meeting in ' azanderan, is expected to return t Teheran next Sunday.H The Times' 9.12.32. NSW HOTS TO PERSIA RBFSREKCR TO THR HAX3UE COURT. Westminster, Thursday. Before a crowded House of Commons to-day Mr. Eden recounted the latest developments in the dispute between the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. and the Persian Govt., to which the British v Govt, is a party. The gist of his statement was that if the Persian Govt, did not withdraw by December 15 its cancellation of the company's concession, the British Govt, would refer the matter to the Court of International Justice as a matter of urgency, and would ask the Court what measures it could take to protect its interests pending a decision; that meanwhile it would hold the Persian Govt, respon sible for any damage to the company's interests and property, and that ii the Persian Govt, failed to give the company protection the British Govt, reserved the right to take such measures as were necessary to give such protection^ This statement was embodied in a Kote handed to the Persian Govt, to-day, and was the sequel to the reply of the Persian Govt, to the British Note of December 2 - a reply which Mr. Eden declared to be 'wholly unsatisfactory.« It refused to withdraw the cancellation of the concession, though it did not rule out the negotiation of a new agreement with the company; and it denied responsibility for any possible damage to the company's property. Mr. Eden roused loud cheers from the Govt's supporters for his unequivocal condemnation of the Persian policy of unilateral repu- alaiion of a contract end general cheers for his announcement that the matter would be referred to the Hague Court if the Persian Govt, did not withdraw its notice of cancellation. Lansbury, however, smelt war in the British Govt's reservation of the right to protect its nationals if the Persian d0 a0 l Ghallen S ed Eden and Mr. Baldwin to say whether this meant the use of armed force in certain circums tances, and when told that hypothetical questions could not be answered and that the Govt, must be guided by circumstances he tried to move the adjournment of the House. The speaker could not JPTf ? 1:0 Proceed, because he could not formulate a definite patter to discuss, and he finally subsided with a protest against an ^unfortunate statement.'

Mr. Sden^ statement to the House of Commons on Monday was issued by the British wireless News here on Tuesday; but its publi cation in the Persian newspapers was forbidden by the police. This morning, however, it was published by order of the Shah. THE ANGLO-PSRSIAN DISPUTE Mr. Hiden^s statement in the House of Commons yesterday marks a further stage in the development of the Anglo-Persian dispute. The Persian reply to the British protest against the unilateral cancellation of the D 'Arcy concession is thoroughly unsatisfactory. It is, in fact, no more than a repetition of the assertions made in previous communications to the Anglo-Persian Oil Co,; and it contains no argument to justify the confiscatory action which would deprive a British company of their title, legally acquired, and hitherto respected by a succession of Persian Governments. The British Govt, have consequently informed the Persian authorities that failing the withdrawal of the cancellation of the concession by December 15th they will refer the dispute to the Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague as a matter of urgency, and will request the Court to indicate what provisional measures should be taken to protect British rights. The importance of the example set by the British Goirt. is manifest. For the first time they have taken advantage of the Optional Clause - which they ratified less than three years ago - to refer a major international i dispute to an international court, Persia being a member of the League of Nations and also one of the powers that signed the origi nal Protocol constituting the Court, her Govt, and her Parliament cannot consistently - or prudently - object to the reference of this dispute to an international tribunal composed of distinguished . jurists judging without fear or favour. In this country public opinion will warmly approve the action contes^lated by Hie Majesty's government in defence of an important British interest. sl'o 9l(T 9 fttf •11 THE TIMES** - 9-12^-32 11^ ANGLOPERSIAN OIL DISPUTE , NEW BRITISH MOTE TQ TEHEHAK * CAPTAIN P,MACDONALD (Isle of Wight,U.) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether there had been any farther developments with regard to the Anglo-Persian Oil concession in Persia; and whether he had had any intimation that the Persian Government was prepared to reconsider its attitude. Mr. EDEN. Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs (Warwick and Leamington, U«) f said:- I informed the House, in reply to a question by the hon. and gallant member for East Lewi sham on December 5, that tfets his Majesty's Minister at Teheran had on December 2 made the strongest representations to the Persian Government on this subject* I am now in a position to read to the House the text of the Note which Mr. Hoare then handed to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Kote was as follows!- (1) His Majesty*s Government in the United Kingdom have taken cognizance of the terms of the letter addressed by the Minister of Finance to the Resident Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on November 27, His Majesty^ Government consider the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the company^ concession to be an inadmissible breach of its terms; they take a most serious view of the conduct of the Persian Government, and have instructed me to demand the immediate withdrawal of the notification issued to the company. (2) Furthermore, I am directed to state that, while His Majesty's Government still hope that the Persian Government will be at pains to reach an amicable settle ment in direct negotiation with the company, His Majesty^ Government will not hesitate, if the necessity arises, to take all legitimate measures to protect their just and indisputable interests. (3) Finally, I have the honour to state that His Majesty 1 s Government will not tolerate any damage to the company^ interests or interference with their premises or business activities in Persia. PERSIAN CLAIMS . The Persian Government replied to these representa tions in a Note dated December 3, received by His Majesty's Minister on the afternoon of December 5, which ran as follows5- In reply to your respected Note of December 2 I have the honour to state 1- (1) The Persian Government regards itself as within its rights in cancelling the D'Arcy concession and does not agree to withdraw the Note of the Minister of Finance to Mr. Jacks, the Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, announcing the cancellation of the concession. The Imperial Persian Government is of opinion that for some time past it has been entitled to take steps to cancel the D'Arcy concession and for a long time past the Persian Government has repeatedly pointed out the fact that the stipulations of the above mentioned concession are xsl not in accord with the legitimate interests of Persia, and that it has not been satisfied with the situation arising from the above mentioned concession and with the conduct of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; but, in the hope that the above mentioned company would(2) be prepared to amend their ways so as to satisfy the mind of the Government in the desired manner, it has waited in patience• (2J As the Minister of Finance has pointed out in the Note announcing the cancellation of the D'Arcy concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Persian Government has not refused to enter into direct discussions with the above mentioned company with a view to the negotiation of a new concession which would safeguard in an equitable manner the rights and interests of Persia5 hence the attainment of the desired result in this matter depends upon the good faith which the company shows in this respect# (3) In reply to paragraph 3 of your respected Note, I have the honour to state that the Persian Government does not regard itself as responsible for any damage accruing to the company, and responsi bility for any damage which the company may possibly suffer will rest on the company itself. A FURTHER KOTE # His MaJesty* s Government in the United Kingdom regarded this reply as wholly unsatisfactory - (cheers) - and Mis Majesty^ Minister at Teheran, under the instruc tions, has accordingly delivered to the Persian Government to-day a further Hote in the following terms 1- (1) His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have had under consideration your Excellency's Kote of December 3 replying to my Note of December 2 in regard to the Persian Government's cancellation of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company's concession. I have the honour to inform your Excellency that His Majesty's Government are unable to admit the validity of a unilateral cancel lation of this concession# Such a cancellation is a confiscatory measure and a clear breach of international law committed against a British company and His Majesty's Government feel obliged to take the matter up in the exercii -se of their rights to protect the interests of their nationals. His Majesty's Government have from the outset, as pointed out in my Note of December 2, and as repeated in the statement made by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons on December 5, been anxious that an amicable settlement m€iy be reached between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. His Majesty's Government cannot, however, regard the Persian Governments Note of December 3 as offering any satisfactory basis for such a settlement. As I explained on December 2, His Majesty's Government consider the action of the Persian Government in cancel ling the concession to be an inadmissible breach of the terms of that instrument, and have therefore requested the withdrawal of the notification to the company of November 27. Since the Persian Government in their reply adduce no argument which can be regarded as in any way justifying their action. His Majesty's Govern ment must reiterate their request. (2) Should the Persian Government be unwilling to withdraw their notification of the cancellation of the concession within one week from the date of the present Note - i.e. Thursday, December 1?, His Majesty's Government will have no alternative to referring the(3) in dispute which has arisen between them and the Persian Government in regard to the legality of the Persian Government's action to the permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague - (cheers) - as a matter of urgency under the Optional Clause. In so doing His Majesty's Government would request the Court to indicate, under Article 41 of the Statute, the provisional measures which ought to be taken to preserve their rights, (3) Further, I am instructed to state that my Government do not accept the attitude outlined in paragraph 3 your Hote to the effect that the Persian Government cannot regard themselves as res ponsible for any damage accruing to the company. On the contrary, I have the honour to inform your Excellency categorically that His Majesty*» Govern ment will hold the Persian Government directly res ponsible for any damage to the company*s interests, any interference with their premises or business activities in Persia, or any failure to afford the company adequate protection, and, in the event of any such damage occurring His Majesty* s Government will regard themselves as entitled to take all such measures as the situation may demand for the company's protection. {Cheers.)

[E 6842/3880/34] (IIEOMMl Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—{Received December 28.) (No. 525.) Tehran, December 9, 1932. AS I have reported by telegram I communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs yesterday morning the note contained in your telegram No. 135 of the 7th December informing the Persian Government that His Majesty's Government insisted on the withdrawal of the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession as a preliminary condition of further negotiations. (A copy of the note is enclosed for convenience of reference.) 2. My intention when I decided not to deliver the note myself was to emphasise the fact that there was no room for any further argument. However, it transpired that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, with the rest of the Cabinet, had accompanied the Shah to the Turkoman races, had been held up by a heavy fall of snow during the last two days. The acting oriental secretary, Mr. Trott, handed the note to Mirza Ghaffar Khan Jelal, the head of the English section of the Ministry, who promised to let me know as soon as the note was in his chief's hands. He telephoned in the evening that he had delivered it at about 5 o'clock 3. The British Official Wireless reporting the statement made in the House of Commons by Mr. Eden on the 5th December was not published until the evening of the 7th December, the editor of the Messager explaining when questioned that, having referred to the police for guidance, he was instructed not to publish it, pending, it must be presumed, a reference to higher authority which was not immediately available. Since then it has been reproduced in the Persian press on the majority of which it has had a sobering effect, the general tone being that as His Majesty's Government obviously, though wrongly, thought that they were upholding a legitimate British right, it was only natural and hardly alarming that they should take the view formulated in Mr. Eden's statement. With regard to the general public, I am told, though I cannot vouch for the statement, that there is already a sense of apprehension and a fear of untoward consequences. 4. In diplomatic and European circles generally there is naturally an eager hope that the Persian Government have at long last definitely and hopelessly over reached themselves and are about to be brought to book. As an instance of the general feeling I will record that the Belgian Minister, M. Paternotte de la Vaillee, who only presented his letters of credence on the 27th November came to tell me that in conjunction with the Belgian experts he had been discussing with the Persian Government the electrical concession which was regarded as M. Cuvelier's 'leaving present.' The Persian Government were showing a most accommodating spirit and had, in fact, yielded on practically every point raised by the Belgians. He felt, however, and the representatives of the Belgian company agreed with him, that in view of the action taken by the Persian Government in respect of the D'Arcy Concession, it would be folly for a foreign company to invest money in Persia. He would, in all probability, advise his Government in this sense and urge, in the interests of occidental solidarity, that the Persian Government be plainly informed of the reasons for the withdrawal of the Belgian company from the field. He enquired whether much a course, if approved by his Government, would be welcomed by us, and I told him that in my opinion it would be a most suitable one. 5. Though I do so with some diffidence, I think it may possibly be of future, though clearly not of immediate, use to summarise forthwith the considerations which inclined me to show the Persian Government a way of escape from the painful necessity of choosing between an ignominious retreat, the certainty of an equally damaging judgment by the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague and an actual conflict. [663 ee—1]2 6. The paramount consideration is, of course, the fact that the Government hardly counts at all, and that what little 1 know of the Shah is not derived from personal contact. 7. As my despatches have shown for some time past, dissatisfaction is incrrasing at an alarming rate; the malcontents assert that the only thing that prevents dissatisfaction from manifesting itself in open rebellion is the deep- seated belief that the present regime is whole-heartedly supported by His Majesty's Government without whose previous consent no important step is taken. The existence of this otherwise incredible belief is abundantly confirmed by the fact that the first and unquestioning reaction of the general public, including one member of the Cabinet, to the news of the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession was that the whole thing was simply a put-up job betwen the Government and the company in order to render the extension of the concession and an increase in the Persian Government's share in the profits acceptable to the Majlis and shareholders respectively. 8. This being the state of affairs, it is not unnatural to feel a little uneasy as to what will happen when it is generally realised that a detested regime has issued an outrageous challenge to His Majesty's Government and that the challenge has been taken up. 9. Again, it is impossible to feel entirely confident that the Shah^s political acuteness has not been finally blunted by the enjoyment over seven years of a gradually increasing and now absolute despotism. Ugly stories of his violence circulate with increasing frequency, the latest being that he marched into Diba's room at the Palace in order personally to dismiss him (see my despatch No. 508 of the 2nd December). Not finding him His Majesty vented his displeasure on the furniture. In these circumstances it is natural to have in mind the observation once made to me by a profound student* of affairs that no man can for long support the mental strain imposed by unlimited and unquestioned power, and therefore to wonder whether the Shah will realise that a swift retreat is the only issue from the untenable position into which he has recklessly thrust himself. 10. Finally, the Soviet Government may welcome the opportunity of fishing in troubled waters, without running any great risk. 11. The fact, however, that I have recorded these forebodings which at a distance must appear unreal, does not mean that I do not fully realise that the present incident may very properly be considered as the sort of case which must be dealt with strictly on its merits without regard for events which may possibly ensue, as the result of the dramatic shattering of one of the bases of the Shah's strength or in consequence of an outburst of Imperial rage. 12. In a brilliant passage at the end of Turkey in Europe, 'Ulysses' wrote of Turkey as a sword with a contempt for all that can be cut and how the blunting of the sword had turned its contempt into stupidity. I trust that Sir Charles Eliot will not turn in his grave at a brutal bowdlerisation if I say that the general impression of the Shah is that he is a boot with a contempt for all that can be kicked, and express the hope that he can still distinguish between what can be kicked with impunity and enjoyment and a hard and unyielding surface. I fancy that most Persians would reassure me on this point. 13. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 249), the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No. 213) and His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 120).

Sir, Tehran, December 17, 1932. WITH reference to my despatch No. 532 of the 14th December, enclosing the full text of the Persian note of the 12th December about the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a record of a statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at a special session of the Majlis, held on Thursday, the 15th December, together with a record of some of the other speeches. No motion was placed before the House, and no vote taken. 2. There is nothing of note in Feroughi's statement, beyond what appears to be an assurance, given in language as unqualified as the circumstances would permit, that no interference in the company's operations was intended. The general tone, like that of the more recent press utterances, is less assertive and on the whole more conciliatory than the comments of a week ago. It is at least admitted that ' equity ' should apply to the company as well as the Government. 3. There has been no time before the departure of the bag to gain any idea of the impression upon the Persian Government and press of the news that His Majesty's Government have taken the question to the League of Nations instead of the Permanent Court. But it may be of interest to record that the immediate reaction of one or two intelligent Persians was to regard a reference to Geneva as a less severe step than a reference to The Hague. 4. The only newspaper comment so far available is a short comment in the Shafaq-i-Surkh on the British official news, stating that His Majesty's Govern ment had decided to refer the issue to the Council of the League of Nations. The Shafaq-i-Surkh remarks that Eeuter's correspondent appears to have made a mistake in the above news, because in their note the Persian Government expressed the view that a reference to the League of Nations would become necessary if and when the British Government made themselves an obstacle to the progress of discussions between the company and the Persian Government and brought coercion to bear against the latter. Otherwise the Persian Government consider this controversy to be definitely an ordinary internal matter between a business company and themselves, which should be solved according to the ordinary laws of Persia. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 263), the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire (No. 222), His Majesty's consul at Ahwaz (No. 99), and to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 131). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. Record of a Statement hy M. Feroughi. HIS Highness Feroughi read in the Majlis the text of notes exchanged with the British Government on the subject of cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession, after which he made the following statement:— The trend of events has so far been as reported. The honourable Deputies are quite well aware—and the contents of the notes also make it clear—why the Persian Government has cancelled the D'Arcy Concession. Briefly, it had two reasons : One was that, in principle, it was not satisfied with the Concession [691 b—1]because it did not agree with our legitimate interests. The other was that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have not complied with the terms of this same Concession and therefore it was loss heaped on loss for the Government. At last the Persian Government came to the conclusion that as long as it considered the D'Arcy Concession as valid, it would not succeed in ameliorating the position. For these reasons it cancelled the Concession, but it had no other intention in doing so than to place its relations with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on a sound basis, which would safeguard the interests of both parties equitably. It was due to this consideration that in the letter addressed by the Minister of Finance to the representative of the said company in respect of cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession it was pointed out that the Government was prepared to enter into negotiations with the company for the conclusion of a new Concession. We were hopeful that at last the company, for the sake of meeting the views of the Persian Government and the nation, would be prepared to accede to our request. Unfortunately our expectation has not yet been fulfilled and the inter ference of the British Government and the notes which I have read to the honourable Deputies have prevented the Government from beginning negotiations with the company in order to arrive at a satisfactory solution to this question. ' One thing more has been noticed which has added to our regret, and that is the misrepresentations which are being made in the British and foreign press. People are picturing the action of the Persian Government, its words and its deeds as contrary to truth, and they represent that this action of the Persian Government has been taken under other influences. Some have declared the Persian Government as possessing anti-foreign feelings, and stated that the cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession has arisen from that fact. Others speak of disturbances in districts where the oil industry is situated and talk of inter ferences therewith, thus creating disturbance in the public mind; while everybody knows that in these days and at the present time perfect security and safety exists throughout Persia, especially in the districts where the oil industry is situated. In regard to foreigners also, no one has shown any animosity against nor interference with them. ' The Persian Government has not interfered or committed any aggression in regard to the oil industry and, as heretofore, considers the said industry as being included in its protection. It has, in addition, as a safety measure, increased its protectionary measures, and it is certain that no damage will be done to the company and its organisation in Persia, unless someone may consider it to its own interest to intentionally cause damage thereto. 'Finally, the only intention of the Persian Government is to protect its own rights and interests. The Government says that this oil and its derivatives, which are produced in Persia, are the property of the Persian nation and that the nation should benefit from it in proportion to its right of ownership. What has been paid up to the present is insufficient, and its acceptance would create a bad name for the Government. If there was a day when Persians Or their rulers were negligent or corrupt and gave away this national source of wealth in a deceitful transaction—and even if within the limits of the same transaction they did not provide for the safeguarding of the country's interests—there is no reason why the same method and procedure should be continued to-day, when all eyes have been opened. Of course the company, which has invested and employed its financial and technical capital in this source of wealth, should benefit equitably from it, but it is not just that the nation which owns this wealth should be deprived of its just share and taken advantage of. This is our justifiable statement, which we have repeatedly said and written, and which we will continue to say as long as our rights are not provided for. ' Apart from this fact, the Persian Government has no ill will for the British Government nor has it any enmity for the company or opposition to any foreigners.

The reason why there 1m 60 cpiea of this f ir^an In the Liuty of finance is that ^oma people had similes erased the latter part of the sc^.e finaan and had forged the fao Mra into flriaana purporting to the transfer to themeelTee of Qrown imds.

Vhiu is one of the reasons which can prove that the transaction waa invalid. Reference to the text of the concealion will chow the extentof the loss* of the Govt. Can It be imgined that the whole oil mines of the country with the exception of those in five prorixw^e be ceded in concession without raa^ing epecial twm term© for the superTieton arid inspection of the activltes and the expenditures by the QoTt? Ihe transaction is really one of deceit.

The oil mines W' 1 ' of the o nntiy, ^ith the exception of those in 5 provinces, have and without an^ right of su- been ceded In concession and unconditionally tex^texteiapsit?: 4A perviaDn to the Ootapany against the payiiicat of any arbitrary their sum which they may like to call the 16} of xehk net Income. non- Another point \¥hich I wanted to raise in the fulfilment of one's lack of obligations and the respect due to tb provisions an^ delinqu- ency in the payrnent of the other party*s rights, xvhich bring abcnt right of cacellation of the contract in accordance with all jurisaictl ons of tbe \?orld. I conclude a transaction with you and do not fulfill the terms of that transaction; this evidently gives yon ri^ht to oancell the transacticn. We have many other arguments to advance in support of the righteousness of this action of the Oovt. She accounts of the Company fnrfcieh us a further reason to this end. If yon refer to the c memlnJcile in the Mlntrof finance you will realise the 'with which difficulties and themthode under which the accounts 0? the Company were presented to us, I mean that they give us no account but fix ev ry year tha luip sum that they are willing to pay. In the year 1930 they ^ave us £1,300,000 and in I c J3i they ^ave us £300,000 (Mahdavi: If we e amine the former accounts we would see that the accounts of the former year are similar to those of the next year). How did our royaltites dwindle to this extent while we see that the oil output for the latter yearcxoeeflea that of the former r«ar by Tons I ,(X)C t OCttUr i&amp;ehti ^ rtf Mr Bahn«ma mentioned in their speeches formerly u point in this oonneotion whioh Impressed me mudh. l'hoy Ks^rxsbso: 8ai6 that there my have been a political design in not paying the real royalties to Persia in order Ism that Persia may have less foreign exchange whioh she oan employ for the purohase of certain necessary things, his conpled with the fact that the Persian Govt did not have any right for sttpervision of the accounts entitled Persia to caacell the concoesion. I wish to reiterate once more that um we have no ill-will a ainet the British Govt or the Company; we are only dernamlin^ onr legiti mate right. Another condition xtoac^adtrt of the concession violated by the Company was that It did not comply with the laws of the country (It ia correct). Xhe Income Tax was enacted by the* Hajlese but the A. P. 0. refused to pay this tax and did not obey the ersian law. ihe company did not even act according to the terras cf the concession. I want to mmtion another point here with which Brinee ^fcar the honourable member of the Honae is the more acquainted than the others. The corruption of the previous donrt led the Persian people towards the year 1324 of the lunar era to demand and obtain the present constitutioml regime. Ever since the start of this regime every party or association which carse into existence in the country had the cacellation of this concession amon^ its ideal programme (it is correct). I have printed forms with this point in them. There were many other items in the programme such as the abrogation of the capltu&amp;atofy rights of foreigners etc etc. m Article £4 of the fundamental Law of the Country reouires that all concessions should be passed by the I'ajl ess and I state it here in loud voice that the . ajlet^a not only did never recc^nisc this concession but it did oanoell thle ccnc^ssion ±nxtlrsyT.K&amp;T.Itsm two session before this (it is correct), vhere is another point which oarcurred to me just now.

Sir, Tehran, December 14, 1932. WITH reference to my telegrams Nos: 225 and 231 of the 12th and 13th December, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the note that I have received from the Persian Government in reply to my note of the 8th December about the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's Concession. 2. This note shows every sign of having been drafted in a great hurry, and one theory that I have heard advanced is that this was because the Shah, who had approved its general tenor at Babul, on his way back from the Turkoman races, had given orders thaj: the reply should reach me before he himself had returned to the capital. The note, in fact, reached me on Monday morning (the 12th December), and His Imperial Majesty arrived back that evening. 3. The note is in the handwriting, not of one of the usual munshis of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, but the head of the English section himself. The Persian style is said to resemble that of Teymourtache, though the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to me as if he had drafted it himself. Jelal, in his haste, wrote '' My dear Minister '' at the beginning of the note, but he has since explained that this was a slip on his part and that ' M. le Ministre ' is correct. It may be of some interest to record that the Persian note of the 3rd December was in a handwriting believed to be that of Ghaffari, the Under-Secretary. I am not clear what the Minister for Foreign Affairs expects to achieve by these precautions, as the contents of the notes seem to become common property in the town almost as soon as they have been despatched. The present one is published in all the newspapers to-day. 4. I have, at Feroughi's request, supplied him with a copy of the English translation, in order that he may send it to his Legation in London. His Highness has since told the oriental secretary that, before doing so, he has made one or two very minor alterations in the text, but that these do not alter the main purport of the note in any way. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 250), the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No. 216), the acting British consul, Ahwaz (No. 96), and to His- Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 128). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. (Translation.) Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Minister. M. le Ministre, December 12, 1932. IN reply to vour Excellency's note of the 8th December, which was in reply to my note of the 3rd December, I have the honour to state as follows : 1. The first sentence of your esteemed note concludes with the statement that the officials of the Persian Government have not advanced any argument which would justify their action in cancelling the D'Arcy Concession, and that His Britannic Majesty's Government must therefore reiterate their request for the withdrawal of the said cancellation. In reply to the sentence in question, I have to state that the Persian Government have repeatedly pointed out the grounds for their dissatisfaction at the oil company's behaviour, and did not, therefore, consider that it would be [663 ff—1] b'It 1 * u necessary to repeat the repeated statements. Should the Persian Government rts^ 11 fail to conclude a new and satisfactory agreement with the company, and find it necessary, with a vieAv to substantiating their right to cancel the D'Arcy Concession, to refer the case to the court, they (the Persian Government) will offer J One their arguments in detail; and it is to be regretted that the reluctance on the part yl)^ -of the officials of the Imperial Government to enter into controversy and dispute, |iat ^ in view of the goodwill they (the Persian Government) have had in the matter JijU (and this fact caused me not to give in my note in detail the reasons for the action Jtrt of the Government in cancelling the D'Arcy Concession) has been interpreted by Lently the officials of His Britannic Majesty's Government as showing that the Persian jjsfortl Government have nothing to justify the genuineness of their action. Even now, in order not to allow His Britannic Majesty's Government to think that the Imperial Government refuse to mention the reasons for the cancellation of the concession, I hereby enumerate them briefly :— In addition to the fact that the D'Arcy Concession has not in itself been drawn up in such a way as to be compatible with the interests of Persia, and that the legitimate rights of the country have been tampered with at the time of the grant of the same, the said concession was secured at a time when the interests and welfare of the country were not being taken into view at the time of granting such concessions, and when those who used to obtain these concessions took advantage of the ignorance of the authorities of fhat time. Furthermore, in securing those concessions, all sorts of threats and coercive measures were being imposed at those times in such a way that, as a result of these threats and coercive measures, the authority who granted a concession was not free to abstain from granting such concessions. Your Excellency and His Britannic Majesty's Government will admit that the world of to-day does not accord any validity to agreements and concessions which have been imposed in such a manner, and does not consider the same as binding. Apart from the defects mentioned above, the behaviour and activities of the oil company towards the Persian Government are not even compatible with (the terms of) the same unsatisfactory concession, and the company has always failed to respect the rights of the Persian Government in accordance with the same bad and invalid concession, and has thus brought about a situation leading to the suppression of the rights of the Persian Government. For instance, according to the D'Arcy Concession, the company has had to pay to the Persian Govern ment 16 per cent, of all its income, as well as of all the income of the other subsidiary companies without any exception. The logical result of this under- ^kmg should have the right of superintending the expenditure, the amount of which should be deducted from the company's income before reaching the net profits, as well as the right of expressing their views in regard to the necessity or otherwise of the said expenditure. Otherwise, the revenues of Persia would always be exposed to the danger of diminution and decrease. But, unfortunately, the oil company, which is noted for its prodigality and extravagance, has never agreed that the Persian Government should have the right of supervising the company s expenditure before the payment of the royalty. I need not say that most of the unnecessary expenditure which is made by the company produces a great effect on the royalty, and was causing the said revenues to fall to a ridiculous amount. Further, the company has hitherto never produced, either to the Persian government or to their representative, its detailed accounts, nor the vouchers for its expenditure, and that of all its subsidiary companies, so that the Persian * 1 1 t/ ^ ^ y kj Ks UJ.±CIj U U-LJ.* Government might be assured of getting their proper revenues. The company has also so far refused, m contravention with the explicit terms of the concession, to P^y share of the Persian Government from the income of all of its 1 • f • . r 1 — J-J-Ji^v^JLULC' VJ_L Cl/11 UJL 1 to subs'diary companies. It has even consented to accord to some of these companies n ponrmt lm P orta11 ^ finaudal help out of its income, and has brought the same into to w tU f' f ^ S thus deCTe ? sed the Persian Govlrnmenfs income ' The company has consequently proved that it is in aSZme'' 0f th ° '™ 0n ' ' d l » , ™» d '-&lt;!'•«« &gt;«- Should I wish to give you instances of the lack of sincerity on the part of the company in its dealings with the Persian Government, I should have toSSS. l-n ln-(&gt; im write at great length. If your Excellency cares to refer to the documents and reports submitted by various British experts, your mind will be enlightened with regard to the company's behaviour on various occasions on which the interests of Persia have been prejudiced. One of the proofs showing that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has not abided by the D'Arcy Concession consists of the fact that, notwithstanding the fact that during the Great War the price of oil and oil products was- constantly rising, and the demand for the same was increasing, and that Persian oil was being considered as an effective factor for the navy of the Allies, and that consequently the sale of Persian oil at the world price of oil entailed enormous profits for the company, yet the company, in contravention of the explicit terms of the concession, abstained from paying the Persian Government's royalty, and in practice rendered the concession invalid. And although the Persian Govern ment have repeatedly attempted to secure their rights and settle previous accounts, it is to be regretted that the steps taken by the Government have not led to a result which the Persian Government are prepared to accept. It is likewise known to your Excellency that, according to the D'Arcy Concession, the company did not enjoy any exemption from the taxes of thi&amp; country, with the exception of certain instances of customs exemption, and that the company was at the same time amenable and subject to all internal Persian laws. Although an income tax has come into force since the year 1309 in Persia, and although the company was bound to obey the laws of Persia, it has so far refused to pay its taxes, and has demonstrated its defiance of the laws of the country. There will certainly be no need for me to explain to your Excellency the present development and expansion of the company and its wealth. It is evident that all this wealth has been founded upon the capital resources of Persia. Never theless, if we compare the Persian Government's revenues on account of oil with those of the company itself, it will be established how far Persia has been deceived in this transaction, and how unjustly the revenues of the Imperial State have been exposed to waste, and how the oil company has at the present moment employed the riches extracted from this country in other parts of the world, and thus endangered the future prospects of Persian oil. Although the company derives enormous advantages out of the Persian oil wells, and the Persian people could rightly expect to get at a reasonable and cheap price the oil which they need for their industrial and transport purposes, the oil and the oil- products are being sold by the company in this country, even in the places from which they are actually extracted, at a price higher than that charged by other countries, and for this reason Persia's industrial needs are in difficulties. If we wished to cite another example of the indifference of the company to Persian interests, we should say that, although according to the D'Arcy Conces sion, the company had the right to extract oil from all parts of Persia with the exception of five provinces, and although the existence of oil all over the country cannot be doubted, and the mere fact that the company had the right in question necessitated that it should take advantage of that right, nevertheless, far from centralising its activities in Persia in order to increase its own exploitation and thereby increase the royalties accruing to the Persian Government, it on the one hand limited its exploitation in Persia, and on the other continually increased the sphere of its activities outside Persia. Notwithstanding all the above-mentioned violations, the Persian Government tried repeatedly to bring their relations with the company on a firm and seemly footing and to put an end to all these controversies. Unfortunately, none of the efforts of the Persian Government led to a practical result. The Persian Govern ment even expressed a desire last summer that the company should send its representative to Tehran in order that a definite agreement should be reached here, but the company refused to send its duly authorised representative, pleadins- the general crisis as an excuse. ' Hence, with the sort of treatment that the company has shown towards the Persian Government, whereby on the one hand it avoids paying the dues of the Gowrnment, and on the other it has not shown good faith for the amendment ot the loundations of the concession, how can His Majesty's Government consider as unwarrantable this action of the Imperial Government and consider themselves authorised to bring pressure on the Persian Government ? [663 ff 1] b 2 IMHMBB4 2. Under the above circumstances, as I intimated in my former note, the Persian Government consider themselves justified in cancelling the D'Arcy Concession, and they do not see any reason for the withdrawal of the cancellation. I am also to point out that the Persian Government have always respected their international obligations and have always endeavoured to formulate their actions on the basis of righteousness and justice. But in the meantime the Persian Government cannot in any way allow their unquestionable rights to be disregarded, or permit the interests of the country to be exposed to waste. As the Persian Government hope there exist in the present age listening ears in the world for reasonable and just pleas, they have therefore never refused, and in fact have always been ready, to set forth their difficulties and to expose to competent inter national courts violations of the rights of the country. In the present instance, as your Excellency, in the name of your Government and basing yourself on article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, alludes to a reference to that court, I deem it my duty to draw your Excellency's attention to the fact that, if the stipulations of the article referred to had placed the examination of such questions within the competence of that court, the Persian Government, of course, would not have hesitated at all to accept a reference to that court, but it appears that the Permanent Court of Justice is not competent for the examination of the differences which have arisen between the Persian Government and the company, because article 36 of the said statute designates the competence of that court in such a way, in all cases where reference to the Permanent Court is made on the basis of the ' optional clause,' that the circum stances of the present case do not correspond with them. 3. Your Excellency repeats in paragraph 3 of your note that you consider the Persian Government as responsible for the losses which the company may suffer. The Persian Governmeut cannot understand how, while, on the one hand, they have no participation whatever in the activities of the company and, on the other, they have not interfered, and do not interfere, with the affairs of the company, nor cause it any inconvenience, any responsibility can devolve on them; and it is on the above grounds that I have the honour to reiterate that the company itself is responsible for any losses which it may suffer. 4. Coming to the hints which always appear in your Excellency's notes to the necessity for coming to friendly terms with the company, I venture to invite your attention to the point that the Persian Government have never refused, and, in fact, do not now refuse, to conclude a new agreement safeguarding equitably the interests of both parties, and they have proved their good faith in this connexion already in practice; and the reason why the Persian Govern ment did not take measures, after the cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession, in order to interfere with the company's institutions and still hold for the time being to the same decision in the hope of attaining the desired result, is that my Government have hoped that the company, instead of entering into the sphere of disputes over principles and of judicial controversies, would not lose the opportunity to send its duly authorised representative to Tehran in order that he might enter forthwith into negotiations with the Persian Government with the view of concluding an agreement which would safeguard the legitimate interests of Persia. But in practice it appears unfortunately that His Majesty's Government are perhaps not in favour of such an agreement between the Persian Government and the company, because the threats and the intimidation that His Majesty's Government are bringing to bear on my Government, and the unaccept able demands that are put forward, prevent in practice both the Persian Govern ment and the company from taking a single step towards reaching a mutual agreement; and, although the British Legation has so far not interfered in the discussions between the Persian Government and the company, it has now become an obstacle between the two parties and has adopted an attitude which does away at once with any hope of success in the conclusion of a new agreement with the company; and the authorities (of the Persian Government) cannot but regret that, although His Majesty's Government are certainly aware of the deceptions practised on the Persian Government and of their losses, far from advising and encouraging the company to take advantage of the good faith of the Persian Government and to hasten to ameliorate their situation, are, on the contrary, encouraging the company to resist by the pressure that they bring to bear on the Persian Government.1^ The Persian Government consider this attitude of His Majesty's Government , i ail J incompatible with the spirit of uprightness and the desire for peace that f pttould prevail among friendly Powers and members of the League of Nations, 0 Siibd consider themselves within their rights in bringing to the notice of the Huncil of the League of Nations the threats and pressure which have been hWected against them.

He admitted that Persian Government had 'blundered but maintained that His Majesty's Government In the United Klngdorr: had misunder stood Intentions of Persian Government which as their Inaction showed were neither forcibly to dispossess Company nor to place Company In a position of Inferiority with a view to subsequent negotiations. Persian Govern ment's Intentions towards Company were essentially friend ly; rightly or wrongly It had thought cancellation was only means of bringing Company to face serious negotia tions. What was to be gained from proceedings at the Hague where Persian Government would of necessity produce any facts calculated to damage Company. isven If verdict were unfavourable to Persian Government Company would gain nothing and human nature being what It was Company's subsequent operations could not he expected to progress smoothly. His Majesty's Government In the United Kingdom had declared they did not recognise validity of cancellation. Why not leave It at that and allow negotiations to proceed. I Invited His Highness to look at recent events through our eyes. We knew Minister of Court had reached settlement on various points In London last winter and subsequent fate of that settlement, that Minister of Court had suggested two and a half million pounds should he minimum figure of royalty and that only/i ^ 2^ cnly atcut a v^eek before nctice of cancellation v^as received Minister of Finance had informed Mr*Jacks that he was ahout to make comprehensive proposals to Company. With these facts before them how could His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have any douht regarding: unfriendly intentions of Persian Government or countenance negotiations until letter of cancellation had 'been withdrawn.. He admitted a 'blunder why not rectify it if Intention*of Persian Government were not aggressivec His Highness in reply was quite definite that withdrawal was impossihle and that Persian Government would go to the Hau:ue if compelled 'but their earnest hope was that His Majesty Vs Government in the United Kingdom would not insist,. At close of conversation X told him that I was far from sure whether I had dene right in listening to him at all, Ke replied that it was as a friend of England that he had asked me to come and his friendly feelings were only justification for much of what Ire had said. I am quite convinced that Members of Persian Government would not hesitate to go to the Hague rather than face dangerous task of trying to persuade Shah tc withdraw cancellation. I do not see that the moral value of a crushing legal victory at the Hague knowledge of which would he kept as far as possible from Persian public) would outweigh serious prejudice to Company's work here which would result unless we are satisfied thatcshort ci formal withdrawal of cancellation} there are no means of safeguarding Gcmpany, In belief that Persian Government would eagerly embrace any compromise I submit following might meet the case.

You conveyed this, also as your opinion ; to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, stating that it would be necessary for the Persians to take the initiative, but that they would only do so as a result of direct instructions from Tehran, As, what I believed to be, a result of the above action an Officer of the Persian Navy called upon me on the morning of the 27th December to &lt;• sk in what way they could show respect to our Navy and ? as a start,whether they could exchange salutes as H.M .S. 'Hawkins' passed Mohammerah. I may say here that I heard unofficially but from what I believe to be a reliable source is Majesty's Consul for Khuzistan, A H W A Z.Ill source, that the Officer Commanding the Persian Navy had received a telegram from the Shai^s Chief of Staff to the effect that he to show every respect to the British Kavy and that he held him directly responsible for their entertainment while in Abadan.

Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—{Received December 30.) {No. 545. Very Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, December 19, 1932. IT is gradually becoming possible to hazard a fairly definite opinion on the subject of the circumstances leading up to the letter from the Minister of Finance of the 27th November to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company cancelling the D'Arcy Concession, and to state that it is almost certain that the Shah had not consulted any of his Ministers before imposing his decision on his Government. 2. My first impression, which was almost entirely based on speculation, was that the well-known rivalry between the Minister of Court and the Minister of Finance had been a considerable factor. I imagined that the Shah had taken Taqi Zadeh to task for the long delay in bringing the company to book, and had obtained from him under severe pressure an admission that he had not yet got his proposals into final form and was in some doubt as to how to proceed. This admission had provoked an angry outburst from the Shah, who threatened to take the matter out of the hands of the Minister of Finance and once again to entrust it to Teymourtache, who had at least obtained from the company last winter a promise of £1 million in settlement of various outstanding issues. Thereupon, Taqi Zadeh, perturbed lest the fulfilment of this threat should mean that his long-drawn struggle with Teymourtache result in final defeat, either proposed or acquiesced in the cancellation of the company's concession. 3. I made a record of this hypothesis on the 3rd December, but it was altogether too hypothetical to record officially. 4. The following information now given to the commercial secretary by Dr. Friedlieb (see paragraph 10 of my despatch No. 505) who has been in frequent ■contact with Teymourtache and other members of the Government in connexion with his business proposals, is, I think, as near as we shall get to the truth. I •cannot say how much of his story is based on actual statements made to him, but in this country statements are no guarantee of truth and the conjecture of a shrewd foreigner is as reliable as anything else. 5. On the 26th November Taqi Zadeh arrived at the Council of Ministers with draft proposals for communication to the company in his pocket. Immediately after he arrived, the Shah entered accompanied by Teymourtache. His Majesty promptly started abusing Taqi Zadeh for his inability to bring the company to their senses and gradually worked himself up into a passionate rage. After some hesitation, and in the absence of any sign of life from Teymourtache, Taqi Zadeh stammered out that the company alone were to blame for the failure of the negotiations, whereupon the Shah exclaimed that the only thing to do was to cancel the concession, and there and then proceeded to dictate to Taqi Zadeh a full outline of the letter to be communicated to Mr. Jacks. He then left the room. 6. Explanations ensued between Taqi Zadeh and Teymourtache, the former of whom had imagined that, as Teymourtache came into the room with the Shah, he was aware of the Shah's intentions and that Teymourtache had consented in order to discredit him, whereas Teymourtache, to whom the Shah had not in fact said a word regarding his intentions, had thought that the boot was on the other s leg. Thereupon Taqi Zadeh and Teymourtache proceeded to draft a further paragraph for inclusion in the letter, expressing the readiness of the Persian Government to embark on negotiations for a new concession. This passage was submitted to the Shah by Teymourtache, who, when the Shah refused to accept it, threatened to resign and eventually induced His Majesty to give way. 7. Partial corroboration of all this is furnished by the fact that we know from Mustapha Khan Fateh's conversation on the 2nd December with Taqi Zadeh (of which a record will have been supplied to you by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company) that Taqi Zadeh did not approve of the cancellation of the concession. [663 gg—2]We have also known for some time past how seriously the Shah was perturbed by the drop in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's royalty. Finally, I learnt some- days ago that during his visit to the south the Shah pressed Mr. Carroll strongly j to build the railway line from Salehabad to Burujird with the utmost despatch f and regardless of cost, saying, in order to emphasise his point, that he was pre- ^ pared to come and work himself as a navvy. Mr. Carroll accordingly went into ml the figures and reported that the cost would be approximately 60 million tomans and the time required four years, and so I have no difficulty in believing that His. Majesty, realising that the proceeds of the sugar and tea monopoly would be quite ^ inadequate, returued to Tehran determined to bring -the issue with the Anglo- ' Persian Oil Company to a head. 1 8. Mr. Wadsworth, of the American Legation, told me to-day that Dr. Friedlieb claimed to have been asked by Teymourtache in the course of the last day or two what he thought the intentions of the Persian Government had been. Dr. Friedlieb replied that he had rejected the theory of collusion (see my despatch No. 505) between the Government and the company, and had concluded toC()I1 that the Government's intention was to give the company an unmistakably clear intimation of the Government's determination to get down to serious negotiations. According to Dr. Friedlieb, Teymourtache accepted this as a generally correct interpretation, while adding that ' he would have phrased it differently.' 9. I imagine that something of this sort will, in due course, emerge, as the official Persian explanation of a misunderstanding which the Persians will be delighted to believe could not have arisen had the company treated the matter as ' i* a normal business issue and had His Majesty's Government, by their intervention, not rendered a settlement difficult. But even though some such result is lit, that inevitable, we may hope that for a short time the intervention of His Majesty's Sims in Government will be remembered. ije 10.

Circular B,No.l37. On 27th November the Resident Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Tehran received letter from Persian Minister of Finance intimating that the Persian Government had cancelled the Company's concession as from that date. Grounds given were that Company had taken no practical steps to protect the interests of Persia and that Persian Government had lort hope of achieving the object in view by negotiations with the Company, Letter concluded by stating that if contrary to their past attitude the Company were prepared to safeguard Persian interests in accordance with the views of the Persian Government that latter would not in principle refuse to grant a new concession to the Company, H,M,Minister at Tehran having reported this development, was instructed to address note immediately to Persian Government, informing them that we considered their action in cancelling the Company's concession to be an (Sent 7,0 p,m, 9th December, 1932) 1 inadmissible/1^ inadmissible breach of its terms that we took a most serious view of their conduct and must demand the immediate with- drawal of the notification issued to the Company; that while we still hoped that they would be at pains to reach an amicable settlement with the Company, we would not hesitate if the necessity arose to take all legitimate measures to protect our just and indisputable interests; and finally that we would not tolerate any damage to the Company's interests or interference with their premises or business activities in Persia. Note in this sense was delivered to Persian Government 2nd December, and reply was received 5th December (1) maintaining the view that the Persian Government were entirely within their ri^its in cancelling the concession and refusing to withdraw the notice of cancellation (2) pointing outthat the Persian Government had not refused to enter into direct discuseions with the Company with a view to the negotiation of a new concession which would safeguard Persian interests (3) stating that the Persian Government do not regard themselves as responsible for any damage accruing to the Company the responsibility for which will rest on the Company itrelf^ In view of the unsatisfactory character of this reply H # M # Minister at Tehran was instructed on 7th December to deliver further note to Persian Government reiterating our request for the immediate withdrawal of thdfiotice of cancellation and stating that failing withdrawal by midday 15th December we will have no alternative but to refer the dispute as to the legality of the Persian Government's action to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague as a matter of urgency under the Optional Clause* In so doing we would request the Court to indicate under/I I uMer Article 41 of the Statute the provisional measures which ought to be taken to preserve our rights# ILM.Minister was also instructed to inform Persian Government categorically that we will hold them directly responsible for any damage to the Company's interests, any interference with their premises etc., or any failure to afford the Company adequate protection, and that in the event of any such damage occurring we will regard ourselves as entitled to take all such measures as the situation may demand for the Company's protection.

Cadman^s actual language was that If Persian Minister were ahle to meet him with complete and plenary powers from Persian Government to negotiate in London and to conclude there new concession on the understanding that Anglo-Fersian Oil Company still had a concession and that in the event of such negotiations breaking down D'Arcy concession would still he valid Cadman would he prepared to enter into negotiations with Persian Minister always provided credentials referred to were complete and satisfactory and that His Majesty's Government were prepared to auprove Company opening such negotiations. 2. Persian Minister again called on Cadman December 19t and pressed him to- visit Tehran. Cadman is replying that, as Persian Minister is aware, subject has been since before Council of League at Geneva when President in his concluding remarks intimated that fact that it had been brought before Council did not preclude possibility of discussions between the two parties namely His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and Persian Government. If as Cadman trusted a satisfactory basis of continuance of negotiations between Persian Government and Anglo-Fersian Oil Company should be found he would be happy to discuss matter furthere 3 Above is present position so far as Company are cone ernedconcerned. Object of Gadman's last letter is to Indicate dispute Is now one between Persian Government and His J/Ejesty's Government and that negotiations can only be resumed on basis which will be satisfactory to His Majesty's Government, It has been framed however to avoid an/ posslbl Implication that British Legation stand In way of settlement On the other hand both His Majesty's Government and Gompang! consider that satisfactory basis for resumption of negotia tions is only likely to be arrived at by keeping question within orbit of League. It is important moreover that nothing should be said or done which might encourage Persian Government to think that they can play off Company against His Majesty's Government or that they can escape from proceedings at Geneva merely by opening direct negotiations with Company meanwhile. Any reopening of negotiations between Persian Government and Company at this stage on an uncertain basis or any apparent willingness on the part of Company to send representatives to Tehran in advance of next Council meeting would merely weaken position both of His K&amp;jesty's Government and of Company themselves when matter next comes before Council and render/ it easier fcr Persians to argue that action of His Jfejesty's Government in raising iratter under Article 15 of Covenant forms only obstacle to arrangement between themselves and Company. • 4, For these reasonsvwe consider proceedings should continue at Geneva in January and that negotiations in the meantime between Persian Government and Company are undesir able. On the other hand it is clear that if Company are to he able to continue their operations in Persia some agreeme satisfactory to both parties will eventually have to be arrivedarrived, at by direct negotiation. Such negotiation can however only take place with any hope of success on hasis that in fact D'Arcy concession is regarded as maintained pending conclusion of new agreement« In view of difficulty of getting Shah to approve formal withdrawal of cancellation we consider that establishing satisfactory hasis for direct negotiation seems to he adoption of some formula which will give Company necessary guarantee while sufficiently saving Persia ? s face. Adoption of such a formula should form a part of proceedings at Geneva and we douht whether agreement upon it is likely before meeting in January. Should Persian Government however show signs of desiring discussions with you with a view to finding a formula on these lines which does not involve any withdrawal from position which His M'Vjesty ^ Government in the United Kingdom have taken up there would he no objection to such a discussion with a view to (facilitating agreement at Geneva. Naturally we do not wish course of proceeding%at Geneva to be such as to render agreement more difficult. 5, You should bear above considerations in mind in any further conversations you may have with Persian Government on the subject reporting..immediately if they should pzt fprwa any proposal which might in your opinion offer satisfactory basis for a resumption of negotiations between Persian Government and Company under aegis of His Majesty's Govern ment, (N*Dc ,A,F S ,1 L»,H«Ms.,Maj • West abd D.S.3037, Telegram XX No. 244.,dated 27tli (recd .28tb )Decr .1932.

I asked Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday whether he could tell me reasons for Shah's action. He replied that though he had frequently observed In recent months that Shah's manner towards Talmourtcahe was uncertain he had not expected his dismissal and could not really account for it. Conversation then drifted to Anglo-Persian Oil Company and Minister for Porelpn Affairs informed me that Minister of Justice and late Minister at Paris would leave for Geneva in about a week. If only there had been time to send adequate instructions to Persian representative before meeting on December 19th he believed matter could have been settled at once. In the course of rambling conversation H.H. tried to convince me that for all practical purposes Persian Government bcfabstaining frorn^ any active measures against Company had admitted invalidity of cancellation of concession. When he urged that having resard to our long and worldwide experience of affairs we should be tolerant of Persia's blundering first steps in international arena I told him that Persia had so conducted herself as to convince many people that these blunderings were deliberate and provocative. He sadly observed that he had gathered as imch from English Press. I went on to say that nersonally I did not take so extreme a view but I did have it against Persian Government that they were incapable of dealing with any issue on its present2t present merits but viewed It In the light of conditions which had ceased to exist. His Majesty's Government In the United Kingdom had no desire to put Persian Government up against a wall as he had phrased It In a previous^ conversation hut if Persian Government Wanted a quick settlement hy agreement when League met It was for them to take Initiative and produce a formula to enable negotiations between Persian Government and Company to begin* I concluded by saying that a satisfactory formula might be difficult to evolve and far the simplest course would be to withdraw luckless letter of November 27th.. (Of this there can be no ouestion). Conversation strengthened my conviction that Minister for Foreign Affairs at any rate fully realises hopelessness cf legal and moral position in which Sheh has landed Persian Government who are quite Incapable of trying to extricate themselves partly in normal hatred of initiative aggravated by fear of lgncre(ing?) Shah and partly lest we simply profit by their attempt to render their case still worse. I submit that it would be in. consonance with general policy of His Majesty's Govern ment to help them. Arguments from practical aspect in favour of this course are well known and I will not develop them. I think it would be easy to get Minister for Foreign Affairs to say that he would be glad if I would give him my views as to how rratttrs could be settled by imnedlate agreement on January 23rd without formal withdrawal frll cancellation or pronouncement by League of Nations on its legality.

No. 1. 705) ^ ^ 0 ^ in ^ mon - — {Received December 9.) ^ r ' T -rj x ttu i Moscow, December 6, 1932. , ^ ^ honour to report that the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Uompany s concession has been recorded with considerable satisfaction by the boviet press. An extremely partial review of the history of the concession appeared m an article in the Izvestiya of the 2nd December. vt \ This article begins by observing that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, like the Standard Oil and Royal Dutch Shell ' forms one of the strongest props of international imperialism, and plays a large political and economic role in the system of the ^itish Empire, being closely linked up with the British General btan, and it adds that the history of the company presents a ' rare picture of colonial rapacity.' After describing the original terms of the D'Arcy Concession, it remarks that these terms were only 'conditionally ' carried out, and that the company emancipated itself from all central control, maintained its own armed forces, and finding that its political privileges were restricted after the war, attempted in 1924 to raise the local tribes against the Central Govern ment. The increase in production and in capitalisation of this 'giant of the present-day ' oil industry is recorded, and the article then observes that in spite of the company s vast income it attempted to reduce the royalties payable to the Persian Government by means of the ' virtuous practice of writing down ' capital and profits, and by reckoning its investments in Allied enterprises as part of its overhead expenditure. The company is then accused of having systematically infringed '' the subsequent agreement (the Armitage-Smith Agreement), which it was obliged to make after its first large scale conflict with the Persian Government in 1920. Notwithstanding the decrease in the company's production in the current year of 600,000 tons compared with the previous year, the Izvestiya suggests that its profits were employed in further investments so as to reduce the surplus available for the calculation of royalties payable to the Persian Government, and quotes the statement of the chairman of the company at the last general meeting to the effect that the ' previous year's working showed the exceptional financial strength of the company.' In these circumstances, it adds, the reduction in royalties provoked new criticism in the Persian press and demands for the annulment of the concession. 3. The concluding paragraph of this article, of which I enclose a translation, supports the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the concession, suggesting that^ its existence is incompatible with the Persian Constitution. It adds that the '' decision of the question does not lie within the scope of legal formulas, but depends upon the interplay of political forces,' and applauds the cancellation as an act of considerable courage ' that was only possible owing to the decline in the prestige of the British Empire. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c. ESMOND OVEY. m Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the Izvestiya of December 2, 1932. (Translation.) WHAT does the annulment by the Persian Government of D'Arcy's Concession really mean ? The telegraph agencies are already reporting that the English Government denies the possibility of annulling or re-examining the [663 i—1]2 concession, although this is provided for in the concession agreement. The Persian Government, on their side, have some very serious arguments of a political character in their brief case, and, in the first place, the fact that the Persian p ( Constitution esvecially provides for the iwpossiUlity of granting to foreigners any concessions in Persia or of concluding foreign loans without special decree of the Majlis. As is well known, the Persian Majlis never confirmed D Arcy * Concession, and from the point of view of the Persian Constitution the existence g, of the latter is more than doubtful. Bourgeois specialists m international law | will of course, find thousands of reasons to condemn the decision of the Persian Government annulling the D'Arcy Concession. It is absolutely clear that the j decision of this question does not lie within the scope of legal formulas but ji depends upon the interplay of political forces. Inasmuch as Persia is faced, m this question, not only by an oil concern of world-wide importance, but by one \j which has the backing of the political and military strength of the British Empire, the decision regarding the annulment of D'Arcy's Concession cannot but be regarded as an act of considerable courage. It became possible only for the reason that the British Empire, under the blow of the world economic crisis, has already ceased to play its former role in the affairs of the world Independently, whatever may be the results of negotiations which will take place m the near future the present Anglo-Persian conflict constitutes a serious threat to the colonial policy of England, and its echo in Eastern countries will undoubtedly contribute to the further widening of the fissures in the shaken foundations of ol the senile British Empire. fc 11 yc fc tk Fc to aa Pe fo Of 1 %1*1 ^ COPY SENT TO JW-wn P.Z.7751/32.

They are therefore anxious that difficulty which has arisen on the subject of D'Arcy concession - a difficulty 'which was in part due to misunderstanding ^ shall he sneedlly settled to the satisfaction of all concerned. I feel that such a settlement will he promoted if I explain that intention of Persian Government has not been as Hie Majesty's Government appear to have thought to dispossess the Anglo-Persian Oil Company| this is fully established by fact that standing instructions of various Depart ments of the Imperial Government that Company's operations shall be assisted by all proper means have not been modified in any way. The intention of Persian Government was rather to give a new direction to negotiations which have for some years past(wlthout leading to any final result) engaged the attention of Persian Government: and Company. The Persian Government have felt that this failure to reach an agreement may ^ well have been due to the fact that basis of discussion waswas the D'Arcy concession. That document may, at the time when neither actual wealth of the Persian oil fields was proved nor immense developments of the Oil industry were foreseen, have heen as precise a definition of relations between the Company and Government as it was possible to formulate. In the conditions political as well as economic that exist today the Persian Government feel that a new definition of relations between themselves and Company would he to their, mutual 'advantage and that this purpose can he most readily achieved hy negotiation of a new concession. The Persian Government are confident, having regard to views frankly expressed hy Company that a satisfactory agreement can he reached and they trust that in the light of explanations furnished ahove His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom will agree to removal of this Question from the Agenda of the Council of the League of Nations. Should hopes of Persian Government he disappointed and a direct settlement with Company prove unobtainable Persian Government will be glad to reach an agreement with His Majesty f s Government for the issue to be settled through Diplomatic channel, by arbitration or by whatever means appear best fitted to ensure success.

Minister,Tehran. (Repeated Government of Indie. No.l.) Your telegrams Nos, 244,247 and 24P . General situation as we see it is as follows His Majesty^s Government in the United Kingdom have two objects, one ultimate and one immediate. Ultimate object is conclusion of new Agreement between Persian Government and Company which will be sufficient ly satisfactory to both sides and enable Company to continue operations in Persia on basis of those amicable relations with Persian Government which are generally admitted to be essential to condition of successful continuance of its operations. Immediate ooject is * resumption cf negotiations between Governinent find Company with a view to conclusion of such Agreement such negotiations being conducted on basis which does not put Company at a disadvantage, I.e. on a basis of eQuality. 2 i it seems clear object of Persian Government in cancelling concession was not to turn Corrraany out of Persia but to place it in a position where it would be bound to accept Government's terms. This object has been for the moment defeated by action df His Majesty's Government in taking up the case.'Had Persian Government complied with our request to withdraw cfiiicellation negotiations could have been resumed between them and Company on basis of equality and His Majesty's Governpait in2. in the United Kingdom could have dropped out. As Persian Government refused however His Majesty^'s Government decided to try to attain their two objects 'by 'bringing matter before Council, 3, Immediate object can 'be perhaps achieved during coming Session of Council 'but it is only a step towards attainment of ultimate object which must involve detailed negotiations between Company and Persian Government and while these continue it is essential that shadow of Council should hang over proceedings. Otherwise we should lose advantage which we have gained by our action up to now and should .not ensure negotiations taking place on basis of equality. 4. Any proposal resulting in immediate removal of question from Agenda of Council would thus not suit our bock - see paragraphs 3 and 4 of my telegram No*150 Unless therefore Persians are prepared to withdraw cancellation and negotiate on basis that if no agree ment is reached concession will remain in full force case must remain on Agenda of Council until new Agreement is definitely concluded. 5m order to attain immediate object however formula will have to be found to enable negotiations to be resumed on basis of equality and there should be adequate opportunities of doing so at Geneva. We shall of course be perfectly willing to help Persians to get out of the mess by co-operating with them in trying to devise solution. If satisfactory foimula for resumption of negotiation could be found in discussion;, at Geneva Council proceedings might be adjourned ■nending negotiations. 5 You will see from above that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom could not accept idea3» idea cf putting an end to proceedings at Geneva now. Tin is would Involve throwing away advantages cf present position. We should moreover justify Persian contention that we had brought the case 'before the Council unneces sarily If after having dene so on the ground that It was likely tc lead to rupture we now agreed to it being removed from Agenda without having attained anything beyond expression of Persian willingness to negotiate with Company, Further having once taken case off Agenda in such circumstances we could iiot put it on agaim *1» I fear therefore formula you suggest would not meet present situation. But you will see decision that proceedings must continue dees net mean that we are unwilling to help Persians when time comes by trying to find formula which will sufficiently save their face while affording satisfactory basis cf resumption of negotiations.

Is it not a fret that objections to my formula are matter of form rather than of substence and that a little manipulation by draftsman versed in language procedure of which I am ignorant would remove objections which you indicate e,g, I intended that my con cluding words should in fact 'keep the shadow of Council hanging over proceedings ,, and I did not realise that if we agreed to 'removal of question from agenda 1 'those same words would not in case of need enable us to put it on again, 2, Y/ith regard to paragraph 6 of your telegram Persian contention is I think rather thnt rupture could only h&amp;ve been a possibility if Persian Government hod proceeded to give effect to cancellation by taking active measures to control hamper or dispossess Company and if His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom had taken corresponding measures to protect it but as they have publicly stated thrt they have no intention of interfering with Company's operations all possibility of breach is excluded. 3. Minister for Foreign Affairs has argued in discussions with me that this attitude constitutes virtual surrender- to views of His Majesty 's Government but at Geneva Persians tmy rather take the line that it renders interfeience of bet! Council and His Majesty's Government superfluous and from thrt line it would only shorten step to sulky stalemate i .e.

Even if it were deslratle for us to take the initiative in suggesting a formula - thougti objection to this still seems overwhelming - jrour foimuiu would amount to statement that D'Arcy Concession is no longer appropriate and cannot be taken as a basis for negotiations; that Company and Persian Government are accord ■ ingly to negotiate on a different basis and if they cannot reach agreement mattei is to be taken up again between two Governments.

IN a private talk which I had with King Feisal on the 6th December, His Majesty referred to the news of the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's Concession. He professed to be annoyed by the temerity of the Persian Government, and expressed the opinion that British influence in the Middle East would be seriously affected if the Persians were not made to recon sider their action. 2. His Majesty's remarks are, I think, symptomatic of the widespread interest which this event has evoked. The local Arabic press has given great prominence to the news of the Persian Government's challenge to what is realised to be one of our most vital interests, and the steps which His Majesty's Govern ment will take to deal with this situation will be watched with the closest attention in this country. 3.

I am to request that you will circulate copies of this memorandum urgently to the members of the Council. I am, &amp;c. ALEXANDER CADOGAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by His Majesty''s Government in the United Kingdom. THE circumstances which have given rise to the dispute between the Imperial Government of Persia and themselves, which His Majesty's Govern ment in the United Kingdom ha^ found it necessary to bring before the Council under article 15, are as follows :— 2. By an agreement signed at Tehran on the 28th May, 1901 (see annex),, the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia granted to William Knox D'Arcy, a British subject, a concession for the special and exclusive right to prospect for, exploit and sell oil and other substances within the whole territory of the Persian Empire, with the exception of five named provinces. The concession, which was signed by His Imperial Majesty the then reigning Shah of Persia, signed and sealed by his Prime Minister and counter- sealed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Mines, was granted for a period of sixtv years from the date of the agreement, i.e., up to May 1961. 3. Under the concession (article 9), the concessionnaire was authorised to constitute one or more companies for the exploitation of the coiKiession. Accordingly the ' First Exploitation Company,' a company constituted under the law of England, with its registered office in London, was registered on the 21st Mav 1903 and, oil having been first discovered m commercial quantities m the concession'area in 1908, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) a company constituted under the law of England, and having its registered office in London, was formed for the purpose of taking over the concession and assuming all the rights and obligations of the concessionnaire thereunder The Anglo-Persian Oil Company was registered on the 14th April, 1909 and the concession and all the rights and obligations ot the concessionnaire thereunder were duly transferred to it. Accordingly, the Anglo-Persian Oi Company is and has been since 1909 the holder of the concession granted m 1901, and has been recognised as such by all successive Persian Governments. oeen recog and his associates spent some seven years prospecting the territorv covered bv the concession, and expended thereon some hundreds of thousand of pounds before the existence of oil m commercial quantities was proved The Persian Government was not asked to take, and, in fact, did not take anv part of the risk involved in thus proving and developing the oi resources of Persia, and has at no time furnished any part of the capital required. [8026]) / I iffll I i ■In Ifi 2 5. Production of Persian oil on a commercial scale began in 1912, and, since then, the Company has conducted extensive operations in Persia under the concession. In accordance with article 10 of the concession, under which the Persian Government was to receive (in addition to certain sums in cash and shares, which have been duly paid), 16 per cent, on the annual net profits of any ■companies formed to work the concession, large sums have been paid to that Government by the Company. The sums paid to the Persian Government up to the 31st December, 1931, amount to over £11 million sterling^ 1 ) 6. The concession contains no provision for its termination before the end of the period of sixty years for which it was granted, except article 16, under which the concession was to become null and void if, within two years from the ■date of the concession, no company had been formed in accordance with its terms for the purpose of working it. The 'First Exploitation Company' having been duly formed, as stated above, within this period of two years, the provision in question ceased to have effect as from the date on which that Company was formed. 7. Under article 17 of the concession, any dispute or difference between the parties thereto in respect of its interpretation or the rights or responsibilities of one or the other of the parties therefrom resulting was to be submitted to the decision of three arbitrators, one appointed by each party, and one selected by the two arbitrators so appointed. The decision of the arbitrators, or of the third -arbitrator in the event of the two arbitrators appointed by the parties failing to agree, was to be final. 8. It is a matter of common knowledge that in the year 1914 His Majesty's Government, with the object of ensuring the oil supplies of the British navy, acquired a considerable interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which interest they still retain. This statement is made for the sake of completeness; His Majesty's Government are bringing the present dispute before the Council not in the capacity of shareholders in the Company, but as the Government of a State which has thought it necessary to take up the case of one of its nationals whose interests have been injured by acts contrary to international law committed hy another State. 9. While article 10 of the concession provided that there was to be paid to the Persian Government annually a sum equal to 16 per cent, of the annual net profits of any company or companies that might be formed in accordance with the terms of the concession to operate the same, it did not. attempt to define the basis on which the annual net profits of any such company were to be arrived at in calculating the Persian Government's royalty. It is obvious that the phrase '' net profits '' is open to various interpretations, and when, after some fifteen years' work on the concession, profits were first derived from it, questions soon arose between the Persian Government and the Company as to the manner in which the ' net profits ' on which the Persian Government was to receive its 16 per cent, ought to be calculated. That such questions should have arisen was not a matter for surprise, having regard, on the one hand, to the lack of precise definition within the body of the D'Arcy Concession Agreement, and, on the other, to the steady expansion in all directions of the Company's business relations and to the inevitably increasing complexity of its financial and accounting arrangements. 10. After lengthy but unfruitful negotiations, the Persian Government formally appointed, in August 1920, the late Sir Sydney Armitage-Smith—then its financial adviser—as its representative to adjust finally all questions in dispute between the Persian Government and the Company, either by an amicable arrangement, or, if that were not possible, by arbitration. The Persian Govern ment's representative was assisted in his negotiations by eminent firms of chartered accountants and of lawyers in Great Britain. 11. A change of Ministry in Persia took place shortly after the appointment of the Government's representative, and the new Ministry confirmed his authority to continue negotiations with the Company. ( 1 ) The amounts (to the nearest thousand pounds) of the royalties actually paid by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company to the Persian Government have been as follows; For the period 1913 to 1919, an aggregate sum of £1,326,000. For the years ending on the 31st March, 1920, £469,000; 1921, £585,000; 1922, £593,000; 1923, £533,000; 1924, £411,000; 1925, £831,000; 1928, : £1,054,000; 1927, £1,400,000; 1923, £502,000. For the nine months ending the 31st December, 1928, £529,000. For the years ending the 31st December, 1929, £1,437,000; 1930, £1,288,000, 1931, £307,000.12. The Company met the Persian Government's representative, both parties having the assistance of legal and accountancy advisers, and on the 22nd December, 1920, an agreement was signed on behalf of the Persian Govern ment and of the Company, setting out the basis upon which the Company's profits were to be calculated for the future in ascertaining the royalty to be paid to the Persian Government under article 10 of the D'Arcy Concession. At the same time, a collateral agreement was signed between the Persian Government's repre sentative and the chairman of the Company by which the Company agreed to pay to the Persian Government in final settlement of the outstanding questions between the Government and the Company a sum of £1 million sterling. This settlement covered all claims of the Persian Government in respect of unpaid royalties up to the 31st March, 1919. 13. Since that date the royalty to be paid to the Persian Government has been ascertained in accordance with the terms of this agreement. 14. From 1920 till about 1928 the arrangements provided in the 1920 agreement substantially served the purposes for which they were designed, and the royalties payable by the Company to the Persian Government in accordance with the D'Arcy Concession, as interpreted by the 1920 agreement, were checked each year on behalf of the Persian Government by eminent chartered accountants in Great Britain. Some differences of interpretation again arose, but most of them were from time to time adjusted between the accountants of the two parties,, and the royalties were accepted by the Persian Government without prejudice to those differences which had not proved susceptible of adjustment by the accountants. 15. In 1929 the Company's representatives went to Tehran, at the instance of the Persian Government, to conduct negotiations for a revision of the concession. These negotiations, however, did not result in an agreement. 16. In 1931 fresh negotiations were opened for a revision of the basis upon which the '' net profits'' of the Company were to be ascertained for the purpose of calculating the royalty payable to the Persian Government, and early in 1932 a preliminary agreement was arrived at between his Highness Teymourtache, Minister of Court, on behalf of the Persian Government, and Sir John Cadman, the chairman of the Company, setting out certain principles which had been agreed between them on this subject as the result of prolonged negotiations. This preliminary royalty agreement was approved by the Council of Ministers in Tehran in February 1932. , . n , , 17. It was understood by both parties that this document was to be submitted to their respective lawyers and accountants, who would discuss and draw up a more formal agreement defining the manner in which the royalty payment to the Persian Government was to be calculated in the future, in order to avoid if possible, further differences of opinion between the parties on this point. The formulation of so detailed an agreement, in conformity with principles already agreed, and its correct rendering in the French language, which was to ' prevail ' was a task involving a considerable expenditure of time. 18 The lawyers and accountants, as the result of some months work, eventually produced a formal draft royalty agreement which, subject to certain modifications—mainly in favour of the Persian Government and included at the request of its representative—gave effect, in their opinion, to the general principles which had been agreed between the Pers an Government s representa tive and the chairman of the Company. This draft was initialled m London on behalf of the Company and by the Persian Government s representative (Mirza Eissa Khan the Persian Imperial Commissioner appointed under article 11 ot the concession) on the advice of their lawyers and ™f„ a s n 2 ts ' fo a r n d Xt transmitted to Tehran, where it arrived on the 29th ^ 1932 for formal ratification by the Persian Government, which has not yet been accorded. 19 On the 3rd June, 1932, the Company s accounts for the year 1931 had Wn mrnnleted and as is customary, the provisional royalty figures thus ascertained were cabled to Tehran. It should be noted that the figures for royalty ?n the published accounts are provisional, as they cannot be absolutely determined at the relatively early date when the Company's accounts are published. Furthermore under the terms of the 1920 agreement, the Persian Government is entitled to examine the accounts and within an interval of six months to challenge any points in the statement of royalties with which it is not in agreement. Until [8026] B 2the current year this procedure has been followed, and the Persian Government has, in fact, regularly exercised this right. 20. On the 8th June the Resident Director reported that the Persian Government had protested regarding the smallness of the provisional royalty figures for the year 1931 (£306,872 as compared with £1,288,312 in 1930), and had requested that its representatives should have full facilities to examine the figures. This was at once agreed. These facilities have always existed and have consistently been exercised by the Persian Government representatives. Both the Minister of Court and the Finance Minister had been previously warned that, owing to the depression in the oil industry, the amount of the royalty for 1931 was bound to be far below that of earlier and more prosperous years. 21. About the same time the Persian Government informed the Company that it considered the initialled agreement, referred to in paragraph 18 above, which had been received on the 29th May, needed further interpretation and editing in more comprehensible language, and requested the Company to send authorised representatives and experts to Tehran in order to explain the draft and to re-edit it. The Company replied that it was impossible for the legal or chief accountancy advisers of the Company to go to Persia at the moment, and suggested that the Persian Government should send its representatives to London for a full explanation, since the legal and accountancy advisers of both parties were available there, as well as all the necessary data. Meanwhile steps were taken to have the French text of the agreement re-edited by the legal adviser of the Company in Tehran for the assistance of the Persian Government. 22. On the 29th June the Persian Government refused to accept the royalty for 1931 payable to it under the terms of the existing agreements, and on the 7th July the Company learnt from Tehran that the draft royalty agreement was still under examination, but that tentative proposals to the Company^ on an entirely different basis were under consideration. The Company's representative in Tehran was subsequently informed that the Persian Ministers concerned were preparing a new set of proposals for discussion with the Company, and on the 16th November the Minister of Finance informed the Company's representative in Tehran that these proposals were almost complete. No such proposals have, however, in fact, been communicated to the Company by the Persian Government. 23. At this stage, therefore, the situation was that, early in the present year, a preliminary agreement for modifying the existing 'basis (i.e., that resulting from the agreement of 1920) on which the royalty payable to the Persian Government was to be calculated had been arrived at between the Persian Government and the Company and had been approved by the Persian Council of Ministers; that the formal agreement, which was to give effect to this preliminary agreement, had been negotiated and initialled by representatives of the parties and had for some months been under consideration by the Persian Government. The Persian Government, who appeared to be dissatisfied with the proposed agreement, had not, in fact, made any alternative proposals to the Company, though it had informed the Company's representative at Tehran that such poposals were in course of preparation. The Company would have been perfectly prepared to consider such proposals on receiving them. Moreover, should it have ultimately proved impossible for the Persian Government and the Company to come to an agreement, any claims by the Government against the Company could, and should, have been submitted to arbitration in accordance with article 17 of the concession. 24. The Persian Government, however, preferred to adopt another course. On the 27th November, 1932, the Persian Minister of Finance delivered the following communication to the Resident Director in Tehran of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company( 2 ): — The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been repeatedly informed by the Persian Government that the D'Arcy Concession of 1901 does not protect the interests of the Persian Goovernment and that it is necessary to place relations between the Imperial Persian Government and the Company on a new basis which will provide for the real interests of Persia. The defects and shortcomings of the D'Arcy Concession and its disagree ment with Persian interests have been repeatedly pointed out, and, of course, - i eX ^ ^ all communications from the Persian Government quoted in this memorandum is the English translation as received in Iiondon by telegraph.1 I the Persian Government cannot legally and logically consider itself bound to the provisions of a concession which was granted prior to the establish ment of a constitutional regime in view of the manner in which such concession was obtained and granted at that time. However, the Persian Government, in the hope that the Company would take into consideration the needs of the time and the present position of Persia, and secure her interests in accordance with those needs, has so far refrained from exercising its rights to cancel the D'Arcy Concession. Unfortunately, in the face of the patience displayed by the Persian Government, the Company not only took no practical steps to protect the interests of Persia, but the more the Company's expansion increased the more Persian interests were endangered. Therefore, the Persian Government has lost hope of achieving the object in view by means of negotiations with the Company, and therefore the only way to safeguard its rights is by a cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession, and this Ministry, in accordance with the decision of the Persian Govern ment, has to notify you that as from this date it has cancelled the D'Arcy Concession and will consider it void. At the same time, as the Persian Government has no other intention except to safeguard Persian interests, should the Anglo-Persian Oil Company be prepared, contrary to the past, to safeguard Persian interests, in accordance with the views of the Persian Government, on the basis of equity and justice, with the necessary security for safeguarding those interests, the Persian Government will not, in principle, refuse to grant a new concession to that Company.' 25. On the 28th November, 1932, the resident director in Tehran of the Company sent the following reply to the above communication: — 'I have by telegram submitted to the directors of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in London the text of your Excellency's letter dated the 27th November. I am instructed respectfully to inform your Excellency that the Company does not admit that the terms of the D'Arcy Concession do not protect the interests of the Persian Government, nor do they admit that, even if that were the case, the Government has the right to cancel the concession. I may remind your Excellency that the validity of the D'Arcy Concession has been recognised by successive Persian Governments before and after the establishment of the constitutional regime, not only by acceptance for many years of the royalty provided for therein, but also in many other ways. You will understand that the Company cannot recognise the right claimed by the Persian Government to cancel the agreement, such contention having no foundation either in law or in equity. I am instructed to remind your Excellency that, relying upon the good faith of the Persian Government and the rights conferred upon the Company by the concession, the Company has expended in Persia many millions of pounds sterling. The benefits received by the Persian Government from this expenditure cannot be ignored in considering whether the terms of the concession are fair to the Government, nor can they be ignored in any discussions between the Government and the Company which are to be based on equity and justice. The Company takes the strongest exception to the statements m your Excellency's letter that the Company has failed to take into considera tion the needs of the time and the present position of the Persian Govern ment. The Company has at all times shown itself willing by friendly negotiations to endeavour to meet the views and the needs of the Persian Government, and so far as accord has not been reached the failure has certainly not been due to any want of effort or goodwill on the part of the Company The Company must point out that the publication of the Government announcement in the press will have most damaging reper cussions on the Company's business, and the directors venture to hope that on further consideration the Government will immediately withdraw this announcement.'' 26. On the 30th November or the 1st December, 1932, the Minister of Finance replied in the following terms : ' In reply to your letter of the 29th November, I deem it necessary to state that the Persian Government does not admit the statements and reasons as mentioned in the said letter, and considers itself entitled, with sufficienti i I 1 4 1 reasons, to cancel the D'Arcy Concession, and that it remains its final decision which has been communicated under this Ministry's letter of the 27th November.' ^ i 27 ' r 0R being informed of tllis situation by His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom thought it necessary to take up the case m exercise of their rights to protect a British national when injured by acts contrary to international law, committed by another State, and to ensure m the person of their nationals respect for the rules of international law Accordingly, on the 2nd December, 1932, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran presented the following note to the Persian Government:— '(1) His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have taken cognisance of the terms of the letter addressed by the Minister of Finance to St 6 !, I ^ s ^ en ^ director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the 27th November. His Majesty's Government consider the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the Company's concession to be an inadmissible breach of its terms; they take a most serious view of the conduct of the Persian Government, and have instructed me to demand the immediate withdrawal of the notification issued to the Company. '(2) Furthermore, I am directed to state that, while His Majesty's Government still hope that the Persian Government will be at pains to reach an amicable settlement in direct negotiation with the Company, His Majesty's Government will not hesitate, if the necessity arises, to take all legitimate measures to protect their just and indisputable interests. (3) Finally, I have the honour to state that His Majesty's Government will not tolerate any damage to the Company's interests or interference with their premises or business activities in Persia.' 28 On the 3rd December, 1932, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, replied to this note in the following terms :— ' In reply to your respected note of the 2nd December, I have the honour to state :— ' (1) The Persian Government regards itself as within its rights in C 2 I1 ^ e ^ ^ ^ ^ rc y Concession, and does not agree to withdraw the note ot the Minister of Finance to Mr. Jacks, the director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, announcing the cancellation of the concession. The Imperial Persian Government is of opinion that for some time past it has been entitled to take steps to cancel the D'Arcy Concession, and for a long time past the Persian Government has repeatedly pointed out the fact that the stipulations oi the above-mentioned concession are not in accord with the legitimate interests of Persia, and that it has not been satisfied with the situation arising trom the above-mentioned concession, and with the conduct of the Ando- Persian Oil Company; but, in the hope that the above-mentioned Company would be prepared to amend their ways so as to satisfy the mind of the Government m the desired manner, it has waited in patience. (2) x ^s the Minister of Finance has pointed out in the note announcing the cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Persian Government has not refused to enter into direct discussions with the above-mentioned Company, with a view to the negotiation of a new con cession which would safeguard in an equitable manner the rights and interests of Persia; hence the attainment of the desired result in this matter depends upon the good faith which the Company shows in this respect. f . / Iw ^ P V 0 P ara g ra P h 3 of your respected note, I have the honour to state that the Persian Government does not regard itself as responsible C ?- a wTr a ^ age accruin g to Company, and responsibility for any damage which the Company may possibly suffer will rest on the Company itself.' Kino^ 0n re f| 1 ? 1 t of t v 1S / e ? iy ' His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom regretfully realised that a serious dispute had arisen between the eisian Government and themselves. The Persian Government had presented notnmg m the nature of a legal justification for its action in cancelling the concession, and, while it appeared to indicate the possibility of 'direct iscussions with the above-mentioned Company with a view to the negotiation ot a new concession which would safeguard in an equitable manner the rights7 and mtcrcBts of Persia,' it was plain that, in its view, any such negotiations should proceed upon the basis that the existing concession had been terminated. In view oi the terms of the concession, it was impossible for His Majesty's Government to accept any such contention, especially as the Persian Government had purported to cancel the concession without taking any steps to invoke the arbitration provisions of article 17 of the concession. In these circumstances His Majesty s Government were of opinion that, in the event of the Persian Government persisting in their attitude, the proper course was for the dispute which had arisen between that Government and themselves to be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice under the optional clause (article 36 of the Statute of the Court), since both the Persian Government and themselves had accepted the jurisdiction of the court under that article. 30. Accordingly, on the 8th December, 1932, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran presented a further note to the Persian Government in the following terms :— ' (1) His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have had under consideration your Excellency's note of the 3rd December, replying to my note of the 2nd December, in regard to the Persian Government's cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's concession. I have the honour to inform your Excellency that His Majesty's Government are unable to admit the validity of a unilateral cancellation of this concession. Such a cancellation is a confiscatory measure and a clear breach of international law against a British company, and His Majesty's Government feel obliged to take the matter up in the exercise of their rights to protect the interests of their nationals. His Majesty's Government have, from the outset, as pointed out in my note of the 2nd December, and as repeated in the state ment made by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons on the 5th December, been anxious that an amicable settlement may be reached between the Persian Government and the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. His Majesty's Government cannot, however, regard the Persian Government's note of the 3rd December as offering any satisfac tory basis for such a settlement. As I explained on the 2nd December, His Majesty's Government consider the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the concession to be an inadmissible breach of the terms of that instrument, and have therefore requested the withdrawal of the notification to the Company of the 27th November. Since the Persian Government in their reply adduce no argument which can be regarded as in any way justifying their action. His Majesty's Government must reiterate their request. . '' (2) Should the Persian Government be unwilling to withdraw their notification of the cancellation of the concession within one week from the date of the present note, i.e., Thursday, the 15th December, His Majesty's Government will have no alternative to referring the dispute which has arisen between them and the Persian Government in regard to the legality of the Persian Government's action to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, as a matter of urgency, under the optional clause. In so doing His Majesty's Government woul^ request the court to indicate, under article 41 of the statute, the provisional measures which ought to be taken to preserve their rights. , . , ' (3) Further I am instructed to state that my Government do not accept the attitude outlined in paragraph 3 of your note to the effect that the Persian Government cannot regard themselves as responsible for any damage accruing to the Company. On the contrary, I have the honour to inform your Exlellency categorically that His Majesty s Government will hold the Persian Government directly responsible for any damage to the Company's interests, any interference with their premises or business activities in Persia, or any failure to afford the Company adequate protection, and, in the event of any such damage occurring. His Majesty s Government will regard themselves as entitled to take all such measures as the sltuTon may demand for that Company's protection.' 31 On the 12th December, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran received a lengthy note in replv from the Persian Government. The complete text of this reply is not yet in the hands of His Majesty's Government, but it appears from8 the summary which they have received that the note, after setting out under nine ^ heads the causes of the dissatisfaction of the Persian Government with the ^ Company and stating that Persia had always respected her international ^ obligations while upholding her rights, and had, therefore, never refused to set I ' forth its difficulties and to expose to competent international courts violations of F? the rights of the country, continued as follows :— l w ' In the present instance, as your Excellency, in the name of your Government, and basing yourself on article 36 of the Statute of the L, Permanent Court of International Justice, alludes to a reference to that court, I deem it my duty to draw your Excellency's attention to the fact that, f 8 if the stipulations of the article referred to had placed the examination of irjr t such question within the competence of that court, the Persian Government, p of course, would not have hesitated at all to accept a reference to that court, rf but it appears that the Permanent Court of International Justice is not r competent for the examination of differences which have arisen between the ' &lt;fCfeI Persian Government and the Company, because article 36 of the said P? statute designates the competence of that court in such a way, in all cases r . where reference to the Permanent Court is made on the basis of the optional P clause, that the circumstances of the present case do not correspond with ^ them.' ^ lie The note continued ;— m ' Your Excellency repeats in paragraph 3 of your note that you consider wed the Persian Government as responsible for losses which the Company may suffer. The Persian Government cannot understand how, while on the one hand they have no participation whatever in the activities of the Company,, and, on the other hand, they have not interfered and do not interfere with the affairs of the Company nor cause them any inconvenience, any responsibility can devolve on them; and it is on the above grounds that I have the honour to reiterate that the Company itself is responsible for any losses which it may suffer.' The note then stated that the Persian Government had never refused to come to terms with the Company, and concluded as follows :— '' And the reason why the Persian Government did not take measures after the cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession to interfere with the Company's institutions, and still hold for the time being to the same decision in the hope of attaining the desired result, is that my Government have hoped that the Company, instead of entering into the sphere of disputes over principles and of judicial controversies, would not lose the opportunity of sending their duly authorised representative to Tehran in order that he might || enter into negotiations forthwith with the Persian Government, with a view |j to concluding an agreement which would safeguard the legitimate interests ^ of Persia. But, in practice, it appears unfortunately that His Majesty's L Government are, perhaps, not in favour of such an agreement between the m Persian Government and the Company, because the threats and intimidation which His Majesty's Government are bringing to bear on my Government, and the unacceptable demands that are put forward prevent, in practice, both the Persian Government and the Company from taking a single step towards reaching a mutual agreement; and although the British Legation has so far not interfered in the discussions between the Persian Government and the Company, it has now become an obstacle between the two parties, and has adopted an attitude which does away at once with any hope for success in the conclusion of a new agreement with the Company, and the authorities of the Persian Government cannot but regret that although His Majesty's Govern ment are certainly aware of the deceptions practised on the Persian Government and of their losses, far from advising and encouraging the Company to take advantage of the good faith of the Persian Government and to hasten the amelioration of their situation, are on the contrary encouraging the Company to resist by pressure that they bring to bear on the Persian Government. The Persian Government consider this attitude of His Majesty's Government as incompatible with the spirit of uprightness and the desire for peace which should prevail amongst friendly Powers and members of the League of Nations, and consider themselves within their9 rights in bringing to the notice of the Council of the League of Nations the threats and pressure which have been directed against them. 32. It will be seen that in this note the Persian Government disputes the competence of the Permanent Court of International Justice &lt;% for the examina tion of the differences which have arisen between the Persian Government and the Company,' and, finally, intimates its intention of bringing the matter before the Council of the League. His Majesty's Government do not accept the contention, which seems to be that put forward by the Persian Government, that because the present situation had its origin in differences between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Permanent Court is not competent to decide the dispute which has now arisen between the Persian Government and His Majesty's Government: such a contention is inconsistent with decisions of the Permanent Court itself. His Majesty's Government are, however, aware that, by the terms of its acceptance of the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court under the optional clause {' League of Nations Treaty Series, Vol. 104, p. 492-3), the Persian Government reserved the right ' to require that proceedings in the court shall be suspended in respect of any dispute which has been submitted to the Council of the League of Nations,' and they realise, there fore, that should they carry out their original intention of submitting the matter to the Permanent Court, and should the Persian Government then bring the matter before the Council, that Government would be entitled to put a stop to the proceedings before the Permanent Court, with the result that the time which had been spent on those proceedings would be thrown v away. In these circumstances His Majesty's Government think it right to adopt the other course which is open to them under article 15 of the Covenant, and to submit the matter to the Council. 33. His Majesty's Government are compelled to take a serious view of the situation created by the action of the Persian Government. It is admitted that certain differences have arisen between the Persian Government and the Company as to the computation of the royalties payable to the Persian Government and that, as a result thereof, the Persian Government desired a modification o* ttie arrangement made in 1920. But, as explained above, these differences had been settled by a preliminary agreement between his Highness the Minister of Court and the chairman of the company, which was approved by the Council ot Ministers in February last, and a detailed agreement to give effect to the general principles laid down in that preliminary agreement had been initialled on behalt of the Persian Government and the Company and had been under consideration bv the Persian Government since May last. It is true that the Persian Govern ment was understood to be preparing further proposals of its own, but these proposals had never been communicated to the Company. In these circumstances, it is idle for the Persian Government to contend that the Company has shown anv unwillingness to reach a reasonable settlement of the difficulties which had arisen But it was in these circumstances that the Persian Government without making any attempt to invoke the arbitration provisions of article 17 of the concession, took, on the 27th November last, the step of purporting to cancelling the concession His Majesty's Government can only regard this action as a unilateral act of confiscation committed by the Persian Government against the Company, and it is well established under international law that the confiscatory cancellation by a Government of a concession held by a foreign company is an act contrary to international law; in the present instance the action of the Persian Government constitutes an international wrong done to the United Kingdom in the person of a British company. Moreover, it is plain that, if the ^ncellaTion of the concession which the Persian Government has purported to effect were to be followed by an attempt by the Persian Government to take possession of the Company's extensive and immensely valuable properties and nW ii Persia or should any action or inaction of the Persian Government lead to serious damkge to these properties and plant, or adversely affect the safety of the Companyl personnel a situation of the utmost gravity would arise , and ot tne oompdii^ F Maiestv's Government observe with much disquietude tfS . c—Slon. q „.»d A- the Persian h.. consistently declined to accept any responsibility for loss or damage to the Commnv although under article 14 of the concession the Persian Government isTounT to take any necessary measures to protect the property and employees of the Company. [8026]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT December 30.) December 30, 1932. Section 3. (No. 412.) Sir, Angora, December 21, 1932. I HAVE the honour to report that the cancelling of the concession of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has aroused interest in this country, and the course of the dispute between His Majesty's Government and the Persian Government is being followed with close attention. It might have been expected that the Turkish press would have shown a tendency to gloat over Persia's cavalier treat ment of a foreign concessionary company, and its curt defiance of a powerful Western nation, and would have lost no opportunity of congratulating the Persian Government on its close imitation of Turkish methods. Its comments, however, have, up to the present, been sober and restrained. This is the more surprising when one takes into consideration the annoyance which has been caused in ruling circles by the blackening of the Gazi's character in ' Grey Wolf,' and by the publicity given to the fez incident by the London press—a publicity which it has become the fashion to pretend was deliberate and malevolent, with the object of embittering Turco-Egyptian relations. 2. The official Anatolian Press Agency has confined itself to reproducing, without bias or comment, foreign telegrams on the dispute. The Milliyet of the 6th December, after giving a historical survey of the foundation of the oil company, and recalling that the majority of the shares are held by His Majesty's Government, adds ;— ' If this denunciation had taken place before the Great War, the British fleet would have been mobilised, the British Minister would have transmitted an ultimatum to the Shah of Persia, and the question would have been settled. This could not be done to-day because the British Government appreciates that this question cannot be settled by force, and, moreover, it is itself occupied in the search for reasons for cancelling its own engagements to America.' In a later issue, the Milliyet criticises the menacing attitude of Great Britain towards Persia, but is confident that a peaceful settlement of the dispute will be reached. The Republique of the 13th December attributes the cancellation of the concession to the fact that the company had lessened its production, as a result of a diminished world demand, thereby reducing its contribution to the Persian Treasury. The gravity of the dispute is to be measured by the fact that the British Government has despatched a flagship and two light cruisers to the Persian Gulf. If it is true that in many towns the inhabitants, during the official rejoicings over the denunciation of the concession, tore up British flags, the matter is no longer a purely legal one. It is, after the Mosul dispute, one of the thorniest in Western Asia, and, if settled by violence, will put an end, for many years, to international security and tranquillity. The &amp;on Postd of the 17th December writes :— ' Persia's reasons for the denunciation of the concession are connected with the question of national sovereignty. According to the statement of the British Under-Secretary in the House of Commons, and to the semi official British press, it would appear that Russia isconcerned in this question.. Everyone is aware that the Persian Government, and particularly Timurtash Khan are secretly inclined to Russia. The serious difference between Great Britain and Persia will undoubtedly be settled, for both nations are members of the League of Nations, and are bound to refer to The Hague Tribunal for the settlement of any dispute.' [663 gg 3]2 The Cumhuriyet of the 20th December expresses the opinion that, although Great Britain has made no serious resistance to Persia over the Imperial Airways ind Indo-European Telegraph questions, it will never give way in the present dispute, and Persia will therefore be well advised to come to an agreement on the basis of the Mosul settlement. 3. I had an opportunity of hearing the views of Tevfik Ru§tu Bey and of the Persian Ambassador here on the dispute. Tevfik Rii^tu asked me if I had noticed the restrained tone of' the Turkish press, and, on being assured that its attitude seemed satisfactory, took credit for this state of affairs as he had enjoined on the press to observe moderation in its comments. Sadek Khan Sadek, who has personally visited the oil-fields, was enthusiastic in his praise of the great work done by the company for the welfare and health of its Persian employees .and for the prosperity which it has brought to Persia, and characterised the action of his Government as a serious blunder. 4.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of despatches from three of His Majesty s consular officers in Persia illustrative of the methods used to promote popular enthusiasm at the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession. 2. There can be no doubt that these celebrations were not only inspired, but enforced, in every town throughout Persia. 3. The effect of the immediate rise in the price of kerosene at Tabriz and of the rumours of a similar increase in Shiraz is worth noting. 4. I would also draw your attention to Mr. Summerscale's remarks upon the slight increase in anti-foreign feeling caused by the Government propaganda. No similar feeling is yet apparent in the capital. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 261), the acting British consul-general, Meshed (No. 35), the acting British consul, Tabriz (No. 33), and the acting British consul, Shiraz (No. 22). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Acting Consul-General Daly to Mr. Hoare. (No. 50. Confidential.) Sir, Meshed, December 5, 1932. I HAVE the honour to report that a meeting was held at the Meshed Chamber of Commerce on the 3rd December, 1932, which was attended by the Governor-General and other officials, and to which some 500-800 guests were invited. A copy of the invitation card is attached^ 1 ) One Haji Mahommed Jafar Kashmiri (formerly a British-protected person, but who has assumed Persian nationality) and Shushtari, chief inspector of the Shrine, made speeches denouncing the D'Arcy Concession, &amp;c., and the letter alleged to have been written by the Persian Government to the company was read. There is no doubt but that the meeting was held under orders from Tehran and there are strong grounds for suspecting that the Soviet consulate-general supplied the funds for purchase of refreshments to make the meeting attractive. Reports from Birjand, Zahedan and Zabul indicate that the inhabitants there were also made to decorate their premises by police coercion. Up to the date of this despatch I have received no reports of any interference with the company's agents. I have, &amp;c. C. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E. ( l ) Not printed. [691 b—3]Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Actinq Consul Davis to Mr. Hoare. (No. 57.) Tabriz, December 6, 1932. WITH reference to my despatch No. 56 of the 2nd December last, I have the honour to report that the cancellation of the D'ArCy Concession is being celebrated here for seven days commencing from Saturday, the 3rd December. The principal bazaars, shops and houses have been decorated with carpets, flags and streamers, and at night there are illuminations to a certain degree. The local chamber of commerce, leading merchants and notables have held receptions in honour of the event, with the attendance of the Governor-General and other officials, and at these receptions speeches have been made in praise of the Government's action. The people have been regaled with free cinema shows, performances by the military band, and other festive manifestations. 2. Many of the tradespeople who were required by the police to decorate and illuminate their shops appeared to have but a very vague idea as to what the celebrations were about. The few who do understand find their ardour somewhat damped by the fact that the first practical outcome of the cancellation of the concession has been an increase of 4 rials per pood in the price of Russian kerosene. There is, as already explained, no Anglo-Persian Oil Company kerosene on sale here. 3. It is to be noted that Government offices and institutions have been exempt from the general outburst of decorations. Apparently the Government wishes it to be understood that the initiative in the abrogation of the concession has come from the people and that the nation is delirious with joy at the Govern ment's acquiescence to its insistent demands. It is, however, quite safe to say that here, in Azerbaijan, there was no popular agitation against the concession at all, and no spontaneous outburst of joy at its annulment, the supposed rejoicings reported above being entirely due to the direct inspiration of the authorities, backed up in most cases by the usual Persian methods of forcible persuasion. I have, &amp;c. A. W. DAVIS. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Actinq Consul Summerscale to Mr. Hoare (No. 49.) Shiraz, December 10, 1932. WITH reference to your circular telegram No. 7 of the 30th November relative to the cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession, I have the honour to report that it was not till some five or six days later that the news was general property in Shiraz. It is perhaps unnecessary to mention that there was nothing resembling any spontaneous expression of gratification on the part of the local populace. The Shiraz agent of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (the manager of Messrs. Ziegler and Co.) reported that his business had not been interfered with in any way and that his sales of Anglo-Persian Oil Company products were maintained at their normal level. 2. On the 5th December, as the result of pressure exerted by the local Persian Government officials, a meeting was held in the main square'(Maidan-i- Pahlavi, as it is now called) at 4-30 p.m . The chief speaker was the editor of the Gulistan, who apparently aspires to be the local equivalent of Rahnema. After praising the policy of the present Shah, he expressed his joy at the cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession, denounced the Anglo-Persian Oil Company not only for cheating the Persian Government, but also for intriguing with, and supplying arms to, the tribes. He also protested against the presence of foreigners and consuls in Persia and expressed the hope that they all would be expelled. In the evening the most important Imam Zadeh of Shiraz—the Shah-i-Cheragh— was illuminated and various speeches were made. The editor of the Gulistan produced a slightly different version of his previous oration, and was followed by a Mulla named Bilaghat, who managed to combine the greatness of the Moslem religion, the glory of Reza Shah and the downfall of the Anglo-Persian Oil€ onl p a ny into a single speech. On the 7th December a celebration was held in front o^the house of Seyyid Abu Talib, one of the new candidates for the Majlis, in the Kniaban-i-Zand, about 200 yards from this consulate. Multi-coloured •electric lights framed the house and platform. The heads of the Finance, Post and ielegraph and Police Departments were present, in addition to a small number 01 merchants. The meeting did not seem to attract a large crowd of ordinary citizens, of whom not more than a hundred gathered around. It is interesting that amongst the merchants were some whose feelings cannot be very strongly anti-foreign, as, for instance, the Dehkan Brothers and Hidayat, the Ford agent. The editor of the Gulistan was again the main speaker and made ^ speech not materially different from the two previous ones. After this the merchants met m the garden of the same house in a building called the ' Chamber of Commerce, where the repetition of the same speeches took place. 3. The effect of these various meetings and local newspaper articles has certainly been to arouse a certain feeling of animosity to foreigners and foreign institutions. A reluctance to salute or show signs of recognition has been noticed by Europeans amongst Persians previously quite friendly. The Khan Bahadur of this consulate, who has a large number of friends, has been requested by some to wear the Pahlavi cap if he visits them or goes walking with them. While a few Persians seem genuinely to feel that the denunciation of the •concession was, if not dishonourable, at least impolitic, the majority seem to be swayed by the carefully nursed feeling that a victory has been scored over the foreigner. However, a rumour which is now making itself heard, to the effect that under a new arrangement kerosene and petrol will be considerably dearer, may serve to temper this enthusiasm. 4. On the 9th December wireless news of the note presented to the Persian Government, correct in substance, but omitting that part concerning reference of the dispute to the Permanent Court of International Justice, caused considerable apprehension amongst British residents in Shiraz. This apprehension was calmed to some extent on the reception of the correct text of the note on the next day, but again aroused by a rumour of forcible measures being undertaken by the Persian Government to prevent the export of oil from Mohammerah. The distance of Shiraz from any centre directly concerned in the question makes the receipt of reliable news very slow, and in the meantime the variety of rumours, some, such as that of an already existing new arrangement between the Anglo- Persian Oil Company and the Persian Government, obviously false x and others more credible, is confusing to those following the development of the dispute.

Extract froin Provisional Minutes of the Sixteenth Meeting {Public) held on December 19, 1932, at Geneva.—{Received in Foreign Office, December 29.) Dispute between the Government of the United Kingdom and. the Government of Persia. M. SEPAHBODI, representative of Persia, came to the Council table. THE PRESIDENT ; My colleagues will have received Document C.841.1932.VII containing the memorandum of the Government of the United Kingdom on the subject of the dispute concerning the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Document C.844.1932.VII, which contained the letter addressed to the Secretary-General on the 17th December by the permanent delegate of Persia accredited to the League of Nations, has also been circulated. In this letter, the permanent delegate of Persia communicated a telegram from his Government, informing him that it had intended to lay the dispute before the Council, and that pending an agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company it had not taken any steps against the company and did not intend to do so. The Persian Govern ment thought, however, that the Council should not begin the examination of this question until sufficient time had been allowed for the despatch to Geneva of a representative from Tehran with all the documentary material in the possession of the Tehran Government. This appears to me to be a reasonable request, and the Council may wish to postpone consideration of the matter until the January session. In these circumstances, I have sent the following telegram to the two parties yesterday, the 18th December :— ' I am fully confident that pending examination by the Council of the dispute between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Persia concerning the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the two Governments will refrain from any act or step that might aggravate or extend the dispute.'^ 1 ) Since this matter has been laid before the Council under article 15 of the Covenant, the Secretary-General has certain preliminary duties to fulfil, duties which are indicated in the first paragraph of the article. He has, I understand, already taken the preliminary steps which such an appeal necessitates. Perhaps he will now be good enough to inform the Council of what he has done. THE DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL : Upon receipt of the letter of the 14th December from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom asking him to place the dispute between the United Kingdom Government and the Persian Government concerning the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the Council's agenda, the Secretary-General the same day brought this request to the knowledge of the members of the Council and of the Persian Government through the Persian permanent delegate at Geneva, and, as it was his duty to do, duly placed the question on the Council's agenda. After receiving the United Kingdom Government's memorandum on the matter, I immediately brought it to the notice of the Council. Taking advantage of the presence of the members of the Council at Geneva, I thought it right, in accordance with the United Kingdom Government's request, to draw their attention to the last paragraph in its memorandum. That is the reason for the meeting to-day. On receipt of the Persian Government's communication, which has been circulated to you, I sent that Government yesterday, the 18th December, after consulting the President of the Council and following on the despatch of his telegram, the telegram which is reproduced in Document C.846.M.386.1932.VII.( 2 &gt; (') Document C.847.M.391,1932.VII. ( 2 ) See Annex 2. [663 ff—2] b k\ I shall, of course, act in accordance with the provisions of article 15 of the Covenant. If need be the members of the Council will, I am sure, help me in carrying out my duties prescribed in article 15 with a view to a full investigation and consideration of the matter. SIR WILLIAM MALKIN : I have to express to the Council, on behalf of Sir John Simon, his great regret that he has been prevented by indisposition from coming to Geneva for to-day's meeting of the Council. It is a matter of great satisfaction to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom that the Council has been able to meet to-day to take cognisance of the question which they have found it necessary to bring before it. His Majesty's Government were anxious that the matter should come before the Council without delay, because they felt that the situation resulting from the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the concession held by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company contained elements which required it to be dealt with by the Council as a matter of urgency. Accordingly, I am grateful to you, Mr. President, for the action which, as you have just informed the Council, you and the Secretary-General with your assent have thought it proper to take; and I trust that the result of that action will be to ensure that the matter will be considered here in due course without the occurrence of any events which might call for the immediate intervention of the Council. On the merits of the dispute, it would, I conceive, be premature for me to say anything at this stage; the case of His Majesty's Government is stated in the memorandum which has been communicated to the Secretary-General in accordance with article 15, paragraph 2 of the Covenant, and is in the hands of the members of the Council.( 3 ) But, as you have stated, Mr. President, that the matter will figure on the agenda of the meeting which opens on the 23rd January, 1933, I desire to express the earnest hope of my Government that the matter wili be ready for consideration by the Council on that date. I recognise that the Persian Government are entitled to a reasonable period for the preparation of their case, but it will, I think, be agreed that His Majesty's Government have not been dilatory in the preparation and presentation of their memorandum, and as five weeks will elapse before the 23rd January, His Majesty's Government may, I submit, fairly expect that the case of the Persian Government will reach the Secretary-General in time to allow the Council to take the matter into consideration at the session which opens on that date. M. feEPAHBODI: Mr. President, at 8 p.m . on the 14th December I received two letters from the Secretary-General communicating copies of the letter from ms Lxcellency Sir John Simon and of the Foreign Office telegram These documents informed me that His Britannic Majesty's Government had requested an urgent meeting of the Council for the 19th or 20th December. The Foreign Omce telegram stated that the United Kingdom Government's memorandum would be communicated shortly I received the English text of the memorandum at 8 p.m . on the 16th December only. On receiving the first two letters I informed my Government of the subject of the request of His Britannic Majestv's Govern ment. A summary of the memorandum, which contains twenty-four paffes was also telegraphed to my Government at midnight on the day on which it was received. My Government therefore is not yet in possession of the necessary particulars and has not had time to form a complete and exact idea of the reasons tor which His Britannic Majesty's Government has seen fit to invoke article 15 ot the Covenant m connexion with a dispute between Persia and the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. &amp; At midday on the 17th December I received a telegram( 4 ) from my Govern ment the contents of which I duly communicated to the Secretary-General the same day. Ihis communication has been circulated to the members of the Council but it would, I think, be advisable that I should read part of it here . ' we are not yet in possessioii of the request addressed to the Council i ^ r ^ an - nic Majesty s Government We are not aware in what manner and on what bases the Council has been a^ked to deal with this question. We cannot therefore come to any decision in the matter. The Persian Government had already decided to notify the Council of the intimidating— it might almost be said threatening—attitude which His Britannic Majesty's ( 3 ) Document C.84U932 .Vir. (*) Document 0.844.1932.VII (see Annex 1).3 (xovernment has thought fit to adopt towards Persia. We have therefore no objection to the matter's being laid before the Council. Should the Council intend examining whether the Persian Government was or was not entitled to cancel the concession, it is obvious that the Council will deem it necessary to wait until a Persian representative can attend. We consider, moreover, that prior to adopting any attitude whatsoever the Council must first hear the Persian Government's statement. As the discussion of this question will require the presence of a special representative who will have to be sent from Tehran, and as the documents are at present in that city, it will be materially impossible for the Council to begin its examination of the matter immediately. Furthermore, as the Persian Government has already stated that pending an agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company it has pqt taken and has no intention of taking any measures against that under- there is no reason for considering the matter as urgent.' As you will realise, my Government is only asking for the necessary time to send as its representatives special delegates, who will have to come from Tehran. I therefore propose that the Council should adjourn until they arrive. On reading the British memorandum I was glad to see that in paragraph 35 the United Kingdom Government states : ' His Majesty's Government are most anxious that the present dispute shall not disturb the friendly relations which have hitherto existed between the Persian Government and themselves and they have every hope that the action of the Council will result in amicable and equitable settlement of the dispute.' It adds that His Majesty's Government will do everything in their power to co-operate to this end. As the Persian Government is no less anxious than the United Kingdom Government to maintain the friendly relations which exist between the two countries and by which they have been united for many years, may I venture, without anticipating my Government's opinion, to put forward a personal consideration. I wonder whether the present situation really necessitated an appeal to article 15? In conclusion, I renew my proposal for an adjournment pending the arrival of the special delegates who will be provided with the necessary documents and instructions. THE PRESIDENT : My colleagues will join me, I am sure, in expressing the Council's satisfaction with the action taken by the Secretary-General and with what he proposed to do by way of preparation for our work. Pending the Persian Government's communication of its statement and the completion of the Secretary-General's arrangements as provided for in article 15 of the Covenant, the Council might perhaps decide at once to place this question on the agenda of its next ordinary session on the 23rd January, 1933. I think I shall be voicing the unanimous view of the Council by expressing to the two parties its full confidence that nothing will be done that might prejudice the Council's action or aggravate or enlarge the dispute. May I add that the procedure which it is the clear duty of the Council to follow does not, of course,, exclude the possibility of an understanding between the two parties. The procedure proposed hy the President was approved. (M. Sepahbodi withdrew.) The Deputy Secretary-General withdrew and his place was taken by the Secretary-General. [663 ff—2] B 24 -(C.844.1932.

THE Secretary-General has the honour to circulate to the Council the following letter, dated the 17th December, which he has received from the permanent delegate of Persia accredited to the League of Nations To the Secretary-General. Sir, Geneva, December 17, 1932. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated the 14th December with which you were good enough to send me a copy of a letter from Sir John Simon, His Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, together with the telegram from the Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, urgently requesting the summoning of the Council of the League of Nations to examine a dispute which has arisen between Persia and His Britannic Majesty's Government regarding the cancellation by my Government of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company's concession. I hasten to inform you that I have duly telegraphed to my Government informing it of the contents of the above-mentioned communications. I have just received a reply of which the following is a translation :— ' As we are not yet in possession of the request addressed to the Council by His Britannic Majesty's Government we are not aware in what manner and on what bases the Council has been asked to deal with this question. We cannot therefore come to any decision in the matter.

Should the Council intend examining whether the Persian Government was or was not entitled to cancel the concession, it is obvious that the Council will deem it necessary to wait until a Persian representative can attend. We consider, moreover, that prior to adopting any attitude whatsoever the Council must first hear the Persian Government's statement. As the discussion of this question will require the presence of a special representative who will have to be sent from Tehran, and as the documents are at present in that city, it will be materially impossible for the Council to begin its examination of the matter immediately. Furthermore, as the Persian Government has already stated that pending an agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company it has not taken and has no intention of taking any measures against that undertaking, there is no reason for considering the matter as urgent.' I may add that as it was not until last evening that I received the English text of the request of His Britannic Majesty's Government that the matter should be laid before the Council I have only been able to communicate a brief summary of that document to my Government. In accordance, moreover, with the terms of article 15, paragraph 2, of the Covenant under which His Britannic Majesty's Government professes to be acting, it is essential that the parties should have been able to ' communicate statements of their case with all the relevant facts and papers.' Such being the case I should be grateful if you would inform me of the action which you propose to take upon this communication.—A. S epahbodi.Annex 2. L eague of N ations. {C.846.M.386.1932. VII.)

THE Persian press during the past three weeks has published a large number of articles concerning the cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession and the events subsequent thereto. Most of the articles are very long, and they are full of repetitions. The similarity of the arguments used leaves little room for doubt that the writers wrote under the direct inspiration and order of the Persian Government. The articles may therefore be regarded as supplementing, to some extent, the official Persian notes on the subject, and 1 have the honour to report hereunder a summary of the most important editorials of the Iran, the Shafaq-i- and the^ ji .u 2. On the 21st and 22nd December all Tehran newspapers published lengmy comments on the speech by which Sir William Malkin brought the British case before the Council of the League of Nations. The sum of 11 millions received by Persia is contrasted with the enormous benefits received by His Majesty s Government, in income tax and other ways, and by British companies. Ihe statement that any arrangement early this year was ever agreed to by the Persian Government is described as an absolute lie. The arguments concerning tne invalidity of the D'Arcy Concession from the outset are repeated. No constitu tional Government existed in 1901, and no confirmation by the Majlis nad ever taken place. The dishonest methods of accounting of the Anglo-Persian Uil Company and of its subsidiaries are set forth, together with Mr. Armitage- Smith's exposure of them. It is denied that His Majesty s Government were the first to appeal to the League. Persia really invoked the League s aid hist. It was a great pity that the Persian Government, through no fault of their own were not able to make the first speech and be the plaintiffs against the unwarranted intrusion of the British Government. A long argument is developed concerning the British Government's insistence on the Persian Government s acceptance ot responsibility for losses suffered by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the suggestion being that this clearly means that Britain seeks an excuse for invadmg the oil-fields and taking possession of them, after causing th ® Company to trump up an allegation of damage suffered. The Sha f^~ S y^ 1 concludes one of its articles bv the statement that the conscience of the great Persian people is clear in this matter. All Persians, with one accord, have acclaimed the cancellation with joy and unanimtv , hence even if ^ ca ^ at Geneva the Persian position before the world is clear and histoiy will vindicate us 'V.The same paper, in another article, asks what right the British have to interfere in Persian internal affairs, when condemn the uhfortunate Egyptian people, 15 capitulatory regime, not to mention the repression of the national aspirations of the ^^Yarg^number of extracts from European papers are also published by the Tehran papers The Ittild'dt publishes, with evident approval, an extract from an artfcle in the New Statesman of the 3rd December saying that^His Maiesty's Government are foolish to threaten force, and would be well , - , •' i, frpsh asreement Prominence is also given to an article m the circulated in the Soviet wireless) arguing that the Bntish difficulties at present are due to the fact that they failed to support the Sheikh of Mohamn^rah sufficiently. most ^ series of articles is t(&gt; • /■ ^IT/riouHssu^'of the Shaf between the 9th and the aLdTelmber In all nine articles appeared, from the ' pen of a well-informed writer 'From the nature of the evidence used it is certain that the writer had [691 r-41had access to a great number of documents which could only be found either in the archives of the Persian Government or with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, The negotiations of Mr. Armitage-Smith are alluded to in detail, and the course of the conversations with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company during the last six years were evidently well known to the author; and it seems very probable, if not certain, that they were from the pen of Teymourtache himself. A summary of the articles is as follows :— First article. —-The Persian Government are entitled in law and in equity to cancel the D'Arcy Concession and the 1920 agreement, to proceed against the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for damages, and to refuse to grant a new concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Let us begin with the 1920 agreement. Mr. Armitage-Smith was an official of the British Treasury; hence, whatever he did, was subject to undue influence from the British side. The Persian Government never recognised the agreement and did not ratify it. Why did Armitage-Smith agree to deduct 6 shillings for every ton of oil refined outside Persia ? Certain fixed deductions were made in calculating the royalties payable by the distributing companies. The deduction of 6 shillings per ton meant a loss to the Government of £7,200,000. Second article. —The National Oil Refineries (Limited), which owns the Llandarcy refinery, is a source of great income to the British Government. But the royalties payable by this and other refining companies are subject • to much greater deductions than in the case of the Abadan refinery. The rates of deduction allowed in calculating the sums payable by distributing companies are quoted in detail, and stress is laid on the fact that the rates of deduction are fixed amounts per gallon; hence, in times of low prices, the real burden of the deduction and the disadvantage to the Persian Government are greater than they ought equitably to be. Third article. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company is a centre for intrigues against the Persian Government. It has indulged in bribery, and has fostered the secret spread of British imperialism. It concluded various agreements with local chiefs instead of with the Central Government. Mr. Churchill's book. The World Crisis, is adduced as evidence in support of the statement that the British Government effected a saving of £7,500,000. through cheaper oil during the war. On the other hand, the manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at one time wrote a letter using threats against the officer commanding the Southern Persian army, stating that if he did not select the Governor of Abadan, in accordance with the desires of the company, the manager would insist on cash payment for oil supplied. Fourth article. —Mr. Armitage-Smith exceeded and transgressed the authority he possessed from the Persian Government. He professed to find that no fixed price per ton of oil was possible; why, therefore, did he, without authority, agree to deductions, fixed in money, from the selling price of oil products in calculating the royalty ? Hence, to sum up, the 1920 agreement is invalid for the following reasons : {a) It has never been ratified by the Majlis; {h) it was based on fraud, ignorance, and the exercise of undue influence; (c) it was based on threats; (d) it involved deceit; {e) Mr. Armitage- Smith exceeded his authority. Fifth article. —We now turn to the original concession of 1901. It is a general principle that force cannot create a right. A change of regime cancels all such agreements. Rousseau is quoted as an authority. The fact that the Persian Government did not proceed to cancel the concession at once makes no difference. Silence for a time may be due to ignorance or other causes not the fault of the Government. If the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Concession is held to be valid, it would be possible to argue that the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1919, the South Persian Rifles, and the capitulatory regime have not been legally abolished or ended. The reasons for the Persian Government's silence hitherto have been : {a) Fear of pressure which would have been brought by His Majesty's Government; and (&amp;) the Persian Government did not hitherto possess sufficient power to defend its rights; but now that every male Persian of 21 years of age joins the colours, things are different. If a Persian subject possessed a concession in England, would the Persian Government lose their heads and appeal to the League without referring to competent quarters in England? But the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have not had recourse to Persian law.-v Sixth article. —The Persian Government has not consented to the adjudication of the League in regard to the substance of the dispute. They have no intention of doing that. All they are doing is to complain to the League of the interference of His Majesty's Government in an internal question. Our courts are open to all who may wish to apply to them. A number of other firmans have been cancelled, e.g., the firmans connected with the grant of ' tuyul ' (feudal dues); firmans connected with the transfer of crown lands; the firman concerning Abadan; the firman concerning the banks of the Karun River, held by the Sheikh of Mohammerah. To sum up, the D'Arcy Concession is legally invalid, for the following reasons ; {a) It was not ratified by the Majlis; (5) the grantor of the concession was ignorant of what he was granting; {c) the reason for the obligation has disappeared; and {d) deceit and fraud have been practised, and its conditions have not been complied with. Seventh article. —The Iraq Petroleum Company pays 25 per cent, as a royalty, and guarantees £400,000 per annum. The terms of the D'Arcy Concession make it clear that what was really in the mind of the grantor was the surface oil at Shushtar, Qasr-i-Shirin and Daliki; no mention is made of Masjid-i-Suleiman and Haft Khel. Eighth article. —The question of the ' consideration ' for the agree ment is discussed. The 16 per cent, has not really been paid. The concession states (articles 9 and 10) that 16 per cent, had to be paid on all subsidiaries, and (article 12) that Persians are to be employed in all companies and institutions. The intention, therefore, was that all subsidiary companies should be formed in Persia and not abroad. The concessionnaire argues otherwise. This in itself shows that at the very beginning there was no agreement, and therefore no contract. Ninth article. —The company have deprived the Persian Government of the possibility of controlling the accounts. They have also bought flour, -ice and bread from India instead of buying such stores locally; and in various other wavs acted contrary to Persia's interests. 5. The series of articles then stops. Teymourtache was relieved of his duties on the 22nd December. It is not obvious why, with a prospect of the issue becoming the subject of a judicial decision, he should have been at pains to produce in such detail a statement which would make little appeal to the judicial mind.

Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—{Received January 12, 1933.) (No. 568.) Sir, Tehran, December 31, 1932. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of an interview obtained from the Minister for Foreign Affairs by Mr. Lyons, the Moscow correspondent of the United Press of America, who has come here on a brief visit to ' cover ' the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute and will shortly proceed to Geneva. 2. There is little in the interview which has not been said already, either in the official notes of the Persian Government or in the press, but it contains a satisfactorily categorical statement that the Persian Government never had the intention to dispossess the company, but merely desired to clear the ground for a more 'equitable' concession. It is perhaps not unduly cynical to wonder whether the intentions of the Persian Government were not, in some degree, influenced by the discovery that His Majesty's Government, of whose intervention Feroughi complained, as he was bound to do, displayed a lively interest in the matter. 3. Presumably, this interview is an outline of the Persian case as it will be presented at Geneva. I understand that the archives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance have been ransacked in the endeavour to provide documentary proof of the political pressure exercised by His Majesty's Govern ment in order to obtain the concession for Mr. D'Arcy. 4. Mr. Lyons has told me that the Minister for Foreign Affairs refused to answer a number of his questions directed to obtaining some indication of the concessions which the Persian Government hope to obtain from the company. There can be no doubt that refusal in this case is a synonym for inability, and I fancy that it is not unfair to ascribe past and present disagreements to the inability of the Persians to be precise in their demands; they always know they want more, but do not like to say how much lest they introduce an element of finality and then discover that they might have got more than they had asked for. 'Le mieux' is unquestionably 'T'ennemi du bien.' 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 275). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. Interview on the Anglo-Persian Oil Comp Mohammad Ali Khan Feroughi, Per Mr. Eugene Lyons, Manager, Moscow Tehran, on December 24, 1932. Notes (i) THERE assisted at this interview Mirza Hossein Khan Ala, until recently Persian Minister at Paris and now appointed one of the two Persian delegates to present to the Council of the League of Nations Persia s case in the matter of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute (2^ The interview is reported in the form of questions and answers, ihe question had been previously submitted by Mr Lyons to the Minister for Foreign Vffairs The answers were prepared in the Minister s own handwriting in the Persian language. They were then translated into English by the Ministry s translator. And that English translation was carefully corrected by the Minister, assisted by Mr. Ala. Question No 1.—'What, in your Highness's judgment, will be the result of the Geneva action on the Anglo-Persian question? [691 m—1] B2 Answer No. 1.—You may be aware that we were the first to entertain the idea of referring this case to the Council of the League of Nations, the reason being the unfriendly attitude of the British Government in this oil question, and the threats and the pressure which that Government brought to bear upon us. As a matter of fact, there was no ground for such an attitude to be taken by the British Government, because the Persian Government, simultaneously with the annulment of the D'Arcy Concession, intimated to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company its willingness to negotiate a new and fairer agreement based upon the respect of the rights of both parties. But. it is not clear to me for what ulterior motive the British Government found it necessary to interfere in an affair which involved only the Persian Government and the company. At first, the British Government declared that they would refer the case in question to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, but the Persian Government having questioned the competency of the above court, in this special case, and having hinted that they might be led to refer this matter to the Council of the League, the British Government hastened to take the first step; invoking article 15 of the Covenant, they brought the controversy into the category of disputes that might lead to a rupture. Now the Persian Government have always believed in the League of Nations and made it their policy to settle differences by peaceful means. They were among the first to adhere to the League and have constantly sought to co-operate with that institution. They are signatories of the Briand-Kellogg Pact and of numerous arbitration conventions with other countries. It was therefore natural for them, relying as they did upon the justice of their case, to think of appealing to the Council and of welcoming the step taken by the British Government to bring the matter before that august assembly. We are, however, at a loss to know why the British Government have thought fit to interfere in an affair which concerns solely the Persian Government and a private company. Furthermore, we cannot conceive of any reason why the British Government should have considered this as a dispute which might lead to a rupture of diplomatic relations, and, basing themselves on this ground, have invoked the provisions of article 15 of the Covenant. Indeed, the Persian Government have not only manifested their desire to negotiate a new agreement with the company, but have assured the British Government that, pending an amicable settlement with the company, they would refrain from interfering with the latter's operations and activities in Persia. As a matter of fact, since the cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession, the Persian Government have taken no steps whatsoever against the company and not one incident prejudicial to the interests of the company has taken place in Persia. This being the position, I do not believe that the Council of the League will have much difficulty in settling the question submitted to its appreciation. It will become evident that no ground existed for any threat or pressure to be brought to bear upon Persia by the British Government in the discussion between the Persian Government and the company. Moreover, the nature of the dispute has been such as to dispel all thought of any diplomatic rupture happening between the two Governments. It would have been much more expedient if the British Government had not stepped in; and would have allowed the negotiations to go on between the Persian Government and the company unhampered. In all probability the two parties might have reached an agreement and arrived at an understanding which would guarantee the mutual interests of both parties. Now, coming to a different phase of the question, you will agree with me that public opinion everywhere and even in England recognises the natural reluctance of the Persian nation to be bound by a concession granted more than thirty years ago under extremely one-sided and unfavourable conditions. Moreover, the present Government in Persia considers the said concession to be in contradiction with its best interests. Why then, should not the Persian Govern ment proceed to revise the said concession; and why should she overlook and disregard the just claims and the best interests of the nation simply because an ignorant Government in the past has signed an unsatisfactory contract? With the points in our favour I see no reason and no probability that the Council of the League should require of Persia an attitude incompatible with her rights and interests. It is with this spirit of confidence in the justice of our develo3 cause and our assurance in the sense of international justice and the uprightness of the members of the Council that we are proceeding to Geneva; and we are hopeful of a satisfactory conclusion of this affair. Question No. 2.—Who will represent your country before the League in this matter? If a special mission is being sent from Tehran, who will be its head and its members ? Answer No. 2. —Yes, a special mission is being sent to Geneva for this purpose. The principal members of this mission are : His Excellency Davar, the Minister of Justice, and his Excellency Ala, our recent Minister in Paris, formerly Minister in Washington, and for several years a delegate of Persia to the League of Nations. The said mission will leave for Geneva very shortly. Question No. 3.—Pending settlement of the conflict, is there any possibility that the status quo, as to operation of the fields, &amp;c., will be disturbed 1 Answer No. 3.—The answer to this question has been given along with the first question, namely, that the Persian Government, hoping to reach a new agreement with the company, has definitely expressed her attitude of non interference with the activities of the company. Question No. 4.—On what right, either in the concession itself or in inter national law, does Persia base itself in cancelling the concession ? What is the purpose of the annulment—did Persia actually expect to take control of the properties or was it a method of obtaining more favourable conditions? Does the existing concession in any way hamper Persia's great plans for modernisation ? Is its revision essential to His Majesty's policy of national unification and economic advance? A nswer No. 4.—It is an undeniable fact that petroleum is the most important source of natural wealth that Persia possesses. In the modern world, even m countries like the United States of America, whose economic power and prestige is not comparable at all with that of Persia, petroleum is regarded as a valuable economic asset. While Persia, unfortunately, owing to her geographical position and to historical calamities, has been deprived of other sources of natural wealth- lack of great rivers and the natural aridity of her climate are great obstacles towards the development of her agriculture—there are also great natural hindrances towards the development of an industrial Persia; m short, whatever measures are taken for the advancement of either agriculture or industry, or m the shape of road and railway construction for the betterment of commerce, &amp;c all are met with unsurmountable obstacles. As a result, the development ot Persia requires a long period and a good deal of patience, and an enormous amount of capital. r, , These being the circumstances, do you think the Persian Government can afford to give up such an important source of wealth as her oil-fields, and overlook the best interests of the country '! Now, I leave it to your good judgment; suppose the oil resources of America had been leased to somebody on the basis of an idiotic transaction, such as the D'Arcy Concession, how would the American nation feel about it; would they stand such an outrageous situation' I can assure you that the Persian Government and people have never had in mind the thought of laying hands on the properties of the company They do not disregard the pioneer work of the company m the exploitation of these natural resources- but it is the express desire of the Persian Government that both parties to the transaction should receive their due share of the profits. This has been the principal motive for the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the D'Arcv Concession. Persia wants to obtain her proper and legitimate share of her natural resources. She seeks to acquire a share of the profits which would be concomitant with her rights of ownership, and the troubles and the sacrifices, she has to undergo for the sake of the security and the safety of the company.. With what has been said before about the obstacles in the way of Persia s economic develooment it is needless to mention how essential a new and equitable basis of agreement is to the economic interests of Persia The case is self-evident, and speaks for itself; and I think that no man with a gram of justice in his Tnfllrp-iiT) could deny this necessity. , ^ . . We have now to consider very briefly the arguments which Persia advances for the iustiflcation of her action in the annulment of the D Arcy Concession. Tut hp first nlace the company has shown on many occasions its unwillingness to abide 4 the terms of the original concession. Can it be maintained that this [691 m—1] B 2Government alone is obliged to comply with the provisions of the contract? Surely, when one of the parties to an agreement shows any disinclination to execute the clauses and conditions of the contract, the other party is automatically released from its obligations to respect the said contract. This is not the time nor the place to go into any detail as regards the failure of the company in fulfilling its obligations. An attempt to enumerate the instances of negligence on the part of the company would lengthen our interview. For instance, the company has not adequately complied with its undertaking as regards payment of royalties to the Persian Government. While enjoying no immunity from internal taxation, the company has refused to pay the said taxes. Besides, the said company has not given the opportunity to the Persian Govern ment to avail itself of the right of inspection into its accounts. In the case of the determination of ordinary and capital expenditures and the inclusion of the latter in royalty calculations, the company has acted against the spirit of fair play. There are a host of other arguments which will be given at the -appropriate time and place. Question No. 5.—There have been hints in the foreign press about American and Soviet-Russian interest in the Anglo-Persian conflict. Is there any truth in these allegations ? Answer No. 5.—I emphatically deny the said allegations. It is to be much regretted that after the lapse of a period of several years from the accession of His Imperial Majesty to the Throne of Persia, during which space of time the world has witnessed the deeds of the Shah's Government for the liberation of Persia from foreign influences, troublemongers can still succeed in spreading such distortions of actual facts. It has been my good fortune and a great honour to have had in various capacities a close and perfect contact with the national and international policies of His Majesty from the very first days of the establishment of his reign. I have been one of those persons who have been instrumental in the carrying out of His Majesty's decisions for the advancement of the country. I can, therefore, explicitly declare with pride and perfect assurance to the world that the protection of the integrity and independence and the national rights of Persia has been the axis around which the wheel of our diplomacy has been turning for the last decade. In this respect, the present Government of Persia has shown its complete freedom from the influences of outside groups of Govern ments. I am sure of my ground, and I can assure you of this fact, that those persons who endeavour to poison the public opinion of the world in this matter cannot produce the smallest pretext for the justification of their false claims. Question No. 6.—What would be Persia's course of action if England were to land forces to protect British lives and properties ? Answer No. 6.—As I have explicitly made it plain in the answers to the foregoing questions, British life and property are well protected, and there is no probability of encroachment upon their rights in this country. Therefore, it does not seem logical to me to imagine that the British Government would take such action as you mention. Should the contrary happen, the British Government will undoubtedly be considered as an aggressor in relation to Persia, and the Persian Government will not hesitate to take the steps which such an inconceivable attitude on the part of the British Government would entail. Question No. 7.—Is Persia still willing to negotiate its grievances directly with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company ? {a) Would you withdraw the annulment as a preliminary to such negotiations ? (6) Would you insist on negotiating in Tehran, or would London or some neutral point be acceptable ? Answer No. 7.—The first part of this question has been answered already, but the answer to the second part is in the negative. The Persian Government sees no reason for the withdrawal of the annulment of the D'Arcy Concession. The answer to the third part of your question is in the affirmative; the Persian Government will insist upon the negotiations with the company taking place in Tehran. Question No. 8.—Has your Highness any message—on the oil dispute or any other phase of your situation—which I could transmit to the press of the world ?Answer No. 8. I shall be much obliged to you if you will kindly convey the above statements to the press of the world, and emphasise the following points, namely, that the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the D'Arcy Concession has not been prompted by ill will or prejudice towards the company; neither should it be interpreted as an inimical gesture against foreigners in general. Nor was it intended to signify that the Persian Government does not put any real value in the friendship of Great Britain. Our action simply means that we want to protect our just rights and interests. We do sincerely believe that international goodwill and good understanding can only be attained when the nations of the world recognise and respect one another's rights. Friendly relations can exist only when agreements and conventions are not established in a one-sided manner. I have one more request for you, and that is to bring the following fact before jour colleagues in the newspaper world ; From a moral standpoint it is against the integrity and the moral prestige of a newspaper to publish fictitious and false news. As a matter of fact, newspapers have a great moral responsibility; it is through them that public opinion has to be enlightened and led towards the truth. To follow the opposite course would be treason towards their responsibility as torch-bearers of truth and dispensers of goodwill among the nations. I am talking of ideal journalism; but when we come down to bare facts it becomes obvious how far removed we are from the above ideal. When the news of the cancellation of the D'ArcyTJoncession reached the world, immediately after its publication some newspapers in different countries began to publish false news and rumours. Some of them started to talk about brigandage and lack of security in various parts of Persia, and especially in the southern region, where the Anglo- Persian Oil Company's premises are located. It is, I think, perfectly clear to you during your sojourn in the country, that the situation is absolutely normal. Furthermore, security reigns supreme all over the country, particularly in the oil regions, where things are exactly as they were before. Some other newspapers have been talking about the financial needs of Persia, and that she is compelled to sell the Crown jewels and the peacock throne in order to obtain funds. Yet again, newspapers of the same type have reported that the British Government is sending an army and her battleships to Persia. For what purpose are such false rumours disseminated abroad? Is it ethically becoming of the journalistic profession to have to sacrifice their integrity for the sake of sensationalism, and in this way mislead their readers ? Is it not better for the newspapers to endeavour to soothe raging prejudices and to try for the spreading of goodwill and understanding among nations, rather than to poison the public mind and aggravate the differences ? Instances of this lack of understanding of the duty which the press owes to the public have been noticed before as regards the presentation of Persian affairs. The newspapers of Europe and America on many occasions have published fictitious and false news about our Government and our country. At times this erroneous information has smacked of ridicule, and has done little credit to the intelligence of its authors. Finally, may I be permitted to point out that the publication of such news by the foreign press only serves to harm its prestige and that of its country of origin in the eyes of Persia. The spreading of these falsehoods does not do any harm to our nation in the long run; but it unfortunately leaves a residue of ill- feeling' towards those who stoop to such methods. B M. A.
