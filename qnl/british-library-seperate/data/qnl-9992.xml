Jafar was eventually expelled from Kuwait on the basis of these allegations and the correspondence in the file discusses this and his subsequent return to the country.The majority of the correspondence in the file is between British officials of the Middle East Intelligence Centre in Cairo, the Political Agency in Kuwait and the Political Residency in Bushire.The file also contains copies of letters that were exchanged between Jafar and an Iraqi government official who was being held in a British internment camp following Britain's invasion and military occupation of Iraq in 1941. These letters are in Arabic and accompanied by English translations (folios 100-106).In addition to correspondence, the file also contains an April 1941 issue of
                           Radio Araba di Bari, the monthly magazine of the Italian Government's Arabic language radio station, Radio Bari (folios 64-81) and a translation of an article about Kuwait that was published in
                           al-Sayad, an Egyptian Arabic weekly magazine on 10 August 1948 (folio 119).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Aide-de-Camp and Private Secretary to the Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000d1#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000d1#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000d1#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000d1#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
