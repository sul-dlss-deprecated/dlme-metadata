You will remember* in tire converse case of the Sheikdoas subsidy (Foreign uffice reference S6981/983/91) the cost of which was borne wholly by the United Kingdom because of India's inability to pay, the charge was taken to India Office vote primarily because it was felt that the India Office would speak with most oonvicticn as to the inability of the Government of India to share a subsidy# No such consideration arises here and indeed were the Imperial share of the Honauz expenditure to be charged to India Office vote it might well be expeoted that that Department would find difficulty in speaking with any conviction as to the reasons for tire charge# L# B# Sherwood, Esq#, 0#B#E#, Foreign Office, Devonshire House, Mayfair, ¥#1# .a.■■■ 6925/45 13 July, 1&amp;45* Treasm^^ Refergr&gt;oe S 432 lo De°r Winiiifrith, I assume f iat matters arising out of the Hormuz salt contract, formerly dealt mth by Wilcox, are now your concern.

A claim for that store wrui preferred on the foreign Office a.vi their reply, of which I attach a cojy, is to the effect that dofehee of the exr)o ^diture cannot properly be undertaken by the Accounting Officer of the foreign Office. be find a little difficulty in accepting this sttitude* If any defence eT the charge in the Vote of* Credit Account is iieeded, it will surely have to be based, ot on India’s interest In the matter, which is dischargol by her payment of 50/, but ranlfiT#th^i-interetet which His ifcjosty's - Gcvernme t had in prcv®;ti g the Japanese from establishing a foot-licld on the direct line of c :^:imioation to Basarah and the Abadan oilfields. This is- primril^ a ForetOffice matter, as Basrali tmd Abadan are not witMa the India Office sphere. It seems to us, therefore, t at their interest goes far beyond that of a . observer, ant that in their oouinunicatioiie to Tehran (for e csnrple their telegram No. 182 of 10th iShy 1^2) they were not merely acting as a Post Office.

It is true that the 50/o of expenditure which His Majesty's Goveronent has agreed to accept as a charge to Imperial funds has now to be brought to aooount, presumably as a 'b' service of the Vote of Credit, but in our view this function falls S naturally to the India Office rather than the Foreign Office whose connexion with the transaction was simply that of an observer, and the channel of oasBunication with His Majesty's Ambassador at Tehran* The negotiations with the Treasury which resulted in the Government of India being relieved of half the expenditure were carried out entirely by the India Office, whose initiative and advocacy seems inevitably to entail responsibility for the defence of the expenditure. That defence obviously cannot with propriety be undertaken by the Accounting Officer of the Foreign Office: and it seems to follow that the item in question ought not to appear in the accounts of the Foreign Office.

You will have seen from Peel 's letter to Wilcox No. Ext.7058/42 of January 13th, a copy of which has been sent to you, that this latter question is still undecided.

The measure was designed to prevent the Japs from digging in at the mouth of the Gulf and consisted merely in securing the whole salt product of the Island. It was a precautionary measure thought wise in the light of strategical considerations and possible war developments, but if India has any sort of interest and responsibility for political matters in Persia, I should have thought she could not remain a disinterested spectator of infiltration tactics by the Japs in that part on purely political grounds. Moreover, in view of the small amount likely to be involved,. I should not personally have seen very much objection to it being taken to Suspense in India for adjustment after the war in the light of the general settlement between India and H.M.G. which will have to be negotiated then. I agree, of course, that we do not want to do anything to encourage H.M.G. to expect that we will share in the cost of military operations that may be necessary in Persia, and from this point of view I am not altogether easy at the decision of the Defence Department in India to accept the cost of * 'Constructing certain aerodromes in Persia. It is true that these are said to be necessary for the close border defence of India, but defence in these days can best be conducted at considerable distances from one’s frontiers and wars are- certainly best fought in other people’s territory. On these grounds it may not be easy for India to disclaim interest in operations conducted beyond the Indian.frontiers but perhaps these considerations do not apply with any particular force to the present case.■■■■■a Financial Secretarv. Honraxs Salt. Please see your note of October 2nd last and Treasury letter of October 24th*t ^ , &lt; 4 , . ei e-:. On receiving that letter, we arranged with the Foreign Office for H.M. li/iinister to be given the necessaiy instructions to negotiate with the Persian Government^for.tbe termination of the contract. This disposed of the urgent question, so far as action in London was concerned: bufe it left undecided the question (about which there is no hurry) of the incidence of the expenditure involved between H.M.G. and the Government of India. I agree with you that it would be a pity to make a first class issue out of a case where only a comparatively small sum of money is involved. But it seems to me that this case does raise, in a rather more clear cut form than ever before (so far as I am aware), an important and very controversial question of principle viz. whether India cooISr justifiably be asked to contribute to the cost of defence measures in the Persian Gulf. 'ofllS Oo '■ r • ' ? • O .-a* *; . J-; c ^ * It is true that this question was debated to some extent in the early days of the war in connection with the Persian Gulf Defence Schemes 3iut, as is shown by the £ir Ministry letter of October 18th 1939 (flagged ),controversy in fact arose only with regard to one item viz. the cost of the gift of arms and equipment to the Sultan of Muscat. Here the Government of India maintained that the whole cost should be borne by H.M.G., but the Air Ministry and the Treasury proposed instead that the arms etc. should be supplied from whatever source was most convenient, the question of the incidence of expenditure remaining open for discussion at the end of the war. The Government of India stood their ground (see their telegram No. 1949 of October 28 th 1939), -though they eventually agreed to a compromise^ solution whereby -che Air Ministry would pay for any stores supplied by India, while reserving the right to raise the question of incidence after the war (see P.Z.7038 and 7113/39). The Treasury subsequently agreed that India should charge the cost of such stores supplied by her to Indian Defence Expenditure after ultimate adjustment against H.M.G. under the 'flan, though the possibility still remains that after the war Infl-iA will be asked to pay something cm this account (see Treasury letter of July 1st 1940). Wt In that letter the Treasury remarked that in their view these gifts must he regarded in the same category as the political subsidies to the rulers in the Persian Gulf; and the political aspect of the gift to the Sultan had previously been advanced as an argument for asking India to bear a part of the cost (see the latter part of Mr, Gibson's minute at P.Z.59^39)• It is quite true that the gift of arms to the Sultan was more properly a 'political 1 ' than a 'defence- measure; and this consideration- increased the reluctance which I should in ary case feel in au&amp;oorSSn&amp;e- with the assumption in the Treasury letter of October 2ifth that the arrangement made with regard to the cost of that gift is &amp; valid argument for asking India to share the cost of the Hormuz Salt contract, which is purely 'defence' expenditure. There is no doubt much to be said in support of the view that India should make some contribution to the cost of defence measures in the Persian Gulf-3ut while there seems no need at the moment to enter into the pros and cone cf this controversy^ I feel that it should he on this issue, and on it alone, that we should go hack to the Government of India with a request for a reconsideration of their attitude with regard to Hormuz Salt expenditure• In their letter of October 2ifth however the Treasury dift not deal with the question on the ground of principle, but produce^ a number of narrow arguments which, as I have endeavoured to show in the draft, all seem more or less unsound. Hence I think it may simplify matters in the long run if at this stage we make an attempt to secure from the Treasury either a reconsideration of their refusal to pay the whole cost,or some / better mterial with which to go hack to the Government of India. Do you concur in the draft?principle that this expenditure v/as justly shariable between the two Government^ • In that paragraph Gibson \vas referring to paragraph 3 of the Government of Indian telegram No. 2111 of May 9th 19M (a copy of which was enclosed in his letter), from which he deduced that it was clearly their view that any loss resulting frcra the contract should be at least shared by H.M.G.

You also refer to the Government of India’s acceptance as a charge on Indian Revenues of of the cost of certain wartime subsidies to the . Sill tan of Muscat. In ny letter to Compton No.P.Z.72W39 ^ November 24th 1939, which related to these subsidies, I said that it had been cur contenticn that defence expenditure in the Gulf falls into a different category from the regular political expenditure. We still maintain this view. /I ^ ; . - 5 . Lastly, you refer to the agreement whereby , H.M.G. reserved the right to-raise after the war &gt; Xli&gt; ^ the question of the incidence of the cost of the arms and equipment given to the Sultan of Muscat, which was met from Imperial Revenues in the first instance. This agreement related only to the gift to the Sultan and not, as your letter implies, to defence expenditure in the Gulf area generally. Your letter to Grist No.S.45336 of July 1st 1940 „ said that, in the Treasury's view, these gifts must be regarded in the same category as the ^ political subsidies to,the rulers in the Persian * ■ ; - r Gulf./Gulf* We agree that the gift of anas to the Sultan Yra .3 a ,, political ,, measure as much as, or more than, a 'defence' measure; and we therefore consider that the expenditure involved is in a somewhat different category from defence expenditure properly so called. . Apart from this, we do not feel that the arrangement governing thia expenditure^ which was made under pressure of urgent military requirements^ affords a valid precedent for asking India to share the cost of the Hormuz Salt contract ,o which is purely defence expenditure. fk-UA fcR We-hopa that^^-in the light of thesa aajguraotenees^ i ^ r UA_ /r\(AA(Uj) O- the Treasury will feel able to. . &lt; . . &amp;ujhCctyr^tt^ OAinwCU^v/ CctJt agree that the whole of the expenditure involved in ^ ^ r ; t ^ ^ this contract may be borne upon Imperial Revenues. 2wM&lt;k.

We assume that the Government of India will now take the necessary steps accordingly. We are sorry to see that the India Office suggest a departure from the arrangement made between the two Depart ments in 1941 that the expenditure in connection with the extension of the contract should be treated as special war time expenditure in the Persian Gulf, the allocation of which between H.M.G. and the Government of India would be reserved for decision after the war. In our view it was clearly implied in the third paragraph of Gibson^ letter of the 14th May, 1941, that the Government of India also could be ass\ped to be in agreement in principle that the expenditure was justly shareable between the two Governments. At that time the Government of India had already accepted the charge to Indian revenues of 55% of the cost of certain war-time subsidies to the Sultan of Muscat (see your letter P.Z.6101/39 of 9th October, 1939, to Hale here), and though India subsequently contended that the supply of arms to the Sultan and other defence expenditure in the Gulf area generally should be charged in full to H.M.G., the Defence Departments and the Treasury did not accept that position but reserved their right to take the expenditure in question - which on military grounds could not be held up for a decision on incidence of charge - into consideration in any settlement at a later date (see Treasury semi-official letter of l 6 th November, 1939* to Air Ministry, a copy of which was sent to you at the time, and mv l etter of 1st July, 1940, to Grist under India Office 3 p eference numbe r P.? 664 / 40 ). . ^1,942 It seems to us that the Government of India are now in PeeT, Nsq., M.G., India Office. thethe converse situation in the matter of this contract, , which has been administered by them throughout, and w trust therefore that you and they will now agree that the remaining expenditure in connection with it, including^^a involved in its liquidation, should be defrayed from Ind a* revenues, subject to any reservations the Government of In feel bound to make as regards the final incidence of cha g .

Although they are not directly relevant to the present pi''*; case, you may care to glance through the papers between flags A Ik), and B (excluding of course those about salt). It is interesting to note Mr. Hallett*s statement, reported in my letter to the Foreign Office No.Ext.3152/4-1 of the 23rd June, 1941 &gt; that there did not seem to be a market for red oxide in India. More relevant are U.K.C.C. telegram to Tehran No.394 Encom of March 9th last and Tehran telegram to the Government of India No f 440 of September 16th, especially the latter. The point at issue between Stricks and the Persian Government may well be that whereas under the contract (which expired on June 30th, 1941) Stricks were to pay ohe-third of the price on signature of the contract and the remaining ’two-thirds when the oxide was shipped, the Persians ask&lt;§d for the balance of the payment as soon as the contract expired, notwithstanding that Stricks had not found it possible to ship the whole amount. However this may be, Mr. Hallett told me that Stricks were not disposed to yield to the Persian demands, since they thought that any concessions on their part would only lead to further claims. The present position is apparently that the Persians will not allow the balance of the oxide to be shipped until their demands sire met. Stricks on the other hand are anxious to ship the oxide to India, where buyers are waiting for it. I do not think Mr. Hallett told me whether they anticipate difficulty in securing shipping space from Hormuz to India. It appears that the Indian buyers, impatient at the delay, approached the Government of India, who in turn made enquiries of the Tehran Legation. The reply was simply that the Persian Government would not allow the oxide to be shipped. Stricks have since heard a report from India that the buyers wish to cancel their order. UjW' Mr. Hallett says that the oxide is urgently required in Ind ia for paint making and that it can be ob tained from no other source than fformuz. Prom these two factsy^he deduces that the Government of India have not simply been acting as a post office4M* -2 I*'' ' i* ■■ j i r W V&gt; ... r , K * 'V** i / on behalf of the Indian buyers, but have themselves been negotiating for the purchase of the oxide on their own account. • To me these deductions seemed unwarrantable, but Mr. Hallett / seemed very sure that they were correct. He is wiring to Strides 1 representative in Tehran for confirmation that the Persian Government are firm in their refusal to allow shipment of the oxide. He hopes to have the reply by 12 noon on Monday when he is coming to see you. I will also be there. Perhaps it would be well to find out from-Colonel Peckston of the U*K.C.C. what dealings they have had with Mr. Hallett. The letter from Mr. Grant” of the Treasury of June 28th, 1941, on this file suggests that his complaints may not always be well founded. fr/ft-L Munkpi mm, \ .

Hormuz salt. 2* Object of this contract was stated in paragraph 4 of Foreign telegram No. 2111/90 dated 9th May# From commercial angle it was bound to be unprofitable and we are now satisfied that even if shipping could be made available price of salt in India would not cover cost of transport. Government of India propose therefore to leave salt at Hormuz until buyer can be found, and if there is no buyer then to abandon it. 3. Do you consider Persian Government would accept arrangement to extinguish contract on receiving payment for total of 150,000 tons at 3 dollars per ton less mining cost on condition (a) that salt is not sold outside Persia during next two years (b) no contract is made with tnird party for* working and exporting salt from Hormuz during the war? 3 ISSUE OF THE ABOVE HAS BEEN AUTHORISED. Joint Secretary to the Government of India. ^fe/ 8 .Secretary. 1 Department. The stoiy of the contract made by H.M. Minis ter at 4pA Tehran, for the purchase by the Government of India of salt &lt;,/ from the island of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, is summarised ' in Mr, Gibson's letter to the Treasury of May 14th, 1941 (flagged). The contract itself is at Ext. 2 * 461 / 42 . You will see that when the Government of India referred the matter to H.M.G., as described in paragraph 3 of Mr. Gibson's letter, they spoke of the 'probable commitment on your account' (paragraph 3 of their telegram No. 2111 of May 9th). This phrase is not entirely free from ambiguity; though it was no doubt guessed here that the Government of India expected H.M.G, to bear the whole loss resulting from the marketing of the salt in India. The Treasury, however, would go no further than to propose that any loss incurred should be classed as special wartime expenditure in the Persian Gulf; and at the same time they asked for fuller information of the financial commitments involved. Presumably what the Treasury wanted to Imow was, not how much the Government of India xvould have to pay the Persians for the salt (the price per ton and the approximate quantity were already known), but the estimated amount of the loss which would be incurred in marketing it. It looks as if the Government of India have a case when they argue| f in their letter of March 23rd below, that that the expenditure involved should be borne in full by H.M.G., and not classed as special wartime expenditure. But we can hardly ask the Treasury to accept an indefinite commitment; and it is therefore proposed to go back to the Government of India for the information for which we asked them over a year ago. Do you concur in the draft? &lt;yExt. 2710/42, The Secretary to The Government of India, External Affairs Department.

This contract fs the result of a great deal of extra work by the Commercial Secretary to this Legation and the success f with which he has, in my opinion, been able to safeguard so compltely the interests of the Government of India reflects on him the great est credit. 3. The principal points of importance are as follows Article 1 provides that the Government of India will purchase up to 100,000 tons of salt during the years 1941 and 1942. As this figure represents more than the maximum output which is likely to be achieved, this provision secures the complete elimination of the Japanese as stipulated in Your Lordship’s telegram ITo. 90 of May 9th last. The price for the first year is that agreed to by the Government of India, namely the rupee equivalent of United Mtates dollars 3 per ton; for the second year, by agreement 9 months after signature of the contract. Article 4 provides that in the event of production falling below a rate of 10,000 - 12,500 tons per month the Government of India will agree to accept delivery of smaller quantities. Similarly it is stated that while the Iranian Government will endeavour to load up to 600 tons per day, they undertake that the minimum to be loaded will be 400 tons. Article 5 arranges methods of payment which I trust will prove sa tisfactory. Article 6 provides for modification or continuation of the contract by agreement after 18 months. 4 # with the existing installations at Hormuz the production is not likely to reach 50,000 tons for the first year, and follow ing completion of the new installations the production will not exceed 100,000 tons, consequently the word 'total' In referring to production was not used. 5 # As it will be necessary for the Government of India to airooint a representative to supervise the weighing, loading and shipment of salt, and to assist the master of the ship calling, I aunroached the firm of S. Lorabjee &amp; Bon who are the agents of Messrs. Frank Strick and supervise the loading of red oxide from Hormuz. They are fully conversant with conditions and are suitable in every way to watch and protect the interests of the Government of India. 6 .

Dear Coverley-Price, I refer to yoizr letter of the 4th July (E.3477/67/34) about the shipment of Hormuz red oxide to the U. S, A. We fully appreciate your desire that the new contract v/ith the Iranian Government should be completed, but it seems to us that, in the first instance, we must be clear (i) as to whether the material is in fact considered by the Americans to be an essential import into the U. 3*A.; and if not - (ii) whether you regard the purchase of this material as essential on either political or pre-emptive grounds. So far as (i) is concerned, this would involve the provision of shipping space to the U.S.A., but as no vessels under our control are at present on this route, the Ministry of War Transport obviously cannot give you the assurance for which you ask. As I explained to Talbot in my letter of the 30th June, there are American vessels returning from the Middle East to the United States, and Strick’s should make every effort to find space on those vessels through commercial channels, but I gather from your letter under reply that you are not satisfied that Strick’s have exhausted this possibility. If, However, further efforts in this direction are unsuccessful, we could approach the Americans with a view to ascertaining whether they regard this red oxide as an /essential A. V.

You sent us a copy of your letter of June 23rd to Talbot about the alleged difficulties of Strick Sc Company. The only difficulty which interested me was the allegation that “the Treasury will not allow sterling payments to the Iranians’'. I promptly rang up Mr. Hallett to ask him for details of any applications to transfer money to Iran which had been refused, either by the bankers or by the Treasury. Mr. Kallett explained that he had not yet made application but that the last application had been very much delayed before going though. I.said I was sorry to hear about the delay but if he would give me particulars I would certainly investigate the matter. He said he did not particularly want to bother about questions v/hich were over and done with; all he was concerned with was future payments. I told him to apply through his bankers and to let me know if there was any trouble. The allegation put out by Mr. Hallett that sterling payments were not allowed is of course p£re rubbish; I think all he is concerned with is finding an excuse for not paying. We should allow sterling to go to Iran for any genuine commercial transantion and certainly in a case of this sort where there were strong reasons. We do of course take a very strong line about not allowing any casual dollar payments to Iran; I should explain that the reason for our E.W. R. Lumby, Esq., India Office. /strongstrong line on dollar payments is that we give an extremely liberal ration of dollars already. ♦ I hope there will he no further trouble on the question of sterling payments. If any suggestions of this sort are made, it is always useful to ask for. details at once; if a grievance is genuine (as it may he) it can he remedied quickly, and if it is not genuine the allegation is exploded.

As I understand it, tne posi cion is that he has a contract with the l&amp;nistry of Mines in Tehran for the purchase of red oxide against payment in sterling. This contract expires very soon, but a considerable amount oi the oxide wiiich it covers has not yet been shipped owing to the difficulty ox obtaining shipping space. Stricky have today had a cable from thet^representative in Tehran to say that he:has been informed by the Ministry of Mines that if they do not forthwith receive payment of the sum due to them under the contract they will '-^ake appropriate measures' or some such phrase.

These obstacles are two (a) The Treasury will no it allow them to make sterling payments to the Iranians. (b) They cannot get shipping space. % Apparently they can sell red oxide either in the U.lh or in the U.S. but, as they have been refused import licences for the former ; they are concentrating on the latter.

I asked Mr. Hallett whether he could dispose of tnis substance (which is used mainly for paint making; in India, but he replied Jiat there did not seem to be a market for it there. Some days ago you told me that you were getting the D.O.T. i*vi£ l&amp;wj* wth to /3tricks on this subject* All the D.O.T. seem to have done is to suggest to the U.K.C.C* that they should talk to otricks. U.K.C.C. have mentioned the matter to Stricks in a vague sort of way, referring to it as 'red ochre from Ira^ 1 '. Strides do not like to say too much to U.K.C.C., since they wish if possible ‘bo keep the business themselves and regard the Corporation as a potential competitor. I did not of course mention to Mr. Hallett the telegrams from Tehran and India, but I told him that I would ring him up as soon as possible. Would you please let me know whether the Foreign Office would be prepared to approach (a) the Treasury in order to overcome the ^Exchange fiontrol difficulty^ and (b) the Ministry of War Transport for help in providing shipping. you will have seen from Tehran telegram to India Iio.224 of June 12th that the contract for the nurchase bv the Government oi India oi the Hormuz sa.lt has been oigned. As it is already some time since we received the telegrams about the red oxide (Sir 1?.

Reference Government of India’s telegram of 9th May, repeated to you No. 90, Hormuz Salt. You are authorised to xtend offer for a second year and if absolutely necessary for a third year. If this offer is not accepted and an attempt made to secure better terms you should discourage it and say that you must consult me further. You can, of course, make play with the dangers to the Iranian Government if the Japanese are given any contract and allowed to gain a foothold on the Island. 2. I an assuming you aro satisfied that Japanese pressure in this case is genuine, and that the whole matter is not a try-on on the parrt of the lersians. Ha Ait.ECONOMIC &amp; OVERSEAS DEPARTMENT Mr. Rayner The question of 'buying 100,000 tons per annum of rock salt mined on Hormuz Island, in the Persian Gulf, is under consideration in order to prevent the Japanese obtaining a concession on the Island. The sanction of the Treasury is necessary for this transaction, and a telegram will have to go to Tehran today. The Treasury will doubtless want to know what are the prospects of a loss arising on the transaction. It is proposed to buy the salt at the rupee equivalent of 3 dollars per ton. Can you say - (a) whether there is a market for rock salt in India. If so, what salt might we be replacing with Hormuz salt? (b) How does the price at which rock salt can be sold in India compare with the price of the rupee equivalent of 3 dollars f.o.b. Hormuz? (c) Do you know anything about the quality of Hormuz rock salt? NSjjS'' Mr. Rumbold, I am afraid we haven*t much information about Rock Salt. According to the Tariff Board Report of 1930 on Salt, Rock salt was at than time imported in very small quantities from Hamburg, and was said to be used in religious ceremonies and also to some extent for cattle. Crushed rock salt was also imported from Roumania. The only rock salt produced in India is that quarried in the mines in the Punjab and the N. W.F.P. Imports from Hamburg of salt averaged some 35,000 tons a year in the two years immediately receding the war; but there is nothing to indicate how much of this was rock salt. Imports from Roumania appear to hav ceased altogether in recent years. Thus it would appear that the only salt any from■ E.m3 4] m vVith tho Com; ‘t* * of the HJwdar Secretary of State for Foreign [Cypher] ' ETiO lot r'5 FROM TEHRAN TO G-OVLRNI;iENT OF INDIA. Wo .

(375/2/41) British Legat; Tehran. 21st March, 1941. •m* My Lord Marquess, I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 209 of 1st October, 1940, and Your Lordship*s reply No. 145 o f 19th October, 1940, regarding rock salt from Hormuz, and to inform Your Lordship that the Jap anese appear to be showing great interest in Ho rmuz.~'fn ey heTve recently bought considerable quantities of rock salt and sent a geologist and two engineers to the island ostensibly to supervise delivery; and it is now learned that they have submitted an offer to the Ministry of Finance for exclusive rights for salt-mining on Hormuz. 2. The Ministry of Finance share the doubts which I feel as to whether this rather sudden interest by the Japanese in the island of Hormuz is in fact purely in regard to the salt mines and they are therefore procrastinating in the matter of the Japanese offer. It would certainly seem highly undesirable that the Japanese should establish themselves on Hormuz and I have reason to believe that this could be prevented if we were to show an interest in Hormuz salt. Since it appears that India is not interests in rock salt I have the honour to suggest for Your Lordship*s consideration the desirability of forming a small Iranian or Irano- Indian Company for the purpose of refining the rock salt ~ ^ re ttu-j on the island and to replace importing this refined salt ' into India. If this were found practicable I feel AttA. W ». fairly certain that it would be possible to secure the exclusion of the Japanese from the island. 3. As it is likely that the Japanese will press the Ministry of Finance for an early answer to the proposal I have the honour to request that I may be furnished by telegraph with Your Lordship*s views on the scheme outlined in the preceding paragraph.

The file includes a copy of the contract (in French) agreed between the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Iran, and the British Legation at Tehran, dated 9 June 1941, for the purchase of salt on Hormuz by the Government of India (ff 82-86). Much of the subsequent correspondence concerns the expenditure of the contract. The file also includes discussion of Frank C Strick &amp; Company’s concession for red oxide production at Hormuz. The file’s principal correspondents are: HM Ambassador to Iran, Reader William Bullard; the External Affairs Department of the Government of India; the Foreign Office.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
