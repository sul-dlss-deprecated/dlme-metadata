FOREIGN OFFICE,S.H 12th March 19S6. Sir You will have seen, from the correspondence printed copies of which were enclosed in my despatch No.21 of the 17th January, that the Iraq Petroleum Company have formed a new Company, to be known as Petroleum Concessions Limited, for the purpose of acquiring oil concessions in certain areas in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere; and you will be aware, from the memorandum of the 20th January a copy of which was enclosed in my deapatch No.24 of the 23rd January, of the general policy which that Company propose to follow. 2. The Company have now furnished His Majesty’s Government with particulars of the offers which they propose to make to the various rulers of the Persian Gulf, for concessions, in their respective territories, and these proposals have now been considered by the various departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned* The majority of them present no serious difficulty; but a somewhat more complicated situation arises as regards the proposals which the new company contemplate making to the Shaikh of Kuwait. His Majesty’s Government have already given permission to the company to approach the Shaikh with a view to securing an option over his rights in the neutral zone, but the Company have now asked for permission to approach His Excellency with a view to negotia ting a concession , in so far as his own rights are concerned, on the lines of the enclosed draft. 3. As you know, the situation as regards the grant of any oil concession in this area has been greatly complicated by the grant by King Ibn Saud, in aspect of his own rights over the / Sir Andrew Ryan,KBE.,CMG., £ O • 9 61 (I • f J eddam % ^ - 2 - the zone, of an option to the Standard Oil Company of California to acquire on equal terms any concession for which an offer may be made. If then Petroleum Concessions Limited acquires, not only a similar option, but an actual concession, from the Shaikh of Kuwait, in respect of his rights, the effect may well be to perpetuate the present deadlock and to render even more remote the prospects of any agreed concession being granted to a single company by both rulers and of any oil in the ere® being actually exploited. It may be, therefore, that King Ibn Saud might resent the action of His Majesty’s Government in giving their fonnal approval to the present proposal of Petroleum Concessions Limited, i.e. in allowng the ohaiKh ol Kuwait, who can give no oil concession without their consent, to negotiate with Petroleum Concessions Limited on the basis proposed. 4. On the other hand, were Petroleum Concessions Limited to acquire this concession, the result might be to prevent a further potentially important area in Arabia from faliing under the exclusive commerciel control of an entirely non—British company. As you know, the Kuwait neutral zone falls within the so-called Red Line agreement, so that the constituent groups of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and therefore of Petroleum Concessions Limited, are precluded from competing individually for a concession therein. No other serious British company is likely to be able successfully to take up or exploit any concession ip this area, and the only possibility of securing at least partial British participation in such an oil concession therefore seems to lie in the present proposal. The grant to Petroleum Concessions Limited of a definite concession over this area, insofar as his own rights were concerned, by the Shaikh of Kuwait might indeed effectively remove the danger of the Standard Oil Company of California /-3 California ever obtaining an exclusive concesaion for themselves over it, and the ultimate result might be some compromise between the two companies, which would bring about the termination of the present deadlock, ensure the effective exploitation of any oil that might be found in the zone, and, at the same time, prevent the area from falling under exclusive American commercial control, 5. In all the circumstances His Majesty f s Government are disposed to view sympathetically the present proposal of Petroleum Concessions Limited, but before considering it further they wish to know whether, in your opinion, their approval of it would be likely to produce an adverse political reaction from King Ibn Saud. This aspect of the question is naturally of importance at a time when so many delicate and difficult political questions are outstanding between His Majesty^s Government and Saudi Arabia, particular- ly in regard to the south-eastern, and to the Transjordan, frontiers of that Kingdom, I shall be glad therefore if you will let me have a brief expression of your views by telegraph.

Lorrim&amp; says in regard to their ownership:- Arabi• n The question of ownership has never arisen and there is 'apparently no reason for regarding it as the property of 'one territorial power rather than of another”. Farsi. 'The ownership of the Island, like thau of nrabi, appears 'to be undetermined'. 3 # The word Farsi is of course Arabic for 'Persian' and Arab! means '’'Arab 11 • Farsi is slightly nearer the Iranian Coast than Arabi, which may account - or naming them so, without being attributive of ov/nership.2 UJ 4 # I^rom most discreet enquiries here I rind there is no suspicion that they may be particularly valuable for Oil thereabouts and no disposition to regard either Island as belonging to any of the surrounding states. They or rather the area about them is frequented by Kuwaiti pearlers more than anyone else. 5. At first sight it would seem to this *»gency desirable to establish their ownership, by claiming them for King Sdward, or by intimating to Kuwait (or Bahrain) that she may do so, or otherwise; and for this reason I have the honour to write to you in case you find that some such action is in fact now desirable.

I will take your three questions seriatim. (i) The Iraq Petroleum Company (or, as it was then known, the Turkish Petroleum Company) Group Agreement of 1928 - known as the 'Red Line Agreement' - as you know drew a red line round Arabia and Asia Minor but left out Kuwait and the Farsan I slams. Bahrain was included within the area. In regard to Kuwait in particular the definitions appended to the map which accompanied the agreement state that the red line is intended to follow 'the limit of the territorial waters of the Arabian Peninsula excepting the Sultanate of Kuwait and the Farsan Islands Archipelago'. As the Neutral Zone had already been constituted when this Agreement was entered into, it was assumed by the Iraq Petroleum Company - an assumption that has not been disputed - that the Neutral Zone is not, in so far as the Red Line Agreement is concerned, part of the 'Sultanate of Kuwait', and therefore lies with in the area covered by that Agreement. This is the accepted view. (ii) The D'Arcy Exploration Company Limited is a subsidiary company of the Anglo-Iranian&gt;b ricfe^ IIjjO il'X92 U) 100*10 ^100*1 xloni sq nl i ad3 tit lo ninoq j” bns airij - 0102 SB fH08 2 B ^ exit rl.t ni t nBxH ws'ibnA u .sbbsT, - 2 - Oil Company. It has a small nominal capital, fully owned by the latter company. I understand that tne subsidiary company usually does all the preliminary negotiations as regards options and concessions, but any subsequent exploitation is entrusted to the parent company - i.e. the Anglo-Iranian w il Company, which in turn under the Red Line Agreement must offer to the Iraq Petroleum Company any concessions it may acquire within the red line area. (iii) With regard to Oil in Muscat, the Sultan undertook by an agreement with us of February 1923 not to exploit any oil which might be found in his territories or to grant permission for its exploita tion without prior consultation with the Political Agent and the approval of the Government of India. 2 . As to Philby 1 s article in the Egyptian Gazette of the 14 th January; there does not seem much harm in it though there is a slight sting in its tail. actual fact it is only in connexion with the Qatar frontier that Philby might, if he wanted to, charge us with any ulterior motives in the matter of frontier delimitation. The only ot ier territories marching with Saudi Arsbia are Abu Dhabi and Muscat, and there seems no great prospect of oil being looked for at any distance from the coastal belt. iFrom To Repeated Kuwait.

Skliros has now sent me a copy oljhis letter to you of April 21st. 2* I 1 ^ nd that there hps unfortunately been some delay in sending you copies of our most recent papers on the subject, and I now enclose (1) a copy of a record of a conversation I had with Skliros on this subject on April 17th, (2) an extract from a letter which Skliros wrote to me on the same evening on this point, and (o) a note of a further conversation which I had with Skliros on April 20th and vhioh has obviously led to his letter of April 21st to you. You have already received, under cover of our printed letter ao.E. 1998/260/91 of April 17tn, a copy of Ryan’s telegram No.46 of April 14th. 3 . You will eeethat I made it quite clear to aicliros that there would be no objection from the Foreign Office point of view to hi3 going ahead with negotiations with the Shaikh of Kuwait for an o£tion in respect of the Shaikh’s rights over the Neutral Zone, but that we should m uch prefer that ne should not at this Staee neS ° tlate &amp;n a ° tUal cono ® s 3ion.

Skliros added tliat ne was not unhopeful of being enabled eventually to conclude some kind of agreement with the Stand- » ard Oil Company ofCalifornia about the Zone. Hitherto that Company’s terms for any cession of their option oh Ibn oaud’a rights had been exorbitant and they had demanded a 4Q?S share in any new Company rtiich might be formed by Petroleum Con cessions Limited to exploit the Zone. As Petroleum Conces sions Limited already contain (as the Iraq Petroleu^ompany) a 23.75 U.S.inteiffit the effect of this would have been to produce a U.S. majority holding in the new Compahy, to which Skliros 9 s Company naturally could not agree. 3ut he was inclined to think that although the Standard ^il Company ol California had exaggerated ideas as to the value of the oil in the Zone and had opened their mouths very wide at the outset, they might well prove more reasonable later on. 5. I think the present solution fully meets the point raised in Hyan's telegram So.46, and there is therefore no further objection from the Foreign Office point of view to your authorising Petroleum Concessions limited to go ahead. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Sunn at the Petroleum Department, to Seal at the Admiralty and to Farrer at the Department of Overseas Trade. lours sincerely, sd.

OIL CONCESSION IN ARABIA. Kuwait Neutral 4one. At the end of a conversation with me this morning on the question of the proposed Saudi Arabian Ked Sea Littoral Oil Concession - which 1 am recording separately - Mr.Skliros of the Iraq Petroleum Company raised the question of the proposed oil concession in the Kuwait Neutral ^one. 2. He explained that Mr. Idlibi had now informed him that he had actually acquired a concession - or at any rate an option - from King I bn Saud over the Kuwait Neutral ^one, in so far as Ibn Saud’s own rights therein were concerned. Mr.Ydlibi had further asserted that he had obtained a promise from the Shaikh of Kuwait of the grant of a similar concession, or option, on identic terms, in respect of his rights. Mr. Ydlibi was very categorical in his statements and was now offering the con cession, or option, to the I.P.C. 3. I replied that Mr. Ydlibi’s interest in the Kuwait Neutral Zone was well known to us, but that the position, as far as we knew it, still was that the Standard Oil Company of California already held an option from King Ibn Saud in respect of the latter's rights over the Neutral Zone, and that any negotiations for any alternative concession, or option must necessarily be in the first instance with the Standard Oil Company of California rather than with the King. As regards the Shaikh of Kuwait’s rights, the Shaikh w a s precluded by his agreements with His Majesty’s Government from granting any concession without our approval. It seemed to me therefore, that there must be some mistake. 4. Mr.Skliros agreed and explained that he had Just been in touch with the India Office in the matter, with a view to ascertaining /C Q 2 - •xqoo ■&amp;) &amp;y .(ie\ods\Vdos a) ; ascertaining whether His Majesty’s (iovernment had in fact I JIO abandoned, in favour of Mr. fdiioi, tne veto wmcn tney nad ruH hitherto maintained against the grant by the Shaikh of Kuwait O A 10 1)0 9 9rid“ ^ A on any concession, or option, in respect of his rights in the aoqoTQ *io no i 39 up Zone. The India Office had confirmed that nothing of the sort e ^ itoi/fw - no iBEsonoO had happened. moO ciiJsIoUe^ p.9il sri* 5. Mr^Skliros was, however, most anxious to proceed with end- ni noisesonoo Ilo immediate negotiations with the Shaikh of Kuwait for the grant d-jBxid- beni-Blqxe 9il ,2 of a five-year option in respect ofthe Shaikh’s rights in the i&gt;jsn Neutral Zone. He understood from the India Office that there 9 vo iDLaS ndZ sciiX kqiJ would be no objection to this, but what were our views? atrigi'i nvvo s’Jbn^S ncfl 6. I said that a telegram on the question had recently come darid- bs^iseea 19x1^ul in which I had not yet had time to study. I thought I could tnais exl d !o JIjswuX lo say pretty definitely, however, that there would be no objection jB9*i ni «8xnv9j- oid-nabi to the I.P.C. obtaining an option for five years from the s^a eirl nx laoxfosa^ao Shaikh of Kuwait. There might, however, be more serious objections to an actual concession. Mr.Skliros explained t noi^qo 10 ,noxs :so that all that the Company were now seeking was an option only. m d-and- bsxXgei I *5 They proposed to leave the question of a concession, and of Hew anw ano^ laidiieT! the terms of any eventual concession, entirely open for the :de t di wens! «w eg ial time being. Would there be any objection from His Majesty’s ^b«9Tla axnio'iilBO 'io Government to their seeking an option? I replied that I ledd’Bl erf* Jo doeqeei thought that there would be none, but that I should like to ; to! eaoxdBidosoa VP&amp; look into the question further before being absolutely cate- li od ^Ix^Baesosn d-enm gorical. It was eventually agreed that Mr.Skliros should [olilaO Jo y;nBqmoO li^ return &amp;t midday on Monday to discuss the question further. Jo x1&gt;11bi 1S 9Xld ebissev 7. Mr.Skliros added that the terms of any concession in the Jiw Bd-nenreenaa eiri ^ Kuwait Neutral Zone had presented considerable difficulty, JJOXld - XW T noi r ;890nOO '{OB particularly as a proposal had been strongly pressed that these eoe sd dsum sverfd terms should be on a gold basis.

I have also to report some movement in connection with the Kuwait Neutral Zone area. Regarding the half rights belonging to the Shaikh of Kuwait, our negotiator in the Persian Gulf has been told not at present to address himself to the Shaikh and is, of course, abstaining from donng so. As regards Ibn Saud^ half rights, we learn from Mr. Jans on that Ydlibi is endeavouring to secure these from Ibn ^aud on terms of which Mr.Janson has informed us in outline. We consider these terms, if correctly reported, to be excessively high and we particularly dislike the obligation to pay large sums in gold, a metal of which we have hitherto been able to avoid the mention in our dealings in Eastern Arabia, i'he terms apparently being offered by Ydlibi to Ibn Saud are much higher than those we had proposed (if and fchen allowed to do so) to offer to the Shaikh of Kuwait. *e are, therefore, informing the Arabian Development indicate that we are not buyers of the Neutral Zone rights which they may have obtained from Ibn Saud on exhorbitant terms involving gold payments; nor is Ydlibi directly or indirectly acting for us in connec tion with the Neutral Zone. 8. One result, however, of high demands by Ibn ^aud for his half rights may well be that we shall feel it best to content ourselves with an option (as opposed to a concession) to be obtained from the Shaikh of Kuwait for his half. That we should thus confine ourselves has already been the unofficial advice of the India Office to us. May we anticipate that if the India Office give us permission to negotiate such an option for the Shaikh*s rights over the Neutral ^one, the peculiar circumstances of that territory from your point of view will not prevent us from obtaining these limited rights at the Kuwait end ?.Ue\0ds\s5is s) raoTl CT inusloi^a^) Copy.

He explained that the Standard Oil Company of California had already a definite option from Ibn Saud as regards the latter’s rights in the Neutral 2one, and that if the Company were now to obtain a concession from the Shaikh, it would complicate matters for us vis a vis Ibn Saud. In response to Mr.Ski ires* enquiry as to whether we knew for certain or only from hearsay of the existence of this option, Mr.Rendel told Mr.Skliros confidentially that we had the text of the agreement in question (see annex to the record of the 6th and 7th meetings with Euad Hamza at the Foreign Office on September 25th 1934 . E 6018/25 -} and that he could take it from him that the option existed. Mr.Skliros here expressed astonishment that Ydlibi should have been so categorical in his statement that he had the promise of a concession in the Neutral Zo&gt;ne from Ibn ^aud, provided of course that he had come to terms with the Shaikh of Kuwait. To this Mr.Rendel replied that Sir Andrew Ryan had reported (Jedda telegram No.46 in E 1996) that Ydlibi was fully aware of the existence of this option and had confessed to Sir Andrew Ryan that he had not a clear idea as to how Ibn Saud would settle with the American Company. 2. Mr*Skiiros finally said that he would inform the India Cd'i'ic© that the Company would go ahead for an option as agreed to in Mr.Walton’s letter to him of December 12th (E 7262/459/91).

Sir, I have the honour to say that His Bxoeilenoy the Shaikh again mentioned the Neutral Zone option today# He had received a private massage from ^ajor Holmes on his way through by air last week that he hoped to be allowed to approach him on his return. 2. The Shaikh commenting on the message said that he was most unlikely to change his earlier decision not to grant an option. 3. His reasons are political in that he maintains that the Zone should all of it belong to Kuwait and may yet do so, and secondly that it is impracticable to work a concession in the Neutral Zone; to divide oil may be possible but how to divide the Law and its Officers equally he asked. 4.

OPTION is translated as KHIAR v/hich means cucumber. It is true that the dictionary gives KKIM* for both 'choice' and 'cucumber' but local usage hereabouts is for it to mean cucumber. Option should have been translated as 'HA^Q AL IKHTEaR', an expression in currency everywhere.

Agreement on lines of enclosure to your despatch would appear to constitute option with right to eventual concession rather than actual concession; it is not clear whether it would bring into operation first alternative in Standard Oil Company of California’s option nesdbea in my telegram No. 95 of 1934. 3. Assuming however that proposed agreement would constitute concession witnin the meaning of Standard Oil Company’s option acceptance oy Standard Oil Company of equal terms in regard to Saudi Arabian Government interest would make deadlock more complete tnan ever; refusal would eliminate Standard Oil Company but in this alternative Ibn Sand might well consider Yalibi group had first claim. 4. Language used by Yalibi group in discussion with Petroleum Concessions Limited (see enclosure to your despatch No.b4) might be held to imply that they haa disinterested themselves in neutral zone. This is by no means the case.

Political Resident, Bushire No. C-208 Dated Kuwait, the 10th June 19 256 KUWAIT NLUTRcxL OPriQK. / v Reference your Printed letter 10.486-8 of 6th June 1936, enclosing copy of Foreign Office telegram No.59, dated \ V w ' the 5th June 1936 I am of the opinion that sane sort of understanding about the future of the Oil development of the Neutral Zone may and almost certainly does exist between Ibn 5aud and the Shaikh of Kuwait. This I deduce from the Irmness of the shaikh vis a vis Petroleum Concessions Limited recently, from his several references at the same time to the excellence of his relationship just now with Ibn Baud which he did not wish to tions with the zhaikh immediately after they took place which pointed to the seme conclusion. I am doubtful however of its na tire. One may, I suppose, safely assume that ibn Sand’s 3 greatest need at the moment is very large sum of money, not only to keep going but to mechanize his foi wes and form a s standing army and air force, in view of the fact that the impetus of fanaticism on which he has relied largely is now dying away and has recently, only just across the Red Sea from him, been shown to be helpless against a modem army While here Ibn Baud, in the Political Agency^onoy, imlt forth at aosm about 'lie aaarloaar he ring ot&gt;t*la»a the ;iaaa to^aaaiaa aot heoauea ha x —^ did act favour the UriU$h hut bacauaa of tha euplneBaaa of the lattar* ,*ie would have preferred the Brltleh but their reireeantattre, whoa he aaut foi lu the hope that they would olrwavoiit the »«Aerloau repreeeutatlve did not do ao* vae that hi» fault he aeked? he wac ulwaye ready to treat with aod to help the BrlUah t and arltlah ooueerm! t but they were diff icult and would itot help thmeelvce or him* If thla wae a hlut for a an* approach t ead the fact that It wae weld In the ^^wiicy a#wm to afcc* that It wee, one of the two followl m poeelbilitlee be in the ^Inde of two imlera* 4* lhat Iba .^aud »u^;gaated to the shaikh that the a,l#0.0* ul^ht bfe induced to offer hln a very large eum of money down which would while not ec avowed publicly be glveo. on the and ere tuna lag that ho wculu ceda hie share of the Heutral one to Kierelt and thereby ab&amp;n&amp;m all claims to future royalties* Thue both he cun the ».h^ikh of Kuwait voaid benefit and the Britleh Ocarerased* r^ould jr^ably be not diepleased* IXf the heutral * oue o-^uecd to be half ^able prerutsably any f iret rofucole and options cxisting between Cospaulae and tfaudi /j*abia fer hor share of oil «cploltaUon would just lapse)* In any oaee Holieca cane away from his: intorrlew with the ^balich with thle icA Ui hie hjac as a possibility that he aijit eu^joat to hie Coapaiiy &amp;r*. i iutoreetlng that it au~t have bo*n put by the .hai?A althou^i not in ao saaziy words* T, l ,9#fl &amp; W,S l £iaa le that/Is that suggested in the letter of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. It has some likelihood in that,my predecessor told me on my arrival here that the Shaikh believes that jjaerioan concerns are easier to deal with than the i&gt;..I.O.C. (and its affiliated Companies). On the other hand the Shaikh is well aware of the embarrassment it would cause and I doubt if he v/ould be so firm or so pleased with himself as he appears to be just now in this connection unless there were some happier and more profitable plan in his mind. 5 # The third possibility, ruling out an understanding with Ibn Saud, is that the shaikh is holding to his conception that when Ibn tiaud dies the border tribes will simply transfer their allegiance to their ancient leader the Shaikh of Kuwait and that with little or no action on his part the de facto frontier of Kuwait will return to roughly what it was formerly i.e. that of the Anglo-Turkish Convention including the Neutral Zone. 5 # in that case he has only to bide his time and the whole Zone will be his. 7# On the other hand the Shaikh while giving to me his reason for refusal as being the peculiar juridical nature of the Zone also added that in any case i he did wish to enter into negotiations he would certainly not give it away to the first comer, as Holmes seemed to think he should. 'I should let it be known to several British Companies*, he said. 'I should tell Lord Lloyd and others”, he added. will t* remembered that Lord Lloyd, as the ohalhh says, followed him to Parle to have e final word with him this last summer)* 8. Reviewing the whole affair I incline myself to think that the two Rulers have had a heart to heart their interests meet and will discussion, have seen where4 will keep in touch on the subject. Possibly they have no definite concerted plan upon which to act but that certain possibilities (1 and 2 above) were taken into review and may be pursued, perhaps both at the same time one being played against the other. 9. The shaikh of Kuwait would of course reserve to himself the third possibility, which would suit him best of all. He would therefore be in no great hurry. Ibn iiaud on the other hand undoubtedly is, in order to obtain ready money. 10. To sum up I should say therefore that the probabilities are that Ibn Saud and the Shaikh of Kuwait have come to a working agreement without a definite decision on any exact plan and that in any case the Shaikh of Kuwait would be inclined to play for time. He would be certainly against coming to an arrangement whereby an American Company already working in Rasa should work the whole of the Neutral Zone, with its appearance of abandoning the Zone, although it is just possible that he might be engineered into accepting the situation in exchange for continued good relations. 11. In the case of Possibility 1, the sum which Ibn Saud would ask as capitalized royalty on an unknown oil-field would presumably be staggeringly high but perhaps not beyond what the A.1.0.0. would pny.

Major Longrigg said that Major Holmes was undoubtedly on very close friendly terms with the Bhaikh, hut of course the latter was not completely under his thumb. Mr.Skliros also mentioned a story told him by /dlibi to the effect that ibn Baud had received J*;50,000 from the Califomia-Arabian Oil Company for the option given to them by him for his share in the Neutral Zone, and would be willing, for £1,000 from P.C.I..,to return that £60,000 to the American Company, get clear of his option and do business with P.C.li.

CITY-GATE HOUSE FINSBURY SQUARE LONDON, S.C.2 PC.26/109 15th September 1936. My dear Clausen, Your letter of September l4th. The limited nature of the decision given by His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Hawar group of Islands is clearly understood by the Company. When I said in my note that you had replied that Hawar -should be considered as 11 Bahrein territory, 1 should perhaps have said 'that it might temporarily and provisiona be considered as'. My note was aiming at a brevity which 1 fear it failed to achieve. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) Stephen H.Longrigg.

This summary will be very useful to us. There is only one point to which 1 feel it is desirable to refer at the moment. You mentioned that the question of the ownership of the Hawar group of islands has been referred to the India Office, who have replied that it should be considered as Bahrain territory. In order that there may be no misunderstanding may I refer to Walton’s letter to sklircs, dated the 14th July, No,P.Z.4582/36. It is important that the Company should clearly understand that His Majesty’s Government’s posit I-, n is as stated in the last sentence of that letter, namely, that on the basis of the evidence at present before them it appears to them that Hawar belongs to the Sheikh of Bahrein and the burden of disproving has claim would lie on any other potential claimant. Perhaps you will be kind enough to drop me a line to confirm that the Company appreciate the limited nature of the decision give'' by His Majesty’s Government in regard to this group of islands.

LONDON, E.C.2 11th September 1936. My dear Clauson, At our meeting in your office a few days ago, when Colonel Favle was present, you suggested that I should send you a summary of our proceedings, actual and intended, in the region which concerns the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. you are, I thinh, already fully informed on the subject but perhaps, as you suggested, your information is contained in scattered reports which it would be convenient to summarise. I will therefore do this . In the Neutral Zone, immediately South of the Kuwait Principality, we hoped, early in the present year, to obtain a Concession for the Sheikh oi Kuwait’s half-rights over the territory; for which purpose we drafted a concession and sent you a copy. Later, however, when our negotiator, Major Holmes, was actually in the field, we were led by the advice of the Foreign Office to renounce the idea of a Concession, in view of the delicate inter-state position of the Neutral Zone, and to ask merely for an Option on the Sheikh’s rights. This, in May, it seemed certain that we could obtain. At the last moment, however, the Shaikh refused to sign (tempering his r efusal with many friendly expressions) and said he would prefer to leave the question temporarily in abeyance. The reason, wo believe, was that, owing to his increasingly friendly relations with ibn Saud,the Sheikh he Zone in his c the de-limitc bestow, not i are convinced shall probab] in the hope 1 in the a Concession waters) not e Contact was n certain amenc were given a wo can probat made what wo the shaikh*s Draft and ofj The question us to you, ai as Bahrain te The Cc administrate in that Islai therefore shj the drilling details are £ as Company»s has paid a f] residence at there a fortin!&gt; *&gt; the Shaikh hoped for the re-incorporation ol the Neutral Zone in his own territories (as was the case previous to the de-limitation oi the Zone) and thus for the power to bestow, not half, but the whole. Both he and ibn Send are convinced that the Neutral Zone is rich in oil. We shall probably return to the charge later in this year, in the hope that the Shaikh will have modified his position. in the Bahrain group of islands, we intend to obtain a Concession for all the territory (including territorial waters) not already leased to the Bahrain Oil Company. Contact was made with the shaikh by Major Holmes and certain amendments to our Draft Concession - of which you were given a copy - ,.erc made by the Shaikh. Nith these we can probably agree. On the financial side we have made what wo consider a generous offer, but have not yet the shaikh*s reply. 1 am hoping to discuss the revised Draft and offer with Mr. Belgrave within the next few days. The question of ownership of Hawar island was reierred by us to you, and you have replied that it should be considered as Bahrain territory. The Company proposes to make Bahrain the administrative headquarters of its activities, not only in that Island, but in the whole Persian Gulf area. It is therefore shipping to Manama the necessary equipment for the drilling and geological parties proposed, of which details are given below. Mr. D.V.Packer, whose appointment as Company’s Manager in that area you have already approved, has paid a flying visit to the Gulf, and will take up his residence at Manama on October 19th. He will be joined there a fortnight later by geologists and drillers, who so work/work (as wil Mr. Packer 7 / accommodatio.

Mr. Packer will arrange for his house and office accommodation on his arrival, meanwhile occupying Major Holmes' house. Wo are at the moment taking in hand, through the Bombay Agency of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the recruitment of certain Indian personnel, which we think will be necessary for our office, our Qatar drilling programme, and our Trucial Coast geological programme. Wc have sent you under separate letter particulars of the Indian personnel we propose to import, and are anxious to observe the proper formalities in this connection. In the event of our importing a limited number of rig-coolies from Iraq for work on Qatar, we shall obtain the necessary permits in the same way, but shall, of course, do our own recruiting in Iraq. The Company's interim Agent, pending Mr. Packer's establishment, is Haji Yus if ICanu. The Qatar Concession remains, at the moment of writing, the property of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who obtained it early in 1935, and followed this by signing a Political Agreement with H.M.G. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. has now formed a subsidiary, Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., with the object of taking over the Concession from the A.I.O.C. This proposal has, within the last day or two, received India Office consent, and letters to the Shaikh of Qatar, proposing that he agree to the trojisfer, arc b^ing sent by the A.I.O.C. Abadan and, we understand, by uhe Political Resident. The text of Abadan's letter will first have been approved by the Resident.

One of these was the drilling of two water-wells on Qatar, and this we propose to carry out during the coming Autumn and Winter. Qatar will bo visited by two of our geologists, Messrs. T.F.Williamson and D. Glynn Jones, early in November, for the purpose of siting the wells in consultation with the Shaikh. These will be accompanied, or immediately followed, by Mr.O.S. Dickson, who will be in local charge of the drilling, and by Mr. W.St.G.Hombcrsley, who will supervise the drilling initially and by subsequent visits. The Company will take over the house already hired by the A.I.O.C. at Doha, and will ship from Bahrain the necessary motor vehicles and drilling and other materials. On the Trucial Coast two-year Options were, as you know, obtained by the A.I.O.C. during 1935 irom the Rulers of five out of the six independent Sheikhdoms, TJmm-al-Qaiwain being the exception. You have, of course, copies of those Options which envisage the granting of a long-term Concession to the same or an associated company during the period. Copies of Draft Concessions for the purpose were supplied to you early in the present year and your permission obtained for the arrangement of concessions by our negotiator, Major Holmes. The latter accordingly visited the Trucial Coast in Juno, found touch with most of the Shaikhs and took up his abode at Sharjah for three months. Ho found the Shaikhs largely preoccupied with the pearl-diving season, but was able to make considerable progress with the Shaikh of Dubai, whom he regaras as one of the most influential. A Concession was arranged with Shaikh Maktum, the text of which has been communicatcd/communicated to of the 27 Artie Holmes, but the We understand x asked to enter subject, was ur more of the C-O'v hope that all i of signature ii probably returr to arrange witi which, we undei of the Trucial believe, upon Company and requirement fo] of the Gulf, ij discovered. &lt; addressed you ; It is t giving Shaikhs security claus thus securing ' Shaikhs of Sha signed. We h consequences o that the polit matter to them permit ratific imagine, longcommunicated to you for your agreement. In the end each of the 27 Articles were initialled by the Shaikh and Major Holmes, but the Concession as a whole has not been signed. We understand that the Shaikh, having heard that he would be asked to enter into a further Agreement with on the subject, was unwilling to sign the Concession until he knew more of the Government obligations it would involve. We hope that ail this may be satisfactorily arranged to permit of signature in the present Autumn, when Major Holmes will probably return to the Gulf. Meanwhile the Company hopes to arrange with you the terms of the apolitical Agreement 1 ’ which, we understand, will be necessary in the case of each of the Trucial Coast Concessions. The only point, we believe, upon which difference of opinion between the Company and H*M.G. may occur is in the matter 01 the latter': requirement for a refinery to be erected on the Arab side of the Gulf, in connection with oil which may some day be ■discovered. On this matter the Company has recently addressed you in a separate letter. It is to be noted that only two of the five option giving Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast have yet signed the security clause propounded to them by the political Resident thus securing H.M.G.’s ratification of the Options. The Shaikhs of Sharjah, Ajman and Ras - a 1 -TCha imah have not yet signed. We have invited your attention to possible consequences of this failure to sign, and expressed Rie hope that the political Resident will be able to represent the matter to them in such a light that .they will sign thu^ permit ratification of the Options. , Without cliis, imagine, long term Concessions could scarcely follow, ^ndour field v/or is our intent to Dubai abou sited the Q,at have leased a camps, they w Shaikhdoms, a Ras-al-Khaima!

Major Holmes left the Trucial Coast on September 2nd and Kuwait two or three nays later. He will be in England tomorrow, September 12th, for a short visit of consultation and holiday. We have intended to approach the Sultan of Muscat and Oman for a Concession similar to those proposed for the Trucial Coast, but owing to his long absence at Dhofar, we have not yet been in touch with him.

He said that the casgmny had mode no proposal In this sense# but it is curious that the subject was raised vhile ^•Hamilton# the London lepresentative of the Standard Oil Co. of California# and other ^mior officials of the company were in Jedda. 6. It is clear that the uaudi Government went money very badly# and that they hope that in some way Hi© Majesty 1 ® Covernment can help them to exploit their gihai^e of the oil in the Kuwait neutral /.one. they kno*; ^hat an awkward position they are in by reason of the option granted to the standard Oil company.

That I bn Baud might ** attest to intx^oduce oil and iieutral zone into blockade negotiations as a bargain counter’ 1 was foreseen by the shaikh two years ago* according, to the above- mentioned telegram sent by the Political Agent at Kuwait on April 10th 1936* It 1 b obvious that a bargain of this kind would not appeal to the Shaikh, who evidently believes that hie position in regard to the Neutral lone and to baud! Arabia will change fundamentally on I bn Band’s death. Hor is there any roaeon why it should be attractive to Hi© Msjeaty’s Governments who have always maintained that the blockade is unwarranted and that Ibn Baud ought to enter JUito a trade a^eement with Kuweit with no other inducement than the advantage© to be gained from good relatione end legitimate trade* 7. as I have said before I think it i© to our advantage that I bn Baud should find some frech source of revenue; and if there ivere anything we could do to asstet him to that end that was consonant with our &lt;Nffi interest© and with those of any territories with t&amp;leh we are in special relations- n y* should I think not nogloct to do It.

This answer would naturally carry with It an obligation on the part of Kle kajeaty 1 a Government to refrain from using their Influence with the shaikh of Kowelt to dissuade him from acceding to the Standard Oil Company’s application. But *r. Eden realises that unless the Sheikh has altered his views since he told the (Political Agent in 1956 (see Koweit telegram ? o. 99 of 10th April* 1955) that he had no intention of granting a concession for his half interest in the Neutral Zono to anyone so long as fcing Xbn fcaud lived, no dissuasion is likely to be necessary. The problem may, on the contrary, be to persuade him to cooperate in the exploitation of the oil, if any, in the sone. But, however this way be, the first step that is required is to ahow good-will to the Saudi Arabian Gov*r.oment by indicating that thair nominees are free to approach the Cheikh of koweit. 6.

The Marquess of Zetland sees no reason to dissent from Mr. Secretary Eden r s proposal, as set out in paragraph 3 of that letter, v/hich appears to 'be substantially identical with the proposal made by His t Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, namely, to repeat the tatement made by Mr. Rondel on September 25 th, 1934&lt; Lord Zetland, indeed, is in full agreement with Mr# nden that it is most desirable not to give King Ibn Gaud any reason to think that His Majesty’s Government are anxious to obstruct his interests in this matter His Lordship does not, however, feel that His Majesty’s Government would be justified in taking the further steps which it would appear that Mr. Eden is inclined to suggest. For instance, it would, in his opinion, be imprudent to put any pressure on the Sheikh of Kuwait to be a party to a concession granted to an American Company. Such a proceeding would, in his ^iev, be contrary to the trend of British policy in the e-ulf and would cause considerable confusion in the mind of hie Sheikh, and possibly of the other Persian Gulf rulers, for instance the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast, who arc at present being pressed to grant oil concession^ to Petroleum Concessions Limited rather than to the v/^xlard Oil/ ecretary of State,Oil Oornpai opinion, \ to advise with regai that such interests, is, in fac Final that the p involved i under admi: to outweig] His Majest; revenues a* in the Neui His Lc consideratj he informec objection t by the Stan to them tha positive in he is incli (see Petrol dated the 1; acquaint th&lt; already anc Sheikh is cc subject to/* in the Persj to inform ti has been mac2 \ Oil Company of California.

There is every reason to suppose that this is, in fact, the Sheikh's view. j inallo, ids Lordship is by no means convinced that the possibilities of friction that would he involved in any arrangement to bring the Neutral zone under administration and protection might not he found -O outweigh the advantages accruing indirectly to his Majesty’s Government from such addition to Saudi revenues as might result from the exploitation of oil in the Neutral Zone. His Lordship would accordingly suggest, for Mr. Eden’s consideration, that while the Saudi Government should he informed that His Majesty’s Government have no objection to any firm proposition being put to- the Sheikh -y the Standard Oil Company no indication should he given to them that His Majesty's Government would exert their pcsicive influence in favour of this Company. Indeed, J iie inclined to agree with the Secretary for ines / (see Petroleun^jl^^artment letter to the Foreign Office dated the 12th June) that it might he desirable to acquaint the Saudi Government with the fact that there is already another competitor in the field so far as the oheikh is concerned.

It is the policy of His Majesty’s Government at the present time to do what is possible to assist the improvement of the financial situation in Saudi Arabia and to maintain good relations with Ibn Saud , in view of the general situation in the Middle East. Fran this point of view any plan for oil exploitation in the Koweit neutral zone area would probably be welcome to H.M.G. 3.

Mr. Longrigg, of Petroleum Concessions Limited having called on me to discuss another Question this morning, I took the opportunity to ask him whether he was familiar with the question of the Koweit Neutral Zone. On his replying in the affirmative, I asked him v/hether nothing could be done to reach an agreement with a view to facilitating the development of the oil resources of this area. 2, I gave him a brief explanation why we were anxious to see these oil resources developed. 3. Mr.Longrigg explained that the option which had been granted by Ibn Saud to the Standard Oil Company of California did not constitute an insuperable bar to exploitation. According to his information, the option only held good so long as King Ibn Saud did not repay to the Standard Oil Company of California the £50,000 advance which they had made to him. It would then be open to Petroleum Concessions Limited to pay this sum to King Ibn Saud in order to enable him to repay this debt and they would then be free to obtain a direct concession from him in respect of his rights over the zone. Ibn Saud had, however, asked for £100,000 and, as the concession would still have to be negotiated the Company thought that this price for the Standard Oil of California’s present option was much too high. 4. I then asked whether the obvious alternative was not for the two Companies to try to combine to exploit the zone jointly. Mr. Longfigg entirely agreed, and said that this would as a matter of fact suit everyone. Negotiations had/had in fe nearly si quite cor quoted ii difficult participa doubt awa Concessio New Jerse Companies a view to advanced breach oc on very b; As a resu! any attemj come to ai Californie and negoti 5.

Unfortunately - and he now wished to speak quite confidentially and asked that his name might not be quoted if the matter were referred to again - an unexpected diificulty iind arisen at the last moment from the American participants in Petroleum Concessions Limited. As X was no doubt aware, the American 23.75^.. holding in Petroleum Concessions Lim-ited was held by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and the Standard Oil Company of New York. These Companies had been in negotiation in the United States with a view to a possiole comoination. Negotiations were v/ell advanced when largely for personal reasons, a complete breach occurred, and the Standard Oil of New Jersey v/ere now on very bad terms indeed with the Standard Oil of California. As a result, ^ixe Standard Oil of Now Jersey were objecting to any attempt on the part of petroleum Concessions Limited to come to an agreement with the Standard Oil Company of California for the exploitation of the Kov/eit Neutral Zone, and negotiations had been suspended. 5. I asked Mr. Longrigg whether he thought that Lord Cadman could do anything to help. Mr. Longrigg said that, if we v/ere anxious to secure the early exploitation of the Loweit neutral zone, he thought it might be well worth v/hile taking the matter up with lord Cadman personally. At the same time, he was doubtful whether Lord Cadman would be able to overcome the personal difficulties which had developed between the Standard Oil of New Jersey and the Standard Oil of California. 6. I gathered that Mr. Longrigg was fairly hopeful about the prospects of oil in the Koweit neutral zone, though he emphasised that the area was small - much smaller, for example,/a necessari smaller the be one of 1 7. 1 Concessions neutral zon agreement w pay £50 or existing op unlikely th(\ c Uj , example, than Qatar. I said that size did not seem to be a necessarily decisive factor, since Bahrein, which was far smaller than the Kov/eit neutral zone, had now turned out to be one of the best oil fields in the Middle East. 7. I derived the general impression that Petroleum Concessions Limited would be very glad to exploit the Lowe it neutral zone, and would rather do this by means of an agreement with the Standard Oil of California than have to pay £50 or £100,000 in order to acquire the latter Company’s existing option. Mr. Longrigg emphasised that it was unlikely that there would be any difficulties from the Sheikh of Koweit, or from Ibn Saud, who both of them appeared ready to agree to reasonable conditions about royalties etc. (Sgd. ) G.

I briefly explained the position, and emphasised our anxiety to ensure that any oil resources in the Kov/eit neutral zone might be developed as early as possible. I explained that, for political reasons, v/e were anxious to uo what we could to help Ton Saud to remain prosperous and independent, but that at present his great difficulty was finance, since Saudi Arabia possessed practically no sources of revenue other than the pilgrimage, the revenue from which was of course totally inadequate. In these circumstances, if the I.P.C. could see their way to taking some forward step over this question, either by buying out the Standard Oil of California’s option, or by combining with that Company for the exploitation of the zone, it would be all to the good. Prom the purely British point of view, of course, we should very much like to see the I.P. C. working any oil there might be. Lord Cadman began by saying that there could be no question of buying the Standard Oil of California’s option. This would be simply paying blackmail, particularly as the concession would still have to be negotiated. As regards combining with the Standard Oil of California, it was difficult to say quite how far the personal considerations about which Mr. Longrigg had spoken were entirely genuine. Negotiations were still pending, since the Standard Oil of California were having great difficulties in marketing their Bahrein oil, and Lord Cadman’s organisations might be prepared to do a deal on the basis of giving the Standard of California certain marketing facilities. This might perhaps offer an opportunity of coming to some arrangement about the Koweit neutral zone. Lord Cadman would look into the matter personally to see whether • • •whether anything could he done - hut of course oil still - had to he found in the zone, and the Koweit Oil Conpany’s recent experiences in Koweit, where they had had to close down theii operations on tne north side of Koweit gay, were rather discouraging. The Company were now starting work in the southern area ol howeit, and this might provide a better indication of whether any oil was likely to he found in the neutral zone. (oigned) G. .

Skliros of Petroleum Concessions Limited came to see me this morning. lie said that he had been informed of my previous conversations with Mr. Longrigg and Lord Cadman on this subject, and that he understood that we were anxious that Petroleum Concessions Limited should take any action it could to secure the early exploitation of any oil in the zone in order that Ibn Saud, whom v/e v/ere anxious to assist for political reasons, as being the ruler mo' t worth helping and maintaining in Saudi Arabia, might obtain some advantage from the royalties. He understood therefore that we wished the Company to come to an arrangement with Ibn Saud to take over the California Company’s option. Although the position was rather obscure, he understood that this could be done by repaying to the California Company the loan of £50,000 which was the consideration for which they had obtained their option. Ibn Saud would derive no benefit ffcom this, since he would only be exchanging one creditor for another, but he would then be quit of his commitment to the California Company and free to give a concession in so far as he was concerned to petroleum Concessions Limited.2-0(7 2. I told Mr* Skliros that I had understood from Say previous conversations that his Company were not at all inclined to pay tnis suirif and would prefer to come to some agreement with the California Company for the joint exploitation of the zone. Mr. ikliros denied this. He said that his Company would certainly not wish to combine with the California Company* who a.lrendy had far too greet an interest in the development of Arabian oil. Their interests would almost certainly have to be bought out in time, and it would pay Petroleum Concessions far better to dispose of any rights or claims which California Company might have by a capital payment at the outset than to do anything which would extend the California Company’s sphere in Arabia and increase the expense of eventually buying them out. Oil generally (i.e. outside Arabia) had lately been doing very well and the sum involved was not a large one. It was therefore quite possible for Petroleum Concessions Limited to repay the £50,000 to acquire the option and negotiate a new concession with Ibn Saud, who had indeed indicated that he would prefer to deal v/ith a British Coi r-xny and did not want to get too tied up with the California Company. But there was no evidence to show that there really was any oil in the neutral zone. Had the California Company’s operations in Hasa proved successful, this would have indicated more likelihood of oil in the neutral zone and matters might have been different. As it was, the California Company had only found a few pockets of oil in Hasa. It was of excellent quality, but there were not yet any indications of a large or important structure.

They had drilled a well of 8,000 feet on the north side of the hey, but had only found small indications of oil in quite unremunenative quantities. They were now drilling south of K 0 weit, and, if they found oil there, it might be an important indication of oil in the zone. But there was nothing to go on as yet. Mr. Skliros then gave me an interesting account of the oil position in the rest of Arabia, which I am noting separately. 3. Mr. Skliros then asked whether, if his Company went forward with this proposal, and spent £50,000 on taking over the Standard Oil Company's option, there was anything which His Majesty’s Government could do to help them. 4. I said that I wished to make it clear at the outset that, although we should welcome anything they could do to help Ibn Baud, and should like to see them operating in the Kov/eit neutral zone, we could not take the responsibility of influencing them against their own commercial judgment. It might well be that the whole transaction would prove entirely unremunerative, and if they had then acted on our suggestion, they would no doubt regard us as partly responsible for any losses they incurred. we clearly could not take such a responsibility. Mr. Skliros said he quite understood this, and that any decision which his Company took would be taken entirely on their own responsibility, and on commercial grounds.

As regards the Sheikh of Koweit, His Majesty’s Government v/ere in a position to exercise more effective influence. Apart from the fact that, if Petroleum Concessions Limited held an option or a concession from Ibn Saud in respect of his rights, the Sheikh could not give an effective concession to anyone else, he was in fact very dependent on His Majesty’s Government and we could probably give him a very strong lead. Moreover, we could veto his grant of a concession to anyone else, provided this did not lead to threats of reprisals from foreign interests, as had happened in the early days of the- first American application for Koweit itself (Mr. Skliros said that he thought that this situation was now most unlikely to recur). I explained, however, that the Sheikh of Koweit was not always easy to deal with, and was/was a 11 'fc *fc 1s rulers, Gove deal against a question b might not be Petroleum Co On the other wanted to ob ought to be to grant it, 6.

Ibn Saud bad help in tryi: neutral zone to negotiate might possibwas a little inclined to try to play off the various v rulers, Governments and interests with whom he had to deal against each other, (I mentioned this in reply to a question by Kr. Skliros whether the Sheikh of Koweit might not be anxious to grant the concessions to Petroleum Concessions Limited in order to please Ibn Saud). On the other hand, if Petroleum Concessions Limited really wanted to obtain a concession from him, I thought that it ought to be possible to do a good deal towards inducing him to grant it. 6. Finally, Mr. skliros asked whether the matter was urgent. I said that it was urgent in the sense that Ibn Saud badly needed money, and had in fact asked for our help in trying to secure the exploitation of the Loweit neutral zone. Mr. Skliros said that it would be difficult to negotiate in Jedda until October, but that something might possibly be done through the Saudi Minister here. I said that I thought this would be worth trying, particularly as Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was still here and would be available between his return from Scotland on about the 10th July and his departure for Arabia on about the 15th July, 7. Mr. Skliros said that he would put the matter before his Board at their meeting to-morrow, and let me hear within a day or two what they had decided. If they decided to go forward with the matter, he would propose to get into immediate touch with Sheikh Hafiz V/ahba v/ith a view to pursuing the matter with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin early next week.

I reminded him of Sheikl conversations with Sir Reader Bullard, Jedda despatch No. 59^of the 10th April (E 2440), and told him that we had ever since been giving the matter our earnest attention. We had now found that there were likely to be great difficulties in the way of arranging for the Standard Oil Company of California to secure an effective concession from both rulers over the Koweit neutral Zone; but, as a result of our consideration of the irotter, a new proposal has now emerged which might provide a way out of the difficulty. I understood that the Standard Oil Company of California had received its option in consideration of a loan which it had made to King Ibn Saud, and that, if this loan could be repaid, the King might be able to get clear of his obligation towards the Company. Sheikh Hafiz confirmed that this was so. I said that I now understood from Petroleum Concessions i Yusuf Yasin as recorded in in 'j, l L Limited/Limited, who, from ling Ibr that they hac Ibn Saud to c I told £ (which was tb a British cor contain certa Government wo any concessio the standing held a conces ling Ibn Saud company of th I then s King would li Concessions L it would be w in the near f to come to sa Yusuf Yasin w, discussion, SJ if I would ar: appointment w: Sheikh Yusuf 1 ICth July. I am pursLimited, who, as Sheikh Hafiz knew already held a concession from l ing Ihn Saud for the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, that they had a proposal to make which would enable King Ibn Saud to discharge this debt. I told Sheikh Hafiz that Petroleum Concessions Limited (which was the Iraq Petroleum Company in another form) was a British conpany of the highest standing, although it did contain certain foreign elements, and that His Majesty’s Government would certainly view with favour the grant of any concession to it. Sheikh Hafiz entirely agreed as to the standing of Petroleum Concessions Limited, which already held a concession from King Ibn Saud, and confirmed that 1 ing Ibn Saud would prefer to give a concession to a British company of this character than to an American concern. I then said that, if Sheikh Hafiz thought that the King would like to consider the proposals which Petroleum Concessions Limited wanted to put forward, I thought that it would be well for him to see Mr. Skliros of that company in the near future, since it might perhaps then be possible to come to some preliminary understanding while Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was still in this country. After some further discussion. Sheikh Hafiz V/ahba said he would be very glad if I would arrange for Mr. Skliros to make an early appointment with him for a preliminary discussion prior to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s return from Scotland at, or about, ICth July. I am pursuing the matter on these lines with Mr. Skliros.

He had himself at first been in favour of p.C.Ltd. buying out the California Company’s option on the neutral zone, but the Board had shown great reluctance to embark on any action which would imply a direct conflict of interests with the California Company. In their view, it would be far better for Petroleum Concessions to acquire the option as part of a general deal , rather than appear to be making an attack on a sister Company. what they now proposed therefore was to make an offer to Ibn Baud for rights over his entire territory, excepting those parts of it which had already been granted to other concessionnaires or were already covered by previous concessions, but including the neutral zone. This would mean that they would obtain exclusive rights over the whole of Saudi Arabia with the exception of the Eastern stretch already granted to the Standard Oil Company of California (i.e. all the territory east of the Dahana - the S-shaped belt of sandy steppe country dividing Nejd from Hasa). petroleum Concessions Limited already hold a concession over the whole of the west coast. For this they would pay to Ibn Saud a sum of £100,000 gold in cash, out of which he would have to settle with the standard Oil of California in order to get them to release him from their option over the Koweit neutral zone. Mr. Skliros said that Ibn Saud was certainly free to do this, if he repaid the California Company the debt he owed them, and that he did not think this debt amounted in fact to as much as £50,000 Petroleum ..•Petroled £15,000 gold v/ould 'be pre] years in adv£ If oil \ the terras coi concession fc basis of 4s. concession \;} a pipe line, line to the c might be four Central Arabj The poir zone was that and Ibn Saud California dj was convinced Limited would California Cc Mr. Skli Hafiz I-ahba, him to secure Petroleum Con c omp r e hen s i ve payable to lb should not go if the Saudi Mr. Skliros w negotiate a c ar r angemen t s au tumn.

Ski in7 '2o7] Petroleuin Concessions wou^d further pay to Ibn Saud £15,000 gold per annum for five years for these rights, and would be prepared, if he pressed them, to pay the first two years in advance. If oil were found it would be exploited on the basis of the terms contained in Petroleum Concessions Limited’s existing concession for the Red Sea coast of Saudi ,.rabia, i.e. on a basis of 4s. gold per ton etc. The only provision of that concession which would not be applicable would be that regarding a pipe line, since, while it would be easy to build a pipe line to the coast from any point in the western area where oil might be found, it would be far more difficult to do so from Central Arabia. The point of these proposals as regards the Kov/eit neutral zone was that the zone would be included in the general deal, and Ton Saud would have to settle with the Standard Oil of California direct in respect of their option (which Mr. Skliros was convinced lie could do) , and that petroleum Concessions Limited would not be brought into direct conflict with the California Company over a small secondary area. Mr. Skliros suggested that I should now explain to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, with reference to Ibn Saud’s appeal to us to help him to secure the exploitation of the neutral zone, that Petroleum Concessions Limited were prepared to make him a comprehensive offer under which considerable sums would become nrPT’aT'l'l O + T'K vi Or-wiz-T o 4- r'.v&gt; siri •? v. l-i U Pin rerrac + -t-V&gt;r&gt;+ T negotiate a concession here, leaving any further discussions or arrangements to be dealt with by Mr. Longrigg at jedda in the au tumn.

Letter No.P.Z.6160/1934, dated London, 2hd October, 19347 (from Political Agent, Kuwait on leave to Mr.Laithwaite). The Sl^iKh* s attitude, suimaed up, is that the neutralizing of this zone was a hurried expedient - a compromise - made against the wishes of the then young Rular of Kuwait on his behalf by His Britannic Majesty*s Government, and that he hopes one day to recover his full rights in it. In order to appreciate the shaikh's attitude Lorrimer * s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, /ol.E, page 1061 should be studied tOi'ether with any map, showing the former Boundaries of Kuwait under the Anglo-Turkish Convent ion, such as the War Office G.S.G.S.map No.3869 a (1933) of '(a) Air Routes, (b) Islands In the Persian Gulf and (c) Boundaries of Kuwait and2»A Joint Concession (*u 2 - Reference para 3(b) of the India Office Jixpress Lett er• The Shaikh woulh ask how, in the event of a joint ooncession can the half rights of sovereignty of both Rulers be sustained? How would security, recruiting of labour, appropriation of lands, and » judicial rights over the Arab and other employees be exercised? I think that it may be at once decided that it is impossible to give him any satisfactory answer - and that it is impossible to devise any agreement acceptable to all the parties concerned on the lines of the agreements we already know, such as the Kuwait Oil Company agreement with the Shaikh of Kuwait. The Shaikh of Kuwait has already pointed this out and would if we pressed him to give way and grant a joint concession, do so again. 3. (a) Another Course. The only course seems to be that either Saudi Arabia or Kuwait should be asked to cede its half rights in the zone, receiving however half all the emoluments and royalties which may at first or any time, up to a limit of so many years, accrue from the operations of the Oil Company in the area formerly the Jeutral Zone • The Shaikh of Kuwait will certainly never give up his half rights in the zone of his free will. Ibn :&gt;aud is in quest - and urgently - of money* There would therefore appear to be moi chance of a successful outcome if Ibn baud were asKed to cede his half rights to Kuwait and the Shaikh were asked to sanction in exchange payment to Ibn ^aud of half alj. tup to the limit of ao many years. The grazing rights of Saudi tribes could be specifically protected and agreement reached that those at present taxed by Ibn Baud could still be taxed by him. Something like the machinery mentioned in Articles 9 and 10 of the Saudi Iraq Bon yolsinage agreement might ueefully be employed in case of dispute in this connection, art mght be embodied in the contemplated Saudi-Kuwait Bon Voleinage Agreement. (b) Advantages to the ohelich r It could be pointed out to the shaikh that he would ha/e Sained his great point,sovereignty over the Neutral Zone, which would in future be within the bounds of Kuwait. The Treaty of UJair (1922) refers to frcutlers and the limits of the Neutral Zone, and vould in this respect of course have to be superseded. All concessions, other than for oil,within the zone would of course be the Shaikhs to give, and further that in the end he has much to gain by a rich and strong Saudi Arabia, which is within the present policy of His Majesty’s Government and therefore should be his too. ■In a uition he ana his people would of course gain immensely by the labour employed and contracts given by, and sale of produce to, the Company. jcjlbn Saud To Ibn 3aud it could be pointed out that he gains his main object, cash. In any case, whichever company exploited the Neutral Zone would be compelled to demand the right to operate through Kuwait and use predominantly Kuwait labour and other resources. They could not be expected to work through say Has Tanoura 150 miles to the ^outh when Kuwait is only 50 miles away. Joint sovereignty during exploitation seems unworkable an* even if the Shaikh of Kuwait were forced by His Majesty’s- 5 Thio ordsr A r ou 1 cl Idj ord.6i* to sn su.

The fact remains that he has this grievance* This being so, and in view of his refusal in ^lay 1936 to discuss the question of heutral ^one Oil with Petroleum Concessions Limited (vide Residency Printed letter So. 460-S jpf the 1st June 19 r &gt;6), we have no reason to expect that hia reaction to any proposal for re-opening this question will bs enthueiaetie* 3 * ylth regard to fb^,.

In the question of his Oats Gardens in Iraq and in that of ths H»udi Blockade tne Shaikh has already two grievances against His Majesty 4 s Government* I am aware of course oi t e efiorta which His Majesty’ a Government have Laade, and are asking, in connection with both these questions, but from the Shaikh’s pel at of view the fact rsmains that th^ are unsettled, he has a third grievance in the matter of the ^jair Treaty, and any press ire from His Majesty's Government In the mat er of Neutral ^one Oil would give him a fourth and - in my opinion - a legitimate one* Further* more U is by no manna at all certain that His Majesty's Govern- meat would gain their object by *preasure% since the Ghaikn - if he fslt strongly on the subject • would remain firm, and His Majesty’s Government would then be in the unfortunate position of having aroused the Shaikh’s resentment without gaining their object. In fact a situation mi^ht ooae about not unlike thet envisaged in paragraph 3 of ay ’“Xpress Letter uo.tt/9 of the 24th May 1933 on the subject of pressure in connection with Kuwait Iraq Smuggling. 4. The above are my replies to the two specific points on . which my views have been asked. I should liKe, however, to aaks4- tn« follovring farther coanenta* the acheme propoaect by Petrotwtfm Cooce^Btona Limited seem 3 to rae an excellent one. 'y it !bn Seud will be free of hie coauiitaenta to the standard Oil Coops ny of California, whose place will be taicen by a partly British Company - Petrole am Conceneiona Limited, and the fim.ncea of Caudi Arab a will benefit, the Shaikh of 'Oi/fait will of coarse also benefit elnce he ^ill share equtilly with Ibn Baud the proceeds of any Neutral Zone concession granted to Petroleiw Concessions Limited. The mft in reason why he may hesitate to participate in the proposed arrangement la that - ae already explained - he has hopes some day of regaining the whole of the Neutral Zone for himself. fhile strongly deprecating anything in the way of press ire on the Shaikh to ‘come in* on the present arrangement there are various cogent arguments which we can use with hin in its favour. Tn the first place it could be pointed out to the Shaikh tbr*t the Kuwait Oil Company so far have found no oil in Kuwait territory in spite of deep boring, and though of course they will not give up without further trials, which will take some years, it is possible that they may not strike oil at all. If unfortunately this should occur the prospect of oil being found in the Neutral Zone would diminish, as would tne ternrthe company were prepared to offer for the latter, as for his recovering the whole of the Zone on Ibn flaud*s death the latter’s demise might be many years still in the future. Imam Yahya of Yemen, though scree eleven years older than Ibn Baud, is still going strong, an i even when Ion Zaud dies it is by no means certain that things would take a turn which would restore tne Zone to Kuwait. In other words a toira in hand ie worth two in the bueh, and unless the Cna ikh ie very oet in his attitude arguments on these lines should I think prove •ff set ivo. There is another aspect of this question: as a first rate bargaining /bargain* 1 ** countar againat the .audl ^loco-de. Here is :o '.e..Ttag, i. e . exploitation of oil in tne Heutral Zone, which (preeJaably) Jhn 3BUd ^anta hut which the Shaikh, though he aay eventually in not particularly keen about. The poeeibiiity tnerelore of linking the Shaikh’e aaeent to the oil agreement to Ifcn Want's assent to calling off tne blockade might be considered. g. with regard to tne next step to be taken X venture to suggest that the Foreign Office - as I understand tney are doing - might continue to explore Petroleum Concessions limited's proposal with the Saudi authorities, and to ascertain if tne latter are prepared to accept it - at all evente In principle. If for any reason the Saudi Government are not prepared to cousiaor t e propoaal then obviously there ie no object in our approaching tne Shaikh.

The idea is apparently that out of this lump sum Ibn baud would be able to take sufficient money to pay off the standard Oil Co. in respect of the option which they had over baudi rights in the neutral zone. I understand that the Company further propose to seek a concession from Ibn baud on terms which would involve payment of £15,000 per annum for the first five years. Mr. Rendel was seeing the baudi Minister yesterday evening and was going to inform him that he understood Petroleum Concessions Ltd* were prepared to make this offer, and that the Company is one of which H.M.G. approve and which they can commend to the baudi Goverhment. Mr. Kenctel asked whether the India Office would have any objection to this. I said that we should certainly welcome any proposal that might have the effect of putting some money into Ibn baud 1 s pocket and that we should quite agree that his proposal to tell the baudi Government that P.C.L. is a company of which H.M.G. approve. I suggested, however, that it was important not to say anything which would give the baudi Government the impress ion that the bhaikh of Kuwait would necessarily agree to the oil exploitation of the neutral zone by any oil company. I pointed out that hitherto both the Foreign Office and ourselves had been averse from encouraging exploitation of the ^one, that possibly this policy might have to be reconsidered if there was a prospect of helping the Saudi Government to ease their -/ financialfinancial position, but that this Department was at present unable to commit the Secretary of State to any proposal which would involve putting pressure on the Shaikh to induce him to agree to the exploitation of the zone.4963 2000 7.36 By A+p Mail.

It has been suggested to me as you are \ known to be a friend that I should ask you privately^ there is any indication of change in the views of the Shaikh of Kuwait as to giving an option or concession over the Neutral Zone and if there is any hope of opening negotiations, also should negotiations be opened what hope do you think there is of actual progress in them. Your opinion would no doubt be very valuable in saving long preliminary correspondence and useless discussions. I need hardly say that anything you say would be regarded as purely unofficial and your private opinion only. I hope you will consider yourself free to give me your own views. The Shaikh of Bahrain has just gone off on the 'haj ,f and is expected to be away for two months. Major Holmes is in America at present having safely survived his operation. It is highly probable that he will conduct any negotiations which might be opened at Kuwait for the Neutral Zone but this is for your private information only.

Dear Mr. Renael, You rrill remember our conversation on the ^Ena instant, regarding the extent of the Standard Oil Company of California’s option over the unallot- -ted parts of Saudi Arabia. You very kindly undertook to ask Sir Reader Bullard by cable for such information as he could obtain, iifcanwhile the information which reaches us this morning from our Jeddah Office seems to support the more pessimistic view which I gave you - that the option covers much more thanthe Kuwait Neutral Zone. The following is the text of our queries f o Jedda on the 21st.- H We understand that Standard Oil Company of California in 1933 as part of al Hasa Concession arrangements obtained option or prior right to concession over all central Saudi Arabia from which option Government can release itself only by repayment out of al Hasa royalties of loan advanced by S.O.C. ofC. Try with all discretion to verify fro-' it&amp;j ib or local S.O.u. of C. represent- -stive' • and the following is Jeddah’s reply this raornings- 'Your telegram of 21st from information received/2 . 'received from Standard Oil Company of California representative we understand in case of relinquish- -ment of al Hasa Concession option on central Saudi Arabia continues until all sums owing by Government have been paid but during the life of Concession option continues until S.C.C. of C elects not to exercise their right to Concession on terms equal to any other bona fide offer and until such offer has been accepted by Government and Concession has been granted.' If the Minister replies to you in a similar sense, we shall at least know where we stand. Yours sincerely, sd/- Stephen A.Longrigg,(E 1115/1036/91) VJ sri^ II II Ann Foreign Office, S.JT.l. !4y dear Sullard, I enclose for your information a letter which ftendel received some time ago from Longrigg of Petroleum Concessions Limited, asking whether the option which the Standard Oil Company of California has obtained in 1933 applied to the whole of central Saudi Arabia. 2. Rend el promised Longrigg at the time that we would ask you by telegram whether you could obtain confirmation of the information received by the company from Jedda, but an oversight, for which I must take full responsibility, this was never done. 3. I have, however, asked Zada whether he has the text of the option in London, since, as you will remember, it was proposed some months ago that the Saudi Arabian Legation should take legal advice as to the extent to which the option was binding upon them, and they could hardly take legal advice without providing their couneel with the actual text of the option. 4. I made it clear to Zada that I did not want to make any request which would embarass him per- -sonally. He told me in reply that he wouldw illingly let me have the text if it was in his possession, but added that to the best of his recollection the Legation had, as a matter of fact, when the question first arose, not been able to obtain advice for the very reason that they did not have the necessary texts. 5. I have heard no more from him, sol expect that he is still without the text, and is perhaps Reader Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., asking/ J edda.2 . asking Hi 3 Government to supply it* 6 # In the meanwhile Longrigg had heard from Hamiltois- of the California Arabian On Company that the option extends not only to the Kuwait Neutral 2one, tut to all unallotted areas in Nejd* 7. If it were possible for you to obtain confirmation of this information the Company would be very glad to have it. sd/- Lacy Baggalay.(S 1H5/1036/91) Mod iatr ibutian.

Mr. Longrigg opened the discussion by saying that there were three matters which he wished to raise, viz :~ A. The position in regard to the Kuwait Neutral Zone; B. The position in regard to the Bahrain Unallotted Area. C. The position on the Trucial Coast, etc. 2. With regard to A (the Kuwait Neutral Zone), Mr. Longrigg said that as a result of our refusal to allow Major Holmes to act as their negotiator at Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast, Major Holmes had severed his connection v;ith Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., and the Company were afraid he might now resume his connection with the California Company. Major Holmes was now at Kuwait to consult with the Shaikh regarding the Neutral Zone and owing to his influence with the Shaikh they were apprehensive lest he might persuade the Shaikh to give the concession to American interests before Petroleum Concessions Ltd. had been given a further opportunity of putting forward their proposals. Mr. Longrigg then went on to express the hope thatHis Majesty's Government might see their v\a^ to discourage American interests, or at least to ensure that the Shaikh did not cede his oil rights in the Neutral Zone until Petroleum Concessions Limited had been given a fiar opportunity of competing.

His Company might before long wish to secure a concession in the Neutral £one, over which they had optional rights in respect of Ibn Saud’s share. The plan he had been turning over in his mind was that the Calarabian Company should obtain a concession from Ibn gaud, and that a British Company should be formed by association between the Standard Oil Company of California and British interests (who would not , he said, be the Iraq Petroleum Company) for the purpose of obtaining concessional rights from the Sheikh of Koweit. Nothing definite h&amp;d been decided yet, but he hoped that when the time came for an approach to the Sheikh we would be helpful to his Company and not take the line that competition with a Company 'which was already in the field could not he permitted. I made no comment. (Mr. Ballantyne was referring, of course, to the situation on the Trucial Coast, about which he had previously asked me (a) whether there was yet any opening for the Standard Oil Company (b) whether there would be any opening for another British Company, e.g. a Company formed in association with American interests.

Scott told me voluntarily in an unofficis the other day that he understood that the Gulf Company had some little time ago been on the Transatlantic telephone to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company about going half shares on a new effort for the Neutral Zone i.e. as the Kuwait il Company. Scott says that Lord Cadman replied in vaguely polite terras and subsequently having, gone into the matter, the Anglo-1rani an Oil Company turned it down definitely. The next thing they knew was that Davis was unusually anxious to come here at once. 2 Neither Davis, 8cott or Dickson mentioned this approach of Davis' to the Sheilch. X got on to it through a hint from Holmes, and on my skirting the subject with the Shaikh, he then told me. 3 . The meeting at which the suggestion was made took place in Dickson's house, and he told Scott soon afterwards. ('1 was very pleased with him' said Scott).It was rather a peculiar story how they all three came to be there in Dickson's house and is 'fishy”. My impression is that the Kuwait Oil Company knew that Davis was going to have a shot at the Neutral r kone, washed their hands of it but wished him luck.

This is borne out by ^e Lyt that if the th additional articles are inserted in their proper places in the original agieement, the 'ghol^agreement jeads consecuLvH^c ^ ^ with the three articles inserted.

During the life of this agreement, the Government shall be under no obligation to repay the initial loan of £30,000 gold (or its equivalent), or the | second loan of £20,000 gold (or its equivalent). The Company shall have the right ! to recover the amount of these two loans by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. If the amount of the two loans, in whole or in part, shall not have been so recovered by the Company upon the termination of this contract, the Government shall repay the unrecovered amount in four equal and consecutive annual instalments, the first instalment to be paid within one year from the date of the termination of this agreement.

Article 9. Within ninety days after the commencement of drilling, the Company shall relinquish to the Government such portions of the exclusive area as the Company at that time may decide not to explore further, or to use otherwise in connexion with the enterprise. Similarly, from time to time, during the life of this contract, | the Company shall relinquish to the Government such further portions of the exclusive area as the Company may then decide not to explore or prospect further, or to use otherwise in connexion with the enterprise. The portions so relinquished shall thereupon be released from the terms and conditions of this contract, excepting only that during the life of this contract the Company shall continue to enjoy the right to use the portions so relinquished for transportation and communication facilities, which, however, shall interfere as little as practicable with any other use to which the relinquished portions may be put. Article 10. The Company shall commence operations connected with drilling as soon as a suitable structure has been found, and in any event if the ( ompany does not ' commence such operations within three years from the end of September 1933 I (subject to the provisions of article 27 hereof), the Government may terminate this contract. Once commenced, these operations shall be continued diligently until oil in commercial quantities has been discovered or until this agreement is terminated. If the Company should fail to declare so sooner, the date of ! discovery of oil in commercial quantities shall be the date upon which the Company has completed and tested a well or wells capable qt producing in accordance with first-class oil practice at least 2,000 tons of oil per day foi a period of thirty consecutive days. t . Operations connected with drilling include the ordering and shipping of materials and equipment to Saudi Arabia, the construction of roads, camps, buildings, structures, communication facilities, &amp;c., and the installation and operation of the machinery, equipment and facilities for drilling wells.

Upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall advance to the Government the sum of £50,000 gold, or its equivalent, and one year later the further sum of £50,000 gold, or its equivalent. The due date of the first advance shall be the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, a^\ provided in article 10 hereof, and the due date of the second advance shall be one year later. In each case the Company shall have sixty days following the due date within which to make the advance. Both of these advances are m account of royalties, which may be due to the Government, and, consequently, the Company shalf have the right to recover the amount of these advances by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. Article 12. Since it has been agreed that the annual rental of £5,000 gold, or its equivalent, is payable to the date of the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, and since it has been agreed also that the annual rental is to be payable in advance, it may happen that the last annual rental paid prior to the ^ate of discovery of oil in commercial quantities will covei a pei iod beyond the date of such discovery. In case that this period should be equal to oi gieatei than one- fifth of a year, the proportionate amount of the £5,000 gold, or its equivalent corresponding to such period, shall be treated as an advance on account of royalties due the Government, and consequently it should be recoverable by the Company by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. Article 13. As soon as practicable {i.e., allowing a reasonable time for ordering and shipping further materials and equipment to Saudi Arabia and commencing further work), after the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall continue operations connected with drilling by using at least two strings of tools. These operations shall continue diligently until the proven area has been drilled up in accordance with first-class oil-field practice, or until the contract is terminated. Article 14. The Company shall pay the Government a royalty on all net crude oil produced and saved and run from field storage, after first deducting^ (1) Water and foreign substance; and , . „ . (2) Oil required for the customary operations of the Company s installation within Saudi Arabia; and , (3) The oil required for the manufacturing the amounts of gasoline ana kerosene to be provided free each year to the Government in accordance with article 19 hereof.

It is agreed, furthermore, that the equivalent of pounds gold or shillings gold, for any payment which may be made hereunder in dollars, United States currency or in pounds sterling (with the exception of the first payment provided for in article 18 hereof), shall be based on the average of the rate of exchange as computed over a period of three months immediately preceding the due date of the payment. f Article 18.

Letter to his Excellency Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman-al-llamdan. Dear Sheikh Abdulla, Jedda, May 29, 1933. REFERRING to the contract which has been signed to-day by you, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government, and by the undersigned, on behalf of Standard 1 Oil Company of California, relative to an oil concession covering a portion ot Eastern Saudi Arabia, I am setting forth below the agreement we have also reached on behalf of the two parties to the same contract, which agreement shall10 Confidential be considered as a part of the said contract. For convenience, the two parties in question shall be referred to below in the same manner as designated in the said contract, namely, the “ Government ” and the “ Company,” and the said contract shall be referred to as the “ Saudi Arab Concession.” 1 . The Company is granted a preference right to an oil concession covering a certain area described in article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession. The preference right so granted the Company shall be a right to acquire an oil concession covering such area, exclusive of the so-called Neutral Zone also referred to in the same article 3, by equalling the terms of any offer for such concession that may be made the Government by others in good faith and that the Government may be willing and ready to accept. Within thirty days after receiving from the Government written notice, setting forth in full the terms of such offer, the Company shall notify the Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession by equalling the terms so offered. If the Company does not wish to do so, the Government is free to accept the offer made, but if an oil concession should not be granted to others on the same terms as those so offered and so presented to the Company, the preference right of the Company shall continue, at least so long f as the provisions of article 7 of the Saudi Arab Concession remain in force. 2 . The Company’s preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the so-called Neutral Zone referred to in article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession, shall be a right to equal, with respect to the rights of the Government in the Neutral Zone, the terms and conditions which may be obtained by the Sheikh of Koweit for a concession covering his rights in the Neutral Zone. In the absence of any grant of an oil concession covering such rights of the Sheikh of Koweit, the Government will endeavour to reach an agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit whereby the Company will be permitted to acquire an oil concession covering the rights of the Government and of the Sheikh of Koweit in the Neutral Zone. In either of these two events, the Company shall have a period of thirty days from the date it receives written notice setting forth in full the terms and conditions of the oil concession covering the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit in the Neutral Zone, or covering the terms of the proposed concession embracing the rights of the Government and of the Sheikh of Koweit in the Neutral Zone, as the case may be, within which to decide and to notify the Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession on such terms. If the Company does not wish to do so, the Government is free to negotiate with others, i but if the oil concession should not be granted to others on the same terms as those offered to the Company, the preference right of the Company shall continue, at j least so long as the provisions of article 7 of the Saudi Arab Concession remain in ! force. 3. The consent of the Government must be obtained before the Company shall have any right to examine the so-called Neutral Zone referred to in article 3 i of the Saudi Arab Concession. 4. The provisions of article 35 of the Saudi Arab Concession shall also apply to this agreement.

The Sheikh had made no nhat he said he had not told the sheikh was tlvit the 3mir Saud had made aavances to P.C.L. about a concession to cover not only the Neutral Zone, hut all the other remaining unalloted territory of Saudi Arabia. The ami r Saud had said that Saudi Arabia was now free of its commitment to the Standard Oil Company in regard to the Kuwait Neutral Zone. Holmes had no details as to how this had been achieved, but suggested Ghat any monetary commitment might have been dissipated by an agreement as to deductions, over a period, from future royalties on the paying wells in the existing concession area. ^ In any case the Saudis had gone as far as offering financial and definite terms to P.C.L.

In November Major l&amp;Tis, one of the American representatives of the Gulf Oil company element in the Kuwait Oil Company, visited Kuwait in that capacity, at any rate ostensibly. During his visit he took the opportunity to approach the Shaikh through Dickson on behalf of the oulf Oil Company in connection with obtaining a concession in the Neutral Zone. The Shaikh replied, as he had done to Holmes who approached him a year or so ago on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Limited, that there was nothing doing. The Shaikh quite correctly informed de laury of this approach. 2. The Kuwait Oil Company, whose employee Dickson of course is, made no objection to his being made use of as an intermediary and so I presume Davis*8 approach to the Shaikh had their blessing. Petroleum Concessions Limited have received instructions - vide India Office telegram No.1166 of 24th June - that they must keep us informed of any approach they make to the Shaikh, but I cannot find on ray files that either the Kuwait Oil Company or the Gulf Oil Company have received similar communications. I do not think that it is worth while at present for His Majesty’s Government to address such a communication to them, so ion,.-, as we can rely on the Shaikh letting us know as to any approach which may be made to / R.T.Peel Squire, M.C., The India Office, London.to him. Should, however, these Companies at any t ime in the future enter into negotiations with the J»hai^h for the Beutral Zone, we can inform them that we must be Kept informed of their progress. 3 . in the meantime I am as icing de Gaury to convey verbally to the Ghai*h my thanics for his having informed de Gaury of Davis*e approach, and of my appreciation of the Ghai^h*e under standing of the desirability of passing an to de Gaury news of any further approaches from whomsoever they may come concerning the Heutral Zone. # 4.

On the one hand if » s felt that to grant the Company’s request might cause political difficulties with lion Baud, since the California Arabian Standard Oil Company already had certain rights of option in respect of the Saudi share of the Neutral Zone, axd if Petroleum Concessions Limited obtained f u n concession from the Sheikh the exfect might well -l-o/ laggallay, Esq. ? ign Office,'to perpetuate t remote the prosp a single company exploitation of Baud's exchequer preventing'a fur from falling und' entirely non-Bri felt that this e: give a concessio; despatch express* request. Ryan N Jedcia telegremr 1 whole thought th situation furthe safeguard Petro consideration wa themselves decide 3. In esse: it was three year to secure an opti December (politic enclosure to Indi January ) reaffir&gt; to perpetuate the present des-dloclc and to render even more remote the prospects of any agreed concession being granted to a single company by both rulers f which would conduce to exploitation of oil in the neutral zone and so benefit Ibn Baud's exchequer. On the other hand the advantages of preventing’’a further potentially important area in Arabia from falling under the exclusive commerical control of an entirely non-British company'’ were appreciated, and as it was felt that this end might be achieved if the Sheikh were to give a concession to Petroleum Concessions Limited the despatch expressed a sympathetic attitude to the Comoany’s request. Ryan stated his views with some diffidence in Jedua telegram No.46 of the 14th April, 1936, but on the whole thought that a concession would only complicate the situation further and that an option would be adequate to safeguard Petroleum Concessions Limited's position. further consideration was rendered unnecessary when the Company themselves decided to apply only for an option. In essentials the position today is very much what it was three years ago. Petroleum Concessions Limited failed to secure an option from the Sheikh, who as recently as last December (political Agent's letted.395 of 8th December, enclosure to India Office letter P.2.8448/38 of the 3rd January ) reaffirmed his intention not to cede any oil rightsjin the Neutral Zone oil Company.

Nor have they succeeded in obtaining a concession from the Saudis, who are asking a high price and |are probably engaged in forcing up the amount to be paid by the Standard Oil Company who have every intention of securing |the Neutral Zone for themselves if they can. 4. The cuestion is therefore whether the political difficulties believed in 1936 to arise if the Sheikh were to ■give a coneession to Petroleum Concessions Limited are still to be apprehended. he are inclined to think they are less serious now that Ibn Saud is assured of an income from the lias a Oil royalties. Moreover it is not clear that Ibn Saud could reasonably object to our allowing Petroleum Concession's' Limited to seek a concession from the Sheikh, and if the Company succeed in winning over the Sheikh it is probable that they would do more to remove than to accentuate the deadlock which was feared in 19 36 and is now partly due to the Sheikh*s refusal to do business. Apart from this, we imagine that the Petroleum Department would be anxious to see Petroleum Concessions Limited’s request granted if it iwould be of benefit to a Company that is not wholly foreign. 5. We should be glad to have your views on the matter. If/If the Company's request is quanted they would he reminded ^hat any concession given by the Sheilch in respect of his interest in the Neutral Zone would be subject to the conclusion of such an agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Company as His Majesty's Government may tlink necessary for the protection of their own interests in the event of the concession becoming operative. 6.

My dear Baggallay, Many thanks for your letter of the 1st June (E.3534/ 63/91) about the desire of Petroleum Concessions Limited to apply for a concession rather than an option over the Kov/eit share of the Neutral Zone. In viev; of your letter, and of Starling 1 s letter of the^SBth May (P.D.745 Part 3), we are informing Longrigg that His Majesty's Government will have no objection if the Company wish to try for a full concession. 2. From his past attitude it seems very unlikely that the Sheikh, who cherishes the ambition to secure for himself the whole of the Neutral Zone, will respond to any overtures from Petroleum Concessions Limited or any other Company. de Gaury, whom we have just seen here, confirms this view. T .7e cannot undertake to try to move the Sheikh from this position. If there were any hope of progress it would more probably lie in Ibn Saud and the Sheikh evolving some arrangement between them. Prima facie, and ggallay, Esq.,, subject/ Foreign Office, S.

Possibly Ibn Saud, if he is really keen, will, without any interventio on our part, take advantage of the Sheik's visit to Riyadh this month to sound him in the matter. if he did so, we v/ould consult the Political Resident as to the attitude to be adopted, in the matter. 3. ?or strategical reasons it would seem expedient that any sources of oil that may exist in the Gulf area more or less under our control should be exploited and we should welcome the development of any oil there may be in the Neutral Zone on this account as well as for the strengthening of Ibn Baud's resources. But If the Shell* ./ere willing to give a concession at all, the position as between Petroleum Concessions Limited and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company if it were a question of a single company acquiring rights over the whole area, would require consideration.4. r - &gt; 3. % I am sending a copy of this letter Jarrett.

FOREIGN OFFICE s S.W.1 B. 3534/68/91). 1st June, 1939 My dear Peel Would yc fer to your letter P.Z.2458/39 of the 11th May regarding the wish of Petroleum Concessions Limited to apply for a concession over the Kov/eit share in the Neutral Zone? i I enclose a copy of a letter of the 15th April from Bullard to Baxter, from which you will see that the Saudi Government are very anxious that the Neutral Zone should be developed and are inclined to think that the American and British interests concerned are obstructive. We feel therefore that it might be a good thing if Petroleum Concessions Limited could induce the Sheikh to give them a concession in respect of his own rights in the Neutral Zone, An approach by the Company to the Sheikh, even if unsuccessful, might make Ibn Saud think that we are as anxious as he to exploit the oil in the Neutral Zone. 4. In these circumstances, we feel that the political difficulties which existed in 1936 have to a large extent lost their force and that it does not really make much difference whether Petroleum Concessions Limited seek, or obtain, an option or a concession from the Sheikh. In fact, owing to the way Ibn Saud has tied himself up with the Californio Arabian Standard Oil Company (as we now know) the grant of a concession by the Sheikh seems an essential preliminary to the working of the Neutral Zone. 5. At the same time it seems that even if the Sheikh does grant a concession there will still be a lot of fences to jump. The next move would presumably be that Ibn Saud would grant a concession in respect of his1 own rights , Company if t ^ by the Sheik: unwilling. 6* If, ; Ibn Saud had the next ste] companies to exploration ( be carried oi the area up l to work throi they decided, the Sheikh ar other profits these two rul which affecte prospects i t c depend for h Zone, which m his rival, bu 7. It is might be obta happen in the (a) (b)ovm rights, either to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company ii they vrere v/illing to cap the terms obtained by the Sheikh, or to some other company if they v/ere unwilling. 6 * If, as a result of all this, the Sheikh and Ion Saud had given concessions to different companies, the next step v/ould presumably have to be for the two companies to agree between themselves hov/ the actual exploration and exploitation of the Neutral Zone was to be carried out. They might or might not decide to divide the area up between them territorially or, alternatively, to work through some joint organisation. But whatever they decided, they would probably have to arrange for the Sheikh and Ibn Saud to receive equal royalties and other profits, for it is, I suppose, improbable that these two rulers would agree to any territorial division which affected either their sovereignty or their financial prospects i^e. neither would be likely to agree to depend for his profits on a certain portion only of the Zone, which might prove better than the portion taken by his rival, but which might also prove \ 70 rse. r/7 * ^ however, conceivable that the concessions might be obtained by the same company and this could happen in the follov/ing two ways, among others: (a) the Sheikh might grant his concession to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company who would presumably be willing to cap their ovm terms in order to obtain Ibn Saud’s concession. (b) California Arabian Standard Oil Company might be unwilling to cap terms granted by the Sheikh to Petroleum Concessions limited and Petroleum Concessions Limitedr 1 It is also pc and Ibn 3aud different frc California Ai 8. The I the view, anc get Ibn Baud We therefore by Petroleum concession, refuse to do likely to gra a concession Baud’s interc that, to othc is most unwe] intention of encouraged a] of deference pressing for the Sheikh, w In fact, it n it might onlji California Ai Equally, as v. Sheikh in his the whole of sole possessi I am Jarrettmight then succeed in securing the concession s —s from Ibn Saud. It is also possible, at least in theory, that the Sheikh and Ibn Gaud might grant concessions to companies quite different from Petroleum Concessions Limited and California Arabian Standard Oil Company, 8, The Foreign Office have in the past held the view, and still do so, that it is most important to get Ibn Saud every additional source of revenue we can. We therefore much hope that the Sheikh will be persuaded by Petroleum Concessions Limited to grant them a concession. 'le realise, however, that he may still refuse to do so. If we thought he would be any more likely to grant California Arabian Standard Oil Company a concession we should not, from the point of view of Ibn Saud’s interests, be sorry if he did so. But we know that, to other departments concerned, this possibility is most unwelcome and we have in the circumstances no intention of suggesting that the Sheikh should be encouraged along these lines. Y7e also refrain, out of deference to the views of the other departments, from pressing for the direct discussions between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh, which Ibn Saud has suggested, to be encouraged. In fact, it may be best to try to ignore this request, as it might only lead to the two of them agreeing to give California Arabian Standard Oil Company a joint concession. Equally, as we realise, it might merely confirm the Sheikh in his determination to sit tight in the hope that the whole of the Neutral Zone will one day come into his sole possession.
