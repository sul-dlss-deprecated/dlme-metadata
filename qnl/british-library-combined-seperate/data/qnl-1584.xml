There is also correspondence with Ottoman officials, including Sayyid Tālib Pasha, mutasarrıf of al-Ḥasā’, and various Hindu merchants, including Tekchand Dwarkadas, Thawerdas Janimal and Seth Chatamal Tarachand.The file concerns the status and mistreatment of Hindu merchants (
                           bunniahs) resident in and trading with al-Qaṭīf, dating back to 1900. In a letter dated 2 August 1903, John Calcott Gaskin, Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain, gives a detailed report concerning commercial operations between Bahrain and al-Qaṭīf and the status of Hindu merchants trading in dried dates with complaints being made against the customs farmer (folios 24-27). In a further piece of correspondence dated 9 April 1904, it is claimed that Hindu merchants are descriminated against and made to pay 12% duty by the customs farmer at al-Qaṭīf (folios 43-44).Similar incidents are reported in subsequent years. Also in 1904 there are enquiries by various Hindu merchants about opening businesses in al-Qatif and the possibility of British protection, including a petition by the principal Hindu merchants of Bahrain (folios 51-53). There is further correspondence in 1905 and 1906 with representations to Sayyid Tālib Pasha (folios 66-69), and the Sublime Porte to resolve the situation (folios 84-85).Also included within the file are copies of Tekchand Dwarkadas's accounts (folios 128-149); a report on the status of Hindu merchants trading with al-Qaṭīf (folios 178-180); a report concerning the absence of Hindu merchants in al-Hafūf, al-‘Uqayr, Najd, and Qatar (folios 182-183); the opening of a shop at al-Qaṭīf by Seth Chatamal Tarachand of Messrs Gangaram Tikamdas &amp; Co. in 1910 (folios 184-193); and the situation of Hindu merchants at al-Qaṭīf after Eastern Arabia had been taken by ‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd (Ibn Sa‘ūd) in 1912 (folios 194-195).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002f7#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002f7#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002f7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
