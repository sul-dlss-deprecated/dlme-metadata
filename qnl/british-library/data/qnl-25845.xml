CC/DV © Since the outbreak of war we have from time to time received telegrams from the Political Agent at Bahrein to the effect that there is no local objection to the grant of visas to the wives, children and fiancees of personnel employed by the California Standard Oil Company in Bahrein, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining shipping accommodation the persons concerned have been unable to proceed. The California Standard Oil Company have now informed us that they may be able to arrange passages for some of the women at very short notice, and enquire whether the authority granted by the Political Agent would still hold good. The Passport t Permit Office would be glad to be advised in view of the lapse of time since the receipt of the telegraphic communications referred to, whether the Political Agent at Bahrein should be consulted before the grant of visas on such applications. After I had discussed this with you, I spoke to Mr. Courtice. He tells me that the telegrams mentioned in the first paragraph of his reference .all relate to named individuals. The procedure is that an employee of the Oil Company applies to the Political Agent regarding a visa for his wife etc; and the Political Agent then telegraphs to the Passport Office that there is no objection to the granting of a visa. He also told me that there is no general policy of discouraging people from travelling to this part of the Middle East. In these circumstances I told him that we did not consider that there was any need for the political Agent to be consulted again. He said that he did not need a written reply to his reference. 21st October, 1941 Mr. Gibson, Political Department, INDIA OFFICE. Mr. Pg4l . H-K- (M2994] 25376/144 1,000m 3/33 700 G*.

There seems to be good circumstantial evidence that Italian planes were over Dibai on the 16/17th November. It is quite likely that they had intended to make Bahrain but got off their course. This seems to dispose of theories such as:- (a) that the Italians did not really mean to go to Bahrain when they set out on their first bombing expedition; (b) that it was only done for propaganda and to cause us to disperse strength, and is not likely to happen again; and (c) that there is no really serious danger to the Bahrain Refinery. 2.

Bombing of DhahranTelegram to Ohliger from Jedda Ootober 21 at 194 Q» 1940 j Acting on orders from King Krince Kaisal arrived Jed a night of 19th and yeeterday eummoned the Jiritish inieter and afterwards the Italian Minister to the Palace. Thie morning He j ib gave me following vereion of meet^-ng between Faieal and Italian Minieter. Alien confronted with news of bombing of Dhahran Italian Minister expressed complete ignorance and stated that it was undoubtedly act oi British done with purpose of arousing Arab animosity against Italians. Faisal replied that Bahrain also had been bombed and that he could not conceive of British bombing their own oil fields and installa tions and that he was convinced that both Bahrain and )hahran were bomced by Italian planes. At that point message was handed to Faisal stating Home Kadio had officially announced Italian boobing of Bahrain. Italian Minister expressed deepest sorrow stating that bombing of Dhahran was clearly done by mistake and added tViat because he knew policy of his Government he could give Faisal firmest assurances that such a mistake would never be made in future. Faisal answered that these personal assur ances were insufficient and that oflicial assurances of the Italian Government were required. This the Italian Minister promised to obtain and the meeting ended. Thereafter the Itcdian Minister coded a lengthy wire to Rome which was handed to Faisal for despatching. The wire was sent last evening. Nejib then added that Kaiaal is personally convinced that Dhahran was bombed by mistake and that no such mistake would be made in future. Because of this conviction Faisal feels according to Ilejib that the Company acted too hurriedly in suspend ng work. Also according to Nejib Faisal plans to oall roe to Palace after receiving oflicial assurances of /Italian© I r-~\ JvJf • 2 - Ital lan Govermasnt and to inform me that since these aaeurances are acceptable to the Saudi Arabian Government they should also be acceptable to Company and consequently the Company should resume its work. From other surces X was given identical report of Faisal's convictions and plans. Also this morning British Minister called with Legation’s^ telegram of Bahrain and ~)hahran bombings which he read. There after he explained that during hie meeting with iraisal he had expressed opinion that Italians had at xirst mistaken xhahran for Bahrain and had dropped their bombs before realising the mistake. He added however that he was peisonally of the opinion that no mistake had been made arid that he had given the above explanation to Faisal because he felt that the w»audi Arabian Government preferred to believe that Dhahran bombing was a mistake and because he felt it was better at t is time that they did believe it was a mistake. However he later expressed the conviction that the bombing was done as a propaganda measure which is rather inconsistent with the expression of the belief that !)hahran bombing was intentional. This might be explained by desire that we regard the bombing as intentional. - LSNAHAN. &gt;Wfth the Comp of th© / Under Secretary ©f for Foreign AfPai M .f zeti/jos-A*-) 7 DFC '^O ft # ' , 9 ? • *♦ -, * * a. .'

I thought there could be no objection, on the contrary publication of statement that pilots had mistaken their target would show up Italians even more clearly as consummate liars and incredibly incompetent navigators. 3.

Faisal asked the Minister, how then,he explained the bombing of Bahrein by the same formation. Signor Sillitti, unaware that Bahrein had been bombed, was dumbfounded and said the Dahran bombing must have been accidental, he was av/are of his Government^ policy and a similar mistake would not recur. Amir Faisal was not satisfied and demanded official apology and guarantee from the Italian Government. Requested Italian Minister to draft telegram immediately and hand it to him for transmission to Rome. This was done. 3.
