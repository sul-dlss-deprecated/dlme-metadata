## Do Not Harvest

After my meeting I'm happy to say that we're excited to collaborate with you all. 
For some collections we're contacting donors and working with curators, but overall 
we're happy to have collection materials on the DLME.

The photo collections are a bit complicated since some have agreements with other institutions, 
but I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Collections that are free to federate now are: 
AUC Historical Videos, Taxiphote slides, Historical Maps, Hassan Fathy, Ramses Wissa Wassef, 
Napoleonic Egypt, UOTS (no oral histories to be included though), AUC Student Newspapers 
(we still have fifteen years to add, fyi), Islamic Art and Architecture slides, Selections, 
Qurna, Bint al-Nil, AUC News Items (some items are clearly ok, like AUC publications, but 
the newspaper clippings I'm not sure about. I've seen some institutions make them available and 
others restrict them).
