The majority of the file focuses on the activities of two US citizens, Charles Calmer Hart (a former US Minister to Iran) and the petroleum geologist Frederick Gardner Clapp, as well as the activities of the Amiranian Oil Company. The file includes copies of agreements and Persian (Iranian) Government bills (in French) relating to the granting of concessions, along with a map illustrating the extent of the concession (f 41). Correspondence from 1938 onwards reports on the withdrawal of the Amiranian Oil Company from Persia, and the renouncement of their concession (ff 2-19).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Frederick Gardner Clapp</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Charles Calmer Hart</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Amiranian Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Persia</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000029#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000029#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000029#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000029#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
