Isis strides left, her right hand clasping the wrist of her left in a gesture of mourning. She is shown wearing a thin two halter costume with no top. A broad collar, bag wig and two bracelets complete the costume. The figure is flanked on either side by a column of hieroglyphs.\r\nCondition: The panel is lacking both lower left and right hand corners. A horizontal crack runs across the panel 2/3 of the way down, cutting the Isis figure at the thigh. An open dowel hole exists in the panel to the left of the Isis, at shoulder level. The background is of a light yellow, some of which has been rubbed away \u2013 especially at the top. Isis\u2019 brilliant white garment and drab green skin (all outlined in red and black), are well preserved. The same is true for the inscriptions.", "medium": "Wood, pigment", "dimensions": "14 3/16 x 12 5/8 in.
