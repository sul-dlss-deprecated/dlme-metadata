The first note mentions the Extradition Act 1870, the India Extradition Act 1903, the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 and the various Orders in Council relating to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. The question arose in connection with the famous case of the British-born American financier Samuel Insull (born 1859, died 1938). Following the collapse of his business empire during the Great Depression, Samuel Insull travelled to Europe. In 1934 he was arrested in Istanbul and sent back to the United States of America under an extradition treaty with Turkey, in order to stand trial for fraud and other offences.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Samuel Insull</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Deportation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000179#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
