Much of the correspondence is with the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO). The documents submitted for registration are principally certificates for oil company shipments, but also include title deeds, powers of attorney, passport applications, certificates of residency, and certification of change of name.There is also some correspondence about the need to be able to recognise the Political Agent's signature in the course of his notarial duties (e.g. folios 9-11).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Notarial instruments</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00032d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00032d#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00032d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
