Khairuddin Khan is the father of all three. Najmuddin Khan is a man of 1 no importance and a spend-thrift and if the property is in ! his hands it is most unlikely that Jamal uddin and his brothers will ever see anything of it as Najmuddin would in all pro bability dispose of it as soon as possible. Also he is not on good terms with the family of Khan Sahib Badruddin Khan* Jamal uddin suggested that the property should be placed in charge of an agent appointed by His Britannic llajesty’s Ccnsul General, Kashgar. It was explained to him that in the view of the Consul General the Chinese authorities were most unlikely to alter their order. C&lt;&lt;1 Jamaluddin also asked for information about a property it+y belonging to his father (bought in the name of the late Faiz Mohammad Khan eldest son of Badruddin Khan ana his 3 brothers and their mother Hajira Bibi) situated in village Tosala J l ^enghe Chankash Saksan Kanti about two miles outside Khotan which the family took refuge when they were first turned out * 4 w # SrAp** Khotan. Jamaluddin said that there was 80 Makars land Mahar*approximately 1 X 500) with a house garden fruit trees valued at &amp;. 50,000/-. They also left some of their % ^Ji^moveable property valued at Bs* 1100/- in the house*. This /♦ /vM ^ ^ A) nnR o on r5 OQT*rlpn had not. Louse and garden had not been compulsorily taken over before they were driven out, as was their property in Khotan. 3. I would request that the action taken by the Government of India in the matter may kindly be intimated to me so that I may be able to inform the members of the family of late 'Khan Sahib Badruddin Khan who now contemplate going to Rawal pindi where they hope to be able to start a small business with the compassionate grant promised by Govemnment. I hope that further efforts will be possible to obtain for them some compensation for their losses in Khotan.

The Government of India will be glad to hear what has happened to the property mentioned in the last part of paragraph 2 of the Resident’s letter. 3* Although you stated in your Memorandum No;510, dated the 4th January 1940 that it is unlikely that the Chinese authorities will agree to any alteration in the arrangements they have made for the disposal of the property, the Government of India are inclined to think that it might be worth while making one last effort to secure the agreement of the local authorities to the suggestion that the property should be placed in charge of an agent appointed by you. It might be pointed out to the local authorities that in view of the relations between Najmuddin Khan and the rest of the family, it is unlikely that they will get their share of the property and that in the interests of justice it seems most desirable that the property should be disposed of by an agent appointed by the Consul General. 4. If your approach to the Sinkiang authorities has no result, perhaps it might be possible to bring pressure to bear on Najmuddin Khan. If, however, it is impossible to get any satisfaction either out of the local authorities or Najmuddin Khan the Government of India will be glad to know the amount of compensation which you think should be paid to the family from the Tungan gold taking into consideration the extent of their financial losses in Sinkiang. Copy of letter No:S30, dated the 4th July, 1940 from His Majesty’s Consul General, Kashgar to the Additional Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, Simla. SUBJECT ; Affairs of the family of the late Khan Sahib Badruddin Khan. A reference is invited to~your letter No:F*6(2)-X/39, dated the 25th April, 1940. 2. Letter No:308(WAl) dated the 12th December 1939 from the Kashgar Commissioner, a copy of which was forwarded with my letter No:510 dated the 4th January 1940 implied that all property in the Khotan area of the family of the late Khan Sahib Badruddin Khan had been handed over to Najmuddin Khan and Khair Nisa Khan. This is confirmed by the statement of a British subject who left Khotan some four months after the expulsion of the family who states that the property in village Tosla Menghe Chankash Saksan Kil Kanti was handed over to these people* 3* I regret to say that the suggestion that the property of the family of the late Khan Sahib Badruddin Khan in the Khotan area should be handed over to an agent appointed by this Consulate-General is not a feasible one. For months ^ past Khotan has been quite isolated from Kashgar; travellers are not permitted to go there and I am unaware of any British subject suitable for taking charge of the property. Nor is it likely that any would have the temerity to do so* 4* I could write to the Chinese authorities asking them to instruct Najmuddin Khan and Khair Nisa Khan to realize ..the property in question and send the proceeds to this Consulate- GeneralConsulate-General for payment to the heirs of the late Klian Sahib. I think, however, that this course might not meet the wishes of the heirs who would realize. (a) That Najmuddin Khan and Khair Nisa Khan are unlikely to deal honestly by them and even if they sent any money would send only a nominal amount (supervision tx is not possible)• (b) That any hopes they might have of recovering their property or some portion thereof in the future would disappear. 5. I think, therefore, that the family had better be paid compensation from the Tungan gold. Jamaluddin now claims that the value of their property in Tosala Menghe Chankash Saksan Kanti was Rs. 50,000/- plus Rs. 1,100/-. But in previous applications which are on my file he claimed as the value Ks. 25,000/- and Rs. 1,100/-. He is obviously prone to exaggerate. I suggest that they be paid half of the original claim viz., Rs. 12,500/- plus Ps. 550/- for the losses in Tosala Menghe Chankash Saksan Kanti. In addition I suggest d. 10,000/- for other losses sustained in Knot an city, on the journey etc., making a total of Rs. 23,050*which would be in addition to grants already made.

With some slight improvements political position and outlook in Iraq remain as set forth in my telegram No. 115 of the 6th February (repeated to Cairo under No. 35). RashidWTIi has been active' and there has been talk of InTlitary plots but fear of a coup seems on the whole to have diminished and there has been unusually outspoken criticism.in Chamber and Senate both of military incursions into politics and of failure.of. late Government to maintain good relations with Great Britain. Prime Minister has definitely discouraged anti-British propaganda but has not otherwise responded to my suggestions for a positive pro-British lead. Minister for Foreign Affairs hints that if' General Taha cannot deal adequately with situation he will with- .draw his own support in due course but meanwhile he also no doubt prefers to await external and internal developments for as long as may be permitted. Change of Government would be liable to . precipitate crisis which should however be shorter and less dangerous than the last one. 5. Amongst specific questions likely to come up for discussion are following. A. SEVERANCE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN IRAQ, AND ITALY. This is connected with question of preventing anti-British interventions into politics by certain officers or whom leader is Colonel Salah-ud-din. I have nothing to add to telegrams recently exchanged (telegram from Foreign Office No. 116 to B agdad, repeated to Cairo NOo 361, as amended in paragraph 4 By my telegram to loti Foreign Office No. 149. re peated to Cairo No. 45, and by my lofoi*. telegrams Nos. 148. 19Q_and 191 r epeated to Cairo under Nos. iU,uiiv»fe.44, 59 and 60).

Minister...2. &gt; Minister for Foreign Affairs has had considerable difficulties in obtaining this, or indeed any, decision and I am not sure/-^^. that these difficulties have been finally overcome although Taufiq Suv/aidi maintains that they have. A word of appreciation from you might help and, as I have telegraphed separately, I think Colonel Smith should call on Minister for Foreign Affairs in Cairo. D. PALESTINE. Taufiq Suwaidi has shown sympathy with recent proposal ^ of mine for persuading Palestinian exiles to returnc Un fortunately High Commissioner foresees difficulty in giving necessary assurance that prosecution for old offences will be time-barred and I am waiting to learn fromToreign Office whether progress with proposal can be made. (See my telegrams Nos, .152 a nd 17/ and Jerusalem telegram NOo21_ Saving to Colonial T)ffice”JT ' •Taufiq Suwaidi is a keen pan-Arab but has not otherwise discussed Palestine or Syria perhaps because he, like the ex-Mufti, may appreciate that Great Britain is wholly absorbed in more pressing matters and must also pay regard to Jewish influence in America. (See my telegram No. 185 repe ated to Cairo as No, 55). Prime Minister once mentioned Palestine to me and I replied as reported in my telegram No. 121 to Foreign Office, (repeated to Cairo under No. 42). —“ * _ E, Taufiq Suwaidi will want all the information you can give him about Turkey, the Balkans and.Russiao He has been considerably impressed by the Soviet disapproval of events In Bulgaria. Although I have told him that I know nothing of-any arrangement between Great Britain and Turkey affecting ' Northern Iraq and that there is doubtless nothing to know, he is anxious for an official denial. Rumours, as I reminded Taufiq, have long been spread by Axis propaganda and the Iraqis (as I did not say to Taufiq) are the more ready to believe them because they realise that such an arrangement would be a fitting sequel to their own disloyal behaviour.o irw .|-j| c CQPY r 1J0 1 in' *&gt; jL*r~A'~ 11 1 j j y-f - .

Failure of the Regent to secure army support at starting stages made his position almost hopeless for the moment. ixlthough he is attempting to contact support the process must necessarily he slow. Counsellor has brought back the Regent s letters which are being delivered to various supporters m Bagdad. . ^ . .3. Regent fails to appreciate the difficulties of getting his suppprters to come into the open now and join him. His present idea appears to be to obtain the resignation of.Taha by letter and then to form new Cabinet. I do not think he has any chance of success. I fear that the Regent expects too much from his broadcast, reception of which appears to have been extremely limited. Distribution of 4,000 copies of summarized text through the Embassy has been effected. For tactical reasons I am holding up further publicity pending £gpl^ to my telegram No. 2£L L__ 'Failure on our part to support the Regent by force immediately would evidently come as a rude shock to him but the blow might be softened if we explain that the lack of support owing to present uncertainty elsewhere does not mean the abandonment of his cause. n „ 4.

He had learnt that their plan was to summon the *Parliament*(if necessary securing the attendance of a quorum by threat and bribe) to dooose the Regent and to set up Regency Council of three under the presidency of Sherrif Sharaf (a minor member of Sherrefian family who acted as Regent during the late King Feisal s absence and who has since then been living in Bagdad in the palace). Both Taha and Naii Suwaidi were already Being pressed to join this Council but had so far refused. Rashid All was also trying to form a Cabinet. He had &lt; not yet persuaded any of reputable parties to join it but he would fill it with second rate extremists if better men could not be found. Taufiq Suwaidi said that the army leaders were convinced that Germany would win and that it was therefore necessary to follow a policy with a steady inclination towards the AxiSo Taufiq gave it as his opinion that boycotting of Government of National Defence by leading politicians would not defeat Rashid Ali and he took the line that only force could now do this. He said that he and.otner ex colleagues ve s anxious to know whether His Majesty s Government intended to come to an understanding with .

I have found the Regent at Habbaniya on my arrival yesterday afternoon and had short talk with him before coming here. As it was probably my only opportunity of seeing him for some time, I was obliged to give him advice before I had studied the local situation but developments of last few hours and my conversations since my arrival have not * caused me to modify * views which I expressed. mu ^ thought the hour of compromise had passed. The Army Chiefs and Rashid Ali were evidently determined to seize power and either turn him our or make him a puppet. So far as my information went the majority of the population and a considerable part of the army were favouraule to him but this feeling was likely to wane if he did not take immediate steps to rally them. I therefore.supported his intention of proceeding to Basra and encouraged him to take stroug and energetic action to restore the situation. I approved his intention to form new Cabinet with Ali Jaudat or Jamii Madfai as Prime Minister, to summon the Chamber and Senate to Basra in order to obtain their public support of his cause, to issue an appeal to the nation and to promise an amnesty to any officers and men of the army who had been obliged to act disloyally, on condition that they renounce the army leaders whose dismissal he proposed publicly to announce. With these and other measures which would be necessary as the situation developed he thought that there was a good chance of obtaining such a strong display of popular synpathy that revolutionaries would collapse through lack of s^rvpo'rt 3. I share his opinion that the situation can be saved but only if he takes immediate and strong action. Unfortunately owing to weather conditions he could not leave for Basra until this afternoon. Ali Jaudat went with him. Whether he and his supporters will really act with energy and decision remains to be seen. They seem to nave been singularly negligent in making plans to meet a situation which has been staring them in the faces for weeks. _ His adherents here have gone to ground so I can do little to influence the situation but I propose to fly to Basra in a few days if a new Cabinet is formed in order to go through the ritual of presentation [grp. undec.] credentials. 5.

I have not yet had an appreciation from Mr. Holman of the position m Bas::a hut the whole - situation appears to have been radically changed by the [grp. undec. ] army there and flight of the Regent,to -H.'M,S 'Cockchafer'*. He does not seem to : have altogether lost heart but I see few signs of growing public support in his favour and his chances of putting up an effective resistance have obviously been greatly minimised. jThey may [? indeed] be said to be negligible if he is not ^;assisted by the armed forces of His Majesty’s Government. 2o It seems that there are three courses open to His Ma jesty’s Government: (1) Restore the situation by armed intervention. [? Head of] Military Mission, and adviser to Ministry^of the Interior still consider that majority of the population, although it does not dare come into the open, is friendly to 'Great Britain and that action, if taken soon, would only have to be directed against dissidenT^portion of~the Iraqi army. General Ymterhouse thinks that strong aerial measures against the army nr Bagdad supported by mechanised land forces would be sufficient. As regards the early future, Rashid Ali will obviously do his utmost to strengthen his hold over the .country by intimidation and bribes: a large influx of German |(|specialists from Iran must be anticipated and it is probable that after a few months, operations on a much more comprehensive scale would be necessary to restore the situation. If it is decided to take early offensive action, it will be necessary m tbe first instance to remove the foreign community REG*. POL. DEPt. -8 *-PR 941 INDIA OFFICE from/from Iraq. './omen and children would have to go first and I doubt if they could he cleared under a fortnight. In such a ^ case I would recommend that Kis Majesty’s Government should - inform Rashid i^li that they did not intend to have any official relations with his regime, that they were_ considering what measures were necessary to protect their interests and treaty rights and that as a mark of their lack of confidence they were taking steps to remove the British community. (2) To inform Rashid Ali that they will have no official relations with his regime and to squeeze him as much as possible. I have been too short a time in the country to make a confident prediction of consequences of such an attitude. I imagine that our failure to support the Regent and Constitution would react very unfavourably on our prestige and that we would have a difficult row to hoe. I would 1 anticipate resumption of.relations by Iraq with Germany or appearance of many German nationals. I would expect to see Iraq fall rapidly under Nazi influence. On the other hand I very much doubt if such a change would be to the liking of the population. Germans would find it difficult to bring more resources here and we could always have at the back of our minds the possibility of restoring the situation by force when it suited our convenience. (3) To recognise the regime of Rashid Ali. In view of what we know of him I dismiss this as unthinkable. My personal view is in favour of the first of these three courses but I realise that it may not be possible to spare the necessary forces and that our policy here must be subordinated to wider issues.FILE COPY [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept With the Compliment* of the Und-w Seo« ?t»ry o?

Two 'proclamations were broadcast yesterday evening from the Bagdad station and published in the press this morning. The first is by the Chief of the General Staff. It begins by accusing the Regent of having sought to win loyalty to himself and to make a bid for the throne put in his 1 trust, to destroy the army and to create factions among the people and it goes on to say that the Regent disregarded all advice to mend his ways, ignored contemptuously the rights of the nation and thereby incurred general displeasure* Accordingly the control of the affairs of the nation has been entrusted t&lt;? a Government of National Defence under the leadership of Rashid Ali A1 Gilani who enjoys the confidence of the whole nation and who is capable of safe-guarding the independence of the country. The army have asked him to undertake this responsibility until constitutional steps can be taken in a peaceful atmosphere when normal conditions have been re-established. l..e proclamation ends with an appeal to the people to co operate with the new regime. The second proclamation is by Rashid All. It states that as a result of the Regent s xailure to carry out his duties properly Rashid All had been asked to make’ over the control of the state by the army and has accepted in the interests of the nation. It goes on to say that the programme of the Government of t National Defence will be the same as that of Rashid All s last cabinet which was based on keeping the country out of the war, the fulfilment of Iraq s racial mission and the up-holdihg of her international obligations, in particular the Anglo-Iraqi ireaty..

Honourable Iraqi Nation. You are doubtless aware of the regretable events caused by a small number of Iraqi army officers two days ago, who unjustifiably threatened His Excellency Taha Al Hashimi the Prime Minister and obliged him to tender his resignation, without realising that this resignation, could not be regarded as legitimate unless approved by us by virtue of the provisions of the organic law which is the mature outcome of the sacred Iraqi rebirth and the symbol of the independence of country. Regardless of the dire consequences those few individuals have set on foot this reckless movement at a critical moment which demands the co-operation of the people of the country if danger is to be avoided. Brave Iraqi”Nation v heedless of Iraqi public ooinion, Rashid Ali Al Gailani has set out to seize power by instigating those rebellious elements who have adopted falsehood as a weapon for their distortion of the facts with a view to throwing dust in the eyes of the people and showing themselves zealous for the interests of the country. In fact they are nothing but an instrument in the hands of foreigners who in order to enjoy the benefits of the country seek the destruction of its independence. You will of course realise that we are entrusted'v/ith the defence of the constitution and we must therefore guard it to the best of our ability, and should not allow any infringement of it whatsoever. Accordingly I was obliged to leave the capital after my residence had been surrounded by the followers of Rashid Ali. That residence I feel sure is duly respected by all true Iraqis. I would have liked to address the nation earlier had I had the means to do so. I am confident that in view of the natriotism of the Iraqi people and its loyalty to the throne the nation will reject these rebellious elements who have given themselves free rein and have consistently exposed the security of the whole country to danger. I desire therefore to remind you the generous Iraqi Nation of the eloquent words addressed by my grandfather the late King Hussein to the Iraqi delegates on the occasion of the latter’s visit to him to ask for his approval of the nomination of my late uncle His Majesty King Faisal 1st to the Throne. On this occasion he said 'I am prepared to agree to the request of the delegates, but I hope tnat his/ate may not be similar to that of his forefathers'Hussen'.

Rashid Ali this morning gave the followin oi his position to Adviser to Ministry of the Taha had resigned and had refused to carry on until new Government was formed. Regent had disappeared so no new Government could be set up constitutionally. In these circumstances the army, as de facto source of authority, had asked him to take over the administration of the country temporarily and to direct public security pending formation of constitutional Government. Rashid Ali affirmed what he called his '’fidelity to Anglo^Ira^i alliance' and mentioned that his action had been inspired solely by consideration for the welfare of the country. He claimed that he had consulted all available ex-Ministers who had unanimously urged him to assume control. Position was very different from [?grp. omtd.: that] describedto me by Taufiq Suwaidi. He said that it was 'Rashid Ali and his mob of friends who had made it impossible for the late Government to continue in office or even carry on after the Prime Minister’s resignation until another Government had been formed. It was moreover Rashid Ali who had devised plan that he should himself govern as mandate for the army and who had insisted on carrying out this plan in spite.of appeals of most of the responsible men in public life including Naune Suwaidi. Rashid Ali’s intention now seems to be to extort from the Regent ah irada making him Prime Minister or failing that to force the Regent to resign.

IMMEDI ATE. hhh TT^re found the Regent at Habbaniya on my arrival yesterday afternoon and had short talk with him before coming here. As it was probably my only opportunity of seeing him for some time, I was obliged to give him advice before I had studied the local situation but developments of last few hours and.my conversations since my arrival have not been on those t_2 grps. undec.] f?lines of] views which I expressed. 2. I told hi.., I thought the hour .of compromise had passed. The Army Chiefs and Rashid Ali were evidently determined to seize power and either turn him out or make him a puppet. So far as my information went the majority of the population and a considerable part of the army were favourable to him but this feeling was likely to wane if he did not take immediate steps to rally them. I therefore supported his intention of proceeding to Basra and encouraged him to take strong and energetic action to restore the situation. I approved his intention to form new Cabinet with Ali Jaudat or Jajnil Madfai as Prime Minister, to summon the Chamber and Senate to ’Basra In order to obtain their public support of his cause, to issue an appeal to the nation and to promise an amnesty to any officers and men of the army who had been obliged to act disloyally, on condition that they renounce the army leaders whose dismissal he proposed publicly to announce. With these and other measures which ‘would be necessary as the situation developed he thought that there was a good chance of obtaining such a strong display of opular sympathy that revolutionaries would collapse .rough lack of support. -pi P 0 th 5. I share his opinion that the situation can be saved but only if he takes immediate and strong action. Unfortunately owing to weather conditions ue could not leave Basra until this afternoon.

They*They seem to have heen singularly negligent in making plans to meet a situation which has been staring them in the face for weeks.

SECRET Regent yesterday sent me news that a few days ago an order had been issued transferring Kamil Shabib (one of the four leaders of military clique) to Mwanmajh to the command of division there and that he refused to obey. The Prime Minister had thereupon asked the Regent to receive these four officers, to accept apology from them and thereafter to consider the affair of their conduct during the last crisis as closed. Regent had not accepted this proposal. This morning I visited Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister who gave me a different account of the situation. They stated that the Prime Minister had refused request of the four officers to cancel the order transferring Kamil Shabib to Diwanmajh but that Kamil had been granted three weeks leave as the officer commanding Diwanmajh had advised that owing to Rashid Ali’s intrigues among local tribes a change of commanders was for the moment inexpedient. Prime Minister assured me that in the meantime Kamil was not in command of his former division. The Minister for Foreign Affairs explained that the Government felt obliged to proceed cautiously in dealings with military clique because Rashid Ali .was trying to organise new political party and they did not wish to have too much on their hands at once. The Government had decided to refuse permission for the formation of this party. Shortly after my return from these visits the Regent sent me further message to the effect that the Prime Minister with [grp. unde. J and the Presidents of the Senate and Chamber had all visited the Palace this morning and had endeavoured to persuade/* j r, l ' c, n 2, persuade him to ‘accept'’ the Prime Minister’s proposal about the ^ officers but that he had not consented. Neither the Prime Minister nor Minister for Foreign Affairs told me of the incident though it had taken place only short time before I Saw them. I shall see the Regent tomorrow. The Prime Minister assured me that there was no danger of military action and that he was master of the situation.

I suggest that he might profit from the audience given to the officers to obtain from them unconditional promises to obey orders and eschew politics in future and use these promises to clinch the transfer of Kamil Shabib and expedite the dismissal of the officers. I pointed out that the latter promise.would provide the officers with a line of retreat from the position which they had previously taken up- in regard to the j-talian Legation, and I repeated to him the observation which I had made to the [gr.undec.

Since it was decided in far less favourable circumstances and in the face of much greater risks to force the pace with Rashid Ali, our position and that of our friends in Iraq has been ftuch strengthened. As always, it is really a choice of risks which is involved and if we now blow hot and cold and hesitate to pursue to an effective conclusion the policy steadily followed now for some months, our influence will suffer and our enemies will be correspondingly encouraged. Whenever they feel strong enough, they will instigate 'violent ! reactions' but Rashid Ali failed to promote such reactions and since then his influence, that of the military clique, and even that of the Mufti seems to have been weakening partly owing to I our firm policy. These elements may recover strength if we now change or suspend this policy. Its maintenance, no doubt, involves risks to which I have been careful throughout to draw attention, but the worst that might happen would seem ■ to be temporary control of Bagdad by the military clique who would find it difficult to maintain their illegal control. No such mutiny is in fact anticipated. 5. stroii' Although Regent does not believe military clique to be strong, if he did decide to absent himself from Bagdad, he would take that decision because he considered that he would be playing into his enemies hands if he failed to remove himself from area in which the clique exercised military authority, and if he failed to take such opportunities as he could for depriving them of power.,4. I suggest, therefore, that we •■shall he incurring a very direct.and grave responsibility if we advise him not to take steps which he considers to be desirable for his [? own] integrity and .for the good of his-.country* His visit to Basra would not of itself constitute any provocation but be represented as. visit which is normal and indeed overdue. 5* y repetition of my telegrams to Foreign Office;'- I have kept Cairo fully informed of the way in which the situation has been developing and of the risks involved - see', in particular my telegram Ho. 113 of February 6th, paragraph 4 of my telegram No. 148 of February 19th and paragraph 2 of my telegram unnumbered Saving to Cairo of March 5th.

I am happy to state now that the talks which I had with the British Foreign Minister were sincere and frank and satisfactory to both sides. Our review of the present situation in the Middle East confirmed the necessity for co-operation between the two Allies in accordance with both the spirit and the letter of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. Though Iraq desires to be absolutely faithful to her treaty obligations, it is obvious that she finds it in her interests to remain always far removed from the horrors of war. At the same time, there should be no doubt that Iraq is deeply interested in all that conduces to assure liberty and independence to the Arab countries of the fertile crescent. Contracts inspired with mutual good faith and sincerity must always have good results in removing doubts and increasing good understanding, and that in effect is what happened in my talks in Cairo 1 *.

ONE of the main difficulties which your Excellency will have to face in the execution of your mission in Iraq consists in the intense interest taken by the more politically-minded section of Iraqis in Arab affairs outside their own country, particularly in His Majesty's Government’s Palestine policy, and in such questions as the future of Syria and the possibility of Arab Federation.' 2. This interest has been exploited by German propaganda. On the 1st October last an official declaration was issued by the German Government to the effect that Germany has always sympathised with the Arab question and hoped that the Arabs will one day regain their position in the world, which will honour their race and their great history. It was added that the German Government have followed with interest the struggle for independence in the Arab countries, and that in that struggle the Arabs can rely unhesitatingly on entire German sympathy. The declaration concluded by stating that in this matter Germany was in full accord with her ally Italy. 3. It should have been obvious, and Sir Basil Newton has on several occasions drawn the attention of leading Iraqis to this point, that the German Government carefully confined themselves in this declaration to the most general terms, and avoided undertaking obligations of any kind. Doubtless, however, in their oral propaganda they have gone much further than vague expressions of sympathy, and the enthusiasm, which they have certainly succeeded in arousing in some influential Iraqi circles, is by no means solely due to the bribes which they have lavishly distributed, but is also inspired by the genuine belief that pan-Arab hopes and ambitions may be realised in due course with German assistance. 4. In the making of promises to the Arabs, it is not possible for His Majesty’s Government, in view of their international obligations and strategic requirements, to compete with the German Government. I am, however, most anxious that you should be in a position to combat enemy influence so far as possible, and that you should make every effort to build up in Iraq an effective body of opinion which will look to His Majesty’s Government, not Germany, as the natural friend of the Arabs and the champion of their legitimate aspirations. The British record in Iraq should provide you with the best arguments to use m this connexion, but you will no doubt wish to know what line \ou may take on the three questions referred to in paragraph 1 above, namely, Palestine, Syria and Arab Federation, both when speaking officially and in private conversation. 5. Palestine—On the question of Palestine you may say that His Majesty’s Government do not see any reason to make any change in their policy as laid down in the white paper of 1939. and that it remains unchanged. 6. You should not volunteer any further information, but, if questioned regarding the implementation of that policy, you should point out that important steps have already been taken to put it into effect. Immigration and land sales are in fact already being regulated in accordance with the provisions of the white paper His Majesty’s Government are making strenuous efforts to reduce illegal immigration in every possible way. As your Excellency will be aware, it has often in practice proved impossible to deport illegal immigrants to their country of origin, since they have taken care to destroy all documents regarding their identity. However, the number of these illegal immigrants whom it has been found necessary to retain in Palestine has been deducted from the total permitted under the white paper. Moreover, some 1.600 illegal immigrants were recently sent to Mauritius for detention during the period of hostilities and it has been announced that it is not proposed that they should, at the end of the war, remain in that colony or go to Palestine. The total figure for immigrants [15—32] ltKOft.POL.Mf»T. 26MAR 941 INDIA OFFICE2 m 7. of all categories (including illegal immigrants) since April 19 /® ls *P p ™e'er 30,000. The white paper provided for a total immigration sp^ad over five years, and there seems therefore no particular ground foi alarm amon 0 Arabs on ^ t g h j,g^“j constitutional development, the white paper states explicitly that thetrstTep viz., the appointment^ a few PalesUnmn h^ds of depar^ mpntq will onlv take place “ when peace and order have been sumcientiy lestoiea in Palestine ” ^t is recognised that conditions in Palestine have greatly improved from the security point of view, but you should explain that even so, it will probably beTun^d fmpract.cable to embark on constitutional and administrat ve changes of this nature under war conditions, particularly since, m spite oi the lecelft British successes against Italy. Palestine --t be r^arikcl as closely involved in the military operations in the Middle Last. While F J J Government hope and expect that, when the war is ended, conditions in 1 ales a will permit the various steps of constitutional development to follow upon^ne another in orderly succession on the lines already laid down, they feel that these conditions afford adequate iustification for delay at present. • 8 I have no doubt that you will frequently be asked in private conversat for an expression of your own personal views regarding the likelihood of a ha _ to that of the Jews. In reply to such enquiries yo should ‘hat you see reason to suppose that His Majesty’s Government Gwerm announced in 1939.

His Majesty’s Government therefore would not wish to oppose the principle of “ Arab Federation ” if the matter were ever to be raised in a practical torm.

Cornwallis (Bagdad). (No. 22.) Sir, Foreign Office, March 11, 1941. IN his telegram No. 660 of the 7th November last Sir Basil Newton referred to the possibility of financial and economic' assistance for Iraq and enumerated the points on which it seemed to him most important that the Iraqi Government should in return take action to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. 2. The position as regards financial assistance is that His Majesty’s Government would in principle be prepared to agree to a direct subsidy to the Iraqi Government. The most convenient basis for such a subsidy seems to be the payment of a sum sufficient to make up the decrease in the oil royalties due in present circumstances from the Iraq Petroleum Company. I understand that, although the figure involved cannot yet be accurately forecast, it would amount to between £500,000 and £800.000 per annum. Payment would be made in i monthly instalments, so that the subsidy could at once be stopped if the Iraqi Government failed to fulfil their undertakings. The subsidy would be in sterling and would only be available for expenditure in the sterling area. 3. Out of this sum the Iraqi Government would be required to repay to His Majesty’s Government, in monthly instalments of £15,000 free of interest, their outstanding debt of some £300,000 for the Hinaidi buildings. 4. If such a subsidy is paid. His Majesty’s Government would expect the i Iraqi Government to reappoint a British financial adviser. The deterioration of their finances since the termination of the former adviser’s contract should convince them that such an appointment would be in their own interest. It is, of course, in the interest of His Majesty’s Government, in order to prevent misuse of the subsidy, e.g., by maintaining agitators from Palestine. 5. As soon as the Iraqi Government’s attitude again becomes satisfactory His Majesty’s Government will be prepared, if necessary, to provide dollars for the commercial needs of Iraq to an annual amount of £150,000. It is. however, at present impossible for His Majesty s Government to provide dollars for military expenditure in the United States of America, since they have informed the United States Government that they no longer have any dollars to meet their own military expenditure in the United States of America and are on this ground obtaining assistance from the United States Government. The question whether some arrangement could be made with the United States Government by which war material could be supplied to Iraq could be considered when circumstances appear to warrant it, but in any case it is not certain that it is in the interests of His Majesty’s Government to provide assistance in this matter, especially in view of the doubts they feel as to the use to which such material might be put on its arrival in Iraq. 6. As a condition of providing the Iraqi Government with foreign exchange. His M^ajesty’s Government would also require them to establish a satisfactory system of'exchange control on the lines already suggested to them. This is important from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, since money can be transferred to Iraq freely from the rest of the sterling area, including this country, and there is therefore a grave risk that leakage might take place on a very large scale. It is also in the interest of Iraqi Government, since dollars can only be supplied to them in strictly limited quantities, and it is onlv by establishing effective exchange control that they can ensure that the best possible use is made of the dollars they earn themselves. 7 If His Majestv’s Government are to pay a direct subsidy to the Iraqi Government other types of economic assistance may be unnecessary. They would in any case’be more difficult to arrange in practice. As regards barley, for instance the Iraqi Government cannot really need any assistance to dispose of their surplus crops since the demand for barley in the Middle East, and [15—31] 'enclosure IN WEEiTiT letter 1 3 ’ 2 9 1941 from secretary, political and SECRET DEPT. INDIA 0FF£E__2 *r~ particularly the requirements of Greece, make it likely that the Iraqi crop wi be disposed of at a very favourable price. The Greek Government have, however, been requested to authorise His Majesty’s Government to negotiate on their behalf, and I hope that it may be possible to make some political capital out ot the matter. , , , tt- at • 8. The Iraqi Government have, indeed, asked for the help of His Majesty ^ ^ Government over Zahdi dates, but these are of such poor quality as not to U worth shipping space. Any purchase of them would merely be for destruction and, I think, that if payment has to be made to relieve distress among Iraqi producers, it had better be made by the Iraqi Government. 9. I shall, of course, be grateful to receive any suggestions that your Excellency may wish to make for using to better political advantage the money which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to spend. I should mention in this connexion the possibility that His Majesty’s Government may, for strategic reasons, wish improvements of various kinds to be effected in the Iraqi railway system. In present circumstances such improvements could hardly be made except at the expense of His Majesty’s Government. 10. Of the requirements of His Majesty’s Government m Iraq by far the most urgent is to secure the formation of a new Government prepared to co-operate with them in the spirit of the alliance. I attach importance also to rupture of relations with Italy, if only because this step would make it clear m Iraq and elsewhere that the Iraqi Government have at last decided, despite the intrigues of the Axis and the German declaration to the Arabs, to stand by theii obligations towards His Majesty’s Government. I also attach great importance to action being taken to stop'the Mufti’s intrigues. It may be difficult even for a well-disposed Government to take really effective action against him. but even so it should be possible to exercise some measure of control over him, and to put an end to the present system, under which he abuses Iraqi hospitality in acting practically openly as an enemy agent. -t at 11. Three additional points were mentioned in Sir Basil Newton s telegram under reference. 12. Point 2 : Propaganda .—An improvement m the tone of press and wireless broadcasts would no doubt follow the entry into power of a more friendly Government, but I agree that His Majesty’s Government would certainly have to see that very definite improvements did in fact take place and were maintained. . , ^ u 13. Point 4 : Education.—I agree that the appointment ot a Britisn adviser in the Ministry of Education would be useful, and you may well wish to pursue this suggestion if a favourable opportunity occurs. Presumably the post would carry no executive powers, but even so the right man might be able to influence the Ministry’s policy in many directions, and could also co-operate effectively with the British Council. 14. ' Point 5 : Economic Warfare .—As regards economic warfare, impor tance is attached to closer Iraqi collaboration in checking re-exports to doubtful destinations, and the smuggling of goods to Syria so long as the policy or economic pressure on Syria is maintained; also in controlling goods in transit, whether destined for, or originating in, countries to which their equivalent to Trading with the Enemy Act has been made to apply. In this connexion I would invite your attention to my telegram No. 96, A rfar, of,,the__22lldM)ecember last regarding German exports to Iran. I realise that the prohibition of this trade may cause difficulties between the Governments of Iraq and Iran, but it is a step which His Majesty’s Government are clearly entitled under article 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance to require that the Iraqi Government shall take, and is one to which they attach importance I am, &amp;c.

On the other hand I hear on fairly good authority that General Taha recently broached with clique the question of a temporary transfer from Bagdad area and met with a rebuff. 5. I much hope that Secretary of State will think fit to urge very strongly that if stability in Iraq is to be maintained, Government must govern and make it impossible for military officers to influence policy. His Majesty’s Government are directly concerned firstly on account of their interest in stability of Iraq and its line of communication and secondly because political influence so V improperly exercised by these officers is anti British. 'During recent crisis these officers in their support of Rashid Ali dared to intimidate the Regent and threaten his family and in order to avoid further exposure to this pressure Regent withdrew a few days later to Diwaniya* 4. General Taha seeks to belittle their activities and to put the blame on Rashid Ali for using them as tools but I have little doubt that in his heart he vrould like to be able to use them for his own purpose again in future as he has done in the past. Taufiq Sawaidi who is believed to dislike political influence of these officers will therefore have difficulty in pushing Taha into [2 groups undec,J out would be at present strongly supported by the Regent and less strongly by nearly all the political leaders [? group omitted] Rashid Ali.

I trust therefore that you will approve my action in substituting for words after n Ally n down to word ^’disposal'' the following:* 'and in view of that provision and of *grp.undec.]* obligation to furnish all possible facilities and assistance on Iraqi territory'. Minister for Foreign Affairs remarked to me this morning that he had been examining the treaty and had drawn the Prime Minister's attention to this particular provision as well as to obligation to give aid in capacity of an ally. 3 . I would draw attention to another point of the treaty interpretation. Under Article No.5 Annexure, His Majesty's Government are bound to supply military equipment. General Naterhouse and I have therefore refrained from saying such equipment will not be supplied but explained that until Iraqi Government meet our requirements, no priority can be given to such supplies.

Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs dined with.me last night when I again spoke very plainly about the recent political activities of certain officers and the necessity for breaking off relations with Italy. The two questions are interconnected and when public opinion is invoked as an argument against the latter, it is influential military clique which is chiefly meant. 2. There may still be some dangerous trouble from these officers as General Taha admitted after trying'to suggest there was nothing of importance to complain of m their activities 9 As regards both questions, he made his usual plea for patience. He was^discqmfited when I pinned on to him his responsibilities as Prime Minister, pointing out that new Government seemed to have as favourable an opportunity as could be expected for remedying mistakes of their predecessors, and said I had not as yet heard of anything effective being done to prevent a general resumption by a few officers of political activities v/hich had recently threatened the stability of the State and prejudiced good relations of Iraq with her Ally. As regards the rupture with Italy, I observed that I had been instructed to press for this very strongly and that I was going to speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs officially on the subject the following morning. 3. The Prime Minister subsequently discussed my remarks with the Minister for Foreign affairs who sent for *&amp;r©^r L s secretary early this morning to explain, before my official interview took place, that the Government thought it necessary to overcome certain difficulties in Parliament and in the Army before they could break off relations with Italy. At this interview I sppke in the rense of your telegram and repeated the points I had made last night. I suggested that in Parliament and elsewhere new Government should not merely defend themselves but take the line that they were there to retrieve great blunders of Rashid Ali andcompany. I urged.too that one better guidance recently given to public opinion by new Prime Minister had been negative and insufficient and should be replaced by positive explanations that ic was the duty and clearly the interest of Iraq to collaborate with ooeOOOOOA 2 . with her Ally. I hinted that Iraq had to choose in essence between her relations with a despised and anti-Arab Italy and the friendship of her well-tried British Ally. 4. Taufiq Suwaidi has I think, a good deal of sympathy with such^representations but he will have difficulty in pushing Taha who is playing for time and is by temperament irresolute. I doubt whether we can hope for much more with Taufiq than to make him feel so uncomfortable that he will expedite his resigntation. That may precipitate another crisis but if so it should prove much shorter and less acute than the last e Repeated to Cairo telegram No: 44, Angora telegram No: 52, Delhi telegram No: 29, Jerusalem telegram No: 26, Jedda telegram No: 19.1ND’ .At.

Prime Pinister seems to hope that we will make concessions of various kinds without any specific advance being made on Iraqi side. I think therefore that you # should speak to him or to the kinister for Foreign Affairs on the following lines. In view of attitude of previous Prime kinister Iraoi application for supply.of small arms ammunition factory ''requirements and ammunition itseli had simply been shelved, like Iraqi request for dollars. Now we are ouite prepared to go into question sympathetically&gt; and (subieef to certain stipulations regarding exchange control which we considei to beininterest of Iraq as much as ol ourselves) we could let Iraqi Government have reasonable amounts of dollars for military and civilian r , e( iuirements. We could also supply Audax aircraft. We are already spending large sums on Bagdad-Haifa road, and there is possibility that we may be prepared to expand Iraqi railway system also at our own expense. 4 . All this, however, requires sacrifice (in our part qnrh as we feel would only be justified if Iraqi Government woSd meet one of our definite requirements by breaking off . diplomatic relations with Italy. Yo “ ag t nress for this sten very strongly. The Angloplraqi . Treaty says that in the event of one party being involved in hostilities the other party will at gYnature assistance i n the capaci ty of ap »_Uy, and although nature of the assistance To^e afforded by' Iraq is defined as Pitting her communications etc. at our disposal, we do not see how Iraqi Government can possibly maintain that they are fulfilling their obligations unless they at least breaK off diplomatic relations with any country witn which we are at war. 5 RECd.

We understand that late Prime I'inister worked up good deal of-feeling against severance of relations with Italy on ground that this would involve Iraq in the war. His Majesty's Government desire that as little as Iraqi Government, hut if rupture with Germany did not involve Iraq in war it is difficult to see why rupture with Italy should do so. In any case Iraqi Government must he prepared to take some risks in return for benefits of the alliance, and we cannot hut feel-that in view of our present successes against Italy Iracii Government should he able to persuade country that rupture wit}i Italy is not unduly dangerous.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs represented that the only hindrance to satisfactory relations with Great Britain was the Palestine question, maintained that Irag. had faithfully fulfilled her treaty obligations and complained of British action in withholding dollars for the purchase of war material in the United States. Colonel Donovan said that America was determined that Great Britain should win the war and- would make arms available only to Great Britain and those countries genuinely supporting her. Only such countries could expect^United States sympathy at the Peace Conference: and American opinion would not consider Iraq justified in making the fulfilment of her obligations contingent on British policy in Palestine. The Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed impressed and_recommended Colonel Donovan to repeat these views to ihe Prime Minister. 4o With the Prime Minister Colonel Donovan accordingly .took the initiative. General Taha seemed surprised and even I annoyed at the United States attitude but he was impressed. He ! also complained of our refusal to provide dollars for war material, to which Colonel Donovan replied that as soon as Iraq established relations with Great Britain which were satisfactory to the latter, the United States, upon a British request, would be willing to aid Iraq. 5.

I pointed out that of the three main questions dealt with in the White Paper effective action had already been taken in regard to immigration and land transfers. So far as I knew it was not considered possible to proceed further in war-time with the Third. The Prime Minister remarked that according to the Jewish Agency, immigration figures were very large. I gave him the latest official figures showing a total of 2o,835 up to the end of September 1940 for legal and illegal immigrants and emphasised the fact that no quota had been assigned for the period from October 1940 to March 1941. The Prime Minister also made a vague reference to the possibility of an eventual Arab Federation or Confederation. I observed that Great Britain, the only great Power which had consistently [befriended] and helped the Arabs, had no desire to discourage such a possibility, but considered that the initiative must come from the Arabs themselves.

U.s-i&gt;L,. / Bagdad, December 30, 1940. WITH reference to my telegrams Nos 801 and 803 o f the 24th Hecember, I Sir B. Newton (No. 589.) Sir, have the honour to transmit to you herewith a full translation of the official text published in the press of the statement on foreign policy which the Prime Minister made to the Finance Committee of the Chamber on the 21st December. 2. As I have already reported, it contains a number of ambiguous phrases which can at will be interpreted to satisfy many different shades of opinion. For example, the first of the Prime Minister’s three principles of policy is so worded that it could, at his convenience, be held to mean either that he would continue to secure the protection of Iraq through the alliance with Great Britain or that he was firmly determined not to allow the alliance to be used to embroil Iraq with Britain’s enemies. 3. The second principle embraces “ Iraq’s national mission,” but does not define it. The press, in commenting, have, however, generally assumed that this mission is to strive for the realisation of Arab national aspirations concerning Palestine and Syria. 4. The Prime Minister’s third principle of foreign policy has the outward appearance of a full and frank acceptance of the letter and spirit of the Anglo- Iraqi Alliance, but it is evidently qualified by the equally emphatic statement that “as an independent State Iraq should in all her proceedings seek her national interest and the realisation of her national aspirations and avoid being carried away on a course inconsistent with these interests and aspnations. Similarly, the phrase (which is especially vague and difficult to translate in the original) ‘ ‘ but there is no doubt that we are required to exercise much care and steadiness to bring all of these (the three principles) into harmony, and we must not be influenced bv propaganda of any kind ” arouses the suspicion that the third principle would in some measure be surrendered if it was found to be coming into conflict with the first or second. 5 It will be noticed that immediately after speaking of Angio-Iraqi relations the Prime Minister referred to the strengthening of good relations with other friendly States. This is another statement that is not above suspicion, and I fear that it implies the Prime Minister’s determination to seek good relations with all States prepared to be friendly with Iraq, regardless of the condition o their relations with Great Britain. My Turkish colleague expressed the personal opinion that it might be definitely intended as a kind of reassurance to Germany g k Deputy who was present at the discussion relates that after the Pi ime Minister’s statement a member asked whether there was any truth in the stories that were current to the effect that the British Government had demanded that they should be allowed to enlist Iraqis in the British army and that Iraqi troops should be sent to fight with the Allied forces. The Prime Minister replied that all such stories were quite baseless. Another member then asked why in these circumstances a crisis had developed between the Iraqi and British Governments. The Prime Minister replied that there was no crisis, but there were certain differences about which he was unable to give details, as they were still under discussion. agked whether th@ of he Minister for Foreign Affairs was due to the fact that he disagreed with the policy of the Cabinet I he Prime Minister said that there were no differences among the members of Cabinet, and added that it was the custom for a minister either to accept the vipwc: of the maionty of the Cabinet oi to iesign. , i • 8 I have not been told what the Prime Minister hoped to achieve by his statement but to iudge from the contents, it was just part of his general policy ff' to keep i footing in half a. dozen different camps at ot^ Njither the Regent nor the Minister for IVeeffefo.fJlMniWEEKLY U [1M9] ' „o. -« Copy No. 95 ‘“Tl ,c T ;^v, POUTiCAL AND2 although ten days previously General Nuri had seemed to attach importance to the publication of a declaration by the Prime Minister. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to His Majesty s representatives at Cairo and Jedda. I have, &amp;c. BASIL NEWTON. Enclosure. Translation of Statement made by the Prime Minister on December 2\ to the Finance Committee of the Chamber on the occasion of a discussion on the vote for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. THE world is going through critical circumstances and being swept by a violent storm such as is calculated to shake and undermine the powers of even the most strongly-established nations. In the circumstances the task confronting small nations, particularly the young ones, must no doubt be most difficult. Accordingly, the management of the affairs of such nations in such troubled world conditions calls for the greatest measure of wisdom and loyalty on the part ot those in places of responsibility, and for the closest co-operation and solidarity among the people, for without such co-operation the ship of btate cannot reach the haven of safety. . The bases on which our foreign policy stands and by which we are guided in seeking to steer a sound course in the present terrible world conditions are three in number : — Firstly. —To ensure the safety of the country and not to involve the country in any action calculated to drag it into the war; to exert the utmost efforts to ensure the continuance of the tranquillity which the country has been enjoying notwithstanding the frightful world struggle, in order that the members of the nation should be able to continue their normal activities to their own interest and the interest of the whole nation and to conserve all their energies for the service of their country and for the defence of their national existence should compelling need arise. Secondly—To continue the discharge of the national mission which Iraq has taken upon herself to carry out, especially as Iraq is one of the Arab States enjoying the boon of independence and is in a position to voice the national aspirations and seek their realisation. Thirdly .—To discharge our international undertakings, such as the Arab Alliance and Pact of Non-Aggression, which unites us to our neighbours. As regards our relations with our Ally, Great Britain, these are, as }ou know, based on the Treaty of Alliance concluded between us. We have adhered, and shall continue to adhere, to the fulfilment of this treaty, both in the letter and the spirit, striving continuously for the strengthening of the links of friendship between us on a reciprocal basis. Similarly, our friendly relations are being strengthened with States in amity with us. I and my colleagues have undertaken upon ourselves, in truth and sincerity, to proceed in the light of these three principles, but there is no doubt that we are required to exercise much care and steadiness to bring them all into harmony and we must not be influenced by propaganda of any kind, especially as in their present struggle the various nations are each attempting to enlist in its own service all toe forces of the world. Having regard to the important position it occupies, Iraq is the first country to which attention will be turned in this connexion. So our principal duty is to find the correct course for us to follow in this troubled sea in order to lead the nation to safety while realising its high aims. I must, however, make it plain that, as an independent State, Iraq should, in all her proceedings, seek her national interest and the realisation of her national aspirations and avoid being carried away towards a course inconsistent with these interests and aspirations. , , , . , , , , , , v I wish to seize the occasion to thank the various leaders and members of the nation who have supported the Government and acted loyally to their country.

Iraq had I not been called on by her Ally Great Britain to .do anything l likely to involve her in war. Iraq had been discharging her treaty obligations towards Great Britain and Government were determined to strengthen relations of friendship with Great Britain on the basis of the alliance and the exchange of mutual benefits.

As regards rupture with Italy, he proposed to examine how far this could be considered to be a treaty obligation and at the same time to investigate and control thp activities of the Legation. He said he would also advocate preparation of public opinion for eventual rupture but he hintecl that this step would depend &lt;?n the. continuance of British military successes m Africa. 3. ?

IMPORTANT. 5th February, 1911 1C hhh Your telegram No. 93. 1 spoke to General Taha yesterday on lines indicated in .paragraphs.^ and 3. 2 In congratulating him on assumption of office I said that I look forward to a complete change of atmosphere and to restoration.of traditional relations of close friendship ana collaboration to the mutual advantage of^our two countries. Nev/ Government would, oi course, be iudged by its actions*and there were a number ol specific difficulties which would, I trusted now be removed* For gkample at the beginning a11 recent difficulties had been the failure of the Iraqi Government to break off dl P lom 2 tlG + re ?:?^ with Italy last summer and consequent ret_nt^on of Italian Legation in Bagdad. I warned him that so long as the Legation remained it would continue to poison the atmosphere. I mentioned that there wouia he many other specific matters such as guidance givei to public opinion which I would wish to discuss ..im the new Government but I would not enter into y further details at this interview. 3 . Taha said he could not regard rupture with Tt'iiv as treatv obligation for Iraqi Government .and ftrl 7 undec ] that It was not in Iraq’s interests to igg'tiSs stop. It might later on ejPo« Im to dan er of attack by air. He assured me at the same time that his Government had no intention ° strictly 8 diplomatic relations with Geimany and would strictly , circuuscribe activities of Italian Legation. REC*. POL. DEPt 1 \FEB u4l' 2 . ' ^ l. I replied that I feared you would be very disappointed if he were unable to go further. As regards the latter assurances, although of course I accepted them at their full value, it would no doubt be remembered in London that similar, assurances given by his predecessor had been in effective. 5. Taha then mentioned some points concerning which he thought Iraq had been badly treated by His Majesty's Government. He spoke of your talk with Iraqi Chargd d'Affaires on January 9th (your telegram No. 3L) and said that after having carried out every request for aid made by Great Britain.under treaty alliance, it was discouraging to find that Secretary of State classified Iraq amongst Britain*s unfaithful friends. He referred to the generous help given to Turkey and Greece and argued that although Iraq was not perhaps so near to the conflict as these two countries, His Majesty's Government should be willing to give her at least ten per cent of help afforded to Turkey. In reply to my comments, he admitted that help to Turkey was help for defence of Iraq but said that Iraq would like to have the means to defend herself too. There was much equipment which Iraq Army needed but which could not be purchased because His Majesty's Government.would not provide the necessary dollars. Half a million pounds worth was required for their plans of military purchases in the years 19 L 0 - 19 L 1 and the new year - 19L2, This included raw materials for Bagdad small arms ammunition factory which could only carry on for two months more with available stocks. He.also spoke about small arms ammunition, purchase of which has been arranged from India under export credits scheme, but only three million rounds had been delivered. He begged for further deliveries. 6 . I promised to report his request and said that in the meantime I would, if he wished, recommend to you that a special effort should be made to supply 15 Audax aircraft (your telegram No. 80) for which Ministry of Defence had been asking. He was grateful for this offer but pressed again the need for dollars.7 Although Taha gave so little concrete evidence of his intention to meet our requirements and I fear that maintenance of strong pressure wil be necessary, I think it would be worth while 0 make some snail gesture which &gt; with °p t + P a gv“ g t hat too much hargaining power, will serve to show that it will not he for lack of good-will on oar part if the present Government is not [grp 0 undec.j put our relations on a satisfactory footing. Rupture with Italy will no doubt remain difficult to achieve. ./hen I last saw the Regen mentioned to him importance we attached to this ^ten being taken by the new Government. tfhiie i am sure His Royal Highness would welcome -rupture he gave me the impression of hoping that we would not press this issue too strongly at first. 8 In all circumstances I suggest therefore that in addition to shipment of 15 Audax aircraft w should try to supply further instalments of smal ( arras ammunition from G^^nfferell though here instalment of dollars might also ^ offered though nere t am inclined to think that it would he better to hold such an offer in reserve until the Taha Governm n , •with whom we shall probably have to bargain for al concessions made, shows its hand more clearly.

Failure to secure rupture of relations with Italy last June has been cause of many of our difficulties. Our increased strength in Middle East and resignation of Rashid All should present a second opportunity. There will no doubt be much opposition to this step but I do not see what better chance is likely to occur. You should continue to make it clear that all intrigues with Axis Powers and Japan must cease and to suggest that if Iraqi Government want to regain full confidence and support of His Majesty's Government no step could be more effective than rupture of diplomatic relations with Italy. 5. At the same time in order to counter enemy propaganda you will no doubt stress that recent quarrel has nox been of our choosing and that it is our sincere desire to return to friendly collaboration which has been of such advantage to Iraq in the past and is her only sensible policy now.

I had no doubt that Your Highness was desirous of removing all impediments obstructing the way of loyal persons but foreign influences and foreign interests which do not desire that' mutual confidence should prevail between Your Highness and a Government resolved loyally and honestly to continue to serve the country prevailed upon Your Highness to show dissatisfaction with my Cabinet. This was revealed by Your Highness refraining from attendance at the royal court and keeping to Your Highness’s private palace thereby affecting the free conduct of their work by the Cabinet. Your Highness's feeling of dissatisfaction^persisted as . was evinced by your leaving the capital of the Kingdom and holding up Iradahs submitted to Your Highness, in particular the Iradah for the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies. The Cabinet who assumed responsibility for the affairs and administration of the country in these critical circumstances foitnd it necessary to consult the electorate about their policy with a view to ensuring closer co-operation between the . legislature and the executive, such closer co-operation being called for by present world conditions.

Parliament gave clear evidence of its dissatisfaction and he was threatened with a vote of no confidence yesterday morning. Thereupon followed an attempt to dissolve Parliament. In above circumstances it is clear that Prime Minister s resignation is, in fact, the result of internal dissatisfaction with his administration. It seems undesirable to broadcast full text of letter or quote references to the Regent's absence from the palace anh withdrawal from Bagdad. For vour information and guidance.

No. 45. 999999999 My immediately preceding telegram. Ihn Saud has sent me a copy of Rashid Ali’s voluminous reply to his letter (my telegram No. 0315). Following is summary: Rashid Ali appreciates Ihn Saud’s advice. He is surprised at His Majesty's Government's belief that he is working against them as since he came to power, he has executed all provisions of the treaty regarding building of roads and railways, passage of troops and safeguarding of vital points. It is true he has not severed relations with Italy but the treaty does not oblige him to do so, and he must avoid action which might involve Iraq in war. If His Majesty's Government are displeased with him on this count, why not with Turkey who not only has not severed relations with Brit ain’s enemies but still concludes commercial treaties with them. If His Majesty's Government deduee that his policy is hostile to them, because Germany has resumed diplomatic relations [ grp, omtd] that is a delusion (sic). If they judge his policy from Iraq press and wish to make him responsible for every written word, demand is exaggerated but he is willing to accede to it on condition that Iraq National feeling is not affected. He is careful to give no opening for propaganda prejudicial to essential interests of Iraq's ally Britain. He attributed His Majesty's Government's erroneous belief, that his policy is anti-British to the following: (1) The frankness of his language when discussing with His Majesty's Ambassador British policy in Arab countries. (2) Persons who, ignorant of the true situation in Iraq, have created atmosphere (?). (3) Scheming of intriguers whose only occupation is spreading ill feeling and embarrassing British [?friendship]. Why should he believe enemy broadcasts when he can listen to his ally's broadcast and has Britain’s written promise of grant of Independence to Palestine? How could there be any agreement between/between him and the Axis Powers directed against Britain or how could such an agreement be implemented? Such is foolish-*''' talk. He is not working against His Majesty's Government. He confirms his statement to Foreign Affairs Committee that Iraq will adhere to the spirit and letter of the Treaty. British complained that there is general ill feeling against them in Iraq. This feeling is common to all Arabs owing to their policy in Palestine and cannot be checked by any Arab statesman. Rashid Ali concludes by stating that British without any right or justification are exerting economic and financial pressure on his Government.

Ibn Baud is sending short replv expressing satis faction at Rashid All’s assurance that his policy is not directed against Britain.

He must remove every obstacle in the way of attainment of harmony on v/hich general Arab welfare depends whatever difficulties he may encounter in doing so.. Sooner or later the Arabs can hope to solve with the British all their difficulties. To turn to others would be to bring positive havoc and destruction to *rabs in this World and the next. 2.

IMPORTANT zzzzzzzz A My telegram NOA5, After a week of shilly-shallying, accompanied hy some tension and innumerable rumours, the Regent decided yesterday, to bring the matter to a head, by threatening to abdicate unless the Government resigned. He seems confident this evening that his threat has succeeded .and considers that although the Prime Minister has not yet himself resigned his Government can no longer be. recognised as effective. Four resignations exist in writing, namely those of Nuri, Naji SNaukat, Omar Nazmi and Sadiq Bassam which bring the rest of the Government below the constitutional number. In addition, the Regent understands definitely that Taha has resigned, as I have also heard from other sources. The Regent's present idea is to form a government with the President of the Senate Muhammad As Sadr as Prime Minister and to include Jamil Madfai. Taha would also be in the new Government, but not at the Ministry of l Defence for which the Regent has in mind the present Chief of the General Staff or Ismael Namiq.* It is not yet clear however that the crisis is over and the officer in command of the First Division has given orders, . presumably on his own authority, for the First Division which ^ is stationed in and near Bagdad to stand by. The Regent told me that in addition to the Chief of the General Staff, he can count on the loyalty of the Divisional Commanders in the South and North of Iraq. In any case he feels that military demonstrations in Bagdad can only a demonstrate their own illegality and futility. His threat to i Uresign was moreover, he assured me, a safe bluff as the * 1 \ country would never agree to his replacement, f Repeated to Cairo telegram No.l5» (Please repeat to Jedda telegram No. 6 ) Government of India telegram No.10, Angora telegram No e 26, Jerusalem telegram No.A, Tehran telegram No.o Saving.DISTRIBUTION B. /»&gt; lOfa ^ FROM IRAQ .

Egyptian Prime Minister added that in conversation with Egyptian representative at Bagdad, Iraqi Prime Minister had asserted that the last thing he ^isheo. was to be against England, but that he could not help being upset about the attitude of Great Britain towards Palestine. He agreed with the White Paper but saw r, reaSSh for delay in its execution. He feared that after the war, in which he hoped and was sure that England would be victorious, America,who would have afforded, ner great help in achieving victory and was pressed by Jews, would influence England against the Arabs He wanted England to understand that m Arabic nations she would find better friends than elsewhere and that it was to her interest to appease the Arabs over this question with a view to strengthening their collaboration during the rest of the war. 3 .

They both knew the danger that confronted them if the Axis were victorious against thfc# common ally.

On instructions from his Government, the Turkish Minister made a verbal communication to the_Minister for foreign Affairs on December 28th in the following sense. 2. The Turkish Government had been happy to learn from the Iraqi Charge d'Affaires as a result of enquiries he had made, that information received from, ./ashington was not well founded. As an allv of Great Britain and a member of the Saadabad pact, the Turkish Government were particularly glad that Anglo-Iraqi relations should develop satisfactorily on a basis of friendly co-operation. 5. The communication sounded to me somewhat colourless ? and to accept Iraqi professions at their face value. My Turkish colleague told me however, that on receiving it,.Nun Pasha had remarked that this helped his task. . There is no doubt that enquiry previously made by the Turkish Government of the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires at Angora produced a considerable impression here. 4. Earlier on the same morning of December 28th. Nuri Pasha had called on me for further long discussion ^nd had told me that Taha, while agreeing to the necessity for change of Government, wished for more time m which to make it. ° I had renlied to Nuri Pasha, that, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, delay in remedying serious situation to which attention of the Iraqi Government had been drawn was already excessive. 5.

I agree that in the present circumstances t '‘coup de main'against the Regent is not likely but it is not impossible, so I feel it desirable to be prepared, at least to the extent of ccrsuiting you in advance, as far as possible. I cannot forecast what form the coup would take if attempted, nor suggest therefore, what counter measures on our part, if any, might be practicable. One possibility however, which I have had in mind is that a small body of men (possibly soldiers) might on some pretext secure the control of the Regent s person and keep him shut from outside contacts in.his own palace. In that event prompt action by the Air Officer CoiManding. (including the use of force 3 Ll in our judgment this was expedient) might disnerse the gang and lead xo their being officially disavov;ed. whereas the delay for reference to you might allow the movement to gather impetus and become a serious menace. The real danger mipiit lie not so much in probable strength of the blow but m the inertia or complicity of those whose duty it would be to deal with it. It was for these reasons that I asked you to authorise the Air Officer Commanding and myself at our discretion to take immediately such limited action as might be practicable to safeguard or rescue the person of the Regent by the use of the Royal Air Force resources, without our being obliged to lose the time required for prior reference to yourself. Existing instructions governing local Royal Air Force intervention relate to ouite different circumstances.

As regards paragraph 2 of your telegram I assume that it would be mv duty at any time to help the Regent to escape if he were forced to flee from the country but the whole purpose of my encuiry was that the Air Officer Commanding and I should be prepared to seize any opportunity that might be open to us to qave him from being faced with tnis necessity. I need hardly Ity that in all probability the flight of the Regent even tothe Roval Air Force station at Habbaniya would be fatally damaging xo his position in this country. I ^ lso .r ea ^ S t}lt hnuld a couo intprvention of anv kind might weaken it, so that should a coup OOcS it woSld be far better for him to overcome it unaided if he can.

It was Taufiq Suwaidi who let out that the project of creating some kind of Privy Council or preferably Regency Council was again to the fore. He maintained that it was permissible under the constitution even now to change the Regent for a Regency Council. 2. I feel that only a strong predilection for such an idea could lead him to take this view. Article 22 of the constitution provides clearly that in the event of the throne passing to a minor, the King^s prerogatives shall be exercised by a Regent. Article 23 mentions a Regency Council as an alternative to a Regent only during the King’s absence from the country. Moreover it seems to be out of the question that a Regent once appointed should be replaced by a Regencv Council. 3. It will be recalled that Yasin al Hashimi was one of the originators of the idea of a Council to advise the King and that Taufiq Suwaidi took it up with vigour in the autumn of 1937 4. The purpose young King G-hazi ( e then was to check irresponsible impulses 508 and 510 of I Xl-i. V^HJ.GC4J-L \ J-/ClvA o L/O. U 0 X 1 • Vl.y Li, C XliVA C/JLv/ _ L/X ,3ifl/3£ December 1937). Now it seems to be to control what in certain / quarters is regarded as unnecessary pro-British oolicy of the Regent. 5. From a constitutional point of view a Privy Council would, I think, soon prove to be unworkable because its members would either be [gr.undec.] or interfere in affairs in a manner that would be intolerable to any Cabinet. Regency Council besides being undesirable on account of reason for which it is being advocated, would certainly be equally unworkable. 6.

I entirely approve of his refusal to leave Bagdad and hope that you will be able to persuade him to stand up boldly to Prime Minister. 2o In last resort and if he is convinced that his life is endangered, you may certainly take such steps as seem feasible to Air Officer Commanding and yourself to secure his escape.

Prime Minister has also now made declaration repprted in my telegram No. 801. In various (?way]s declaration is ambiguous, but conceivably Tb can be used to facilitate the departure of Prime Minister which, as I have pointed out, remains as urgently necessary as ' ,; L?everJ^' in the interests of Anglo-Iraqi relations. 2. In reoly to the message of advice to Prime Minister to resign Rashid Ali accompanied by Taha and Naji Suwaidi called to inform Regent of their decision to remain in office and Taha hinted that message had not been constitutional, 5. Today I discussed means of resolving this deadlock with Regent and with Nuri Pasha: who seemed to be rather at a loss. I did not encourage recourse to Parliamentary mediation. ^ (All Jaudat also has informed me of his, belief that a vote of no. confidence could be obtained after due preparation). I pointed out to the Regent that Parliament was -very- subject to undue influence of Government in power and that failure.to secure majority would make matters worse. I suggested in the first place, at any rate, more direct methods, and as upshot oi a long discussion, the plan evolved which they seemed to favour was the following. .n 0 Senate Minister for Foreign Affairs as well as an ex-Prime Minister. He should obtain from them written expression of opinion in iayour 01 change of government. Regent should then confront Prime Minister with this advice making **L?it]- clear that he was doing.so in accordance with the Cabinet’s own wish and.expressing, ii ^his were constitutional, his concurrence in this advice. It was realised that Prime Minister would probably still.decline to resign but his position would have weakened and Regent might und it easier to persuade some of *minor- members of Cabinet suchas Raouf Bahrani and Sidiq Bassam to resign with Nun Pasha. Meanwhile Regent would do whatever he properly could to embarrass the present Cabinet. . ^ ^5. alternative-* which I did not much favour* was to try to draw Naji Suwaidi away from Rashid Ali by offering succession to office of Prime Minister to him. My own preference as I indicated would be for as clean a sweep as possible though there should be no objection nor great difficulty in including '•-minor-• members of the present government in new Cabinet under Madfai. Nuri Pasha’s own inclusion would I fear be difficult* But his present colleagues are equally unwilling to do anything which would be to Nuri Pasha’s personal advantage. 6. In course of audience I made it very plain that Kis Majesty’s Government considered course consistently followed by Prime Minister to be anti-British and would eventually consider those who continued more or less to support Rashid .to be ^also anti-British. It was quite obvious that infant State ox Iraq had only one reliable friend and unless there were change oi Prime Minister, Iraq would lose this one friend. I suggested that if fog of mis-statements now being spread by Prime Minister could be sufficiently dispersed it was inconceivable that^ patriotic and responsible Iraqis could wish to sacrifice interests of their country m order to keep such a man in power. 7. I made it clear that economic facilities and assistance would be increasingly withheld and I would recommend that such further twists as are possible should continue to be given ^to'*' economic screw. When advocating navicert system I do not mean that its mere introduction was a means of pressure; I had understood that it provided machinery required to enable strong pressure to be applied with discrimination.'

(Begins) I saw Lord Halifax to-day, Friday, and explaxned to him the contents of your telegram in its various aspects. He replied that the object of the British Government was friendship and good relations and non-interference m the. internal affairs of Iraq, but they had recently observed in Iraq matters inconsistent with the spirit of the Treaty o Alliance and indeed with its latter also and therefore the Ambassador had been instructed to make the statement he had made. I exolained to him the gravity of such a^statement and how it would harm the interests of both parties and benefit the third party. Similarly, I mentioned to him the unfortunate impression to which it would give rise in Iraqi and Arab circles in these critical days in addition.to its affect on racial pride and independence and to its inconsistency with the Treaty. He pondered a little and said I apprecia the gravity of the question; the fact that it does not af^ec only the two countries and that perhaps the enemy will pro i from it; but they were obliged so to act in view of the state of affairs they had recently observed, a state of which the least that could be said was that it far removed from co-operation expected between Allied States .

(1) that Rashid Ali had given it out that he had won over Jamil Madfai to join him in resisting attempt by His Majesty’s Government to turn out an Iraqi Prime Minister a d (2) that much wind has been taken out of the sails of Naji Shawkat and other defeatist or pro-Geman elements in Iraq by the Greek successes, by the failure of German diplomacy in the Balkans and by the denial by the Russian Ambassador (to Iraqi Minister at Angora) of the report that Russia and Gemany had agreed to divide Iran and Iraq between them and of other stories attributed by Russian Ambassador to German sources such as that Russia was helping Gemany to exercise pressure on Turkey.

Prime Minister sent Mr. Bdmonds to me this morning with text of telegram despatched to Iraqi Legation in London on November 27th. 2. Its description of the action which I have taken (details of which I have already reported) is fairly accurate in outline though not in detail. Telegram still confuses my formal communications to Minister for Foreign Affairs .and Regent with the story about proposals brought back by Naii Shawaat from Turkey (see my telegram No. 71M paragraph 3)•_ Moreover though I have certainly made it clear that the Prime Minister has lost the confidence of His Majesty 1 s Government I did not as is alleged draw the logical.conclusion.by offering to Iraqi Government two alternatives cited in Iraqi telegram of keeping either the Prime Minister or its good relations with Great Britain. 3. Iraqi Charge d 1 Affaires is instructed in this telegram to express surprise at communication which I have made and to enquire whether Secretar r of State confirms that I acted in accordance with instructions. At the same time he is to -point out that my action is regarded by Iraqi Government as not being in accord with mutual interests of the two Governments in these critical times.

No doubt with the intention that his observations should be passed on to me, the Prime Minister assured Mr. Edmunds this morning that his wish was to work in complete harmony with His Majesty's Government. His words also contained an underlying threat that per sistence by His Majesty’s Government in attempts to dislodge him would cause serious resentment ampng the public. There are many reports that Rashid Ali and %aii Shaukat* have declared that they will stick to office whatever happens. 2. Mr. Edmunds later saw Nuri Pasha who told him that he had sent in his resignation presumably on November 27th and sent copies to the Regent and to all of the members of the Cabinet. At the request of the Cabinet, Minister for Foreign &gt; Affairs had sent telegram on November 27th to Iraqi Legation in London with instructions described in my immediately following telegram. Nuri Pasha added that if the reply from London showed that Secretary of State lor Foreign Affairs confirmed his *[? action]* Umar Nadhmi and Taha would prpbably resign. 3. Latter may of course be v/ishful thinking but Nuri Pasha has no doubt been discussing with them formation of new Government. Many observers believe that Jamil Madfai is best able to form new Government. Difficulties in his way however are his^reluctance to include* Nuri Pasha and opposition of the military clique. ^ n _ nr7 Repeated to Cairo telegram No. 197.r-'v r 1 * ' y Jk. * -V„4 .&gt; ) » o CO DISTRIBUTION B !9 — s From: IRAQ Decypher: Sir B.

Using the opportunity given by the Regent s account of Taha’s proposal 'for dealing with the present political situation, I told,His Royal Highness that I ielt that no Cabinet would for long be satisfactory with Taha either as Prime Minister [? or] [? groups omitted: as Minister of J Defence. I recalled that Rashid All had himself attributed to Taha's influence the hostile attitude from cime to time adopted by the press, and said though Taha might oe less reckless than Rashid Ali, he seemed to me tohola similarly foolish and for Iraq dangerous views on foreign policy. At the same time I said that I quite realised tha1 ; 3 . ht inclusion in the next Cabinet as Minister of- Deience might be unavoidable.

This had seemed to me artificial and likely to have been inspired political/political reasons by Rashid Ali. I added that I had also heard that some Iraqi politicians had recently revived talk of creating a Regency or Privy Council. I explained that I thought that the first was unconstitutional and the second undesirable as prejudicial to prerogatives of the Crown, and impracticable as being certain to end in conflict between the Council and the Government or Regent. (I am submitting further observations on these ideas in a separate telegram), concluded by saying that though the above was the only inform ation I had of criticism of His Royal Highness*s action which might possibly be directed against his position.

First was for Naji Showkat, Naji Suwaidi and Nuri Pasha to resign and be replaced, in Suwaidi’s case, by his brother *Taufiq* presumably as Foreign Minister. Rashid Ali would remain P.M. Second proposal was that ( Naji Suwaidi should become P.M. *Taha* : had indicated his preference for the first alternative. The Regent had thought it wiser to refrain from making the obvious objection that it would not remove originating cause of the whole trouble so far as His Majesty's Government were concerned, because he did not wish to make the British attitude more of an issue than could be helped. After, therefore, taking time for reflection, he had intimated his own preference for the second alternative, pointing out that he could not work satisfactorily with Rashid Ali as P.M. The Regent had then sounded Naji Suwaidi who was thinking the matter over. first plan might be useful to eliminate Rashid All since there were already two vacancies in the Cabinet and if the three resignations now took place, the number remaining would be insufficient to form a constitutional Government. I pointed out that others had doubtless realisea this also, an that it might be dangerous to rely on tricky methods xor getting rid of a man who is himself a skilled and unscrupulous trickster, 4 Nuri Pasha, whose relations with ^Taha^have always been obscure, had told me something of the foregoing yesterday but he did not then reveal the leading part played by -‘iaha* nor in particular*Taha's*preforence for a plan which would leave Rashid Ali in power. Nuri Pasha remarked yesterday that if *Naii* Suwaidi formed a Government, it would only be transitional and that he himself might prefer to be oat of the country during the transition.

He is most grateful for His Majesty's Government’s message. He wishes to re-assert that his sole aim is furtherance of British and Arab interests. He himself has had to exercise great patience in his dealings with Iraq in order to avoid grave misunderstandingSo His policy in this respect has been largely dictated by his desire not to embarrass His Majesty’s Government. Small measure of agreement has been reached though propaganda against him still continues in Iraq. 3. Hie Majesty’s Government will thus understand what he has said about Iraq was not dictated by love of Iraq or of Rashid Ali but in our common interest. Ibn Saud believes Rashid Ali to have confidence and devotion of Iraqi people and army and that it would therefore be best to win him over to British side as alternative would create situation which Foreign propaganda would not be slow to exploit. 4. He has constantly advisee both Nuri Pasha and Rashid Ali to work with British. Former as is known misinterpreted his action and used his statement to lessen his, Ibn Saud s prestige in Arab eyes. Rashid Ali replied he would not work against His Majesty's Government and would carry out strictly terms of treaty but unfortunately his acts and mptives were misrepresented by his political opponents. He is now faced with choice of two evils; to go beyond terms of treaty in his co-operation with His Majesty's Government and incur hostility of Iraqi people and armv or to adhere strictly to terms of treaty and be thought by British to be adopting a hostile attitude. 5. Ibn Saud has made a final appeal to Rashid Ali in a letter which I summarise in my immediately following telegram. If His Majesty’s Government are determined not to trust Rashid AH Ibn Saud will let matter drop though he will always be ready to give Iraq such advice as he may feel to be useful. If noweyer His Majesty’s Government thinks cooperation with Rashid All is still possible he will exert himself to promption of full under standing. Understanding must be on the basis of mutual trust and it must hot appear to the Iraqi people that Rashid All is working in British interests to the detriment to those of Iraq. Rashid Ali must on his side exert himself to put a stop to all anti-British propaganda^ 6. Ibn Saud ends by expressing hone that His Majesty’s Government will give full consideration lohis views which he * expresses in conviction that he is acting in interests of His Majesty’s Government Iraq and Arab cause generally.

Following is summary of letter addressed hy Ibn‘ Saud to Atorid Ali. (1) M I recently took a step which I believe to be to the interest of Arabs and of Iraq. I communicated my views on Iraq to Kis Majesty’s Government. I have received their reply in which they make certain complaints about present situation which they regard as outcome of your activities. There are in my view three aspects from which relations between British and Arabs must be viewed: (1) Britain is our friend and the friend of Iraq. (2) The Arabs can expecr less evil and more good from British than from any others. (5) Control of all affairs -chat matter to the Arabs is in the hands of the British. (2)If above is admitted, it is the obvious duty of all Arabs to act in closest possible co-operation with Britain. I know from my experience of the British that they will make no intolerable demands on Arabs. Only question of which we not in full agreement with His Majesty’s Government is in the matter of Palestine but in judging His Majesty’s Government’s policy we must take the present circumstances into account and must remember that the majority of British people favour peace. Jewish ^nflienoe is great in America, of whose help Britain stands in need.. Once we are assured that no harm will befall the Arabs it is our duty to handle the Palestine question with that.tact and wisdom which it demands and by confidential discussions between ourselves and Britain reach agreement when time and circumstances permit. To achieve this end Arab countries just be governed not by double-faced politicians but by men of judgment with only their country’s true interest at heart. (5) I have spoken frankly because the interests and preservation of the honour of the country demand full agreement, with Britain. People are too prone to be flattered by broadcast statements/statements of certain foreign powers; they must realise that these statements are made purely in the interest of themselves and to sow discord between Arabs and British* These people are not acting.in the interests of the Arabs. Even if there weszr any truth in their broadcasts, it is .quite impossible that if they gained their aims they would treat Arabs as.well as British have treated them. (4) The above is my advice to the Arabs., My knowledge of you leads me to hope that you will inform me that you are in agreement. If not I shall have done my duty. You know how highly I place the interests of my country and the Arabs but I value more highly ny honour and keeping of my word and in what I have said, I have been inspired solely by my love of the Arabs, Iraq and yourself, and my loyalty and friendship for the British Government.

I have no reason to doubt Nuri Pasha's genuine loyalty ! and sincerity even though he may riot always be quite frank. His whole record during and preceding present crisis and for long time past beginning with Lawrence has been pro-British. He is so identified with such a policy that it would be difficult for him to change even if he v/ished to. He is of course also a Pan-Arab and after the war had gone so badly for us in the early summer. I had the impression that Nuri Pasha felt it would be prudent to consider eventuality of a British defeat. This impression of wavering was strongest at the time of Nuri Pasha's visit to Egypt (see my telegram to Foreign Office.445 repeated to you 139 and Jerusalem telegram to Colonialuffice repeated to Cairo No. /5, August 14th) and might have promoted [?enquiries] of Egyptian Prime Minister. That visit, despite his conversations with Ali Maher, did Nuri Pasha a lot of good and started restoration of his confidence which now seems well established.

Please inform Minister for Foreign Affairs of astonishment with which I have learned that pardon of individuals in question, after so short a time has 'been under consideration. You t should point out that their pardon would inevitably give the impression that the Iraqi authorities were inclined to treat with special leniency those found guilty of crimes of violence against the persons of His Majesty s representatives in Iraq, and that such action 'by Iraqi Government might thus even lead to further outrages of the same kind. 2. You may if you think it desirable express orally to General Nun and Regent my appreciation of the stand which they have taken. Their action has I am sure 'been in the true interests of Iraq, and I sincerely regret that the ill-advised proposal of the Prime Minister should have compelled me to approach the Iraqi Government on a matter which would have preferred to leave to their own sense of what is fit.

I spoke to the Minister for Foreign Afiairs at once.

I pointed out that the serious view taken by you.of Iraqi activities had not been modified by our recent victories. 2. He then repeated to me the account of recent . conversation of Assistant Secretary General with Iraqi Minister here, who had brought every assurance from his Government tnat they had no intention of renewing relations with Germany. l said that your experience was that such assurances could not be trusted, also that your present instructions did not refer specifically to resumption of relations with Germany but to the generally unsatisfactory policy qf the Iraqi Government. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he was quite ready to act as desired but would like further details as to the unsatisfactory character of Iraqi policy. 1 said I would ask you for these. 4 0 (s ,, ‘C n &gt; Meanwhile he undertook to instruct the Turkish Minister at'Bagdad to point out to the Iraqi Government tnat Turkey, as a member of the Saadabad Pact and an ally ol Great Britain, was seriously concerned at the present policy oi the Iraqi Government, which tended to conilict with lurKisn and British interests. The Minister was to draw serious attention to this and to express the hope of an improvement. 5c(sic) I suggested that the Turkish Minister at Bagdad should obtain any necessary details from Sir B.

Since it is most unlikely that Rashid Ali would agree himself to carry through the severance of relations with Italy, I doubt whether General Nuri’s argument need deter us from pressing this issue. There is, however, another argument which has hitherto caused me to hesitate toirstmctyou definitely to press Iraqi Government to choose this moment to break with Italy, namely, that such a request might provide the Prime Minister with better platform for rallying support than his present line that we are interfering in internal affairs of Iraq* Italian reverses should have weakened opposition to rupture with Italy, but I leave it to your discretion to decide whether it is preferable to make definite issue out of matter before Rashid Ali resigns, or to get rid of him first and then let it be known that His Majesty* s Government regard rupture with Italy as essential prerequisite of the establishment of normal relations with us. In any case, if challenged on the point, you should, I thin&amp;, certainly make it clear that His Majesty's Government will regard this step as essential. 3. As stated in my telegram No^ 641.. [of Decenffcer U-th], I think that we must press hard for immediate change of government. I am not at all attracted by complicated scheme evolved by General Nuri (your telegram Na*-_Z£6jof December 12th]) and note that there has already been delay in getting ahead even with first stages of it. Unlcsa he has made definite progress by the time you receive this telegram, I think that you should press him as strongly as possible to adopt what seems the much sinrpler course of making public his resignation and leaving Rashid Ali, with what support he can find to cope with the diff iculties caused by his unwise provocation of His Majesty 1 Government and their friends. You may tell him that I find it increasingly hard to understand that, when he has' made it plain in his whole past career that he appreciates the fundamental importance for Iraq of a policy of close co-operation2. co-operation with this country, he can remain any longer in a Government headed by a man whose deliberate aim is the reversal of that policy. l-o I have reason to think that Iraqi Government are fully alive to possibility of pressure, economic and otherwise, from us and our friends. * In your telegram No. 772, you suggest that we should threaten to take economic sanctions against Iraqi Government if they do not meet our requirements by a given date. As a means of pressure, action should be even more.effective than threats, and I have already arranged that applications for dollars shall be either refused or held up 0 Request that contract for telephone exchange should be brought under credit has also been turned down (see my telegram No, oil [of November 29th])* and urgent consideration will be giver to the question whether any of the further steps suggested by ou can be put into effect forthwith. (I should warn you that introduction of navicert system cannot, however be regarded as a means of exerting pressure, since this is a step which His Majesty’s Government intend to take in any case, regardless of the attitude which'Iraqi Government may later adopt) 0 You may, therefore, make it plain that until we are satisfied as to policy of Iraqi Government, we can and will do nothing to assist them in economic matters. Yqu may instance dollars, credit and, purchases in Iraq, but should not of course give the impression that our economic pressure will stop there. . * : Repeated to Cairo No. 1581.OUTWARD TELEGRAM [This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept under Lock and Key.] E. 5092/448/93, 1 DISTRIBUTION B.

His Majesty’s Government have serious cause for dissatisfaction with present Iraqi Government particularly with the Prime Minister, who has been openly adopting a policy totally inconsistent with the Anglo- Iraqi Alliance. His Majesty's Government therefore felt it necessary to draw serious attention of Iraqi Regent and Cabinet to this state of affairs which, unless° remedied, is bound to lead to grave crisis in Anglo-Iraqi relations. They have also had to make it clear that in view of their past experiences they are not prepared to attach credence to any assurances from the Prime Minister of his desire to cooperate with us. In fact, though we have not said so officially to the Iraqi Government in so many words, we see no possibility of improvement so long as Rashid Ali remai in office. 2. In view of the special attention which is always accorded in Iraq to policy of Turkish Government, I think it would be most helpful if they made some demarche to Iraqi Government on lines of that from United States Government. Unless you see serious objection, please explain the position to Minister for Foreign Affairs and enquire whether Turkish Government would be prepared to send necessary instructions to their Minister at Bagdad, Repeated to Bagdad No. 651 and Cairo No. 1548,f7( £ te&lt;j2 h« With tb* fos* Fore is 3^7 • U'e*!

In view of my knowledgeof attitude, and in particular paragraph 3 of your telegram No. 636 a nd in order to strike while the iron was hot I felt justified in taking the first opportunity' of pressing strongly for the removal of the Italian Legation* 2. I therefore told the Minister for Foreign Affairs this evening that its retention had been poisoning Anglo-Iraqi relations for long enough, ffe had no intention of embroiling Iraq in the war and no desire to involve her unnecessarily in any real military danger. As a result of the Greek victories y of the establishment of Allied forces in Crete, and the crushing blow inflicted on the Italian forees in Egypt, it was now obvious that there could be no such danger and the sooner therefore the Italian Legation went the better. 3. I explained that although I had received no fresh instructions on this subject from my Government, I was well aware how strongly they objected to the presence of the Italian Legation at Bagdad and within the last v/eek they had informed me that one of their chief complaints against the Rashid Ali Government was its failure to break off diplomatic relations v/ith Italy, The Italian Legation at Bagdad v/as in fact a standing cause of suspicion and offensive to us and its removal' would be essential if Anglo-Iraqi relations were to be restored to a better footing* 4. I went on to say that quite recently I had learnt that the staff of the Legation had been increased by two diplomatic officers and a man who calls himself a clerk and that abnormal consignments had been reaching the Legation under cover of diplomatic bags. In the present circumstances it v/as clear that its activities v/hich were carried on under cover of the immunities and protection granted by the Iraqi Government were directly hostile to Iraq ? s British ally, and that these activities were being considerably increased. IncidentallyIncidentally I mentioned that since the Axis declaration was 'broadcast from Berlin, Rome had on two occasions broadcast to the Arabs inciting them to rise against the British, 5. The Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed with my remarks but said that it would be a pity to press Rashid Ali at this moment as, if he gave way, it would make it more difficult to turn him out of office. He said that he thought the right time to press this issue would be at Cabinet discussions which he expected would follow his letter (see paragraph 3 of my telegram IFo, 766) » The projected declaration by Rashid Ali has, however, already been postponed for a day for trivial reasons and should there be further delay Your Lordship may think it opportune to apply strong pressure perhaps on the lines indicated in my immediately following telegram,, Repeated to Cairo telegram No. 23L*• 72- -i Decypher.

My jjnmecLi&amp;tely preceding telegram. I might be instructed to inform Iraqi Government tnat His Majesty's Government consider retention_oi the Italian Legation to be inconsistent with the Anglo-iraqr tieaty, paragraph 4 of which might be cited. His Majesty s Govern ment have po desire to involve Iraq in any military danger but as it is now obvious that no such danger exists His Majesty's Government requests that arrangements be made without further delay for departure of a Legation whos&lt; activities can only ally. tv for departure ox a L&lt; He hostile to those of _raq s British 2. If Rashid Ali were still in power and as is to be anticipated made difficulties I feel that by then applying^ strong pressure we might be able to bring down two^Dirds witn one stone* It is of course* impossible to predict Iraqi reactions with any certainty but you may think the risk their being unfavourable worth taking in the present ciroumstances? Further action I have in mind as.a necessary sequel to that in paragraph 1 would be an intimation to tne effect that if the decision requested had_not been taxen oy a certain date His Maje sty ron I s Government would have to consider to what extent they cou'Jd continue to accorq. to^Iraq facilities which have hitherto been provided without s t j n Cc 3* His Majesty's Government world then apply to Iraq either all at once or progressively the kind of disabilities suffered by firms on Statutory List* That is to say, # wi up hold (a) banking (b) financial (c) free trading i.o) snipping facilities, and reinforce what action we ourselves can take by securing co-operation of friendly countries.suon^as one United Stages and Dutch Fast Indies* Steps wiiiou might be considered include the following; -- (a) (1) Supply of dollars from United kingdom to be stopped., (2) No more credits in any currency to be opened or negotiated by British banking for Iraqi in ceres .? (b)/(b) Suspension of further shipments under credits agreement. (c) Immediate introduction of Navicert system to Iraq, in order to give us control over inward trades.

Such measures are all that I think^advisable for the present and combined, with discredit which is being brought to Italians by events in Albania and North Africa, they may prove fairly effective. If, however, Your Lordship takes different view I would recommend that stronger action should be delayed until it is po-ssible to send troops to Iraq. It would then be possible to grasp the nettle more firmly, although in any event it would not seem possible for us ourselves to lay bands on the Mufti in this country without m effect taking over reins of Government.

Only a few days ago the Prime Minister had once more spoken to him on the same subject, and he had again advised that the sentences should be allowed to stand* He did not know what further action the Prime Minister might have taken, but he undertook that enquiries should be made, I expressed my surprise at the Prime Minister's sympathy with the idea of a pardon for these murderers, and told the Minister for Foreign Affairs how, last spring, I had personally shown Rashid Ali what my attitude tov/ards any such idea was likely to be, by urging him to see that the police did not relax their efforts to capture the fugitive who was believed to have been His Majesty’s Consul’s principal assailant. I added that any proposal made without consulting His Majesty’s Government to release within 2 years the men who had been condemned to 15 years imprisonment for the murder of a British Consul, v/hose guilt had been legally established, and whose youth alone had saved them from the gallows, would inevitably be regarded by my Government as further evidence of the Prime Minister’s entire inability to appreciate even the elementary conditions of good relations with'His Majesty’s Government.

I also referred to communication by United States Minister (see my immediately preceding telegram) and to the light it threw on the situation created by Prime Minister. y 2. Nuri Pasha who was present seemed confident that a majority of his colleagues were agreed that Rashid Ali must go and thought that it might be possible to pass vote of '‘no confidence” in the Chamber. In any case he would be prepared to make public his own resignation at an appropriate moment in the Chamber, and to attack the Prime Minister on a number of domestic grounds. He hoped however, before Prime Minister fell, to be able to induce him to commit himself to a public declaration of the support, which he had so often professed in private, for i Anglo-Iraq alliance.

My American colleague called this morning to infonn me of communication to the following effect which he was about to make to the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs on instructions of his Government. 2. Policy of United States Government is to give to Great Britain in the present struggle all aid short of going to war. Any lessening of co-operation by Iraq will therefore make a most unfortunate impression.m the United States. Moreover cpmparisOTS to the detriment oi Iraq will be drawn between its attitude and that of Turkey. United States Minister was furthermore instructed to point out that continuance of Iraqi independence depended on a British victory. _He was to inform me oi this communication and also our Turkish colleague*. 3 I have naturally kept my American colleague informed of situation but I have never made.any suggestion for action on his part nor did he in any way indicate that above step by his Government is * [?in response] * to any suggestion of his own.

Regent who is young and inexperienced seems, as Nuri Pasha has himself observed to me, to have been rather weak in his interviews with Rashid Ali. By consenting to the Prime Minister's proposal to see me with the object of putting the matter right the Regent transferred to me perhaps'[? unwittingly] ^&lt; 0 ^ responsibility for the plain speaking in my telegram No. 714 . I felt such language was fully_justified by your instFuctions' T and that in the circumstances i should let the Regent down if I refrained from repeating to Rashid direct the sense of what I had already said to His Royal Highness. I hope th t my statement may have helped to overcome hesitations to which Iraqis are so prone and I believe it has done good by making it clear to a wider circle that the patience of His Majesty's Government was becoming exhausted. 3^ Since then Rashid has been making conciliatory overtures and trying to put the blame for the attitude of the press on to Taha. At the' same time he has been conveying threat that if his overtures are not accepted he will mobilise the nation in resisting British interference. In this latter atcempt he is having little success so far as I can at present judge, though no doubt he will greatly intensify his efforts when he realises that he personally cannot conciliate His Majesty's Government. I fancy however that the more the Iraqis reflect upon the danger and consequences of falling foul of Great Britain the less they will want to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of Rashid. ~li Jaudat (recent Minister for Foreign affairs) made a point of telling me yesterday that he knew it to be quite untrue that Jamil Madrai would support Rashid any more than he would himself. (See first part of paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 754) . Today I have pointed out to Nuri Pasha (who is still functioning as Minister for Foreign Affairs) that I had never said that Iraq must choose between the Prime Minister and its relations with Great Britain. He replied that he knew this and gave the explanation that this statement had been inserted by some of his colleagues in order to make such Iraqi [? dependence] more pointed. I have also spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the sense of paragraph 3 of your telegram No. 622 and read certain passages from your telegram No. 615 including one showing that you had no desire to interfere with internal affairs or do anything inconsistent with the dignity of the Iraqi State and the whole of paragraph 7. Paragraph 8 was too corrupt for me to use but the correction has since Seen decyphered. Tomorrow I will make the attitude of His Majesty's Government clear to the Regent and will report on steps which he may have in mind for the elimination of Rashid.

Affaires came to see me on 29th November at his own request. 2. He said that he had been instructed by General Nuri to speak about your recent representations to the Iraqi Government. In reply to your complaint regarding correspondence between Iraqi postal authorities and Italian and German postal authorities, General Nuri had stated, on the authority of the Council of Ministers, that that v/as merely routine correspondence which had always been maintained since the beginning of the war. Minister for Foreign Afxairs had further replied that there was no foundation at all for allegation that Iraqi Government have prohibited criticism in Iraqi newspapers of' German Declaration. Your Excellency had stated that Iraqi Government were believed to be thinking of re-opening diplomatic relations with Germany, either through Italian Minister at Bagdad or by some other means. Charge d’Affaires said that Iraqi Government knew nothing of what might be intentions of German Government in this respect, but for themselves were, as always, most anxious .to continue to maintain alliance w T ith Great Britain and to apply Anglo-Iraqi Treaty in letter and spirit. As regards suggestion that Iraqi Government intended to enact anti-Jewish legislation, Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed you that such legislation was impossible, since it would be contrary to constitution of Iraq. 3. In spice of these explanations, you had stated that His Majesty’s Government did not trust Iraqi Prime Minister and that Iraq must choose between Prime Minister and continuance of good relations with Great Britain. General, Nuri wisher me to know that Iraqi Government were astonished at this statement, which seemed to them contrary to spirit of Anglo-Iraqi treaty and to standards of international courtesy, and to infringe dignity and independence of Iraq. He could not believe that such a statement could have been made on instructions from His Majesty’s Government, particularly at a moment when there was really no dispute between the tv/o countries with regard to application of treaty. 4. I tola Charge d ! Affaires that I was very much obliged for message which he had given me. I hoped however that he would report to General Nuri that action which Your Excellency had taken had been on my direct instructions. Position was that His Majesty’s Government attached great importance, as I was glad to see General Nuri did also, to maintenance of good /relationsrelations between our two countries. It was clearly in interests oi* both or us that our relations should be as close as possible. For that reason I had felt justified ^ in instructing you to spea^: so frankly. I could not conceal from Iraqi Government that we had not received from Prime Minister degree of co-operation to which we considered ourselves entitled under Treaty and, if we were to prevent matters from going from bad to worse, to the disadvancage of both our countries, it had seemed to us necessary that you should speak frankly to Minister for Foreign Affairs. 5. Turning to the various points in General Nuri’s reply, I said that I took note of what ne said as regards.question of postal correspondence and that if I had any further communication to make, I would ask you, to convey it- to the Iraqi Government. As for German Declaration, I had certainly been under impression that thare were good grounds for believing that criticism of it had in fact been restrained by Iraqi authorities, but in view of General ITur^s assurance to the contrary, I had no more to say about that for the moment. As regards the general question, we had, as Iraqi Government knew, no desire to interfere in their internal affairs, nor to do anything inconsistent with dignity of Iraqi State. At the same time, we were concerned to see that our relations were as harmonious as possible and, as I certainly diu not think that prime Minister*s conduct of affairs had been conducive to maintenance of such relations, only franii course had been for me to send you instructions which you had carried out. 6. Charge d’Affaires said that he wished to impress upon me that General Nuri considered it very serious indeed for such a request as this to be made at such a time anu on such inadequate grounas. If carried out, it would be bound to have serious repercussions in Iraq which could not possibly be in the interests either of that country or of Great Britain. 7. I asked him to believe that I should not have sent theoe instructions without being convinced that there was ample ground. I fully recognised gravity of step, but I had no doubt at all that continuance of present state of affairs was not conducive to maintenance of the good relations which we all desired. I knew General Nuri personally and had great respect for him and His Majesty’s Government wished to give all the help they could to his country. But we must expect similar attitude on the part of the Iraqi Government, without which present friendly relations could not continue. 8. Charge d’Affaires askeu whether he must inform his Government that our demand for removal of Prime Minister stood. I replied that I had already said that you had spoken on this matter with my full authority. I regarded your conversation with General Nuri, like my present conversation with Charge d*Affaires, as frank talk between friends. The only people who could benefit from our failure fo agree would be third parties who did not wish well to either of us. I would certainly give full consideration to message from Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I’hoped that Charge d’Affaires would make it plain to his Government that you were speaking with my full authority.

There are several ways in which this might be done, but the least objectionable is to induce or force the Iraqi Government to take effective action. 2. Me are, as you know, in a position to approach the Iraqi Government, whenever we think the appropriate moment has arrived, and tell them that the Mufti is in the pay of the Italians, that he is endeavouring to help the Axis by arming Arab bands to be used for sabotage and guerilla warfare in the rear of our troops, and that he gives Italians inf ormati on regarding British troop movements and targets for bombing. The fact that conclusive evidence in our possession cannot be produced to the Iraqi Government does not, I think much matter, since they must already have more than a suspicion of the Mufti's activities. It would be pointed out to the Iraqi Government that such a violation of the assurances given at the time of the Mufti's arrival in Iraq is not only an offence against us, but also against them and fully entitles them to ta. e the most drastic action against the offender. Me would point out that we take a very serious view of the Mufti's action and that we must insist that, if the Iraqi Government want us to continue to assist them, they must take immediate and effective action to stop it. You could make plain that this matter will constitute for us an effective test of their goodwill. 3. The main difficulty, on which I shall be glad to receive Your Excellency's views, is to know what effective action we can and should insist_upon. the Iraqi Government taking. The Iraqi Government might refuse to allow Mufti any longer to live in Bagdad and arrange for him to live at some other town in Iraq under police supervision. This mig.t check his political activities to some extent, but would not be sufficient to stop them. Even if special arrangements could be made whereby his supervision was in the hands of British police officers, it seems doubtful whether adequate control over his activities could be ensured so long as he remained in Iraq. Another line which the Iraqi Government might take would be to refuse Mufti permission to reside any longer in Iraq, and to twll him that he must make arrangements to leave, but in that case he would probablyprobably go to Syria, where his presence would be no less dangerous to us if his political activities against us were - uncontrolled. On the whole, it would appear that we should have to press for him to be handed over to us, and that we in return should have to give Iraqi Government some guarantees regarding his treatment* if. I realise that no Iraqi Government is likely to agree to this^ solution in present circumstances. The way will have to be carefully prepared. Plan of campaign might be more or less as follows. First, whispering campaign in Arab countries tnat the Mufti is in Italian pay and is acting as an Italian_ secret service agent. Later, an ‘'unconfirmed report', origin of which might be attributed to one of Mufti’s supporters disgusted with his acceptance of Italian offers, rniwlxt be telegraphed to London press and given wide publicity in Arab broadcasts and by other means. Parliamentary question might be answered by stating that His Majesty’s Government are making he necessary enquiries, and this reply might also receive wide publicity,. 5. . Action taken in.Iraq might be supplemented by further action m Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Egyptian Government might be.told that we have reliable information that the Mufti has been M-ibed by the Italians to start revolt in Palestine, to draw off troops and weaken defence of Egypt; Egyptian Government might be asked to address urgent representations to the Iraqi Government.demanding immediate action to stop these activities. Ibn Saud might be told that, in return for bribes frofti the Italians, the Mufti is encouraging them to extend air action against Palestine and has promised to stage a revolt of the Arabs to assist Italian planes for dominating the Middle East* 6 c I recognise desirability of ridding Iraq of Mufti’s Palestinian supporters, as recommended in your telegram No. 660. I understand that.these people, with the exception of Jamal Husseini and possibly a small number of others, are not excluded rom Palestine by the Palestine Government, and are at liberty to return whenever they wish. Many Palestinian emigres have in fact already returned. Others however are afraid that if they return they will at once^be charged with, and perhaps convicted'of, some murder or other crime committed during the disturbances. The Palestine Government Have however shown themselves willing to encourage the return of innocent persons. They have been^ready to state, whenever approached by individual emigres, ’whether or not there were outstanding charges against them. Further reassuring factors are that persons accused of offences committed Delore the restoration to civil courts of their powers will nevertheiess be tried in the civil, and not the military, courts; ana that the lauter.courts are no longer able to impose the eath penalty.

On the other hand without having received the foregoing, the American N.inister at Bagdad has learnt from his colleague in Tehran that according to two good sources in Iran (one of which the Minister assumes to be His Majesty*s Legation) two German officers have reached Tehran and under Dr. Grobba’s superintendence from Berlin will work through any channels available to encourage the resumption of diplomatic relations between Iraq and Germany and also to promote anti-Jewish legislation in Iraq (compare your telegram No. 293).

Firstly, I said that though I had no instructions to ask Iraai Government to break off diplomatic relations with Italy just now, their refusal to take this step^for which Prime Minister was mainly responsible) at the time when it would have been easy to take and when I had pressed for it had caused very bad impression in London, Secondly, I referred to frequent press declarations that policy of ^rime Minister's Cabinet was one of complete neutrality and to Prime Minister's failure either to suppress such statements which were usually expressly coupled with his name or to reiute them by a clear pronouncement of his intention to co-operate fully with His Majesty's Government. Thirdly, Prime Minister had persistently decided [sic] to accede to my repeated request that he should give proper guidance to public opinion as to the true interest of Iraq in close collaboration with His Majesty's Government. Fourthly, I referred to two specific points dealt with in my aide-memoire and Finally, I said that whether or not there was any truth in the current stories about the Prime Minister's intrigues with the Italian Minister and the axis Powers, his policy as shown above had encouraged such stories and he had done nothing convincing to deny or counteract them.

Newton (Bagdad) 26th November, 194-0, • R. 4-. 30 a.m, D. 10.30 p.m, 26thNovember, 194-0. 28th November, 1940 No. 714, My telegram No. 709 After my audience with Nuri Pasha, Regent sent first for Minister for Communications, Minister for Defence, and then for Prime Minister, all of whom denied any knowledge of the resumption of telegraphic communications with Germany and Italy 0 Despite the preference which he had expressed for using some internal grounds for getting rid of the Prime Minister, the Regent deferred any decisive step until the Prime Minister had had opportunity of seeing me, which he did at the Embassy this morning. 2. At considerable length the Prime Minister explained to me that his policy was one of sincere collaboration with His Majesty’s Government, repeated above denial saying that he would be prepared after investigation, to revoke Post Office decision, and assured me that there was no question of a resumption of diplomatic relations with Germany, nor any truth in the story associated with Naji Shaukat. 3, I dealt with these three matters in reverse order. I told him of communication which I had made to the Regent in accordance with your telegram No. 393, and as there seemed to be (hV f *) some con ^ us i° n i n bis mind, made it clear that this communication was quite separate from the S'tory of the proposals said to have been quoted by Naji Shaukat from Istanbul. I explained that I had felt it would be unwise to disregard this story as being merely malicious, seeing that it had reached me from three different sources, that first proposal had in fact been realised, and that as a result of information obtained in London I had subsequently been instructed to convey an official warning in regard to the third proposal. 4-. In reply to his denial of any knowledge of resumption of telegraphic communications, I observed that information of such an intention had reached me two or three days before the announcement and that I had then hoped it would prove to be merely a malicious story. A full announce lent had however appeared in the press October/^ October 31st and been the subject of much comment. Instructions had also been sent from Bagdad tb the Post Office which is under Iraqi administration in Koweit to accept telegrams for Germany and Italy. Moreover it was as long after announcement as November 25t that he denied knowledge of such an important step. This doubt as to facts could not be explained to the satisfaction of Kis Majesty’; Government. 5. Finally I observed that I had only discussed the above two matters because he himself had dwelt on them. It was, however, too late to go into specific cases and details. When he had assumed office he had told me his policy would be one of sincere and wholehearted collaboration v/ith His Majesty’s Government. He had now just renewed these assurances. Unhappily in practice actions for which he was responsible, not once nor twice but a long continued series of actions, had been at variance with those assurances and he had now lost the confidence of His Majesty’s Government in his ability to collaborate jdth them. 6 . He then showed that assurances will lack meaning as v/ell as sanctity by rejoining that he considered his actions to have been entirely in accordance with his assurances. 7. Subsequently I informed the Regent and Nuri Pasha of what I had said to the Prime Minister. At the close of my audience I reminded Minister for Foreign Affairs of a statement he had made to me last night that if Prime Minister did not resign he himself would do so, Nuri Pasha confirmed this intention.

I mentioned also paragraph if. Regent assured me that the action intended to secure early exposure of the Prime Minister would he taken without delay, 2. Nuri Pasha had previously told me that the Regent had reason for taking the view that in some matter which was not specified the Prime Minister had acted in a high-handed and unconstitutional manner. Both he and the Regent were inclined to think it better to join the issue with the Prime Minister in this or some other internal ground, rather than on that of dissatisfaction of His Majesty*s Government, with his foreign policy, I replied that this was a matter for them to judge. I personally found it difficult to believe that any responsible and patriotic Iraqi could wish to support a Prime Minister who tried to curry favour with Governments with such records and ambitions as those of Germany and Italy and who was estranging the one Government which had been proved by the history of Iraq to be its true friend and whose support was obviously vital for Iraq. 3, I also suggested to the Regent that he should make sure that no important decisions were taken behind his back recalling the resumption of telegraphic communications with Germany and Italy and the story in my telegram No. 697. 4 m,m —“ ’ Repeated to Cairo telegram No. 192 0Repeated to Cairo telegram No. 191.

I am taking the earliest opnortunity to act on your instructions. 2. Nuri Pasha has himself told me that he had asked the Italian Minister if he would give him the official text of the German broadcast declaration (which was also sent from Bari) and it would seem natural that he should at the same time ask what practical apolication it had to Syria and Palestine. His underlying suggestion to me was that the declaration so far appeared to be literally only in the air. and that, in any case, the result cf his enquiry would help to expose its worthlessness. I am not, however, satisfied that this reveals the whole truth and think it probable that the Iraqi hope has been to use it to extract more precise advances firstly from the Axis and then perhaps from ourselves. 5. Nuri Pasha* s quite recent mention of his failure to obtain any v/ritten text implies that Naji Shaukat had kept secret from him the text given by von Papen. It might therefore be of value (provided there is no strong objection and the information is thoroughly reliable) if I could tell the Regent and Nuri Pasha what we know [ group undecypherable ? of ] I.aji’s [? group omitted ? conversation] witn von rapen at Angora. Such information might be useful to them in [? group omitted? procuring a change of Government. 4. The story in my telegram No.fiSS- reached me from more than one source. To meet the possibllit * that the whole matter has been kept secret from both the Regent and Nuri Pasha, I propose in any case to suggest to the Regent that he should satisfy himself by direct enquiry of the Prime Minister and perhaps Taha or other important Tiembers of the Cabinet that' no such information has in fact been withheld from his knowledge and that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that there is no danger of serious action being taken of which they would disapprove.OUTWARD TELEGRAM Repeated to Cairo No«1381. fm s [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept under Lock and Key.] O 3 : 1940 (E.2676/G) DEPARTIv'MTAL (SECRET) ( 3 ) Cypher telegram to Sir B e Newton (Bagdad), Foreign Office, 22nd November, 19A0, 3o30 p P iiL No. 593. zzzzzzzzzzz li^PORTANT ^v*\\ My telegram No e 591 [of November 22nd: telegraph facilities CL**'*' between Iraq and Germany] 0 After you have taken action on my telegram under reference, I suggest that it would be well for you to tell the Regent, and possibly General Nuri also, that you have heard that the Italians are likely to attempt to persuade Iraqi Government to restore diplomatic relations with Germany. You might say that you have no doubt that such an attempt would at once be rejected by the Iraqi Government in the most emphatic terms. . We should expect the Iraqi Government to point out to the Italians that such action on their part would be totally inconsistent with the spirit of the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance, which the Iraqi Government are determined to implement. 2. You might add that, should any suggestion as regards the desirability of restoring relations with Germany be ventilated publicly in the Iraqi press or in other Iraqi quarters, it will be up to the Iraqi Government at once to make a public statement declaring that the resumption of diplomatic relation^ with Germany would be contrary to the spirit of the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance, and is therefore out of the question in present circumstances. 3. If your discussions lead you to suspect any serious danger of relations with Germany being renewed you should indicate plainly, without entering into particulars, that such a policy on the purt of Iraqi Governmenb would entail a revision of policy of His Majesty's Government, with most serious results to Iraq.Repeated to Cairo No.1380.

If the present Prime Minister were left m office meanwhile, danger of forcible resistance by Colonel Salahuddin who commanded or controlled troops in and near Bagdad would be lessened and could be healt with later more easily if Madfai were Minister of the Interior and he himself Minister of Defence. 3.

He seems to be well supplied with money and through his direction of committees and similar organisations contain ing Iraqi, Palestinian and Syrian members he exertedmuch^ influence over all matters of importance to Arab nationalism. In addition through his 300 Palestinian followers now in Iraq with whom are joined a number of Syrian extremists he carries on a formidable and persistent whispering campaign in his own interests. 3. He is in close touch with Cabinet, especially Taha Hashimi, and in times of crisis such as that vfnich followed General Nuri’s resignation last March he seems to be consulted by most of those concerned. A. He makes an ostentatious appearance on all public occasions and is usually given a place in the Cabinet enclosure. He is also careful to appear frequently at public prayers at the principal mosques of the capital. 5. My American colleague who has recently returned from leave in Syria and Palestine is impressed by the stren^n of the Mufti's position there as well as in Iraq and by the possibility that he might prove to be a leader who could really unite the Arabs. 6 . By contrast with the tarnished reputation of Iraqi politicians the Mufti appears here as one with an unblemished record of devoted service to the Arab.cause. Moreover by reputation he combines religious learning with political- acumen and patriotism and thereby appears to be endowed with qualities most respected by the /trabs. 7 . It must be expected that action against him will meet with resistance from his own organisations backed by consider able popular support.

CONFIDENT IAL The Prime minister told me on November 2nd that the budget position seemed to be very satisfactory 0 Nevertheless indications are accumulating that expenditure for the accounts of capital works (which is capital budget) and unforeseen commitments will severely tax the Iraqi Government's present resources&lt;&gt; Deterioration in the financial position may therefore soon add to the difficulties of the present Government and we should I think, be prepared for an eventual appeal for financial assistance* Meanwhile Rashid Ali's Cabinet have already asked for help (a) in disposal and shipment of the surplus barley crops and dates (see your telegrams Ncs 0 L22 and 624 and your telegram No„ 1-92) and (b) may need foreign exchange to buy war material (see my telegram 613 )* They may also ask for credit in India to purchase military supplies to be increased by a further Iraqi 250,000 dinars* Extent to which (a) and (b) cai be used as political levers depends of course on the extent of our own need or willingness to take these Iraqi products, and, as regards war material, on our own ability to supply. It is perhaps not too soon for His majesty’s Government to consider what should be their conditions or desiderata in return for such special financial and economic assistance as they would be prepared to give. I suggest the following for consideration; Although the rupture of relations with Italy presumably remains in the forefront, its importance seems to be chiefly as a political gesture* No doubt ^presence of legation facilitates* distribution of money but its removal would not close other contacts and the channels of communication available via Iran and Syria or other neighbouring countries. Until the consequences of the German occupation of Roumania and the Italian invasion of Egypt and Greece are clearer, there would be a considerable body of support for Rashid mli and others in objecting to,,, ^the rupture 0 ( 2 ) ihe tone oi the press and wireless-.broad-cxa^-te—- has improved slightly of ls.te and I presume that you would wish to insist upon further improvements. Public expression of support for His majesty's Government by the Iraqi Government or Piegent Blight also be suggested. (3) The opportunity might be taken to request closer control over the j.ufti and diminution of the number in Iraq of his supporters and of Palestinian teachers. Palestine would, of course, have to be willing to receive the latter back, (4) Students and young men have been left in ignorance of what Iraq o' as to Great Britain for its past and its future., 7e might press for reform and perhaps also suggest the appointment of a British adviser in the ministry of Education, (3) i.inis ter of m inane e has asked British vice- chairman of centra] committee to co-operate with the Commercial Secretary in checking doubtful re-exports but goods in transit would not be covered. Closer collaboration in controlling suspected trade is required. In unis connexion the smuggling of goods, particularly oil, to Syria might be mentioned, ( 6 ) introduction of a satisfactory system of exchang control. (7) I am dealing separately with the appointment of a financial adviser which would seem essential (see my letter to Sir II. Seymour number 432-3-1-0 of October 31st last). If financial aid is given, it would be help:! il if it could be arranged on an instalmart plan so that it could be stopped if the Iraqi Government failed to fulfil their undertakings.

Speech from Throne the good relations with the Arab countries and Regent referred to neighbours and to friendship with Great Britain. In the evening Nuri called on me in strict confidence and gave me account of the political situation. He had for some little time been thinking on account of the policy of the Prime Minister and had been dissuaded by Taha who had pointed out that it would be difficult to form a cabinet at present and that the oppcpsition in the Chamber might force the Prime Minister to mend his ways. Nuri did not make it clear who [? started] this opposition or on what grounds it would be.based but according to my information, group of some 15 deputies, mostly.Shiahs, are planning open criticism of the Government s foreign policy. They began on the opening day by.rumour c?f rivalry to Government nominee for speakership but without much success. Growing criticism in both Chambers on financial grounds is probable. Nuri went on to say that though he still thought Zaid was the best man to replace the present Prime Minister the idea had been dropped for the time. Many feared that 2 aid would intrigue against the Regent, but he was convinced himself that such fears were groundless. Nuri 1 s next choice was Taha but Taha f s present view was that he could not succeed without taking severe measures against certain elements and this he was loath to do. ui Jamil Madfai Nuri spoke without enthusiasm and said that he suffered from bad friends. He described the outlook as uncertain and blamed the Prime Minister for the attitude of the Press which did much harm. He left me with the impression that he doubted Taha 1 s advice and may therefore resign before long. He . said that the Regent continued to dislike the Prime Minister. As you are aware, there have already been one or 'two unfavourable crises and Rashid Ali cabinet will probably continue to weaken owing to growing financial difficulties, doubts as to wisdom of its foreign policy, and mere lapse of time. Process of dissolution, as in the case of the.last change of Government may however still be slow and.Rashid Alim likely to be quite unscrupulous and even reckless in his efforts to remain in power. In (? deciding] whether any action on our part to hasten the process is desirable, considerations in my telegrams Nos. 542 and 354 remain generally valid. Repeated to Cairo telegram No« 176.

Neivton to Viscount Halifcur.—{Received October 17.) Mv&lt;£ (No. 455. Confidential.) My Lord, Bagdad, September 28, 1940. THE anniversary of the beginning of the Arab revolt against the Turks, which is known in Arabic as the “ Id-al-Nadha,' was celebrated in Iraq by a number of broadcast speeches and special articles in the press. These manifesta tions of political sentiment and pan-Arab aspirations seemed to evoke no great enthusiasm, and their importance should not be exaggerated. At the same time they were typical of feelings and tendencies in leading political quarters, and as such I think it is desirable that they should be recorded and duly pondered. They are not encouraging. 2. As the Arab “ renaissance,” which is what the Arabic word “ Nadha ” means, was initiated by His Majesty’s Government in the last war, and its success was almost solely due to British efforts and sacrifices, it might have been thought that some kind of acknowledgment of this vital assistance would have been expressed. Above all in Iraq, and above all at the present time, such expression would seem appropriate and natural, seeing that, whatever disappointments other Arab countries may have suffered, Iraq at least has gained everything and lost nothing, that the independence won for this new country by British lives and money can only be ensured by the continuance of British support, and that every other country created as the result of the last war has for the time being at least lost its independence in the war now raging. Unhappily, I have to record that not even the merest lip-service was paid to the services of Iraq’s British ally; on the contrary, the references made to Great Britain were abusive and hostile. 3. Most of the broadcasts were inoffensive except for the latter part of an address by Colonel Kamil Shabib, the Officer Commanding the First Division of the Iraqi Army, who is one of the four army leaders considered to be of dominating political importance. I have the honour to transmit herewith a summary of this part of his address, and also extracts from the press.( l ) It will be seen that Colonel Shabib delivered over the radio much harsh comment on the alleged failure of the foreigners to keep their promises to the Arabs. In the press there was talk of the “clutches of the British lion,” of the betrayal of the Arabs by their Western Allies, and of the hope of deliverance from the heel of imperialism. Such were the expressions passed by the censor and used in the Arab country which owes its very existence to 92,000 British casualties, an immense increase in its prosperity to British co-operation, its retention of Mosul and the Kirkuk oil-fields to British diplomacy, and the assurance of its future progress and continued independence to the British alliance. It will be seen, too. that even in the midst of another great war, which has consumed vast areas and populations and overwhelmed every country created since the last war with the single exception of Iraq, people are reckless and foolish enough to complain that “ other nations have benefited while the Arab nation has not.” 4. It is because this spirit of ungrateful and short-sighted folly exists in high places (notably with the Prime Minister, Rashid Ali, and the Minister of Defence, Taha-al-Hashimi) that I spoke to the Minister for Foreign Affairs with the emphasis indicated in the last sentence of paragraph 4 of my telegram rbf'S No. 505 of the 31st August. On many previous occasions I have spoken' less blunily' but in a similar sense to the Prime Minister, to the present and the previous Ministers for Foreign Affairs, and to other political leaders, urging them to spread enlightenment by speeches, through the press and in the education of the youth. The press attache has also done all he can to diffuse knowledge of P) Not printed. [10-89]2 9 what Iraq owes to British help in the past, and of its vital need for British friendship in the future. Probably the chief politicians, particularly of the old school, realise at heart the truth of what we say, but both the Government and the press decline to act on such suggestions, and the Regent is perhaps the on v leader who seems both to realise the real position and to wish to act accordingly , ! ^ ii so far as he can. . , 4 , n i . „ 5 Jt is no doubt partly because Iraqi and Arab standards generally have not achieved a high level that we occupy our present position of predominance m the Middle East. To judge by the forecast contained in Mr. Houstoun-Boswall s teleerram No 133 of the 10th April, 1939, Iraqi behaviour towards Great Britain has been no worse—and, in fact, rather better—than might have been expected, having regard to the course of the present war. In drawing attention therefore to the unhappy manifestations described above. I do not wish to imply any criticism of our past policy towards Iraq, or to suggest that a different policy would have borne better fruit. Many critics have maintained that we abdicated our position too soon, and that it was unfair to give way to Iraqi clamours for full independence until we had at least trained a new generation to distinguish its friends from its foes, and to exercise its responsibilities with a greater measure of political common sense and of understanding of the true inteiests of Iiaq. I doubt myself whether we should thereby have gained a better stock of Iraqi goodwill or done more than postpone an eventual relapse to the low standards of political wisdom, moral courage and national tolerance which seem to be characteristic of this part of the world. At the same time I do think that it is very desirable that in taking decisions and shaping future policy His Majesty s Government should be under no delusions, and should realise that the geneiositv and. in fact, indulgence which they have consistently displayed towards Iraq have secured little recognition amongst the present generation, and none at all, to judge by the students and the junior officers in the army, amongst the younger generation. 1 6 .

The policy and methods of Rashid Ali in openly playing for safety in regard to Italy and war and in making himself a greater champion of Syria and Palestine than any local inhabitants are irritating and dangerous and have aggravated the ill effects which recent course of the war was in any case bound to produce. Nevertheless in the situation as described below I see no suitable alternative to Rashid Ali for the time being and my provisional conclusion is that it would be wiser not to try to force his resignation unless he were to oppose coming of British troops or for any other reason the situation became critical. 2. The chief political leader outside the cabinet is Jamil Madfai, with whom I nad a long informal talk on June 26th. He told me that when Italy declared war he had advised [?rupture] of re lations. Since thoi, however, (as British adviser to Ministry of the Interior agrees) doubts and fears of the government tea spread [grp. undec.] public who would in consequence be genuinely upset if the government after all that had been happening gave Italy what would be regarded as an unnecessary slap in the face.. It would be better, therefore, he considered, to await some new justification for rupture such as safety of British troops, transit or_special concessions in regard to Palestine and Syria.. Madfai said he had remained outside the present government in order not to antagonise influential army officers and he did not think any more represen tative government could be formed in the present circumstances. 5. Some time ago General Nuri told me that if^it became desirable under war condition to form a government of national concentration with exceptional powers he believed that the only man under whom all leaders could serve would be the Amir Zaid. On July 6 th I elicited that when at Angora Nuri had advised the Amir to return from Istanbul to Bagdad but ihe Amir had wanted more explanations than could be given except at a personal meeting. Nuri admitted also that the attitude of the Regent -towards the idea of a Zaid government- was uncertain. Nuri is^however evidently uneasy in regard to the political situation and said he might have to resign/I (rn\ 23 ^ 2 . resign if it got worse. If a change became essential and^there '-ere no alternative Prime Minister he would accept that oi±ice once more even 8 .t 8 . possible risk to his life, but he much -preferred to act at present as number 2 (in viju^h I think be^is right). At the same time Nuri acquitted Rashid All 01 oad xaith and ill-will towards British alliance. His chief laults were, Nuri believed his desire to please everybody and his consequent inability to give the lead that was so badly needed in_these critical times. Given time Rashid Ali will no doubt discredit himself and if we can afford to wait it would certainly seem preferable for him to fall as a result of domestic reasons rather than of direct pressure from us on an issue in which he can mobilize public support. The British adviser found him this morning genuinely anxious to dissociate himself irom recent articles in A1 Istiqlal and aware oi the lact that uno.er the treaty Iraq cannot be neutral.

THE Prime Minister dined with me as my only guest on the 24th May, and after dinner discussed with me the present internal situation in Iraq. 2. He began by telling me that the public attitude towards the war had been greatly improved by the measures which the Government had taken, and that further measures were under consideration. There had been a meeting of the High Defence Council, at which it had been decided that an ordinance should be issued giving wide powers to the Minister of the Interior to deal firmly with persons believed to be engaged in activities prejudicial to the welfare of the Kingdom, and that if this measure proved to be inadequate martial law T should be declared. Rashid Ali said that he had also talked with a number of tribal leaders from different parts of the country, and had sent them home with material with which to combat pro-Nazi talk. 3. I thanked his Excellency for the action already taken, the articles inspired in the press, the banning of demonstrations and all public gatherings, and for the further measures to which he was now about to give effect, but said that, to my regret, I was not able to agree with his view that all was now well. A beginning had been made, but it seemed to me that much remained to be done, especially in such places as Mosul, Kirkuk and Basra. 4. Information that I had received from these places showed that anti- British agitation was gaining rather than losing strength, and that for want of instructions from the Government the local mutasarrifs and other senior officials were taking no action either to check that agitation or to give an alternative lead to public opinion. I knew that orders had been given that no demonstrations were to be allowed, but this was not in itself enough; in order to avoid the danger of disorders it was essential that in the provinces as well as in Bagdad the Government should give a clear positive lead to the people to stand solidly behind them in their policy of close collaboration with Great Britain. I also pointed out that though it was a step in the right direction for the Government, like all other Governments, to take special powers to deal with treachery and treason within the country, it was almost equally important that they should inform the people of what they were doing a4id of the purpose for which these special powers would be used. At present the people in most parts of the country were still without a clear lead on many vital points concerning Iraq’s position in the war, and for want of that lead and for want of a knowledge of the measures that the Government were taking to maintain order, public opinion was in a dangerous state of nervous uncertainty. Much of this would be dispelled if the Government would tell the people at once of their intention to govern firmly and to deal severely with traitors and intriguers. 5. The Prime Minister said that he agreed with all that I had said, but felt obliged to remind me of a point that he had often made before. No matter what steps were taken by the Government to check malicious propaganda and to give a wholesome lead to public opinion, no real or lasting successes could be achieved in the development of a strong pro-British sentiment among the people unless the problem of Palestine was satisfactorily solved. No appeal to the people to rally to the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance would obtain a wide response unless it was coupled with a declaration of the removal of Arab grievances in Palestine. 6 . I said that I could not altogether agree with His Excellency’s view. It seemed to me that in Iraq the agitation about Palestine was carried on not so much by Iraqis as by the Palestinian refugees—people who were not concerned in Iraq welfare and whose sole object was to cultivate extraneous interests in Palestine. As regards a solution of the Palestine question. His Majesty’s [ 6 - 21 ] RECik POL. 0EFn 15 JON &lt;*40 INDIA OFFICEi I t '2 Government had already made a most sincere effort with the help of the represen tatives of the principal Arab States to lay down a policy that would safeguard Arab rights and interests, and that policy, as His Excellency knew, had been published in the white paper of May 1939. The application of the white paper policy had much improved the situation in Palestine, where the Arabs had on the whole accepted it, and it was therefore surprising that the bitterness in Iraq should have increased. This state of affairs suggested that the agitation in Iraq was largely artificial and due mainly to the constant efforts of the Palestinian refugees, to whom I had already referred. 7. The Prime Minister said that he was sorry he could not agree with me. He did not think that there had been any real change in the attitude of the Arabs of Palestine towards the white paper, and the fact that hundreds of Palestinian Arabs were still either in prison or in exile showed that the situation there was still far from normal. He maintained that agitation in Iraq about Palestine was not artificial. Ever since the end of the last war, long before any refugees had come to Iraq, whenever the Arabs of Palestine had been in difficul ties there Iiad always been sympathetic reactions in Iraq. The Arabs of Iraq were bound to those of Palestine by ties of blood, religion and culture. Iraqi interest in the Arabs of Palestine came from the heart and needed no artificial stimulus. He went on to say that though the white paper had not solved the problem of Palestine it had provided a basis for a solution. One or two small concessions and clarifications were all that was needed to make it acceptable to the Arabs, and it was his hope that before long it would be possible for him to enter into conversations with a view to studying these points and reaching agree ment concerning them. If that could be done Great Britain would find the Arabs standing firmly at her side in the struggle against Germany. I drew his attention to the fact that conversations were now taking place in London, hut he reolied that they dealt only with subsidiary matters, such as an amnesty. 8 . The Prime Minister then turned to the danger of enemy action based in Persia, referring, in particular, to the presence of over 2,000 Germans in and about Tehran, and to the reports which the Turkish Government had received (see my telegram No. 181) that the Russians were improving roads in North-West Persia. He said that the Iraqi Government were much concerned lest enemy action should be taken either openly or through fifth column activities from bases in Persia. I had at first the impression that he might he leading up to a request for British reinforcements, but he went on to say that Nuri Pasha had it in mind to talk to me about the possible advantages of seeking Turkish co-operation to deal with the danger. I said that I should, of course, be glad to discuss this suggestion with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but pointed out that as Turkey, in her Treaty of Mutual Assistance with France and Great Britain, had expressly stipulated that she would take no action likely to involve her in armed conflict with the Soviet Government, it was unlikely that she would commit herself to giving any armed assistance to Iraq against Russian aggression.

A Pitj&lt;U 'io My Lord, ^ ^ ” Bagdad, May 20, 1940. THE Cabinet formed by Rashid Ali at the beginning of April has now been in office for a little over six weeks, and it may be useful to review briefly its record and its present position. 2. In internal affairs the Prime Minister has sought to bring a measure of appeasement into the political atmosphere. He quickly dissolved the military court set up in the Rashid (Hinaidi) Cantonment close to Bagdad by his prede cessor in May 1939, and obtained a Royal reprieve for Sabih Najib, who, in peculiar circumstances, had been sentenced by this court for a minor misdemeanour after having been acquitted of a charge of being an accessory to the murder of the late Rustam Haidar, Minister of Finance. He is credited with a desire to release also Hikmat Sulaiman, another prominent Iraqi politician, who was convicted and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for conspiracy against the State by the same court in March 1939. In this desire he is said to be supported by Naji Shaukat and Naji Suwaidi, but opposed by Nuri Said and Taha-al- Hashimi, and stories are frequently heard of an impending split in the Cabinet over this dispute. Nevertheless, the Cabinet continues to present an apparently solid front to the country, and much more is said by the gossips about the internal differences in the Cabinet than by the Ministers themselves. 3. Another story which is freely told by those who pretend to inside know ledge of the Cabinet is that from the beginning there has been an understanding between Rashid Ali, the Suwaidis, and Jamil Madfai gradually to squeeze Nuri Said out of the Government and to eliminate him from politics by sending him as Minister to London. If any attempt has, in fact, been made to give effect to such a plan. Nuri Said, with the support of Taha-al-Hashimi, has evently so far been able to resist it. 4. On taking office the Prime Minister declared that the programme of his Cabinet did not differ in any essentials from that of Nuri Said’s Cabinet, and during the short period that remained of the current session of Parliament he was content to put through the legislation already prepared by the late Govern ment, and his own Cabinet did not themselves introduce any important measures. Similarly, in his personal talks with me, and no doubt on account of what he thought might be his reputation as an ardent nationalist, Rashid Ali has been at pains to assure me that he aimed at no change of attitude towards Great Britain or the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance, and intended to continue his predecessor’s endeavours to maintain and strengthen the closest friendly relations between Iraq and Great Britain. At the same time he has intimated that in order to retain public confidence his Government would have to encourage and lead the patriotism of the younger generation, and show a readiness to work with them for the realisation of their national hopes and aspirations. His intentions have been, I think, genuine, but he has little sense of reality and may fail to see the danger to Iraq of the purely emotional patriotism, born of chimerical dreams divorced from fact, which is cultivated among the youth of Iraq to-day. 5 . Since Rashid Ali took office there has been a noticeable and somewhat disturbing movement towards more extreme views in public opinion, as I felt bound to warn him the other day (my te jegram No. 159 of 13th May). The fanaticism and propaganda of the numerous raiestmian And Syrian political refugees have been gaining influence, and anti-British sentiments are everywhere being more and more openly and emphatically expressed. I do not believe that Rashid Ali is himself responsible for this change, which is due more to external than internal causes, but a man with greater practical experience of the worldor with a quicker appreciation of the significance of current events would have done more than he has to stem the tide. Public feeling in this country towards Great Britain has been profoundly impressed by recent developments in the war. The withdrawal from Southern Is or way, the revelation of our numerical inferiority to our enemies in the air which came in the Mouse of Commons debate on the Norwegian campaign, and, during the last week, the overrunning of Holland and Belgium by the German army, are events that have severely shaken confidence in the certainty of an Allied victory. 1 he news of these events has, of course, been exploited with telling efiect by the German broadcast in Arabic, while the host of those who are jealous of our position, or hate us for our policy in Palestine and the French for their policy in Syria, have worked ceaselessly to turn popular feeling against the Allied cause. In this they have I been greatly helped by the news that has continued to arrive of heavy sentences | inflicted on Arabs by the military courts in Palestine and Syria. Each new batch of sentences provides fresh inflammatory material with which to kindle fires of hatred against Britain and France. 6 . With strong emphasis I have impressed on both the 1 rime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs the real danger of the deterioration in public opinion, and 1 have urged repeatedly the need for the Government to give a lead which would rally those who still see where Iraq s interests reallv lie, and check the insidious whispering campaign of those whose work, if successful, would destroy all that has been achieved in this country during the last twenty years. But though Rashid Ali, when talking with me, is always ready with bland assurances of his agreement with my views, he has told the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior and the oriental secretary that it is out of the question for him to make a public pronouncement condemning German aggression and rallying public opinion to the side of the Allies. He says that Nuri Pasha failed in this, and that for him to make the attempt would only make him publicly ridiculous and weaken his authority without making any impression on public opinion unless, so he implies, he could at the same time declare the establishment of an agreed policy between the Allies and the Arabs for the realisation of Arab ideals. In this connexion I am sending home separately a copy of a letter from the British adviser to the Ministry of the Interior in my despatch No. 223 o f the 20th May. Nuri Said, I am told, has tried to persuade 'Rashid All to give a reasonable and reassuring lead to public opinion, but without success. 7. Nevertheless, I learn that the Prime Minister has given orders to the police to keep a close watch on the activities of the Palestinian and Syrian refugees and other mischief-makers, and also to issue through the Press Bureau a directive to newspaper editors to publish articles condemning German aggression on small countries. The latter instructions have made no considerable impression on public opinion as vet. With few exceptions the press articles have been lukewarm in their condemnation of Germany’s brutal attacks on her weaker neighbours, and, so far as I can judge from the reports that reach me. public opinion is still growing more pro-German and anti-British. Owing to the strong instinct of the average Iraqi to seek the winning side, this development is likely to continue until the war news becomes more favourable. 8 .

The session had been interrupted by an adjournment of two months from the 15th November to the 15th January, and its prorogation therefore came at the end of the statutory period of four months. 2 .

Nevertheless, a great deal of parliamentary work has been accomplished. Over fifty laws have been dealt with by the Chamber, and most of these have also been passed through the Senate.

(No. 145.) My Lord, Bagdad, April 3, 1940. WITH reference to my telegram No, 106 of the 1 st April, reporting the formation of a new Cabinet under RasKid Ali-aLGailani. I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith a cutting^) from the Iraq Times of the 1 st April giving a translation of Nuri Said’s letter to the Regent explaining his resignation. 2 . The real reason was clearly the same as that of his earlier resignation on the 19th February : his realisation of the fact that the time had come for a change. The attempt made then to form a new Cabinet on a wider basis failed owing to the developments described in my despatc h No. 86 o f the 27th February, but Nuri Said told me, as reported in my tel egram No. 61 of the 23rd February, that he still hoped to succeed in his original intention. TTis difficulties in finding new colleagues when he was obliged to reform his Government must have made it even clearer to him than before that the time had come for another Prime Minister to take over the reins of Government. 3. The trial of those accused of the murder of Rustam Haidar having been ended and military intriguers having been overawed for the time being by the summary treatment of those who ventured to interfere in February, the way was made clear for another attempt to carry out the original plan of a new Cabinet under Rashid Ali. This time it did not miscarry, and. having regard to the complexity of the personal and political factors and the dangerous possibilities to which I have drawn attention in various despatches, it stands to Nuri Said's credit that a peaceful transition from one Government to another has at last been achieved. 4. The new Cabinet contains four members who have previously been Prime Ministers and the remainder have all had earlier experience of Cabinet office. There are two Shiahs and one Kurd. Nuri Said’s retention of the portfolio of Foreign Affairs is a sign that no change is intended in foreign policy or in the Government’s general attitude towards Iraq’s special relations with Great Britain. Amin Zaki’s transfer from Communications and Works to Economics will be welcomed by most of the senior British officials of the former Ministry, for he had been showing a tiresome tendency to interfere to excess in personal matters and in the technical work of his departments, but Rashid Ali’s assump tion of the portfolio of the Interior in addition to the presidency of the Council may prove to be a source of difficulty. His reputation at the Interior is bad, and. although in the course of a call this morning he has just mentioned to me that the Euphrates tribes have gone out of their way to show their satisfaction with his Government, he is not generally thought to enjoy their confidence. 5. The late Prime Minister himself is frankly pleased to be relieved of a considerable part of the heavy burden of responsibility that he has been bearing and is confident about the future. He feels that political discord has been largely silenced without any considerable loss to himself of position or influence, and he looks upon the retention in the new Cabinet of so large a proportion of his old colleagues as a safeguard for the continuation of his own policy. 6 . From my conversations with the Prime Minister and with Nuri Pasha, I judge that the individual members of the Cabinet are for the moment on their best behaviour towards each other, but I have some doubt whether this internal harmony will last for long. Much tact and forbearance will have to be shown by its leading personalities if serious dissensions are to be avoided. 7.

My Lord, With reference to my telegram No.108 of April 2nd, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith a translation of a press report on a meeting of the Chamber of Deputies at which the Prime Minister made a statement on the policy of his Cabinet* 2 Rashid Ali wisely refrained from drawing up a lengthy programme and was satisfied to declare his general adherence to the programme formulated by Nuri Said in March 1939 (see my d espa tch No. 131 of March 30th, 1939) and to real firm his predecessors declarations on foreign policy. 3. The one new feature was the undertaking to create a national financial reserve for use in emergency. This idea is credited to the new Ministerof Finance, Naji Suwaidi, wno is also popularly believed to desire to curtail expenditure on the army The debate on the Government^ programme afforded another opportunity which many Deputies took, to talk about the policy of the Allies in Palestine and Syria and certain Members also raised the question of Iraq's right to take part in peace negotiations at the end of the war. From the Ministerial benches nothing was said on these two points, although of course the Iraqi Government have already recieved an assurance that they will have a voice in peace negotiations (see my despatch No. 554 of the 27th September last).

The meeting, which lasted for some three and half hours, was devoted to the discussion of the Governments programme* This was read by the Prime Minister and was as follows:- Our Cabinet has shouldered the burden of responsibility trusting in God and in the confidence of His Highness the Regent and of the members of this House. Relying on the cooperation of the Iraqi people in these difficult times it will undertake whatever the progress of the country demands in any sphere. 'The lines of policy to he followed hy the Cabinet do not differ from those -generally followed hy previous Cabinets, in particular hy the Saidi Cabinet the majority of whose members are included in the present Cabinet. The latter’s programme, which was endorsed by the House, deals with the country’s most pressing needs and we see therefore no necessity for repeating it here where deeds, not ornate phraseology and wordy repetition expected of us, deeds which rouse the country to take action where its needs are vital. We cannot but reaffirm, however, that our first duty as regards foreign policy must be:- (X) To strengthen the foundations of Arab Alliance and to continue to work for the realization of the aspirations of other neighbouring Arab countries, whose ties with Irao anc Arab States and whose need for independence and freedom should be the mutual aim of them all. This aim is a complement to Irak’s foreign policy as appli ed to the obligations and promises contracted by the Allies and the aims announced by them. (2) TO mm «. obligations of „ a allWa h Great Britain on the basis of mutual interest and / exchangeexchange of benefits# (3) To strengthen the bonds of friendship and collaboration with the Saadabad Powers# (4) To maintain friendly relations with all other friendly nations# 'As regards internal policy, greater attention is to be paid to the spread of a spirit of security and tranquillity in the country, and to the protection of personal freedom by. ensuring respect of the Constitution and other laws as being above all other considerations. 'As regards Finance: the Government will endeavour to curtail unnecessary expenditure and to postpone expenditure on schemes capable of postponement until after the present crisis thereby enabling the Government to save and to create a reserve to meet the crisis which must at all times be reckoned with.' The debate on the statement was opened by Saiyid Abdul Mahdi with a lengthy speech in which he held in review the 19 ✓ similar past Cabinet programmes which, he said, were almost alike in their attractive contents, but were never carried into practical effect expect in a very small measure, owing to the weakness shorn by successive Iraqi Parliaments in the exercise of their constitutional rights# In the latter part of his lengthy speech, Deputy Saiyid Abdul Mahdi referred to Syria and Palestine and the acts of hanging, pillage and banishment taking place in that country and, after referring to the unfulfilled pledges made to Arabs by the Allies in the 1914 war, he said:- 'When in 1916 the Allies found themselves in pressing need for the support of the Arabs they promised the latter fulfilment of their claims. The Allies* need for Arab support at the present moment is stronger than it was in 1916. I hope that the burning Palestinian question will be given due consideration by our Great Ally, as I also hope that those in places of responsibility, with the people behind them, will do all they can /toto secure a fair and just solution for the Palestine proDleIn• ,, Deputy Saiyid Izzud-Din al Naqih spoke next expressing gratification with the Cabinet f s programme. Deputy Saiyid Baqir al Shabibi, after declaring that the Cabinet^ programme was an important one, though somewhat ambiguous, asked whether the Prime Minister following the example of the Egyptian Wafd Party would elucidate the attitude of the Allies in regard to their participation in the peace negotiations | as an allied country. The Minister of Finance Naji al Suwaidi spoke at some length in reply to the foregoing Deputies, but evaded answering the points which had been raised concerning Syria and Palestine and the elucidation of the attitude of the Allies in regard to Iraq/s participation in the peace negotiations at the close of the war. Deputy Shaikh Zamil al Manna* spoke next expressing confidence in the Cabinet and alluding to the Arab Revolt and the Iraqi insurrection and the efforts exerted by the Arabs for the realisation of their national aspirations. Deputy Saiyid Abbud al Haimas thanked the Government for their national policy as indicated by their programme and a§ced that negotiations should be entered into quickly with the Allies concerning Palestine and Syria. He expressed the hope that the Allies would recover their better senses and concede to the Arab peoples their rights. Deputy Shaikh Fariq al Mizhir expressed gratification with the Cabinet programme as being calculated to satisfy the people’s aspirations. Deputy Saiyid Ibrahim Attar Bashi remarked that though short the Cabinet programme contained all that was essential, and expressed the hope that the Cabinet would succeed in delivering Arab countries from the foreign yoke.The debate concluded by the Prime Minister who thanked the Deputies for their remarks which he said contained so much wise advice and counsel. He emphasised his resolve together with the other members of the Cabinet to act upon their declared policy and to see that justice was evenly distributed. He explained that while strict economy in state expenditure would be observed, expenditure on economic development and health and education will not be curtailed. The Cabinet programme was then adopted, the decision of the House being received with general applause.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE IRAQ. CONFIDENTIAL. MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Section 1. [E 1638/448/93] Copy No* J fj Sir B. Newton to Viscount Halifax.—(Received April 12.) (No. 140.) My Lord. Bagdad. April 1, 1940. I HAVE the honour to inform you that a discussion on the internal situation in this country took place in the Chamber of Deputies on the 24th March during the course of the budget debate. The speakers devoted their remarks mainly to the question of stability, a matter which, as your Lordship is aware, has with good reason occupied the attention of both politicians and the public in Iraq during recent years. 2. I he Prime Minister himself made a short but vigorous speech in which he emphasised the point that stable conditions could not be secured by drastic measures or the use of brute force, they could only be realised, he said, by the careful treatment of administrative and constitutional problems in the light of reason and justice. He thought that an outstanding defect in the Constitution was the powers that it gave for the pardoning of those convicted of political crime. He i emmded the Chamber that it was the intention of the Government to introduce certain amendments to the Organic Law, and these amendments would include provisions that would ensure that political criminals suffered the just punishment of their crimes. 3. 1 he Minister of Defence, who also spoke, challenged the statements made b\ certain Deputies that stability was entirely absent from politics in Iraq. He pointed out that political incidents were common in most countries, in many countries, indeed, they were a more frequent and more disturbing feature of political life than they were in Iraq, and by comparison Iraq could show a record of government of which her people need not be ashamed. The Government was he said, determined to keep the army out of politics. 4. Many Deputies paid tribute to the work achieved by the late Minister of h mance. They deplored the loss which the country had suffered by his death, and from this theme passed to a denunciation of those responsible for the succession of stormy events which had destroyed the peace of Iraq during the past few years. Abdul Mahdi, a Shiah Deputy for the Euphrates, attributed these events to the spirit of greed which had entered into their hearts, and he declared that Bagdad had become a centre for plotting and political conspiracv. The most deplorable feature of the history of recent years had. he said, been that the laws of the country had been violated by the very leaders to whom the people had entrusted the defence of the law and the maintenance of the Constitution. 5. Others referred to the Prime Minister’s plan to establish stability through amendments to the Constitution. Few thought that this plan would be effective and most pointed out that the problem which confronted them was not one that could be resolved by legislation as it had its roots in the weaknesses of character of the leaders of the country. What was needed was the suppression of political charlatanism. Several Deputies declared that the whop nalionwas gravely dissatisfied with the conduct of the political leaders in whom all faith had been lost. If the present state of affairs represented the fruits of democratic government then it was time, they said, that some other form of government was put in its place. 6.

It contains correspondence and memoranda regarding relations between HMG and the Government of Iraq, and documents the reaction of the India Office and Foreign Office to political developments within Iraq. The papers primarily consist of communications between HM Ambassador to Iraq and HM Foreign Secretary, regarding the cabinet of Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, his resignation in January 1941 and the formation of a new cabinet under Taha al-Hashimi, and the resumption of power by Rashid Ali backed by the military in April 1941.
