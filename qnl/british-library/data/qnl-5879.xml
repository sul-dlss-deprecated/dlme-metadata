I also intimated that, as the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was in Baghdad and was due to visit Kuwait in the near future, I should welcome a further discus sion wi^b the advisers and heads o + ' the Iraqi Government departments concerned with a view, to profit by Golonel How 1 e ’ s pr e s e n ce . p.

It was made clear during this discussion f hat while His Majesty’s Government, ^hrough Colonel Yowle, would urge the Shaikh strongly in th= sense suggested, they could go no further than this and were not in a ■oosition to force him to take any course of action against his will. 5. In order to regularise the nosition, Colonel Yowle asked for and was given a letter authorising him to proceed in accordance with the instructions contained in the India Office telegram under reference. 6.

My dear Minister, Your Excellency is no doubt aware that towards the end of last year, His Excellency Hurl Pasha suggested to Sir Francis Humphrys that His Majesty’s government in the United Kingdom should be requested, as protectors of Kuwait, to examine the possibility of making appropriate representations to the Ruler of Kuwait with a view to enlist his co-operation in an effort to put an end to the smuggling of certain commodities into Iraq. Fur some two years the Iraqi Govern ment had endeavoured unsuccessfully to reach agreement with the Shaikh on this matter. 2* Sir Francis Humphrys acted promptly on Uuri Pasha’s suggestion and for the past few months the question of smuggl ing from Kuwait has formed the subject of most earnest consideration, not only by His Majesty’s Government but also by His Majesty’s Embassy in discussion with the heads ane advisers of the competent departments of the Iraqi Government and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 3. I now have pleasure in informing Your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their good offices and to urge the Shaikh strongly to accept a solution of the present difficulties on bases approximating to those which emerged from the discussions mentioned above. 4. These bases may be briefly and generally summarised as follows:- (1) The appointment of a British Customs Director at Kuwait with special powers (not excluding the possibility of restricting the impact of certain^ommodities), who would work inclose liaison with the Iraqi Customs authorities and the Political Agent at Kuwait. (2) The co-operation of the Shaikh of Kuwait in making effective / His Excellency Yasin Pasha al Hasimi, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bagdad.effective a frontier control and customs cordon system to bo set up by the Iraqi Government, 5, In order that the problem may be adequately considered in all its aspects, and details worked out with a view to arrive at a satisfactory solution to all concerned, His Majesty's Government propose that a conference, presided over by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, be called at a very early date at some convenient place at which the Iraqi Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait would be represented. 6, If the Iraqi Government are in general agreement with this proposal and are prepared nou to Insist on any particj—ar solution pending the result of the conference, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (who is at present in Bagdad and will leave on May 25th) willmake the necessary representa tions to the Shaikh of Kuwait in the very near future. 7, The Political Resident will be available to preside ove.x tuch a conference at some time between June 9th and eune 16th next, 8, I shall be glad to learn as soon as possible whether Your Excellency agrees to this proposed- procedure. I avail myself of this opportunity to express to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.

I have gone into question again in the light Shaikh’s attitude and should (be) glad if you would take into account following consider at ions:- (a) We do not admit validity Shaikh’s arguments as regards Director Customs and he appears to be confusing smuggling with legitimate trade. Moreover (b) While Shaikh rejeets H.M.G-’s strong advice and says that he is prepared face blockade by IRAQ, he somewhat inconsistently looks to H.M.G. to lirait blockade in respect certain matters id eat his dates produced in Iraq and water supply. 2nd Part . Though presumably strict blockade contemplated by IRAQ Government primarily means , prohi- } bit ion of imports from Kuwait, they have A also contemplated cutting off water supply/ (see Baghdad telegram of Eebruary 19th No.47). H.M.G. are unable guarantee that such a step would be held to ex:cede Iraq Government’s legal rights, though on grounds humanity alone we should of course seek to dissuade them from tak&amp;ng it. In any case prospects Iraq seeking to apply such extreme measures of coersion seem apart from other considerations to make it impossible for H.M.G. to wash their hands of dispute, and Shaikh’s request that we should secure immunity of water supply and date gardens produced in Iraq affords good ground for urging him afresh to reconsider his &lt;r*his intransigent attitude. (c) Prospect moreover that H.M.G. could if an extreme strain is placed on Kuwait Iraq relations succeed obtaining satisfaction over ownership date gardens would almost vanish. While this and smuggling problem are distinct in theory, Iraq Government are unlikely keep them separate in practice, and final failure over date gardens would be both expensive to H.M.G. and damaging to them in the Persian Gulf. 5rd Part . (d) H.M.G. have in all discussions given full weight to arguments advanced by you and Govt, of India against direct intervention. They quite agree that it may be possible let matters take their course for some little time, but they remain of opinion that inter vention will be necessary sooner or later, if (as is essential) they are to maintain their control of Kuwait relations with her neighbours and avoid.odium of failure to prote ct her , which would inevitably fall back on H.M.G,, despite any disclaimer of res ponsibility. It has be aa for this reason that they have been so anxious for equitable via Media, (e) If IRiiQ, is now allowed to apply sanctions it will be quite impossible in practice for H.M.G. to xssxs insure these are kept within legitimate limits or to secu.re any real satis Action from Iraq if they are not. That cannot fail do us damage locally. 4th Part . (f) Moreover if sanctions are sufficiently effective to make Shaikh sue for terms there can be no question that terms asked by Iraq will be far more severe than at present. (g) You will apart frcm this appreciate that if serious situation develops later, and Shaikh then asks our support H.M.G. might well be reluctant risk grave breach with Iraq, in which their interests are so great, merely in order extricate Shaikh from difficulty of his own making which can be avoided by him adopting a less intransigent attitude now. 3. If in the light above and in particular para 2(b) you are prepared approach Shaikh further we should welcome it, and trust you will do all in your power make him sea reason. 5th Part . 4. Since above was written I have seen Baghdad / telegram dated June 22nd No. 169, addressed to F.O. i LondonLondon - If Shaikh really proposes to leave for Baghdad on June 24th, notwithstanding advice to the contrary, which you instructed Political .agent to give him, in and if you decide that he should be approached on above lines, you will no doubt consider desirability of instructing Dickson to make further attempt dissuade him from going to Baghdad at once, or if this fails accompanying hi:i to Baghdad, and to make further ajbpeal to him, before any conmunication is made Iraq Governmoit by Clark Kerr. paragraph 5 of your telegram dated June -RETAXANDDM-Telegram I.F.O. 19 27 *rom To Resident, Bushire Political, Kuwait No 554 Dated and reed® 23rd June 19 55® .

(c) Regarding smuggling - He asks that H.M.G, hold up final orders re Blockade to Ambassador till he arrives London 4th July, when he requests early interview with India Office,and will give his final reply whether he accepts the Blockade (as he has already said he would) or can satis fy IRAQ, by some counter offer.

Sir, ; , ■ With reference to my despatch No.294 of May 28th last, I have t'he honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a letter from the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to my First Secretary in which he confirms the acquiescence of the Iraqi Government in the proposals put forward by His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom for a conference to discuss the question of smuggling from Kuwait into Iraq. 2. You will observe that the Iraqi Government see no objection to the conference being held at Kuwait. 3. Yasin Pasha’s mention to the 'third clause” concerning a joint Iraq-Kuwaiti preventive service is really a reference to paragraph 4 of your telegram No.147. The representatives of the Iraqi Customs, who were present at the meeting at this Embassy on May 24th, showed a disposition to regard this service as a crucial matter for discussion at the proposed eomerence. Reference to it had purposely been omitted in my letter to Yasin Pasha of May 23rd, but in view of the attitude of the Director- General of Customs Mr.Bateman thought it advisable to read aloud paragraph 4 of your telegram in extenso , so as to leave the Iraqi representatives in no doubt as to the way in wnich their proposals on this subject were regarded by His Majesty s Govern ment. In reply, Yasin Pasha pointed out good humouredly, that if the Iraqi Government are to reimburse the Shaikh as has been suggested, the Shaikh for his part should be asked at least to go / he Right Hon’ble Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc », etc•- 2 - go through the motions of setting upj his own force to cooperate with the Iraqis. In practice it would not matter if his force numbered no more than a M faraslf’or two, so long as there was the facade of a Kuwaiti preventive service . The reasons for this were made clear in paragraph 12 of my despatch No.198 of April lath last. 4. It seems fairly clear that the Iraqi Government are prepared to go to the proposed conference with open minds and that they ask no more than that the other participants should do the same , 6. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of India, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (sgd.) Archibald Clark Kerr.Copy. No.C/1204. Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Bagdad, 30th May 1935. Dear Mr •Bateman, Reference your letter No.264 dated 23rd May, 1935, regarding measures for the suppression of smuggling from Kuwait, and the conversations which has taken place at the Embassy in the presence of representatives on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, and of Colonel Fowle. The Iraqi Government agree in principle to the meeting being held and to discussions taking place on the bases outlined in your letter under reference. They do not, however, wish to bind themselves beforehand not to discuss the third clause relating to the adoption of common preven tive measures, discussed in the course of the conversation referred to above, since the negotiators may possibly be able kK at the forthcoming meeting to arrive at some other oases for common measures better fitted to secure the desired purpose, to replace those mentioned in the third, clause in question. The Iraqi Government can see no objection to the conference being held at Kuwait on the date stated in your above mentioned letter.

The Iraqi Government did not in the least wish to oblige the Sheikh of Koweit to take any particular measures, though they greatly resented the support which they were convinced that he was secretly giving to the mmggllng organisations* /ill that they wanted was to have a free hand to deal with the smuggling in their own way. Recently m incident had occurred where mm smugglers had been killed and the Iraqi® had been accused of violating Kowelti territory* This wee not the case, and the Iraqi Government had offered to send, a British official down to verify the facts, but the proposal had not been accepted* 8* I told Surl Paaha that X could not accept his statement regarding the Sheikh of Koweit 1 a interest in the MtsskggXtug* Qmr information was that the smn&amp;gllng was organised by an Iraqi organisation in Basra* The Iraqi Government wore of course perfectly free to take any measures they liked on their own territory to deal with the smuggling, but they had been represented to us as wishing to go very much further, and Hurl himself had implied that K owe it had been behaving very badly* This seemed to show a misapprehension of, the legs! position* The problem was constantly arising of smuggling into a State with high tariffs through a neighbouring state with low tariffs* In suchBUQh cases there wm absolutely no legal obligation nwUr international lm for the state with the low tariff to take any Manures to prevent smuggling. The ease situation had arisen during the prohibition regime in the United. State® when British territory had been used a© a base for liquor smuggling. Hi© Majesty’s Soyerimmt had then be® under no legal obligation to take special measures merely to enable the United States to enforce their own. internal legislation. 3. But while this might be the legal position, it was clearly desirable to arrive at some arrangement» and, just a© Hi© Majesty 1 © Government had come to an agreement with the United State© Government with a view to securing a reasonable measure of co-operation in preventing liquor smuggling 9 -so we had been trying to devise some system by which Koweit might co-operate to a reasonable extent with Iraq with a view to preventing the smuggling trade. 4. The difficulty was that the only absolutely effective method of doing this would be to raise the Stoweiti tariffs (Kurt immediately agreed, on this point). But this was impracticable - firstly because the Koweiti tariff© were limited by treaty, and secondly because the only effect would be an immense rise of prices in Koweit, and the Koweiti administration could hardly be expected to face the unpopularity and odium which this would involve merely in order to enable a neighbouring country to carry out its own tariff legislation. X felt# however, fairly hopeful that the local conference now about to open to discuss this question might find acme solution. fe had ourselves suggested various methods, such as a. system of manifests, trade control posts# the appointment of • British Director of Custom® at Koweit, etc., and X felt that there was thereforetherefore a reasonable hope of a satisfactory settlement being reached* 5. mirl Pasha said that, if so, this would be meet satisfactory* All that Iraq had really wanted hitherto mm a free hand to deal with the smuggling in their own way. But if the smuggling could be eliminated by agreement so much the better. Hitherto it had been most difficult \ to deal with the question in view of the support which the Sheikh bad apparently been receiving from Hi® Majesty* s Governusent* 6 * I tried to disabuse Hurl Pasha of the idea that we were taking sides in the dispute, and I repeated my statement of the legal position os described above; but we agreed that no further action ms called for until the results of the impending conference were known.

'Violation of Kuwait Territorial Waters hy Iraq Customs Launch'. With reference to my telegram No. 239 dated the 25th July 1935, I baye the honour to enclose for your information (a) translation of letter No.R-4/2114 dated 24th July 1935 from the Deputy Ruler of Kuwait. (b) Testimony of Ibrahim al Faudari, the Kuwait light keeper in Mascban Island given to myself. 2. Both documents speak for themselves and my only regret is that the other three occasions (men tioned by the light keeper in para 2 of his testimony) * on which the IRAQ Customs launch was seen operating round Mas chan Island In June last were not reported at the time, so that I could have taken them up officially. 3. As I have had occasion to N remark in earlier 3~o S'-yS despatches dealing with similar hL&amp;UL- operations of the IRAQ Customs launch in Kuwait waters and more especiallyespecially in the 'narrows' between Maschan Island and the Subiyeh promontory, owners of Kuwait water and other boats plying between Kuwait and Fao , who have bad their launches held up and searched, will always refuse to give any evidence against the IRAQ Customs iJXMEJck authorities for fear of reprisals at the ^ao end, where It will soon be Known who gave the show away. Hence no reports have come in or have been furnished by actual owners of boats of the incidents complained of. Nor in the present case would the story of the visit of the Customs launch on the 9th July have come to light, I think, had not His Excellency Shaikh Abdulla As Salim, the Deputy Ruler, himself visited Falaika Island on 20th July and Maschan on 21st July - It was while there that he learned of the visits of the IRAQ launch on 9th July, as well as of the other three visits in June, 5, On his return to Kuwait, His Excellency came personally to the Agency and reported the matter, but as he rightly put it, the June incidents had happened so long ago that it would only make Kuwait look ridi culous if he were to take them up now, hence he pro posed protesting officially only in respect of the 9th July visit of the IRAQ Launch. 6 . You are aware of course that the Islands of Falaika, Maschan and Bubiyan all belong to Kuwait and if you will examine the sketch map which I enclose and which is drawn to scale, you will see that the follow ing points undoubtedly fall within Kuwait’s territorial waters limit;- lai•“ 3 ** (a) KJior Sublyeh, throughout its length, (b) The channel between Subiyeh Point (note the position of low water) and Mas chan Island, (o) The channel between Palaika Island and Mas chan Island. 7 * After all the correspondence which took place over exactly similar violations of Kuwait waters previously (see this office letter Nos, 245 and G—182 dated the 11th October 1933 and 18th May 1934 respec tively and connected letters). It comes as a distinct shook to l^stfn that IRAq Customs officials^leamed nothing and are apparently starting their old tactics again. ! 8 , In this connection it is of added interest ■to perasa the 5th to 8th line of para 4 of Foreign i Office Note of 1st July 19S5 describing a talk, which Mr. Heads1 had in London with His Sxcellenoy Nuri Pasha on the subject of Kuwait smuggling and which was for warded under your Printed Letter No. 536-S dated the 30th July 1935. 9 # It will be noted that I have only sent you the testimony of the man Ibrahim al j audari * The » evidence of the other witnesses (mentioned by Shaikh Abdulla and the light keeper himself) being exactly the same as that of the light keeper, I did not think it worth while to record. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd. H.R.P. DICKSON. Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the S.N.O. Persian Gulf, H.M.S. Bideford.Translation of a latter No*R-4/2114, dated the 22nd Rabi’ Than! 1354, eorresponding to the 24th July 1935, from His Exealiensy the Deputy Ruler of Kuwait, to the Politieal Agent, Kuwait. After somplimen ts, With reference to the verbal eonversation I had with you yesterday, regarding the 'Black* Fao customs launch, I now confirm that according to the evidence given by the witnesses whose names are mentioned at the foot of this letter, the said launch had on several occasions recently visited Mas chan island, the last occasion being on Tuesday the 7th Rabi* Than! 1354 (9th July 1935). On that day the launch came oftt from the n Khor Sabbiyeh', and when it reached the 'Mafrass* (the centre or the deep water channel in the shallow water between between Mas chan and S&amp;bblyeh, along which the sailing ships can pass), it seized a sailing ship bound for Basra (Fao) and released it after a while. The lameh then cast anchor in the centre of^Mafrass 1 (deep water channel) near the rt Yahi' on the north side of Mas chan till 6 o’clock Arabic time (1 P.M.). Then it moved westward, and came close in to M&amp;sehan island, to a distance od about a quarter of a mile or less, and cast anfchor there. At about 8 o’clock Arabic time (3 P.M.) the launch noticed a sailing ship coming from Kuwait, and followed it up to the *Mafrass tt . There the sailing ship cast anchor and the launch tied up to it. At 10 o’cloek Arable time (5 P.M.) a small 'balam* belonging to the man in charge of the Maschan light appeared coming from Kuwait. The launch detached from the sailing ship and followed the said Mas chan 'baHam'. But as it came closer to it near the shore and saw that it carried nothing but a supply of water, the launch gave up the chase and proceeded to antoher sailing ship that was coming from Kuwait, again fastened to it^ a little while, and then let it go. The launch/The launeh then returned to the first sailing ship at about simset, (whieh had not evidently been allowed to depart)* At 2 o’eloeh Arabi® time at night (9 F.M.} the launeh sailed right round Masehan proeeeding in a westwardly direetion in the first plaee, till it returned to her start ing point near where the held up sailing ship was, and east amehor there about 4 o’eloek Arable time at night (11 P.M.}. After that time both the launoh and the sailing ship left. I have therefore ordered Ibrahim al-Faudari to report to you so that you may take his evidenee. He is the man who lives on Mas®hen island, and is one of the witnesses who saw the launeh* The remaining witnesses will if neeessary be sent to you at onee* Please note ear©fully the ease and refer it to the authorities eoneerned as early as possible in order to prevent the said Istmeh from infringing the territorial waters of Kuwait* I am afraid sueh notion on the part of Fao eustoms launeh will give rise to misunderstanding owing to its frequent wanderings and repeated interference with the sailing ships near eoasts where it has no right to interfere with anyone at all* Usual ending.

(4) Ghulam bin Hydar.4 ./ The evidence of Ibrahim bin ’Abdulla al-I&amp;u&amp;ari, the man in charge of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s light at Masehan island, given before H.B.M’s Political Agent at Kuwait. I live with my family on the Maseh&amp;n island, having been appointed by His Izoelleney the Ruler of Kuwait to look after the 'beaeon' set up there for the use of sailing ships using the Masehan-Sabbiyeh channel. In my spare time I do some 'fishing' from the island. Besides my family I have got with me on the island four assistant fishermen. We make the whole population of that small island. 2. On the morning of Tuesday the 7th Rabi* Than! 1354 (9th July 1935) at about 2 o’clock Arabic time (9 A.M.) as we were starting out on our daily work of attending the fish trpps we noticed the Fao customs launch known as the 'M0tor al-Aswad' (the black launch) coming out of the Khur Sabbiyeh and approaching our island. It was the same 'black launch' which we have in the past noticed visiting our waters bet- lately ween Mas chan and Sabbiyeh, and which as recently as last &gt;rte&amp;. * 4 month (June) we saw on three occasions. 3. On this occasion the launch approahed to within 500 yards of our island, and when it reached the 'Yahi' (a signpost is tailed on some roeks to warm sailing ships of the danger) it held up a 'balam' proceeding from Kuwait to Fao and boarded it. The launch tied up alongside the 'balam' in question, and remained with it for about 15 minutes. Leaving the said 'balam' the launch next east anchor in the channel usually followed by sailing ships, which lies between Mas chan island and the promontory of Sabbiyeh (mainland) - though nearer to the former. It remained in that position till 6 o’clock Arabic time (1 P. M.) when it weighed anchor and moving in a semi-circle round Masehan to a point lying west of it, cast anchor close in shore“* S '■* 4. After 2 hours at 8 o’^loak Arabi® time (3 P. M.}, aotleimg another sailing boat eoming from Kuwait, the launeh again weighed anehor and made for it (the boat) so as to eut it off* It eaught up with it near the 'Yahi', foreed it to aaehor, and tied up alongside for about 2 hours. Both launoh and ’’balam' remained at anehor. 5. At 10 o’eleek Arabia time (5. P.M.) my own small 'balam' used for eonveying fish to Kuwait, arrived baek from Kuwait with our supply of water ete. The launeh to start with followed it for a short distanee and then altered sourse and made for another larger ”dhow w which was also seen to be coming from Kuwait. On coming alongside the launch only remained with it for a few minutes. 6 . On leaving this last w baiam', the launch once again returned to its first position near the 'Yahi' whin’® it tied up alongside the 'balam'(mentioned in para 3 above) whieh was still anchored there, and had been apparently forbidden to proceed. 7. Some 2 hours after sunset (i.e.QP.M,) the launeh still clearly visible detached itself from the said n balam rt and once again turned in a wide circle, round the west site of Mas chan island, and passing through 'Wakur' (i.e. the channel between Mashhan and F&amp;ilika islands) came to the sam© position which it started from i.e. near the ”Yahi' and again tied up to the same 'balam' (para 3 &amp; 6) whieh was still anchored there. Bothjrf the launeh and the 'bal&amp;m' were clearly seen by us in the moonlight till 4 o f eloek Arable time (11 P.M.). After that we turned in for sleep. In the morning they were not visible and must have sailed away with the good shamal breeze whieh starting blowing that night. 8 .

I did not feel able to press the Minister for Foreign Affairs to recommend the acceptance of the Shaikh’s proposals for the following reasons: (i) Similar proposals were rejected by British advisers in February last for g od reasons (see Sir Francis Humphrys 1 telegram No. 47).

After leaving Kuwait on the morning of the 28th July I reached Basra safely at about 9 A,M, and took the mail train for Kerbella the sams evening, I visited the shrines in Kerbella in the morning next day and proceeded by car to Nejef in the evening, I passed the night in Nejef and visited Koofa also. Next day morning I came back to Kerbella and after a stay of 2 hours I travelled by car to Baghdad reaching the latter place at 11 A.M, I utilized every minute that I had at my disposal and went round Baghdad seeing almost all important places. I left Baghdad on the 31st and arrived Basra on the 1st. During my short stay in Iraq I am glad I saw many things and I met many people. You will be interested to hear that it is not only the high authority and officials who accuse Kuwait of snuggling etc. but it appears to be a general belief throughout Iraq. Almost everyone I met asked me many questions about the smuggling which they believed to be going on from Kuwait to Iraq on a large scale. They were probably given to understand that almost every imp thing imported into iraq comes through Kuwait only. As much as it was possible for me to say I explained the things to the enquirers and told them that Kuwait was quite innocent in this affair as she took no part nor took any shares in the profits made by smugglers. They could blame their own people who found it a profitable business to bring things from outside Iraq. Kuwaitis were engaged in a legitimate trade and they sold their things to those who came to buy it. They also said that during the recent tribal troubles Kuwait did not play a fair game and supplied arms and anmunitions to the rebels. I told them that it was a news for me as I never heard of such things as arms and ammunition to be available in Kuwait for the purpose of sale, and there was strict embargo on importation of arms into that State and the Ruler shaved his good regard for his neighbour State Iraq by allowing none to take out any kind of arms from Kuwait. It was very unkind of Iraqis to misjudge Kuwait in that respect. Murid Husain, an Indian who has lately been n naturalized Iraqi and is now Stationmaster at Kerbella told me that it was a general belief that there was a hand of British Government in the recent troubles and that all the arms supplied to the tribesmen came from England and through Kuwait only. He said that most think that unless they have their own control in Kuwait they shall never be able to live in peace. This is the essence of the talks I had with several people in Kerbella Nejef and Baghdad. While passing in front of the Persian Consulate at Baghdad I noticed that there was a crowd in the yard and to see what was happening inside I went in. I found that people had come there to take out the Persian nationality papers. I learnt that those Persinas who had adopted Iraqi nationality to escape from the law of conscription in Persia were return ing tto Persian nationality to avoid the enlistment in the Iraq defence force under the Conscription law passed by the Iraq Government recently. In eonclusio]In conclusion I beg to avail myself of this opportunity to thank you, Sir, for all your kindness you showed during my short stay in Kuwait and beg to be excused for anything that may have not pleased you.

( 1 ) SIR LFOFAIiD 'WAiCBIiY expressed to His Excellency me pleasure of those present at having an oppox buni 03/ or. meeting him. After some preliminary discussion, in the course of which the Sheikh intimated that he had certain 0bner questions to raise be.siQ.es une quescion Oj- tne mricigglin^, Sheikh asked what exactly it was the Iraq Government required or Ho we it in rno mar g ex 0 x. sidU^^lingj • MEi. HBHDBL explained that the Iraq Government were determined to stop the smuggling no matter what methods they had to employ and had threatened to take severe measures against Ko we it ii no other solution were po o©x. dj. ^. H.lvi.or., on the other hand, were anxious to help Koweit to reach an amicable settlement. H.M.G. had had long experience in dealing with similar questions, and lie instanced the case of illegal smuggling into the U.S.A. as a case where one country (H.M.G.) had agreed to help another country (the U.S.A,) to stop smuggling by instituting a system of manifests ana bya' lowing British vessels to be sear diea xor contraband outsine ^2. eric an territorial w a ter s^ a 1 di o u^, h H • ^ , o-ine Ko wo j. u, - i u. n been under no legal obligation to do so. 'The friendly attitude adopted by K.M.G-. had been much appreciated oy trie U. S .Government and had had a generally beneficial efxect on the relations between them and H.M.G. 'What H.M.G. suggested was that His nxeelleucy should follow their example in this case, and ocme an ccj_uala.y broad and farsighted point of view, and that lie should in his own interests cooperate witn iraQ. ratner than rusn into a qaaiiel which might have much more serious consequences ulian w-ei e nopai e^v at present. They did not suggest that the Sheikh should give up my of his rights or independence, but that he should take certain steps voluntarily. He Quite realised tnat any measures oaken yy His Excellency to check smuggling would involve financial losses • o his people, but it was better to cooperate vim Xiao in suppressing smuggling and thus preserve legitimate trade ramei man be subjected to an Iraqi blockade whicn would puo an eud io all trace ox any kino.. MR. LAI Tin hil TB said that it was understood that the Sheikh lad intimated, to Colonel Dickson, at his last interview before .caving Koweit, that he had certain counter proposals to make on. mis subject and H.M.G. would be interested to know what these were. HhtB SHEIKH OF K- 0 HSI 1 sa id that there was really no analogy &gt;e.tween the position of Koweit and the question ox illegal smuggling into the U.S.A. mentioned, by Mr. Rend el. Koweit had 10 cultivation nor industry, nor anything else to provide a living ;or her people except the trade which she was at present able to jarry on. King Abdul Asiz had stopped smuggling across his borders lirnself and Persia had also taken certain measures, and so could die Iraq Government if they wanted to do so. It was impossible :or His Excellency himself to do it for them, and ne did not see diy he should accept a responsibility whicn was really uiieirs.MR.. HBInDEL Sciio. til at Xi*8»ci co uld Gui pxQi/t-. the g-uo-o-iinp', but that if the Iraq Governnient did this in their ovm way and tool: similar measures to those taken by King Abdul Asia, it would be very serious for Koweit. fJih Sci^ d that he was quite prepared to accept what the Saudis had done. He was also prepared to help the Iraq Government against smuggling oy sea oy ins g i g uoing a mau-i-s-eoc oj stem^ u land the Iraq Government must take their own measures. MR . LAIIHhAITBi said that His Excellency T s oiler to institute a system of manifests by sea was much appreciated. Ihe Iraq Government had however emphasised that their real difficulties were by land. He asked whether His excellency might not be prepared also to institute a manifest system by land as well as by sea ? on the assumption that the Iraq Government on their side would establish, say, four Iraqi Customs posts on the frontier through which trade could be canalised. He emphasised that the india Office were most anxious, to safeguard Koweit in this matter. IHS SHEIKH pointed out that the difficulty on land was that Koweit supplied goods to several countries and that there were several routes leading from Koweit. If a man wished to take goods to Iraq he might say that he was going not to Iraq but, for example, to Syria, ana it was quite impossible to say whether he was telling the truth or not. Iff!. tatthwaxts/MR. LAITHWAITE said that a person leaving Koweit by land would have to pass either through' Saudi Arabia or Iraq. Saudi Arabia was not at the moment in question. Under the manifest system suggested a person would be required, if he went to Iraq, to cross the frontier at one of the four Customs posts, to have with him a manifest for any dutiable goods which he carried and to pay the appropriate duty to Iraq whether his ultimate destination was Syria or not. The SheiAh’s responsibility would have been discharged by the issue of the manifest. THE SHEIKH said that in that case he was quite willing to give manifests to all those who passed out of Koweit en route to Iraq. The manifest would state the quantities of the goods carried, but would not mention the route to be travelled, or the point at which the frontier would be crossed, since the Koweit authorities could not be responsible for the actual route tnat tne man might take.. ' His Excellency agreed, however, with a suggestion by Mr.Ward that the manifest might also state that it was given ”for Iraq', but he said he knew that no one going to Iraq would ever tell the truth as to his destination, or take out a manifest, since llttre or no profit could be made if customs duty had to oe paid at the Iraq frontier. his Excellency agreed, however that if any man were caught by the Iraq autnorities carrying goods without a manifest, the man himself would be held responsible and would have to take the consequenc es. MR. LAITHWAITB said that an arrangement such as that suggested by the Sheikh would be of great value, and that his/f?f 5. his offer of it vms much appreciated by H.M.G. MRo RBh'DBh agreed. He added that the details of the system would require working out and that it would hawe to be put to the Iraq Government. The idea was that there should be ; as it were^ gates in the Iraq frontier 5 for the passage of legitimate trade, and that any merchandise not going through these gates would be stopped by the Iraq authorities. It would be better to have a wall with gates than a wall without any opening at all. MR. LAITHWA 1 TS enquired whether His Excellency had any organised customs service at present which would be capable of issuing manifests. A responsible official would be necessary to issue manifests not only for Iraq but also for Saudi Arabia (if a solution of the question of the Saudi blockade were reached on the basis suggested by the Sheikh of Customs posts and manifests) and also, once the Kuwait Oil Company commenced operations, to deal with imports by it. His Excellency said that he already had at Koweit two special Customs officials, one for trade by sea and one for trade by land who worked under his direct control, and were persons of sufficient authority and standing to issue such manifests. MR. WALTON reverted to the question of the counter proposal which the Sheikh was said to have mentioned to Colonel Dickson at Koweit. H.M.G. had understood from the latter T s report that His Excellency in discussion of the matter in London might be able to make some counter offer as an alternative to the Iraqi intention to impose a blockade. His Excellency had now accepted Mr.Laithwarte’s uggusuion in rogarc vo mam lg Lac. he no c some further/ ■■■■MBvurthur proposal oi his own to make? THS SIIEIEH said that he had no further suggestions to make, hut that he was prepared to accept the manifest system if the Iraq Government wanted it. Colonel Dickson and Colonel Powle had referred to the appointment of a British Customs Director by H.M.G., for which he saw no necessity. MB. LAITHWAITB suggested that if Koweit had a British Customs Director it would be easier to work with the Iraq Government, who had British Customs experts themselves, and easier to convince the Iraqis that Koweit was really prepared to cooperate than if the Sheikh only had Customs officials with purely local experience. He emphasised that the Director would be the Sheikh’s servant, appointed not by H.M.G. but by His Excellency himself. H.M.G. in making this suggestion had been solely concerned with Koweit interests. MR. BEDDED added that the British Customs officials in Iraq had. been able to help Iraq trade a great deal. Several independent States, for example Siam, employed British officials and it would be no reflection on the Sheikh's independence if he did so. THE SHEIKH said that Koweit, which derived its Customs revenue from the trade at one port onljr, could not afford to pay for such a Customs Director, but MR.LAITHWAITE reminded His Excellency that Iraq had offered to pay the cost. His Excellency expressed his dislike of having at Koweit an official paid by the Iraq Government, but MR. LAITHWAITE said that though Iraq might provide the money, there would be no question but that the Director would be in His Excellency's own service and that he need not bo paid by the Iraq Government direct. The/7. Tho source of the payment need not 'be known. HIS EXCELLENCY then said that he would not mind paying the Director himself. It was not a question of money. vifhat he objected to was the proposal itself, and he did not see the necessity for it since smuggling could be stopped without it. The Iraq Government could take, the same measures themselves as Ibn Saud had done. MR. LAITEIaITH said that this might lead to very serious complications which H.M.G. were most anxious to avoid. H.M.G., however, much appreciated the suggestions which His Excellency had no?/ made for a settlement and as the Sheikh was reluctant to agree to the appointment of a British Customs Director, they would make a further attempt to reach a settlement with Iraq on the basis of those suggestions.ConildentiaXa (*)/ GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, IN, B % Tins is an ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to be treated, on receipt,' with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed, ' To save time and formalities it is worded and signed as if it had been m despatched,} To - H*:.**s CiiargO d 1 Affaires, ^Jagdad• from the olitical Agtti&amp;f Euwait, with the request that, if you see no objection, a protest may be made to the Iraq Oovenment* Secretary of State iior India, ^endon* ciovemirjent of India, ^iralaf X3C olitical ixgmntf Kuweit AT bS6-.. of 1935« No, 7th .a^ust Copy is enclosed of a letter fo#C-241 dated the 25tl'i July 93b sd* G* Loch, Li out •-€olone 1 • olitical Hesident in the Persian uul olitical Resident in the i erslan Gulf * (aT s.e.

(i.11/^/35) Sir, British Embassy, Bagdad• 20th august 1935. ■V With reference to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr’s Savingram No.21 of July 27th, I have the honour to inform you that the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs enquired on August 12th last whether I could tell him anything about the conversations which had taken place in London between the Shaikh of Kuwait and representatives of His Majesty’s Government on -the question I ^ T/ T ] of smuggling from Kuwait. 2. It appeared that Nuri Pasha had failed to inform the Council of Ministers in the sense of the memorandum of the Shaikh’s proposals which had been communicated to him by His Majesty's Ambassador on July 25th. This was in all probability due to the fact that, at that time, he was engaged almost exclusively on the preparation of the Iraqi case prior to the opening of the frontier negotiations at Tehran. I therefore handed a copy of the memorandum to Yasin Pasha and asked him to let me know as soon as possible how the proposals made by the Shaikh were regarded by the Iraqi Government. 3. On August 19th, His Excellency informed me that the matter was still under consideration by the Council of Ministers but that he did not think that their reaction wouxb be favourable. 4. Meanwhile, I had received from the Political Resident at Bushire a copy of Colonel Dickson’s report ITo.C/241 oi 3 Right Honourable Sir Samuel J.G.Hoare,Bt.,GCSI.,GBE., etc., etc., etc.July 25th concerning the alleged illegal operations of the Fao Customs launch. Articles had also appeared in some of the more irresponsible of the vernacular organs of the press making erroneous allusions to Colonel Fowle’s representations to thG#Shuikh of Kuwait on the question of smuggling and talking vaguely of a desire expressed by many Kuwaitis for the incorporation of Kuwait in Iraqi territory. 4. I drew His Excellency^ attention to these press articles and stressed the deplorable impression which they were bound to produce one of the newspapers t Yasin Pasha expressed annoyance and question has since been s uspendgq . 5. I enclose copy of a note which, at His Excellency’s request, has now been addressed to the Ministry of foreign Affairs on the alleged infringement ot Kuwaiti teriioorial v/aters by the Fao customs launch. 6. I feel bound to xroint out, however, that so long as Bubiyan and Warba islands are used as dumps and jumping-off grounds by smugglers, the temptation to the Iraqi customs to pass into the Khor Subiyeh and to hug the coast is almost irresistible. It was for this reason that the Iraqi Govern ment were willing to reimburse the Shaikh for any positive contribution that he might be willing to make towards the establishment of a preventive service. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of Inuia and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (sd.)

In corroboration of the observations made in this letter, a statement from the light keeper on l.laschan island is also enclosed herein. This statement was made to the Political Agent, who also was furnished with similar evidence from other witnesses. 3. The Ministry will no doubt agree that ii the enclose..: reports are found to be substantially true the rao v,us -o * launch acted improperly in delaying and searching craft within the limits of Kuwaiti territorial waters• 4. His Majesty's Embassy therefore have the honour to request that the alleged incidents form the subject oi care ful investigation and that meanwhile the customs olficers at Fao and Basra should be enjoined to confine their activities. within legitimate limits• His Majesty's Embassy avail themselves oi this opportunity to renew the expression oi their highest consideration. ritish Embassy, Bagd-d. 20th August 1935.Mi?

From personal knowledge of the Islands in question and a result of some quite recent visits 1 should much doubt if thing of the kind visualized by Mr, Bateman takes place, more ecially, as both Islands are entirely without a drop of fresh ier on them, and bubiyan in particular is a fearsome expanse of d and dreaded death trap in bummer. Anyone going in f©reforming ips n of ccntraband goods, and running them across to the Fao linsular would need some sort of organization and certainly a &gt;ply of drinking water on shore. In any case Ido not see that Iraq patrol boats can have r justification at all for entering a wholly Kuwait estuary £e the IChor Subiyeh, when the head waters namely the Khor Zubair s in their hands entirely, as well as the whole northern half of i Khor Abdulla from the junction of Khor Zubair with the Khor- 2 - Khor Abdalla out to tlie oj)eii sea. If these waters are properly patrolled nothing can get through. 5. From my experience, gained over a period of several years residence in Kuwait I should say that most of the contraband cargo that is run to the Fao peninsular from Kuwait by small sailing boat, ( and not much goes this way), goes direct and is landed at once either inside the iahatt al Arab, or on the Western side of the Fao peninsular and some miles up. 6. All that the smuggler needs is a moonless night and a good breeze, and he is at his destination in a matter of 4 to 5 hours, lands his cargo and is off again before dawn. 7 , If any dumps are formed at all which I have no evidence of, it is more likely they are on the Islands of Auha and Falaika (East end) , or in the villages a few miles south of Kuwait.

During this time he had an opportunity of meeting members of the Government and paid formal calls on the Irirne Minister and the Minister of Interior. A dinner party was given in bus honour by Yasin fasha on September 13th. 2. I gather that the smuggling question, as a subject of conversation, was pruposely exchewed during the visit. 3. prior to the Shaikhs arrival, I had pressed the Prime Minister to let me know how the Iraqi Government viewed the proposals which had emerged from the conferences in London. He had given me to understand that the Gounpil of Ministers had carefully considered these proposals but had reached the conclusion that no useful purpose would be served by further parley; and that the time had arrived for the Government to make their own dispositions with a view to curtail smuggling from Kuwait and, if possible, to end it altogether. 4. On September 11th, I received a note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the relevant portion of which reads as follows:- tight Honourable Sir Samuel Hoare, Bt., G.C.S.I., G.B.E., etc., etc., etc.- 2 - 'In viev^ of the continuance of, and increase in the smuggling from Kuwait, and. the evil effect which it has had andcontinues to have on the administration and finance of Iraq, it has been decided to carry out the measures referred to by the Ministry in their ncte ol August 10th and to initiate measures to combat the smuggling forthwith, M . 5, A s the note of August ICth did not, in fact, state the steps cont mplated by the Iraqi Government, I made informal enquiries at the Ministry of foreign Affairs and also put a airect question on the subject to the frime Minister. It is unlikely that I sh&amp;ll receive a detailed reply from the Ministry. Indeed, it would be too much to expect the u overn- ipent to put all their cards or: the table, since the essential element of success will probably be surprise. 6. Yssin Pasha assured me, however, that the new measures contemplated by the Iraqi overnment were preventive only, and that he ad given strict orders that there were to be no incur sions into Kuwait territory. He said that it was not the intention of the Ira^i Government to attempt to keep up a continuous patrol of the frontier with the forces at present at their disposal. This would be a superhuman task and would not be so effective as the tactics at present employed. His policy is largely expermental and consists of organising raids in force on smuggling convoys, whenever their movements can be ascertained wi h reasonable certainty beforehand. several affrays in the desert have Already been reported in the press, resulting in valuable captures by the Police, and Yasin Pasha seemed satisfied that if these tactics are vigorously pursued they will, especially ehen the new materiel arrives, prove to bi a severe check on the smuggling act ivit ies.ITo doubt the plan will be Ibe changed to meet any new moves made by the contrabandists, but if the Prime Minister sticks to this job with the ruthless persistence that has characterised his efforts to establish firm rule elsewhere In Iraq, the smuggler’s lo t will mot be a happy one. 7. It is satisfactory to record that, ao far, I have heard of no steps by the Iraqi Government calculated to interfere with the water supply of Kuwait. 8 . There is one aspect of this sorry business which is in danger of being overlooked. Yasin Pasha and, indeed, all the members of the Iraqi Government who have to do with it, have not been slow co mark that the Shaikh has openly flouted the earnest and considered advice of his protectors. I do not know what effect, if any, this is likely to have on British prestige in the Gulf, but the i mpression produced in B a gdad was one of surprise and incredulity^, and'it is possible that we have not heard the last of it. 9. Since writing the above, I have read paragraph 176 of Intelligence Summary No.15 from Kuwait and have noted the Political Agent’s comment on the inner meaning of the lachroymose loyalty expressed by the Shaikh’s devoted subjects on his return. I can only repeat that, so far as I can judge, the ’’dire and immediate' peril of annexation by Iraq, which is discerned in Kuwait, remains a complete myth. There may, moreover, be room for two opinions on the question whether bolldshed has been averted by the Shaikh’s persistant refusla to collaborate with the Iraqi Government. 1G. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and the Politic 1 Resident in the Persian Gulf.

It therefore appears that the complaint of Abduallh al Fa wad I ri and hie c ompnni ens is not haeed on actual facts, but was a natural consequence to the legitimate measures f- /M ad pted withlxi Iraqi territory for the prohibiting of smuggling and the piueuit of mu.^slt rs ^ measures which no doubt hamper the activities of smucglers who consequently attempt to seek relief fro® their effects fey putting forward euc h c* omplai n t s * rhe Ministry avail themselves of this opportunity to express thei^Mghast econsideration and esteem. j BritaiiXiic Uaj e s ty* s Embassy, BA (BAD*/ i-y (i) S X P H lii O O L X T T X H .

In^fringement of Kuwait territorial waters by Iraqi Customs ^uaunoh. /f 0 .Ml -f Reference your confidential printed letter No.909-8, dated &gt;Qth November 1955 and enclosare. N * i. The following stand out as salient points in reading the raq Ministry for Foreign affairs letter No.C/5055, dated 12th dvanber 19 35, as well as previous correspondence. (a) Kuwait claims that an armed Iraqi Customs launch not only appeared in Kuwait waters at the entrance of the Bay of Kuwait, but that it anchored in them for many hours, and held up, searched, and delayed several Kuwait sailing craft going about their noriaai business. That this all took place in the immediate vicinity of masehan Island, a point at least 50 miles from the nearest Iraqi % territorial waters. Further that the launch was seen by four reliable witnesses to come out of the Khor ^ubiyeh before it started its operations round Maschan Island which lasted for some 16 hours. (b) On the other hand Iraq, replying some five months after the above complaint was officially transmitted to her, flatly denies the incident and replies \ rU) Ui) - 2 - That their Custaas launch''did not orose into Kuwait waters n : That no doubt the accusations were made at the instance of the Kuwait smuggling fraternity, and so must be accepted for what they were worth • 3* The point that at once strikes one forcibly is that the Iraq Foreign Office merely denies 'that their Customs launch crossed into Kuwait waters'* Here perhaps lies the 'root' of the divergence of state -ments mentioned above, ana it would be interesting, not to say extremely useful, if the Iraq Government could be asked to define exactly where they considered their own territorial waters to end, and where they regarded Kuwait territorial waters to begin, taking a straight line from the mouth of the Shatt al iirab to Kuwait Town. 4. Naturally if the Iraq Government considers that Bubiyan, Mas chan and Falaika Islands belong to them then the presence of their launches roundabout the entrance of Kuwait harbour will be interpreted quite differently to what we In Kuwait understand to be the position. 5. I personally am quite satisfied from the evidence produced and from subsequent reports received by me of a confirmatory nature, that the armed launch in question did operate at the points stated, that is to say (a) That it was inside the Subiyeh channel, (b) That it held up boats between Has Subiyeh and Maschan. (c) That it sailed round Maschan Island and anchored 300 yards on its north side for several hours: and the Iraq Government’s flat denial merely begs the question, unless it actually claims the Khor Bubiyeh and Maschan Islands to be part of Iraq territory. It is a noticeable point that she only denies 'that the launch was in Kuwait waters', she does not in any way deny that it visited the spots mentioned In the Kuwait complaint.

So perhaps it is not quite fair to say that Bateman 'detailed' the measure© which have been instituted by the Iraqi Government or to refer to his conversation with Yassin as proof that the Iraqi Government are of the opinion that they are proving extremely effective.

It speaks for itself. 2 . In answer to my enquiry as t o why the arrest and disappear ance from Kuwait of the 3 unfortunate woodcutters was not reported to me, say at the end of September Inst, the Ghaikh replied that, the men were of the poorest of his subjects, and their women relatives had no on© to do this for them. It was only after the arrival back in Kuwait of th a owner of the small boat on 16th Decem ber 1935, that he came to hear of the story. you will observe, the incident occurred once age in in the Sabbiyeh channel, an entirely Kuwait water. 4 . mile the Shaikh calls the offending launch the fao Customs launch, he does not mean necessarily that it came all the way from Fao and went back again, another Fao Gustoras preventive launch and Dhow operate in the Khor 4 Aibair, and it is quite possible that it was this launch which behaved^/the lasliiou described.5. The truth would seem to be that either the launch in question acts as it does without the knowledge of hi^i officials in the department, or is being deliberately sent into Kuwait waters with the full knowledge of superior authority by way of 'trailing its coat'. unpleasant state of affairs itiichever way one looks atlh. 6 .

Kuwait. ‘ ° ~ ’ After compliments, I write to inform that on the 22nd Jamad Tliani, 1354, last (20th September, 1935) 3 poor persons of Kuwait, consisting of the owner of a small boat and two sailors, left in the said boat for Khor Sabbiyeh to cut firewood at a place . i ^ pos:L e called A1 Tha’alib. On the 27th Jamad Than! 1354 (25th Sept. 3 northern Bubiyan 1935) the Eao customs motor launch appeared and made towards ind it on them. The laxmch fired three shots at them, and shouted at aland. them to draw near. When they (the three men) came alongside the launch, they and their little jollyboat were at once seized. Then the following discourse took place between the nakhuda and the launch personnel : - Nakiiuda - What do you want of us? Personnel - We are taking, you to Pao. Nakhuda - What is our fault? Personnel - You have come here for nothing but Nakhuda / snuggling sugar, -Our boat is so small and leaks so badly that it is not possible for it to hold sugar. Moreover, we are not people who go in for carrying sugar: Y You yourselves can see our boat half- loaded with firewood. Personnel -We must take you to Pao. They were then in fact towed to Pao, and their statement having been taken, they were humiliated and were asked to pay I.D.5/- for the jollyboat, and I.D.3/- for themselves; and in case of failure they would, they were told, be imprisoned. The Nakhuda replied that they were not onlybegging their daily food from the people of Pao as iti - 2 - people of Fao as it was, 'but were, in the worst state of destitution, and could find no money to pay nor could they ■borrow it from anyone. The ?ao authorities, however, would not listen to his entreaties. They, the Kuwait sailors, were accord ingly cast into prison and after being subjected to much were humiliation, they/at last released on the 10th Bamadhan 1354 (6.12.35 )g allowed to return home. Thieir jollyboat was however confiscated and kept at Bao. The nakhuda Hasan bin Muhammad got back to Kuwait on the 20th Bamadhan (16.12.35) and in the worst state of health. I regret, indeed, to have to report such barbarous treatment from the officials at i’ao, who continue to exceed all limits of decent behaviour, and every few weeks venture into Kuwait waters and disturb and illtreat poor people like the abovementioned nakhuda. Often and often I have explained to you and given you exact details verbally and in writing of these sort of occurrences on the part of the crew of the Kao Customs launch, and I have pointed out that these violations were inconsistent with the principle of good neighbourhood. But I regret to say that I have not heard any satisfactory result as yet. In view of the friendly relations exsisting between us aid our neighbour the Government of Iraq., we are much t concerned and disappointed at this violation of our rights, and the continued activities of the abovemenuioned launch within territorial waters of Kuwait. Is it right, I ask, for them to use firearms against such poor people, and to riireatne them, and try and make them say that they were carrying sugar? what justice and what mercy allows such acts to be done.* In very truth this sort of thing can only end in the rupture ox those friendly we relations which have for so long and with such difficulty been trying to maintain with our neighbour Iraq.* As for the officials of the said department (Customs) they will no doubt once again completely deny their guilt. Nevertheless, what I have said is what actually happened, and is the entire truth, if the Iraq. Government does not3 . 06 not wish to oelieve what is taking place or has no desire to prevent the sail launch from these infringements, we shall he compelled to seize it next time it enters our waters, defore doing anything so strong as thxs, however, we feel we ought to issue this warning and ask the Iraq. Government not to raise objection, if we are compelled to take the law into oiir hand. God knows we least of all desire .nd regrettable incident hut the Iraq Government must accept final responsibility if such befall seeing that the fault will be theirs. I, therefore, beg to request you kindly to refer the case to whomever it may concern, and to let me know what proposals you have for the good and tranquility of all.

Without, of course, informing the Shaikh what I have written in my despatch, you might ask him confidentially and verbally what he would think of the idea of having a launch of his own flying his flag and patrolling the waters in the vicinity of Maschan Island etc. It will, of course, cost him some money, tut on the other hand, if the Iraqi Customs people knew that there was a Kuwaiti official launch in those -waters it would probably prevent encroach ments. Moreover, if encroachments did occur we would have definite evidence from the Kuwaiti official cie.v aboard the launch; at present most of our evidence with regard to incidents comes from private individuals, who may be smugglers, or possible smugglers themselves, and whose evidence therefore is looked upon with suspicion by the Iraqi Government. 3.

The launch could be based at Rugaija (a small settlement 10 miles up the khor ^ubiyeh where shingle was oollected for the A.I.O.C. ltd.) or at ?alaloha Island.

In th© engagement which followed the smugglers were forced to escape. However, in the morning of 12th December, 1935, the Assistant commandant of the polio® armed Gars, while doing patrol work at Al Ibtain and AX ’l&amp;haibi came across a party of these smugglers whom he arrested after having admitted their guilt. The party consisted of 20 persons and had with them 55 camels and a quantity of smuggled goods* Of these 20 persons, 8 were 'Fidaiyah' (armed retainers) of the Shaikh of Kuwait. On another occasion the Iraqi authorities found with 1 yid ibn Sl&amp;ihim, Salih Ibn Saif and Hamad iba ’Awadh li, (of the Pldaiyah of the chaikh of Kuwait) two English rifles Hob. 543 and ISfGIr, and one Turkish ’’Martin*’ rifle, all of which bore the mark of the shaikh of Kuwait.

I have, indeed, extremely regretted the recurrence of the said armed oar wandering within the frontiers of Kuwait, for I am afraid that some misunderstanding should occur on account of these transgressions, or probably something which we don’t like should occur between us and our dearest friend, our sister Government, that of Iraq.

I attach a reply from His on the lith or 12th of December 1935 and the complaint of the Iraq Government is dated the 16th of March 1936 that is after a lapse of three months. The other comments made in your letter referred to above are exactly what jumps to mind here a and what puzzles His Excellency is that so serious an allegation, tantamount to a personal ettaok upon him, should be made with £0 little apparent attempt at investigation or supported evidence; and this Inspite of what must seem a Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait to my enquir; f 2 # I would point out that the first case occurred marked absence of expedition in bringing the case to notice I have the honour to be , Bir, Your most obe di ent servant, Polit xcal Ag®it, Kuwait •After Compliments, I have with pleasure received your letter No.C-ise dated ^Oth April 1956, including a translation of a note from the Iraqi Ministiy of foreign Affairs, I have considered the contents of the note, which are very regrettable because of the Ministry’s having ascribed that our forces accompany the smugglers and cooperated with them in offering resistance to the Iraqi forces in the Iraqi territory* The ministry further says that a party of smugglers were arrested, ei$it of whom were armed Fi&amp;awis of ours. Also that the Iraqi authorities arrested ’Ayidh bin Sulaihim, Salih bin Saif and Hamad bin ’Awadh All and found with them Z English rifles and 2 Mar tin' Turkish rifles, all bearing our mark; and that t they seized scans smuggled goods at a place named 'ai Raqah &amp;1 Shamaliey', with a number of camels, among which there were two she—camels bearing the mark of ’al—dirt ham • very anxious to maintain the privileges o.i neighbourhoou with sincerity and friendship. It is not correct that we assist tbose who intend snuggling, or provide them with armed forces against our Iraqi brethren. God forbid that we should do so. I assure you that these alle ntions are not correct, for our Fid aw is are known and well controlled. Their names are known well, and they have a chief at their vfe, however, to the contrary of their opinion, are The tribal that anyone of them makes the least movement in the direction of such things* As for the Fidawis whom the Ministry have mentioned in their note, they are in our service. The au entirely unknown to us, to us, nor they are authorities may depute somebody on•» 2 *«* / somebody on whom they rely, to the place here the above FI daw is are impi isonedg in order to take e ir statements by one* and ask them to swear if they are from our servants the Fidawiyeh* *h.s .or the question of the firearms and the came Is ? that the Iraqi forces found four rifles and two she-eamel and have seen on them the mark of w Al~Birtham w , this is not improbable, as many of our camels and firearms fell to the hands of various tribesmen during the raids of Ikhwan, This is not an evidence for what has been ascribed by the intriguers and instigators who asserted that we assist those intend smuggling with an armed force against our Iraqi breth ren, God forbid that we should agree to such action.lt can never be said that our forces crossed the Iraqi frontier or did something wrong in the Iraqi territory.On the contrary we always do our best to maintain peace and tranquility between the two brother countries,which is our utmost desire in every way. The Ministry also says that there are other kinds of firearms which are being smuggled into Iraq.xo this I say that there is no factory for firearms in Kuwait .Moreover, the trade of firearms has since long been prohibited, and there is now nothing worthy of note of the firearms in Kuwait. On several occasions I informed you of the trans- gressions of the Iraqi force quartered at Safwan.This force is still wandering in Kuwaiti territory and inspecting the tribesmen of Kuwait. I here repeat my request for your kind representations to the authorities concerned with a view to preventing the said transgressions. If this continues as at present, and consequently an event which affects peace takes place, it will no doubt be alleged a designed occur rence. But our hope in God and our Iraqi brethren is fair, and Inshallah nothing will happen which will disturb the friendif^existing between both countries.

The ambassador informs me, or so I understood him to say, that the aggression by Iraq is due to the feeling of grievance aroused by smuggling from Kuwait, but even so the Iraqis seem to be overdoing the length to which their grievance might naturally if illegally take them. I do not wish to exaggerate the situation but things have reached a stage when it might almost be said without inaccuraqy that the de facto frontier of Iraq is (Ref: Million Sheets) from the ’S’ in SHIQQAT AR RAWAISAT through aIZYA to the narrows between M3SHJANI And ?

I submit this in Note form in case you wish to discuss it while here or think it worth while my submitting a Review of the whole situation which might help the Ambassador in the serious effort which -he tells me that he is about to make to settle the whole unfortunate busine ss.

This idea of a Police Officer^to investigate border cri as and allot blame X dp^hot like. You will v'' see in my official letter No.0-177 of todays date how the matter was lightly mentioned by the ambassador while here. it will not be lost upon you that the British Police Officer is a paid official of Iraq. In this particular case, Captain Sargon, who was named as the man in mina, has never been the same since - poor fellow - he was tre- panne a after an accident at Polo. 4 # The tribunal set up under Sargon would presumably sit at Basra and would not be much good unless It oould send for Kuwaiti witnesses and take evidence on oath. In other words we should soon see it talcing shape, whatever it might be at first called, as an Iradi Police Court dealing with all border cases (if not actually sentencing those it found guilty)• 5 . As soon as this Court was heard about lots of men with old or new grievances of the kind so oomon with the nomad and half-nomad - the 'stealing by finding' of cattle, and so on - would bring their cases up on the Iraqi Hon*bie Lt.-Colonel ?* Yj^rsi® Cuif, Political Resident in the J.ersi.tu B n -q H I R B *- 2 - Iraqi side of the frontier. We should I think find the ^ '* Court's activities increasing also because Jargon is one of those officials whom the Iraq Government retain to please the British Government, but taking care that he should have as little as possible to do with the Police administration and naturally pining for a more interesting full time job. i / &lt;r !u M *- (Incidentally I notice in Baghdad telegram No.Nil of the 9th May (vide your P.L.367-3 of 12.5.36) the report of ^ 'recent increase in smuggling” although no reports have com© throu#) • 6 . One way and another therefore I don*t think much of this idea and it is, I think, a most unusual one.

He wri tes : 11 In our opinion the most successful method would be for the Iraqi Government to act for the striking of the name of Kuwait off the list of Arab principalities and try to annex Kuwait to Iraq, Circumstances appear to be favourable for the successful realisation of thic idea, particularly so in view of the fact that the Kuwait administration is now known to be held with detestation by the English who are likely to agree to the idea at annex!Bg Kuwait to Iraq. w We however regret the absence of any indication that the authorities contemplate such solution for this problem. t? rTele gram Tr an To Repe ated No* Dated the G.T.C.

Sir, I have the honour to make certain observations on the existing relations between Iraq and. Kuwait, taking as an opportune occasion the reception of a copy of His ihccellency the ..jabeissador 1 s letter of Hie 20th May No.l00/l&amp;/3o to iir.Kendel at Hie foreign Office, 2 , Referrx% to the alleged snuggling I note that the Prime Minister of Iraq said, (page 3 of the letter) that snuggling v/as going on !r on a very Irirge scale''. 3 # if this is so I take it that the Iraq Government would have no difficulty in proving it? Could they be asked to do so giving all relevant details including the names and particulars (tribe or place of domicile; of all Kuwaitis now in prison In Iraq for snuggling, when imprisoned and what quantities of smuggled goods were found with them? should have sa* iuoa then how we stand. 4&gt; His Excellency the Ambassador 1 see in replying 3 aid that Kuwait 'lived largely 011 its entrepot trace'. This I think from so^ recent and careful enquires is a slight misunderstanding as the order in importance ofKuwaife means of livelihood is now pearling, closely followed by the carrying trade in the Indian Ocean the Kea Sea and along the African Coast, some way behind boat-building and only of entrepot trade in the usual fourthly ordinary trace. ^ w there is today none or only aquite sense of the word tneie i.» '-uuaorquite negligible quantity* ( »iien before the War the entrepot trade was greater it may have held third place, the trade rtth the interior being mostly directed to HfilL, the then Capital of the Hash id s and the towns of in Nejd and not with Iraq)• be now and then overloo^d, that there is still a fairly extensive trade with the Bedouin who come to Kuwait annually. They slowly, in a matter of months, move towards Kuwait and its better grazing areas and as slowly move their tents by stages away again. Most of them later i.e, in the Spring or early Summer recross the Sauai Arab frontier, or the Iraqi, and pay in those countries in about three years out of four their taxes* On arrival and , as may be needed during their stay and before moving off they restock. 6 . This restocking (MUSABIIA) is not now, by Ibn Baud anyway, called smuggling. 7 1 Most of the Iraqi tribesmen abovementioned, Shamioar and Muntafiq, return each May to Iraq* This may account for the 'recent increased smuggling'. The best way to stop this, if the Iraq Government wish to do so, would be for them to control their tribes and prevent them ever coming into Kuwait. In the latter connection I would point out what may be helped and s Kuwait would lose some trade but it could not and she could have no grievance at Iraq keeping Iraqi tribes inside her frontiers* Once they are here i is inhuman and impracticable to prevent selling to them. Once they are here it is inhuman Apart from this I find re dxixx ! is mu^eh smuggling any longer. I find it difficult to believe that there 9. Iraq has had its effect. I from many different sources Customs who this be rather an e The 'large and costly' (vis a vi « Kuwait may not ther an exaggeration?) preventive service of ad its effect. I have made numerous enquiries The 'large and coinclinea to a critical attitude) and always receive the same answer that smuggling has now very much decreased. It is most unlikely in view of the freedom with which I move and speak with people here that a deliberate conspiracy of silence could be kept up and I believe that it i s true that smuggling other than 'Husabila' - if that is so called - i s now as near negligible as smuggling may be, or in any case is certainly not largely increasing. His Excellency the Ruler however thinks that there may still be some in tea, sugar and Iraqi cigarettes. The latter it seems have a light export tax but a heavier internal tax, 10. These articles it is thought are smuggled mostly by the Shaw^iya or donkey sections of the Muntafiq tribe (Iraq) perhaps moving Sast of the Zubair road and probably crossing the frontier roundabout Umm. Qasr. They seek cover as it were from the sections of their tribe camped here. 11 , With regard to the 'continuance of smuggling, especially of arms and ammunition' it is noted that His Excellency said that he would be glad to receive details of any positive instances which had come to light and that the Prime Minister replied that 'as the arms were passed on through the tribes it was very difficult to establish proof'. IB. I take it from the Prime Minister’s two remarks read together that he has abandoned the allegation made in the Iraq Foreign Office letter to the iuabassador No.c/734, dated the 16th March 1936 that the Shaikh is himself running caravans, or that anyone is, as caravans are oatchable and evidence, but that rifles are passing in ones and twos but constantly from hand to hand across the frontier from out of Kuwait. IK. If this is so the suggestion, which the Prime it is difficult to prove, may be examined Minister admits-r ' ~ 4 - ^}$%) ■I Jr \ tf' ^ examined on the general evidence available. V. 1 S J 14. it is from this, 1 think, most likely to have been true for rifles in iu-abia are known to pass from hand to hand like shares in the European markets and are regarded more or less in the same light* 15. Vhsnever there is a demand, as at the present momeh on the Middle Euphrates, there is certain to be a drift of weapons in that direction as the Prime Minister must know, !&amp;• Mnt the number, other things being equal, coming in from Kuwait would necessarily be smaller than from bigger countries with longer frontiers adjoining Iraq, such as Saudi Arabia, Syria and perhaps Persia. Other things however are not equal. The entry of arms into Kuwait is under strict supervision. His Excellency the Huler himself cannot import a shot gun without permission from the Political Agent. The Persian Gulf sloops also make it a practice to examine dhows at sea and have not found arms hereabouts or destined for Kuwait. Information too is good and numbers of rifles could not be landed without ie being known. On the other hand in neighbouring country large stocks are frequently landed, as may be seen for example from the official -ritish reports from Jedda and the Monarch customarily gives to visiting Shaikhs presents of arms which sooner or later go into circulation, (inspite of arms carrying regulations). Thus it is reasonable to suppose that the ^ j rirr in from Kuwait would, by comparison proportion of arms going m irom ivuwax or any standard, be very mall indeed^. 19 . Local information here is that fairly large numbers do go into Iraq by other frontiers when there is a demand. The wells of TOM AH iUDHOMMA south west of the Iraq Neutral mentioned as being on the smugglers route, general 18. Zone are always the smugglers being individuals (not Shaikhs or whole section, I- 5 - but very frequently of the Shamraar or Dhafir tribes. (f SfJ to the Wadi an district; where the Anaza are in this exceptional summer still camped; and from the North through the Wadi al Miya and the Qara depression. ^^expei'ts 01 the Bureau des Benseignments in Syria and our frontier service in Transjordan would I have no doubt confirm the fact that arms do drift access those frontiers when there is a demand, if ashed. 22 . if this is so it seems rather unfair to stigmatize Kuwait for her mite. 23* Since my return from Baghdad on the 30th May His Excellency the Ruler has in any case issued the strictest orders to the Emir of dahra to watch for the passing of even single arms in the direction of Iraq. Excellency the -ambassador wishes to do, and taking the existing time and conditions it would appear from general evidence, from local information here, and in the absence of proof to the contrary from Iraq that there is now no g^n uggling except in the smallest quantity from Kuwait to Ir&amp;cs• It does however seem evident that the Iraqi N-ovemment is stigmatizing Kuwait. 25.

This paper publishes these articles only 3 months after a representation and warning. The very strict control which Iraq has over her newspapers through the Press Bureau, which, as has been locally noticed, has been maintained well in the case of the recent troubles on the Euphrates, might perhaps if the Cabinet were agreeable be applied in the case of the attacks on Kuwait? 28. If such articles brought the Editors into serious trouble, with the Iraqi G-overnment they would, I feel sure, not appear. trouble for crossing the frontier I leel equally sure that they would not do so. That the newspaper articles and transgressions of the frontier continue seems to prove that the Iraqi Cabinet has departed from that rectitude which one 29.

Two of these cars stopped at a distance from him. The third one came and stopped near to him.

Three 'Iraqi cars came to the them, which carried some policemen headed by one rt Mahdi,. a customs official. They attempted to search the tribesmen 1 O tents, but the latter prevented them, saying: 'What is the offence on a ccount of which you intend to search our tents and women, while we are Kuwaiti tribesmen and in Kuwaiti frontier.' Mahdi replied to them, saying: H Kuwait has no frontier. H Lastly, however, seeing that the tribesmen were many and averse to their tents being searched, the 'Iraqi oars left them and returned. 3 In fact I am afraid that some undesirable affair may occur on account of these repeated wanderings of cars within the frontiers of Kuwait. I have already writt en to you about these cars and their previous actions within th e frontiers.

British officials stood as mediators between the Iraqi Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait to try and solve the smuggling issue. They discussed possible ways to persuade the Shaikh of Kuwait to agree to a friendly arrangement for cooperation for checking smuggling on the lines which had been contemplated. British Government officials also suggested various methods to control smuggling such as a system of manifests, trade control posts, as well as the appointment of a British Director of Customs at Kuwait.The volume includes minutes of a meeting held in London discussing the question of Kuwait-Iraq smuggling with the Shaikh of Kuwait, a list of regulations of the Customs Code in Iraq issued by the King of Iraq and published in the official gazette, correspondence related to a number of cases of violation of Kuwaiti territorial waters by Iraq Customs launches, as well as the arrest and detention of Kuwaiti nationals.The Shaikh raised his complaints to the Political Agent who in turn shared the Shaikh’s concerns with other British officials. On the other hand, complaints were also raised by the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding the Kuwaiti Government’s lack of control of its border lines.Lists of violation incidents are also included in the volume. Each list includes the following information: date and place of occurrence by whom, a summary of the incident, date of report to the Political Resident and the Iraqi Government’s reply. The volume also includes summary lists of Iraqi newspaper articles which discuss Iraq-Kuwait related issues including smuggling, and the annexation of Kuwait by Iraq.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customs policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boats</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00004e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
