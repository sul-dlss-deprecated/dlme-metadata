These views were communicated via the Foreign Office to the Porte in March 1878 and the subject lay dormant until February 1882 when Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, Lord Dufferin was again informed of the intention to construct a telegraph line from Taiz to Aden, to which he replied with the same objections as in 1878 and again proposed that a submarine cable might be equally suitable.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Assistant Secretary to the Political and Secret Department,</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Ottoman Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Taiz</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Telegraphs</topic></subject><subject><topic>Spheres of influence</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000121#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
