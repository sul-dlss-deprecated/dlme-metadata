They would come at their own expense and not as guests of His Majesty or His Majesty 1 s Government. 2.

The decision in regard to Gulf Rulers has been arrived at in the light of Fowle 1 s views as to local importance of not allowing it to be thought in the Gulf that these rulers had been forgotten and consequent (tf mu^t) of extending to them some form of invitation though they might not avail themselves of it*4.

News Film of the Coronation. Sir, I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to inform you that arrangements have been made, with the co-operation and approval of the appropriate authorities, for cinematograph films showing the Coronation ceremony and the accompanying celebrations to be prepared by the five major newsreel companies operating in England, viz. : Gaumont British News, British Movietonews, British Paramount News, Pathe News and Universal Talking News. 2. There was some intention of making a combined film, but this idea was abandoned and each of the five companies concerned will independently produce its own film. That portion dealing with the ceremony inside the Abbey will, however, be common to all, and the complete films will not vary greatly as among the five companies. Thus in effect there will be five long films instead of short newsreels, as the whole of the newsreel space for the day of the Coronation will be devoted to the Coronation pictures. In addition. British Movietonews, the only British company in a position to do so, will produce a separate version in colour, but it is not yet certain whether arrangements can be made for any part of the Abbey ceremony to be included in this version. 3.

The newsreel companies in this country intend to suggest to their associate companies abroad that invitations should be extended where possible to certain of His Majesty’s Diplomatic Representatives and consular officers abroad to attend special exhibitions of these Coronation films. It is desirable in the interests of the national prestige of this country that, if your engage ments permit, you should give your patronage or support, by attendance at special performances or by any other means which, in the light of local conditions, you may consider advisable, in order to help the companies to secure the widest possible publicity for the Coronation films. Should you be approached by the local film companies in this connexion, Mr. Eden would be glad, therefore, if you would give whatever facilities or support you properly can to the film companies concerned in this matter.

C/250-12/14. The Agency, Bahra in, Dated the 3rd April 1937. I met the new Senior Naval Officer informally this morning (April 1st) and among ether matters mentioned arrangements for the Coronation. 2. I asked if he thought that a combined parade of the Royal Navy and the Bahrain Armed Police, as was carried out at the Jubilee and during the visit of the 1st Destrqyer Flotilla, would be appropriate. He said that at first sight, he welcomed the idea. 3. He mentioned that he had orders from the Adniralty to give a reception M as senior representative of the King”, which he proposed to hold in the evening. I said that it might be a little awkward as on such occasions (the King*s Birthday, Jubilee) there was usually a reception in the Agency, and added that the Political Agent was His Majesty^ representative in Bahrain. I said that, so far as I was concerned the matter did not affect me as I should I hoped be on leave, but that I thought that the principle of by whom the reception was to be held should be settled between you and him, before anything was made public. He was very pleasant about it and said that he was sure the point could be happily disposed of, but that he had definite oixiers to hold a reception ( I have not seen the orders and it is just possible that they may have been as-read). 4. The essential point is that whoever holds the reception find .vhex ever io is held, it should be as good a show as circumstances permit. 5. / The Hon * ble Lieut.-Colonel T .C .Fowle, CBE. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSH IRE.- 2 - 5. I should like to discuss this question with you on your arrival, if I may, but think that you may like to discuss it with de 'laury and Stewart in Kuwait, as I understand that an escort vessel is to be there for the Coronation. Yours sincerely, sd. G.LOCH.Mote* Subj ect : Oolcmel Loch’s demi-official letter iio* c/2b0-12/14 of the 3rd April 1937 - Arrangements for CORONATION. I discussed this with Captain de Gaury and Stewart in Kuwait. Prima facie it would seem that the Representative of the King in each of the Agencies is obviously the Political Agent and the precedent on all previous occasions, as Colonel Loch points out, has been that the reception is held by that official. One solution would be to have two receptions, one by the Political Agent and one by the Naval officer. This is hardly practicable, however, as it would be difficult to get the Arabs to turn out to two receptions, and in any case the evening reception will be considered the more important of the two. 2. I will discuss with Colonel Loch and the Senior Naval Officer at Bahrain. 3.
