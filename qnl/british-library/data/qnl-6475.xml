This item would also be reduced if the railway were carried from Ahwaz. While the concession might distinctly specify Burujird as the objective, it would, perhaps, be prudent to proceed tentatively, making it obligatory, in the first instance, to carry the line only so far as Bizful, as an experimental section. This might be built whilst the country beyond was being surveyed, for much examination in such country is imperative. Ahwaz to Bizful, 91 miles, requiring, say, 500,000/., would he a fair section for experiment. Shuster to Bizful, only 36 miles, 200,000/., would be rather a short section, but there would also be the works for turning the Ahwaz barrier. India Office, * 12th June 1886. (Signed) E. C. S. Williams, Colonel, Boyal Engineers, Beputy Government Birector of Indian Guaranteed Railway Companies.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000089_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C52</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000089</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C52</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Note on a Railway for Southern Persia, by Colonel E.C.S.
