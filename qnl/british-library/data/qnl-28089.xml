SECOND MEMORANDUM OF HIS BRI TANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT RESPECTING THE CLAIM OF MESSRS. ROBERT WONCKHAUS AND CO. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SHIPMENT OF RED OXIDE FROM ABU MUSA. [The marginal references are to the German text of the Second German Memorandum.] HIS Majesty’s Government have had under careful consideration the memorandum drawn up by the German Government relating to the occurrences on the island of Abu Musa, which was forwarded by the German Ambassador on the 4th December, 1909. In view of the nature of the arguments and evidence contained in that memo randum, it has been found necessary to cause further enquiries to be made in the Persian Gulf, and, although every effort has been made to avoid unnecessary delay, it has been found impossible to prepare the observations of His Majesty’s Govern ment upon such arguments and evidence at an earlier date. For convenience of exposition, the conclusions arrived at by the German Government, as sum marised on pages 27-29 of their memorandum, are set forth each under a separate heading and printed in italics ; the observations of His Majesty’s Government upon such conclusions, and upon the arguments and evidence by which they are sup ported in the body of the memorandum, are sub joined in ordinary type. Copies of all documents referred to, except such as have already appeared in previous communications, are annexed in the appendix. His Majesty’s Government desire first to offer a few preliminary remarks on some of the facts which are enumerated on page 3 of the memorandum of the German Government as not being disputed. [926] B » « Ilia 11 *17097His Majesty’s Government agree that Sheikh p. 3. Sagar was prevented by the British resident from driving Sheikh Salim out of Abu Musa by force. There is no doubt that Sheikh Sagar, supported as he was by all the tribesmen, was in a position to treat Sheikh Salim, who had no means of defend ing himself, in any way he pleased, and it was only because Sheikh Sagar loyally submitted to the warnimr of the British resident that there must be no breach of the maritime truce that Sheikh Salim was allowed torema in in Abu Musa Island at all, and that arrangements were made for his maintenance. His Majesty’s Government would observe that p- 4. Abdul Latif, father of Esa, was not the British “ consular agent,” but Residency agent. With regard to the statement that “ the rent p- 4. was paid regularly, and received by Sheikh Salim,” His Majesty's Government would point out that the German Government have omitted all reference to Sheikh Sagar’s statement that, on being informed by Sheikh Salim of the concession that he, acting as Regent, had granted, he voluntarily set aside the amount of the rent, as forming part of the revenue of Abu Musa, for Sheikh Salim, in order to make up his allowance to the original sum of 600 dollars, or more (see Appendix 5 to First British Memorandum). His Majesty’s Government would also point out P- 4. that the statement that the share of Sheikh Sagar was on the 10th October, 1907, sold by Hassan Samieh to Thomas Brown is somewhat misleading, if unaccompanied by any reference to the fact that such sale took place eight months after the cancellation of the concession by Sheikh Sagar, and a week after the delivery of the final order that all work was to cease. His Majesty’s Government cannot agree that p. 4. the summary of the terms of the contract between Hassan Samieh and Herr Robert Wonckhaus is accurate, and would refer to the terms of such contract as set out in Annex 5 to the First German Memorandum. Similar observations apply to the summary of Sheikh Sagar’s letter of the 21st February, 1907, to Hassan Samieh (Annex 12 to First German Memorandum).3 P- With reference to the statement that Sheikh Sagar on the 3rd October, 1907, again ordered that the work should cease, IT is Majesty’s Govern ment would suggest the addition of the words “ and that he should remove his coolies and gear within ten days.” Similarly after the words “Thereupon, about the 20th October, 1907,” the words “ Hassan having taken no notice of this warning” should be inserted to render the state ment complete. P- 5. His Majesty’s Government are unable to concur in the account given by the German Government of the attempted landing on Abu Musa by two employes of the firm of Robert Wdnckhaus and Co. The facts of the case are that Mr. Brown and several employes of Robert Wonckhaus and Co., who, His Majesty’s Government contend, had no right on the island at all, attempted to land, and persistently ignored warnings that were given. Finally, as they (hsre'gSt’rd’e.cl'all friendly attempts to deter them from landing, a fe w shots were fired 'C over their heads (Appendix 28). Mr. Brown has 1 never made any complaint to the Residency on the subject. His Majesty’s Government now proceed to the consideration of the conclusions arrived at by the German Government. I. pp. 27, 28. (a.) Sheikh Salim is owner of the island of Abu Musa; (6.) and therefore, according to the commercial law 'prevailing on the Persian Gulf, had a right to lease the oxide mines there to the mining company. Hassan-ihn-Ali and Co., in his own name. According to the Moham medan religious law he could not conclude the lease agreement; according to that law, however, the company would have acquired the exclusive right to the produce of the mines simply by the fact of working them. It will be convenient to consider the above statements under two heads (a) and (b). (a.) Before considering the new arguments and pp. 5, 6. evidence put forward, His Majesty’s Government would point out that the allegation contained in the Second German Memorandum that the British4 memorandum is inaccurate in stating that Sagar granted to Salim the revenue of the island, in cluding that derived from the mines, is not warranted by the facts ; nor is it accurate to say, as the German memorandum does, that “ Sakar in his own account only speaks of having assigned to Salim the amount of the rent of the oxide mines.” Sheikh Sagar’s statement was as follows : “ Seeing that Sheikh Salim had ceased not to complain that the sum of 400 dollars was not sufficient for his subsistence, I voluntarily set aside the amount of this rent for him, that it might make up his subsistence, so that the total of what came in to him yearly might be 600 dollars as befoie, and over, and that no cause of soreness might be left to him on account of the paucity of his allowance. I have absolutely not given him any deed in con nection with the island nor in regard to the mines therein ; all I did was to relinquish the income to him in the way of financial assistance from me to him, and it was done voluntarily and at my own discretion ” (First British Memorandum, Appen dix 5). The words “ I have absolutely not given him any deed in connection with the island nor in regard to the mines therein ' show clearly that the word “ income” which follows refers not only to the income irom the mines, but to the whole income derived from the island. And Sheikh * Salim states : “ You were kind enough to place the island of Abu Musa under my supervision, so that T might cultivate therein and leap from ii' the means of subsistence” (First British Memo randum, Appendix i). There can be no doubt that Sheikh Sagar permitted Salim to enjoy all revenue that might accrue from the island. In practice the only substantial revenue was deii\ed from the oxide mines ; the other sources of income mentioned in the Second German Memorandum • ^ will be discussed later. •* The question at issue being whether the island of Abu Musa is the property of Sheikh Salim or of Sheikh Sagar in his capacity as Sheikh of Shargah, His Majesty’s Government brought forward as evidence in support of their contention declarations by both the suggested claimants, each of whom stated in the clearest possible way that the island is the property of Sheikh Sagar (First British Memorandum, Appendices 1 and 5) Evidence of so cogent and convincing a nature— - . - ■ w ■ ■ mgm ■ • (D ^ 5 can seldom, if ever, have been brought forward in a case where the title to land was in question, and His Majesty’s Government can only express their surprise that the German Government should decline to accept such evidence. The objections suggested to such evidence seem to be as follows :— 1. The statements were made by interested parties. 2. They were made while the case was in pro gress and steps were being taken to collect evidence. 3. Major Cox was at Shargah at the time when they were made. 4. They are out of harmony with the former attitude of the two sheikhs. 1. It may be conceded that the statement of Sheikh Sagar (the date of which should obviously be, as suggested in the Second German Memo randum, 1908 instead of 1898) is open to the objection which may be taken to the evidence given by any claimant in support of his own case. But how it can be suggested that Sheikh Salim is “ interested ” in disproving his alleged title to the island His Majesty’s Government are entirely unable to understand. The effect of the cancella tion of the contract by Sheikh Sagar has been that Sheikh Salim has lost a considerable portion of his income, and the suggestion that the latter would be ready to give false evidence in support of the contention that Sagar had a right to take the step which has had such unfortunate results for Salim is one which cannot be maintained for a moment. The statement of Sheikh Salim’s (to which he still absolutely adheres) is a declaration entirely against his interest, and is conclusive. 2. His Majesty’s Government agree that these statements were made after the question of the ownership of the island had been raised, and when evidence on the point was being collected. His Majesty’s Government do not attach much weight to this objection, which would apply with at least equal force to much of the evidence contained in the annexes to the Second German Memorandum ; they would remark that there would obviously be no reason for making such statements (especially that of Sheikh Salim) before the question of title had arisen. 3. If this objection means that His Britannic Majesty’s Besident, with the object of strengthen- [926] €6 ing the case, deliberately induced the two sheikha to make statements which he and they knew to be untrue, His Majesty’s Government cannot entertain any such suggestion. • 4. This point will be discussed later.*'• His Majesty’s Government also produced, as further evidence of Sheikh Sagar T s ownership of the island, two letters written by him in 1884 to the British resident (First British Memorandum, Appendices 3 and 4). It cannot of course be disputed that these letters were written long before the question of title had arisen, but the German Government deny that they can be relied p. 6. on as evidence of Sagar’s ownership. His Majesty’s Government are unable to accept P- 6. the German Government’s account of the circum stances under which these letters were written. These circumstances have been explained above. At the time of Salim’s deposition Sagar had all the tribesmen at his back, while Salim had no follow ing at all; the only question was whether Sagar should forcibly remove Salim from the island, which course would involve a breach of the mari time truce. Sa^ar informed the British Besident on the 17th May, 1883, that he proposed to adopt this course, and was informed in reply that* in order to avoid a breach of the truce he ought to arrange a peaceable settlement (First British Memorandum, Appendix 6). This was accord ingly done ; but had not Sagar been anxious to comply with the wishes of the British Besident there can be no doubt that Salim would have been forcibly and permanently removed from the island, agreement was arrived at, and Salim, who at the time of his deposition was at Abu Musa, was permitted by his successor to reside there. The agreement, however, did not work satisfactorily. Under these circumstances Sagar writes to the British resident to the effect that three courses are open: (a) that Salim should give a guarantee that he will do nothing to disturb the maritime truce ; (h) that the British Government should remove him from the island ; (c) that the British Government should stand aside while Sagar dealt with Salim .as he thought fit. In both letters he states %7 clearly that the island is his property as Sheikh of Shargah. His Majesty’s Government cannot accept the contention of the German Govern ment that all Sagar claimed was that Abu Musa was “ politically a dependency of Shargah.” There would be no object in Sagar’s making such a statement to the Resident, who was well acquainted with the fact, and such an inter pretation would render the letters meaning less, as there was never a suggestion of Salim’s setting up an independent state in Abu Musa. The meaning of the letters is clearly that if Salim is to be allowed to live on the island, instead of being forcibly ejected, his occupation must be distinctly understood to be without prejudice to Sagar’s rights as owner, and the peace must be kept. His Majesty’s Government would remark, with reference to the use of the words “ I,” “ we,” “ my,” “ our,” in the above letters, that in the original Arabic the plural forms are used throughout. His Majesty’s Government are also unable to accept the contention of the German Government that when Sagar uses the w^ords “ our ” or “ my island ” the meaning is “ the island belongs politically to the territory of Shargah,” while the same words in the mouth of Salim mean “ the island is my private property.” The cases in which Salim uses the words “ my ” or “ our island ” are considered below, but it may be remarked that in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government no evidence of ownership can be derived from the use of such words by an occupier; every man who pays rent for the house he lives in speaks of it as “ my house,” but that does not mean that he is the owner. With regard to Sheikh Sagar’s letter of the 11th October, 1902 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 7), the German Government remark : “ In order to understand the letter, it w T ould be interesting to know the purport of Kemball’s enquiry, to which Sakar’s letter was an answer, and which is not printed in the memorandum.” The letter from Colonel Kemball referred to was in the following terms :— “ A report has reached me that you wish to grant a concession to Haji Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh for excavating and exporting red oxide• 8 from the island of Sir Abu Nuair. I have there fore the honour to inform you that it would be advisable for you to let me see the draft of the concession before concluding the arrangements. “ I shall also be glad if you will let me see a copy of the concession granted to Haji Nakhoda Ali for working the red oxide mines on the island of Abu Musa.” It will thus be seen that the arguments based by the German Government on conjectures as to PP* the words used by Colonel Kemball fall to the ground. Colonel Kemball’s only object was to offer advice to the sheikh (as it was his duty to do) as to the terms of any concession he might propose to grant. This was the more necessary as Nakhoda Ali was a person of doubtful character (see Appendix 9). The sheikh rep' ies that Colonel Kemball was mistaken in supposing that Nakhoda Ali was one of the concessionnaires, and states quite accurately the circumstances of the grant, including the fact that Salim made it as Regent. His Majesty’s Government are unable to agree with the German Government that “ it cannot P* 8 - be inferred from this letter that Salim was acting only as Regent”; the fact is stated in the plainest terms, and strong corroboration is derived from the phrase used in Esa’s letter to Sheikh Sagar dated the 20th February, 1907 (Appen dix 27)—“the lease which I and two partners acquired from the Government of Shargah relating to the extraction of red oxide from your island of Abu Musa.” With regard to the suggestion that the statement that Salim cultivates in the island p. 8. implies that he was the owner of it, His Majesty’s Government would only remark that if this contention is correct every tenant is the owner of the land he holds. No inference can be drawn from the quotation from the Administration p. 7 Report on the Persian Gulf, which appears to be based on incomplete information. The locality of the mines is not stated, and the erroneous state ment is made that Nakhoda Ali was the lessee, while it is expressly stated that further enquiry will be made. With regard to the statement alleged to have been made on the 28th November, 1907, by p. g. Sagar on the subject of the treaty of 1892, the account of the conversation which the sheikh gave to His Majesty’s Government soon after it took place does not tally with that contained in « 4 r9 V the Second German Memorandum, and His Majesty’s Government cannot accept the latter as accurate. As the German Government are no doubt aware, and as will be shown later, the dragoman Mirza Hussein has now been shown to be a person on whose statements no reliance can be placed; further, lie could not speak Arabic, and the interpreter was Abdullah-bin-Hassan-Samieh, Hassan Samieh’s son, a person who was interested in putting such a statement into the sheikh’s mouth. p. 8. His Majesty’s Government are disposed to agree that the meaning of the sentence in the sheikh’s letter “ and the lease has remained up till now ” is probably that Sagar acquiesced in the conces sion when he returned from Mecca, as is stated by both the sheikhs (First British Memorandum, Appendices 1 and 5). At the time the letter was written nothing had occurred to make Sagar con sider the cancellation of the concession advisable. His Majesty’s Government cannot agree that Sagar’s statement that he voluntarily assigned the rent of 250 French reals to Salim is “an ex parte statement for which there is no proof ” ; it is evidence of the best kind, and is supported by Salim’s statement, “ When I leased the mines of Abu Musa I was officiating on your behalf, and the concession was given by proxy for you ” (First British Memorandum, Appendix 1), which shows clearly that Salim would not have received the rent from the mines if it had not been granted him by Sagar. The alleged facts with which the statement is said to be inconsistent are considered below. His Majesty’s Government would point out that the phrase “ the amount previously promised or to a little over that amount ” is an incorrect reproduction of Sagar’s words; the Arabic is “ wa ziyadeh,” i.e., “ and over ” or “ and more.” p. 9. The suggestion made by the German Govern ment that Sheikh Sagar’s right to pasturage on Abu Musa may be merely a servitude to which the private property in the island is subject is entirely unsupported by evidence, and is not borne out by Major Cox’s report (First British Memorandum, Appendix 6), to which reference is made). [926] pp. 8, 9. p. 9. p. 8. DThe German Government enquire why, under P ^ the arrangement of 1884, the revenue of Sir Abu Nuair was given to Salim to increase his pension, and not that of Abu Musa, which would have been more convenient, as he resided in the island. The suggestion is that the revenue of Abu Musa already belonged to Salim as owner. The answer is that it would have been useless to give Salim the revenue of Abu Musa, because at that time the island produced no revenue at all. This is shown by an extract from a letter written on the 14th October, 1880, to the British agent by the Residency agent, who, speaking of Abu Musa, says : “ Its water has altogether become salt, and the trees have died away. He ” (the Sheikh of Shargah, then Sheikh Salim) “ does not get anything from the place, not even a * gaz ’ ” (a small copper coin). It is now proposed to consider the fresh evidence adduced by the German Government in support of the contention that Sheikh Salim is the owner of Abu Musa. It is asserted that “ Salim has always exercised P- 9 - the right to wreckage on Abu Musa.” His Majesty’s Government are not concerned to enquire whether the statement made is adequately supported by the citation of two cases in which pp. 9, 35. such a right has been claimed, because, even assuming the statement to be correct, it furnishes no evidence whatever of the ownership of Salim. The right to wreckage, or jetsam and flotsam, is exercised in the Persian Gulf by the inhabitants of the place where the wreckage is cast up, and if the rulingj^lj lpf comes to hear of it he is entitled to a snareTwhich he exacts or not as he sees fit. In the case of Abu Musa the right to wreckage was exercised not by Salim alone, but by him in conjunction with the other inhabitants of the island, so that any argument in favour of Salim’s ownership, based on the right to wreckage, would be an equally good argument in favour of the ownership of all the inhabitants. In support of this statement the following documents are adduced :— Letter dated the 17th May, 1894, from the Residency agent, Shargah, to the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, relating to the stranding of a Bahrein boat on Abu Musa (Appendix 1). Replies to above, 22nd June, 1894 (Appendix 2).11 7 Letter dated the 14th April, 1907, from the Residency agent, Shargah, to the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, relating to the stranding of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company’s steam-ship “ Bulimba ” on Abu Musa (Appen dix 3). These letters show clearly (a) that it was “ the islanders,” and not Salim alone, who claimed the right to wreckage ; (b) that .it was the Sheikh of Shargah whose position and responsibility in the matter were recognised. V Y &lt; ► On the general question of the incidence of the right to wreckage, and the position and practice in regard thereto, the following evidence is sub mitted :— lW. \ ' Letter dated the 1st March, 1895, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Assistant Resident, Bunder Abbas (Appendix 4). Statement by Sheikh Sagar, dated the 25th March, 1911 (Appendix 5). Questions put to, and replies received from, the fo lowing sheikhs and notables of the coast:— I , .i 1 ^(Muhammad -bin-Tahnoon, agent of the Sultan ' I of Muscat at Lingah (Appendix ,6).

Haji Muhammad-bin-Hassan-el-Meithoomi-el- Marzooki, a leading merchant of Bustaneh. % i|, V*w&gt; (Appendices 7 and 8.) The effect of this overwhelming body of evidence is to show clearly that the right to wreckage is exercised by the inhabitants of the locality, subject to the rmht of the chief to claim a share if he sees fit to do so. No evidence of Salim’s ownership can therefore be deduced from the fact of his exercising such a right ; if Salim claimed and exercised the chief’s right to a share, it would be by virtue of Sheikh Sugar’s permitting him to occupy the island, and any income which he derived from such a source would form part of the revenue of the island, which he was permitted by the sheikh to enjoy. It may also be remarked, with reference to the terms of Salim’s letter of the 23rd March, 1898 (Second German Memorandum, p. 21. Annex 6), that at that time Salim was acting as Regent, and probably wrote the letter in that capacity. The German Government next refer to a version pp- 9, 10. of the oxide agreement (Second German Memo- PP- 35-37. randum, Annex 7), dated the 6th April, 1898, which was cancelled four days later, and for which another agreement (Second German Memorandum, Annex 8) was substituted. This first agreement contained the words “ So long as 1, my children, and my brothers live, no one shall have a right to raise objections to it.” These words were omitted from the second agreement, and it is suggested that the use of such words clearly shows that Salim was the owner of the island. The position is thus as follows :— An agreement is drawn up.13 It is immediately cancelled, and a fresh one substituted. Certain expressions which appear in the first agreement are not found in the second. His Majesty’s Government consider that the irresistible inference to be drawn from such facts is that the omitted expressions were objected to as inaccurate or misleading, and that for that reason the agreement was cancelled. His Majesty’s Government are in a position to show that such was the case. Abdul Latif has explained (Ap pendix 9) that the original agreement was drafted by Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh, and was shown by him to Abdul Latif, who at once objected (a) to the use of the expression now under discussion ; (b) to the inclusion of Nakhoda Ali as a signatory. The draft w'as accordingly cancelled and a fresh agreement drawn up, in which the objectionable expressions were omitted. The original draft was never seen by Sheikh Sagar until it was shown to him a short time ago (Appendix 5). So far, then, from the use of the expressions referred to being evidence of Salim’s ownership, their omission from the second agreement is strong evidence against it. Reference is also made to the clause in the second agreement providing for a payment for the trade in “ mother-of-pearl and canary-seed.”* It is suggested that this is “ inconsistent with Sheikh Sagar’s statement that he had granted to Salim only the rent of the oxide mines.” It has been pointed out above that Sheikh Sagar has never made the statement attributed to him ; what he did say was that he had granted to Salim the revenue of the island, which of course included this payment in connection with oysters. IS or can any inference be drawn from the fact that the agreement under which Sagar became a partner provided that he should be responsible for a proportional part of this payment. The syndicate derived their rights from the document of the 10th April, 1898, under which both the annual rent and this special payment were secured, and any person entering the syndicate * It may be observed that the Arabic word translated “canary-seed” more probably refers to a kind of oyster. [926] E14 would of course be as responsible for his share of the second as of the first. Sheikh Sagar, haying assigned the revenue from this source to Salim, naturally, on becoming a partner in the syndicate, had to pay his proportion of it to him ; but it is impossible to conclude from that fact that' “ Salim p. lOi had a right to the enjoyment in his own name of all sources of profit to be derived from Abu Musa, and that he could exercise this right even as against the ruling sheikh.” He had the right because it had been granted to him by the ruling sheikh, and when the ruling sheikh became a partner in a syndicate which was under contract to pay rent, which rent had been granted to Salim, he was of course bound, in his Capacity as such partner, to pay to Salim his proportion of such rent. Even if the rent had been payable to himself, his share of it would of course have been debited to him in the partnership books. The object of the insertion of the clause in question was no doubt to make it clear that the liabilities of the other partners were proportionately reduced. The German Government also rely on the fact pp. 10 , 37. that on the 26th December, 1898, Salim granted a lease of the mica deposits on the island. The fact is not disputed; it is clear that the lease was granted after Sheikh Sagar had relinquished to Salim the revenue of the island, and it appears from Sagar’s statement (Appendix 5) that Salim consulted him about it, and that in pursuance of his declared policy he allowed Salim to keep any payments made on account of the mica as part of the revenue derived from the island. Sagar would no doubt welcome any arrangements which would increase Salim’s income and prevent his making applications for money. Little attention has been paid to this transaction, because it was soon discovered that no mica existed on the island, and the concession accordingly became a dead letter. When Sagar wrote his letter of the 22nd February, 1908, he had no doubt, as he states (Appendix 5), forgotten all about this concession, granted ten years before, and long since abandoned. The draft memorandum of association sent by Abdul Latif to Hassan Samieh on the 6th January, 1899, will be considered later. The fact that Salim stipulated in the mica lease p. 11. that only keshkeshuh trees should be cut is no evidence of his ownership. He was admittedly in occupation of the island, and was therefore *15 entitled to see that acts of waste were not com mitted thereon. With reference to the letter dated the 12th November, 1898, from Abdul Latif to Hassan Samieh (Annex 15 to Second German Memo randum), in which reference is made to a dispute between the two sheikhs about the island of Sir, the position (which, indeed, is obvious) is explained by Abdul Latif (Appendix 10). Under the 1884 agreement between Sagar and Salim (see Appendix 6, First British Memorandum) the revenue of Sir was assigned to Salim. The island, however, failed to produce any revenue, and in the 1889 agreement (see Appendix 6, First British Memorandum), no mention was made of it, the revenue of Abu Musa being subsequently transferred to Salim in its place. When the possibility arose in 1898 of Sir pro ducing some revenue, Salim put in a claim to it under the agreement of 1884, to which Sagar not unnaturally replied that the 1884 agreement had been superseded by that of 1889, in which Sir was not mentioned. Thus arose the dispute referred to. Abdul Latif was naturally unwilling to conclude the Sir agreement until the dispute had been adjusted; he would have no hesitation about Abu Musa, not because he knew that Salim owned it, but because he was well aware that Sheikh Sagar was allowing him to enjoy its revenue. Finally, the German Government state that the opinion prevailing among the most respectable natives is that Abu Musa is the private property of Sheikh Salim. In support of this assertion there are quoted the opinions of three merchants of Lingah, two of whom are also stated to have asserted verbally that everyone who has any knowledge of affairs on the Arabian coast is of the same opinion. His Majesty’s Government regret that they are •unable to attach the slightest weight to the opinions of the persons in question. Abdalmuhsin-ibn-Ahmed Almushari is a petty trader of Bahrein origin. He earns a precarious livelihood by speculating in pearls with borrowed money. Abdarrahman-ibn-Muhammed-ibn-Kazim is aPersian of Bastak. It is true that he was at one time French consular agent at Lingah, but in 1909 he was dismissed by the French consul, who had had occasion to complain of him. In 1907 he was proceeded against by the Customs for smuggling a large quantity of tobacco, and he has recently been complained against for unlawfully' flying the French flag on a dhow. Hamd-ibn-Khalifa Al’uyuni was a petty mer chant, but went bankrupt, and afterwards endeavoured to make a living as a news-writer by writing gossip to various notables in the Gulf, and getting occasional presents from them. He recently died insolvent. As against testimony of this nature, His Majesty’s Government bring forward the evidence of nineteen sheikhs, merchants, and notables of the Persian Gulf, who are familiar with the affairs of the district. The names of these persons have been given above, and their statements are set out in Appendices 6, 7, and 8. They state that the owner of Abu Musa is the Sheikh of Shargah, now Sheikh Sagar. His Majesty’s Government agree that Salim, with the consent of Sheikh Sagar, exercised (from the date of the arrangement made after the grant of the oxide concession) the full right of disposal of the usufruct of the island. This right was de rived from the permission granted to him by the owner, Sheikh Sagar. It is denied that he exercised the right “as against” Sagar, except in so far as the latter, while a partner in the syndicate, was responsible for the payment of his proportion of the rent. Finally, His Majesty’s Government would enquire how it is suggested that Salim obtained his title to the island. His right to it as Sheikh of Shargah was lost when he was deposed ; and if the contention is that he had any other title there should be in existence documents of title or other evidence showing whence it was derived. No such evidence has been produced. Having thus examined the objections raised to the evidence brought forward in support of Sheikh17 ySagar’s title, as Sheikh of Shargah, to the property in the island, and having considered , the further evidence and arguments adduced in favour of the claim made on behalf of Sheikh Salim (though not endorsed by him), His Majesty’s Government are compelled to adhere to their conclusion that Sheikh Sagar is the owner of Abu Musa. pp. 27, 28. (b.) Salim not being the owner of Abu Musa, and the revenue of the island not having been transferred to him at the time of the grant of the concession, he had no right, either according to commercial or Mahommedan or any other system of law, to grant a lease of the oxide mines, except in his capacity as Regent. The lease having been acquiesced in by Sheikh Sagar when he returned and took up the reins of government, he succeeded to the position occupied by Salim with regard to the agreement, except that he allowed Salim to receive the rent as part of the revenue of Abu Musa. The question of the validity of the lease will be more conveniently discussed under the next head. !4.H. P 28. The owner of the island, whoever he may be, has no authority, either according to the lease agreement (which is to be judged by com mercial law ), or according to religious law, to revoke or terminate the rights of the mining company or to hinder the company in any other way from working the mines. p. 12. His Majesty’s Government are unable to accept the contention of the German Government that Sheikh Sagar had no right to terminate the agreement. Quite apart from the terms of the concession, he had, as ruling sheikh, absolute power to cancel it at any time he thought fit. If this were not so, the words used by Salim, in his capacity of Regent, in the agreement of the 10th April, 1898, “ Should I at any former date have made any contracts they are not valid, only this contract, which is written in two identical copies, holds good ” (First German Memorandum, Annex 2) would be meaningless, and any previous contracts [926] Fwould be valid as against the present concession- naires. His Majesty’s Government maintain that Sheikh Sagar’s right to determine any concession granted in his dominions (a right which would exist even if the island were the private pro perty of Salim) could not legally be questioned, and, indeed, this is admitted by the statement on p. 14 of the Second German Memorandum that “ the reigning Sheikh of Shargah is the absolute ruler of his country.” If by a high-handed and unfair use of this right the concessionnaires, who at the time of the cancellation were all British subjects, had suffered , loss, they could only obtain redress by an appeal to their Govern ment, in which case the matter would be solely one between the sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. This being the case, it is unnecessary to discuss further the meaning of the terms in the agree ment. His Majesty’s Government find it difficult p. 12. to decide what was the reason for omitting the time limit of twenty years in the second agree ment, as the meaning of Abdul Latif’s statement (Appendix 9) that he “ saw no object in inserting any fixed period of time ” is not clear ; but they would remark that if the effect of the agreement really was that the lessees were entitled to put an end to the lease at any time, while the lessor was bound to allow them to work the mines in per petuity, should they so desire, in return for a rent of 20L per annum, the arrangement was most inequitable. For the same reason His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that the case is not one to which the principles of either the commercial or religious law can usefully be applied. But as the German Government produce evidence of this nature on which they rely in support of their contention that the lease was valid and could not be cancelled, it is proposed to deal with the point. The German Government produce opinions PP- 13 ’ 14 * given by “ the leading merchants at Lingah and Bussorah,” who state that the lease is good and19 p. 27. 'valid, and cannot be terminated without the consent of the lessees. His Majesty’s Government are unable to agree as to the weight to be attached to the opinion of these merchants; their reasons for considering that no importance can be attached to the opinions of Hamd-ibn-Khalifa Al’uyuni, Abdarrahman-ibn- Muhammed - ibn - Kazim, and Abdalmuhsin - ibn- Ahmed-ibn-Mushari have been explained above. With regard to the other merchants whose opinions are quoted, His Majesty’s Government cannot from the information at their disposal accept the description of them given in the German Memorandum. Abdullah Muhammed Has san-al-Kh odja is a member of a family which is ill-disposed to the authorities, and his testi mony is open to suspicion. Abdullah-ibn-Hassan- Kalladari is a close friend of Hassan Samieh, and agentj/of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. The signatories of the document which appears as Annex 24, are Turkish subjects from Bussorah, whose views on such a matter are of little weight, and as they erroneously state that the “agree ment was concluded in the land of Persia,” their opinions appear to be founded on a wrong assumption. p. 44. 11 In refutation of this evidence the opinions are submitted of ten representative merchants from different parts of the littoral (Appendix 11), who are unanimously of opinion that the lease is void, because it lacks both the specification of period and the pronunciation of the legal formula of proposal and acceptance, which are essential features of such documents. pp. 14, With regard to the contention that by religious law surface mines are the common property of all Mahommedans, and that an indefeasible right is acquired by the mere fact of working them, His Majesty’s Government are somewhat surprised that such an argument should be seriously put forward at the present day. It may be that the clergy of Islam continue in theory to support this ancient tenet, but it is a matter of common know ledge that it is now entirely disregarded, and no attempt could possibly be made to give effect to it in practice.His Majesty’s Government would remark, with reference to the opinions of the clergy submitted by the German Government, that it will be seen that several of them, on their attention being _ called to the grounds on which His Majesty’s Government contend that the lease is invalid, declared that such a contention was correct. His Majesty’s Government submit a body of evidence from distinguished members of the clergy (Ap pendices 12, 13, and 14), including the chief priests of Lingah and Bushire, both Sunni and Shiah. The effect of this evidence is to show 1. That the lease was invalid for several specific reasons : (a.) The failure to insert the usual formula of proposal and acceptance. (b.) The failure to specify the period of the lease. (c.) The failure to specify the amount of profit to be derived by the lessee (Appendix 12). 2. That the lessor is therefore entitled to cancel the lease and eject the lessee (Appendices 13 and 14). His Majesty’s Government are therefore of opinion — 1. That Sheikh Sagar had, as ruling sheikh, an inherent right to cancel the concession, if he saw fit to do so ; 2. That if the principles of either commercial or religious law are to be applied to the case, the lease was invalid, and could therefore be annulled. The German Government are mistaken in pp. stating that “ The British memorandum further remarks that the principal object of Sagar was to administer justice as between the partners of the company on the strength of his ‘ sovereign rights of jurisdiction.’ ” The statement made in the First British Memorandum (p. 26) was “ The principal motive of the Sheikh of Shargah in cancelling, in accordance with the exercise of his sovereign rights of jurisdiction, the lease granted in his behalf by the Regent in 1898 wus evidently12 21 a proper and natural desire to administer justice as between the partners of the company . . . The contention of His Majesty’s Government is, and always has been, that the sovereign rights of jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Shargah gave him the right to cancel the concession. The word jurisdiction was not meant to imply judicial jurisdiction, but the right of government. The f&gt;. 15. questions therefore whether the sheikh “ had authority to decide as judge the dispute between the partners of the mining company,” “ whether the decision arrived at was justified by law,” and “ whether he had power to cancel the lease at his discretion in the interest of the administration of country ” are strictly irrelevant. In view of the careful consideration, however, given in the Second German Memorandum to these points, they will be dealt with in their proper place. III. p. 28. (a.) Hassan Samaih had authority, as manager of the mining company, to conclude agreements like that with Mr. Wonckhaus, signing in the name of the company, without consulting the other partners. Such agreements at once became binding on the other partners; (b.) in the case under consideration, however, their approval was also signified. This point will be conveniently considered under two heads, (a) and (b). p. -21. (a.) The German Government argue that the wide dispersal of the partners rendered it necessary that one of the partners should have authority to act for the others. His Majesty’s Government agree that it is not unlikely that such an arrange ment would be made as regards the ordinary incidents of business, although there is nothing to show that such an arrangement was made, or, if it was, that Hassan Samieh was the partner selected to act on behalf of the others ; but the question now at issue is whether Hassan Samieh had authority, without consulting his partners, to conclude an agreement such as the present, which disposed of practically the whole output of the. mines, at a fixed price, for four years, with an option of renewal, and limited the annual output of the mines to a maximum of 5,000 tons and the further small amount which was allowed to go to [926] G22 India. Such an agreement was entirely outside the ordinary incidents of the partnership business, and it would require strong evidence to show that Hassan was in a position to enter into it without the knowledge or consent of his associates, especially as there was no need to carry matters through in a hurry, and the short delay necessary to enable the other partners to be consulted would not have prejudiced the conclusion of the agree ment, provided that they had raised no objection. The principal evidence on which the German p. 21 . Government rely consists of an unsigned document pp. 39 , 40 . (Annex 14 to Second German Memorandum), purporting to be a memorandum of association between the lessees, the first clause of which is alleged to give power to Hassan Samieh to con clude sales on behalf of the partnership. This document is said to have been drawn up by Abdul p. 21. Latif, and sent by him in a letter dated the 6th January, 1899 (Annex 13 to Second German pp. 38, 3 ( J. Memorandum), to Hassan Samieh, with a request that all the partners at Lingah should sign. It is further alleged that the document was signed p. 21. by Hassan Samieh, Abdullah, and Nakhoda Ali, who added a clause providing for the purchase of boats, and returned the document to Abdul Latif. On the 21 st January, IS99, A.bdul Latif wrote a letter to Hasson Samieh (Annex 40 to Second pp. 06 , 57. German Memorandum), in which he objected to pp. 21 , 22 . the purchase of boats. Hassan Samieh then replied agreeing to the cancellation of the boats, and thereupon the arrangement is said to have become operative. No evidence, except Abdul Latif’s two letters, is produced in support of the statements made. It appears from Abdul Latif’s second letter that when Hassan Samieh and his partners at Lingah returned the document to Abdul .Latif with the additional clause about the boats they made certain other suggestions in a covering letter. Abdul Latif objected to these suggestions as well as to the provision about the boats, and there is no ground for alleging that the arrange ment became operative merely because Hassan agreed to waive the provision about boats. It is not suggested by the German Government that the memorandum was ever signed by the other partners, Sheikh Sagar, Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, and Mr. Malcolm, who, as stated on p. 12 of the Second German Memorandum, was a partner in the company, but who had entered it, not “ two23 years after the conclusion of the lease agreement,” but on the 27th December, 1898 (see Appendix 16). It is hardly necessary to remark that no such document could be binding on the partnership unless signed by all the partners, and that there fore the document is valueless. The mere fact that clause 6 of the memorandum, to which Abdul Latif objected, and which Hassan Samieh, p. 21. according to the Second German Memorandum, was willing to cancel, was never struck out, but appears in the document as now produced, shows conclusively that the memorandum was never completed or executed, and consequently never came into operation. This is also shown by the fact that no accounts have ever been rendered to the partners who were not at the mines (see Appendix 17), whereas under clause 9 of the alleged memorandum this had to be done every four months. A further statement by Abdul Latif is annexed (Appendix 15) which shows clearly what occurred. After Abdul Latif’s letter of the 21st January, 1899, objecting to several of the suggested pro visions, the matter dropped. The document was never completed or signed by the remaining * / , partners, and was never even shown to Sheikh Sagar. It has never been seen by Nejef (Appen dix 22). Mr. Malcolm states (see Appendix 1 7) that, to the best of his belief, he never saw or heard of the so-called memorandum, and certainly never signed it. In any event, even if the document were taken as being in force, there is nothing in its terms which would justify Hassan in entering into contracts, other than ordinary sales, with out consulting his partners. The contract with Wonckhaus cannot be regarded as an ordinary sale, because (apart from the small shipments to India) it prevented the sale of oxide to any other person, and because, in effect, it would necessarily have limited the output to the amount taken by Wonckhaus and the purchasers in India. This document, then, having never come into force, the only agreement governing the affairs of the partnership was that dated May 1898 (First German Memorandum, Annex 2), under which Hassan Samieh had no such powers as suggested. The manner in which the affairs of the partner ship were conducted is shown in Mr. Malcolm's statement (Appendix 17). It is, of course, not24 disputed that Hassan did attend to part of the business of the company, as did some of the other p- 23. partners, but that fact has no bearing on the question whether he had authority to make the contract in question. The same comment may be made on the letters from Mr. Malcolm to Hassan, PP* 57-59 on which reliance is placed by the German P- -S- Government; in fact, the first two letters are clear evidence that Hassan did not consider him self entitled to act'without consulting his partners. The third letter is specifically addressed to the firm, and not to Hassan, and there is no evidence to show how it was dealt with. His Majesty’s Government are unable to agree that the proposed contract was “ very similar to that with Wonck- p. 23. haus,” but do not consider the point worth detailed discussion. No inference in favour of the conten tion of the German Government can be drawn from these letters. Esa’s letter to Sheikh Sagar, dated the 20th February, 1907 (Appendix 27), shows that he did not consider that Hassan possessed the authority now claimed for him, and four letters from Hassan Samieh are annexed (Appendix 18), which show that Hassan considered himself under an obligation to consult his partners, and knew that they were entitled to complain if he failed to do so. The phrase in Hassan’s letter of the 21st January, 1908, “You know what friendship existed between us and your father, Haji Ali, deceased, who did nothing except after consultation in our business,” suggests that, if one partner was more prominent than the others, it was Nakhoda Ali, and not Hassan. Hassan’s own contention throughout has been, not that he had authority to conclude the con tract without consulting his partners, but that they approved of it. In his letter to Abdul Latif (Annex 11 to First German Memorandum) he says: “ You are the Lord of the Learned ; you know that I did this knowing that you were agreeable to it.” In his letter to Salim (Annex 18 to First German Memorandum) he says: “ As you know, all the contracts and correspondence from the beginning till this day have been done by knowledge and approval of the British political agent, Abdul Latif, and all of you.” This shows that at the time he did not claim for himself the right which is now' attributed to him. In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government would remark that, if Hassan really possessed the right© 14 p. 16. p. 16. p. 17. p. 17. pp. 17 25 to conclude the contract without consulting his partners, it is difficult to understand his attempts to conceal it from them, and to deceive them as to its terms. (b.) The German Government also contend that all the partners expressly approved the agreement. The persons concerned (omitting Ahdullah, who may be assumed to have supported his father) are Esa, Malcolm, and Nejef, son of Nakhoda AH. The German Government dispute that Nejef was a partner, arguing that Nakhoda Ali •“ had a share on the strength of his engaging to super intend the work at the mines, without putting capital into the concern,” that his partnership was connected with personal services, and there fore ceased at his death. This contention is not supported by the terms of the document under which he became a partner (Annex 2 to First German Memorandum), which placed him in precisely the same position as the other partners. Moreover, as it is pointed out on p. 18 of the Second German Memorandum that the only partners who put any capital into the concern were Hassan and Malcolm, it follow's, if the contention of the German Government is correct, that the other partners, who neither put capital into the concern nor superintended the work at the mines, had no claim to their shares at all. The suggestion that Nakhoda Ali was not a partner, but only an “employd of the company with a share in the profits,” is plainly untenable, in view of the provision in the document under which he became a partner (Annex 2 to First German Memorandum) that he was to bear his share of the expenses—an unheard-of pro vision in the case of an employe. It appears from Malcolm’s statement (Appendix 17) that Nakhoda Ali was originally the most important member of the firm ; and reference may also be made to the sentence quoted above from Hassan’s letter to Nejef, dated the 21st January, 1908. , so. The suggestion made by Abdul Latif, that it might be possible to extinguish Nakhoda Ali's share at his death on the grounds indicated, must have come to nothing, judging by the later documents as if the surviving partners had thought it possible to get rid of the share in such a way, they would certainly have done so. [926] H26 It may be that Hassan and Abdullah now con-- p. 17,' sider it advisable to deny that they considered Nejef a partner, but their letters written at the time (Appendices 18 and 19) show clearly that they did so consider him. The letters of Hassan, in particular, which are set out in Appendix 18, are conclusive on the point. Particular atten tion is also called to the letter dated the 24th December, 1907, from Malcolm, annexed in Appendix 20, which shows that at that time both Malcolm and AbduTih recognised Nejef as a partner. If ^sejef was not and never had been a partner, the suggestion that he on several occasions p. 17. expressed his approval of Hassan’s proceedings is meaningless; there would be no possible reason for; his expressing an opinion on - the matter if it did not concern him. Nejef is asserted to have expressed his approval p- 17. to Abdullah, in the presence of the German dragoman in November 1907. No authority is g n en for this statement. Abdullah’s motives for attributing such a statement to Nejef are obvious, and His Majesty’s Government have explained already that they are unable to attach any weight to statements made by the ex-dragoman Mirza Hussein, who, as the German Government are no ' doubt aware, has now been denounced by the Persian Government, prosecuted by the Customs and Messrs. Wonckhaus for dishonesty, and dis missed from his post in the German consulate. Nejef has sworn an affidavit (Appendix 21) in which he denies having made the statement attributed to, him, and his account is corrob orated by the letter written shortly afterwards by Malcolm, which is set out in Appendix 20, and also by Nejef s petition to Lieutenant Gabriel dated the 16th February, 1908 (First British Memorandum,.Appendix 18). These documents • also show plainly that Nejef was recognised as a partner. With regard to the statement said to have been pp. 17, 50, made by Nejef to Brown (an employd of Wdnck- 51, haus and Co.) in March 1908, to the effect that he approved of the contract with Wonckhaus, the story is incredible, in view of the fact that a month before Nejef had sent in a formal petition to the British vice-consul at Bunder Abbas (First British Memorandum, Appendix 18) stating that he “did not in any way agree to this contract made by Hassan.” Nejef s account of the inter- i *view, as given by him on oath, is set out in Appendix 21. But even if the story were true, it would not affect the fact that in February 1 908 Nejef expressed his disapproval in the most formal method at his disposal. In any case His Majesty s Government are unable to consider an expression of approval, given long after the cancellation of the concession, as equivalent to a confirmation of the contract. His Majesty’s Government observe that the German Government do not allege that Malcolm ever expressly approved of the contract; all that is stated is that no objection was raised by him. Without going into the question whether a failure to raise objections could amount to the necessary approval, it must be pointed out that no inference can be drawn either from Malcolm’s silence or his letters, because of Hassan’s successful attempts, by means of falsehood and deception, to keep him in the dark as to the facts. When asked by Malcolm for a copy of the agree ment, he first made the untrue statement that the agreement was in German, and then asserted that Wonckhaus had bound him to secrecy ; while the account given by him in his letter of the 13th July, 1906 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 13) omitted the most important provisions of the contract. His Majesty’s Government are quite unable to agree that this letter “ communicated all that was of importance ”; the very provisions to which the other partners took objection when they heard of them were carefully omitted. This argument is also inconsistent with the further contention of the German Government that Hassan was entitled to keep the terms of the contract secret from Malcolm, because the latter was connected with Strick and Co., who held the Hormuz oxide concession. His Majestyh Government are unable to appreciate this contention, and in any case it is clear from Hassan’s letter of the 14th October, 1906 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 14), that the person he really wished to keep in the dark was Abdul Latif, who had repeatedly warned him against making a contract of such a nature. In his letter of the 30th October, 1906 (Annex 34 to Second German Memorandum) Malcolm expressly protests against the terms of the agree-ment being kept secret from the partners. This letter also expressly recognises the possibility of the cancellation of the contract by the partners, if they considered it advisable. When Malcolm did ultimately receive a copy of the agreement in December 1906, the contract was already six months old, and while he was still considering what action to take the situation was completely changed by the cancellation of the concession bv the sheikh. His Majesty’s Government do not dispute the p. 19 fact that Abdul Latif, on behalf of Esa, did not object in 1905 to the sale of oxide to Wonckhaus at a fixed price, but, as it is not suggested that the contracts of that date contained the provisions to which he did afterwards object, it does not affect the present question. As regards his letter of the 14th June, 1906 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 12), His Majesty’s Government must repeat that no weight can be attached to any expression of approval (if such can be deduced from the terms of the letter) given in ignorance of the terms of the contract. The non-disclosure of material terms would be held fatal by any court in which it was sought to rely on any such expressions of approval as constituting a ratifica tion of the contract. And the letter expressly warns Hassan against entering into any contract which would give an outside party an excuse for claiming rights in the island. Such warnings had been given before, and Hassan had disclaimed any intention of entering into such a contract. In addition to the documents already quoted in this connection, reference may be made to two letters from Hassan to Abdul Latif, dated respectively the 30th January, 1905, and the 5th July, 1906 (Appendix 23). No doubt Hassan’s object was to conceal the terms of the contract from his partners for as long as possible, in order that when they were ulti mately discovered he might be able to say that the contract had been in operation so long that it was impossible to go back on it. When Abdul Latif had an opportunity of examining the terms of the contract he objected in the plainest terms, and announced his resolution of cancelling the contract. The German Government contend that the p sentence in Abdul Latif’s letter of the 23rd 20 .29 pp. 52, 53. p. 20. pp. 53-55. p. 20. January, 1907 (Annex 36 to Second German Memo randum), which has been translated “ the nullifi cation of this agreement is better than its accept ance,” really bears the meaning “It is better to try to cancel the agreement than to do as he [the German] wishes.” In support of this contention two opinions are quoted (Annexes 37 and 38 to Second German Memorandum) which reach this conclusion upon different grounds. Both these opinions are purely theoretical, and do not take local usage into account. His Majesty’s Govern ment would point out that in Enclosure 8 to the First German Memorandum the words in question are translated “ The cession [? cessation] of this contract would be preferable to its continuance.” His Majesty’s Government also bring forward, in support of their view, the opinion (Appendix 24) of the well-known missionary the Rev. S. M. Zwemer, who has laboured for some fifteen years among the Arabs of the Persian Gulf, and probably knows their local peculiarities of speech and writing better than any other living man. His opinion entirely supporls the contention of His Majesty’s Government. Being, however, of opinion that when the meaning to be attributed to a phrase is in question, the best evidence is that of the person who used it, His Majesty’s Government annex a statement (Appendix 25) by Abdul Latif, which makes it clear that he used the words in the sense attributed to them by His Majesty’s Government, and that such would be the ordinary meaning of the phrase as understood in those parts. The statement also shows that Hassan understood the words in that sense, and quoted them in that sense (but more grammatically and unmistakably) in his reply. This reply is set out in Appendix 26. His Majesty’s Government do not agree with the contention that Abdul Latit’s letter, by re commending the cancelling of the agreement, admits that it had legal force. It is admitted that the contract was binding as between Hassan and Wonckhaus and Co., and therefore Hassan could only be released from it by cancellation; but the question at issue is whether it was bind ing on the partnership, and His Majesty’s Govern ment contend that the evidence, is clear that it was not. There is no doubt that Esa himself objected to the contract when he heard of its terms. This is clearly shown by his letter of the 20th February, [926] I1907, to Sheikh Sagar (Appendix 27), which also proves that he did not consider Hassan as having authority to conclude the contract without con sulting his partners. His Majesty’s Government are therefore of opinion :— 1. I hat Hassan had no authority to conclude the contract in question without the consent of his partners. 2. That Nejef was a partner on the same terms as the others. 3. That neither Nejef, Malcolm, nor Esa ever approved the agreement, but, on the contrary, at least two of them, when they heard of the terms, formally expressed their disapproval. 4. That even if any expression of approval can be deduced from the terms of Abdul Latif’s letter dated the 14th June, 1906, it was given in ignor ance of the most important terms of the contract, which had been wrongfully concealed by Hassan from his partners, and that on hearing of those terms Abdul Latif emphatically repudiated the transaction. IV. &lt; * 1 The agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is advan- p. tageous to the mining company, so that the partners have not been injured by Hassan Samaih s action as manager. It is not considered necessary to consider again the question whether the agreement was finan- P- cially fur the benefit of the company, especially as, no accounts ever having been rendered by Hassan to his partners, it is impossible to test the accuracy of the books as now quoted. It is onlv necessary to remark that at least two of the partners considered that the arrangement w^as not advantageous to the company, and formally protested against it. It may also be added that, if it really was to the benefit of the company to enter into the contract, it becomes more difficult than ever to account for Hassan’s anxiety to conceal its terms from his associates. It is possible, however, that this desire for concealment was due to a feeling that the contract might impair the relations between the company and the sheikh, in which case it would not be to the advantage of the company, even though financially it might have led to an increased revenue.31 y. p. 28. There was therefore no reason for a complaint of the company agamst Ilassan Samaih on the ground of action contrary to agreement or duty. This point has been discussed under the two preceding heads. VI. p. 28. There was accordingly no ground for action on the part of Sheikh Sagar against Ilassan Samaih for the protection of the other partners. Moreover, the seat of the company is at Lingah, and the partners of the com pany are not subjects of the Sheikh of Shargeh, so that he has no jurisdiction in matters concerning the relations of the partners with each other. In any case, he could not exercise such jurisdiction himself, hut should have had the dispute settled by the judge. Although it is hardly accurate to say that Sheikh Sagar took action against Hassan, it has been shown that there was abundant ground for his action when appealed to on behalf of the partners whose wishes and instructions had been disregarded, and who had been deceived, by their associate Hassan. It has been already pointed out that it has never been contended by His Majesty’s Govern ment (or, as is admitted on p. 15 of the Second German Memorandum, by Sheikh Sagar) that the p. 15. sheikh’s action in cancelling the concession was intended to be that of a judge deciding the rights of the partners as between themselves ; it was an act which in his sovereign capacity he was entitled to do, and no doubt one of his objects was to release the complaining partners from the position in which they found themselves owing to the unauthorised action of Hassan. This being p. 15. so, the arguments adduced in the Second German Memorandum to show that the sheikh was not the proper tribunal to adjust the rights of the partners are beside the mark. It is only neces sary to remark that, as far as the cancellation of the concession was concerned, the sheikh was the only person who could act.After the cancellation of the concession, the adjustment of the rights of the partners, as between themselves, by the appropriate tribunal (whatever that may prove to he) would under normal circumstances have been an easy matter. Nor is it impossible that the sheikh might have been willing to grant a fresh concession under proper conditions. But the course events have taken, in particular the intervention of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., has so far rendered this impracticable; though when the questions now at issue have been settled it may yet be possible for steps to be taken in the matter. In any case, the question whether Sagar’s action violated the rights of the partners, who were all British subjects, is obviously one to be discussed, if at all, between the sheikh and His Majesty’s Govern ment. VII. The agreement between the mining company and Mr. Wonckhaus, which is nothing hut the conclusion of an ordinary and permissible business transaction, and which cannot have any political aims, neither infringes the lease agreement nor is in any way dangerous to the interests of the State of Shargch, so that • the action taken by Sheikh Sugar against the company cannot be justified on the ground of the general interests of the administration of the country. It has been already pointed out that, whether the sheikh’s action was “justifiable” or not, it was certainly one which he had power to take, and could not legally be questioned. His Majesty’s Government agree that the contract with Wonckhaus was not strictly a letting of the mines to him. But it is submitted that it was not unnatural that the sheikh should look with some apprehension upon the acquisition of so large an interest in the produce of the mines by persons who were subject neither to his juris diction nor to that of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf. The German Government are aware that as late as 1904 an attempt was made to seize Abu Musa by a Belgian customs officer in the Persian service, who hauled down the sheikh’s flag and hoisted the Persian standard. And it cannot he denied that the actions of Messrs. Wonckhaus have been eminently calculated33 to suggest that they were anxious to claim rights in the island and not merely in the produce of the mines. Thus, on the 19th October, 1907, Messrs. Wonckhaus wrote to the sheikh :— “We consider the mines and the concession for them as a security for the advances paid. If you force Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Somayah and Co. to withdraw their coolies and representatives, we shall have to send over some men ourselves to protect our property/’ When Brown and his men left for the island on the 22nd October, 1907, they took with them a Ge rman flag ? which it was in tended to place on the accumulations of oxide. On the 19th November, 1907, the German vice- consul at Bushire threatened the sheikh with a claim for a lakh of rupees, and claimed for Messrs. Wonckhaus the right of direct concern in the working of the mines. His Majesty’s Government entirely agree with the German Government that the question in this case is purely commercial, and not political. But in view of the above facts, it appears that Sagar’s fears were not altogether as “ senseless ” as has been suggested. For reasons already given, h )wever, His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that the question whether such considerations “justified” the sheikh’s action does not arise. VIII. Sheikh Sakar's interference is not limited to redressing a wrong alleged to have been done by one ‘partner to the others, -or to preventing the carrying out of an agreement alleged to be contrary to the interests of the country, but simply deprives the whole company of the basis of its existence. The company, in which the German firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co. have a share, is thereby very seriously injured, since the realisation of its object is made impossible, and it is not in a position to cam'y out current obligations imposed upon it by contract. No new points are raised under this head. Sheikh Sagar’s action was the only one he could take with a view to putting an end to the position in which the company found itself owing to the [926] Kaction of Hassan. It may be mentioned that so far from Sheikh Sagar having “ put in his pocket P- l 6 - the whole valuable object in connection with which the company was founded,” the result of his action has been that no revenue has been received from the mines from that day to this. The question whether Wdnckhaus and Co. can be considered as interested in the company is considered below. It is no doubt unfortunate that the company has been unable to resume its operations since the cancellation, but,' as has been pointed out above, that is not the- fault of the sheikh, but is due to the course which affairs have taken. IX. Sakar's proceedings, then, are clearly a violation P- of law—an exercise of arbitrary power. The German Government do not suggest what law it is that was violated by Sagar’s proceedings. His Majesty’s Government have already pointed out that the sheikh’s right to cancel the concession is one that cannot be questioned, and that it is a mistake to consider his action as an adjudication of the rights of the parties as between themselves. His Majesty’s Government must also repeat, that even if Sagar’s proceedings were “ a violation of law,” the question would be, under the circum stances, one which could only concern the sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty’s Government regret that they are p. 29. entirely unable to recognise Messrs.. WSnckhaus and Co. as in any way concerned in the present question. It is clear that Messrs. Wonckhaus had a trood cause of action for breach of contract against Hassan; or, if the contention of the German Government were correct, that the con tract was binding on the partnership, they would have a cause of action against the partnership. They have never attempted to avail themselves of either of these remedies. It is obvious, there fore, that Messrs. Wbnckhaus can have no claim against Sheikh Sagar in their capacity as parties to the contract, whether it was made with Hassan or with the mining company.35 p. 29. It would appear that no serious attempt is made in the Second German Memorandum to maintain the proposition that Messrs. Wonckhaus are concerned in the matter as having purchased a share in the partnership eight months after the cancellation of the concession. Apart from the fact that the transference of a share in an extinct concession could have no legal effect, it is difficult to see what cause of action, either in contract or in tort, could exist against the sheikh, at the suit of Messrs. Wonckhaus, for cancelling a concession to which they were not parties. It is not dis puted that Messrs. Wdnckhaus were aware, at the time when they purported to purchase the share, that the concession had been cancelled. Even assuming that the cancellation was unjustifiable, it cannot be disputed that it was effective, and that the concession came to an end at that time. If the cancellation was unjustifiable, it might give rise to a claim for compensation by the persons who were partners in the firm at the time, but certainly not to a claim by persons who, with full knowledge of the facts, purported to acquire a share months later. Thus, in any case, Messrs. Wonckhaus have no locus standi; and His Majesty’s Government can only regard their action as an attempt to place themselves in a position which would enable them to bring pressure on the sheikh. It is noteworthy that an attempt was made in November 1907 to induce Nejef to transfer his share to Abdullah (see Appendix 21), and the fact that the transfer was to bear a date previous to the contract between Wonckhaus and Hassan, and therefore previous to the cancellation of the concession, suggests that the intention was to retransfer the share to Messrs. Wonckhaus. It may also be remarked that the sales of the share in question by T ussuf to Hassan, and by Hassan to Brown, were invalid in any case, because the documents of transfer did not bear the signatures of all the partners, as was neces sary under the deed by which Malcolm became a partner (see Appendix 16). The concession having been cancelled, and Hassan having disregarded the warning given him on the 3rd October, 1907, to remove his coolies and gear within ten days, the sheikh was clearly entitled to take steps to ensure theirremoval. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government to ensure that no breach of the peace should take place was explained in the First British Memorandum. His Majesty’s Government have already given the correct account of the proceedings when Brown attempted to land on Abu Musa. It is clear that the employes of Messrs. Wonckhaushad no right to be on the island at all, and this is admitted by the statement on p. 26 of the Second German Memorandum : “The stipulation that the oxide is to be delivered free on board, and the detailed arrangements concerning the quantity to be loaded daily, make it clear that Mr. Wonckhaus was not to have anything to do with the working of the mines themselves.” Thus the sheikh had a perfect right to prevent the men from landing, and no claim for compensation can possibly be put forward on those grounds. His Majesty’s Government are therefore of opinion that Messrs. Wonckhaus have no claim against Sheikh Sagar or His Majesty’s Govern ment. Jice, 6 ,1911.Appendix 1. The Residency Agent, Shargah, to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. May 17, 1894. A letter reached me from the residency agent residing at Bahrein, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Chief of Bahrein regarding a jolly boat belonging to one of Sheikh Isa’s subjects, named Mohamed-bin-Saleh-bin-Jehara, which stranded on the Isle of Abu Musa. Your servant endeavoured to release the jolly boat from the hands of the inhabitants of Abu Musa for the sum of 70 dollars; at the time Mohamed-bin-Saleh- bin-Jebara was present with me the inhabitants of Abu Musa refused, but [would] only accept half [of the value of the boat and cargo], according to custom. Mohamed-bin- Saleh-bin-Jebara departed from Bahrein to inform his chief [and point out] that should he desire to entreat the Chief of Shargah on account of friendship or [for] other reason [the latter would release it]. When the [Bahrein] agent’s letter reached me I returned an answer according to what had passed on this subject, but no reply has come [to it]. According to what is noticed by me [i.e.], that the inhabitants of Abu Musa voyage in the jolly boat and convey cargo, it has become necessary to inform you, as probably that an accident may befall the boat. It is better that the owners of the jolly boat should strive to release the boat. Bahrein agent’s letter, a copy of the Chief of Bahrein’s letter are enclosed. Appendix 2. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Residency Agent, Shargah. Bushire, June 22, 1894. Your letter dated the 17th ultimo, together with its enclosures, regarding the boat .of Mohamed-bin-Saleh-bin-Jebara rescued by the inhabitants of the Island of Abu Musa has been received. If no previous agreement has been made by the parties regarding the amount of salvage, and if the circumstances of the case show that the claim for a half share of the boat and cargo is exorbitant, you may use your good offices with the Chief of Shargah to induce to salvers to accept such remuneration as may be just and reasonable according to local custom and usag^e. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Residency Agent, Bahrein. Bushire, June 22, 1894. With reference to the correspondence between you and the residency agent, Shargah, regarding the salvage claimed by the people of the Island of Abu Musa for rescuing the boat of a Bahrein subject, by name Mohamed-bin-Saleh-bin-Jebara, I enclose a letter I have addressed the Shargah agent on the subject, which please transmit to him after perusal. Appendix 3. Residency Agent, Shargah, to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. April 14, 1907. I beg to state that the chief officer of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company’s steam-ship “Bulimba” came to me on the 1st April, 1907, reporting that the steamer had stranded on the Bu Island and asking me to notify the Shargah merchants to send lighters to Bu Musa for the purpose of landing the cargoes they had [920] L “on board her. I notified the merchants accordingly. The officer then proceeded to Debai to meet the ship’s agent, Mohamed-bin-Ibrahim, and arrange for the dispatch of lighters to Bu Musa. I was informed by the officer that the islanders had not agreed to render the vessel any assistance unless they received half the cargo. The agent, Mohamed Ibrahim, having asked me for assistance to be rendered to the steamer, I sent with him my brother, Maaraj-bin-Abdul Rahman, to Bu Musa lest the islanders may do something irregular towards the ship’s crew and the cargo, which it may be desirable to discharge on the island in order to launch the vessel. I took likewise a letter from the Chief of Shargah to the islanders ordering them to refrain from raising objections against the ship’s crew 7 , and to give them such help as they can. However, by God’s grace and the company’s good fortune, the sea remained calm and waveless while the vessel was stranded until arrangements were made for launching her. According to Maaraj’s report to me, His Majesty’s ship “ Highflyer ” had visited Bu Musa just as the stranded vessel was being launched. Thank God nothing unpleasant occurred in the vessel’s stranding, but if a storm had taken place she would have incurred some damage having stranded on hard rock. Appendix 4 Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Assistant Resident, Bunder Abbas. British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, March 1, 1905. I have the honour to reply to your letter of the 14th Februarv, 1905, resrardinor salvage fees. I would first observe that the usual local custom is for the Nakhuda of a boat in distress to apply to the local authorities or people for assistance and to agree with them on the amount of salvage money. If the vessel is in serious danger, the persons rendering assistance claim half the value of the goods salved, a procedure sanctioned by local usage, but this residency has refused to recognise that they have any absolute right to demand such a share in the absence of agreement with the Nakhuda of the vessel. Local customs in this matter, as in others, depend more on “ might ” than “ right,” and efforts are always made to mulct the owners arid Nakhodas of vessels as much as possible. , Appendix 5. Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khaled-bin-Sultan to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox. (Translation.) _ ... Shargah, 23rd Rabi 1, 1329 {March 25, 1911). After compliments and enquiries afeer your health, I beg to address you in regard, to your enquiry regarding the undermentioned three points connected with the Abu Musa case : T on say that it is claimed that on the 12th Shaaban, 1316, after my return from He Hajj, Sheikh Salim granted to three persons an agreement for the extraction of mica from Bu Musa Island without any permission from me, and you enquire from me that if I was aware of the same, how was it that I did not mention this agreement to you on the 19th Moharram, 1326, when I presented to you a statemeift of my relations with Sheikh Salim in regard to the Bu Musa Island. 2. \ou also mention to me the question of jetsam and flotsam on the Bu Musa Island, and state that it is claimed that Sheikh Salim v T as receiving the income on this account; and 3. You have also shown me the translation of a paper which is claimed to be dated the 4th Zilkhadeh, 1315, and to be the first draft of the oxide contract which was altered to another form on the 18th Zilkhadeh, 1315.39 This is my reply with regard to three points :— Firstly, in regard to the mica agreement, I was fully aware of it, and Sheikh Salim consulted me [about it] and it would not have been possible that the said agreement could be issued without coming to my knowledge as ruling chief. But as I informed you two years ago, I had left to Sheikh Salim all the income which he could obtain from the aforesaid island, and consequently I did not trouble [myself] to object to this [agreement]. At the same time, when I presented to you the said statement regarding my relations with Sheikh Salim in respect of Bu Musa, the question of this mica contract did not occur to my mind at all, for, as you must be aware, the mica affair produced no result whatever. As regards the sum of 1,500 dollars, payable by instalments, to Sheikh Salim, I have no information as to how many instalments were •received by Sheikh Salim. I did not trouble to make enquiries about the instalments, nor did I demand anything from Sheikh Salim on that account. It was my wish that he should get something from it, and that he should not trouble me about his expenses. Secondly, as regards the right to jetsam and flotsam on Bu Musa Island and all the Islands of Kowasim, it is not open to doubt that it is due to the chief of the Kowasim, but the usual custom on the Oman coast is that the inhabitants of the place exact their rights on the scene of the wreck, and when the chief comes to know of it he settles the matter according to his own opinion ; sometimes he takes his own share r* from his subjects und sometimes he does not take from them. In the case of Bu Musa, as I had left all the revenue to Sheikh Salim, I treated my right of jetsam and flotsam as a part of the income to go to him and used to ask no questions about it. 1 hirdly, with regard to the rejected draft of the oxide agreement, I have now noted its wording, but had neither seen nor heard of it before. The reason for its rejection is obviously because Sheikh Salim could not write about Bu Musa in these terms, namely, “So long as I, my children, and my brothers live, no one is entitled to raise objection to it.” No doubt this was the cause of the draft being changed. This is what was necessary to be stated, and salaams ! (L.S.) SAGAB-BIN-KHALED-BIN-SULTAN. Appendix 6. Form I.

Bote by Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif giving history of the rejected Preliminary Draft of the Oxide Concession and explaining the reason of its rejection. With reference to the translation which you have shown to me of what purports to be a rejected preliminary draft, dated the 6th April, 1898, of the oxide concession executed on the 10th April, 1898, I beg to make the following observations :— I note that the document purports to be signed by (l) Hassan-bin-Ahmed and (2) Ali Ahmed Saleh. * J w \ ) [926] M^ The Hassan-bin-Ahmed mentioned was a retainer of Sheikh Salim. Ali Ahmed Saleh is the man whose identity you know as Nakhoda Ali. I had nothing to do with the writing or draft ing of this document. 1 remember that I had been absent on duty at Bushire during the spring of the year in question, and it was on my return to Shargah that the project for an oxide concession was discussed. The draft had been drawn up by Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh, and it was he who showed it to me. At the same time he and Nakhoda Ali, who was also there, asked me to let my son Isa come into the concern as they needed soine one on the spot at Shargah in order to keep in touch with Sheikhs Sagar and Salim. 1 agreed, but pointed out that the terms of the proposed concession as at present drafted were quite impossible, and that neither Sheikh Sagar would confirm it nor would the Government approve it. What I especially objected to was (1) the sentence in which Sheikh Salim is made to say : “ so long as I, my children, and my brothers live, no one will be entitled to raise objection to it,” and (2) the inclusion of Nakhoda Ali as a signatory on the document. With regard to (1), I would explain that Salim was an old man of 70, who might be expected to die at any time, and I was taking into account the fact that if he died, we should thenceforth have to deal with Sheikh Sagar. As regards (2) I thought the inclusion of Nakhoda Ali was inexpedient, as I had just been visiting Bushire and knew him to be in very bad odour with the residency in connection with his Bushire affairs, and he was a^o at loggerheads with the wel'-known Muin-ut-Tujjar of Tehran, holder of the Hormuz concession, and 1 feared the latter would be likely to give us trouble if he came to know that Nakhoda Ali was a partner in a rival oxide enterprise. I also omitted the twenty-year time limit, as 1 saw no object in inserting any fixed period of time. ABDUL LATIF-BIN-ABDUItBAHMAN. March 25, 1911. Appendix 10. A ote by Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif on the reference to a Dispute between Sheikhs Sagar and Salim regarding Sir Abu Nuair Island {made in his letter of the 27th Jamadi II, 1316 {November 14, 1898). Your honour enquires from me to what I referred in my letter dated the 27th Jamadi II, 1316, when I wrote the following sentence :— “ As regards Sir a dispute has arisen between Sheikhs Sagar and Salim. It is Sagar s intention to lease without mentioning Salim’s name and to give some advantage to Salim, but Salim would not agree to this.” The explanation of the above passage is as follows :—- It will be remembered that in the second agreement between Sheikh Sao-ar and Sheikh Salim (dated 1884), at which my predecessor was the intermediary, Sheikh Sagar granted to Sheikh Salim an annual pension of 400 dollars together with the revenue of Sir Bu Nuair, which was expected to bring in some 200 dollars. Up to 1889, however, this island did not produce any revenue as was expected and consequently no mention was made of it in the third agreement dated the 5th Shaaban, 1306 (1889), and Sheikh Salim ceased to take any interest in it. When however, it became probable that the island might produce some revenue as the result of the concession alluded to in my letter to Hassan Samieh now under reference Sheikh Salim’s interest was naturally revived and he wanted to claim the revenue under the obsolete agreement of 1884, which Sheikh Sagar was altogether unwilling to agree to on the ground that under the last agreement (1889), which was now in force, the revenue of Sir Bu Nuair Island was not an item of the settlement. The sheikhs failed to come to an understanding on this point, with the result that the project for the concession fell through. This is what had to be represented ABDUL LATIF-BIN-ABDUL RAHMAN.

Amongst the conditions for the validity of a lease are the specifications and necord of the period of the lease. Supposing, for instance, he were to say, “ I have let the house at the rate of 1 toman per mensem,” such a lease is legally null and void, and if the lessee says a prayer in such a house the prayer will be futile. And as to this question there is no difference of opinion between the distinguished ulemas, and God is aware of His precepts. Written by the humble Mohamed Ali-el-Moosevi-ed-Dehdasty-en-Nejafi. (L.S.) The hopeful Mohamed Ali-el-Moosevi. (Note .—The most venerable Shia Mullah in Bushire.) 4. It should be understood that the conditions for the validity of a lease are six, oy the absence of any of which six conditions the lease is null and void. The first [is] the compact, i.e., the proposal and acceptance, intended to indicate the fact of the assumption of the profit for a fixed period in return for something specific. Secondly, the legality of the possession. Thirdly, the taking cognizance of the rent or the measure or weight or number. Fourthly, the specification of the profit by time or by [926] Nthe job. Fifthly, the retention of the profit in possession or its coming under that category [of possession]. Sixthly, the defining of the period of the lease in such a manner that it shall become neither less nor more. The subject-matter of the question [under reply], being void of certain of the conditions, namely, the compact and the period, and the cognizance of the amount of the profit, is not valid, and God is aware of the truth of affairs. Written by the humble Abdullah-el-Moosevi-el-Baladi (L.S.) (Note.—The chief mullah of the Ussuli sect of Shias in Bushire.) 5. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Ihe distinguished ulemas—may their blessings amongst the people endure— have defined lease to be the taking possession of an ascertained profit in return for something specific. So whatever is like giving possession of original property, for instance by selling it, is a thing extraneous to a compact of lease, and so is anything in w hich the profit is not defined, either in itself—such as by the act of sewing of a certain garment or the riding of a certain animal to a certain place—or by the fixing of a period such as a full year. And thus, as regards the subject of the question, whereas, it is not a case of taking possession of a profit, but of the original property and, whereas, the piofit is not fixed by either of the two methods aforesaid, the lease is accordingly null and \ oid, on both counts, and it is obvious that while there is no contradiction in the said two rulings, it is recorded that the majority set store by the last. And God is aware of His Commands. Written by this humble servant of the Shera, Murteza-el-Moosevi, Sadr-el-Islam. (L.S.) (Note .—Seyyid Murteza-el-Moosevi is the stipendiarv “ Sadr-el-Islam,” of Bushire much respected for his piety.) 6. Praise be to God. This lease as it is written is null and void and is not valid. The conditions for the lease, viz., the formula of proposal and acceptance and the stipulation of the time are not (made) therein, further, if the mines are open, they cannot be turned into property and the lease is not proper. this, and God the Highest knows more.

How is it now that (several) conditions are omitted ? The first is that a lease requires bond such as proposal and acceptance; and the second of the conditions thereof is that it should be for a known period. So this, which is written in the question, should be nullified for several reasons, and it cannot be valid in this condition which is stated. And God knows more. ABDUL KERIM-BIN-AHMED (Servant of the august law, at Keis, by his own hand).48 }5. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Praise be to God, Who leads to the right. The said lease is invalid and illegal in several respects and does not contain all the conditions. The first of the reasons for its invalidity is that the period of the lease is unspecified. The second reason is that the formula of the lease has not been pronounced therein. The third reason is that, legally speaking, the right to any ground rent, in the manner mentioned in the question, is unknown (i.e., inadmissible) from all points of view. To take interest on unknown articles for an unknown period, and to compare it to rent is unlawful. In short, this lease, as quoted in the question, according to “ the following copy,” is not compatible with the precepts of the august Shera law. And God knows best.

As put to the Members of the Clergy. Jn the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. To the learned ulemas and distinguished lawyers. May God multiply the like pf them! As regards a deed of lease which has been given by a certain party to another, and in which, owing to the absence of the specification of the time and the non-pronun ciation of the legal formula, the learned lawyers and Islamic divines have, in accordance with the rules of the Sacred Shera of Islam, issued and recorded a judgment nullifying the lease, can the lessor, who is the owner of the property, cancel it and turn the lessee out of his property ? It is requested that you will record the true position in accordance with the precepts of the Sacred Law of Islam and adorn and seal it with your august seal Please explain and be rewarded, your reward being with God. Here follows copy of the said lease (an imaginary one) as under:— lu the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Let all know who may see this. I, Mohammad-bin-Abdullah-bin-Hassan have leased all the mines situated in the island of Kaem to the following persons : Haji Yakoob-bin-Mohamed-bin-Saleh, Abdul Kerim Mohammad, and Seyyid Sadek-bin-AIi from this date for so long as they have a disposition (to work) in the aforesaid mine. They are to pay us 150 French dollars for every year. I have likewise agreed with them that if they wish to ship dried and fresh dates for trading purposes at the place mentioned, they are to pay us 150 French dollars as warehouse fee; and we have autho rised them to dig well for drinking-water for their employes working in the aforesaid mine, and friendly assistance is to be given by us to their employes who work on the mine. It is possible that I may have concluded agreements before this present one, but they are not to be acted upon, and this agreement, which is written in duplicate, holds good.

Note by Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif with reference to the Memorandum of Rides of Partnership, purporting to be dated 2ftth Shaaban, 1316 (January 9, 1S99), and on which Hassan Samieh bases his title to represent the Company. March 25, 1911. The history of the paper purporting to be the rules of partnership is as follows:— The drawing up of the original draft was done by me, the reason being that the oxide mining work had been in operation for nearly a year without any definite plan of operations having been arrived at. I was anxious to put the work on a more business like footing, and therefore drew up some rules and sent them to Hassan. The latter made certain additions and had five documents drawn up including the additions and signed by himself, Abdullah, and Nakhoda Ali, and he forwarded them all to me for completion by the attachment of the signatures of Sheikh Sagar and myself. When completed I was to return three of them to him, one for himself, one for Abdullah, and one 'for Nakhoda Ali. Of the remaining two I was to give one to Sheikh Sagar and keep one myself. I did not, however, care about the extra condition which he had inserted and wrote back and said so. There the matter ended. These deeds were never completed nor were any revised documents drawn up. I never showed them to Sheikh Sagar, and produce them now in the state in which I received them. These rules never having become operative, Esa and I always considered and presumed that the document on which the concern was carried on was that of Zilhijjeh, 1315, in which Nakhoda Ali was admitted to partnership, and in which it is laid down that the sale, loading, and shipping should be carried out with the knowledge of all the partners. By reason of Hassan’s neglect to consult us properly, and his failure to render any accounts, we became dissatisfied with his conduct of affairs. Appendix 16. Translation of Deed admitting Mr. T. J. Malcolm into partnership, dated loth Shaaban, 1316 (December 27, 1898). In the name of God the Highest. W r e do agree and take upon ourselves, Hassan-bin-Ali Samieh, Abdullah*bin- Hassan, Isa-bin-Abdul Latif, Yusuf bin Abdullah and Ali Ahmed Saleh, that we have admitted amongst us Mr. Tigrane Malcolm in the company for the oxide and mica mines in the Bu Musa Island, which we have leased from Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan at 250 dollars per annum for the oxide mines, and 1,500 dollars for a five years’ period on account of the mica mines, on the condition that he will use endeavours in disposing of and shipping what is excavated from the said mines in steamers from Bu Musa to other countries for sale, and afford full assistance for the non-Stoppage of the work on the said mines. And whatever the said expenses may amount to, they will be borne by all the parties, and the profits will also be (divided) proportionately amongst all. And on this (understanding) the agreement is concluded; so that it may not be hidden.52 And it is not open to any one of the partners to sell his share or to admit any one (therein; except in consultation with hfaji Hassan-bin-Ah Samieh, and with his signature, together with those of the partners Dated 13th Shaaban, 131G.

Statement of Mr. T. J. Malcolm. MR. TIGRANE MALCOLM appears before me this 30th day of May, 1911, and makes the following statement:— “ T ^ e history of my entry into the Abu Musa oxide concern was as follows :— I had been for some years connected with the trade in oxide from Hormuz in association with Lakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh, in whose name the concession then was. lie, however, lost the concession and then, in consultation with me, he set to work to obtain a concession for extracting Abu Musa oxide, having first made a trial shipment. It was .Nakhoda Ah who first started the Abu Musa mining, Hassan Sameiyeh knew nothing about the oxide trade until Nakhoda Ali introduced him to it. The latter had at this time a very bad name with the local authorities and in commercial circles in the Gulf ports, and so he found it convenient to work through Hassan Sameiyeh. “ After securing the Abu Musa concession the parties thought it would be to their advantage to bring me into it with a view to my arranging the shipments to Europe and elsewhere, and so I came into it. Nakhoda Ah w^as the moving spirit in the acquiring of the concession, Hassan Sameiyeh was only used as a screen. The former was in charge of the mining work and always complained greatly of the obstructiveness of Abdullah Sameiyeh and his father Hassan, and their ignorance of matters connected with the oxide trade. Owing, however, to his own state of bankruptcy Nakhoda Ali could not take a prominent part in the concern, and so Abdullah and Hassan gradually began to dominate it. Nakhoda Ah managed the work on the island, I was expected to manage the sales and shipment to Europe, and Hassan acted as corresponding member of the company. P ar ^ cu ^ r basis of authority existed, so far as I kn ow, on which Hassan was ent'tled to act, and to the best of my belief (and I have an J ’excellent memory) I have never heard of or seen the so-called memorandum of association which you have now shown me, much less did I ever sign it or receive a copy of it. “ Nor was I consulted at all or informed regarding the sale of a share in the concern by Sheikh Sagar to 1 usuf-bin-Abdullah, or by Yusuf to Hassan, or Hassan to Brown ; it is all news to me. “ In any case, Hassan Sameiyeh never acted according to the rules now shown to me. He has never rendered any accounts at all. In fact, the mismanagement of the Sameiyehs and the extravagance of Abdullah have always been a great cause of complaint both to me and Nakhoda Ali.” Bushire, May 30, 1911. T. J. MALCOLM.

Therefore, in order to settle the afiairs 1 have written in your name a special power in the case of oxide and our d,sprite with Sassoon [saying] that what we now arrange with Sassoon for settlement by compiomise is agreed upon by you. ^ I intended sending the power by registered post by this mail.but it was not ready. This is for your information, and, God wiling it will reach you by registered post next mail. You should act upon the instructions which I will now explain to you \\ hen you receive the power, you should take it to the resident or British vice- consu and assistant resident at Bunder Abbas.

You should forward it soon and avoid procrastination and delay and you should send it to me by iegistered post to Calcutta soon and without delay. On the same day when it reaches you, you should take it to the resident or the assistant who is now present at Bunder Abbas. I have written you th.s letter by this mail so that you niy know that you receive the power by registered post. 1 am sending you this letter in my father’s letter and have forwarded another letter to you by post. Surely I will write you by the next mail also with the power. ^ LUt5 Your letters to me should continue without interruption as before when Haii Ali continuously kept me informed of the situation and of the reports. This is what was necessary to he said at present. God willing, I will settle matters after the receipt of the power and proceed to your side in Shavval.

I am further told that Nejef had declined to give Samieh the required declaration. ^ ^ J ea xo57 Appendix 21. / V Affidavit of Nejef-bin-Nakhoda Ali, dated March 19, 1910. Nejef-bin-Haji Nakhoda Ali states on solemn affirmation :— I solemnly declare the following to be the facts regarding my interviews with Mr. Thomas Brown, of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., and, if necessary, I am prepared to confirm this statement by oath on the Koran before a mujtehed. I have had several conversations about the Abu Musa case with parties interested. The first was when Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh came to see me accompanied by Mirza Hussein “ Germani.” They came to Bunder Abbas and stayed in the house of Haji Amin-ut Tujjar. Abdullah, on landing from the ship, came to my house and asked me to come over and have a talk about the matter at Haji Amin’s house. I went over to Haji Amin’s house, and there Mirza Hussein, Abdullah, and Haji Ali “Germani” were present. Abdullah asked me to give him a paper stating that I handed over my share of the concession on Abu Musa to Abdullah-bin-Hassan. The paper was to be given a date prior to the date of the contract between Messrs. Wonckhaus and Hassan. He also asked me to give him another paper saying that I was quite satisfied with the contract. 1 refused, saying that I would not do anything of the sort unless they settled up my account with David Sassoon, that is, my father’s, on account of oxide, carpets, &amp;c. I said if they did not give me back the carpets they should pay me 20,000 rupees and settle my account, and then 1 would give them the paper. However, they did not give me the money, and I mentioned the matter to the British consulate. These two persons came to Bunder Abbas not long after the British consul, Lieutenant Gabriel, returned there from a trip he made to Shargah, &amp;c. Some months later Mr. Brown came to Bunder Abbas. The exact date can be ascertained from the consul, * Bunder Abbas, as I reported the matter to him at the time, but it was just about two &gt; years ago. Mr. Brown had two interviews with me, once at the house of Jamshidian’fr i agent and once at the custom-house. At the first interview Agha Ghulam Ali Khorassani was present, at the second Mr. Moses Khan, the customs director. Agha Ghulam Ali is agent of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. Mr. Brown had a long talk with me. Before beginning to talk about Abu Musa he dismissed two Hindoos, Gulshan and Asanand Ghulab. Mr. Brown asked me why I had not signed the paper shown me by Abdullah and Mirza Hussein. I said there appeared to he no advantage for me in doing so, and therefore I hadn’t. Mr Brown said he had bought the share in the oxide company belonging to Sheikh Sagar for 250 reals. I replied that Sheikh Sagar had never made anything out of the business, and so would sell cheap. Mr. Brown said he wanted to buy my share, and said that lie would settle up all my accounts with Hassan- bin-Ali and Abdullah. I never offered to sell my share to Mr. Brown. In fact, as I reported to the consulate at the time, Mr. ^rowrT’offered to buy my share. I would swear to this on the Koran. This took place in the presence of Agha Ghulam Ali Khorassani. At the second interview, and after Mr. Moses Khan tried to persuade me to go to Lingah to settle with Mr. Biown, he continued to endeavour to make me do this for a long time, and, on my refusing, he got annoyed with me, and worried me to such an extent that I finally had to resign my post as Hamal Bashi at Bunder Abbas.

Linga.h, 2-iih Zilkedah, 1322 (January 30, 1905). I have read your letter of the 12th instant (19th January, 1905) with pleasure, and understood its contents. During my. interview with you we held a conversation about the visit to Abu Musa Island of Wonckhaus, the German, and you said you heard it was in connection with the lease of that island, and you warned me not to let him approach me. Please note that the fact is this as I informed you, that Wonckhaus visited the island merely to inspect the oxide, saying that if he approved (the oxide) he would perhaps com municate with me with regard to the price, and would probably buy some. This was his object. You should not think that I would fail to let you know if he communi cated with me on the subject which you indicate. We could not allow this sort of interference from any one, especially on the part of these persons. You may rest assured. On seeing the oxide he approved that from one of the mines and returned to Lingah, and says that he will perhaps buy 300 tons if he obtains reasonable rates of freight. He left for Bushire some time ago, and has opened a branch there for the transaction of business. Hassan Samieh to Abdul Latif. (After compliments.) Lingah, 12th Jumadi I, 1324 (July 5, 190G). Your esteemed letter, dated Rabi ul Thani, reached me in due course, and 1 understood what you said. In particular regarding the receipt by you of my letter and your comprehension of its purport with reference to our transaction with the German. Irish Allah it will turn out well. You told me to take care that he did not get any bond from me (which would enable him) to enter the island. Set your mind69 at rest, I, your brother, am knowledgable and well versed in matters of business, and am far from acting in such a way as you indicate. He has not the presumption to make overtures to me in that direction. For, just as I told you, he is only a purchaser of the oxide itself, nothing more. Whether it be he or someone else, whoever wants to buy the oxide from me, if the price suits me I shall sell it. Do not let any idea beyond this enter your head. You may rest assured. (Letter goes on to speak of other matters.) Appendix 24. The Rev. S. M. Z t wemer to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox. ( Bahrein, May 29, 1911. With reference to the meaning of the Arabic sentence and the probable intention of the writer in using those words concerning which point you asked my opinion, T take pleasure in replying as follows :— First, it is evident that whoever wrote the sentence was not a thorough scholar in Arabic,.as he confused the masculine and feminine forms in the last word of the sentence. To my mind the obvious translation of the phrase is, “ the annulment of this agreement is better than its acceptance.” I do not think it is at all obvious or possible to translate the sentence “ the annulment of this agreement is better than to comply with (his wishes).” This translation is, to my mind, a forced one, and not the natural significance of the words in question, whatever be their connection. I am confirmed in this opinion after consulting with one or two Arabs concerning the popular use of the pronoun in such a sentence, and I find that they agree with me that there is a great looseness in the use of the feminine or masculine pronoun at the close of a clause or sentence. I am sure that nine out of ten Arabs would give the preference to the former translation of the sentence as the obvious and natural intention of the writer. Although my opinion does not carry weight beyond that of others who have a speaking and reading knowledge of Arabic, yet I feel confident that in this case it is not a matter of expert grammatical opinion, but ot everyday usage in the Persian Gulf, and I have no hesitation in saying that the first translation is the right one. Appendix 25. Note hy Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif on the meaning of the doubtful ‘passage in his Letter to Uassan Samieh, dated 8th Zilhejjeh, 1324 (January 22&gt;, 1907). I beg to refer to the sentence in my letter dated 8th Zilbijjeh, 1324 (23rd January, 1907), which runs as follows :— ,wc iikJS) tJllaJuudl and about the meaning of which there have been arguments. I beg to say that my meaning when I wrote the sentence was :— (“ The annulment of this agreement is better than the acceptance of this agreement.”) It is not hidden from your Honour that I received my education in the Gulf, and that I am not an expert in the niceties of grammar and the shades of meaning of various measures of words. When I write, I write according to the usages and under standing of the community in which I live.60 As regards tlie use of the measure JlkjJLJ* as synonymous with Jlh.*', the “desire to” here. Again, you will note that in the letter from my son Isa, dated 7th Moharram, 1325 (20th February, 1907), to Sheikh Sagar occurs the sentence:— Furthermore, when writing to me on the 23rd Moharram with reference to my letter to him (dated 8th Zilhejjeh, 1324) enjoining on him the ^hliUh is* JlkjuLA , ^j y Hassan used the same form of words as I had, thus :— what you said, namely, that your son Isa was not agreeable to the execution of a docu ment of this purport for the reason that I had not consulted you and that it was necessary that the partners should not enter [into transaction] without the knowdedge (“ The annulment of this contract is better than its acceptance.”) Again, in writing to me on 15th Safar, 1325 (30th March, 1907), Hassan suggested that 1 had better, if I thought fit, write to the German myself and explain to him regarding the annulment of the contract. His precise words were :— that Hassan understood me fully in the sense I intended to convey. Secondly, the explanation of the use of the spelling is as follows in my opinion :— It is rendering into writing of a colloquial construction of speech. Thus, in conversation, if referring to a masculine object, such as “ zaid,” I should not say , but jlUUlLT, leaving out the “ zamah ” after the “ h,” but substi tuting the “zamah” for “ kasrob ” after the “t.” Similarly, if I were referring to a feminine object I should not say but &lt;u^uL»T, substituting the “ kasrah ” after the “ t ” for the feminine pronoun “ ha.” Likewise, in writing a colloquial letter I should render the above sounds into writing. I he word c_A?-b or is constantly used, in my parlance, in reference to a thing in the sense of It is also evident from Hassan Samieh’s reply above quoted that he uses it in this (“ Better than its acceptance,” i.e., better than the acceptance of the contract.) The pronoun is used in the feminine, and could only refer to the contract. A BDUL LATIF-BIN-ABDURRAHMAN. use is quite an ordinary one in these parts, and I can mention many other instances of the same, such as U-bJLA (“reposing”), (“continuance”), c_&gt;hAaA (“being ruined”), (“advancing”), &lt;uUJLA (“remaining”). There is no idea of a document.”) This shows that the words and JlkylA were used synonymously. (“ Va atlub min jenabekum almosaadeh fi naqz va istebtal-i-hazehel varaqah.”) (“ And I beg your Honour for assistance in the breaking up and annulling of this “ You particularly wrote about the deed of contract which I executed with Wonckhaus, the German, for the sale of oxide from Abu Musa Island.

(After compliments.) 23rd Moharrum, 1325 (March 8, 1907). Your letter dated Zilhijjeh 1324 reached me m due course, and I was glad to receive it and understand its contents. You particularly wrote about the deed of contract which I executed with Wdnckhaus, the German, for the sale of oxide frorn Abu Musa Island. You said that your son Esa did not agree to the execution of document of such a nature, and complained that I did not consult you, although it was necessary that no partner entered into transactions without the knowledge of the other partners; that I had so entered into transactions without consultation ; and that, as Esa feared that complications would result owing to the entry of foreigners into the matter, the nullification of the contract was better than its acceptance. I under stood it all. Oh ! my brother, at the time I executed the deed of agreement I communicated to you the details of it, copied in Arabic alongside the English without addition or omission, and you came to know of it and approved it, and wrote to me in reply that it was all right. Similarly you asked me for a copy of the deed, and I sent it you, and you acknowledged its receipt and approved of it. It is now a matter of eight months. How can I cancel it ? You, by the grace of God, are a wise man, and if you suggest complications. Remember, the German has no connection with the leasehold of the mines; he has no concern except to take from us the oxide itself, nothing further, for a stated period. There is no harm in this. The object is to effect sales and the stuff be sold whether to him or to any one else. You are aware that he took some from us last year, and we saw nothing objectionable in his deal with us; and, as you know, we have spent a considerable sum of money in expenses in this connection. If we do not sell the stuff how are we to get back our own ? Please God, the matter will end satisfactorily ! Salaams to Esa and the brothers. Appendix 27. Esa-bin-Abdul Latif to Sheikh Sagar-bin-Kalid. (After compliments.) 8th Moharrum, 1325 (February 20, 1907). I HAVE to communicate with your honour with reference to the lease which I and two partners acquired from the Government of Shargah relating to the extraction of red oxide from your island of Abu Musa. As your honour is aware, the document of lease was drawn up in the names of three persons, namely, your humble servant Esa-bin- Abdul Latif, Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh, and Abdulla-bin-11 assan Samaiyeh. 1 have come to know that on the 1st June, 1906 (8th Rabi-ul-Thani, 1324), the said Haji Hassan entered into a contract with a European merchant named Wonckhaus, without consulting me, and that according to the terms of the document he bound him self and his partners in giving an absolute monopoly for the extraction of the red oxide for a period of four years. And the said Haji Hassan executed this agreement and bound himself without consulting me previous to the drawing of the deed of contract. The details of the said deed have only now reached me, and I do not agree to the terms of this contract. Accordingly I forward to your honour a copy of the deed of contract for you to examine ; kindly look into it. I beg from your honour assistance in taking the necessary steps for the cancellation and annulment of this contract, for I am altogether unwilling to agree to this lease. Previous to this I have written to Haji Hassan Samaiyeh expressing my disagreement to this contract, but he has sent me no answer. Finally, I am obliged to call your attention to the deed of contract, the beginning of which is as follows :— “ Contract between Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh, of Lingah, owner and holder ol the Abu Musa Concession, and M. Robert Wonckhaus, of Lingah. ’ [926] R62 Now Haji Hassan Samaiyeh has no deed of authority from me giving him any general power in regard to action which he might take respecting the lease, &amp;c. ; how then has Haji Hassan the right thus to mention himself only, without consulting or referring to his partners, of whom I am one ? 1 am . in consequence obliged to make a complaint on the subject to your honour, and it is for your honour to issue orders. Appendix 28. Statement of Gulum Hassan. Gulum Hassan states on solemn affirmation :— I have been living on Abu Musa as caretaker of twelve or fifteen years. The following are the circumstances under which shots were fired by Sheikh Sugar’s guards in connection with the arrival of Abdalla-bin-Hassan Samayieh in a “ boom ” (pattern of native craft) from Lingah. The vessel arrived about noon and dropped anchor off the spot where the oxide is shipped from about SOO yards to the westward of the heaps on the seashore. A jolly-boat full of people put off from her after she had anchored, and came towards the shore. At this time there were only ten or fifteen men present out of Sheikh Sugar’s guard ; the rest were over at the villageT ’^Some of those present were now on the seashore in front of the oxide heaps and some above them on the rocks at the side. Those on shore shouted to the people in the boat not to approach, but as she came on one or two shots were fired from the rocks near the big oxide heap. They were not / tired at the boat or dhow but in the air. Tiie German was in the boat, and at the time one Haji Ali, whom I understand to be the German’s clerk, was standing up in the bows of the boat ready to jump off as the boat neared the shore, but I myself called out to him, “ Don’t attempt to land, as there is no permission for it.” I heard no answer. Then the guards on the shore called out, “ If you want to ask or see anything send a man ashore, he can see and go back ” Two negroes, whose names I do not know, then jumped into the water and swam ashore. They only remained a few minutes. They were led up to the huts where Sheikh Abdulla-bin-Ahmed bin-Sultan was—he was in charge of the guard from Shurgah—and they asked him what was the position of affairs and why had the shots been fired. He replied, “We are ordered not to let anyone land ; if you don’t like it go and get permission from Sheikh Sagar.” They then returned to the boat and the boat to the boom. As the dhow did not show any signs of departing the guard feared she might be intending to stay till dark and try and effect a landing, so about 4 p.m. they began shouting to the dhow, warning her to be off. At this time there were waves and some surf. Soon afterwards, I being in the huts at the time, I heard three or four shots fired by our men, but I did not see what at. The dhow then, I believe, moved from her place and went farther round to the right, but I did not see any more of her myself. Dated Abu Musa, February 17, 1908. gardens and flocks for the last 4, fak — ^ Statement of Mattur-bin-Shamhan. V Mattur-bin-Shamhan states on solemn affirmation :— I was one of the guard which Sheikh Sagar sent over to Abu Musa and was present on the occasion when shots were fired in connection with the presence there of a dho’w from Lingah. The dhow arrived about noon and anchored opposite the oxide heaps on the shore. The guards who had gone over from Shargah were about eighty in all. Of these about thirty were present at the oxide heaps when the boom arrived. After she had ancTidred a rowing-boat put from her containing about ten persons. As they got near we recognised Abdalla-bin-Samayieh and a native clerk of the Germans, who was, known by sight to s'on'iU uf ■im»i I did not notice the German himself. .Aki ^T h - n rj 6 SaW some °f us called out, “Don’t come near, don’t come near, ~ d;illa. He merely answered by calling out and gesticulating to Jiis boatmen to row harder. We shouted, “ We will fire at you if you attempt to approach.” Abdalla then said to his rowers, “Don’t mind what they say, they will not shoot.” We repeated that we would fire. He replied, “Fire away.” We then fired four shots in the air over their heads. I did not fire myself. We should have fired straight at them had not Sheikh Abdalla-bin-Ahmed, who was in charge of us, given us orders (which he sent through me) to fire in the air. Oil our firing they turned back a little and called out to us, “What is this all about l Vv e replied, “ If you want to get news, send two men ashore. On that they sent two negroes (one named Salim), who jumped into the water and swam ashore. Ihey said, “ Why do you stop us from coming ashore, seeing that the island belongs to the German and Hassin-bin-Samayieh ? ” We replied, “The island belongs to Sheikh Sagar.’ I he negroes said that Abdalla-bin-Hassan had not told the German that, and from what they said it appeared that they had brought him, the German, on false pretences. After this conversation we told them they must return to the boom ; and we warned them that if the boom did not depart before sundown we should have to fire on her. They then went off to her. 1 he boom did not move, however, and we feared that after nightfall she might endeavour to make a landing. Accordingly Abdulla-bin-Hamed told three of the guard to go to the clifl and fire some shots. They, however, fired six shots above the boom. It was not intended that they should fire at the boom ; as a matter of fact, I did hear cue s hot strike her, or strike something other than the water. The man who fired that shTit was Abdurrahim-bin-Saif, of the Holi tribe, who let off his rifle before getting it to his shoulder. After this the boom weighed anchor and got off just at sunset, but they only moved a little way and anchored again opposite the mud enclosure farther up. Four of us then went along the shore parallel and stayed there until three hours after sunset (about 9 P.M.). Then seeing that they were apparently intending to pass the night there, our men fired two more shots in the air above the dhow. She then took her departure. Our object was to frighten the visitors away. Dated Shargah, 21st February, 1908.Sa eng an Segger ( v r Si.^ztruar 190c.

My dear Mr. Eisenhut, Replying to your communication of a few days since in which you ask me to define an Arabic sentence, I wish to report as follows: ^ jO- I. JiklA is the Masdar of the X th conjugation of the root The verb Jk is an intransitive verb signifying to be repealed, to be abolished. The second conjugation Jk on the measure makes the verb transitive, and the Masdar (German infinitivus) indicates nullification, abolition, repeal. The fourth measure Jki (J^i) likewise makes the intransitive verb transitive. It is the function of the X th conjugation to impart to the II and IV mea sures the significance of a desire to, an asking to, a seeking to, a con sidering and occasionally imparts rellexhe meaning. Vide Palmer s Arabic Grammar p. 31. Vide Socin’s Arabic Grammar, Berlin 1895, p. 29 § 26. Cf. also jkL-l Ac. Cf. also the standard Arabic dictionary Qatr el Muhit in loco. Jlki-I signifies “a desire or request to nullify, or abolish. II. UjUil root JS to say, speak. The form iij 1 ^ means a conference, a conversation, dispute, Sc. Then by derivation an agreement, but usually a verbal agreement. For a written agreement would be properly used, though there is locally in Basrah some looseness in the use of this word. HI. ^ from the root jk meaning to be good, to be mercifu . &gt; signifies better, preferable with no implication of compulsion except that of a moral obligation.(g) 254 A propos de votre explication de 1 1 emploi de 1'ex pression 'c'est la compagnie miniere Sec ' dans votre lettbe du 19 aout 1909 et de 1 * observation dans votre lettre du 14 Janvier ecoule / qu'il ne s‘agissait pas,cette fois-ci, d*une expedition par Messieurs Wonckhaus et Cie,je tiens a vous faire remarquer que les dispositions a prendre dans le propos actuel auraient e'te beaucoup simplifie'es si vous m*aviez averti de facon explicite au debut de notre correspondance:- I- Que Messieurs Fonckhaus et Cie s * etaient deja acquittes par 1*expedition dans le vapeur 'Louise* de leurs obligations contractees preWdeminent a 1 *egard de l , ox 3 .rde,et 2- que vous ne vous interessiez actuellement qu’au profit de Hadji Hassan Samaiyeh. Or,Hadji Hassan Samaiyeh,en sujet britannique,serait capable de s'adresser personnellement aux representants locaux du Gouvernement britannique pour solliciter les t. acilites necessaires,et je ne puis m'expliquer comment il lui a semble bondavoir recours a Messieurs Fonckhaus ■ et tie dans ce but. Le sieur Hadji Hassan manque de droit de mettre la maison allemande a Lingah en cause en ce qui rapporte a 1'expedition proje^fee par lui: je dois a * ailleurs vous prier de bien vouloir recommander a Messieurs Fonckhaus et Cie a Lingah de cesser leur in tervention en sa faveur et de le referer a 1'Agent de la Residance dans ce port. bans toutes les lettres envoyees pan les representants de mon Gouvernement dans le Golfe Persique au sujet de 1*affaire en litige vous remarquerez que le permis d’enlever I'oxyde deja mine a Abou Mousa est au nom de Messieurs Fonckhaus et Cie seuls - pour leur permettre de s*acquitter de leur obligations contractees ante^ieuie- ment. Selon votre lettre du I-' mars 1910 ces obligations ont ete deja acquittees,et a mon avis Messieurs Fonckhaus et Cie manquent de toute raison de s'interesser par le y* \ \ subsequent a la maniere de disposer de I'oxyde qui reste.ROBERT WONCKHAUS &amp; Co., LINGAH.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000d9_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/322</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000d9</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/322</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 4949/1912 Pt 5 Persian Gulf: Abu Musa oxide</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1909/1913</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-01-31T12:04:54</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ger</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (296 folios)</extent><extent>The file’s contents are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.The subject 4949 (Abu Musa oxide) consists of six volumes, IOR/L/PS/10/318-323.

The dispute was sparked by the Ruler of Sharjah, Shaikh Ṣaqr bin Khālid Āl Qāsimī’s cancellation of the concession in 1907, and subsequent claims by Wönckhaus and Company and the German Government, over financial losses arising from the cancellation of the concession.The majority of the file’s correspondence is in German. Official letters exchanged between the German Consul at Bushire and the British Political Resident are in French.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the German Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>German Consul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Abū Mūsá</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Robert Wönckhaus and Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Ferric oxide</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, red oxide, Abu Musa</topic></subject><subject><topic>Mining</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000d9#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
