PRINTED IN INDIA' BY TUB HANAGEB GOVERNMENT 07 INDIA PRESS SIMLA 1948British Consulate, Shiraz. The present work, which was written under my general supervision in the sum mer and autumn of 1945, is intended to be read in conjunction with the Report on Fare by Captain A.T. Wilson C.M.G., (Simla, Government Monotype Press, 1916) and a Report on the Tribes of Pars by Captain A. J. Christian (Simla, Government Monotype Press, 1919) both of which it in part supercedes. In one respect, by omitting a survey of the Boir Ahmadi, it differs from these two publications. The reason for this omission is that although part of the Boir Ahmadi summer quarters lies within Ears official Persian contacts with the tribe have, since the transfer of the Farmandari of Behbehan from the province of Ears to thafc of Khuzestan, lain with Ahwaz rather than Shiraz. For the purpose of compiling the present work access was had to consular archives including reports made by some of the British military officers attached to the con sulate in Shiraz as Liaison Staff from 1942 to 1945. Thus the reports of Major F. Fowler, Black Watch, were the exclusive source for the sections on the Fursimadun, Kashkuli and Darrehshuri tribes of Qashqai as well as for Mamassani and Doshman- ziuri and reports made by Captain J. R. Henry, Gordon Highlanders, were drawn on for the sections covering the Buseri tribe of Khamseh, for Kordshuli and for Kashkuli Kuchek of Qashqai. Reference was also made to the reports of Captain O. C. Garrod, R.A.M.C., O.B.E., who was in command of a mobile dispensary that operated in tribal territory in Fars in 1943 and 1944. It is possible that this is the last report on the tribes of Pars that will be compiled from British sources. Firstly because it is perhaps unlikely that British officials and officers will in future be available in sufficient numbers or will again have the opportunity of moving about freely in tribal territory. Secondly because evolution, either natural or imposed, will inevitably in the not distant future divorce the tribes from their migratory life and settle them, with a consequent loss of tribal identity, fermanently on the land.

Conventional spellings of commonplace-names such as Isfahan, of proper names and titles such as Reza Shah, Qavam ul Mulk, and of other terms in common use such as Islam, khan, have been employed and no attempt made to indicate their Persian pronunciation. ^ In Ears local pronunciation of the syllable -an is -un. Where this occurs in the termination of place-names the Persian spelling and not the local pronunciation has been followed. For some words pronounced with a final -un no written version has been found and in these cases the pronunciation has been accepted for purposes of transliteration. All syllables pronounced locally -un are not necessarily written -«n. Kazerun for instance, is written, as well as pronounced, with a final -un. The Turki ending -lu is equivalent to the Persian ending -i (ye nesbati). Turki- speaking tribespeople use these two endings indiscriminately so that Bob and Bollu, Qaraquni and Qaraqtmlu etc., are identical. iii, Persian Vocabulary For ease of reading the Persian vocabulary employed in this report has been cut to a minimum. Those Persian and Turki words that appear in the text have been inserted to avoid the confusion that might arise from the use of an English transla tion. Such words have been underlined and are as follows : Ilkhflni .. •• Leader of an “ II ” (meaning literally “ tribe ” but actually employed for “ group of tribes ”). Sarparast .. .. Supervisor ; man in charge. Kalvntar .. •• Chief or joint chief of a sub-tribe (teyefeh). The post is, in principle, a Government appointment. Kadkhodtf .. ..

It is of Turkoman origin Turki bei™ th* language spoken by the 80,000 tribesmen who may still be reckoned as Oashaai Almost all speak Persian as well. ^ ^ * HISTORY. The recent history of the Qashqai tribe is one of a gradual disintegration and decline in political a_nd military importance. This process is likely to continue and may be accelerated by disunity in the tribe and by settlement on the land. In 1918 the Qashqai. although known to be split by dissension, were considered to be a powerful fighting force by the standards of that time. From 4 to R (ion armed m&lt;n went into action against the combined forces of the South Persia riaTe™ t “r d the Army in 1918. The decline of Qashq^Tan .fefr^fmm Mosaddeq es Saltaneh (Dr. Mosaddeq, Majles deputy for Tehran) wh^n General of Fars in ,920. effected arecoLiaiion bcUen Soulat ed DoulhZX Asha er, father of hjaser Khan) and Ebrahim Khan, Qavam-ul-Muilr TTo ?

The latter remainpT^ i Ilkhvni until the abolition of the post in 1928. official Soulat ed Douleh went to Tehran in 1923 to pay his resnects to 'Rpyo / * that time Qavam ul Mulk had not yet done so) leaving NuL Kba^ the m charge of the tribe. Reza Shah had intended to detain Soulat ed Douleh but was not sufficiently sure of public reaction and eventually made no attemnt tn ! his return to Furs. Ini 928 the Shah engineered SoulIt’^eZnTXZdevX and m this way he enticed him to, and kept him in, Tehran. de puty 1^26 the first Military Governor Rntradipr Vutrar • Qnshqai; Soil™ Abbus Mo’uyer was his much baled assistant. One SGoveraor^ first actions was to scud baser Khan to join his father in the capita], whither W&gt;« three brothers, Malek Mansur, Mohammad Hosseiu and Khosru arconm ' ^T They were also detained in late 1927. Tims tie last traces of the centmftrZi authority disappeared in 1926. mral tribal The Military Governor set about the tasks of enforced j ment in 1926 and 1927. The sub-tribal khans, whose appointments werehemffit^' were removed from their posts and Government nrminees installed in their places' W.tb the ultimate object of destroying Qashqai as an independent power ^60™™ ment introduced a harsh control (which was also venal) over them. The enforcS settlement was far from effective: many sub-tribes were ordered to settle,nareas specifically chosen as climatically and physically unsuitable. Their only escape fmm settlement was by the payment of large bribes to officials and Army officers for th^ privilege of migrating and many sub-tribes adopted this course which eq^Med to tbeirimppverisbmc.it. By these methods the Government achieved the result desired ; many thousands of sheep, goats and cattle were killed off and the nZber of horses was drastically reduced. numoer The disarmament carried out by Reza Shah's troops did not bv any mean, account for all the Qashqa. rifles. Many were hidden or buried and subseZnT ly returned to use. But for,ton years the tribesmen did not dare to caZy arm,and fcliii period, 1931—1941, during which no organised Qashqai fighting forca wa&lt;&lt; in existerice, seem^ to have had a taming influence on them. “ Fighting Strength ' in Qashqai is not now a readily reckoned factor because in many ca-es the inclina tion to fight (although not the inchna ion for robbery and armed holdups) has ds appeared. The period of oppression under Reza Shah was not accepted by the Qashqai without a struggle. In 1928 when disarmament was at its height Soulat ed Pculeh and Neser Khan came under closer police supervision than before in Tehran and so the Qashqai could expect no leadership in resistance frotn that quarter. But in late 1929 Ali Khan SbItu Heshmat (half-brother of Sotilat ed Doilleh) gather d together the remaining armed men of Qashqai to offer resistance to General Shrhbakliti’s forces (Shahbakhti was the G. 0. C. troeps in Fars at that time). Shvhbakhti sent to Tehran for Malek Mansur Khan in tlm hope that he would call on the Qashqai to surrender their arms but shortly* after his arn\ al in Shiraz IVIalek Mansijr escaped andtook over the leadership of the rebellion from Ali Khan. This was the only occasion on which Malek Mansur led the tribe. He was never appointed Ilkhvni. Shnkbakhti appealed to Tehran for help and Ge neral Habiboliah Sheibuni was sent with reinforcements. The Qashqai forces were infermed of the approach of these reinforcements and made a surprise attac k c n the P( 1-e Khun bridge ac ross the Kur river at Mervdasht, 30 miles north of Shiraz, where they killed 25 soldiers in a sharp skirmish. They did not succeed in destroying the bridge before t he arrival of Sheibuni’s troops from the north and were beaten oif with losses. Elms Khan Kashkuli took a prominent part in this battle. General Sheibtni’s troeps. entered Shiraz in the late autumn of 1929. In 1930 Sheibuni copied Shuhbakhti’s tactics : he sent for Soulat cd Douleh from Tehran and succeeded in making most of the rebel Qashqai surrender to Sculat and in disarming Ali Khan 5 s followers. Soon afterwards the Khans who had joined the rebellion including Elies Kashkuli were removed to, and detained in, the north. Malek Mansur remained at large in bars. In 1930 the Boir Ahmadi also revolted against the Government. Sheiberi had Nuser Khan (who had been elected Q ishqai deputy to the 8th Majle ) sent from T&lt; h: an and taking Neser and his father with him he start-d e peratiors against the Beir Ahmadi north and west of Ardekun. He suffered heavy casualties in a battle at Tang-e-Temorudi in Boir Ahmadi country (at which Seulatand Nicer were present) but eventually scattered the Boir Ahmadi forces. In thiscampaignhe. was assisted by armed men from Mamassani and Doshmanzmi. Reza Shah’s Minister of War at that time, Ja’afar Qoli Khan, Sardur As’ad (cousin of Morteza Q li Samsam Bakh- tiuri) proceeded by way of Bakhtiuri territory to the Kuhgalu area w here he received the surrender of the rebel Emum Qali Khan Rostam (father of Hossein Qoli Rest am Mamassani) as well as Shokrollah Khan Boir Ahmadi (father of Aldclhh Khan Zarghumpur). He sent these chiefs to Tehran for detention where they were kter joined by Sartip Khan Boir Ahmadi (father of Mohammad Hossein Tutu ri). Sardar As’ad was later accused of conspiring with some of these tribal leade rs against the Shah and he, together with Emem Qoli Rostam and Shokrollah and Sartip Boir Ahmadi, was shot. In 1931 Soulat ed Douleh was again under supf rvision in Tehran. Malek Mansur was still an outlaw in the mountains north of Beizu and Mohanmiad Hossein and Khosru were at school in Tehran. In 1931 Colonel Seyyed Shnker Khan was appointed to th&lt;' Qashqai Governorate. He received Malek Mansur’s surrender in Beizx; and sent him to Tehran. MalekTehran All the euh-trihes were nnited in their opposition to Government control but by no means all wished Neeer Khan to head the federation. During 1942 and 1943 the Qashqai looted and robbed at will T .^ outburst of lawlessness was the reaction to the Government oppressions of Reza Shahs time for the Qashqai is not a habitual thief. Neser Khan was variously referred to as a rebel, a brigand and an outlaw. The army was too weak to break him and ^0 ? his position was a threat to the Central Government he was left alone. At this time his two brothers Malek Mansur Khan and Mohammad Hossein Khan we rem Germany. This fact, combined with the knowledge that a group of German pa chutists were being harboured by him and that he had prepared a landing-ground at Farreshband, made Noser’s position one of opposition to tne allies. In late 1942 the Government decided to attempt to break Nuser Khan s power- In February of that year General Shuhbakhti was appointed to the command ot the troops in Fars with instructions to begin operations for the subduing and disarmament of Qashqai and other dissident tribes. His campaign was delayed for 3* months through lac 1 : of support from Tehran and when he eventually went into action his * objective was the capture of Firuz^bnd and Farreshband, Qashqai centres m e south. His columns converged on these two points from Jahrom in the east, Kav«r in the north and K^zerun in the west. The western column advanced through Jerreh unopposed and took Farmshband. The northern column was nearly routed at Kav?r by Qashqai forces and got no further than that village. The eastern column was reinforced and finally took Firuzub^d on June 11,1943. Sh«hbakhti did not follow up this minor success and the tribes were allowed to move north. On July o alorce of Persian troops was overwhelmed by a mixed band of Qashqai and Boir Ahma i at Semirom, “ the tribal capital of the north ”. The tribes captured over one thou sand rifles and many other arms. The demoralising effect on the rest of Shuhbakhti s army was sufficient to put an end to all operations against Qashqai. The Qashqai came to a vague agreement with the Government in 1943 for the maintenance of security and no further attempt has been made by the army to break Nuser Khan s power since that date. Towards the end of 1943 when he was firmly in position as head of the tnbe r Nsser instituted his policy of security throughout the Qashqai. This met with some success and the migrations were carried out with few incidents in the spring of 1944* At that time—-when it had become obvious that the allies were winning the war—the political situation with regard to the Qashqai began to clear. On May 23, 1944 the Germans were handed over by the Qashqai. There were various reasons for this . Nuser bartered for the return of his two brothers, he realised that he could not afford to be on the wrong side of the fence in the event of an allied victory and he possibly hoped that the British would gratefully help him to negotiate with the Persian Government. On May 1, 1944 Nsser Khan visited Shiraz, calling on the local Persian authority and also on His Majesty’s Consul to whom he declared his desire for a reconciliation with His Majesty’s Government. When the Shah paid his first visit to Shiraz in the same month N^ser, fearing arrest, failed to come in and present himself. But his two brothers, Malek Mansur and Khosru became reconciled with Qavam ul Mulk in Tehran and as a result Qavam organised a meeting between himself, Morteza Qoli Samsam Bakhtiuri and Kaser at Kuh Ruyeh in early August 1944. N«ser wanted Abdollah Zarghwnpur, Boir Ahmadi to be present but the other participants would not agree. Abdollah Zar- ghvmpur subsequently subscribed to the decisions reached which were co-operation« ' Ui) the area between the Shirai-Lor road in the eaet and the Shirae-Buehire road in the west etretching south to within BO miles of the Gulf coast, 2.

(a) Summer Quarters : In .the east and north-east the country consists of a succession of parallel ridges and valleys running north-west to south-east. The Kur is the only large river. It rises west of ysopus and flows eastwards through the Kamfrruz valley and the Rvm- jerd plain to the Mervdasht plain. In the north the Garmubsd stream rises neax Emum Qais and flows west to join the Kurun. The broad high valleys have a plenti ful water supply from springs and streams and there is good grazing on the hill- slopes from spring until late summer.narJwet “ ’“ 0rC , r “^ ed - the riJ K C8 tig^er ^&lt;1 the valley. fa mXof The'^V M v™ W YT? m0re P 1 ™^' 1 althou g h little U8 « ,,c \ Th , R cr 5 ?’ !rbor nses m ,h&lt;!

In summer the Qashqai migrate to the northern area [see 2-(V)l where the aver age elevation of the valleys is about 6,000 ft. The heavy winter snowfall which Iks on some of the mountain-tops throughout the year feeds the many springs and streams throughout the summer and cultivation, particularly in the north and east is con- G ] razm g ^ mams on the cool hill-slopes until autumn when the advent of cooler weather gives the signal for the migration to the south. Tn wmter the chmate of the northern area is very severe. Throughout the Semirom, Khosru Shinn and ysopns areas snow falls heavily. J n the west there is up to six feet of snow m the Ardek-en district and more in the high valleys to the fl°\ Kuken, etc.). Such conditions make the transfer of the Qashaai flocks to the south essential. In the low-lying Beiz* and Rnmjerd plains cultivation continues throughout the winter in a milder climate. 1 1 The southern valleys in winter provide grazing for the flocks and W-a weather conditions. The rainfall is less her! than^Ysewh reTn th e 2^.m and .now ,s rare. The settled villagers have stored their firei cmps by julytdaov again in November. The area produces wheat, barley, rice, opium, Cotton, dates and tobacco. In spring the arrival of the hot weather soon paiches the ground and usually about Nau Ruz (March 23) the movement to the north begins. In the northern area, crops of wheat, barley, peas, beans and opium are grown. In the lower, hotter and swampy area of Pedenv, Kamfiruz, the Beizu and the Rnm- ierd valleys there is much rice cultivation, COMMUNICATIONS, 1. EXTERNAL. (a) Summer Quarters: The main Shiraz-Isfahan road has a number of motorable (summer) roads mnningfromittothe west which give access to several of the main centres in the summer quarters. In addition much of the north and north-eastern territory is not difficult country and many tracks can be covered by a jeep. (i) Shiraz to Ardekun : summer only ; surface good ; formerly continued via Komehr and Kckcn to Tol-e Khosru with branch to Dez-e Kord ; the Tol-e Khosru road could be easily repaired. (w) Dehbid to Khonjesht (UC4588): thence westwards across country to yb Burik (UC2292) and southwards via the Bezan pass to Ahmadcbtid (C3861). From Ahmadubed, a jeep will, with difficulty, reach ysopus or alternatively Shirbunu (UC4852) in the north, Summer only. (iii) Surmaq to Eqlid ; the latter a Qashqai trading centre ; summer only ; sur face fair. ‘ (tv) ybsdeh to Kushk-e Zard : via Najafebud (approx. PX0844) surface good summer only. (v) ybudeh to Khosru Shirin (PW71) : summer only, surface good. (vt) Shshrezt? to Semirom (W4561) surface satisfactory; closed December to March : a short track leads off westwards to Mehr-e Gerd (W1875). A jeep will with difficulty cover the track that links this track to Garmebed (R1300) and Urujsn in Bakhtim Cheh^r Mahul (see Darrehshuri Route Report Page 37.) (vtt) Semirom to Khosru Shirin (and Kushk-e Zard) with branch to Hanntf (PW43): surface satisfactory ; summer only; the ybudeh-Khosru Shirin and Semirom-Khosru Shirin tracks meet at approx point (P7116); the Kushk-e Zard track leaves the Khosru Shirin-ybcdeh track at approx point (PX0239). (b) Winter Quarters. Three main roads motorable in both summer and winter serve the Qashqai winter quarters; they are the Shiraz-Fasu-Jahrom-L'erroad,the Shiraz-Firuzsbsd road and the Shiraz-Bushire road with the branch into Fehliun (Mamassani). In addition there is the track from Borezjvn across the Duleki river (impassable in spring) to Gan«veh (P3455)and the A.I.O.C. road thence to Gach Suren which gives access to the northern section of the winter quarters via the Mishun (A70) track. Motorable tracks leading off these roads are few and mostly in poor condition but the following were covered in the years 1943—1945. (t) The route Shiraz-Kaver (H5025)-Khafr (J0301)—Qotbubud (04374). Sur face poor but motorable throughout the year. (it) A motorable track from Lur north-westward to Khonj (T3286). In 1944 grain lorries covered the track 50 miles further westward* to Chub Kuzeme (00308).9 (m) Track Ktjzcrun south-westwards to Sirszjun (G813T) (see F«rsfmad«n route report Page 62) condition very poor.

ORGANIZATION. 1. Introduction : Political and Nvser Khan’s position, Nuser Khan Qashqai has, since his return to Fars in 1941, secured for himself Tf tl0n ,°' iead °/ t^lbe • He bolds no appointment from the Government nsllkhnni (the post having been abolished in 1928) and his only official commission is his responsibility as Ra’is-e Entezamat for security in the Qashqai area. He enjoys much of the authority and privileges and claims the loyalty and pres tige of the Ilkhmi. Although he exacts no official dues from the sub-tribes he receives regular gifts of cattle, horses, agricultural produce and possibly land from the leading subordinate khans over whom he can and does exert much authority. He directs the migration, orders changes in the position of tribal areas, appoints khans in the sub-tribes over which he has close control, particularly the Sheshboluki and can in most cases ensure the removal of undesirable leaders in the other sub-tribes It is probable that no command of Nuser’s is ignored but that Nuser tempers his commands so as not to strain such allegiance as exists. How far Neser could carry the other khans with him in matters of external policy—e.#., combined resistance to disarmament, alliance with tribes such as Boir Ahmadi to resist the Govern ment and similar major questions—is open to question : the indications are that if he tried he would fail. same circumstances that have produced the semblance of unity in the Qashqai under Nuser Khan might well serve to bolster up Nuser on occasions when his personal authority would otherwise be inadequate. The attitude towards the Government of all the tribes of Fars, not only the Qashqai, is one of distrust. In he days of Reza Shah’s harsh rule a hatred of the Government was born that would qinckly flare up again if the Government made any attempt to regain control over the tribes. This distrust and lingering hatred help to consolidate the position of Nuser Khan so that he is not only the son of the loathed but respected Soulat ed Houleh and himself possessor of a strong personality but also “ leader of the resist ance .The attitude of the most important sub-tribes io Noser Khan is reviewed under each separate sub-tribe. 2. Organization. The organization of the sub-tribes—now only 15 in number- under Nosef Khan is as follows : Only the four largest sub-tribes (Darrehshuri, Kashkuli, Sheshboluki and For- simadon) are of political importance : these four represent about 75 per cent, of the total Qashqai population and their Khans have much influence in the handling of the internal and external affairs of the tribe. The Amalch section, numbering about 1,500 families, is the personal following and bodyguard of Neser Khan and his family—the feudal lord’s retainers——and over them Nuser Khan has complete personal control. The smaller sub-tribes—Safi Khani, Yalemeh, Gallehzan etc.—-come under Nuser Khan’s direct control to a greater extent than the more independent larger sections. Each sub-tribe has its ruling family of khans from which the lalantar or lalan- tars is appointed. This appointment is usually by the general consent of the whole sub-tribe and in the case of sub-tribes where Neser Khan has considerable control the appointment is made with his consent. Although a test case has not yet arisen it is unlikely that the appointment of khans of the major sub-tribes would be subject to Nuser Khan’s approval. Each sub-tribe is divided into its sub-section under the control of kadkhodas. The JcadJchodas are elected by the members of the sub sections and with the consent of the kalantars. (see analysis of relevant sub-tribes under heading ORGANIZA TION). Kadkhodas are responsible to their Kalantar for the behaviour of their sub-sec tions and, in theory, the kalantar is responsible to Neser Khan for the security of his area. Complaints against the Qashqai are commonly addressed to Neser Khan as Ka'is-e Entezamat. He then seeks out the guilty and instructs tl e relative sub ordinate khan to deal with them. 3. Financial. The tribespeople rely on their khans for imported goods from the town markets and all sales are carried cut through these leaders. Thus the kalantar is entirely responsible for the welfare of his following whose conditions of life improve or deterio rate according to the degree of the kalantar's rapacity. As a rule the kalantar handles all trade through agents in Shiraz and other market centres. Although the chief makes his own substantial gain much of the profits go in the dues on goods sold in market areas and in paying the middleman’s share. This absence of direct dealing between individual tribesmen and the consumers of tribal produce partly accounts for the standard of living being lower in tribal than in settled areas. ECONOMIC. 1. Revenue. The principal source of income of the Qashqai is their flocks. These provide— both for sale and forborne consumption—meat, fats, skins, mi : k and wool. From the latter are made tribal carpets, rugs, blankets, saddle-bags and many other woven goods. In addition there is extensive cultivation, in the winter quarters,of cereals, dates, opium, cotton and tobacco and in the summer quarters of barfev, wheat, beans, fruit etc. The leading khans, whose income represents the major part of the wealth of the whole tribe usually possess lands in both summer and winter quarters. These lands are worked jointly by local peasantry and tribespeople. The latter, who are selected from the different sub-sections in turn, are excluded by the kalantar from the yearly migration and stay behind to help in the cultivation of his land. The properties qf the Khans are often large and in very fertile regions, in clude many villages and settlements and are the source of much wealth. Nuser Khan and his family in particular possess many productive estates which give them a large and steady basic income. 2. Economic Conditions. As was outlined under ORGANIZATION the tribespeople are very dependent on the Jcalantars. The Jcalantars are men of means and the people are far from pros perous. Many of those who broke away from the tribe in Reza Shah’s time became farmers and saw far better times. Many others who had the good fortune to be settled in the winter quarters before 1941 also acquired prosperity which they lost when, driven presumably by the old independent spirit, they resumed the migra tion. This partial abandonment of agriculture combined with the necessity of carrying on trade through rapacious agents and intermediaries and the difficulty of obtaining goods that are a Government monopoly and the consequent resort to the free market is the prime cause for the generally low standard of living in Qashqai. Compared, however, with the Khamseh and many of the settled districts (e.*/., Estahbunut) of Ears, the Qashqai are fairly well-off. This results partly from the proceeds of two years of plundering and robbery, (of which the greater share went to the khans) and partly from the fact that 14,000 migratory Qashqai families are liv ing in an area that formerly contained nearly 30,000 nomadic families. Further, Naser Khan and the principal subordinate khans have for several years followed a policy of subsidising the agriculture and stock breeding of the poorer sections of the tribe. In many parts of Qashqai the khans have ensured a regular supply of mono poly goods to their people butinmany others such supplies have been appropriated for private profit. The name of Khosru Khan, Naser’s youngest brother, has been particularly associated with these malpractices. With a fairer distribution of wealth the tribe would have enjoyed prosperity during the closing years of the war. There is little doubt that during this time the majority of the Qashqai Khans have laid aside considerable fortunes against an uncertain future. 3. Taxation. Neither Nuser Khan, as head of the tribe, nor any of the subordinate khans whose appointments have never been ratified by the Government has the right to levy dues on the Qashqai people. Neser Khan has encouraged sub-tribes to live on their incomes and has himself kept Government tax-collectors at bay. The khans naturally make their profits on all trading in tribal produce and receive regular gifts in kind from their following. The Government therefore receives no taxes from the tribe fcpart from those levied on goods going to market. The khans even more than the ordinary Persian landlord manage to evade paying taxes on their properties. RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURING TRIBES. In their summer quarters the Qashqai have as their neighbours the Boir Ahmadi in the west, the Bakhtriri in the north, the Arabs and Buseri of Khamseh to the east and in the south the Mamassani. In the winter quarters they are bordered by theBsseri, Mamassani, DosLmanziBri and the Kuhgalu tribes of B^sht and B^vi. The attitude of the different sub-tribes of Qashqai to these neighbouring tribes varies and particular reference is made to this subject in the analysis of each sub-tribe under the heading “Relations with Neighbours'”. In general relations are as follows: The Boir Ahmadi and Qashqai are bound by a pact to unite in resisting Govern ment attack. In the time of Reza Shah Nuser Khan and Abdollah Khan Zarghrm- pur the Boir Ahmadi chief, were both under detention in Tehran and they made their escape from the capital at about the same time. The two chiefs seem personally loyal enough to the terms of their pact but the extent to which the tribes would follow them, if called upon to do so, is doubtful. Robberies and counter robberies, with the Boir Ahmadi as first offenders, are continually occurring between the two tribes but seem to be settled amicably. The Qashqai and Khamseh are old enemies. The Qashqai point to the Arabs and Buseri as example of the evil results of submission to the Government. For their part the Arabs and Baseri long for the day when the Qashqai will be forced to submit to the Government. On the surface at least, however, the two tribes main tain friendly relations. The frequent robberies that take place between the two peoples are generally settled by correspondence between Nuser Khan and the Khamseh Governor Lotfali Qavami. The Qashqai regard the Khamseh as a ragged and disorganized rabble and the Khamseh describe the Qashqai as of inferior fight ing qualities and hint hopefully that they are due for deflation in the near future. Qashqai relations with the Mamassani also are a little strained. The Qashqai continue to covet the Mamassani lands, a very fertile area, and threaten occupation if a lease is not granted. How far this threat is idle is not known. Certainly the Mamassani have no intention of yielding and they profess to regard the Qashqai as easy opponents should they come to battle. The Qashqai do not advertise their intentions and show no signs of attempting a forcible occupation of any Mamassani territory but they claim that, after years of settlement, the Mamassani are no fighters. Relations with Bakhtiuri appear to be good. There are constant thefts on the borders of the Qashqai summer quarters but relations between Nnser Khan and Morteza Qoli Khan Bakhtiuri are cordial. RELATIONS WITH PERSIAN GOVERNMENT. Since the abdication of Reza Shah Persian officialdom has recovered little of its lost authority in the Qashqai area. There are Government officials in Ardekan, Eqlid and Semirom in the summer quarters and Firuzubud, where Khosru Khan holds the appointment, although he is rarely in the place, of Governor, in the winter quarters. These offices include the civil finance administration, health, education, supply (kharbar) services and the municipality, but they exercise no control over remote tribal districts. The Qashqai interest in civil administration extends only to the distribution of Government monopoly goods. On the military side, there are gendarmerie centres at the above mentioned places and pos^s on the routes to those places. The Army maintains insignificant garrisons at Ardekun, Semirom, Beizn and Firuznb^d as well as on the main road skirting the tribal area. Beyond this there is no Government interference in Qash qai territory where, in Reza Shah’s time, an unarmed man could supposedly travel on foot by night without protection. Semirom is regarded by the tribe as their capital and the khans declare that they will not tolerate the presence of any large body of Government troops there. The 1943 incident in Semirom is proof of their determination.13 Th« varies -tribe ,re as •vern- rtfm* they seem tribes unter tween 'iraba For ;ed to main- i two I the igged fight- e. shqai •ation y the shqai their issani re no n the and of its eken, Khan the ralth, se no ation ioned leant road ^ash- ravel their large their IT * 18 not responsible for security in the Qashqai area r does it have any say m the appointment of kalantars etc. Instead, to save face, to lighten their own burden and to make a feeble gesture for law and order, the Government charges certain leading khans with the security of their tribal areas and, frequently, of additional territory as well. In the case of Qashqai neither arms noi ammunition is provided for this purpose but a fatuous system exists whereby “cart- ernment 1 ’^^ 64 m ^ P reservatlon of law an &lt;l order will be replaced by the Goy- 0a AH Government officials are viewed with suspicion and aversion, an attitude the ?

As there are considerable differences in the appearance and the physical charac teristics of the different sub-tribes of Qashqai this aspect is dealt with under the appropiate sub-tribal heading. unaer tne 1. Khans. uereoMl ^ “ rUle ’ clo8etotbeir P«&gt;Pl* and are atteuded by a personal tollowmg. They live in more luxurious surroundings than and eniov nmnv of the comforts of life denied to, the ordinary tribesman. Most adopt a style of drew that !s a mixture of traditional tribal and European but their dress may become purely tribal or purely European according to whether the wearer is taking part in tribal ceremomes or has business in Shiraz. g P C Q Most of the khans refrain from extortionate treatment of their neonle but th«v are far from bemg benevolent. If they wished they could improve £ conditions considerably by taking less for themselves. Nevertheless, provided that h s rule is just, the halantar receives the allegiance and respect of h s sub tribe and his judgement is accepted without question. d „;f,,T b8 ^ asht L ai k t han is of u P ri « ht and manI 7 faring and in his dealing with his people and with other tribes seems to put much store by honestv truth end Justice—at least in matters that do not affect his own purse. With stranuem h« £ reserved and suspicious, usually twists or avoids the truth in his conve3on and even when friendly relations are estabUshed invariably gives the imnresJibf' n, d evasive and slippery. In his dealings with the Gove^ent and h^ Sr eneZ moral considerations have no part. enemies14 It is the custom of the ruling families, from whom the khans are chosen, to intermarry and N'eser Khan is strongly in favour of maintaining this tradition, even among his own family. The women of the khan’s family enjoy a position nearing equality with the men and monogamy is a strict rule. The veil is not worn. The Qashqai women seem to be endowed with intelligence, dignity and sensibility above the average Persian woman. Sons of the khans are pampered but at about 8 years they, in company with the other tribal boys, learn to ride and shoot and quickly become accustomed to the vigorous nomad life. The khan, who is generally literate nowadays, sees that, where* e ter possible, his son picks up reading and writing in the nearest village school or from one of the educated members of the sub-tribe. Tribal boys are frequently sent to school in Shiraz or Tehran. 2. The Tribesmen. Although the general standard of living is lower than that of the villager, the y Qashqai nomad is, in every way, a better man than his settled compatriot. Hia hard and vigorous life makes him healthy and free from the many oiseascs pre valent in the villages and gives him a strong, tough physique that is rare outside the tribes. Many of the customs and characteristics peculiar to certain sub-tribes a r e mentioned elsewhere. In general tribesmen re cleanly and healthy in their mode ol living, straightforward and honest in their dealings with one another and work well together. They allow none of their own people to go without assistance when it is necessary and they avoid quarrels. Blood feuds and the like are almost non-exist ent in Qashqai. Towards strangers and other tribes they show little respect although the tradition of hospitality ensures a warm reception for any visitor who has^ an introduction, either personal or by letter. They rob and plunder from other tribe* and tra vellers but when accused by their chief confess freely and take their punish* ment. The visitor need have no fear of any of his belongings being missing when he leaves a Qashqai camp : thefts of that nature are unknown. In most parts of Qashqai the men choose their wives freely and brokerage in marriage is foreign to them. Monogamy is the rule and if a man divorces his wife it is generally because her family has been in some way disgraced. Tribal women \„re most industrious and by their activities—working in the fields, spinning and weaving etc.—are one of the maiustays of tribal economy : this may account for the respect in which they are held by their menfolk. The stable and happy family life of Qashqai has been commented on by almost all who have known them. STRENGTH. The following table gives the total strength of all the tribes of Qasbqai as 36, &lt;90 families or nearly 184,000 souls (5 members to each family). These figures not only include sub-tribes and sections of sub-tribes that have been settled for many years but also the Persian peasantry on the lands and estates owned by the ruling Qashqai family and by the khans of all the sub-tribes. If a sub-tribe, although largely settled, sends a group of its people on migration to pasture its sheep in a cooler or warmer area, as the case may be, the sub-tribes is considered by the Qashqai to be “ migratory ” and “ pure Qashqai ”. In reality many such tribespeople who send ^ . their flocks on migration with a group of shepherds to tend them have been settled so long with their Persian neighbours that they can no longer be reckoned as Qashqai nomads. Other tribes, completely settled, have been entered under “ Amal^has Qaskqai. These people arc Nt?ser Khan’s (or his family^) retainers : in many Cases they are not even racially Qashqai and in others they are classed by Naser Khan (and by themselves) with the common Persian peasant. All the 184,000 souls mentioned above are under Nuser Khan’s control. He can tax them and treat them as he wills and therefore he calls them Qashqai. But more than half of the grand total can no longer be reckoned as true Qashqai nomads. Qualifications for the description “ true Qashqai nomad ” seem fairly defined as follows : Turki ancestry or long-standing connexions with the Persian Turki tribes : annual migration or delegation of certain members of each family to join tbs migration when and where 'directed by Nuser Khan : acknowledgement of Qashqai “ nationality ” (membership of Nuser Khan’s tribe). Fulfilment of these requirements would, it is considered, eliminate approxi mately 100,000 of the total of 184,000 quoted above thus leaving the true figure of Qashqai at just over 80,000 souls, which is probably approximately correct. The enquirer in Qashqai meets with various definitions of the word “total”. For instance there is (f) Nuser Khan’s “ minimum total ” which is 184,000 as quoted above, (ii) the “ monopoly goods total ”, 400,000 souls, quoted when claiming sugar, tea, etc. from the responsible Government Department and (Hi) the “ Conscription total ”, 80,000 souls (and this is possibly the true total) quoted to the army for purposes of conscription. (Nuser Khan allows no Qashqai to servo in the Army). Although it is possible by elimination to reduce the total of Qashqai to about 80,000 souls, there is no way of similarly reducing the figures for individual sub tribes and sub-sections to their proper proportions to give the total of 80,000 unless each figure is multiplied by the factor 4/9 and to do this would be prejudicial to some groups and flattering to others. The figures of sub-tribes and sub-sections supplied by Nuser Khan and his subordinates are therefore given without amend ment (see ANALYSIS OF SUB-TRIBES and DETAILED ANALYSIS OF MAIN SUB-TRIBES). The armed strength of Qashqai is almost impossible to calculate. The follow ing figures are very approximate : (i) 4,000 good modern rifles Brno, Lee Enfield, late German, Russian and French types together with a few American rifles (ii) 6—10,000 older and less effective weapons (older Lee Enfields, Mausers and other Continental models); less than 100 heavy and light machine guns, sub-machine guns and carbines. Spread out among the sub-tribes of Qashqai there are probably more than 10,000 armed fighting men. The former method of reckoning—one fighting man to every family— can be used only with a very few sub-tribes. The loyalty of most of the ten thousand goes no further than their Kalantar and it is doubtful if Nuser Khan 1 as more than 2,0i;0 “ soldiers ” whom he can count upon. These latter would be drawn mostly from the Amaleh tribes. The remainder of the total of 10,000 form* the security^ escort and fighting forces under the control of the individual kalantort.17 APPENDIX 1—PERSONALITIES. {For general background see QASHQAI—HI STORY). Mohammad Nuser Khan Qashqai.—Born about 1904. The eldest son of Sonlat ed Douleh, Surdar Ashu’er. Only one of the four brothers who is married Does not smoke or drink and is a model family man. Tall, broadly built, starinc eves slight small-pox marks on face, commanding presence. Accepted but not entirely undisputed leader of the Qashqai which he rules firmly but honestly and well. Fast talker and a good raconteur. Fond of town society and when living in civilised sur roundings is very reasonable and amenable. When living with the tribes he seems to lose his balance (where matters outside the parochial affairs of the tribe are con cerned) and to be easily misled. This instability possibly results from his varied early experiences including imprisonment in Tehran with his father who died in captivity. Until the summer of 1945, when he eventually screwed up courage to co to Tehran, he seems to have been genuinely in fear of re-imprisonment His anxietv to consolidate his position leads him, at the prompting of others, to see in himself a future Governor-General of Fars, Prime Minister and even Shah of Persia He has no confidence in the durability of his pact with Qavam ui Mulk but states that he will not himself make the first move to break it: he is sure that Qa\ am will do that for him. Speaks a little English and understands much. His anti-British past probably arose more from force of circumstances and various antipathies than from his own deliberate choice. Claims to have become pro-British by conviction Ex presses hatred and distrust of the Persian Government and says the Armv only moves to widen its range of extortion. Does not disclose what attitude he would adopt towards an attempt to force disarmament on the Qashqai but if the attempt were made while he was with tribes he would, as he is excitable and easily takefc fright, undoubtedly resist. If while he was in town he was asked to accept some form of voluntary disarmament he might be persuaded to agree : much would depend on the political situation at the time, the terms offered and the support given him by his brothers and leading kalantars. Malek Mansur Qashqai.—Born about 1907, second son of Soulat ed Douleh Sardur Ashu’er. Tall and lithe, hawk-like appearance, very attractive personality* talks much but slowly and tends to repeat himself. Derives useful position of privilege and influence among Boir Ahmadi from having spent his boyhood among them. Education American College Tehran, Brasenose College, Oxford Reading University (agriculture). Joined his brother Mohammad Hossein in Berlin fust be fore the outbreak of the war. Speaks good English, German, a little French, Turkish Turki and Persian. Reported to be loved by the tribespeople where Nuser is feared.’ Devoted to tribal pursuits of shooting and riding. Says his only ambition is to be a farmer and that he must either live with the tribe or go to Europe as he can not tolerate the life of a townsman in Persia, Declares that he will do his utmost to oppose any Government attempt at interference with the tribe and that he is pre pared to fight the Army. Called a “ dervish ” by Shiraz townspeople. ^ Mohammad Hossein Qashqai.—Born about 1912, third son of Soulat ed Douleh Education : American College, Tehran ; Reading University (agriculture). Left England because of chronic asthma and went to Berlin for treatment. Studied economics at Berlin University. Speaks good English, German, some French Turkish, Turki and Persian. Elected deputy for ybedeh 1944. Lives in Tehran! Medium height, becoming gross looking, staring eyes, some facial resemblance to* Nvser Khan. Voluble speaker, very excitable. In his taste and personal conduot1? resembles Khosru ratler than his elder brothers. Avoids n eeti g a glance and i, regarded in Shiraz as unreliable. Khosru Qashqni .—Born about 1921. Youngest son of Soulat ed I-oulcli, Tall, heavily built^ already tending to grossness. Educated Americ an f ollcge, Tehran. The reprobate of the family'. Great personal bravery and recklessness. Was prominent in the 1943 Semirom battle. Inherits his father s cruelty and sadism Credited with a number of wanton killings. Appointed Governor of hm^bed 1943 but never at his post. Made large sums from selling Kashkuh tea siigar and cigarettes. On bad terms with Kashkuli Khans and with General Finn when latter was Governor-General. Qavam on the other hand regards him as the best of the brothers. Much personal charm but a lout. Unsteady eye Consi derable powers of persuasion and great capacity for making mischief. Rash but possibly less easily thrown off his balance than Nuser or Mohammad Hossein. Habitually breaks'his word. Ill-wishers of the Qashqai hope to see a break, between Neser and Khosru and profess to see in Khosru a future tool of the Russians. Is generally described as a “ child ” which is intended by some in excuse of his excesses and by others to mean that it is time he grew up. AUollah Qashqai.— Horn about 1929. Eldest son of Nuser Qashqai. Still a pampered youth at the ageof sixteen. Tall for his age with much personal dignity. Commands respect in the tribes and at the time of migration ,s given, by his father, a share of responsibility for ensuring security. Excellent shot Took part in the battle of Semirom 1943. heft Fars for Tehran October 1945 with object of proceeding to England for edut ation. AU Khan. Solvr [leshmal—Horn 1889. Half brother of Esmtiil Khan Soulat ed Doulch, and full brother of the late Ahmad Khan, Sardur Ehteshnm. Hbeigi 1918. Fought with British troops against Soulat ed Douleh in 1918. The latter seized his lands inFarsand these have never been restored to him. 1929-30 took an active part in the Qashqai revolt. Surrendered and came to Tehran in 1933 June 1943 went to Shiraz to assist Government troops in operations against Qashqai in return for which he hoped to recover his lands. On failure of operations he settled in Shiraz. Receives a nominal pension irregularly paid from the Government but lives in poverty. Reputed to be the bravest member of the Qashqai family. In his declining years is very weak mentally and in conversation harps cease lessly on the help he has* given the British Government for which he complains he has had no return. Seems resigned to finishing his days in obscurity. Most unlikely that he would dare stir up trouble for Nuser Khan in the tribe. Chenqiz Khan. —Born 1921. Eldest eon of Ali Khan. SelurHeshmat. Pleasant and attractive in appearance. Took to the hills with a few followers and rifles in the summer of 1944 and was outlawed. Persuaded to return and make his peace. Lives indolently on family pride. APPENDIX II—GENEALOGY OF THE QASHQAI ILKHANI FAMILY. The tree that follows is that of Der-eb Khan and his descendants.

Legend : K-kban h —born in •married. d—died s—sister dr ~ daughter, dwi' died 'without issue. UonThe letter above a person’* name refers to the mother.PARREHSHUKI ORIGIN The Darrehslmri are traditionally descended from the Qezel Bssh who acted as a security force in the time of Shuh Abbus Safavi. Heidar Ming Bushi, a sub ordinate of Robert Shirley, was their leader. Sh«h Abbns presented the area of Vardasht (present summer quarters of the tribe) to the Qezel Be sh as a reward for courage in battle. Later during the Afghan invasion the Qezel Bdsh were forced to abandon their villages at Vardasht and re treat into the mountains. The ruins of their burned villages can, it is stated, still be seen. .The tribe appears to have joined the Qashqai at the time of Kerim Khan Zand. It does not appear to share the Qashqai origin but to have joined the main group in recent times. * HISTORY During the operations in south-west Persia in 1918, the Darrehshuri under fP Ayw Khan Kikhu were actively hostile to the British. When Sardur Ehtesham ^Zaighnm ed Douleh, elder half-brother of Soulat ed Douleh, father of Nnser Khan .Qashqai) became lllihvni, Ayv.z Khan supported him at first, then later transferred hie allegiance to Soulat ed Douleh (Sarctar Ashs’er) again. In 1920 Ali Paneh Kikhu, an opponent of Soulat ed Douleh, with Nasrollah Khan, took a large section bf the tribe off to Bakhtinri. On the death of Ay^z Khan in 1927 his son Hossein fChan became chief of the tribe. He assisted the Government troops in operations Against the Boir Ahmadi and later the Rostam section of Mamassani. In 1930 -the tribe 'joined the. Qashqai revolt against the Government. Hossein Khan was removed to Tehran in 1932 and was killed there in 1934. Thereafter until 1941 the Darrehshuri were passive under the extortions and harsh treatment of Government officials. In 1937 the tribe was forced to turn loose a great number of animals when they were held up by the Army when returning to their winter quarters. As a result thousands of animals r (the reputed figure—5,000 hors^ and 12,000 sheep—is an exaggeration) were lost. The Darrehshuri quickly profited by the confused situation that followed the abdication of Reza Shah and have since rapidly regained their strength. In 1942, on their way to the winter quarters, part of the Darrehshuri was inter cepted by the Army near Kamfiruz : a scuffle followed in which four soldiers, 9 women and children, two horsemen and several hundred sheep were killed. Neser Khan, on his return to Qashqai, met much opposition, veiled rather than open, from the Darrehshuri but after the first months the Khans concealed their resentment of his presence and they have sincei appeared to support him effectively. The tribe was tery prominent at the Semirom'battle with the Army in 1943—Zaki Khan gives the! figure of his men involved as 800—and it was the Darrehshuri who held up the convoy at Mehr-e Gerd prior to the engagement. Since then, co operating in Nvser RbonVpolicy of security throughout the Qashqai area, the tribe baa boon well-behaved and has indulged only in petty thieving. Jhe tribe is second only to the Sheshboluki in numbers; in strength and Influence it is the most powerful sub-tribe of Qashqai. The. Darrehshuri have the same suspicion of and aversion to all Government r officials a®, the other ^trjbes of Qashqai. It has been hinted that, given Britishsupport, the tribe would withdraw its support from Nusor Khan and could carry the Kashkuli and F^rsimadun with them. Both the latter tribes have marriage links with the Darrehshuri. Ziud and Zaki Khans Darrehshuri have a land dispute with Nuser Khan and this fact combined with their desire to retain their indepen dence might lead the tribe to side against Nuser when they thought the occasion suitable. It is certain the Zisd, Zaki and Mohammed Hassan Khans are opposed to Nuser Khan but follow him as an expedient until Nuser Khan's future becomes clear. As regards disarmament the khans declare that they will not submit to the Government unless guaranteed assistance and security by the British Government. TERRITORY 1.

Physical r( (a) Winter Quarters &gt; , Very mbuhtainoxis in the east (4—5,000 feet); deep ravines along river ‘Zohreli. Good graziilg and few springs. Westwards from the Zohreh river, the deeply furrowed mountains gradually give place to low clay and gypsum hills with occasional prominent features as far as the Leshtar plain. Water here is brackish but springs are found. .. (b) Summer Quarters (Where map references are'not given the names do not appear on current maps) . The Darrehshuri tribe spend the summer in and around the Vardasht plain This area is approximately 20 miles long (from east to west) and ten miles wide (north to south). To the east it is bounded by Kuh-e Alijuq (W37) and Qara Tappeh, to the north by Kuh-e Dashtak, west by Kuh-e Ojdehu and Kuh-e yqdasht and to the south by Kuh-e Saqqez. The eastern section is rolling plain but the western section is broken by several isolated features, for example Kuh-e Alavi Kuh-e Sar Cheghu. Kuh-e Qezelynr, and Aishuq Gardeshi. Few trees are found except around the villages. Despite the ample supply of water from streams and springs there is little cultivation. 3. Climate (a) Winter Quarters In the east temperate, save for a few summer months, and mild in winter. In the western and low-lying areas it is very hot in summer. (b) Summer Quarters . This area is extremely cold with snow lying in most of the area for several months during the winter, The climate is temperate in summer. 4.

In the summer quarters r—Fursimadunv Chehur Mahul Bakhtmri and J'eneki Sardsiri. A common anti-government feeling tends to develop, superficially at least good relations between the tribes. Such relations are strained during the migra. tion periods when the Darrehshuri cross the B«vi, Mamassani and Doshmanziar territories. Their frequent robberies and incursions make the Darrehshuri very unpopular with their Chehttr Mahsl neighbours. THE PEOPLE There is a wide variety of type among the Darrehshuri: the usual dark, lean,, hawk-face, alternating with fair faces with broad features. Health is excellent^ malaria rare, venereal disease unknown and trachoma occasional. Tribal dress is worn more among the Darrehshuri than among other Qashqai ^ sub-tribes that have greater contacts with the towns.. The shepherds and poorer tribesmen are very badly clad and usually wear only a tattered shirt and trousers: covered with a rough wool-felt coat. Above all other Qashqai sub-tribes the Darrehshuri are noted for their fighting and daring. They are keen hunters. The average Darrehshuri Khan is, to the honoured guest, a most hospitable and courteous host. Monogamy is ahnost universal. There is little opium-smoking. The tribesmen speak a mixture of Turki and Persian but almost all can speak the latter as well. Their religion is Shi’ah Islam. Outwardly the Darrehshuri are devout com pared with their Kashkuli neighbours. So far as the youths of the tribe are concerned, education is still in its infancy although some have learnt to read and write and some attend school in the towns. Zi«d and Zaki Khans have expressed a desire to send their sons to Britain or America for their education. STRENGTH Figures supplied by the Darrehshuri khans and other Qashqai sources give a total of 8,070 families for the Darrehshuri sub-tribe. Of these about 3,500 families are nomadic. It is estimated that the Darrehshuri have about 800 good modern rides and a further 1,000 older types and that there are roughly 6,500 fighting men in the tribe. It is doubtful if more than 1,500 of these could be assembled at one time (there wer®- not more than 800 Darrehshuri in action at the 1943 Semirom battle). The Darrehshuri are the best of the Qashqai mounted men. ANALYSIS OF SUB-SECTIONS In the following table details of sub-sections, their numbers, kadkhodai, summer and winter quarters and their allegiance to the four kalantars are given. Numbers are most unreliable as is the case throughout Qashqai. The Khans, including Nuser Khan, reserve one set of figures for the benefit of the Finance Department and another, a most impressive set, for casual enquirers. The towns people produce figures that axe probably exaggeratedly low.. The enemies of ^ Qashqw quote lower figures still. In the case of Darrehshuri the total quoted ranges from 3,000 to 8,000 families. The heads of the sub-sections are frequently changed.28 APPENDIX I.

ORIGIN The ancestors of the Sheshboluki tribe came from th shesh boluk —six districts— of Khaljest'en. Tradition has it that they entered Fa s with the main body of Qash- qai and share their origin. HISTORY In 1918 the Sheshboluki under Ahmad Khan fought the Darrehshuri (partisans of Soulat ed Douleh and opponents of the British). Nevertheless they have been known in the past 25 years as the most loyal of the subjects of the Ilkhvnb. Ahmad Khan remained as head of the tribe until 1933. He was succeeded by his youngest son, Saftar Khan, wdio remained in power until 1939 when he in turn was succeeded by Ami r Teimur Khan. Ahmad Khan was imprisoned for 7 months in Shiraz during 1933. He was re leased as a result of the efforts of Amir Kossein Khan (son of Sardur Ehteshum) and returned to the tribe. During the period when settlement was being enforced in Qashqai the Sheshboluki wisely decamped to the most southerly section of the winter quarters—the Dashti area—where they maintained a semblance of unity and avoided ruin by taking up agriculture. They complain that the Government authorities reduced them to ex tremes of poverty during this period but they actually escaped lightly when compared with the Kashkuli and Darrehshuri. A section of them that continued the migration lost many animals when held over winter in the summer quarters by the Army in 1937. In the summer of 1939 a mysterious illness afflicted the family of the kalantar and four members of his family died in the space of six days—Hossein Qoli Khan (father of Amir Teimur), Amir Khan, Saftar Khan and Elms Khan the son of Saftar. The tribe suspected foul play. With a reputation for loyalty to the Flkhnni the Sheshboluki apparently declared their allegiance to Noser Khan on his return in 1941. Amir Teimur Khan, the Icalan- tar, loses n - opportunity of repeat ing that Noser Khan has whole-hearted Sheshboluki support. This however is far from accurate for other tribal khans resent Noser Khan’s assumption of power, his administrative methods and his obvious desire for personal advancement and gain. But it is true that since his return Noser Khan has kept the Sheshboluki under closer personal control than almost any other section of Qashqai except Amaleh. Some of the khans appear to lean towards Ali Khan Solor Heshmat, brother of Soulat ed Douleh, but Noser Khan certainly commands the allegiance of the Icalantar, Amir Teixnuv, r39 - r Since 1941 the Sheehboluki have grown in numbers to become the largest sub- tribe of Qashqai. They are not so influential as the Darrehshuri nor is Amir Teimur so wealthy, powerful or respected as the Darrehshuri khans. The Sheshboluki have not been involved in any clash with the Government since N'eser Khan’s return and have gained for themselves a reputation for respect ability. This probably means that they have indulged in petty theft rather than mass plundering. They occasionally steal sheep, goats and household goods from their Khamseh neighbours but their disputes are settled through the respective authorities and not by fighting. The Sheshboluki are well spoken of by the rest of the Qashqai tribes who say that they are industrious and comparatively well behaved. They and the Darrehshuri are commonly regarded by the Qashqai ruling family aa the backbone of the Qashqai tribes.

Physical (a) Win'er Quarters The Sheahboluki winter quarters cover a huge area of south-western Fars and physical characteristics vary considerably within the boundaries given above. The northern section (Jerreh, Farreshband, Barmeh, Shi in ykhar etc.) and the western section (Talhak, Bushgnn, Khurmuj, Lcvar (UM45), Shombeh etc.) consist of a series of parallel muontain ridges running from north-west to south-east with rough valleys lying between and connected by transverse gorges and gaps in the mountains. The altitude of the valleys decreases steadily as the Gulf coast is approached : Farrssh- band and Barmeh 2,700 ft. Bushgtm 2,000 ft. Khun, Talhak and Luvar 1,000 ft. ; Khurmui and Shombeh near sea level. Most of the valleys are barren in appearance but some have trees. The construction of the mountains and the shallowness of wells indicates plentiful water below the surface. Springs are few and brackish ; some of the wells are salt. Rivers are small and frequently either salt or sulphurous. The valleys of Farrushband, Bushgim and Dehrud if irrigated would be most fertile as the soil is excellent. At Farreshband more than 200 square miles of flat agricultural land is unused. Apart from the valleys the land is exceedingly rough_and barren. The masses and ridges of mountains are bare and treeless and there are great areas of rolling shale or clay hills, entirely devoid of water. The ruins of former inhabited areas of considerable size and of complex irrigation systems in both the Bushgtsu and Farrnshband valleys indicate that the area was not always unproductive. The southern and eastern sections of the Sheshboluki winter quarters are also made up of roughly parallel lines of hills and valleys but the construction is more broken and irregular. The elevation of the valleys varies from 2, to 3,000 ft. and of the mountains around 6,000 ft. with isolated peaks rising to 8, and 9,000 ft. The only large perennial rivers are the Qara ygh-ech or Hand which forms the southern border and the Rud-e Shur (salt) which runs on the eastern border of Sheshboluki territory. The small Dasht-e Pal an g stream runs south-east from the Bushgsn plain to join the Hand but is dry for most of its length in late summer and is salt.. Springs are few and water, if it exists at all, is underground. The area is largely unexplored. (b) Summer Quarters The Sarhadd-e Chehnrdnngeh in which a large section of the Sheshboluki lives contains the large plain, 10 miles wide at Kushk-e Zard, that runs NKW to the Sheikh-en stream where it is 15 miles wide. It includes the Bnbn Sheikh Ahmad plain, 20 miles in width, stretching north from the Sheikhun stream to Bahmanzud (PW4649). The surface of these plains is uneven, covered with scrub and gum tragacanth. There are many springs near the flanking hills and torrent beds are frequent. The Sheikhnn stream is perennial. The stream that crosses the plain from Deh Kuhid (PW7245) to Han ns is also perennial (this is the continuation of the Rahim stream which flows through Yezd-e Khest (PW78.) Bordering the Chehurdungeh valleys to the east are high mountain ranges; to the east of these the Eqlid valley and the plateau south-west of Bahman (PK1248) as well as the plain through which the Rahim stream flows (around and north of Deh Gerdu (PW8349)] are thickly populated with Sheshboluki. East again of the mountain chain running south-east from Yezd-e Khsst to Eqlid Sheshboluki summer camps are found in the almost waterless foothills which slope down eastwardfl to the Shiraz-Isfahan road.' rThe mountain ranges separating the different valleys in the Sheshboluhi summer quarters are easily crossed by numerous tracks. Ascents are gradual and passes easy going compared with the boulder-strewn gorges to the south-west in the Ardeken and Dez-e Kord districts. 3. Climate (a) Winter Quarters A hot, dry and barren area in summer. Rainfall is low in winter and in the summer heat pasture and vegetation dry up. Ancient irrigation works have fallen into disuse. In winter when the Sheshboluki arrive the climate is mild, rain falls and the valleys provide good pasture. Snow is very rarely seen. Rain-fed cultiva tion is possible in spring. (b) Summer Quarters These northerly valleys are, like most of the Qashqai summer quarters, for the most part under snow in winter. Conditions are too severe for a people that relies on its flocks for its livelihood and cultivates the land only in the early summer when the snows melt and the weather becomes warmer. In mid-summer the area is cool and spring-water is plentiful from the winter snow and rain. 4. Agriculture (o) Winter Quarters In the Fam?shband region agriculture is confined to not more than three settled localities and to Farmhband itself where dates are the chief crop. In addition to dates the area produces citrous fruits in summer and fair crops of wheat, barley, rice and opium in winter and spring. Since about 1920 the population of the area has con tinued to dwindle and underground water channels, wells and irrigation Canals have fallen into disuse,. The region was obviously once very productive and the ruins of several ancient towns and settlements are to be seen. About one per cent of the suitable land is cultivated. (6) Summer Quarters From spring until autumn a small amount of cultivation is carried on in this region but not much of the land belongs to the Sheshboluki tribe who tend to keep to their flocks. They supplement their income with crops of wheat, barley and beans in summer and grow much fruit for their own consumption. This produce is grown mostly around the villages and gaTdens of the khans. COMMUNICATIONS , 1. External.^ (o) Winter Quarters Access to the Sheshboluki winter quarters is impossible for motor transport. Firuzubcd is the nearest.road head to the Farr^shband plain and the villages to the south and west, Fiem Rczerun a stoui[f ar can reach Jerreh (see Appendix|III to Fursimaden) and from there it is a short and easy ride to the Naujin (UG8214) and Famsshband plains. Access to the Bush gun and other central valleys is possible from the Bushire plain by horse from Ahram. ^ (6) Summer Quarters - j Vehicles can reach the summer quarters of the Sheshboluki by the roads Suttaaq- Eqlid (see Appendix III) ybudeh-Kushk-e Zard and ybudeh-^Khosm Shirin: The track fr&amp;m Khosru Shirin north to;Semirom runs through the centre of the Sheshboluki summer quarters.

Internal—Migration The Sheshboluki tribe moves in a mass from its summer to its winter quarter! and in scattered groups from the winter to the summer area. The general line is Kushk-e Zard—Beizu (UC11)—Khun-e Zeniim (UG97) or Cheiver Rabdur (UH!7)-~ Kbun-e Khavis (UH06) or Pirbimu (UH26)—Moshg^n (UG92) or Kavur (UH52)— Farrushband or Firuznbed—thence to camping grounds. An alternative line used since 1941 is Khnn-e Zeniun —F^mur—Farnjshband—dispersal. ORGANIZATION The head of the Sheshboluki is Amir Teimur Khan. He is very much Nsser Khan’s tool and the tribe is therefore largely controlled by Nuser Khan. Amir Teimur Khan is of the family that has held the kaldntar-s\ivp of Sheshboluki for many years (see Appendix II). Under Amir Teimur the khans of the sub-sections keep the sub-tribe in fair order. Although Amir Teimur is far from generally popular, and Nnser Khan still less so among the junior khans, criticism is never open as Nuser Khan could quickly get rid of any chief he disliked in Sheshboluki. The system of holding the heads of sub-sections responsible for the behaviour of their people operatesdn Sheshboluki as it does throughout Qashqai. In the case of Sheshboluki many of the khans of sub-sections are wealthy and semi-independent; four of the sub-sections of Sheshboluki (see ANALYSIS OF SUB SECTIONS) number over 700 families and the kadkhodas enjoy the position and wealth of the average kalantar. Income is derived largely from the flocks. Less of the general income is diverted by the kalantar and his family and the standard of living in the sub-tribe is considered to be high for Qashqai. Amir Teimur and the rest of his family are poor and unianded by Qashqai standards. ECONOMIC The Sheshboluki are said to possess the greatest wealth in flocks of all Qashqai. During Reza Shah s reign the group that settled in the winter quarters seems to have managed to keep up its numbers and maintain its economic standing. The number of families was estimated at 4—5,000 in 1918 which is similar to the 1945 figure. Only in the summer quarters do the Sheshboluki do any large-scale farming and the sale of wheat, barley and fruit forms a very small part of their tribal income. General living conditions are the highest to be found in any Qashqai sub tribe. The subordinate khans are as a rule better dressed than their equivalents in other sub-tribes and are reputedly not rapacious. • The tribespeople are more pros perous and healthy—looking than any others in Qashqai. They are industrious, have incomes above the average and spend freely. Their income formely depended largely on the Yezd market to which the Shesh boluki were accustomed to take their flocks for sale and barter in exchange for cloth, tea, sugar and household goods. Isfahan also was a market for their produce. Nt?ser Khan stopped this trade on the grounds that the tribe’s economy should be confined bo the province of Fars with the result that they turned for trade to Eqlid, ybudeh and Several sub-sections of Sheshboluki, particularly Haibatlu and Kuhi, are famous for their rugs. These are mostly for home use but many find their way into the bazaars. *** bf i&amp;! mi y-nr thorr \9c» t Sales therefore are of sheep and goats and their wool, fat, meat, etc. Grain col lected in the summer quarters is also marketed. Purchases are principally monopoly goods, household and leather goods.Prior to 1941 the Government exacted an annual tax from Sheshboluki of ap proximately 50,000 tomans. Subsequently the tribe paid no taxes officially but Nutter Khan levied an annual tax on animals and this was paid in kind. A tax is paid to the Government on all goods sold in controlled market centres. RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURS (a) Winter Quarters North-east .. North-west ..

Amaleh and smaller sub-tribes in the Shesh Nvhieh district. The Khamseh neighbours of Sheshboluki claim that petty theft and cattle rustling never cease throughout the summer. The Khamseh are probably more guilty than the Sheshboluki of such robberies. The Bnseri and Sheshboluki share the Pt?bisheh Namdun plain (UC29) and are on excellent terms. The Kordshuli are also friendly with Sheshboluki. Other sub-tribes of Qashqai give the Sheshboluki a good pamo and they have a record of good behaviour in Ears. Relations with Darrehshuri and Kasbkuli appear to be satisfactory but Sheshboluki have a quarrel of long standing with their lawless neighbours the F^rsimadun which Nuser Khan has attempted to settle. Sheshboluki are generally on good terms with the people of Tangestun and Dashti but encroachments by the coastal peoples on to Sheshboluki land or theft by the Qashqai tribesmen are a recurring source of quarrels. THE PEOPLE Together with the Darrehshuri the Sheshboluki provide the best physical types in Qashqai. The average tribesman is short and stocky. He has the Qashqai coloirring, dark hair and complexion with brown eyes but a few of the fair-haired type mentioned under Darrehshuri occur particularly among the khans. These people are the most industrious members of the Qashqai tribe, making the most of their flocks and supplementing their income by such activities as gathering gum tragacanth while in their summer quarters. They are noted as brave and daring fighters, particularly on foot. 6 There is a high incidence of malaria in Sheshboluki but apart from trachoma they are otherwise very healthy. STRENGTH Although Darrehshuri strength is quoted at 8,070 and Sheshbolaki at 7,000 families it is believed that Sheshboluki is the bigger tribe. The total of 7,600 families given by Nnser Khan can be cut down by comparison with information from other sources to a minimum total of 4,000 nomadic families. There are probably as many as 5,000 fighting men in Sheshboluki. Malek Mansur Khan, brother of Nnser Khan, makes the much exaggerated claim of 7,000 fighters. The Sheshboluki tribesmen are notoriously slow in assembling for battle and it is unlikely that more than 2,000 fighting men could be mustered from the tribe at one time. MeTArmyAPPENDIX I—PERSONALITIES Amir Teimur Khan .—Born about 1915. Eldest son of Hossein Qoli Khan. Kalantar of Sheshboluki. Of medium height, heavily built, dark complexioned. Has been Jcalantar since 1939. Nuser Khan describes him as either “ very young ” or “ too young ” but admits that he is efficient. Although uneducated and seemingly ill- mannered and inhospitable, he has a reputation for straight dealing, veracity and honesty. He is poorly dressed compared with th£ average Qashqai Jcalantar and does not share their prosperity although his tribe is the wealthiest in Qashqai. Hossein Khan .—Bom about 1921. The eldest son of Saftar Khan who died in 1939. Saftar Khan was formerly Jcalantar of Sheshboluki. Slim and slightly above medium height. Is described by other members of the tribe as being highly intelligent and, in conversation, gives the impression of being so.

Firuzvbvd to Ahram (UN48) Maps : H39W. Jul ’41. H39V, 1940. Total distance : 125 miles. General The construction of a road through Ahram to Firuznbnd has often been advanced as an alternative to the existing road from Bushire through K^zerun to Shiraz. Th© alignment of the K'ezerun road was dictated by the immediate needs of military opera tions (in 1917) and in the Kotal-e Dokhtar, Pir-e Zan and Rudak includes three difficult and entirely unnecessary passes. Although a road built through Ahram and Firuz-ob^d would not present the difficulties that confronted the constructors of the K'ezerun road it would include two major problems in the Tang-e Behush and the Tang-e Siakhi. Some claim that the Tang-e Behusb can be avoided by going eastward and that an alternative to the Tang-e Siakhi is also available. But until the whole area has been thoroughly surveyed and accurately mapped the possible alternative routes from Ahram to Firuz^bcd will remain a matter of speculation. In any case the cost of constructing an alternative to the Kezerun road is likely to be very considerable indeed and there appears to be no early prospect of any Persian Administration s having the money to spare for a major work in a remote part of an outlying province that, with the increasing centralization of affairs in the capital seems to be doomed to neglect. * Nnser Khan Qashqai has declared that he is, in principle, in favour of the con struction of roads wherever they may be. Tribal khans and tribesmen in the area affected however ha ve expressed opposition to the copstruction of a road from Ahram to Firuz'eb'ed. This attitude arises out of their fear of Government intentions and their attachment to a nomadic existence. If the tribes became settled they would doubtless eventually favour the construction of roads. The route described below was covered in November 1945 before the first winter rains. Shiraz to Bushire by Firuznbcd and Abram is roughly 225 miles compared with 183 miles by way of Kazerun. The route was covered on horseback and is only motorable at the points indicated in the text.

The khans state 1 hat the tribe came ofipinally from the Tehran area (where other branches are still to be found) to Kuligalu near Behbeh'en and from there moved into Fars joining the Qashqai federation at some period prior to the rule of Kerim Khan Zand. As regards their name the present Khans, contradicting Christian, hold that, coming from the Tehran area, the tribespeople could speak Fcrsi and were therefore known as Fursi-mi-d«n. RECENT HISTORY The kalantars of the Farsimadan sub-tribe since 1918 have been as follows : 1918 .. .1. Zaki Khan 1918-32.. .. Massih Khan 1932-34.. .. Mansur and Zolfaqir Khans 1934-37.. .. Mansur Khan 1937-40.. .. Gholvni RtzvKhan 1940-41.. .. Hossein Khan 1941- . .. Hossein and Zarir Khans. About 1916 the two leading khans, Zaki and Massih, were imprisoned by Soulat ed Douleh for what he considered an act of treachery (committed by them at the instance of Avaz Kikhn Darrehshuri) but on their release they supported Soulat ed Douleh against the British. During the hostilities Massih Khan was wounded by Ali Khan S^lur Heshmat (uncle of Nuser Khan Qashqai) an act that has not been forgotten by his, Massih’s, sons. The tribe took part in the 19!&gt;0 Qashqai revolt. In 1932 Massih Khan and h s eldest son, Anrunollah, were removed to Tehran and detained there ; Massih Khan died in Tehran shortly afterwards. When the migration was prohibited approximately 1,000 families settled in the summer quarters and the remainder in the winter quarters. In 1937 the tribe loft many animals when they were forced by the army to abandon them in Kamfiruz. Since the return of Nuser Khan the Fursimadun, although professing loyalty to him, have given him little real support. They were poorly represented in the fighting for Firuzub^d and later at Semirom. They took the opportunity of looting freely in the Jerreh district. During the winter 1943-44 they were accused of robbery and petty thieving as far north as Klmi-e Zeninn. They gave moral support at least to the brigand yqs Jun Dabli who operated in the Kemnrej area. Since the surrender of yqu Jen little has been heard of them and they have not been guilty of any crime greater than routine pilfering and sheep-stealing. The Fursimaden have little importance. They are small in numbers and the fact that they are poor may account for their bad reputation for theft. Zmd Khan Darrehshuri has stated that given-support by the British the Fursimadun would com bine with the Kashkuli and Darrehshuri against Nuser Khan. There are however no indications of this dissension in the tribe where the khans, 1 particularly Zarir Khan, declare their loyalty and allegiance to Nuser Khan. According to reports received from the tribe-N^ser Khan has little control over Fersimaden, in the autumn of 1943 he gave them 30,000 tomans as a subsidy for their agriculture in order to keep them from robbing.The Ftirsinwdvn arc a lawless group and probably would prefer the conditions in Fars to continue than that they should settle down to a life of peace and agriculture. They have a tradition of friendship with the Darrehshur, and where the latter lead the Ft?rsimad*n would probably follow.

In the winter quarters they may extend beyond the given boundaries for a distance of up to ten miles. 1.

Peak 8400 along ridge of Kuh-e Dem? to B5090. The above boundaries are approximate : the area included is known as P^dena but the Fcisiinadtm are spread out also towards Dez-e Kord. East North .. West South .. 2. Physical (а) Winter Quarters This area consists of a series of valleys running roughly from north-west to south east. The intervening mountains are precipitous except for the Ki^e Buzpar and the mountain on the other side of the valley to the northeast of Kuh-e Buzpar. The western section is almost devoid of vegetation apart from the immediate vicinity of a few springs: even the river banks are bare. The mountains rise in a series of great tilted slabs to Kuh-e Nakhu and Kuh-e Gisaksn. To the east the valleys open out into the plains of Femur, Jerreh and Farreshband. The first twothese plains are wellwatered as is the Dedin (Duain) valley (G64). In all three the soil js fertile and the foothills are covered with rich grazing and trees. The river Deleki flows north-west and then west across Fersimaden territory and is joined by the Ferieb that comes in from the south. (б) Summer Quarters Lying immediatelv to the north-east and north of the 14i000-fb6t peak*s of Kuh-e Dena this region is well-watered by streams and springs and consists of a rolling fertile valley three miles wide and running north and north-west and then west. It is difficult of access except from the east at ysopus and Khosm Shirin. The mountains are almost devoid of vegetation, except for scrub and thorn. The river Sangbur that flows in the valley waters the whoR area. .56 3. Climate (а) 'Wiiiter Quarters The area is mild in winter with a rainfall of from 12-14 inches but it is on ressively hot in summer, the Duain valley being particularly unpleasant. Malaria very prevalent. (б) Summer Quarters In winter this region is bitterly cold with many feet of snow lying on the grourd for several months. The area is very difficult of access except in summer when it is cool and temperate. It is malaria free. 4. Agriculture (a) Winter Quarters Except in the well-watered Duain (G64) valley and that part of the Jerreh plain in Fursimadun hands little attempt is made at agriculture in the winter quarters. Wheat, barley and opium are among the products grown and rice is extensively cultivated in the Duain valley. Fruit and vegetables are scarce. The total annual cereals crop from this area is estimated at 60,000 kilos. (fc) Summer Quarters The Vvdenis district, although mainly barren mountains, contains a number of fertile strips of land in the valleys where crops of wheat and barley are grown to gether with a wide variety of fruit. Estimated cereals production is 150 tons annually. COMMUNICATIONS 1. External (a) Winter Quarters The rough motorable route from Kuzerun to Siruzjun (UG8132) is the only means of access by motor transport in this area and even this only reaches the fringe of the F'ersimad'en winter camping grounds. Other animal-transport tracks from Bushire through Ahram to Famish band etc. have not been explored for several yMrs. For a detailed report on the KBzerun-Sirazjim and Ahram-Firu- zubud routes see Appendix III. (6) Summer Quarters r The easiest means of access to the Farsimadun summer quarters is by the motor- Vb ! d £ h to , Kho Z' ShiTin &lt; s,,mmer oal y) ‘hence horse to Shahid (W3904) and Dorruh™ (W2804) in the Pedena area. Another and more difficult route is by Ardekun by motor transport and thence to Pudena via Komehr and Kekun. 2. Internal (Migration) The general line of migration of the Fursimadtra sub-tribes from winter to summer quarters is as follows :— Amluk (G7934)—SirBzjun (G8131)—Moshgun (G9529)—Chenur Furiub (G9759&gt; --Khan-e Zennm—Kudren (G99)—Beizu—Tang-e Tir (Tur) (C0526)—Kamfiruz— KhunimBn (B9254) Dez-e Kord and Padenu. Approximately 2,000 families migrate; the remainder spend the year either in the summer or winter quarters. (A very few families spend winter in the Pvdenu district).ORGANIZATION Zarir and Hossein Khans are regard'd in the tribe as Mavtars. They have been appointed apparently by agreement between the khans of the two main f; milies The fact that they ore of distinctly different temperaments (see Appendix I) may account partially for the lack of discipline in the tribe. . ^ The system of appointing heads of sub-sections (kadkhodas) in Far imrdrn appears to bo very lax. Control is usually divided among a number of head men (the effect being a complete lack of any firm authority) below the Jcalantars who themselves* keep anything but good control of their subordinates. The Jcalantars declare that they live on the produce of their own lands and exact no taxes. Administration throughout the tribe is disorganised. ECONOMIC * • t ^ e ° f tbe rev t nue from Fersimadun was os' : nrted at 120,000 rials but it is said that no more than 40,000 rials ever reached th* Government The tribe is very poor and the khans compare most unfa* ourably in their way of life and standard of living with the rest of the Qashqai Khans Thev P™ 0 ^ 11 ? fc y unWful mean ; to remedv thi , The majn 0 ^ of income of the tribe is from the sale of sheep. Profits are also made from the sale of other cattle, animal fats and wool. The produce of the land wheat barlev lice, opium, etc., makes up only a small portion of their income. ’ ’ The principal market centres are Kezerun and Shiraz in winter and vbsdeh in summer. v uau Conditions in Persimadan are very bad by Qashqai standards. Poverty and dirt are general and the people are poorly fed, clothed and cared for. 7 RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURS (o) Winter Quarters East North West South Settled villages Jerreh, Sirrrjan, etc. »» *» F«mur, Kemr-rej, etc. *» &gt;» Dvleki, Boruzjan, etc. »* •• and Sheshboluki.

He is dark, frequently markedly so, possibly as a result of links with the coastal areas. Light brown colouring in hair and eyes is occasionally seen. There appears to be no desire among this sub-tribe to settle down to a more stable and peaceful existence. In their habits and way of life the Fvrsimaden show themselves to be more ignorant and less civilised than the rest of the Qashqai nomads. They are dirty and diseased : trachoma is frequently found and malaria very prevalent ; venereal disease is rare. The lack of discipline, casual mode of living and far frem industrious nature of the F^rsimadun make them compare unfavourablj with the rest of Qashqai. Religion is Shi’ah Islam but little attention is paid to its observance. Educa tion is neglected even more than in other sub-tribes. STRENGTH The total of Fursimadnn nomads is about 2,170 families. This figure was ob tained from the kalavtars and other khans. Neser Khan gives a much higher total which probably includes the Qashqai who have settled in the Fumur and Jerreh districts during the past 30 years. The Fursimaden are poorly armed and are not reckoned by Nuser Khan to be a fighting! sub-tribe. Although there are probably 1,500 fighting men in the tribe not more than one third of that number could be assembled at once. The tribe possesses about 500 rifles of which about 150 are good modern weapons. ANALYSIS OF SUB-SECTIONS Details in the following table include the names of sub-sections, kadkhodas or head men (see ORGANIZATION), numbers of each sub-section and summer and winter quarters. The usual inaccuracies also exist in this table. Map references of locations not known on existing maps have been calculated from directions given by tribesmen and should therefore be treated as approximate. s.60 APPENDIX I.

They were recruited from all the sub-tribes and formed the Ilkhvni’s bodyguard as well as his “ household cavalry ” retainers and personal servants. They were under the direct control of the Ilkhvni himself. HISTORY. The original Amaleh group of tribes people has developed in the last thirty years into a much larger and less well defined conglomeration. Its history is the history of many of the sub-tribes of Qashqai that were once important units but have now been reduced to poverty or dwindled in number. In 1918 the number of the Amaleh was estimated at 2,000 families, made up of about 800 families of personal retainers and servants and 1,000 families supplying bodyguards. This nucleus was the real Amaleh and still exists. One result of the oppressions of Pahlevi’s reign and the consequent decline in Qashqai fortunes and numbers was that the smaller independent tribes found them selves isolated from the main body of Qashqai and less able to offer even passive resistance to the Army’s efforts at annihilating Qashqai as a coherent group. These smaller tribes consequently joined the Amaleh. They were not servants, bodvguard or retainers but they renounced their independence, the kalantars gave up their rights and absolute authority over these small tribes was offered to the Ilkhvni (-ttho was at that time a prisoner in Tehran). Although the much increased Amaleh was thus without a leader of any sort they migrated and lived together and were treated by the Government authorities as a united group similar to Shesh- boluki etc. The total of the Amaleh tribes thus reached about 4,000 families. Of these possiblv half settled during Pahlevi’s reign and after his abdication many of the tribes sent only a small portion of their number on migration. Nnser Khan incorrectly describes many tribes as Amaleh ; in reality only one quarter, or less, of * the number he quotes migrates with the Amaleh and the remainder is permanently Since his escape from Tehran and return to the tribe N^ser Khan has gradually incorporated all the small independent tribes except ten, in the Amaleh, under hia own personal control. These tribes have lost their kalantars, and the kadhodas have become directly responsible to Nnser Khan. The word Amaleh thus at present describes a tribe composed of an accumulation of smaller tribes, the. nucleus of which, known as the “ Daur-e Khaneh ”, performs the duties of original Amaleh. There is every indication that Nnser Khan keeps tight control over these particular tribespeople. He claims to be able to muster about 6000 fighting men from them but this is a gross exaggeration as at least half of the Amaleh are settled or have only remote contacts with him. Some of the total quoted under STRENGTH are probably Persian villagers who till the land on the Qashqai family estates* From the remainder it is estimated that Ncser Khan might be able to call togethei 1,500 armed men. settled.

It is not possible to fix any boundaries for the territory covered by the Amaleh tribes. They are as a rule roughly grouped round Nuser Khan’s own camp at a distance of up to 50 miles. N^ser Khan pitches his summer camp first at Chul Qafs then at Semirom or Khosru Shirin, then at Kushk-e Zard, south of Khosru Shirin or at Dez-e Kord and finally at BeizR. The Amaleh thus wander over the large plain south and south-west of Semirom, nearly into the P'edenu district, south across the Hanne valley and theCheherdungeh (Sheshboluki) plain into the plains south and south-west of Khosru Shirin. They are found in the east in the Shesh Nuhieh dis trict and around Eqlid, Kushk-e Zard and ysopns according to the location of Ntfser Khan’s camp. In winter also the Amaleh are continually on the move and penetrate territory occupied by the large independent sub-tribes. They are grouped around Firuzebnd and Simaknn (UN67) (not marked on the existing map) eastwards into the Afzar and Qir and Kurzin plains, around Sarguh (shared with Buseri) and in the Khonj plain. Someofthetribesof Amaleh penetrate as far south as Gallehdnr, Alumerv- dasht, Riz and Jam (40 miles from the Gulf coast). 2 . Physical. (а) Winter Quarters. This southern area consists of the rough Firuznb^d plain and the high Simakran valley (UN67) in the west an arid country watered by wells and springs and flanked by high, bare mountain ridges. To the east the land flattens out to the low-lying Qir and Krarzin plain and the Afzar lowland, well watered by the Mand river but, owing to the lack of irrigation works, a desert in summer. The hills here are low and gently sloping, the plains level. Further east is the wide flat plain of Sargsh and Heram, a bare desert throughout the year except for areas near the Mand river and occasional wells. To the south-east stretches the Khonj plain, more barren still in Bummer but providing grazing near the rain-fed springs and wells most of which dry up in the early summer. Further south are the rough and barren mountain ridges that run parallel to the coast with a few poorly watered valleys, such as those of Gallehdur and Al-emervdasht, lying between them. To the south-east these hills link up with the mountain mass around L^r. (б) Summer Quarters. CO The SheshNehieh (6 districts) of the Qashqai summer quarters are Vardasht (Darrehshuri summer territory), Upper Pudene (Qaracheh summer territory), Lower Pudene (Fursimadun summer territory), Semirom, Yanak and Khosru Shirin. The three last-named districts are part of the Amaleh summer quarters. ^ The Semirom plain is roughly 200 square miles in area and is by far the most fertile district in the Qashqai summer quarters. It is very well watered by streams and springs and cultivation is, for Qashqai, extensive. Semirom, with a population of 12,000, is the wealthiest and most important town in the Qashqai summer quarters. (n) South-east of Semirom a low col gix es access to the north-western corner of the main valley of the Chehnrdnngeh district. About ten miles in width in the north, this valley gradually rises and broadens towards the south. The Rahim etream enters it from the north-west and flows out through a gap in the western hills, past Hannu towards Pedene where it links up with the Khersen. South of the Rahim river the valley is wider and rises in undulations; there are no perennial streams here but many springs in the foothills to east and west. The ground is dry and covered with shrub and gum-plants in summer and with grass in spring*About 20 miles south of the Rahim stream the ground begins to slope down to the Sbeikhtfn stream and its tributaries. The plain then bends a little to the east and becomes level. It is here about 15 miles wide. A narrow gorge (dry in summer) carries a road through the mountain barrier on the west to the Khosru Shirin valley and the lowlands beyond. The plain finally narrows and ends in a mountain wall about 18 miles to the south-east. (m) A gap, about ten miles in width, in the mountain chain to the east of the valley mentioned above, gives access to the broad plain that runs 20 miles south-east to Kushk-e Zard. This plain becomes an oval-shaped basin, watered by the Shei-. khsn river, about 12 miles in width, narrows down to three miles just south-east of Kushk-e Zard and then broadens out into the P. bisheh Namdun plain. Throughout it is flat and covered ’with coarse grass in summer and good grazing in spring. The mountains enclosing the valley are steep and bare but a series of low passes and level valleys north and north-east of Sheikht n (PX 01) gives easy access to the ybvdeb plain. (tv) The Khosru Shirin plain is rough y 100 square miles in area. It is well watered by a network of perennial streams and although the surface of the plain is undulating it is an ideal site for agriculture and the soil is very fertile. Except round Khosru Shirin village there is no cultivation in this area. 3. Climate. (o) Winter Quarters In winter this area has a cool mild climate with a moderate rainfall. It has a warm spring and a very hot summer when the ground becomes parched. The area has a few springs and wells and one perennial river, the Mand. (6) Summer Quarters The high valleys of the north are cool in summer with cold nights. Although there is no summer rainfall the severe winters with much snow and rain and the fact that many of the mountains are snow-capped until mid-summer, ensure copious supplies of water from the many springs. The cold in winter is extreme and com pletely prevents agriculture or the pasturing of livestock. 4 . Agriculture. (а) Winter Quarters In the south many families of the Amaleh are settled near Qir, K^rzin, Afzar, Firuzvb'ed and Simakvn, where they share the agricultural pursuits of the native Persian peasants. Other Amaleh groups farm the Qashqai family lands and the estates of other wealthy khans. Crops of rice, wheat, barley, maize, opium, tobacco, dates, oranges, cotton etc., are reaped in the summer and autumn and further crops of cereals and vegetables in winter and spring. The area i$ very productive, particu larly the Qir plain. The Firuzabud and Simakva regions are those most favoured by the Qashqai for settlement as the climate is not too severe in summer but they compare very poorly with the hot, low-lying plains to the east in fertility and water supply. (б) Summer Quarters The Beizu plain is owned by Shiraz landlords and its agriculture is not a factor in Qashqai economy. The districts to the north are too cold in winter to grow cereals or vegetables and the inhabitants of such villages as Semirom (pop. 12,000) live throughout the winter on the summer’s produce. In summer there is considerable cultivation around the springs that emerge from the hills at Semirom, Khosru Shirin, Dez-e Kord and the Kushk-e Zard and ysopus valleys. These crops axe farmed by the resident Persians and the Amaleh keep mostly to their flocks while in the area. Several small villages are owned by Amaleh tribespeople or their khans &gt;in the north and they leave behind a number of the tribe to tend to them in winter.74. COMMUNICATIONS 1. External For notes on roads giving access to Semirom, Khosru SLirin, Kuslik-e 7ard ysopra and Eqlid, in the summer quarters of Amaleh and Firuzubud and Khoni in the winter quarters, see QASHQAI—COMMUNICATIONS. It is reported that trucks can be driven within a few miles of Qir from Firuznbud The desert, south of Jahrom and w r est of Juyom is flat and a motor vehicle could* reach any encampment on that plain, possibly as far as south as Afzar (not mapped but approximately U02220). 2. Internal (Migration). The migration route of the Amaleh tribes is as follows:—From summer to winter quarters : Semirom—Khosru Shirin—Dez-e Kord—Garmeh—Kamfiruz Beizn Khun-e Zenhm or Chennr Rvhdur—Khnn-e Khavis—Siakh—Shurnb Firuznbed Rudbul—Khavis—Afzar—Qir—Kurzin—Alcmervdasht—Khonj and other winter quarters. ORGANIZATION. As explained under HISTORY Nsser Khan is personally head of the Amaleh tribes and through his assistants performs the duties normally delegated to a tribal kalantar. Under Neser Khan the heads of the various sub-sections administer the affairs of their tribespeople and pass on the instructions of the chief who arbitrates in quarrels and disputes between sub-sections. When called upon these heads must produce a fixed number of armed men or labourers to farm an estate for the Qashqai family. Nuser Khan takes a share of the produce of the farms the Amaleh own in the south and the kadfchodas are responsible for appointing a group to remain behind for such farming. Similar arrangements hold with regard to the lands owned in the northern area. The true Amaleh, the Daur-e Khvneh, numbering about 500 families are invari ably camped round Noser Khan’s tent. They provide his escort and personal ser vants and are responsible for moving and pitching his camp, the care of his horses etc. They provide mounted messengers for delivering his correspondence and in general see to his needs and personal comfort. ECONOMIC. General conditions in Amaleh vary greatly from sub-section to sub-section. Many of these tribespeople are industrious and correspondingly prosperous ; others are by nature thieves. The Gallehzan sub-tribe, for instance, has a bad record for its illegal activities and for the squalor of its living conditions. The Amaleh on the whole occupies the best land both in summer and winter quarters of the Qashqai and a larger percentage of its people are settled and till the land than is the case with any other sub-tribe. In general, conditions among them are as good as the best in Qashqai as represented by the Sheshboluki. Incomes are derived principally from the herds and flocks but the settled groups whom Nuser Khan regards as part of his people and whom he taxes, sell large crops of cereals, fruit, cotton, etc., in southern markets which include Lur, Jahrom, Firuzcb^d and Shiraz. In the north the Amaleh trades principally in Eqlid, ysopus and ybttdeh. Of all crops Nsser Khan takes one fifth as his due and exacts a similar levy on sheep and goats. All these taxes are taken in kind and sold. Nuser Khan claims7$ that this part of his income is scarcely sufficient to pay for the medicines, seed, food in bad seasons and other assistance that he freely hands out when required. All the same his income from this source is undoubtedly very great. The Amaleh do not pay any Government taxes except on goods sold in market areas. RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURS. (a) Summer Quarters.

Sheshboluki North and East .. fiBseri (Khamsrh). The Amaleh thus have contacts with all the main tribes of Qashqai and with the Bused section of Khamseh. In general these relations are very good for there seems to be a tendency among the other tribes to leave Nuser Khan’s people alone. Nuser Khan has close control over the Amaleh and when their mb deeds are reported by other tribes the dispute is usually quickly settled to the satisfaction of all. Seme of the other sub-tribes of Amaleh tend to give not only the whole Amaleh group, but all Qashqai a worse reputation for lawlessness than they deserve. The Gallehzan were notorious thieves until 1943 and the Chegenni continually steal from neighbouring villagers and tribes. Otherwise the Amalehare well-behaved and on good terms with their neighbours. THE PEOPLE. A great variety of types is to be found in the different sub-tribes so that the Amaleh, as a whole, have no well-defined appearance, habits or characteristics. STRENGTH, In the following analysis the strength of Amaleh is given as 9,095 families. Taking into consideration the number of settled people in each sub-tribe and the fact that some of the sub-tribes are almost entirely engaged on agriculture it is estimated that not more than 4,000 families can be reckoned as truly nomadic. The rest may be considered to have cut their connexions with Qashqai to such an extent that they are no longer interested in the tribe’s survival as an independent body. Force of cirumstances and their habitat obliges them to owe nominal alle- gience to Nuser Khan. The Amaleh tribes—or at least those that migrate in company with Neser Khan’s household—are better armed than any other group in Qashqai. It is esti mated that there are about 800 modern rifles and 1,600 older weapons among the Amaleh. Of these possibly 2,000 are in the possession of the migratory sections and the rest are held by settled groups for security purposes. This would give Nsser Khan about 1,500 armed men under his personal command. DETAILED ANALYSIS OF SUB-TRIBES AND SUB-SECTIONS. In the following table the names of the sub-tribes of* Qashqai that have joined the Amaleh are given in capitals while those in ordinary type are the original Amaleh sub-sections and other miscellaneous elements that have assumed tribal names. In each group the number of families, head (Jcadkhoda) summer and winter quarters are given together with remarks on points of general interest. All figures should be considered in the light of the comments made in STRENGTH above and should be regarded as approx mate. MSTArmy Remrrk'ri ;n IP’8 by Capt.on Christia-i independent•76 ANALYSIS OF SUB-TRIBES 479 KASHKULI (Kashkuli Bororg). ORIGIN. There are two explanations of the name Kashkuli : one gives as its origin the custom of the Kashkuli khans in former times cf having a Jcashhd (water carrier) to follow them, the other that the ancestors of the tribe included several renowned dervishes and that the tribe took its name fiom the dervishes’ bowl (kashkul). Known history dat-es from the late 18th century* when Hossein yq« Zand, accompanied by his sons, Hassan yqv and Mohammad yqv, came from the Kermtm- shah region with Kerim Khan Zand to Shiraz. Nazli Bibi, daughter of Hossein yqv, married J ni Khan, first Ilkhtmi of Qashqai. J ni Khan divided the Kashkuli tribe, at that time composed of the Ali Qiclu, the Ycdekurlu, the Dezekh-anlu and the yroqlu between the sons of Hassan yq*B and Mohnirmad yqc (see Appendix II), The tribe then was re-divided into three sections, Kashkuli Bozorg, Kermnni (Kuchek ) and Qaracheh ; the remains .of all three survive to the present day ; the descendants of the original’ khans are the kalantars. The Kermeni (Kuchek) and Qaracheh sections, although nominally independent, are very closely attached to Kashkuli Bozorg and are under close control of the Kashkuli Bozorg khans. The Kashkuli claim that as a result of the action of Mostafa Qoli Khan, IIkh«ni, in imprisoning two Kashkuli khans Ht?ji Abbus Ali and Mehdi Qoli—Qusem Khan Zand, with the assistance of the Darreh- shuri, overthrew him and became Ilkh-eni. He held the position until his death in 1850, when he was succeeded by Mohammad Qoli Khan, son of Jtmi Khan. RECENT HISTORY Soulat ed Douleh dealt extremely harshly with the Kashkuli when he became llkhvni. As a result the khans supported the British during the 1914-18 war and fought the Ilkhmi’s men. Mohammad Ali Khan, father of Elies Khan, particularly distinguished himself and Mohammad Khan, father of Jehengir, died of wounds received in the fighting against the Qashqai. Consequently when he again had close control over the tribe in 1921 (Neser Khan being official llkhtmi) Soulat took his revenge on Kashkuli by detaining the khans who had sided against him in the fighting (including Elies and Jehengir), appointed his own puppet khans and deliberately set out to break up and impoverish the Kashkuli tribe. The Kashkuli have never really recovered from this period of oppression. In 1921 certain Kashkuli khans (Elies, Abol Fath, Hedi, Ardeshir and Fathollab) concluded an agreement with the A.I.O.C., which was operating in the Bikarz area, by which the Kashkuli were paid for the use of the land and for the provision of guards. Soulat ed Douleh, however, with the support of the Minister of War, had this agreement cancelled and himself signed a new one with the A.I.O.C. This in turn was cancelled when his puppet kalantars, Ghokm Hossein and Esfandmr Khans, incited an attack on the A.I.O.C. officials in the area. During the 1930 Qashqai revolt the Kashkuli took part in the fighting against the Government. Eliss Khan was prominent in the encounter at Pol-e Khun near Mervdasht. As a result Elirs and Esfandiur Khans were exiled. In Reza Shah’s time the tribe was faced with three alternatives : settlement in the summer quarters, settlement in the winter quarters or the payment of huge bribes to corrupt Govern ment officials. If they adopted the first course their flocks would die off in winter ; if the second they would face ruin in summer in the blistering heat of the arid Mehlutun region. They were thus forced to pay the bribes and this, combined with the effects cf Soulat ed Douleh’s oppression, impoverished the tribe. The khans lost all their power and many fell into debt. Their people broke up and scattered, many settling m poverty and squalor in the winter quarters. Although similar treatment wag accordtd to the rest of Qashqai few suffered to the same degree as Kashkuli,HO Together wit]-, the Darrehslmri and Sheshholuki and Kashkuli were forced to abandon a large number of animals in the winter quarters in 1937. After Reza Shah’s downfall the khans (ireluding Ahmad Khan) attempted to Forestall the possible return of any member of Soulat edDouleh’s family (?'.&lt;?., Nsser Khan) and in company with Darrehshuri representatives a] preached Amir Hossein Khan, son of Sard'ar Ehtesh^m, and offered hini their support if he would assume the leadership of the Qashqai. (Amir Hossein Khan maintains that the offer was made prior to September 1941 and that he refused to accept). In any case the offer was refused and w r hen Ntfser Khan returned the Kashkuli did not oppose him as they realised the necessity for unity in epposition to the Government. During General Shrchbakhti's operations at Kavnr the Kashkuli supported Nnser Khan in opposing the attempt to capture Firuzsbcd. Few Kashkuli troops fought the Government troops at Semirom in 1943 but the khans openly acknowledge participation. Since 1943 the Kashkuli have not been involved in any fighting against the Government or large-scale banditry. Elius and Jehungir Khans were made responsible for the ■security of the Khesht, Shuhpur, Ftmiur, and Kuhmarreh districts and Fathollah Khan for the Komehr and K-ek-en districts in the summer quarters. Some of the more undisciplined sections of the Kashkuli such as the Abolv rdi have made this an excuse for taking protection money from all travellers on the roads in these areas. Isolated bands have continued to indulge in robbery and hold-ups. In the west Ntfder and Fereidun Khans co-operate with the A.I.O.C. and ensure security in the oilfields. The Kashkuli show signs of recovering some of their wealth and numbers and since 1941 the khans have exercised some influence in Qashqai internal and external affairs. The general tendency of the tribe seems to be towards agriculture and settle ment, peace and security. Complaints have been heard that in the settled areas of Ardekun etc., the Army has been resorting once more to enforcing payment of bribes and has thus made life difficult for the settled tribesmen. TERRITORY (a) Winter Quarters Q-esem Khan when Jcalantar, was responsible for obtaining the present Kashkuli winter quarters. Previously they had wintered in the region south of Firuzebud. The original inhabitants of the Mvhur-Mehlutun district (the present winter quarters) the Mohammad Silehi of Mamassani and the Kheshtis, were incorporat ed under Kashkuli administration. 1.

Physical (а) Winter Quarters In the south-west there is an area of low clay and gypsum hills ribbed with sandstone ridges and deeply carved by river gullies. Altitude ranges between 2 and 3,000 feet. Vegetation is sparse with occasional plane trees. This is oil-bearing country. In the north-east a well-defined mountainous area (4, —5,000 feet) forms the eastern, e nd part of the southern, boundary of the winter quarters. The country is very rough and precipitous with the gorge of the swiftly flowing Zohreh river cutting across it from east to west. Apart from this river and the Shshpur stream the water supply consists mostly of small brackish streams and water-holes which frequently dry up in summer. The tribe depends on sweet springs for its drinking water. a (б) Summer Quarters The Ardektm, Komehr and Knk^n districts extending north-westwards towards Tol-e Khosru and north-eastwards in the direction of Dez-e Kord (UB6893) make up a very high (7,-10,000 feet), broken mountain area. Broad, high, well-watered valleys lie between the precipitious mountain ridges and tracks lead through narrow, difficult gorges and over steep passes. There is a plentiful water supply throughout the summer from many streams and springs and the soil is fertile. The hills are wooded with nut and gum-bearing trees. Komehr itself, population 800, is situated at the south-eastern end of a very fertile valley running from south-east to north-west. This is two miles long and a mile wide and is very well watered by the Tiptipi River which leaves the plain by the Tang-e Mazandertm ultimately to join the Kur River. Around the plain are moun tains ; the valley is very fertile and produces crops of wheat, fruit and nuts. The Keksn valley to the north is about 4 miles long by 1 ^ wide. It is well water ed by the reed-fringed Kuksn River which flows from north-west to south-east and eventually joins the Kur. The valley is very fertile and grows wheat, barley. West South-wedt ..S2 maize, lentils, beans etc. There is no village by the name of Kcknn but in th« K*k«n area are a number of small settlements. In the centre of this valley is an open space which has been used as a landing— ground (80 X 300 yards) by small planes The valley is entirely surrounded by mountains with outlets through steep passes to south, north and north-west. 3, Climate (а) Wilder Quarters In the high north-eastern section the winter is mild and the summer warm and dry. In the west, south and south-west the winters are mild but the climate is very hot and dry in summer. Rainfall is adequate in winter and spring but water is scarce in the hot season. In the lower and better watered districts malaria is very prevalent, * (б) Summer Quarters x winter and early spring the northern area is under many feet of snow and i* bitterly cold. In summer it is cool and pleasant and practically free from malaria. 4. Agriculture (а) Winter Quarters Lack of irrigation works reduces agriculture to a small sea e in the winter quarters Water channels are reported to be under construction. Apparently the tribe intend to settle in parts of this area although it is far from fertile. Wheat, barley, beans maize, fruits and tobacco are grown. Crops sown in late December or January are’ rain-fed and harvested from April to June by settled villagers or by tribesmen who delay their move to the summer quarters. (б) Summer Quarters In this area the soil is more fertile and water plentiful. In the Ardekun valley and Komehr and Kukun districts there is extensive cultivation of cereals and many different kinds of fruits and nuts, -, COMMUNICATIONS 1. External (a) Winter Quarters The only motorable road is the A.I.O.C. road from Ganuveh on the Gulf Ooasf to Gach Snnm with branches to Mishnn and to within one mile of Barm-e Shur For a description of the animal track from Mishun to Rudak see Appendix III. (b) Summer Quarters Access to the Kashkuli summer quarters by motor transport is possible only by the Shiraz to Ardektra road, impassable in winter but of good surface in summer The continuation of this road as far as Tol-e Khosru and Komehr and Kskun was formerly motorable but is now only possible for pack transport. There is also a branch track to Dez-e Kord. 2. Internal (Migration). From the winter quarters the Kashkuli converge on the Shuhpur-Fehliun valley from which there are two main routes to the summer quarters : * * • (i \n^ (Gf), Naudsn (G4788), Bol Hayet (G5778), Dasht-e Arjen (G7574) Chehel Cheshmeh (G7978), Ruditm (B7718), Horn™™ (the plain south-east of Ardekun), to Komehr, Kt?kun etc. (B3318)Har8riz (B4212), Tir Taj (B5612), Haraijtm (B7815), Hommjtm to Komehr, Kuktm, etc. j89 ORGANIZATION. In the past the Ilkhvni for the Government appointed IcalanUm of the sub-tribes, not necessarily the sons of the preceding chiefs nor khans chosen by the majority of the tribe. The kalantars of the sub-tribe appointed the JcadJchodas of each sub-section. At present as Nuser Khan does not hold the title of Ilkhvni he treads carefully where the Kashkuli tribes are concerned. The khans of Kashkuli have profited by this caution on the part of N«ser Khan to achieve virtual independence although they profess obedience to him. Elius and Jehtmgir Khans have been made responsible for the security in the north-west and south-east of the winter quarters respectively but have not been officially appointed kalantars although the entire tribe looks on them as such. Some of the other khans maintain that the Kashkuli have no chief or chiefs but that all the khans govern ns a corporate body. The kalantars appoint the kadkhodas in that section of Kashkuli over which they have control. Taxation is carried out by sub-sections who pay their dues to the kalantar to whom they ove allegiance either because of their place of residence or because of traditional association. It appears that these sub-sections are free to transfer their allegiance from one khan to another and this limits the rapacity of the khans. The khans provide the salaries and arms for rifle-men, both foot and mounted, and ha ve the right to call on the services of these men when they please. Sub-sections that settle and take up agriculture are obliged to pay one fifth of the crop to the khan who owns the land. In all cases a percentage of the flocks is given to the protecting khan who, in theory, passes on a share to one of the kalanfare. In theory also the kahviars pass on a share of these taxes to Neser Khan but in fact they do not appear to do so. Possibly occasional presents are made instead. The only Government taxes paid are on produce entering town markets. ECONOMIC The khans of Kashkuli who twenty or thirty years ago were very wealthy became impoverished under Soulat ed Douleh’s and subsequently under Reza Shah’s harsh administration. Since 1941, wdien they regained their independence, they have resumed their former power and hope to reach positions of wealth and influence in Qashqai. As a means to this end many of the Kashkuli khans seem to have decided to try settlement and agriculture instead of robbery and plundering. They are also concentrating on sheep-breeding and sell the wool which is noted for its good quality. The 30,000 sheep that are marketed annually constitute the major part of the tribe's income. Other sales are from wheat, barley and fruit. Kashkuli rugs and carpets are famous but the sale of them forms a very minor part of the tribal economy. The principal market centres are Kuzerun and, Ganuveh in the winter quarters and Ardekun in the summer quarters, The A.I.O.C. in Gach Ssnm buys meat from the Kaehkuli khaus,14 The khan* of Kashkuli, who have developed their land, built villages and settled * portion of their following, seem to treat their people well, taxing lightly and distri buting a good proportion of the Government monoply goods due to the tribe. Condi tions in these parts are good for Qashqai. Among the nomadic sections condition, are fair ; the khans are rapacious in taxing the people and handling the tribal financ® and although the tribe is wealthy it is the khans only who profit.

The Kashkuli are on good, although not cordial, terms with Mamassani, with their Qashqai neighbours to the north and oast, and with the people of the settled districts of the summer quarters* In the winter quarters the Kashkuli have in the past ten years been trying to extend and strengthen their hold on the Khesht and Kemnrej districts and the Kvzerun 8 ection of the Bushire road. Jehungir Khan who controls security in the Khesht area has come into conflict with Heshmat ul Mamulek (Hassan Ali Hekmat , a resident of Shiraz) who owns the land and has difficulty in collecting his exorbitant taxes from the Khcshtis whom the Kashkuli treat well. The Boir Ahmadi are always an object of suspicion and dislike as they regularly spend the winter raiding into Qashqai (Kashkuli), Fersimadtm and Darrehshuri territory while the latter are in their winter quarters. THE PEOPLE The average Kashkuli tribesman is an industrious, quiet, hospitable, family man. From 1941 to 1943 he had his share in the robberies and .plundering of villager^ that marked that period but has since shown more desire to return to a settled and peaceful way of life than any other sub-tribe of Qashqai. In appearance the Kashkuli represents the true Qashqai type: he is above averagt height, spare, has a dark complexion and hair and the inevitable beak nose. Hi* dress is a mixture of Persian Army, European and tribal oddments. The Irmed men generally wear complete tribal dress consisting of the distinctive Qashqai hat, hshirt end trous-rs, cotton stockings, woven cotton shoes, a bulky cummerbund85 stuffed with cartridges and assorted weapons and over all a loose cotton or woollea robe. The Kashkuli way of life represents the highest standards of nomad Qashqai, The standard of living is high and morals, as elsewhere in Qashqai, are good. There appears to be more than the average respect for truth and straight-dealing. Poly gamy is rare. In general health is as good as anywhere else in Qashqai; malaria is slight except in some parts of the winter quarters. Trachoma affects about 5 per cent of the people and there is reported to be no venereal disease in the tribe. The Kashkuli are of Shi’ah persuasion and although professing to be devout show no signs of fanaticism. Very little attention is paid to education and only the sons of the khans have an opportunity of becoming literate. The khans of Kashkuli (see also Appendix I) are chiefly remarkable for their numbers and their co-operative spirit. They are more imposing in appearance than the average Qashqai khan and fill, better than most, the role of a feudal lord. They adhere strictly to the custom of marrying into their own or neighbouring ruling fami lies. Monogamy is the rule and they are noted for their model family life and, in some cases, their almost benevolent treatment of their people. STRENGTH Kashkuli total 3,310 families of whom possibly 2,000 families are nomadio. The remainder of the total are settled around Ardekun in the north and Mishsn etc., in the winter quarters. The tribe possesses about 500 good rifles and an uncertain number of oldet weapons. Ammunition is plentiful. It is estimated that there are between 3,500 and 4,000 fighting men in Kashkuli but it is doubtful if more than 1,000 could be assembled in one place at one time. Qashqai fighting men frequently depart from the field of battle during operations to tend their corps or flocks : this failing accounted for General Shuhbakhti’s ultimately successful advance on Firuzubud in 1943 when his opponents suddenly disappeared* ANALYSIS OF SUB-SECTIONS The following table provides details of sub-sections, the nulmber of families in each, the name of the kadkhoda at the time of the writing of the report, location of summer and winter quarters and the name of the khan to whom allegiance is owned. Figures are only approximate and Icadlhodas, locations and allegiances liable to sudden change. The map references of points not shown on existing maps have been estimated from directions given by tribesmen and should be treated as ap proximate.96 APPENDIX I— PERSONALITIES.

The latter is now building a house there and re-cultivating the orchards (oranges and lemons) which were destroyed in the time of Reza Shah. There is a small fertile tract to the North of the village (wheat and barley). There are two water mills, one now fallen into disuse. The water is bitter but as in the case of Chehvr Bisheh, fresh water can be found near by. The track now turns almost due south, and follows the river for about one mile, after which it turns off right into a wide plain. To the left of the track as the plain is entered can be seen the ruins of huts swhich were constructed during the time of Reza Shah w hen an attempt was made to eedentarize the tribes.

ORIGIN This sub-tribe of Qashqai, known as the Kashkuli Kuchek, is the remnant of the once powerful Kashkuli Kermuni (Jtmi Khan, first Ilkhani of Qashqai, had Kash kuli divided into three portions, Bozorg, Kermuni and Qaracheh—see KASHKULI BOZORG, ORIGIN). HISTORY As a result of the marriage of Soulat ed Douleh to the daughter of Huji Abdollah Khan, former kalantar of Kashkuli Kuchek, the latter sub-tribe enjoyed a favoured position until about 1922 when they totalled about 800 families. Huji Abdollah was succeeded by his son, Hamzeh Khan, who had little interest in tribal affairs and neg lected his people. Kashkuli consequently declined in importance and later in num bers and wealth. Hamzeh Khan was removed to Tehran in 1930. He returned to Shiraz in 1941 where he still lived in 1945 although his dealings with the Kashkuli Kuchek went no further than the management of his lands in Kvk^n. Reza Shah enforced partial settlement of the Kashkuli Kuchek in their summer quarters although they were allowed to send a number of shepherds with the tribal sheep and goats on the annual migration. Since 1941 the Kashkuli Kuchek have been quiet and have not taken part in any open opposition to the Government. TERRITORY In the north of Ears all three Qashqai sub-tribes of Kashkuli origin (Bozorg, Kuchek and Qaracheh) hold adjacent summer quarters. In the winter quarters all three are separated and the Kashkuli Kuchek camp more than 100 miles south east of their kinsmen, M87Army100 1. Boundaries Maps : H39\V, Jul ’41 : H39J, Jun’40 : H39K, Jul’41. (а) Winter Quarters The Arba’eh (“ four districts ”) area south of Firuzebud (UN48) Kashkuli KucKek territory is bounded it the north by Rudbur (UN 4577) to the west by the Rud Shur River, to the south by Dehram (UN 2039) and Hangum (UN 4135) and to the east by Khavis (UN 5158). These loundaries include the Zukheruyeh district (villages not marked on the existing maj). These winter quarters are a portion of the original Kashkuli Bozorg winter quarters (see KASJKULI—ORIGIN). (б) Summer Quarters The tribe is found in summer in the Kukun valley (HB 58). They are reduced to a bare 500 families and their summer location varies little from year to year. 2. Physical (а) Winter Quarters The valleys south and east of Firuzubud are described u der QASHQAI— AMALEH. (б) Summer Quarters The Kuknn valley is described under KASHKULI BOZORG. 3. Climate For Winter Quarters see AMALEH, for Summer Quarters KASHKULI BOZORG 4. Agriculture (а) Winter Quarters In the Arba’eh area the tribespeople cultivate a considerable area of land and grow crops of wheat and barley. (б) Summer Quarters The Kashkuli Kuchek go in for cultivation on a fair scale in the summer quarters* (Much of the farming in the Kuken area is done by Kashkuli Bozorg tribesmen). They produce crops of cereals and of fruit (apricots, apples, cherries etc.). COMMUNICATIONS 1. External (a) Winter Quarters The road from Shiraz to F iruznbud gives access to the northern border of the tribal area. South of Firuzubud the tracks are too rough for motor transport. There is a network of easy animal tracks. (b) Summer Quarters The track from Arduknn to K-ekun, which can be covered only on horseback, is described in detail in Route Report No. 2 of APPENDIX III toF yRSlMADyN. 2. Internal—Migration On the way from summer to winter quarters the tribe assembles near Beizw (UC 1412) and then moves through Kelestnn (UC 1601). Khun-e Zeninn, Khnn-e Khavis (UH 0761). Siakh and Firuznbnd to Hangnm and the Arba’eh district.101 ORGANIZATION The Kashkuli Kuchek have had no Jcalantar since 1941. Amir Bahadur, son o, Hassan Khan who is brother of Hamzeh, is the head man and he is much under t he control of Elms and Jehnngir Khans Kashkuli who administer the tribe through him on the same lines as one of their own sub-sections (see KASHKULI—ORGANIZA TION). Nnser Khan regards Kashkuli Kuchek as an independent sub-tribe and for that reason it is not included among the Kashkuli Bozorg sub-sections. It is not unlikely that a Jcalantar will be appointed to this sub-tribe in the future. ECONOMIC • General conditions in Kashkuli Kuchek are fair and on a standard simi ar to Kashkuli Bozorg. Most of the tribespeople derive their income from their herds and flocks. Few are settled and the crops from their land in the winter and summer quarters are used mainly for home consumption. The khans of Kashkuli take an exorbitant proportion of all produce as their due. RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURS (а) Winter Quarters North, south and east: Amaleh, Rahimi and Qara^cni. West : Sheshboluki. (б) Summer Quarters North : Fu'simadun. South : Kashkuli Bozorg. East : Amaleh, Qaracheh and Rah mi West : Boir Ahmadi Sar..ad :i. Relations with other tribes are mainly good. The Kashkuli Kuchek have a good reputation. They suffer from he depredations of other tribes (Boir Ahmadi but do not seem to indulge much in theR themselves. In inter-tribal pol cy .hey take their cue from the khans of Kashkuli Bozorg. THE PEOPLE In dress and rppearance he people are similar to the tribespeople of Kasbkuli Bozorg. STRENGTH K a .Ukuli Kuchek number about 560 families nearly all of whom are nomadic. They possess about 50 rifles.

Fifty years ago they were an important tribe but settlement and the weakening of the spirit of independence has much depleted their numbers ; many groups have become absorbed with the settled Persians in their summer and winter quarters. TERBITORY (Maps H39K, Jul ’41 ; H39X, Oct ’41). 1. Boundaries Both in the winter and summer quarters the Kordshuli mingle freely with their Qashqai and Btfseri neighbours so that it is difficult to fix any precise boundaries. (i) Summer Quarters North : Khonjesht (C 4588). South : Khoshkur or Kuftar (C 4776), , East : Kordshul (C 3585). West : Point (C 5975). («) Winter Quarters The Qir and Kt?rzin plain ; eastwards towards Sissun (UO 2637) and Afzar (approx. UO 2419). 2 . Physical (i) Summer Quarters The plain around Khonjesht runs in a north-west to south-easterly direction It is from six to 12 miles wide and is flanked by steep mountains. The Pohur stream flows along the base of the southern hills. Water is plentiful from sprines wells and the river and the soil is very fertile. (n) Winter Quarters The Qir, Kurzin and Afzar plains are described under Qashqai—Amaleh Terri tory. The Amaleh tribes and the Kordshuli are not divided from one another by •any boundary in this southern area. ^ 3. Climate (а) Summer Quarters See Qashqai—Sheshboluki. (б) Winter Quarters See Qashqai—Amaleh. 4. Agriculture In their summer quarters, where half of the tribe is settled, the Kordshuli mw wheat, barley and opium for export and home consumption. In a good year thev derive a large portion of their income from their sales. They do not go in for cultiva^ tion in the winter quarters to which about half of the tribe migrates with the floclJ and herds. ^ COMMUNICATIONS It is possible to reach the villages where the Kordshuli are settled in the summer quarters by the track from Dehbid to Qeshlcq-e Dehbid and thence to Khoniesht This is open in summer only and is very rough. The winter quarters may be regarded as inaccessible as there is no known track running south from the Fast? Juv road and giving access to Sissun etc. It is reported however that trucks have bee^ taken within a few miles of Qir across the flat desert south of Jahrom104 The line of migration of the nomadic section of Kordshuli is similar to that of B^seri, although frequently the tribe accompanies the Qashqai Amaleh on their route. The route of the Bcseri from north to south, lies by Sivand, Mervdasht, Band-e Amir, Kharaneh, Sarvestun, Khafr, Mansurebiid and thence to the Sisson district. ORGANIZATION The chief of Kordshuli, Attn Khan, holds a position of very doubtful indepen dence. He is obliged to bow to the wishes of N'eser Khan in all the affairs of his tribe yet nominally his people come under the administration of Lotfali Qa\ami, the Khamseh Governor. The latter at least assumes responsibility for their behaviour. Attn Khan exercises control over his tribe through his three sons. He does not appoint heads for the various sub-sections as is the normal practice but charges his sons with the maintenance of order and the settlement of all minor tribal matters. He probably receives his orders for migration from Nuser Khan and sends his eldest son, Jawed Attepur, on the migration with the nomadic section of the tribe. ECONOMIC Thanks to successful settlement the khans of Kordshuli are wealthy. They make their profits principally from the sale of wheat and opium and the marketing of their sheep in ybedeh and Yezd (they are unique among the tribes of Ears in their use of the latter market). The Yezd bazaar fetches higher prices than that of Shiraz. It is believed that the Kordshuli indulge in the profitable practice of smuggling their wheat to Yezd, a deficit area, where it sells at 60 rials a maund which is three times the Shiraz black market price. The khans exact the usual “ taxes ,r from their people ; these approximate one fifth of all crops and herds. It seems that the khans do not treat their people extor- tionately and conditions are roughly on the level of the Qashqai which is in turn superior to that of Khamseh. RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURS (t) Summer Quarters North and West: Sheshboluki Qashqai. East : Btfseri Khamseh. South : Settled villagers of the Rvmjerd district. North and east : Buseri Khamseh. (ti) Winter Quarters West and south : Amaleh Qashqai. As mentioned under HISTORY Kordshuli relations with neighbouring tribes are exceptionally good. They spare no effort to maintain good relations with both Qashqai and Khamseh neighbours. As a result the name of their tribe is rarely heard in connexion with robberies or inter-tribal scrapping and disputes are amicably settled by Atta Khan. It can be taken for granted that between Qashqai and Khamseh in a dispute the Kordshuli would side with the party that stood the best chance of gaining its point. They recognise Qashqai as the most powerful tribe in Ears and are prepared to be counted with the Qashqai but they take every precaution to keep on the best terms with Khamseh. It says much for the success of their pacific policy that both Buseri and Sheshboluki move across their lands in the north and Amaleh in the south with out any apparent friction. THE PEOPLE The average Kordshuli tribesman is thick-set and of medium height with a very dark complexion and hair. They wear for the most part a mixture of tribal and European clothes. Their way of life resembles that of Qashqai rather than Khamseh105 STRENGTH Estimated total of the Kordshuli tribe is 400 families of whom 200 are totally settled and the rest migrate with their flocks annually. The Kordshuli possess no more than 50 rifles, these are used for maintaining security in the settled areas. ANALYSIS OF SUB-TRIBES Kordshuli is divided into the four sub-tribes given below. They possess no chiefs but are governed directly by Attu Khan in the summer quarters and by his son while on the migration. 1. Khalaj 30 families. 'I 2.

To them have been added a number of other tribes, large and small, that have been placed or have voluntarily come under the jurisdiction of the Gover nor of the Khamseh. The later additions are tribes that were formerly independent or attached to other main groups such as Qashqai but finding difficulty in managing their affairs or being unable to maintain their positions in the face powerful neigh bours have attached themselves to or been gradually incoiporated in the Khamseh administration. The “ five tribes ” number roughly 60,0^0 souls and the tribes attached to them an additional 10,000. The Governor of Khamseh therefore controls about 70,000 tribesmen. HISTORY ?5 years ago the Khamseh group were Qavam ul Mulk’s “ people *\ But even at that time he took little active part, in the administration of their affairs and was reckoned to have little real authority over them. Since then Qavam and the Khamseh have drifted still further apart and only after the entry of the allies into Persia did they show signs of coming together again. During Reza Shah’s reign the Khamseh were administered by a series of Military G« vernors and there is little doubt that 1 ad Pahlevi not fallen all connexion between the Qavam family’ and Khamseh would have been finally severed. In 1922 Qavam lest the right to take taxes from the tribes and he has not since re-asserted it. Treatment of the various tribes of the Khamseh varied during the reign of Reza Shah. The Buseri, Ain-clu and Nafar were to seme extent left to themselves on con dition that migration ceased. Sections of the B'asc-ri improverished themselves by paying bribes to Government officials so as to ccntinue their migration and other sec tions settled into comparative prosperity. The three small settled tribes, Ainvlu, Baht rlu and Nafar, suffered only a few of the oppressions of corrupt officialdom. The Arab tribe who have an antipathy to settlement were forced to abandon the migration, lapsed into a state of self-martyrdom and made no effort to get the best out of the land they farmed which was some of the finest in Pars. Their continued indulgence in lawlessness brought them into conflict with the Military Governor and they suffered arbitrary punishment at the hands of the Army. They did not however at any time suffer any oppression comparable to that meted out to Qashqai. The reason for this was that the Khamseh never presented a threat to Government authority or to the security of the province nor bad they the political importance of the Qashqai. The Army therefore did not consider it necessary to kick them while they held them down. The total strength of Kbamseh decreased from about 17,000 families in 1918 to 14,000 in 1945. The settled tribes who number roughly two fifths of the Khamseh total although not prosperous have largely lost their love of tribal independence and it is almost true to say that tfigy are part of Khamseh in name only since their atti tude to tribal affairs is that &lt;jf settled peasants in a tribal area. Reza Shah carried out an almost complete disarmament of Kbamseh who re mained disarmed until 1941. The inclination to fight was never as strong in Khamseh as in Qashqai and Khamseh are not commonly described as a warlike tribal M«7Armjm group. Thus the disarmament did not have the effect of partially taming a warrior band but it forced the tribesmen to resort to sticks and stones when engaged in rob beries and hold-ups for which they have not lost their taste. The khans of the Khamseh tribes with few exceptions were not detained or arres ted during Reza Shah’s time. They remained in control of their sub-tribes at the loss of much of their authority and of the privileges of their position. But in most cases they were sensible enough to obey the instructions of the Military Governor and so kept out of trouble. Although they and their people chafed under the irregulari ties of Government control they did not become hostile to the Government or har bour the resentment, hostility and hate of officialdom that smouldered in Qashqai for twenty years. In 1941 therefore when the sudden collapse of Government control allowed them to return to their former ways their first thought was not of preparation for battle with all outside authority. They saw the tribes around them rearming and decided to rearm themselves. This they did chiefly by unearthing old weapons, buying in the open market and, to a lesser extent, by smuggling, buying from Army deserters and theft from the disorganized troops. They thus acquired about 1,500 good modem rifles with which number it is believed they have remained content. With the relaxing of Government authority the khans of the sub-tribes of the main Khamseh tribes regained their old positions which are those of petty feudal chiefs. Kalantar-sbiy once more became a profitable business and each khan had his band of armed followers. With the exception of a very few sub-tribes the Arab and Buseri resumed the annual migration. As in 1918 the Khamseh were leader less ; the only leader they could recognize, since there was no Ilkh^ni, was Qavam ul Mulk and him they professed to accept. The Khamseh did not unite either in opposition to the Government or as a de fensive measure towards other hostile tribes but all the tribes declared their readiness to oppose any expansion or aggression by the Qashqai and their associates. The five tribes returned independently to their former way of life and the Arabs and Buseri in particular reverted to lawlessness. In 1942 and 1943 hold-ups on roads in the Khamseh area, inter-tribal raids and robberies, general insecurity and banditry were rife. As it was only a minor anxiety to the Army and Gendarmerie who were more occupied with the open hostility and armed superiority of Qashqai this state of affairs continued unchecked. The Military Governors appointed to Khamseh, Amir Sadri and Razmju, made use of their authority to amass considerable fortunes, appointed and dismissed a number of minor unscrupulous khans and, as far as they dared, let the five tribes go their own way. In 1944, with the easing of the Qashqai situation, Government control cn the roads of Fars was tightened up and hold-ups and robberies much reduced. Internal strife in Khamseh was unchecked and villa gers throughout the Khamseh area suffered their depredations and pillagings without much hope of Government intervention. 1944 saw the appointment of a Civil Gov ernor to replace the Military Governor of Khamseh. Suhebdivuni, a close relative o r Qavam, was chosen. His incompetence did nothing to improve conditions in Khamseh ana lawlessness and internal troubles continued on a little reduced scale. . Lotfali Qavami, Amir Arfa, a nephew of Qavam, was appointed as Sup ervisor {sarparast) of Khamseh. Suhebdivuni lost his appointment at Amir Arfa’s insistence and became Amir Arfa’s unofficial assistant. It is very unlikely that the Governor-General would have appointed any man to this post w r ho was not approved of by Qavam ul Mulk and he was fortunate in his choice of Amir Arfa. Under his 1ml smirit 6 a&lt; ^ m * D ^' ra ^ on Khamseh progressed noticeably towards prosperity10 $ Since 1941 no taxes have been collected from Khamseh and this is said to be be* cause of the benevolence of Qavam ul Mulk. It is not clear however how taxes could be collected from the tribespeople if it were even desired since the Government is un able to collect them from the settled population of the province. The new Governor secures a fair proportion of monopoly goods for the tribespeople and keeps a check on the behaviour of the khans. For further details on history and the present situation see the detailed analysis of the main sub-tribes. GEOGRAPHY Maps : H39E, Jul ’40 H39F, Jul ’41 H39K, Jul ’41 H39L&gt; Jun ’40 1. Position The summer and winter quarters of the migratory tribes of Khamseh together 'with the districts inhabited by the settled tribes and the tribes attached to Khamseh are spread out over all Fars east of the eastern boundary of Qashqai country. In summer the Dehbid, Bavunet and Qonquri districts on the eastern side of the Shiraz- Isfahan road, the valleys west of Qcderebcd and Sivand and the eastern section of the Mervdaeht of plain are occupied by Khamseh. In winter Arabs and Beseri settle in the Fase Governorate, and the Jahrom, Juyom and Baneruyeh districts and spread to points fifty miles east and west of these centres. Settled tribes of Khamseh are found in the south as far east as Furg, Dcreb and Yezd-e Kbust-e Dcrub. Others inhabit the hills and valleys that stretch eastwards and north^irds from the Mervdasht plain through ybedeh Tashk, Niriz and Estahbenet towards the desert lying west of the Yezd-Sirjen track. 2.

H39R, Jul Ml H39X, Oct Ml H40M, Jul M2 H40S, Mar M23. Physical The large area occupied by the ivbamseh tribes is described district by district under the various tribal headings. In general it consists of (i) the high plateau and valleys around Dehbid in the north and the Meivdasht plain (u) the sparsely popu- lated valleys in the yb-adeh Tashk and Niriz regions in the north-cast and {Hi) the hot, dry plains and low valleys of the Fasa, Jahrora, Juyom, Durub, Furg and L«r districts in the south and south-east. Area {i) comprises the 6,000 ft. Dehbid plateau with the valleys to west and east which run in a general north-west to south-east direction. These are separated by high and sometimes precipitous ranges of mountains and are connected frcm north to south by the Isfahan-Shiraz road and a number of difficult elevated passes passable only for animal transport. These valleys include those of Ahmadubud, Kordshul and Qesh)uq-e Dehbid to the west of the main road and those of Bavunut, Bugh-e Sich, Khafrak and Arsenjuri to the east. The Mervdasht plain, watered by the Kur Biver and its tributary for the north, the Polvur, runs eastwards between ridges of steep hills from Rumjerd to the Tashk salt lake. It varies from 10 to 16 miles in width and js dead flat. Area (n) is made up of the settled ybudeh Tashk, Niriz and Estahbunut districts through which a few sections of the - Khamseh pass on migration (and where some emaller sections are settled) and the barren mountains to the north and north-east which are watered in winter by a few springs and streams and become a wilderness in Summer. In general the valleys run south-east becoming more barren as they slope down to the Sirjun depression. In the narrow plains to the immediate north-east of ybadeh Tashk there is more 'water and the Basham and Chehurr. hi tribes, attached to Khamseh, graze their flocks here throughout the year. Area (rn^jn which all the five tribes spend the winter is only very roughly map' ped and partly unexp ored. In the north-west a number of deep, high-walled val leys run south-eastwards from Shiraz towards Fasu, the centre of the area. In the north a high range of mountains forms the boundary with a narrow' pass giving access to Niriz, Estahbunut and the wilderness beyond. This range extends eastwards into the unmapped mountain mass north-east of Dtirtb. Immediately south of this range, in the west, is the Fasti-Jahrom plain and in the east is the Dumb valley. The Wasu and Dumb plains are connected by a series of narrow passes and valleys. T1 e Fasu—Jahrom plain is a great stretch of undulating country broken by a few lew ridges and hills and watered by wells and water-channels from the springs in the surrounding hills. It is a very fertile area. The Dumb district is no less fertile and is aflat valley hemmed in by very high mountains. It is watered by streams and Irrigation channels which have their sources in the mountains. South and south-east of these three fertile areas, Fasu, Jahrom and Dumb, is a more barren region. It consists of two great flat plains, one, in the north-east, about 800 feet above the level of the other, in the south-west. They are divided by a ridge of mountains running from Jahrom south-east just north of Juyom to the moun tain mass north of Lur. Both plains become parched in summer and away' fro m the few wells the land becomes a desert. After the winter rains grass and small plants spring up and provide grazing for tribal sheep and goats. The plains are bounded to the south by the parallel ridges and valleys of the mountains around Lur and to tie east by the barren mountain mass around Furg. 4. Climate and . Agriculture Throughout the northern part cf the Khamseh territory a severe winter confines agricultural pursuits to warmer seasons. In the valleys around Dehbid it is im-possible to keep livestock in the open after November and there is in general no winter crop of cereals north of Sivand. The Khafrak and Arsenjun valleys and th' Mervdasht plain in the centre lie lower and have a milder winter. Although scarcely any members of the Khamseh tribes spend the winter here, there is a considerable settled population which reaps a winter crop of cereals and vegetables. Even these mild vallevs, the Arab and Essen claim, are too cold for the flocks in winter. In winter therefore the Khamseh nomads are to be found in the southern sec tion of their territory where they graze their flocks, produce crops of cereals, beans and peas, opium etc. These crops grow mostly on lands owned by the khans hut farmed by the native Persians and not by the tribesmen. The latter keep almost exclusively to their livestock. In summer this southern area is one of the warmest parts of the province. The surface water very soon dries out. The old irrigation systems still visible in the south and east have been abandoned and little effort is now made to bring this very fertile soil under cultivation. Except near the few wells where villages cluster the plains are nearly deserted in summer. Around Fasu, Jahrom and Dumb landlords from Shiraz have bought up the fertile tracts and the heavy crops of rice, wheat, barley, oranges and dates which are produced there in summer are not a factor in Khamseh economy. In summer the nomadic sections of Khamseh take their flocks to the cool, 6,000 ft. valleys in the north. The climate there is mild and the nights cold throughout the summer. Here again a casual participation in agriculture makes a relatively small addition to the Khamseh income. A more industrious people could doubt less make much more of the well-watered Mervdasht and Khafrak valleys where probably less than one quarter of the suitable land is under wheat, barley, vegetable and fruit cultivation. The settled sections of Khamseh have not yet rid themselves of their aver sion to agriculture. Wherever they are found conditions are poor and crops indifferent. In the Remjerd valley (Mervdasht) part of the Nafar have settled. The climate, soil and abundant water supply enable the local Persian peasants to reap good crops of rice and cereals throughout the year but the greatest squalor and poverty is found in the villages occupied by Nafar tribesmen. These conditions are paralleled in the southern area, around Fasu and Dumb and south of Lur where res pectively the Ainulu, Bahurlu and part of Nafar are settled. The advantages of the climate and ogrieultural resources of these regions have already been mentioned v et the Kbamseh tribespeople in almost every case appear to make the least profit of the conditions in the district in which they live. COMMUNICATIONS 1. Ex’tERNAL (Under the various tribal headings details of many of the routes below are given). (a) Summer Quarters The Isfahan-Sbiraz road runs through the centre of the nomad Khamseh summer quarters and representative sections of the tribes can usually be fotmd in Dehbid, Sa’udetubud and Mervdasht. In summer access to the remoter parts of Khamseh territory is possible by the six routes outlined below : (i) Surmaq to Eqlid : the latter a Qashqai and Arab trading centre; surface fair but passable in summer only.112 (u) Dehbid to Q^shluq-e Dehbid, Khonjesht, Ahmadibvd and ysoJ)t?s with A branch to Sirb-tmu : B^seii summer quarters ; very difficult going ; from Khonjesht onwards impassable for all but the stoutest cars' (in) Takht*e Jamshid to Rumjerd (part of the settled Nafar tribe): surface good^but summer only ; intersecting streams impassable after winter rains ; from Rsmjerd an animal track gives access to the Beseri district over the Emunm’deh Esmuil pass. (iv) Dehbid to Bavanufc village and Mazijun (UD55): summer only, surface rough. (v) Q^derubtii to Bugh-e Sffih and Cheh'erreh (the latter the centre of the Chehtjrrehi tribe) ; surface rough throughout the year ; passable in summer and, with great difficulty, in winter. (vi) Sa’tjdetebud to Arsenjtm : surface bad but passable in summer. (b) Winter Quarters Apart from the main motor roads running from Shiraz to Fasu, Dursb and L«r {via Jahrom) and the alternative route to Jahrom via Khafr and Qotbsbsd there are practically no recognized means of access to the Khamseh winter quarters. Throughout the area however there are numerous camel tracks which in many cases can be followed by a stout car in summer. The main roads are very rough in summer and much more so in winter. A brief description follows. (t) Shiraz to Fast?: surface in summer very rough, in winter soft and very diffi cult for private cars. ^Very rarely impassable for a lorry or a vehicle with twin- axle drive. (u) Fast? to Dt?n?b : surface very rough in places in summer ; a number of torrent beds stop communication for several days at a time in winter : after heavy rain very soft and difficult for private cars. (Hi) Fase to Jahrom: surface very rough in summer and muddy in winter; streams across road ; very difficult after heavy rain. {iv) Jahrom to Juyom : surface good in summer and winter ; the road climbs over a 40-mile long pass the last five miles of which are very steep and rough : satis factory in summer and winter. (v) Juyom to Dehkuh (UU 29): the track is quite undefined and passes over a flat plain ; surface exceedingly rough in summer and a quagmire in winter ; prac tically impassable for a truck with twin-axle drive in March : all communication impossible after heavy rain. (vi) Dehkuh to Lur : track passes over a flat plain, then a very steep pass and finally down 15 miles of river bed into Lot ; impassable after heavy rain and exceedingly difficult throughout the winter ; very rough in summer. (vii) Pol-e Fast? (5 miles east of Shiraz) via Khafr to QotbebBd (U047): surface satisfactory in summer, difficult in winter: the quickest route from Shiraz to Jahrom and Lot. (viii) Dereb to Juyom: surface excellent in summer except for three short rough stretches: track not defined and a guide necessary : impassable owing to mud in winter. (c) Settled Tribes Access to the various settled tribes is possible by the roads mentioned below wider tribal headings.m (t) Airmlu : a track leads off the main Fas«-Dtjn?b road to the Shesh Deh dist rict, 10 miles to the north. Other branch tracks link up with the main villages of the district. (it) Baharlu ; routes no (it) and (viu) under (6) Winter Quarters give access to the Bah^rlu tribal area. (in) Nafar : a stout car can be taken far enough down the abandoned L«r- Lengeh track to make contact with the tribe about 15 miles south of L^r. The section of Nafar settled near Rumjerd can be reached by the Persepolis-Rtmjerd track (see Summer Quarters, route (Hi) ). (iv) Lashani, Cheh'crr.hi etc. (settled tribes in the north-east attached ta Khamsek); a rough road, motorable throughout the year, leads off the Shiraz-Fass road to Niriz and Estahbtmat. A very rough and difficult track runs from Niriz to ybvdeh Tashk on the north shore of the Tashk salt lake in the centre of the Lashani area. Another very rough track leads off to Qatru. 2. Internal The migration of the nomadic Khamseh tribes is confined to two main routes and the tribes keep to these although the amount of traffic varies from year to year. These routes are as below : (i) Assembling at Fast?: themce to Sarvestim or Runiz-e B^Iu, Kharemeh (Korb'el) and Band-e Amir ; dispersal to various areas via R'emjerd in the west r Sivand (on the main Shiraz-Isfahan road) in the centre and Arsenjen in the east. (ii) Assembling in the Juyom district; thence to Qotbubad, Khun-e Kvhden (UOl4:97) and Khafr, Sarvestun Kharemeh and Band-e Amir ; thence dispersal aa above. Note.— In general the tribespeople camping in the north, north-west and east of the winter quarters use route (») above while those of the south, south-east and south-west use route (n) r The latter route is generally the less used of the two. ORGANIZATION 1. The Position op the Governor (Supervisor) The Khamseh tribes and the tribes attached to Khamseh are controlled by a civil Governor appointed by the Governor-General with the title of Sarparast. Lotfali QaVami, Amir Arfa’s, conception of the position of the Sarparast is quite clear : he accepted the appointment on conditions which the Governorate accepted. The status of the Sarparast might change a great deal with the appoint ment of another Governor-General. The position and authority of Amir Arfa is that of IlMivni of Khamseh. As far as possible he exercises his authority through the khans and their armed follow ing and avoids making use of the Army and Gendarmerie. The Army provides him with an armed bodyguard of about 20 men and transport for use when he is in tribal territory. His reluctance to employ these two Government forces is reasonable r he regards himself as incorruptible and believes that the fewer corruptible agents at work in the tribes the better. He offers the Khans and their subordinates the alter natives or obedience or instant dismissal. He realises that he cannot treat Army and Gendarmerie subordinates with the same peremptory justice that he offers the khans. He has informed the commanders of the Fars division and of the Fare Gendarmerie as well as the Governor-General that he will stay in his post only if he has full control of both military and gendarmes in the area so that he can prevent them from interfering in tribal administration. ■ The largest tribe in Khamseh—the Arab, has no supreme head. The Bsseri are controlled by one kalantar. The three smaller settled tribes are each loosely unitedunder one IcaUtntar (in the case of Nafar th &gt; appointment is frequently vacant). The attached tribes are split up and are under the authority of the head man {kadkhoda) of their tribe or village. Amir Arfa therefore administers Khamseh through the Jcalantars of the sub-tribes in the case of Arab and the chiefs of the other smaller tribes. Over these leaders he exerts complete control. Under the separate tribal headings the organization of each part of the Khamseh tribal group is described in detail. Amir Arfa, as Governor of Khamseh, holds a position of exceptional indepen dence. He owes his appointment to the Governor-General but well knows that nothing must occur in Khamseh to prejudice its shadowy connexion with Qavam ul Mulk. Consequently Amir Arfa owes two allegiances : an official one to the Governor-General and a family one to Qavam ul Mulk. In the interests of his own career Amir Arfa would no doubt resign from the Khamseh if a Governor-General unwilling to tolerate the pretensions of Qavam in Khamseh were appointed to Ears and he thus found himself in a conflict of loyalties. 2. Financial For the post of Sarparast Amir Arfa receives about 12,000 rials monthly and in addition is paid about 15,000 rials as Governor of Fast?. All extra expenditure he incurs as Sarparast of Khamseh is met by Qavam ul Mulk. So far as is known he is neither offered nor does he accept presents of money or goods. There is a deeper penetration of Persian administration into the Khamseh area than into Qashqai territory in that Gendarmerie posts are established all along the roads in the south that intersect the Khamseh winter quarters while in the north there are posts in the remote villages of Baventt, Chehvrrvh, Kharemeh and ybedeh Tashk. ECONOMIC 1 . Economic Conditions Some sections of Khamseh touch the lowest level of squalor, disease and poverty to be found in Fars. The bulk of the Khamseh, the nomadic tribes, are by tribal standards very poor and compared with Qashqai give a very unfavourable im pression of the life led by a nomad people. The reasons for these poor living conditions are to be found principally in the nature of the Khamseh tribesman *. he makes singularly little effort to better him self. This characteristic is found to a greater or lesser extent among all the tribes of Khamseh. Another reason lies in the fact that the land in the Khamseh summer quarters is poor when compared with that to the west and north-west where the Qashqai camp. This disadvantage is partly discounted by the existence in the Khamseh winter quarters and southern part of the summer quarters, the Mervdasht plain, of very fertile and wellwatered tracts of land. The Khamseh tribesmen show no inclination to farm these regions unless all arrangements are made and expenses defrayed for them. They apparently prefer their flocks and an impoverished exis tence. The effects of poverty on their way of life, appearance, habits and character are mentioned under PEOPLE. 2. Revenue The value of Khamseh income can no longer be judged from the part appro priated by Qavam ul Mulk as the latter no longer collects any tribute from them.Amir Arfa has done his best to restrain rapacious khans and to encourage agricul ture and economic cooperation between the tribes and although no taxes have been collected but all the income spent, ostensibly, on the betterment of the lot of the people, there has been little improvement in conditions in Khamseh. If this is to be taken as an indication of the exiguity of the income of the tribe and not of the enormity of the Khans rapacity the Khamseh are indeed distressed. The principal sources of income are the flocks and herds. The nomadic section rely almost entirely on the wool, meat, fats, etc., which they obtain to barter for household goods, clothes and other necessities from the villagers. They make many woollen goods for home consumption and their rugs which are of good quality and design find their way into the bazaars. Their crops of cereals in the winter quarters are used largely within the tribes and little is marketed. This applies equally to their fruit and vegetable produce except that tribes living near large towns will market much of their produce in the nearest bazaar. Camels, horses, mules and asses are a mainstay of the Khamseh income. These are hired out in the summer quarters for the transport of the sugar-beet crop to the Mervdasht sugar factory and both in the summer and in the winter quarters for grain transport. They also carry tribal produce to more distant markets such as Shiraz. Horses, apart from draught animals, are scarce. The khans of Khamseh rarely possess large and productive landed properties. But where, both in the summer and winter quarters, the post of lealantar has remained in one family for several generations and an estate has been acquired villages have grown up around it. In general, however, the post of Jcalantar is a temporary appointment and the khans tend to fill their purses rather than to build or acquire gardens or estates. 3. Taxation The people of Khamseh pay no direct Government tax. The khans evade pay ment of taxes on their properties. The only dues paid therefore are those on goods sold in the town markets. The khans make the usual deductions on all sales and purchases and it is estimated that the average khan collects about 1,000 tomans in a month in this way. This however is peculation rather than taxation. RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURING TRIBES The only important tribal neighbour of Khamseh is Qashqai. The two sec tions of Khamseh that have Qashqai sub-tribes as their neighbours in both summer and winter quarters are the Arab and Brseri. Their respective attitudes towards Qashqai are mentioned elsewhere. In general there exists in Khamseh a jealousy of rather than a long-standii g hatred for the Qashqai. The fact that the latter by three years of plundering and looting and epen opposition to the Government have considerably bettered their lot is a source of much annoyance to the docile Khamseh. The Qashqai point to the Khamsch ncmads as an example of the evil results of sub mission to the Government. The Khamsch for their part long for the day when they will be able to point to the Qashqai as an example of the evil consequences of opposition to the Goveirment; ncthirg would please them more than the forcible disarmament and taming of the Qashqai. Day to day relations with Qashqai are disturbed by raids and stealing. Result-' ing quarrels are in principle settled by the Governor and N-aser Khan by repayment in kind of all stolen goods. In practice the Qashqai are said to be many thousand sheep and goats to the good. MSTArmy116 Relations with the settled population of their area are simple : no tribe in Fars has a reputation for robbery and lawlessness equal to that of the Arabs : the Buseri are not far behind and the settled tribes, it is believed, only escape the stigma be cause they are few in number and their depredations are in consequence insignifi cant. The unfortunate villagers of the Khamseh territory have suffered much from these depredations and justly blame the Government as much as the tribes for their continuance. RELATIONS WITH THE PERSIAN GOVERNMENT After«their experience, of Reza Shah’s officials the Khamseh tribes naturally have no great faith in the Government. They have cooperated freely with Amir Arfa hoping that he will help them towards prosperity. Why they should work with this Governor and not with Suhebdivuni or the earlier succession of Military Governors is cleah. Amir Arfa’s predecessors did not disguise the fact that they had pockets to fill. With a strict and honest Governor and the exclusion of the corrupt Gendarmerie and Army the Khamseh say that they can progress a long way towards abandoning their lawlessness, settling and becoming industrious farmers but they maintain that settlement is impossible if the Government troops continue to oppress the peasants. Relations between the Khamseh and the Government depend largely on the person of the Governor-General of Ears. Not every Ostandor may be subservient to Qavam ul Mulk. It is even less likely that future officers commanding the Army and Gendarmerio will accept the exclusiveness of the Governor of Khamseh in matters of tribal administration when they have a perfect right under the existing system to interfere. The future administration of Khamseh is therefore uncertain. Amir Arfa is in favour of permanent settlement of all the Khamseh but lacks the necessary funds. He considers that he could disarm the Khamseh without dis turbance. If the Army attempted to settle the Khamseh by force or disarm them there would probably be skirmishes but no organized armed resistance. It would take much provocation to bring the Khamseh to fight Government troops. Whether the Government intends to disarm Khamseh or not the Khamseh khans tend to feel that the Government neglects Khamseh and favours Qashqai because the Khamseh can be relied on to keep quiet. Qashqai are a bigger problem for the Government but the Khamseh resent the fact that their own affairs languish while smaller Qashqai problems are quickly dealt with. THE PEOPLE There are several different racial types in Khamseh and many differences in physique, appearance and manner of life so that any generalization is virtually im possible. Reference to particular types and customs is to be found under the separate tribal headings. STRENGTH The total numerical strength of Khamseh, including the attached tribes is about 70,000 souls. There can be no more than 2,000 good rifles in all Khamseh but several thousand old weapons. The number of the latter in any tribe is always conjectural but in general a proportion of three to one exists between the old and the new weapons.The fighting qualities of the Khamseh tribesman are given under the different tribal headings.

APPENDIX I—PERSONALITIES. Atlirzv Ebrvhim Khan, Qavam ul Mulfc V .—Born 1888. Placed in charge of the Khamseh tribes 1911-12 by his father, Qavam ul Mulk IY. In 1911 drove combined forces of Nez'em es Saltaneli and Soulat cd Douleh out of Shiraz. 1916 succeeded to the title of Qavam ul Mulk on death of his father following a fall from his horse. Received assistance from the South Persian Rifles in 1917 in suppression of Bahurlu and other troublesome tribesmen. 1922-23 his influence in Khamseh declined sharply with the withdrawal of the South Persian Rifles and owing to opposition from the Army. Resident in Tehran 1923. Had himself elected representative to the Majles for Khamseh in 1923 to counteract the influence of feoulat ed Douleh and to gain immunity from his enemies. Part of his lands in Fars were appropriated by Pahlevi and lands in the north given in exchange. Until 1941 resident almost continually in Tehran. Influence in Fars and particularly control over Khamsch practically disappeared. After the Semirom incident in July 1943 appointed Governor-General of Fars. Remained six weeks in Fars and then returned to Tehran forced by opposition from Jehunbuni, G.O.C. troops in the south, lack of support from Tehran and by his own ineffectiveness to give up a difficult task. Conceived the idea in 1944 that it was his mission to save the south from Russian encroachment. Accordingly signed a pact at Kuh Ruyeh with Nuser Qashqai and Morteza Qoli Sams dm Bakhtim by which signatories bound them selves to resist Russian penetration in the south, to work in unity for the common good and not to run counter to British interests. In pursuance of this decision set up residence in Shiraz and started reestablishing himself among the Khamseh. He got involved in an undignified newspaper campaign with the Russian supported Tudeh press. Quarrelled with the Governor-General (General Firuz) whom with the asistance of Nuser Qashqai and various local deputies he eventually unseated-118 The ramifications of the Qayam family in Fars arc very considerable. At the end of 1945 the posts of head of the provincial Police, supervisor of the Khamseh and Governors of Fasu, Durub, Niriz and Lct were in the hands of the family. In addition Qavam had several deputies at his command and had attempted to extend his influence with and to the Mamassani, Doshmanziuri and Boir Ahmadi. He had contacts with some of the less loyal khans of Qashqai which he could use to . throw in his weight against Nesdr Qashqai in an extremity. Qavam ul Hulk is short, well-preserved and unimposing. He has a habit of dropping his eyes which makes him appear diffident. Shrewd : very obstinate in his convictions. During his short term of office as Governor-General in Shiraz lie showed himself to be irresolute and even hysterical in the face of difficulty. Repu tedly immensely wealthy but the exact extent of his fortune is unknown. Mean except where his own interests are concerned : generous to his family. A father to all members of the family whose obedience but not consciences he commands. The general tendency among them seems to bo to regard him with the utmost respect as the survival of a day that has gone. He himself does not seem to bo conscious of, or will not admit, this passage of time. Has two sons. Ali Mohammad (born 1912) and Mohammad Rczu (born 1915), both of whom were educated in England. The former married and subsequently divorced Princess Asliraf Paldevi, daughter of Reza Shah, by whom he had one child, a daughter. Qavam is extremely pro-British and a very loyal friend. Has a quiet charm. Is an excellent shot. Interested in horticulture. Lotfali Khan A?nir Arfa. —Born 1905. Second son of late Mohammad Taqi Khan, Moayyed ul Mulk II of the Qavami family. Educated at the American College, Beirut. Returned to Shiraz October 1923. Entered Government service. Served as Bakhshdar of Jahrom until 1941, then became Farmandar of Ease. Re taining this post was given the additional appointment of Sarparast of Khamseh in late 1944. Ambitious. Hopes to be appointed Governor of Yezd and then to enter the Ministry of Agriculture. Ultimate ambition is to become Minister of Agriculture after experience as Governor-General somewhere. Married to sister of Qavam ul Mulk, has one son (born about 1933) and a daughter (born about 1939). Dutiful to Qavam although privately considers him a back number. Lotfali Qavami is undoubtedly very pro-British and is believed to be almost entirely honest. In Jahrom and later in Fasti and Estahbtui'et he built public hos pitals and laid out gardens, broad avenues, public buildings and facilities. His taste is unformed and Pahlevi pretentiousness and disregard of existing beauties is the only model he knows of but his intentions are good. His ordering of the Khamseh tribes has resulted in a considerable improvement in conditions among them. His justice and incorruptible administration has vastly reduced lawlessness in the Arab tribe and has much improved security in the whole Khamseh area. Consequently enjoys a high reputation in Fars. Lotfali Qavami is of medium height and slight build and for a Persian of good family very^ dark. Always wears horn-rimmed spectacles. Can express himself adequately in English. Reserved at first acquaintance. Is extremely friendly and helpful and most hospitable. Well-informed and shrewd and deals firmly with his fellow-countrymen when necessary. Despite his qualities does not appear to be big enough a man to realise all his ambitions.no ARAB. ORIGIN The Arab is the biggest and most important tribe of the Khamseh group. Of Arab origin, hence the name, the tribesmen are still bilingual speaking a corrupt Arabic among themselves. At different stages in their histoiy they have been joined by sections of Turki and Lori speaking tribes but these still form distinct groups and although they migrate with and live in the same area as the Arab they are not to be reckoned as part of the Arab tribe proper. HISTORY During the reign of Reza Shah the Arab, like every other tribe in Fars, was dealt with harshly. The authority of Qavam ul Mulk V over the tribe was never strong but taxes wore always levied by his family before 1922. Conditions were far from prosperous in the first years after the 1914-18 war as the Arabs plead in excuse of their reputation, long-established before the war began, of their being the worst robbers and miscreants in Fars. Under Reza Shah almost all rifles were collected from the Arabs. The tribal chiefs were not arrested but the last of the Qavam family’s authority was removed with the appointment of the Khamseh Military Governor. Settlement was enforced in the summer and winter quarters, in the Mcrvdasht and Jahrom areas respectively. The Arabs are almost wholly devoted to sheep raising and even that section whose settlement was enforced in the richest part of Fars—Jahrom—became impoverished. They are notoriously bad farmers. During the settlement very many sheep, goats and horses were killed off and the numbers of the tribe were depleted by death and the break up of the sub-tribes. The figure given for the Arabs in 1918 was 10,000 families. In 1944 it was reduced to just over 6,000. During the 1914-18 war the Arabs remained quiet while Qavam ul Mulk fought the Qashq i and their reputation for submission to the Government dates from that time. Unlike the Qashqai they male no organized rewolt against or resistance to Reza Shah’s oppressive treatment although they were forced to pay the usual bribes to the Military Governors for the privilege of migrating. Robbery on the roads and between the sub-tribes continued on a small scale during the reign of Pahlevi. After the allied occupation in 1941 the Arabs commenced rearming and re-* sumed their former free migration. Most of their rifles were obtained by purchase from Army deserters or were dug up from former caches ; a few were smuggled i n through the Persian Gulf and others stolen from the military. The tribal chiefs who under the Military Governorship had had little or no say in administration re gained their authority and position. Qavam ul Mulk had retained his family’s hereditary attachment to the tribe but since he put in no personal appearance and had no direct dealings with the chiefs his leadership was not effective. - Tho kalantars became responsible to the Government for the security of their sub-* sections but robberies and fighting occurred more frequently than before. Tho Arabs claim that they in particular suffered much from the maladministra* tion of the Military Governors of Khamseh, Captain Amir Sadri and Colonel Razmju successively, between 1942 and 1944. With the appointment of S'ehebdivuni as cml Governor to the Khamseh in 1944 security improved little and conditions within the tribe became worse owing to th e ♦The Arab, although not a “ group of tribes ” in the same sense as Qashqai, is exceptionally known as Il-e^Arab and not Taycfeh-yc Arab. * %120 Governor’s incompetence and, suspected, venality. During 1944 robberies and bold-ups in the Arab district continued to be bold and very frequent. In 1945 when the Farmandar of Fasu took over control of Khamseh the Arabs came under a sterner and juster rule. Security improved immensely and there was a marked decrease in inter-tribal robbery. The new Governor claims that many of the misdeeds attributed to the Arabs may well have been the work of villagers in the Arab area or of other tribes. The new administration ensures that the Arabs get a regular supply of monopoly goods and protects their economic interests so far as is possible. As a result prosperity has shown signs of returning to them. TERRITORY Maps : ..

N.B .—Very few Arabs spend the winter north-west of Fast? or Jahrom. An imaginary line roughly from Khafr to Kuh-e Ahmadi. 3. Physical (Terrain, Climate and Agriculture) (a) Summer Quarters A number of valleys running east and west from the main Shiraz-Isfahan road make up the summer quarters. In these valleys some of the Arab khans own small patches of land where the local peasantry grow barley , wheat, beans and fruit. Inthe main, tiowevef, the Arabs use their land for grazing alone ; the large and fertile valley of Mervdasht whose winter climate is mild, Khafrak and K ha ranch with a plentiful and undeveloped water supply in the Kur River is inhabited by Arabs in the summer who drive their flocks to the foothills and ignore the plain’s potential agricultural wealth. The Kur River empties almost its entire Volume into the Tashk salt lake (UJ). One 400-year old dam at Band-e Amir and five smaller dams further downstream draw off a negligible part of the water of the river for irrigation. On the high, cool and wind-swept plateau around Behind sheep-grazing is almost the only means of livelihood as it is in the narrow valley of Bavravct (UD3074) and the plain running from Qvderubvd (UC95) east to Chehvrrvh. All are bitterly cold in winter. There is considerably more cultivation in the well-watered Moshkun (UC5989) valley which, though under snow in winter, has been chosen by the Arab khans for barley, beans and fruit cultivation. The Sa’i detubvd (UC83) valley is under intensive cultivation by Shiraz landowners and the Arabs graze their flocks on the hills around. This concentration on sheep-breeding makes the Arabs almost entirely dependent on wool, cooking fat, skins and mutton for their income. (b) Winter Quarters The Fasa and Jahrom plains are among the most fertile areas of Bars : both are broad and well-watered by springs and under ground water-channels. The great plain south and south-west of B-er-cb where hundreds of Arab families graze their flocks in winter and spring is described under BAHyRLU-TERRITORY. The Furg plain (QL0149) into which a few of the Arab tribe penetrate in winter is also potentially a wealthy agricultural area although very sparsely populated and almost entirely without communications. In the Fasu and Jahrom areas the Arabs keep largely to the pasture land and le^ve agricultural development to Shiraz land- owners. Their aversion to agriculture constitutes the chief Arab objection to settle ment. South-eastern Fars produces dates, oranges and other fruits together with rice, cotton and tobacco in summer and large crops of wheat and barley in the winter and spring. Much rich land is uncultivated. Although the Arabs declare their readiness to settle here and in the Mervdasht plain provided the Government buys the land, provides irrigation facilities and housing and finances their initial agri cultural efforts it is likely to be long before this shiftless people makes a success of agriculture. N.B .—Many of the Arab khans have purchased property in the winter quarters but the farming there is done almost entirely by the settled peasantry who bear no relationship to the Arab tribe. COMMUNICATIONS 1. External (a) Summer Quarters The main Shiraz-Isfahan road has a few motorable tracks leading off it to east and west and giving access to the Arab summer quarters. The administrative centres during this season are Behbid and Mervdasht. (i) Surmaq to Eqlid : summer only surface fair. (u) Dehbid to Bavcn , et and Mazijnn (UB55): summer only ; surface satis factory. (in) Qcderubcd (UC95) to Bugh-e Shh (approx. UB2519) and Cheh'erreh (UD5127): surface poor; passable in summer only.m {iv) Sa^dettjbTid to Khafrak district and Arsenin (UD01): surface satis- factory : summer only. M Mervdasht to Band-e Amir (UH59), Kl'aremeh (UJOG), along south shore of lashk salt lake to Rimiz-e Boh (UJ53). Minn Jangal (UJ22) and Faso : sur- lace very bad but passable in summer for a jeep. (vi) Shiraz to Bnrdij (t H57) and Kharumeli; surface very bad in summer and winter : passable for stout car. (b) Winter Quarters Access to the Arab winter quarters is fairly easy by the main roads of Fast? and Lurestsn. These are generally passable in winter but throughout the year surfaces are very poor. They include the Shiraz-Fasu road and three roads radiat ing from Fasu : one to Jahrom, Juyom and Lur, a second to Dumb and a third to Estahbvnut, Ninz and ybudeh Tashk (UD40), this last being exceptionally rough. There are no motorable side roads shown on the map of this area but a jeep can be taken to many of the mam winter camping grounds across ill-defined desert tracks. The administrative centre in winter of the Arab tribe is Fast?. 2. Internal—Migration The general lines of migration of the entire Arab tribe are two. The section that winters m the Fast? and Dumb areas passes through Sarvestun (UH94) and Kharumeh and thence either remains in the Mervdasht district or proceeds bv wav of Arsenjun or Sa udetubud to the Dehbid plateau. The section that winters in the Juyom district and the area to the north and east moves through Ootbubud iTIfUTi to Khafr (UJOO) and thence to Sarvestun where it joins up with the first section In recent years the latter route has been less used than the former.

ECONOMIC The Arab tribe relies principally on its flocks of sheep and goats for its liveli hood. Another important item in tribal economy are the camels and horses. In the summer quarters these are hired out for the transport of the beet and cereals crops to Mervdasht and Shiraz respectively and in the winter quarters for the carrying of cereals and other produce to town stores and markets. With markets in Dehbid, Mervdasht and Shiraz in summer and Fasv, Jahrom and Dereb in winter they trade their cooking-fat, mutton, wool, and skins for rice, grain, free-market sugar and tea and other commodities. In clothes, fruit, fuel and most of the necessities of life they are self-supporting. Practically all trade is carried on through the khans and the khans are thus the only members of the tribe who have monCy. They are consequently responsible for the welfare of their people so far as goods not produced within the tribe are con cerned and they handle the supply of monopoly goods. This supply is organized on what the Governor has described as the only workable system : the khans sell in the black market one half of the ration of monopoly goods to pay for the other half which they give to their people. By any other system the Arab people would receive no tea, sugar or cloth at all since they themselves have no money to buy the goods. J y Some of the khans of the tribe own property in both the summer and winter quarters where they produce crops of grain, beans, fruit and rice in the summer quarters and grain, dates, opium and rice in the winter quarters. No taxes are collected from the Arab tribesmen and the khans pay no taxes on their lands The Arab tribe is probably the least prosperous tribe of Ears. The reasons for this have been given under PEOPLE. So far as future schemes for bettering their condition are concerned results are likely to be disappointing. The Arabs describe their period of enforced settlement under Reza Shah as the low water mark of their economic “ depression ” and state that the best hope of prosperity is free miffration and an efficient and just civil Governor. h 1 1 RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURING TRIBES In their summer quarters the Arabs camp just to the east of sections of th Qashqai (principally Sheshboluki). Invariably, however, they leave a strin of man’s-land about 15 miles wide between themselves and their more prosn n °' neighbours. Despite this precaution theft and counter-theft of flocks and ne™ 10 ^ property is unending. Settlement of disputes is made by negotiation betiLwv Governor of Khamseh and Nuser Khan Qashqai. en The Arabs attribute the affluence of the Qashqai to their two years of . lawry from 1941 to 1943 when they indulged in wholesale pillaging and looting villages in their area. They admit their own indulgence in robberies and h u ° f in the years that followed the allied occupation but point out that these wpt UpS on a scale large enough to constitute active opposition to the GovernmpJT\ neVer enem^ 6 ^ Pr ° feSS t0 ^ the Qa8h( * ai a 8mart but ^r from formidable MSTArmy124 THE PEOPLE The average tribesman is tall and lean. Complexions a,re ruddier than else where in Ears. Almost without exception the khans look like, and are, crooks. The people are a ragged and undernourished-looking rabble but this is largely due to economic conditions and their own lack of industry. Unlike the Turki-speaking tribes, the Arabs are lazy, dirty and careless. This, and not the nature of their territory, accounts for the lower standard of living in Arab than in Qasbqai. This also partly explains their indulgence in petty theft and robbery. The outstanding Arab quality is bravery which was shown in operations against the South Persia Hifles during 1917 and 1918. Since then the Arabs have engaged in no major conflicts and so have not been put to the test. From all accounts they are considerably more formidable fighters than, for instance, the Qashqai nomads. Their religion is Shi’ah Islam ; the people are not given to practising their faith. STRENGTH * The strength of the Arab tribe is about 6,165 families or roughly about (31,000) souls. Practically all of this total appears to be migratory. The Arabs probably possess about 3,000 rifles of all types and vintages. Of this number little more than 1,500 are modern weapons (Brno, Lee Enfield, Mauser and Russian models). Fighting strength (armed men) is estimated at about 2,000. The number of mounted armed men is negligible. ANALYSIS OF ARAB SUB-TRIBES In the following tables the Arab tribe is divided into its two sections, Shoibimi and Jabbereh. The two sections are split into their different sub-tribes and each sub-tribe into its sub-sections, if any. Where a sub-tribe consists of two or more sections these sections are indicated by the vertical writing in the second column. The numbers quoted were obtained in the presence of the Governor who parti cularly requested khans to give the correct figure and not that invented to obtain extra rations from the Finance Department. Numbers of sub-sections are not given , as even the khans themselves are uncertain of the numbers of their sub-sections. | The latter frequently intermingle or camp apart from their respective sub-tribes. The names of the chiefs (kalantars) of the sub-tribes only are given and even these hold only a very temporary appointment. The heads of the sub-sections (kadkhodas) are appointed by the Jcalantars (see ORGANIZATION) and are conti nually being removed and reappointed. No names of kadkhodas are therefore given. In some instances lines of migration of individual sub-tribes appear as varia tions of the main routes (see COMMUNICATIONS—INTERNAL). The com ments on the reputation of the sub-tribes were supplied by the Governor. The location of the summer and winter quarters of each sub-tribe is liable in change at any time. Note.—M any sub-tribes are divided into two sections with one section bearing the sub- tribal name and the other section being called Jam 'i- In these oases the first section is the original sub-tribe and Jam ’» means “people subsequently incorporated ” or “attached sub sections SHEIByNI128 A.

It is not possible to give the present-day Btfseri tribe a “ racial ” origin. It is said tbat tlie tribe originated in Kborns'en and is made up of the descendants of the clans lead by three brothers, Musu, Qolombehi and Adbol. There are still in exist ence in the tribe three sub-sections which bear the above names. The Bcseri appear to have taken in dissenting sections of Arab and Turk tribes and they certainly swallowed up numbers of villagers who till the land on which the Buseri camp and who join the migration and call themselves Buseri. They were once under the authority of the leader of the Arab tribes and their language is a co- ruption of Arabic. HISTORY. The Buseri section of Khamseh suffered few hardships in the reign of Reza Shah. Although, in common with most of Khamseh, they possessed a reputation for robbery they were not reckoned a threat to Government authority and after their disarmament in the late twenties were not molested to the same extent as Qashqai. Settlement was enforced in 1933 and lasted until 1941. Many tribes evaded this by paying the necessary bribes to Government officials. No particulararea was fixed for them by the Government so the tribe built its villages both in the south around Fast? and in the north around Mervdasht. They took up agriculture on a fair scale ; stock breeding took second place among them. Some of the khans hold that this period was one of considerable prosperity ; others say Notes ,.

Tiiis area consists of tbe two valleys of Kordsbul and Abmadubud running paral lel to one an other from south-east to north-west and separated by the mountain- raD|C of Seyyed Mohammad Kuh, with peaks of over 11,000 feet. The northern (Kordshul) valley is well-watered by springs. There is no paren- nial river running through this valley as marked on the map and the marsh shown on the map at the south-eastern end of the valley (UC47) exists only after heavy rain. The valley is m general level and^he soil fertile. It contains a number of settled communities including Aliubud, yb Burik, Kordsbul, Kuftar and the small village of Khonjesht (approx. UC4588). In the north-west the valley opens outits position n'.ake it very hot and oppressive. Away from the wells and the Mand river the plain in summer is a desert. Vegetation dries up and the only trees are ** those found around inhabited localities. B. Agriulture. . (i) Summer Quarters. Along the lines of the river beds in both the valleys of the summer quarters a fair amount of cultivation is centred mostly around the villages. The main crops are of wheat and barely but opium, maize, peas and beans are also grown. The tribesmen reap only one crop during the year owing to their short stay. No work is possible in the fields during the severe winter months and the villagers sow in early spring. (it) Winter Quarters. In the winter quarters the Buseri tribe indulge casually in agriculture. Around the few villages oranges and melons, dates and other fruit are grown in summer and throughout the plain in winter crops of wheat and barley watered by the winter rains, are produced. Note ; The principal occupation of the Bused tribe since the rail of Reza Shah has been tending their flocks of sheep and goats. These they graze in the summer quarters until about October when the cold weather arrives. On the low hills of the winter quarters grazing is found until April when it dries up in the hot sun. COMMUNICATIONS. 1. External. (i) Summer Quarters. There is one track leading west from the Shiraz-Isfahan road that gives access to the Buseri summer quarters. A jeep has been taken over the track from Dehbid to Khonjesht and thence across the Bezan pass to Ahmadubed. From Ahmada- bad it is just possible by jeep to reach Sirbanu to the east and ysopus to the north west. This track is very difficult in summer and impassable in winter. (n) Winter Quarters. The main road from Jahrom south-east to Lur is the nearest motorable road to the winter quarters. From Jahrom an animal track leads south-west and from Juyom tracks lead west into the plain, but none of these tracks has' been covered by motor transport. The ground is quite level and could probably be covered in a jeep or stout car. tf;// 2. Internal-Migration. The line of migration of the Buseri tribe is the same as that of the main bo^’y of the Arabs. From the Banuruyeh-Juyom plain it lies through Jahrom, Sarvestan and Kharumeh (UJ0766) and thence to the Band-e Amir plaim. From there the various sub-sections of Buseri disperse to their quarters west of the Isfahan road, some via Rumjerd (UC33) and Muhin (UC34) and others by Sivand and Quderubud, on the main road. Other internal communications are described under PHYSICAL Summer Quar ters. ORGANIZATION. In common with the rest of Khamseh the Buseri regard Qavam ul Mulk as their titular leader and he is referred to in the tribe as “ yqu ”. As Qavam himself plays no part in tribal affairs, the Icalantar of Buseri, Mohammad Zarghumi, is res ponsible for the behaviour of his people to the Governor (sarperast). If Zargh bet’scontrol is not satisfactory and he is removed from the post the kalantar^nr, does not necessarily pass to a member of his family. The appointment lies entirely in the hands of the Governor of Khamseh. ire V in Under the Mcmtor the heads of the different sub-sections control s m ,ll of tribes people These kadHodas are appointed by the Plantar but are freemenHy removed by order of the Governor. They are nominally responsible for the beha viour of their sub-sections to the Mantar but in fact the Governor of Kl-amseh deals' with them personally side-tracking the /tahntar in many instances Only 1 ei way can the venality of the lealantar be circumvented. ' • • ly in this ECONOMIC. The nomadic members of the Bnseri tribe rely for the most part on their flocks for their income. Some of the settled sections (like the Kara mi andSaL.* - sub-sections which are only attached to Buseri and are not pure Bsseri trih , “l* profit from the sale of cattle and their harvest of cereals which totals about^n' 1.000 tons. The income from the grain harvest in the summer „s goes pr ~ eipally into the pockets of the khans who own small properties in this area ^ A n trade is done in lambskins but in general the tribe finds it ml prefitaW;';' market the full-grown sheep. The produce of the flocks such as meat cookierr fat wool etc., is mostly consumed within the tribe. The rugs and blankets’nrodrn-S by the tribe are principally for home use. ™aDKets produced _ Conditions in Buseri are slightly better than among the Arab but do not recoil the standard of Qashqai, their neighbours. No taxes are paid to the Government and officially the kalantar takes no contribution from the tribe He howev er hTr d if th/trife G ° VCrnment m0D0P ° ly 8 ° 0dS and 011 the ‘^TrSot According to the khans, the tribe enjoyed several years of comparative urns, penty before the rule of Reza Shah. It seems likely however that during ft« settlement period they were wealthier than ever before or since. g 1 RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURS. (») Summer Quarters. North ..' Arab. East ..

If Vhe settlement of such incidents were left to the khans a few bribes would be passed and the matter forgotten. As it is the Governor sees that the stolen goods are res tored and has f ke offending khans reprimanded or removed. Relations between thv.'.o two sections of Khamsch are uneasy but they would undoubtedly help one another in an emergency. The Kordohuli seem to tolerate the comings and goings of Buseri on their lands and msko no con hl ints. Relations between them appear to be satisfactory. The rcttlcd villagers who lie.ye contact with Beseri know them as incurable robbers and thieves who should be kept as far away as possible. THE PEOPLE. The Rscori tribesman is a graceless person of medium height and heavy build. His exceptionally dark complexion, similar to that of the Arab , combines with Ins coarse and unrefined facial features to give him a rough, loutish appearance which compares poorly with that of his Qashqai neighbours. Large hooked noses and heavy chins arc even more noticeable in Buseri than in the other tribes of Pars. Their women a average height and possess similarly marked features. A large pri. n intelligence as is to be found in Baseri is turned to evh ends. The crooked sh, ^rery type of khan is as commonly seen as among the Arabs. Baseri tribespeople are generally lazy and unclean in their habits and way of life. Living conditions are very poor and +he standard of health is little above the low Khamsch average. Malaria is found everywhere and trachoma is common. Medical facilities do not exist. Although during the time of enforced settlement the Baser! were obliged to send their children to study at Government sohsols they have made no effort since 1941 to remedy the illiteracy that prevails among them. Religion is Shi’ah Islam but little observance is apparent. STRENGTH. The total number of Beseri in 1945 was about 2,500 families which is 5,000 loub less than their 1918 total of 3,500 families. Several reliable estimates put Bnseri fighting strength at one thousand armed men. These estimates are based on the number of rifles which totals 1,000 of all types. There are probably about 400 modern rifles in Buseri so that 500 fighting men with two or three hundred stragglers is probably the full Bcseri fighting strength. Baser! have net the fighting reputation of the Arabs but they are regarded with respect by their neighbours and it is commonly believed, and it is a Bvseri boast, that they would fight for their land and property. ANALYSIS OF SUB-SECTIONS. The numbers given in the following table are believed to be fairly accurate* They were checked with those recorded by the Governor of Khamseh and rechecked by reference to the lealmtar in the presence of a number of Arab chiefs eager to chal- leage any exaggerations. The table divides the Buseri into two sections, Ali Mirzui and Vaisi, and these two sections arc themselves split into the different sub-sections. The sub-section* are in turn divided into their numerous family groups. The names of the heads of each family group are not given as they are of no significance. The names of the kadkhodcis of each sub-section are given (although the kadkhoda-ship is far from being a permanent post) together with details of summer and winter quarters a ad the number of families in each sub-section,APPENDIX I—PERSONALITIES Mohammad Khan Zarghvmi .—Born about 1913.

Originally nomadic, the tribe is now settled in the Fasu district. HISTORY The Ainulu abandoned their migratory life in the early ] 920’s. Some section* continued to move northwards in poor years and it was not until the late twenties that at the request of Qavam ul Mulk they all became entirely sedentary. In the time of Reza Shah the leader of the Ainelu was Abol Qesem Arjomand. He was still in charge in 1945. He had the good sense to keep his tribe under tight control during the Pahlevi rule and their good behaviour had the happy result of warding off corrupt and unscrupulous Government officials. A fixed tribute was de manded from Ainulu during this period and Arjomand saw that it was promptly paid. This tribute was a strain on the tribal economy but conditions never became desperate jn the Ainalu villages. Having seen bis tribe successfully survive the Pahlevi regime Arjomand was able to do much to increase its prosperity during the years that followed Raza Shah’s abdication. He was fortunate in having a mild landlord. Compared with other Khamseh peoples the Ainulu are well behaved and lawlessness in their area is seldom the fault of these tribesmen but rather that of raiding bandits. Their income has increased considerably since 1942 and under a benevolent chief there has been a corresponding improvement in their living, conditions. t TERRITORY Map : H39X, Oct ’41 ; H40S, Mar ’42. 1. Position The tribe is settled in three main districts : Shesh Deh and Qarabolugh in the Fasn area, 20 miles east and 16 miles south-east of Fasu town respectively and in the Rudbul valley north-west of Dsrvb.^ Other families are found around Fas« town. ^ 2. Boundaries Since the tribe keeps to its villages no definition of their habitat other than that given above,is necessary. Map references of all villages (see ANALYSIS) are given where possible. 3. Physical. Qarabolvgh is an uneven, slightly rolling plain broken by low mounds at irregular intervals. Dry watercourses cut across it from the hills and a small stream which . dries up in summer flows across its south-eastern border. The surrounding hills are completely barrenjand all,.uncultivated ftrea^are quite devoid of vegetation after April. £ Shesh DeLis thejiame^ivon tpalqng narrpw^ alley running frojn.east to west with » slight northerly trend. It is about ^0 miles long and 4-5 miles wide. From the ■unrounding hills flow streams which are put underground in channels and brought into the valley for irrigation. The valley floor is fairly level, grass-covered in spring and bare in summer where not under cultivation. TbeHudb?! valley appears tp be a basin in tbe centre of the precipitous moun tains north of Du rub. It is reputed to be well-watered and fertile and communicates the Bhesh Deh valle/itf4ht *v by way of narrow and difficult passes with143 **' The Ainslu territory lies in the hills and valleys within or immediately to the south of the precipitous limestone ridge that divides the Fasu—Dunjb plains from the Estahbnnet and Niriz valleys in the north. 4 . Climate ' In winter the climate is mild and warm. Snow very rarely falls and the rain supply although not abundant is sufficient for a much greater area than it is customary to cultivate. The rainfall feeds springs and streams that are run off into underground channels in the Shesh Deh and Rudbel districts and fill water tanks and shallow wells in the Qarabolugh region. After April the south begins to dry out and by June the grass is burnt off and all land not under cullivation becomes a bare desert. The heat is intense : all surface moisture and streams disappear entirely. B. Agriculture Products from the Ainulu lands in winter are wheat, barely, beans and other vegetables; in summer a second crop of cereals is grown together with crops of maize, opium, cotton, rice, dates and oranges. The amount of surplus produce from the- Ainulu lands is uncertain but roughly half of the available land is under cultivatioa* The total annual wheat and barley crop reaches approximately 1,000 tons.- COMMUNICATIONS 1. External The road from Fasu to Durub passes through the centre of Qarabolngh. - Track! run off to isloated villages. A track leaves the main Fasu-Dureb road at Khoshkrud and reaches QaPeh-ye Arjomand Khan with rough branch tracks conneeting smaller hamlets in this, the Shesh Deh, region. The Rudbcl portion of Ainulu is accessible only by horse from Shesh Deh. The main road, although very rough, is passable throughout the yeftf except after exceptionally heavy rain when torrents and wash-outs mAy block it. 2. Internal A network of roughly defined tracks links up many villages in the various district* of Ainulu. In most places a stout car will meet few obstacles to progress across the open plain except water channels. In the-hills there-is no means of oommucioation except animal tracks. ORGANIZATION Under the civil Governor of Khumseh, who controls the tribe from Fasu authoritj over the tribe rests with the Mantar, Abol Qusetn Khan Arjomand. Arjomand proved himself so reliable that there is no gendarmerie in his district and he and hi* subordinates maintain order and are responsible for security to the Khemseh Gover nor only. This they achieve by good rule. They hold a few Government-issued rifles. In the analysis of Ainulu each sub-tribe has the name of * chief written opposite it. This chief is in reality little more than the 44 head man ” of the village and hi* appointment depends on the villagers and the approval of the kalantar. He keep! order and settles disputes so far as he is able. Thereafter he calls intheaeaistanea af the kalantar and hi* armed men if necewety.m. ECONOMIC Conditions in Aintilu are good. Since 1941 the income of the tribe has increased and the Government tax has been abolished. Arjomand himself is known as a bene\ o- lent leader. For instance the Qarabolvgh district is owned by the widow of Nazm ul Mulk, Leqv ed Douleh, who takes one tenth of all produce and allocates one fortieth to Arjomand. The latter exacts no additional tribute by irregular means and the rest of the income goes back to the tribespeople. In Shesh Deh the chief villagers own their own property outright and are reported to deal very fairly with their peasantry. The Governor of Khamseh reports that this tribe has received satisfactory supplies of Government monopoly goods since the monopoly system was introduced. Markets are Fasti and D^rcb where the people purchase household goods, clothes etc. RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURS As mentioned under the heading PEOPLE the Aintilu tribespecple have not intermingled with the native Persian villagers in their area. Thus a village of pure Ain'ulu population will neighbour a pure Persian village. Relations between the two peoples are as a rule cordial. The Ainulu suffer no less than other settled farmers from the plundering and thieving of the Arabs who overrun the area in winter. In general they have no enmities and clash only with marauding tribal migrants and bands of thieves. THE PEOPLE Spoken of as a reliable type of man, honest and, for Khamseh, hard-working the Ainulu tribesman displays qualities not commonly found in the other Khamseh tribes. His industry is possibly attributable to his Turk origin. This may also account for his- appeaxanoe which more resembles the bold bearing of the Qashqai than that of the uncouth Arabs. The Khans are also of a nobler breed than their Arab counterparts. The Ainnlu have maintained their independence in that they have not inter married or settled with the Persians native to their area. They keep to themselves and live in separate communities. Their way of life is little above the standard of cleanliness ruling in the district. Their health is deteriorating because of the spread of typhoid by polluted water supplies. Typhus is common and arises from dirty living conditions which foster other contagious diseases. STRENGTH The Ainalu total 1,410 families or 7,050 souls. In 1918 their numbers were given as 1,200 families. They own about 100 rifles acquired from Government and private sources. Ainulu tribesmen are said to make excellent foot-soldiers but in recent history there has been no occasion to put this reputation to the test. ANALYSIS OF SUB-SECTIONS In the following table a list of the sub-sections of Aintdu is given together with village occupied by.each sub-section, the number of its members and the name of its “ head man ,J . Where marked on the map or otherwise available the map reference of each village is given.148 BAHyRLU ORIGIN The Bah^rlu tribe is of Turkish origin and came to Fars during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. HISTORY In 1918 the Bahurlu had already been settled for many years and they hava since shown no signs of returning to a nomadic way of life. Once the fiercest fighters in Khumseh and a terror to their neighbours, the BahCTlu were suppressed by Qavam ul Hulk in 1917 and suffered severe losses in the fighting against Qashqai near Shiraz in 1918. Poverty and disease further depleted their numbers and in 1945 they totalled scarcely 1,000 familes. They have lost their fighting reputation and their once famous horsemen no longer exist. It is not surprising that with their reputation for lawlessness the Bahrrlu had a hard time during Reza Shah's reign. All the villages were taken away from the khan who previously owned them and left in charge of the gendarmerie. Heavy taxes wer® exacted by land-lords and extortion was rife among Government officials in their district. The three leading khans were removed to Tehran where two of them Q'esem and Abol Hossein Khans, died and the third, Amir yqu Khan, survived to return to the tribe in 1941. After 1941 Government control over the tribe relaxed and taxes were no longer collected. Amir yqu Khan returned and those who remained of the former khans, or their descendants, again took charge of the Bahurlu villages. The Bahcrlu thus-lost one set of oppressive masters and gained another and although their income has doub led since 1941 the lot of the people has seen no improvement. They have been guilty^ of much lawlessness although not on a scale comparable with that of the nomadic tribes. In their dealings with officials and traders they have earned a reputation for unreliability for which the khans can be fairly blamed. TERRITORY Map : H40S, Mar ’42. 1. Position The tribe is settled in a series of small villages in the DErub-Deh Khair plain and to the south in the Khosu district. Small sections have settled in the hills to the north and east and others have penetrated the plains further south than Khosu. 2. Boundaries The main body of the Bahurlu tribe is settled in the villages included by the boundaries given below. Other groups are scattered outside these boundaries fcS mentioned under POSITION. North-east .. From point UP1896 in N. SE to point UP3582. Point UP3582 SW to Bizd*n (UP2379), thence SE to Mivn Deh (UP2767)* South-west .. Mitm Deh NW to UP1896 including Khosu village (UP26). 3. Physical The Dumb plain is a dead flat stretch of land 30 miles long (east to west) and 12 miles wide broken by about six rock outcrops. It is entirely ringed by mountains, in the north these rise very suddenly and precipitously to heights of 10,000 feet (7,000149 feet abotfe the plain) and are practicably impenetrable (a very difficult animal track gives access to the adjacent plain of Niriz). A series of valleys and passes leads off from the eastern corner of the plain towards Furg and another series in the west towards Fas*. To the south-east and south-west two steep mountain ranges (7,— 8,000 feet) complete the ring and meet (a few miles north of Khosu) in a narrow gap through which the road from Dercb to Khosu and Juyom has been constructed. Several large springs in the northern mountains water the Dercb plain through out the year and even in late summer water is plentiful in the streams and irrigation canals. Many underground channels tap other smaller springs in the hills and carry the water to the fields. The Khosu plain, which lies a few hundred feet higher than the Dcrnb plain, is at the northern extremity of a vast flat area of land that is divided into two parts by a line of mountains (not marked on the map) running in a north-west to south-east direction through Juyom to the mountain masses around Ler. The northern part which extends from Juyom in the west to within 25 miles of Furg in the east and to the mountains around Lur in the south is broken throughout by chains and masses of mountains, (5,-8,000 feet) which emerge from the flat land like islands from the sea. For about 75 miles the desert track from Khosu south-west to Juyom winds round these mountain masses without climbing over any passes or even the slightest rise and making a sharp contrast with the steep passes, saddles and cols that link the valleys of northern and western Fars. The land becomes progressively more barren and arid as Khosu is left behind and very soon turns into a waterless desert, habitable only in winter and spring when the tribespeople graze their flocks there after the winter rains. The southern part, which is known as the Bamsruyeh-Juyom plain and stretches nearly to Lar in the south-east, is reached from the northern part by a precipitous descent (500—1,000 ft.) of the line of mountains already mentioned and stretches on west towards the Qir and Karzin (Qashqai) lowlands. For a further description of this area see BySERl—TERRITORY—Winter Quarters. 4. Climate A mild winter with three months of showers and little really cold weather to gether with a very hot dry summer are typical of the climate of Dumb. The cool damp of the winter favours the cultivation of cereals and the heat and adequate water supply from wells and channels in the summer encourages noe production. Rice cultivation accounts for the high incidence of malaria. The intense summer heat makes stock raising nearly impossible and horses and camels are the only animals found in large numbers in Bahsrlu villages. 5. Agriculture The Durub district is one of the more productive areas of Fars. The Bahwlu, like the rest of the inhabitants of the area, sell much produce from their land in both summer and winter. In winter heavy crops of wheat, barley and vegetables are rea ped ; in summer a second crop of cereals is reaped together with rice, opium, maize, cotton, dates and citrous fruits. The amount of surplus produce which the Bahnrlu people market in Dcrcb and Khosu is not known since record is kept by the supply department only of purchases from individual villages which contain a mixed popu lation of Bahnrlu and native Persians. Only about half of the water supply of the D«r«b valley is utilised and great areas of fertile land lie uncult wted.150 COMMUNICATIONS 1. External Access to the Bahrarlu district is easy by means of the main Fasra to Dwreb road from which branch tracks connect with the villages in the Dr^rab plain. A good motorable track leads south from Difrub to Khosu and its continuation permits motor transport to reach the barren southern plain between Khosu and Juyom. In the Khosu plain many villages are accessible from the road as all this country is level and broken by very few irrigation channels. The hill settlements of Bahvrlu can only be reached by animal transport, 2. Internal During 1943 and 1944 grain collecting trucks covered most of the ground in the D«r«b and Khosu valleys. A stout car will cover much of this area in summer but in winter it is a quagmire and impassable. ORGANIZATION The head of the Bahurlu tribe is Amir yqu Khan who assumed control of the tribe a'’ter the fall of Reza Shah. He holds his appointment from the Governor of Khamseh. In principle the Bahvrlu tribesmen could rid themselves of this Ka- lantar by complaining to the Governor, Amir yqs Khan has succumbed to the effects of opium and is no longer capable of exercising close control over the tribe. He therefore concentrates on collecting excessive taxes and leaves the welfare of the tribe to chance. His khans follow his example : they take the maximum of taxes from their tribespeople and do little or nothing for them in return. They perform few of the duties of khans such as seeing that a satisfactory supply of monopoly goods is maintained and protecting the rights of their people. Thus feuds and quarrels are frequent in Baharlu as a result of never ending inter-tribal theft and pilferage. It frequently happens that a head man oversteps himself and is obliged to leave his village in a hurry. A new man then takes over charge of the village and as a rule is soon as grasping as his predecessor. This lack of permanency in the appointment of village head men accounts for the absence of their names in the analysis of Bahvrlu sub-sections. ECONOMIC With markets in Dumb and Khosu the khans of Bahurlu sell the surplus crops from their villages to be transported to Shiraz and to deficit areas such as Lur. The khans also appropriate a large part of all crops grown on the land under their super vision whether surplus or not. The result is that the average Bahurlu khan lives in considerable comfort (Bahurlu land is very fertile) while conditions among the people are as low as is to be found in Ears. They give the impression of a fine people having sunk into squalor and disease. RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURS The Baburin have so intermingled with the native population of their area that they are frequently no longer racially distinct from their Persian neighbours. Yet in151 X2 tnany cases the Baharlti population of a village is at odds with the rest of the villagers and thefts and raids are not uncommon both between Bahnrlu and Persians and amongst theBah^rlu themselves. The neighbouring Ainulu have no respect for the Balmlu and regard them as untrustworthy. The Governor of Khamseh says that this description fits these people in whom he himself places no reliance. THE PEOPLE In appearance the Bahurlu resemble the other Turk tribes of Ears, but because, of intermarriage with the Persians native to the Dnr^b area many of them are losing their fine features. Among the armed following of the village head men are still to be found the usual Turk types tall and spare with dark hair and eyes and a beak Hose. They occasionally wear the traditional Turk tribal costume {for description see QASHQAI). In their way of life the Bahnrlu have sunk to the level of the native Persians They live in squalor which is a product partly of their degeneration and partly of the impoverished conditions that result from the rapacity of the khans. The filth of their habits and environment encourages the spread of trachoma, typhoid and many other infectious or contagious diseases. Their appearance shows the effects of these diseases. The Bahsrlu tribesman is much inclined towards robbery and any sort of law lessness. He is quite untrustworthy and unreliable and steals on any occasion on which he thinks he can escape undetected. STRENGTH In 1944 the lealavtar of Baherlu stated that his tribe totalled 3 523 men, women and children. As previous estimates varied around 700 families this figure is pro bably correct. There can be no more than 50 rifles in the possessions of Baharlu tribesmen of which about 30 together with a supply of ammunition are issued by the Governor for the maintenance of Order. ANALYSIS OF SUB-SECTIONS The Balmlu are divided into two sections, Varaseh and Tarakeh. The table that follows shows this division and gives the names of all the sub-sections in each of the two sections, together with the names of all the small family groups in each sub-section. The numbers of each family group are given although some are so small as to be of no significance. The figures quoted in the left-hand column of ** NO. OF FAMILIES” are those of the groups of tribespeople serving the khans personally and bearing the names of the sub-sections themselves as opposed to the name of one of the family groups. The location of each sub-section is not given. There are a great number of villages in the Dcreb and Khosu area and frequently a sub-section is split up among several villages. The names of the headmen of villages are also omitted. The head men are frequently not Baharlu natives but Persian and they are continually being changed. fNAFAR ORIGIN Nafar, the fifth of the “ five tribes ”, has lost all significance in the tribal organiza tion of Ears and is mentioned here for purposes of record only. The tribe is of Turki origin and the language of the remaining tribesmen is Turki. It became separated from the Persian Turki tribes before the formation of Qashqai as a tribal group and has had no subsequent connexion with Qashqai. Some of the sub-tribes of Qashqai include sub-sections with the name of Nafar but the con nexion, if any, of these sub-sections wuth the Nafar of Khamseh dates back to the period before the appearance of the name Qashqai. HISTORY The Nafar were recorded in 1918 as being sedentary in the Gernsh (UT96) district west of Lur and in the Mervdasht plain. It is uncertain whether the Nafar resumed partial migration between 1918 and 1923 or whether they in fact always sent part of their number with the tribal flocks and herds when the rest of the Khamseh moved to •ummer and winter quarters. The Governor of Khamseh, Amir Arfa, has stated that Reza Shah’s officials forced the Nafar to settle in the late twenties, partly in the Bummer quarters at Rcmjerd (UC33) and partly in the winter quarters, at Sahrn-ye Bugh, a district about 15 miles south-west of Iver. The Rnmjerd section took to agriculture but on the fall of Reza Shah again concentrated their attention on sheep breeding and from 1942 until 1945 regularly sent a group of shepherds with their animals to spend the winter in Sarvestsn (UH93). The Lur section has shifted its centre from Gerush but does not seem to have been nomadic for more than 30 years. Throughout the year however they move, in search of fresh pasture, within a radius of 15 miles of their centre at Sahrs-ye Bt gh. The Nafar tribe has become scattered and reduced in numbers to such an extent that it occupies a less important position in the Khamseh administration than many small attached tribes such as Lashani. RyMJERD SECTION The Rnmjerd plain is a most productive area, owned largely by Shiraz landlords. The Nafar tribespeople settled in the district do not, with one exception, own their own land. The plain, a description of whose physical features and climate can be found under other tribal headings of Khamseh, is watered by a series of irrigation channels drawn off the Kur River 6 miles to the west by means of a wooden barrage rebuilt each spring by Abdol Hossein Dehqun’s tenants. (Dehqun, a Shiraz Bahu’i, is one of the main landowners of the area.) The produce of the area includes beet, rice, wheat and barley. Surplus crops are very large but the profit from these goes into the pockets of the landowners. The Nafar who are indifferent farmers live in very poor conditions which would be worse were it not for sales of produce from their flocks and herds. The stock-raising is a relic of what was once the mainstay of their economy. A number of the Rvmjerd Nafar join the Arab migration from the north to the south and take their flocks to Sarvestcn for the winters A track from Persepolis to Rumjerd, motorable in summer only gives access to this •ection of Nafar (see KHAMSEH-COMMUNICATIONS— (c) Settled Tribes—(m)^The Nafar of Rsmjerd are loosely bound under the supervision of Rahman who does not hold an official appointment as kalantar. His assistant is Afrusmb. The five sub-sections have no Jcadkhodas but come under the control of the man in charge' of the village in which they live. This man in charge is the agent of the Shiraz landlord who owns the village. Rahmun is the representative of Nafar and forwards complaints etc. to the Governor of Khamseh. The Nafar, both of Rumjerd and Lur, have a good reputation and appear to be on good terms with the neighbouring Persian villagers^ • A Nafar tribesman retains scarcely any Turkr facial features or characteristics of dress or way of life. He has intermingled thoroughly with his Persian neighbours and in appearance is practically indistinguishable from them. Nafar of Rumjerd total about 120 families (600 souls). They comprise 5 sub sections which are still distinct groups : Zamunkhuni, Bagdeli, Khoshnumi, Kirli- khuni and Shudi. SAHRy-YE ByGH SECTION The Sahru-ye B«gh district, lying in the mountains south-west of L&amp;r, is one of the most barren areas and possesses one of the most unpleasant climates of Ears. The land scarcely supports life and the 300 Nafar families living in the district exist rather than live. Very little agriculture is possible except in winter and the tribe engage principally in stock-raising. For this reason-they spend the summer wan dering among the foothills of the mountains to find grass for their sheep and goats. They penetrate the mountains 15-20 miles east and west of the Lur-Lengeh track. They are forced to buy much of their food from the Ler bazaar and meet such expenses with the profits gained from hiring out their camels and donkeys for transport of grain and other produce in the Lur area. Sahre-ye Bugh can be reached in a stout car by way of the abandoned motor track from Lur to Bastak and Lengeh. Nafar of Lur (the name usually given to this section) have no kafantar and their sub-sections have no official kadkhodas. A number of leading men represent their people when summoned by the Governor of Khamseh. These include Sard^r-e Dulikhuni, a retired thief. A few families of Nafar of Lur have taken themselves off to other parts of Lures- tun. The Qobutkhunlu group of Dulikhuni lives in the yb Rud Shur (Sab’eh) district south-east of Durub, wandering in the desert in search of grazing for their sheep and goats. They are notorious thieves and bandits. A few families of the Dulikhuni and Margemuri sub-sections are similarly occupied in the Juyom district. The activities of these small groups and such rogues as Sardcr-e Dulikhuni have given the Nafar of Lur a bad name which they do not deserve. In reality they are well- behaved. The Nafar of Lur also have lost all Turki characteristics. The Sahru-ye Bugh section of Nafar combined with the small groups in the Durub and Juyom districts total about 330 families. The total is made up as follows : Sub-section Lor Du'ikhvni .. Margemvri .. , * No. of families.

They are of Turki origin (Lak tribe) and are regarded by Noser Khan as true Qashqais. Until about 1865 they migrated from Durub to Semirom with the Qashqai. At that date the Governor-General of Ears had them separated from Qashqai and settled on their present lands under the control of his nephew, Mohammad Hossein Khan Qashqai. They still speak Turki. Seven Lashani sub-sections are settled in villages around ybedeh Tashk (UD40). They are the Bahmanvand, Najmodinvand, Abdollahvand, Yazdenvand, Elias- vand, Heidarvand and Morudvand. These sections number about 700 families! Five other sub-sections are settled in villages in the Khafrak district, east of Sa’odetabad (UC82). These are the Khalilvand, Shah vand, Bazvand, Kuhaki and Musa. This group now totals not more than 200 families. The ybadeh Tashk Lashanis were once among the most active and dangerous raiders of eastern Ears but seem to have become quieter since the South Persia Rifles subdued them in 1917. They are now poorly armed and commit only isolated thefts and acts of pilfery in their district. Unlike the Cheharrahi few of the Lashani live in tents and move in search of pasture during the summer. They have almost entirely lost their tribal organization and have no head men or chiefs. Physically and mentally the Lashani are above the average Persian standard They enjoy a fair degree of prosperity and their villages are well-built. Their dirty living conditions cause much trachoma and other contagious diseases. Malaria is very prevalent.

They live both in tents and in mud huts. Although not truly migratory they are conti nually on the move within their area in search of fresh pasture for their flocks A number of families move to the Pichakcn island in the Tashk salt lake in summer with their sheep and goats. - The Chehurruhis are notorious robbers. They operate principally on the Niriz- ybudeh Tashk and the Abarquh to Yezd roads. KaUmiars :—Qusem and Negahbun. Kadkhodas -Mokhtur. Abbas. Ali Khan and yqu Jan. QARyHI Another tribe of Turk origin, formerly independent, the Qarahi consists of the following sub-sections : Beig, Bayat, Damiri, Khalaj, Kari, Korrani, Ali Mardani and Bodaqi. These amount to 350 families. In addition the formerly independent tribe of Qaracheh is attached to Qarahi, bringing the total to 400 families Gara cheh also is a Turki tribe. ' * Qarahi are settled in the Sar Chahan district of Niriz approximately 50 miles north of Niriz village. The Qaracheh live at Quri (UK 1777). Neither group mig rates but they move from 10 to 15 miles each year for fresh grazing for their flocks They own their own land and the majority of the people are engaged in cultivation'.

The Doshmanziuri are not now regarded as a Mamassani sub-tribe. The origin of the Mamassani is obscure but all accounts agree that they came from the west and are mainly of Lor extraction. It is possible that they m the wake of the retreating Afghans before whom the original inhabitants of Shulesttm, as their area was then called, had fled. The Fehlitmis claim to have come originally from Jebel y’mal in the Hejcz. Formerly nomadic the Mamassanis have in the past 50 years built villages and become sedentarized. HISTORY Recent Mamassani history is closely bound up with the dispute regarding the ownership of the lands on which they live. Negotiations between the Bushin family and the Government for the settlement of this problem are in progress but an early solution is not to be expected. Details of the dispute are not given here.. During the past twenty years the Bakesh, Juvidi and Fehliuni sections have been comparatively well-behaved ; they ha've had only one minor clash with the government, in 1929, when part of the Bakesh disarmed the garrisons at Gardaneh Nulband and Nurubud. They assisted government forces in their struggle with the Boir Ahmadis and Rostamis in the late ‘ 20’s. On the other hand the Rostam section, probably as a result of their proximity to the Boir Ahmadi Sarhaddi and of intermarriage with that tribe, have been and continue to be a problem for the Gov ernment. Under Eimnn Qoli Khan Rostam they effectively opposed any attempt on the part of Hwji Mein et Tojjar Bushiri to collect revenue from the tribe. Early in 1922 Bushiri had a military force sent against Emum Qoli Khan but although they suffered casualties and wasted several months in the campaign the troops were unable to make any progress. After the strengthening of the military forces m 1923, summer, Emam Qoli consented to destroy his tov'ers, sent a small contingent to join the ‘military and professed obedience to the government. In 1929 he was defeated by General Habibollah Sheibuni and, fleeing under a guarantee of protection to Sardur As’ad*, was delivered by the latter to the govern ment who executed him a few years later. From 1934 onwards the leading khans m Mamassani were removed to Tehran or Shiraz where they were forced to remain either in prison or under observation until 1941 when they escaped and rejoined their tribe. Since his return Hossein Qoli Khan son of Emum Qoli has endeavoured to unite the jarring sections of Mamassani by marrying his sisters to the Juvidi and Bakesh Khans. He has also attempted to strengthen t he position of the Mamassani by playing off against each other the parties who have been competing for their co operation namely, the Government and the dissident tribes. The Government would like a united and docile Mamassani strongly opposed to the Boir Ahmadi and Qashcjai so as to be sure that the Qaslupii or Boir Ahmadi will not expand in their directions. On the other hand they are not prepared to strengthen the Mamassani in order to intimidate the other tribes as they fear the return of opposition to the Government in the tribe. They could easily win the support of the tribe by settling the Bushiri land dispute in the tribe’s favour but s how no s i ghs of d oing this. The tribe, o n the ’ *Cousiu of Mjrtoza QoliKhau Samsajn and Rcza Sh 'h ! a Minister of W ar.other hand, declare that they want no quarrel with the Government as they realise that rebel tribes such as the Qashqai must ultimately bow to the Government. They are far from satisfied with the Government over the settlement of the land question, the distribution of monopoly goods etc. This might be expected to lead to an alliance of Mamassani with other tribes against the Government but such an event is unlikely. The other tribes would like to gain Mamassani support, the Boir Ahmadi seem to have established friendly relations with Hossein Qoli Rostam who is the most important of the Mamassani Khans. Hossein Qoli may have a vague alliance with the Boir Ahmadi but he professes to desire the disarmament and submission of Boir Ahmadi and Qashqai alike. Relations between the Qashqai and Mamassani are strained ; the Qashqai would like to use the Mamassani lands in winter for grazing and wish to purchase property there for cultivation (Mamassani country is very fertile) ; they declare that they would not hesitate to walk in on Mamassani territory should it become necessary to take such drastic action ; they profess to regard the Mamassani tribesmen as easy prey. The Mamassani for their part have no intention of selling, hiring or ceding any land and say that they will have no difficulty in keeping the Qashqai out. It is improbable that the Qashqai will put their boast to the test. Hossein Qoli Khan who may see himself as a future Ilkhbni of Mamassani and who might try to bring other Mamassani sub-tribes besides his own (Rostam) into a tribal alliance against the Government, is the outstanding personality in Mamassani. TERRITORY 1. Position The Mamassani country lies between the Qashqai winter quarters around Gach Ssren to the south and west and the Boir Ahmadi to the north ; it consists of a series of valleys to the north and north-west of the Kuzerun plain. These valleys include the fertile Deh Nau, Telespid and Fehliun districts. The tribe is now almost complete ly non-nomadic and only a few sections are found in the Ardekun area during the summer when they take their flocks there. 2. BOUNDARIES (Maps : H39J Jun ’40 ; H39K, Jul ’41 ; H39P, ,Jun ’40; H39Q, Aug ’40. (These boundaries are not permanent : they have changed frequently in the past and may do so again in the future).

Point B3228 to 4507 (B32) thence to point B5023. (Padervz ia in Juvidi). 3. Physical The Mamassani territory consists of a series of valleys watered by three rivers, the Fehlitm, the Kati, and the yb Smh ; the first named is the same stream as the Shesh Pir which rises near Ardeknn and enters Mamassani through a narrow valley north of the Qal’eh Safid (B.32), crosses the territory in a westerly direction and leaves Mamassani south of Kuh-e-Mord (A. 83) as the Zohreh ri\er. The Kati, a tributary, waters the Nurubud plain ; the yb Siuh also joins the Zohreh, crossing the western end of the Deh Nau plain. It rises in the unmapped mountains north of Naugak (B. 15). Districts. (a) Ttostam alternates sharply between fertile plains and precipitous mountains* The several fertile districts—Barden gun, Telespid, Deh Nau, Naugrk, etc.—although on practically the same level are connected only by narrow gaps in the mountains. The valleys are thinly wooded except on the river near Bardengun (D1431) where the banks are closely grown with willow, oak, honor and tamarisk trees. There is an area of marsh land west of Mansun bud (B14). The plentiful water supply comes from the rivers Fehlien and yb Siuh (B04). The water of both these rivers is drinkable. (b) Bahesh is much more compact than Bostam, hung in one wide valley which runs from east to west. It is well populated and very fertile, watered by channels from the Doshmanziuri hills and by the river Kati (Katya Bud) which is used for drinking purposes. The approaches from the south-east are well wooded ; the western portion is sparsely wooded. Along the line of a stream that crosses the Shuhpur-Naubandegun (Nurubud) road there is a belt of thick scrub. (c) Jovidi is divided into two well-defined areas, the highlands in the east and the small fertile lowlands, about 4 miles square, in the west. The mountains are wooded with open grass land in the valleys between. Small mud villages are scattered about the upland valleys which extend westwards as far as the plateau edge, of which Qal'eh Safid (B32) is a part, and then drop abruptly to the river side plain. Of this latter the Juvidi possess only the small area to the immediate northwest of Qal’eh Safid. (d) Fehlion. is rectangular in shape, 8 miles long (north-west to south-east) and 4 miles wide, of which the village of Fehliun is the centre. It consists of a flat fertile plain which skirts the Fehliun river and slopes gradually up towards the hills in the south-west. On the plain there are a number of low outcrops on which villages are built; the foothills are wooded. The whole area is very well watered from the river Fehliun. Note.— In general the Mamassani valleys are well populated with small villages every few miles built around a slight eminence capped by a mud fort.160 The Deh Nan (Rostam) valley connecting Fehliun and Bnaht (A9348) provides the only easy alignment for a direct road linking Khuzestan and Ears ; at present flie detours via Gannveh on the coast and Khorram^b'ed in the north provide the only motorable connections between the two provinces. The construction of the direct route is essential for direct and close government control of the Qashqai and Boir Ahmadi tribes in the area. 4. Climate Climatic conditions vary considerably throughout Mamassani. In winter the valleys have a mild, damp climate and the north-eastern uplands, including the valley around Cheshmeh Safid are bitterly cold. In summer the lowlands are very hot and the abundance of water combined with the occasional summer rainfall give, these districts a high humidity. Malaria is very prevalent. The highland valleys are cool and healthy in summer. 5. Agriculture ^ * In Bakesh, Bostam and Fehlhm and to a lesser extent in the Jt?vidi lowland there is extensive cultivation. The yb Siah in the west, the Fehlitm and Kati river in the east and centre provide Mamassani with the best water supply of any area in Fars. Probably little more than one half of the available land is being used at present ; water is drawn from the rivers by channels and these are so frequent in the plain bordering the Fehlinn river that progress is impossible for motor trans port. The main crop of the area is rice, in a good year about 4,000 tons are available for export. Wheat, barley and maize are also extensively cultivated and 2,000 tons of wheat and 800 of barley are exported by the Mamassani in a good year. Several hundred tons of cotton are produced in Mamassani annually. Other crops are lentils, peas, beans and opTum. There is little fruit-growing. Sufficient oranges, lemons and dates are produced for local requirements. COMMUNICATIONS 1. External Access to Mamassani country is by the road Rezerun-Feklian, which is a three- hour journey in summer. The road surface is fair and could 'easily be improved. . The road is crossed by the Shuhpur river about 10 miles west of Kuzerun. This- crossing is quite impossible for motor transport after heavy rain and is passable for private cars only in late summer. From Nurubud (B3320) a motorable track leads to within 2 miles of Mollu Huji B’ebn and another leads from Buzeguh to Puderez (B32). The high land area to the east and all the lowlands are easily accessible by horse. The continuation of the Knzerun-Fehliun road as far as Bnsht is described in Appendix III. 2. Internal (Migration) A large section of the Juvidi highlanders who are sheep breeders move in summer to the Cheshmeh Scfid district; a number .remain to guard their villages. Their route leads through Pol-e Mord and the BoL uru pass (B5933). The shepherds of Rostam move to Sargah Chinch and those of Bakesh to Sh«h«n (16 miles from Almbnd (B71)) with their flocks in summer.161 Organization There is no appointment equivalent to the Qashqai lllhvni in Mamassani, but there is a civil Governor. Each of the four sub-tribes is controlled by a Kalantar who in normal times holds his appointment from the Governor-General of Ears. Owing however to the lack of Government control the danlars are independent and are appointed in hereditary succession or by the choice of the sub-tribe. The heads of the various sub-sections are appointed by the Kalantars and are responsible in all administrative matters {e.g., security, taxes, armed men, etc.), to them alone. ECONOMIC The bulk of the income of the Mamassani is derived from the sale of the surplus cereals crops—rice, wheat, barley, and maize (see AG1UCULTURE). The partly nomadic highlanders, Jevidi, sell the usual products of their flocks, wool, cooking fat, etc. Cotton also is a source of income. The main markets are Shiraz and Kezerun ; Ardekun is used by the Juvidi. There is a considerable barter trade with the neighbouring nomadic tribes and with Be slit. The Mamassani pay no taxes to the Government. Dues are paid on goods sold in market areas. A tax on a grain is paid by the peasants to the chief and the heads of sub-sections as follows ; Crop To Kalantar To Kadkhoda Rice .. half of crop .. one tenth of remainder. Wheat and barley .. .. 7$% of crop .. one tenth of remainder. In 1943 Mamassani livestock was much depleted by a disease called “ ranj ’* that killed off a great number of horses and mules. Those that survived are of a fairly high standard. The Mamassani employ the camels of neighbouring nomadic tribes for the transport of their goods. RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURS South .. Darrehshuri and Doshmanziuri. East .. Doshmanziuri and the inhabitants of the Homuij'en plain B73 who during the summer include the Kashkuli (Bozorg). North .. Boir Ahmadi Sarhaddi and, during the summer, Kashkuli (Bozorg)* West . .Buvi. Intermarriage with neighbouring tribes and a reputation of being able to defend their lands have ensured considerable security for the Mamassani. With the Doshmanzi'cri and the Buvi there is a close bond as these too are menaced by the nomadic tribes that surround them. Relations with the Qashqai Darrehshuri and Kashkuli are cool and all Qashqai is regarded with suspicion (see HISTORY). Despite marriage ties and a tradition of mutual assistance the Boir Ahmadi are re garded with distrust by the Rostam section who have in the last three years suffered much from their plundering and robbing. The majority of the Mamassani would like to see both the Boir Ahmadi and the Qashqai brought to heel by the Government but it would probably require a very attractive bait to induce them to take part in disarmament operations. They might however co-operate in the construction of the Fehlitm-Baskt road which would be a major step towards taming the Boir Ahmadi. THE PEOPLE The average Mamassani is of medium height, spare—except for those persona on whom the sedentary life is having its effect-with dark hair and eyes and in some cases an almost delicate complexion. Refined features are not uncommon. Despite162 settlement the Mamnssani rd;iiji their tribal costume to a great extent. This con sists of a round, often black, felt hat (in shape like that of the Qashqai without the brims) a light coloured robe and black trousers. The women wear small nose ornaments and have their brows tattooed. Settlement has made the majority of the Mamassani mean and ungenerous ; the khans are very wealthy by tribal standards but their conception of hospitality in most cases falls far below that of Qashqai. They are noted for sharp practices in commercial activities. General living conditions in Mamassani are slightly lower than those found in Qashqai but much better than those of Khamseh Arab. The khans are apparently miserly in their treatment of the people who are poorly dressed and housed. Polygamy is common throughout Mamassani and the women do not enjoy the independent and respected position of those in Qashqai. Opium-smoking is not uncommon. Health has apparently become worse since the settlement and malaria in particular is having a pronounced effect on the activities and appearance of the people. Of late venereal disease has appeared in the tribe. The religion of the people is Shi’ah Islam. The Mamassani are reputedly devout and harbour a great number of seyyeds and other “ holy men ”. The native language is Lori but Persian is spoken when required. STRENGTH The total number of Mamassani as given under ANALYSIS OF SUB-TRIBES is 8,070 families or approximately 32,0C0 souls. This is believed to be accurate. The fighting qualities of Mamassani have not been tried for many years. Their reputation for bravery and stamina is still quoted in Pars but it is probable that the effects of malaria and settlement have not increased the Mamassani’s desire or capacity for a fight. They profess to be prepared to deal with anyone who molests them and the fact that no-one has molested them in the past few years shows that they are still regarded with respect by their neighbours. Two or three thousand men is the maximum fighting force that could be expected of Mamassani; tha known number of their rifles is between one and two thousand. Ammunition appears to be plentiful. ANALYSIS OF SUB-TRIBES The following table gives details of sub-sections of each sub-tribe, the number of families and villages in each sub-section and the map reference of the central village belonging to each sub-section. The names of the heads—or leading personalities—in each sub-section are also given. ANALYSIS OF SUB SECTIONS—ROSTAM.168 APPENDIX I. PERSONALITIES. fl ossein Qoli Khan Rost am Bom 1908, Son of Emsm Qoli Khan who opposed Reza Shah and was executed in Tehran in 1936. About 1934 Hossein Qoli was taken to Tehran and from there to Tabriz where he was given inadequate land compensation. He returned in 1942 and set about forming a strong bloc from the hitherto disunited Mamassani sub tribes. He has marriage ties with the Bakesh and Jevidi sub-tribe# and is related to the Boir Ahmadi Sarhaddi and the Bevi. In the political field he is clever and wily and certainly the most astute and far-seeing of the Mamassani khans Although there arc signs that the khans of Bakesh and Juvidi are suspicious of his intentions his own tribes-people appear to like him. Hossein Qoli is of far from imposing presence ; he gives the impression of being a slippery, treacherous liar and reports confirm his reputation for double-dealing with the neighbouring nomads and the other Mamassani sub-tribes. He refuses to have any dealings with the Persian Government officials and so far his behaviour has given them no cause for interfering in his affairs. Ja'afar Qoli Khan Rostam Bom 1928. Son of Hossein Qoli Khan. Married 1945, Reputedly (tribal and outside sources) a very unpleasant, autocratic, cruel and conceited youth over whom his father has little control.

He still theoretically performs his duties. He is now joint Kalantar of Bakesh with . Mohammad Khan. He is a plausible and amusing rogue (not an unebmmon tribal type) who is reported to be selling the monopoly goods intended for the consump tion of his tribespeople. He is quite unreliable. One of his three wives is a sister of Hossein Qoli Khan. Khalil Khan Jtyvidi. Born 1898. Removed to Shiraz and imprisoned in 1938. Returned to the tribe in 1940. Now halantar of Juvidi Mnhur.

They^ were joined by sections of other Kuhgalu tribes which, owing to mi internal dissension, had left their own areas. The Original inhabitants of the wc territory now occupied by the Doshmanziurb-the Tir Merdon, Soltuni and Pavandeh in* tribes—were either dispersed or absorbed. th&lt; The Khans do not know how their name originated. a11 ' de' HISTORY. - Do The kalantars of the Doshmanziuri during the past 27 years have been as follows : 1918 Hassan Ali Khan&gt; 1918—1923 Soleimun Khan. • 1923—1930 yq'e Khan. 1930—1932 yqu Khan and Jehungir Khan. 1932—1945 yqu Khan and Ali Reze Khan (the latter not officially appointed). During the past thirty years Doshmanziuri history has been largely influenced by (i) a fear of Soulat ed Douleh (who did not endear himself to the tribe when he administered their lands on behalf of Heji Sa’id es Saltaneh (see HISTORICAL NOTE) and his off-spring and (ii) the usual antipathy between Lor and Turk. These fac tors, and possibly a desire on the part of the khans to be on the side that would ultimately be successful, induced them to support Qavam ul Hulk and the British Government in 1918 and later. They were actively engaged against Soulat ed Douleh and claim to have put 500 men into the struggle in 1918 and 1919. Following the Persian military operations against the rebel Mir Masku in Homuijun in 1923 Soleimun Khan who was then JcalantaT of Doshmanziuri was arrested and imprisoned for a few months for helping the rebel to escape. About •3932 there was domestic discord when yqu Khan and his brother Bubx? Khan forced Jehungir Khan, the Government nominee as joint Mantar, to leave Doshmanziuri but these appear to have been the only occasions on which the tribe has been at oJds with established authority. On the whole the Doshmanziari appear to have supported the Government satisfactorily having aided the Army during the operations against the Boir Ahmadi that began in 1928 and continued into 1929 and also during the Qashqai revolt that began in 1929 and continued into 1*930. During the later years of Pahlevi’s reign the Doshmanziuri suffered with the rest of the country at the hands of Government officials and the Gendarmerie. On the break-down of Government control after the fall of Reza Shah the Dosh- manzieri viewed with growing alarm the rapid recovery of the Qashqei fortunes and they did not hesitate in the early summer of 1943 to resist attempted depredations by the Qashqai Amaleh. A short engagement took place near Haraijun resulting in a few casualties on both sides. As a result they have been threatened with punish ment by Nuser Qashqai. , W 11611 Qavam ul Mulk returned to Fars as Governor-General in 1943 his pro mise of arms for use in support of the Government brought in a large number of Doshmanziuri tribesmen to Shiraz. Qavam’s failure, through no fault of his own, to implement his promise caused considerable resentment but the tribesmen re turned quietly to their homes. Do p Du the Do; hai wit the cer qai ha\ kha te: (Ma 1 run: the The Ard Bak 2. map chec Easl Nor Wes Soul. ^s^anziwi (and Mamassani) are jealous of Nuser Klian Qashqai and egard him wih dislike and distrust. With the Darrehshuri and Kashkuli or at least with the khans of these tribes, relations appear to have been cordial but the other Qashqai tribes are regarded with suspicion as being entirely pro-Nuser Khan. The fact that in the past year relations between Persian Government officials and the Qashqai khans have become close and even more the fact that Nuser Khan seems to ave he support of the British have occasioned alarm and despondency. This may be either jealousy oj a real fear that they may be thrown to the Qashqai wolves at some future date. The Doshmanmri khans lose no opportunity of point, ing out how thoroughly they have served the interests of the British by behaving themselves and supporting Qavam ul Mulk, the latter service being held as final and indisputable proof of pro-British sentiments. Yet, they complain, their devotion has brought them little profit since the Qashqai are supported and the Doshmanzian ignored by the British. 11 As noted under TEB'RITOKY--//is&lt;(&gt;r/c6t7 Note—the present landowner of Doshmanzmi, Hossem Dudgerr receives no income from this territory. In 1944 •b gerr s ogen &gt; r. A g nun Hekmat, proposed to rent the Doshmanziuri land to _ie vashkuh. (This may have been a threat in order to intimidate the khans of Doshmansnm). This proposal was fortunately abandoned as it would certainly have resulted in hostilities between Qashqai and Doshmanziuri. The khans of Doshmanziuri still hope a decision in their favour may be reache with regard to the ownership of all the Doshmanziuri lands. There are indications that the Qashqai have been playing with Doshmanziuri the game they have tried with Mamassani, creating internal dissension. It is un certain whether K user Khan is behind this but attempts have been made by the Qash qai to influence the appointment of khans in Doshmanziuri. In this they appear to have been successful and as a result relations between the various Doshmanziuri khans have become strained. TERRITORY.

The boundaries are approximately from point G4892 to and excluding Kuh-e Qandil (G39), to and including Emumzudeh (G3588) and thence back to point G4892. Amuyi and Galguni in this area were formerly part of Doshmanziuri. 3. Physical. Apart from the areas of yb Bunk, Rudbul and Chenur Shuh-e Jun, the territory of the Doshmanziuri lies almost entirely in a trough formed by mountain masses with an outlet towards the west where the river Shur enters Mamassani territory. The trough runs roughly from south-east to north-west and slopes slightly downwards in the same direction. The area is divided into two main sections by the river Shur and its tributary the Tavakollubcd which flow along the axis of the trough. The south-western section slopes upwards from the river to Kuh-e Nur and Kuh-e Tusak. The terrain is deeply scored by valleys running from sou ihnorth The middle slopes are wooded with oak and banak (a tree bearing edible nuts). The streams Deh Gerdu and Bure (or Bubui or Mashuyekh), both reported fresh, which flow together and are later joined by a salt water stream from further east, water the area. In the extreme south-eastern corner the trough gives place to a high plateau on which are several small lochs, reported fresh. The north-eastern area is bisected by the rivers Shur and Shesh Pir which, flow ing south from the direction of Ardeken, join in the Tang-e Budinn, and continuing due west meet the river Tavakollebud and the tributaries from the south-western section, the whole becoming the Biver Shur which enters Mamassani territory as the Biver Fehlnm. East of the Tang-e Budixm (a well defined feature, several hundreds of feet deep, with steep and at some points precipitous sides) the country rises almost to the eastern boundary. Kuh-e Goruh and Kuh-e Haraijcn, along the north-eastern boundary, drop towards the river Tavakollabad in a series of low hills and narrow valleys. West of the Tang-e Budiun there is a wide broken plain extending to the foot of Kuh-e Nive. Beyond are wooded slopes to the boundaries of Mamassani. All rivers and streams mentioned above are perennial. ' :iJ - Of the three areas outside the trough, yb Berik is a mile-wide plain with a few trees, lying between Kuh-e Esqaf-e Boland and Kuh-e Goruh, the former to the south west and the later to the north-east; Budbul, including Deh Bid and yb Garimii lying in the north-western corner of the Homeijen plain near the Shesh Pir river is an area of gently rolling hills and valleys, well watered by springs of which there are estimated to be fifty in the Budb'el district alone ; Chenur Shtfh-e Jim is a wide plain, tree-covered and rock strewn. The water supply from springs varies from year to year. ~ 4. Climate. •• With the exception of the Chemm Shuh-e Jim district which is extremely hot in summer, the climate is temperate throughout the greater part of the year. Dur ing an unusually severe winter snow may lie in the hills for six weeks but generally it disappears within a few days. The passes are rarely closed. The climate has been described as not unlike that of the Shiraz valley. Mosquitoes are rare except when the summer is hot and rainy (which occur* about once in five years).5. Agriculture. The main produce from the Doshmanisisri lands is the cereals crqp. A good year’s surplus may reach 1,000 tons of wheat and 50 tons of barley which is sold to 8hiraz. The tribe grows a very large quantity and variety of fruit: grapes, apples, peaches, pears and cherries, HISTORICAL NOTE. . • Fifty years ago the Doshmanziuri lands were crown property. About 1900 the lands were sold (toijul, the term used, actually means “ fief”) to Huji Sa’id es Saltaneh who, for a short period about 1911, farmed them out to Soulat ed Douleh. In 1917 Habibollah Khan Qavam ul Mulk (who died in 1916) purchased the lands from Sa’id es Saltaneh. In July 1931 they were officially registered in Qavam’a name. Friction arose between him and the khans on the question of ownership and as a gesture of goodwill and in order to maintain friendly relations, he returned, for a consideration, a portion of the lands in the north-eastern section, i.e., Deh Bid, Rudbel, Tang-e Rudien and Aliebcd, to Soleimen Khan and ybn Khan as repre sentatives of the other khans in 1932. At the same time he was obliged by Pahlevi to exchange the remainder of the lands for property in the north of Persia. Tho area thus once more became crown property and remained so until December 1937 when it was given to Hossein Dedgerr in exchange for lands in Mazandersn, the khans still retaining the north-eastern section which had been registered in their names. Thus the position remained in 1945 but Dedgerr, who was exiled by Rezu Shah in 1938 and was living in Paris, in 1915 was receiving no income from his land. COMMUNICATIONS. 1. External. With the exception of the road from Shahpur to Fehlien, which runs through- the Chener Sheh-e Jen district, and the road to Ardeken from Shiraz from which the north eastern boundary is not far distant, there are no motorable routes, in Doshmanzieri. 2. Internal, There is network of tracks- and paths, covering the Doshmanzieri hills and valleys, passable only for animals. See Appendix III for a report on the track from Sangar to Haraijen which is much easier going than the average track in Doshmanzieri. Note : Only 100 families of Doshmanzieri migrate and the route is not clearly defined (See PEOPLE). ORGANIZATION. Although the Doshmanzieri tribe is considered administratively—that is fof elections, military service, collection of cereals, etc.—as part of Mamassani it is in fact a separate entity. The tribes people refer to Mamassani and Do hmanzicri. The division of one from the other first occurred v/hen Sard es Saltaneh acquired the Doshmanzmri lands. Officially there is only one Kalanfar, yds Khan, but some of the tribe regard Ali Rezu Khan as joint kaJantar and ydc Khan appears to concede this position to him. Actually Bcbu Khan, younger brother of yds Khan, is the leading personality in the tribe. Jdfc&gt;7Anny180 Under these three leading khans the sub-tribes of Doshmanziuri are controlled by a series of heads whose appointments are largely hereditary. Nominally the chief of the tribe (Kalantar) submits the names of proposed heads of sub-tribes to the Shiraz Governorate for approval. In some cases the local military authorities demand the dismissal of an undesirable head. The Doshmanziuri have a good reputation for working with the local authorities with regard to these appointments. Frequent references have been made by the khans to British officials and officers to Qavam ul Mulk as leader of the Doshmanziuri. This is interpreted as an attempt on their part to’ please. ECONOMIC The tribe—or its khans—is a present quite comfortably off as no taxes are paid either to the landowner (Dedgerr) or to the Government. Officially the khans collect an annual tax of 7£% on wheat and barley and one tenth of the remainder goes to the sub-tribal head. Many of the khans refrain from exceeding this per centage, but others take everything they dare from their people. Conditions through out the tribe vary accordingly. There is no official capitation tax on livestock but presents are expected by the khans from owners of animals. The total estimated income for 1936 was 860,000 rials but in 1944 this figure had risen to 3,200,000 rials and it is believed to be increasing. The principal market centre, formerly Ardeken, has now shifted to Shiraz. The mail* sales are bf grape-juice or syrup, sheep (of which approximately 5,000 are sold each year), animal fats and other products from the herds and flocks, wheat and barley and the various fruits that grow on the land and are sold to the neighbouring villagers and to Shiraz (in the case of grapes). RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURS East : Settled villagers in Qahjt and yb Pardeh. Isorth . Settled vil'agers in the Homttijim plain ; a few families of Kashkuli Bozorg in summer; Jtjvidi Mamassani nomads. West : Jt.’vidi and Bakesh tribes of Mamassani. South : Settled villagers in Kuhmarreh. Relations with the settled villagers appear to be generally amicable although accusations are made against the Doshmanziuri of theft and cattle-stealing etc. Tms is no more than is to be expected in any settled Persian community. . ^ amassa ni and Doshmanziuri are apparently on completely amicable terms -n 11 ! anot While occasionally there is internal discord, the Mamassani an Dos imanzicri khans present a united front to the Government and to other tribes. There are many marriage ties between them. As a result of past raiding the Boir Ahmadi have not been popular with the os manziun but more recently there have been contacts between Doshmanzmi lans an Boir Ahmadi chiefs and relations seem to be becoming less strained. ty W their long-standing enmity with the Qashqai tribes, relations with the arre is uri an Ivashkuli (who migrate through Doshmanziuri territory) are cordial, ror details ol the Doshmanziuri attitude to Nsser Khan Qashqai see HISTORY.181 THE PEOPLE The Doshmanziwi is more sturdy, hardy and healthy than his neighbouring kinsman the Mamassani, thanks no doubt to the excellent climate be enjoys and the absence of malaria-carrying mosquitoes. The tribesman is generally of medium height and good build and has dark brown hair and eyes. The khans usually affect European clothing but the tribespeople generally wear tribal costume similar to that of Mamassani. This consists of the brown, brimless hat, light-coloured, ankle length robe bound with a great cummerbund stuffed with weapons and ammunition, dark trousers and cotton shoes. The women have their faces tattooed ; polygamy is rare. The Doshmanzicri are one of the settled tribes of Ears. Of their total only about 100 families migrate, moving in the spring from Chencr Shch-e Jen to the Haraijen area and returning in autumn. About 300 other families are entirely sedentary living in mud and stone-huts throughout the year ; the rest, by far the greatest number, spend the winter in their stone huts and in the summer move into tents in the immediate vicinity of their homes. In general they are clean in their way of life and their standard of health appears to be high. Malaria and trachoma are rare. Opium smoking is seldom seen. General conditions of life are better than in Mamassani and compare favour able with those of the prosperous sections of Qashqai. The people are of Shi’ah persuasion but they are reported to be the least religiously inclined of all the tribes of Ears. The Doshmanziuri is reputed to be a good fighter. STRENGTH There are 1,885 families in Doshmanzicri. With this total it is estimated that they could provide 1,000 fighting men. There are 90 good government rifles in the possession of the tribe and if is estimated that they hold 100 others of mixed modern and ancient manufacture. Ammunition is plentiful.

Calls himself the farrashbas. % (head servant or steward) of the 1 )oshmanzii3ri, but there is little doubt that he is actually the most powerful and in fluential figure within the tribe. He professes a disinterested friendship for the British Government but as he has the reputation of being a smooth and clever intriguer it would be unwise to place too much reliance on him. He is accused with his brother yq'e Khan, of condoning cattle-lifting etc. by his tribesmen. Ali Rezv Khan. —Born 1915. Eldest son of a former kalantar, Hassan AH Khan, was appointed joint halantar with yq'eKhan in 1941 on the representations of one section of Doshmanziuri. This appears to be a domestic arrangement only and the Government departments recognize only yqu Khan. Ali Rezu is a person able young man but he does not appear to have much influence in the tribe. J ehvngir Khan. —Bom 1887. About 1911 he was Jcalanlar of the tribe during the period when Soulat ed Douleh was farming the lands on behalf of Sa’id es Saltaneh. He held this appointment for less than one year. Later he entered the service of Qavam ul Mulk. About 1930 he was appointed joint Jcalantar with yqu Khdn by the military authorities and he remained such for approximately two years. He was then forcibly expelled from Doshmanziuri by armed men under his cousins yqu Khan and Bvbv Khan. He appears to be on superficially amicable terms with these «khans. A rat-faced, small and pleasant man. Has now little influence in the tribe but is generally well regarded. Smokes opium. Mohammad Qoli Khan. —Born 1917. Educated in Shiraz. Was employed in the Food Department there from 1941 to 1944. He now appears to have settled down with the tribe. A pleasant youth.MS 7 Army 188 (too) 187 APPENDIX III—ROUTE REPORT SANGAR (B8814) TO HARATJyN (B7817). Distance: 6*5 miles. Map: H39K. Jul’41 Remarks. Track throughout is fit for pack transport only.
