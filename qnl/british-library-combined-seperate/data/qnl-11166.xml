The report concerns British interests in Persia and the recent formation of the South Persia Military Police (abbreviated to SPMP in this file and later known as the South Persia Rifles).The report begins with a brief summary of the events leading up to the present situation, before summarising both the Russian and the British position in Persia. The report describes the circumstances in which the SPMP was formed, and then goes on to provide suggestions for how the force should be organised and distributed. Steel advises that the force embrace the whole of the so-called neutral sphere, and also suggests that it would be 'sheer folly to economize in the number of British officers employed.'The report is followed by two appendices. The first appendix, dated 19 June 1916 and also written by Steel, provides available information regarding the SPMP, including its objectives, details of its personnel, and its financial details (Steel anticipates that half of its expenses will be borne by the Government of India and the other half by the Imperial Government).The second appendix, dated 12 April 1914 and also attributed to Steel, is an abstract of the budget of the Government Gendarmerie, Persia, for 1914-1915. This appendix has two appendices of its own: the first is a summary of Gendarmerie forces as proposed in the preceding budget; the second appendix provides details of the pay of Persian ranks and of the initial cost and upkeep of horses, uniform, equipment and saddlery.A third appendix to the initial report is listed in the contents; however, this appendix has been transferred to another file.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>South Persia Rifles</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Richard Alexander Steel</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military operations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Armed forces</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000162#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
