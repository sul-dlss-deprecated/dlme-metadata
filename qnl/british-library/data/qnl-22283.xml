Ho. D/0. • • • January 11th 1933o Dear Colonel Loch* _ _ . _ . . . n . It may seem rather premature but I think it is almost time to consider what arrangements are to be made for a substitute for myself when I go on leave in the summer of 1934; ± shall be taking six months leave, probably from April or thereabouts. Before this year there has been iO difficulty as Captain Parke who was Assistant Adviser and Police-Officer used to act for me during my absence, but now we have no Police Officer and I do not consider that de Grenier is qualified to cope with my work. When the matter was originally discussed it was hoped that by 1934 financial conditions would have improved sufficiently for the State to engage another Police Officer who would also do court work and act for me when I was away. This at present cannot be afforded though it is just possible that if the oil company uegm making payments we might be more prosperous in a year s time. Tne other suggestion is that we should obtain the services of someone for six months, but if this were done it would be necessary for the man to be here for several months beforehand in order , get acquainted with the work. de Grenier is due to go on leave this summer but Steele is for leave in 1934 so a temporary substitute will have to t 8 ?ound for hirthis I hope to beetle to arrange ^allenders. Unfortunately all this will cost money so 1934 will be an expensive year for the State. This summer while de Grenier is away I St-ctnn^o^^rdlS ior^r^nSt ^f^f ^e ?heth?ee jobs at once. It is a great deal more than one person can do, especially in the summer, but for financial reasons it is inevitable and I fully appreciate this. What is really needed, when conditions improve, is a young man who would do the work which Parke used to do and more than tha. a., well • At present, although owing to lack of '^iou'ture'ltc 0 special work such as land surT ^• P^^^work which l should deal ^rro^fs^vf^^nririLr^ficerf' 5 the Police w „ , i ^ 0 4 . reauire mueh more attention than before breakfast and the} rea -} q hv the court, and 4 -vot Whole mornings every week are taken up by tne cuu xv, bbe amount'of tion seem^to^inceease^yearly. -othermor^ S every fortnight by affairs of the Wakf -^epartment^and at present^! without^ attending to them.

Mr.BELGRAVE doubted very much the ability of Mr.de GRENIER to perform many of the Adviser^ jobs - especially those related to the Private Purse and arrangements of the Ruler. 4. He agreed it was a difficult matter. 5. 1934:Would be very expensive for the State as both he and Mr.STEELE (State Engineer) were due long leave. 6. For Mr.STEELE he hoped that a temporary Engineer would be obtained through Messrs Callender and Company (erectors of the Power Plant),but that would be expensive. — - — — wouldn’t accept a temporary job,and there appeared no prospects of getting an Assistant Adviser and Police Officer at the present time of financial stringency. 8.

Mr I make the following suggestions for dividing up my duties v.nen I am on leave next summer. I should like if possible to get away early in April and to return in October. 2. Finances. The Budget for 1353 vail be prepared by me and approved by Shaikh Earned before I leave, ^ will also prepare the Annual KeiO^u. Current monthly payments such as salaries, Civil -^ist, municipal and Education allowances will be paid automatically as usual oy B ik, C ;her payments such as Police, deparrmeur 1 staffs etc; will be made strictly according to the State Budget and the various separate budgets which are prep, red for each department. de Grenier will be authorised to make all necessary payments, which are usually made by cheque, according to the Budget, ne wi-'.l operate on the Consolidated Fund and tne Deposit Account, no will also supervise the accounts in my office and submit the monthly returns to you. I suggest that during my absence tne returns should be oent to you monthly, not every three months ts* present, so that you will constantly be aware of the financial position of the State. I t. ink ost likely, in s ite of the anaiti-nal nontah, revenue from the oil Co.pony, that there will De very little margin next year betw een the Revenue and the Expedditure, v.nici. is pea.n.ps all for the best. Payments of royalty under the oil concession are payable half yearly so any royalty on the oil which may be shipped in July will not be reci/eved until after my return, l The State's reserve is on fixed deposit in Bombay ana I will arrange to re-invest the one amount of this sum which is due to fall due while I am away before I leave, otherwise it might be suggested that this money should be spent,which as things are now 1 think would be unwise. We s,re not sure of a certain income from the oil royalty after July although it seems to be probable.(. 2 .) Protection, Police and Mature. &lt;$&gt; &lt; 'fas&amp;zfrr 2. TI:e Police Ofiicer, Haj i SuLean, v/ill ee in covua.and of the Police under the direct orders of Shaikh ilaiaed. Tixe Police are a ne\^l/ formed force and I feel myself tnat they need constant attention. If they are allowed to jet slack will take time to brinj them up to the ,iark ajain. Though Shaikh Earned is interested in them he does not in the least appreciate the importance art oa t strictness and discipline and attention to details* If you could occasionally have a look a,t them when they are on parade and also mention any cases of slackness or Dad conduct which you miyht happen to notice iiojeusi to Haji Suhnan it would be a great help. iSji Sula n will also be in cl-arge of the jail vn.ich contains f0rCic;n SS 011 a8 ' Bahrain Prisoners.

It 1 ^ m my opinion an extremly important brand, of the- acmimstration and one which is liable to fro- „Pn + aD - Le 1,0 irequent pressure by persons, usually members of the Ruling Family, who wish to upset former registrations or to register property illegally. Tne slightest deviation from the lane regulations, which are very well known, is * Uaule to injure the whole land registration system.

I am arranging for a temporary substitute from Callenders Cable Coy: Education. 7.. Si milch Abdulla, as minister of Education, will be responsible for the schools, the practical work of inspecting and managing them will as usual be done by the Inspector of Education, j*-r Auham. If j ou could occasionally walk through one of the schools it would be helpful. 8. Judicial. Slmilch Sulman will sit in the Bahrain Court and I shall suggest thci.t one Ox his relations should sit with him. He is fully capable 01 t]le work. I think it would he inadvisable to auk Si-aikh Konaramed or Abdulla to sit with him as that would mean that he would automatically lave to concur with his older relation’s opinion. It would be better if a junior member of the family sat with him. 3. In case of important financial, oil or political matters I suggest that Shaikh Hamed should be informed and asked to discuss t;_e matter with his brother* and Shaikh Sulman. Wi s is the present &gt;(.4.) @ n practice and works very successfully. 10. Shai kl * Kc .me d8 s mo n ey affairs. At present I deal with all Shaikh that ky the time I on leave he will ago he owed nearly Rs 40,000/- hut this off. If he would like de Grenier to as do so otherwise lie will have to manage Hamed's money affairs. I hope he out of dept, -about six months amount is gradually being paid sist him in this matter i.e caii his own affairs vn.ile I am on leave. I fear in that case that it is likely that he will run into debt again, as usual. 11. In matters concerning customs, Landing Company shipping etc etc I suggest tlxat de Grenier should he consulted. He is well experienced in these matters. 12 . The possibilities which I am afraid of are, an attack on the Reserve Fund, attempts to increase the Civil List by reducing other expenses sucA. as Education, -^uiiicipalities Police etc etc,scad, in order to add to some of the present salaries, pressure being brought on the Land Department in such questions as the hhalifah ' hibas the Meglis Tajara in cases against divers liable to imagine that difficulties will ”, and unfair decisions by .

He aoes not want Belgrave to leave before that day,which will probably be the 30th January v the Shaikh seems to be keeping the date by the arable month;,as there is a good deal to be arranged. The Shaikh appeared to attach considerable store to Belgrave’s remain ing, though he lelt diffident in upsetting a first visit to Bushire in this way. in all the circumstances Belgrave thinks,and 1 agree,that it would be better to put the visit oil,if you do not mind. 2. I do not know if you would think ot apking him after tne anniversary ceremony but a further complication arises. The ersian Legation have given Belgrave a document for entry into 'ersia,which is valid only until the 10th February,so that the only chance Belgrave would have of travelling on that document would be if he were to go over by the mail leaving here on the 4th or bth February. 3.

Lieutenant-Colonel E.L.Meadlecott.,L.S.O.,GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. Dear Colonel Loch, With reference toBTfecent conversation with you and with Colonel Fowle regarding the terms of my agreement, it was suggested I think that I should write to you on the suoject. my work and living conditions in Bahrain have changed very much with it far more work and greater responsibility than was ever in customs duties has also contributed towards higher cost of living ’ about three years ago, on my own suggestion, my p-y - 3 ca ^ IO/o. At that time there was no sure prospect of revenue from oil and owing to the financial position of the state an all x’ound the reduction but this was of course impossible. 3. In my agreement it is provided that I receive an annual increment of Rs 50/- per month rising to a maximum of Rs 2200/- per month. It would take me about another twenty years service to reach this maximum, continuous service in Bahrain for such a number of years is inconceivable especially as when I came here I had already had over eleven years in the East in military and administrative posts. I ask for an increase of Rs 200/- per month on iny present pay. 4. According to my leave terms I am entitled to take home leave after every two years service, actually, in order to avoid the hot weather in Bahrain I take home leave after every two and a half years service, which is a long time to spend in Bahrain v*nen normally I never leave the island for a single day during my term of service. Once, after every four years service,! receive passages for myself and my wife, the alternate leave I pay my own passage. Since I came here, nearly nine years ago, the nature of Especially during the last two years the advent of oil has brought anticipated when I was engaged. Owing to the influx of SMropeans the cost of living, servants wages etc, has risen and the increase reduction was necessary. Shaikh Hamel washed to exempt me fromGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. I am allowed however to utilise the one return fare to India which I am granted in years when I do not go home, 5. The original leave provisions are not suitable to present conditions. It is difficult and inconvenient to take the month’s local leave every year,the journey, in the middle of the summer, to a place where one would benefit from a change of air is a deterrent to taking short leave. Travel facilities have improved greatly during recent years; England can be reached in a few days by air or in a fortnight by land. The bad effect of a prolonged stay in Bahrain and the dislocation in work resulting from six months leave could be obviated by shorter out more frequent leave, such as is given to officers in the Colonial service and, I believe, the Consular service.I ask for four months leave, excluding time taken to make the journey by air, with return air fare and half fare for my wife, if making the journey, every second year. 6. The only form of pension which I have is the Provident Fund. This fund is invested in British Government stock. There has been a great drop in interest rates since this fund was conceived and it now produces very much less than it did previously. I usx for an additional Rs 50/- per month to be added to the present Provident Fund to counteract the effect of the reduction in rates of interest.

Touis sinceiely&gt; Would you be so kind as to let me have your reply to the points raised in this Office letter of the 8th December 1 1934* regarding Pr otest of Bills.I enclose a copy of a demi-officijrL letter dated the 18th I'eceml^er 1934 from Beigrave about the proposed improvement in his terms of service, v.hich we discussed during your recent visit to Bahrain* 7 *. Y.e agreed that the conditions of ^ .grave’s a. pointment have so changed and the responsibility so increased that an improvement is fair* In vie* of the signing of the lining uease it is reasonable to think that the Btete will be able to bear the cost* 3* Beigrave asks for improvement in (a) his pay, (b) his passage concession, and (c) his x-revident *und. 4. After discussion we agreed on the following views:- (i) That an improvement in the Provident Fund on the ground put forward by Beigrave would be difficult to support and would be likely to give rise to similar demands from else where which it would be hard to resist: it was therefore decided to recommend an improvement only in the form of pay. (ii) That the proposed improvement in the Passage Concession can be made with the result of a small saving to the Itate and can be recommended in the best interests both of the btate and of the individual. (iii) That it was undesirable to give the proposed im. rovement In pay in the form of an immediate increase of Hs*500/- a month as to do so might ^ive an handle po propaganda against the Adviser; and that the improvement had betier be given by making the increment in his time scale (at present y.800-50-^OO) -.100/- with effect from the increment aue at the beginning of this (Arabic) year. This proposal has the further advantage of giving a benefit v.hich increases as (it is to be hoped) the oil royalties increase* /(iv). The Honourable hieutemnt-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B*E*, Political ^siaent in the Persian ^uif, Bushire*(iv) That if the pay of the appointment of Adviser were to be raised, it would be inadvisable to create a post of Assistant to the Adviser and that, as Mr* Luard is not available, the proposal should be dropped and an attempt be iiade to place responsibility for some of the work now done by the Adviser on to others and to add to his higher clerical staff. 5 . ?ax. i enclose a statement ’A 1 showing the effect 6t the ini 4 rovement in pay (i) as proposed by heigrave, end (ii) as it will be if the inerruent is increased and the Provident Fund proposal dropped. It will be seen that on the assumption that Belgrave will serve for another ten years, the latter will give him *.1615/- more than his own proposal, but is not so beneficial in the earlier years, it, however, avoids the sudden increase at the beginning before the fuxi effect of oil development is felt. Beigrave accepts the change. Passage^ . I also attach a statement ‘B* showing tne cost to the State of allowing Belgrave to go home for four months and ten days (the time of air passage there end back) every second year, with half a far for his wife. There is a slight saving of money to the State. 7* I recommend tnat tne Political Agent should be authorized to place the matter before the Shaikh. x should be grateful If ti bles could be checked through, though I think that the&gt; are correct.Statement *3” Adviser.

He assures me, and of course there is no doubt about it, that the letter was written entirely without hie knowledge or sug estion and that when he himself received it he saw Bis Highness and told him he was very grateful for His Highness 1 appreciation but that his pay was according to his agreement and he had no complaint about it. In fact he said to Kis Highness that if he cared to write saying that he was satisfied with Belgrave's services he, Belgrave, would be equally grateful, but His Highness was not prepared to with draw the present letter. As Belgrave f ound that His Highness had discussed the matter with the other Shaikhs and had even written to young Shaikh Abdullah in England telling him about it, he decided that he should no longer v/ithhold this letter and so has now sent it to me. 3* Belgrave * s character is so well-known that it was un necessary for him, except for his own satisfaction, to trouble to assure us that Kis Highness* action had not beetv prompted or in any way suggested by himself. .e Lieutenant-Colonel tchard Foy*'3 e, K.C.C.B.h!*, .itic&amp;l resident in the Persian Gulf, Bu shire*4. As a result of the 1935 correspondence (vide Loch's demi-official letter Ko.

He has of course certain other privileges in addition to his pay, hut it can safely be said that he is far from being overpaid for the very excellent work that he does here. I feel that His Highness would think it very strange if we resisted the suggestion that he has made, and I think that it will satisfy everyone if Belgrave were given one year 1 s advance increment. I have carefully refrained from asking His Highness to express a view on the amount he would like to increase Belgrave's pay as I am sure it will be not less but/much more than an extra T\3m 100/- a month and it would obviate difficulties if the were actual figure kfc fixed or at any rate suggested by us. probably Yours sincerely.The Adviser to the Bahrain Government presents his compliments to : His Britannic Lajesty f s Political xigent, Bahrain. and has the honour to send him a copy of undermentioned documents.

They have now decided to go, at any rate, to Karachi for the whole of September and possibly half of Cctober. It is not possible for him to go earlier as deOrenier has to take his furlough first. 4.

C/351 dated 21st April 1941, I find that my agreement has not been renewed since 1929. I had no copy of His Highness’s letter to the Political Agent regarding the renewal then. I have explained the position to His Highness and he has approved of a further renewal for four years from 15th Rabi al Thany 1360. Yours sincerely, • &gt; Major R.G.E.W.

At the time there had been a suggestion to insert an amendment with the object of making the contract one of Indeterminate duration. This ^jroposal was however dropped, vide letter D 1243-N/33 dated 3Cth March 1933 from the Deputy Secretary, Foreign and Political Depart ment, to the Hon*ble the Political Resident* 2. I asked Belgrave whether he knew of any reason why his contract had not been renewed since the files are silent on this point. Belgr^ve, on the strength of this, went to the .Shaikh and got him to write to me saying that The Hon’ble Lieutenant Colonel he /- C. G. Prior, C.I.I2., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushirehe had renewed the contrast and hoped that this would be approved. Bel^rave explains that the renewal is for four years and dates froc the 15th Kabi al Than! 1360, i.e., 11th May 1941. 3* i do not know whether you wish any action to be taken in the matter; it seems rather odd to renew a con tract after a lapse of over seven years* 4* Helgrave is now drawing Fts.1900 per month in the scale Re* 12C0 - 100 ** di200 and will reach the maximum in 1944* In addition to this he draws its*200 per month for acting as Commandant of Police, which makes his pay up to Rs* 2,100 per month at the present moment, after 15 years service with the State. 5. In looking through Belgravt^s file, I see that there is a confidential D.O. No.0/344 dated 20th June 1938 from Sir Trenchard to Vreightman suggesting that he should approach the Shaikh with a view to giving Belgrave an advance increment. For one reason or another no action appears to have been taken on this letter, but if you wish the matter taken up I will do so. I think hov/ever that he is not doing badly and that the present pay is sufficient for the post.

Your Excellency, J We the Bahrain population have the honour to put the following petition to your honour requesting you to be kind enough to.study it carefully and give it the necessary attention* 'of Bahrain have become under the kind protection of the Great Britain and we have enjoyed the kind control and organisation of all your officials without any exceptions, but an idea was created ~ ' twenty five years ago that we should have a financial adviser to ^ ' which we were thankful at the begining and would have remained so had it not been that we were so unlucky to get the wrong type of man to maintain this post.

Since about ten years this gentleman has declared his dectatorship over Bahrain apd Ignored every one on these Islands inclyding our Shaikhs and most of the Political Agents also unless they are exceptionally outstanding figures. Bahrain Government and American Oil Company, this man took the liberty without consulting either the local authorities nor the public representatives and limited the wages of Bahrain employees in each categary no matter what their capability ofc ability may be they should not exceed that limit* People brought from abroad for the same job receive twice or even more that a Bahraini and bothe persons work in the same post and under the same roof. Lately this gehtleman to give Bahrain Petroleum Company as much help as he can he stopped Bahrainis from leaving to Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar Peninsular etc. where they get much more pay and canc- ^X^blled all the Passports previously issued.

Below we enumerate the the posts at present are occupied by either British or Indan Officials in Bahrain, but only namely as they cannot do any single thing in their own Jobs whatever their experience is. It might not be believed when we state that he even interferes in Doctors directorship of hospitals etc. causing one of the best British Doctors we ever had Dr.Jhons to resignet 1. Finance (his own no doubt) 2. Director of Customs &amp; Port Officer. 3. Education Director. 4. Commandant State Police. 5. State Medical Officer. 6. General Chairman of Municipalities (Moharraq &amp; Manamah) 7. The Head Judge of the Law Courts. 8. The Head Judge of Criminal Courts. 9. State Engineer. 10. Passport Officer. 11. Superintendent Public Works. It is now nearly two centuries since the Islands Adviser On the occasion of conducting the agreement between This man has utilised the weakness of our presentEDUCATION. This is no doubt the most Important subject as it/misman agement does not only effect the present t but extends it mischief to the future generations* This institution was founded in Bahrain 28 years ago and was managed and financed by a group of wealthy merchants of Bahrain and things were going in the right direction. Mr.Belgrave did not like such an institute quite separated from his own personal influence and Immediately took steps dissolving that committee* 'taking over the funds and started from the begining* Certainly he ruined the whole system. Had it not been for the kind attention of the Political Agent,the Honble. Political Resident and the BrIrtish Council in Cairo - we would had no schools by now on the Islands. Mr. J.P.Wakelin was appointed by the British Council as /—^iducation Director, Bahrain. This certainly was a nice blow to Mr. Jelgrave’s influence. Mr.wakelin adopted new Education methods on the most modern system and brought Egyptian teachers and conditions improved nicely, but on the long mm the Adviser started puting obs- tiolea in Mr.Wakelin*s way, sometimes creating financial excuses, other limiting Mr.Wakelin 1 s luotures and speaohes in the schools until he was so annoyed and was compelled to resign. We feel sure that the . Political Agents files have got a great deal to say on this point. So we lost another most capable man as a victim of Mr.Belgrave 1 s egoism. We all think that if this man remains in power there will come a day when w© will find ourselves going back to the middle ages. We perfectly know that the Croat Britain is one of the leading, if not the leading, nations to encourage education and spread the knowledge amongst every people they came in contact with, but unfortunatley, we have been treated by this man otherwise. COURTS. It cannot be imagined that a country existing in the Both century and has an important wordly situation such as Bahrain has got no Law of its own. It is still difficult to realise that this man took office in 1921 and since became the main source of regulation and never thought of compiling a law to enable the citizen to know the right and avoid the wrong. We admit that we must compile our own laws, but that if we were left free of his misruling and deota- torship. In the past we use to have one court only and that is ”SHARA n based mainly on the holy 'QURAN' which most of the Moslems learn by heart. So the faults are quite obvious and avoidable, but after this man has established several courts appointing himself as the head judge of them all, things became so complicated and vague. Moreover he had appointed as assistants judges some youths of the ^^ling family, who are not only lacking education and illitrated, wut have got not the slightest idea of courts or any amount of life experience and no doubt your honour will be surprised to know that all these hardly can sign their own names correctly. In the hands of these Ignorant lots of young shaikhs are the lives, the wealth and the interest of the Bahrain population is lying* Doubtless you find several oases of the same nature and same circumstances, but diff erent judgement. This dependes mainly how one of the parties is related, or friend of one of those occupying the Court Chair. Relationship, friendship etc. play the most important part on this stage. No matter how the proofs may be clear and genuine, one must suffer when those elements are against him. We could very easily give several examples on this subject, but not to waste your honour’s time, we will only mention one. Two persons were accused of drinking liquor,-which Belgrave made one of the most serious crimes- they were tried, one of the was sentenced six months vigorous imprisonment, which- is correct in accordance with the prevailing law found for this purp ose, while the other one who enjoys the friendship of an authority and serves in an important department, was fined Rs.1000/- and set free. It must be clear that the one got the imprisonment is quite wealthy and runs a well known firm in the country. So it is clear that the country is left wit out a law so as to enable Mr .Belgrave PAGE No.2. n ^ &amp;PAGE W0«3« and his aohool to satisfy tholr own feelings when a caught t by varying their law there and then on spot the present demand* POLIOS COMMANDANT * As a polloe oommand&amp;nt Mr*Belgrave has to show his influence and overrule* Among the most orders he had made as a rule, the searching of every Bahrainis house at any time a policeman wishes without any warning or searcn warrant. This is only to please the Shaikh Mr* Bale grave pretending to be one of the most careful Moslems wanting to erradicate the habit of drinking from Bahrain* It so happened on several occasions when children lost their lives as the police carried out a surprise attack on certain houses during late hours at night* hunting for liquors* Because of the kind control of the Political Agent here the foreigners do not suffer from such an attitude* A search warrant k must be obtained from the Political Agenc* before any house can be raided and that warrant is not issued, but after careful study of the matter and the importance attached to it* Prom this your honour can imagine our state of affairs and that we are not even left free in our own houses and we have no personal liberty at all* The other appearance of savageness Is the whipping of those who play gambling 'publicly in the 'Wednesday' basaar' a sort of punishment used in the Middle Ages and still Mr*Belgrave the modern man applies it here in the 20th century. Certainly he finds several excuses by throwing such a blame on the Shaikh* shoulders, but this is not true as tne does not approve of such a thing and if he does he must be taught better* We think that your hnour now have a clear picture of the conditions in Bahrain, so we request the Great Britain to change this man and send to us a true type of Englishman who has wider knowledge and can handle things in a better manner* Following are our immediate requests without which we cannot be any better*- 1* Releasing the present adviser and appointing another one limited to his own sphere* 2* Appointing a capable Education Director and setting his hands free to fulfil his own responsibilities* 3, The Present State Engineer is the right person required for Bahrain, but should be given fuller authority to handle his own Job without interfere nce of others* 4* Forming of a Legislative Committee to compile a a Law for Bahrain and remain In power to super vise the interior affairs and organisation* 6* Forming of a labour Committee to safeguard the interests of the labourers on the Islands* We attach the greatest of hope on your hnour 1 s help and assistance over these points as all of these ore quite essen tial for Bahrain at present and we will be very grateful and most thankful to you and to the British Government* Certainly removing of this man will smooth things nicely as Bahrain had sufferred quite long enough during his office* victim is to cover a vast field disgusting We have the hnour to be sir.

Dear Colonel Galloway, Will you please refer to your memorandum No.1413-3, dated the 30th July, 1947, regarding petition dated 21st July, 1947, from ’’Bahrain Island Population'’ to the Minister of Colonies, London. 2. I am afraid I have not been able to discover who are the authors of this petition, but my comments on it are as follows (a) General Administration . There is no doubt that Belgrave has over- cencralised control of the 3'-ate administra tion in his own hands, and abstains as far as possible from delegating any responsibility for decisions, financial or otherwise, to the various heads of departments. (b) Education . Belgrave has done little to influence His Highness to agree to the appointment of a new British Director of Education, vide Felly's demi-official letter No.c/754, dated the 29th of June, 1947, to you, and demi-official letter No.C/453, dated the 10th April, 1947, to Pettigrew. , &gt; ^ ( c ) Administration of Justice . •» j / £ The codification of the Bahrain State Laws remains uncompleted. (In this connection please see paragraph 6 of Sir Geoffrey prior’s 'Note on Discussions with Mr. Belgrave' dated the 16th March, 1946). ^ My own experience of the judicial work of r -' /| the members of the Ruling Family is con fined to that of Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad, in the Junior Joint Court. His services there are adequate, perhaps because he rarely expresses an original opinion. (d) Police . It was in 1332 that Belgrave first assumed, /in addition The Hon’ble Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway, C. I. E., 0.B.iii., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN .in addition to his own duties, those of the Commandant of police on the retire ment of Captain Parke who had until then been Assistant Adviser and police Officer. The separate post of police Commandant was then 'temporarily'* retrenched on the grounds of financial stringency. It has since become merged with that of the Adviser, although even in the very beginning, in a D/0. C.85, dated the 11th January, 1933, to • Colonel Loch dealing with this question, Bdgrave admitted that he could not really afford the necessary time for the work which he had to do in connection with the police in addition to his own ordinary duties, in spite of this, however, Belgrave has clung tightly to the position of Commandant of Police from then until now, and has resisted any suggestion that he should relinquish it. There is no doubt, however, that the Bahrain Police Force has long needed a regular Police Officer to command the State Police, and it seems to me that at the present time when many experienced officers of the Indian police are leaving India it should be possible to recruit a suitable man for the post. The Police Force as it stands is, with the exception of the British Section, inefficient and corrupt, and lacks any proper system of organisation and training. ) I do not favour the appointment of either Legislative or Labour Committees in Bahrain, at the present time.

The facts are sufficiently well known and corroboration from anonymous petitions (of which I believe there is yet another one in circulation) is not necessary. It is natural that the Shaikh should want to keep from us the details of a criticism which reflects on his administration and I think we should respect that, as the matter is mainly an internal one. To press Smith may embarrass him vis-a-vis the Shaikh, and you need not ask him to implement the promise you mention in paragraph 5 of your letter under reference. 4.

The complaints against the Acting Adviser were not so much complaints against Graith per sonally as a general complaint against the policy of controlling prices in Bahrain. Smith’s name was mentioned because he administers the controls. 3. His Highness the Shaikh has since received a deputation of merchants to discuss the removal of price controls and has forwarded certain recommendations to me. My comments on them will follow as soon as I have had a chance to examine in detail their possible effect on the cost of living in Bahrain. yours sincerely, The Hon*ble Lt-Coi. A.C.

REFERENCE TO PREVIOUS CORRESPONDENCE; 7 7 Description of Enclsoure. - NAME &amp; DATE. 5 SUBJECT. 5 Translation of an article published^ Complaints against Mr. Belgrave. in the “ARAB WORLD', Egypt, under J the caption “A cry from Bahrain'. J/ Translation of a passage under the caption 'Aery fron Bahrain' published in the seventh issue of the 10th October, 1947, of The ARAB WORLD Magazine, issued in Egypt. / We have received an appeal from the people of Bahrain S in which they cry out against the oehaviours of the tyrannic British Adviser, Belgrave, against his cruel despotical orders and his government which is devoid oi justice and equity, against his opposition to any project whether educational or constructive^and against his stand in the way of any national undertaking that may enhance the Arabs' ana Islans’ prestige. In their appeal, these people have cited numerous instances of his acts which are more like those of the Nazi Gestapo and which Nurenburg Tribunals have unmasked. Among these are his sending of the educated students who clamour for reform to jail, his refusal to allow the publication of newspapers and magazines to enlighten the public mind, his hindering all efforts to establish national companies in the country and his acting in the way of lowering the standards of education, sociality and ethics, so that the nation may remain in a state of illetracy and the Tfcinds enveloped in an endless darkness. In conclusion, these people supplicate to the ARA^ LEAGUE to stretch them a hand and render them assistance against the oppressing imperialist and that is by raising the question of their country before the United Nation Organisation.42| PloasG sgg I^csid on^y -imulnr at p.91 of S.

Mr. Belgrave commenced his duties as Financial Adviser on 31.3.1926.(Page 16, file 5/20). The rate of pay fixed by his contract was Rs. 800-50-2200. (Page 13, file 5/20). In December 1934, Mr. Belgrave asked for an increase in pay (Page 40) t The matter was considered by the P.R. and the P.A. in6onsultation with Mr. Belgrave and it was agreed that instead his increment should be raised from Rs.50/- p.a. to Rs.100/- p.a.(page 46) and to this proposal the Shaikh agreed vide his letter at flag ’B*, and as will be seen from this letter the incrlment dated retrospectively from 1.1.1935. At the rate of Rs.800-50-2200, Mr. Belgraves pay at the end of March 1934 was Rs.1200. From 1.1.1935 his rate of pay became 1200-100-2200 thus making his present pay Rs.1600/- p.m. 2. The terms of contract appear to have been fixed by the P.R. in consultation with the Government of India and the Bahrain State (page 2 and 20 of file 5/20) and to these Mr. Belgrave agreed. j / 7/0 h Issued D.O.

No. C/386 The 15th April» 1948. Dear Sir Rupert, Thank you for letting me see your draft (returned herewith) about Adviser's received with your demi- official Letter No. B/3 dated the 12th April, 194.. 35/138 2 I have never seen it so stated but it seems reasonable to assume thst, even if we have nothing as explicit as /'policy' in the Gulf, our influence is intended to be a liberalising one. Please read my comments in the light ox this assumption* ^ Y mir nara. 9. Even if Belgrave were removed and it were possible for the Shaikh to rule by M personal influence” I doubt whether we should encourage such a reaction and whether it is possible to do so and, at the same time, to encourage greater association of the people in the government (your para. 10.) which is what we ought to do. 4 Your DaramlQ. I have never heard one of Belgrave* s non-British subordinates grumble at the lack _ of discretion grantee to him. The British who have done so or of whom I have heard doing so - I naturally do not encourage them - usually complain at the lack of d ^ scret ^^ raise the pay of their subordinates - a discretion probably not Granted Generally to its officials by any government in the world - and at the lowness of the pay of these subordinates. It is difficult (and unfair) to judge the merits of these complaints without hearing the other side. One can however say of them that they are probably made, in respect of finonej... nontrol bv every government o ficial in the /orld. Leigi complaint^first^maOe to me in 1945, that he had not sufficient budget control was remedied by his ceing given it. I have not found Belgrave difficult to do business witht when he merits the other adjectives you apply to him he is merely, I think, somewhat obliquely, orientally, and politely saying w No”. As you observe, the obsession about s ^ing roirmon to the Shaikh as well as to Belgrave; to both the memory of the lean years before the oil flowed is ever present. The worst feature of this is that it makes any outlay capital projects, and consequently any long range planning impossible; the element of chance involved, however sliglt, is too frightening. Primarily, The Hon'ble Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.b .,CSI., Political Resident, Persian Gulf,2 Primarily, however, it is the Shaikh, not Belgrave, who is responsible for this; and I very much doubt whether any Adviser could make him alter his attitude. But ( and here is the point of this comment ) I do not think that the ,, public ,f object; nor have I ever heard one of them spontaneously look far enough forward to call for measures to save Bahrain from the threat of new ports on the Saudi Arabian and Qatar coast. Like their ruler, they are M ad hoc” men, ready to try to knock the door down when they come to it, but not to spend thought, time or money on finding the key beforehand. It is we, not they, who think of expenditure on further material improvements. At present more money spent on education, a more regularised legal system and association by consultation in the government would probably meet their demands. 5 . Your para. 12 . I agree that we should aim for the appointment of an assistant. 6 . Your aara. 13 . The other British officials in the Bahrain Government are not there in an advisory capacity, nor do they raise any political problems. 7 . I am glad of the opportunity of also commenting on the draft where it deals with Kuwait, particularly in view of the contrast invited in paragraph 4, I was under the impression that there are not enough Jews in Kuwait to provide objects of agitation. But apart from that, one would imagine from the way in which it is mentioned that the Shaikh of Bahrain’s being assisted by a number of British officers (only two of whom apart from the police sergeants could have had any dealing with the disturbances), was in some way connected with the anti-Jewish agitation in Bahrain, The very special sense in which this is true ought, I suggest, to be made clear. Even if the Kuwait Government had a number of Jews to protect, it would not have to protect them in a town of mixed and foreign Moslem population visited by all sorts and conditions of men from all over the Gulf and, indeed, the Arab world; and, furthermore, in a State where British liberalising influence was present and effective before it was thought of in Kuwait. Agitation wss possible in Bahrain because of the comparitively free atmpsphere which has resulted from that influence. With all the defects of the Belgravian Government, with its personal favouritism and shaky legal system there is not a single Bahraini who would exchange it for the tyranny of the Kuwait Shaikhs and their public floggings, their prohibition of clubs and cinemas, and harsh punishments for political offenders. In both States the people need a focus for their discontents; in Bahrain they seem to have found it, not wholly justifiably, in Belgrave; in Kuwait, when it is allowed expression at all, it is, I believe, directed by the Shaikh on to the Agency. Because of this and of its nearness to anti-British feeling in 'Iraq Kuwait is therefore anti-pathetic to our influence while Bahrain is, on the whole.sympathetic. At the same time, the Kuwait Agency (because of the fewness of foreigners or of their being discouraged from appealing to it ?) has not the opportunity for participating in the State administration which occurs as a matter of course in Bahrain. Lastly/no one who has done business every day with Abdulla Mulla and with Belgrave will have any hesitation in deciding which is preferable in every way. 8 # If the contrast between Kuwait and Bahrain.as I see it.is accepted and if the assumption in any my paragraph 2 is correct then action in respect of Advisers in Kuwait is more urgently required than in Bahrain. But there is another reason for this. As long as the Shaikh of Bahrain can point to the illiberal regime we allow to exist in Kuwait he will have an unanswerable reply to our suggestions for improvement in Bahrain. Yours sincerely,Q30 | 5 t PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, 17th February, 1949. (10 ° / 4/49) The Shaikh came to see me on the 16th February and talked to me again about raising Belgrave's pay. I understand he is at present receiving R'j.2,200 per month plus Rs.50 per month entertainment allowance. The Shaikh proposes to increase his basic pay by Rs. 1,000 per month and to raise his entertain ment allowance to Rs.400 per month. He also proposes to pay Mrs. Belgrave Rs.400 or R:.500 per month for her work in respect of the Girls’ school etc. I told the Shaikh I approved of his intention to raise Belgrave's pay without commenting on the details. I am doubtful in any case whether we can raise any objection to these, but would be interested to know if you have any comments. r C.J. Pelly, Esquire, CBE., Political Agent, Bahrain. Confidential BAHRAIN RI 1949CON FIDFKTIAL . S.O.No.C/R-70. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 2?th February, 1949. r\ ^ ( (a' i Dear Sir Rupert, [ V Thank you for your semi-6ffilial letter No. (108/4/49), dated the 17th February, 1949, about the Shaikh's proposal to raise Belgrave's pay. 2. My comments on this are as follows: (1) The total of the increases including the pay proposed for Mrs. Belgrave comes to Rs.1,800/- or Rs.1,900/- a month - not far off Belgrave's present pay To anyone like ourselves, brought up to regard these things as far as possible by the light of / reason, these proposals are fantastic. # (2) I do not think any increase would have a bad effect on a man of Belgrave's calibre, but the tendency of these will be to make it difficult for him to restrain the Shaikh over lavishness towards his relations at the expense of the State budget. (3) If the Shaikh discusses the proposals again with us, it might be as well again to raise ^ with him the question of an assistant for Belgrave. The last reference to that is your semi-official letter No.B/184(19/204), dated the 22/25th June, 1948; but I am afraid that I have not spoken to Belgrave about it since then: indeed I have practically no hope of getting any further with the proposal through him Yours sincerely, His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSX, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.Confidential, iu 1 PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, 19th March, 1949. S ^08/7/49) Belgrave has told me that the Shaikh has granted him an increase of Rs. 1,000 a month in his basic pay and has raised his entertainment allowance to Rs.300 a month. Belgrave said that there had been some talk of giving his a monthly salary, but I gathered that nothing had been decided and that he himsel was not in favour of it.qc 1 - 1 n . $ 9i ! ‘ At a meeting between the Political Resident (Colonel Fowle), the Adviser to the Bahrain Government (Mr.Belgrave),and the Political Agent,Bahrain,(Colonel Loch),the question of arrange ments for carrying on Mr.Belgrave 1 s work during his absence on leave was discussed. 2. It was considered that as much use as possible should be made of the 1 Family Council r to whom many affairs are already referred by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin *Isa Al Khalifah. It was thought that the Courts could be left in the charge of Shaikh Salmanjand the Police in charge of Hajji Salman working under His Excellency Shaikh Hamad in person,care being taken to see tnat the budget provision was respected. 3. It was thought that Mr.de Grenier might be placed in charge oi the financial part of Mr.Belgrave’s work to tne extent of keeping a watch on the expenditure,it being clearly understood that his duty would be to* that expenditure was kept rigidly to the lines laid down in the budget. It was further thought that Mr.de Grenier should be instructed to bring any difficulties at once to the notice oi the Political Agent,although it was most undesirable that the latter should undertake the actual work of the Adviser. 4. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad has not yet been approached on the subject and it was decided that it would be well to place the matter before him. This will be done after details have been discussed between the Adviser and the Political Agent. 25-11-1933.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00016a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/899</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00016a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/899</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 42/1 Adviser to the Government of Bahrain'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-08-13T21:12:51</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (159 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 159; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

The early correspondence relates to setting up suitable arrangements to fill Belgrave’s role in Bahrain while he took six months leave in the summer of 1934.The rest of the file is predominantly concerned with general discussions regarding the alteration of Belgrave’s terms of service, covering his pay and leave, as well as specific arrangements for his leave in India in the early 1940s.In the final folios of the file, the correspondence discusses increasing opposition to Belgrave within Bahrain in the late 1940s. Of particular interest are folios 124-126, these being an anonymous letter from ‘the people of Bahrain’ to the Minister of Colonies in London, expressing their discontent with Belgrave’s position of power.
