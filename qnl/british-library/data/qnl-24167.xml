It is requested that the Residency Agent, Sharjah should be asked to scrutinize further the lists enclosed for the Rulers of \ ?n Sharjah and Dubai. 2. It seems that the requirements laid down in the letter sent with this office endorsement No.729 dated 26th June 1942, will be best met by your certifying that certain cars which should be specified are essentially required by the Ruler or for the needs of the State concerned. 3. A list of spare parts should then be drawn up for each car. The form in which the Residency Agent has forwarded the lists is confused. The Dubai list is headed by the words 11 (Ford car model 1939)” but items for 1940 models are included in the list. As no number of cars is mentioned as essential for the Ruler of Dubai it is difficult to judge, to quote one detail alone, on what grounds ”12 fan belts model 1940” can be required. Similarly, as no number of cars is mentioned as essential for the Ruler of Sharjah, whose list also bears the heading ”Ford car model 1939” it is difficult to judge the necessity for four fan belts for Ford car model 1938 or for four batteries. 4. The list for the Ruler of Ajman is clear and prima f^acie reasonable. 5. Reference paragraph 2 of your letter. Export licences, it is understood, are only issued to specific firms.

FACILITIES FOR RULER OF QATAR You will no doubt remember that we received instruc tions from the Agency that we were not to make purchases in the Bahrain markets on behalf of, or destined for, the Ruler of Q&gt;atar. We duly notified him to this effect. The Shaikh, however, still presses us to obtain him certain articles mainly for his cars, and also periodi cally sends us car parts for repair. He has been asked several times** verbally to apply to you if he wants any assistance in connection with his motor vehicles. There is no doubt that the Shaikh needs help from some one in a position to obtain motor vehicle parts from India and with access to a workshop, and the present situation m which he makes persistent attempts to obtain his require ments through us without success is becoming a source of irritation to him. It would assist us considerably if we were in a position to quote to him a practicable method of obtaining his require ments, and any suggestion you can make would be very much appreciated. As you know, this Company is not authorized to obtain motor vehicle equipment from India.

A list of spare parts required should then be drawn up for each car. 3. In their present form the lists are confused. The Dubai list, for instance, is headed M Ford Car Model 1939 M but items for 1940 models are included. As no mention is made of the number of cars essential for the Rulers,it is difficult to judge, to quote one detail alone, on what ground ”12 fan belts model 1940 ,, can be required. Similarly, as no number of cars is mentioned as essential for the Ruler of Sharjah, whose list also bears the heading 'Ford car model 1939J it is difficult to judge the necessity for four fan belts for Ford car model 1938 or for four batteries. 4.

Reference correspondence resting with your Express Letter No. 199-79/208, dated 6 th February 1943. 2 * I am desired to say that since the issue of the Government of India's Express Letter No.90l8(a)-N/42, dated 6 th January 1943, India's imports of motor vehicles and motor spare parts from the united States of America and Canada have been drastically reduced. The Government of India have therefore been compelled to review the situation and they have reached the conclusion that if a serious breakdown in civil transport is to be avoided, exports of motor vehicles and motor spare parts on the present scale must cease, so far as motor vehicles are concerned^ it has been decided that only second-hand motor cars may in future be exported and that / too in very small numbers indeed. I am to request that an estimate of the Persian Gulf requirements for 1943 be 1 [ furnished. . 3. The motor spare $arts situation is now extremely serious and in view of this fact it is necessary to review again the estimates so far submitted for persian Gulf Sheikhdoms. It is noticed for instance that the Bahrain estimate is based on the fact that there are 355 registered vehicles. Both in Bahrain and elsewhere it will now be necessary to frame estimates of tiie irreducible minimum requirements of cars which must be kept mobile for administrative and economic purposes. It is suggested that the estimate should be framed under three headings - (a) Cars of British political Agencies and their staffs. V I# ' (b) Cars of Rulers. , I .. - , I (c) Cars of Governments of sheikhdoms which it is essential to keep mobile for the purpose of administra tion or internal econoiiy. ' * I am to ask that you will review your requirements in the light of the above remarks. 4 * I am to enclose a statement of applications for export licences for spare parts which are at ©resent pending with the Gov^rnm^nt of India and to say that it ie not proposed to take any further action on them here. Those requirements which have your support will doubtless be included in the appropriate estimate. 6 . I am to say, however, that efforts will be made to obtain the spare parts listed in the enclosure to your Endorsement No. 311-13/219, dated 3rd March 1943. -\fs&gt; Yours sincerely, 3d/- j.C.S.

B. M’s political Agent, Bah min. D s'J Memorandum: - Reference your memorandum No.787-36/28 dated 17th April, 1943, I consider that the following vehicles are rmcessary for use during 1943:- For H.H. The Ruler For G-overnment of Bahrain For Manama Munici pality one touring car one pick-up ( $. j one3 ton lorry for P.W.D. one pick-up for general purposes. one 3 ton lorry for general . purposes. 2. In this connection it might be pointed out to the authorities that the Public Works Department of the Bahrain Government is almost entirely employed on carrying out military work and has been doing this all through the last year. 3. The Medical Department also is doing v/ork for the forces especially in connection with anti-malaria measures which entail carrying anti-malaria staff to distant part's of the island and distributing oil etc., in places 'where mosquitoes are breeding. The pick-up previously used for this purpose has now ceased to function owing to age. 4. There are now 34 buses on the roads. This number should be sufficient for local needs during 1943. There is not at present a serious shortage of buses but there is a shortage of spare parts to keep them going. If spares are not forthcoming it will become necessary to cannibalise some of the existing vehicles in eider to feed the others. 5. There are 14 'taxi” lorries in Bahrain and 5 private lorries now in use. This should be sufficient for 19432 requirements provided that spare parts can he obtained. If spare parts cannot be obtained I suggest that local owners should be given permission to import four new chassis to be fitted with bodies in Bahrain. 6 . I should like again to discuss the question of permitting the export of cars. In my opinion the really important factor is to prevent a reduction in the number of public vehicles, buses, taxis and taxi lorries. It is not of essential Importance to prevent private owners exporting their cars. I suggest that ’if an order was passed forbidding owners of public vehicles from convert ing them to private vehicles then the export of private cars would not be to the disadvantage of the public. At present taxi owners are being tempted to sell their taxis- to people who intend to export them and if such sales increase the transport facilities of the island will deter iorate. I have discussed the matter with Hr. Steele and he informs me that in some respects old Ford or Chevrolet cars are more useful here than newer cars of less uni versal type because t&amp;^spare parts for the former are less difficult to obtain and when they cease to work their spare parts are valuable for using on other Ford or Cheverolet cars.

The pick-u previously used for this pur ose is now worn out* (v) One three-ton lorry for general use by the Id&amp;nana Municipality. (vi) Four lorries and six buses for conveying labour era frm the towns of Mamma and Muharraq and outlying districts t© the Bahrain Petroleum Company* premises and back. (The number of labourer® employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company on 31st Parch 1943'was 2006 and will rise to over 4000 within the next few months)• Transport i s not provided by the Company for this purpose, am efforts to establish a labour c&amp;mp at A wall have so far not been successful.3/ • © (vii) One car for Mr. M.J. Jeffreys, the recent: arrived Engineer of Cable and Wireless Limited, Bahrain for whom a car is essential ©wing to the distance between his house and his office. 2 3. The estimate in paragraph 2 above represents the bare minimum of Bahrain’s essential requirements and will of necessity become much larger if spare parts for the existing transport in the island are not made available. In this connection I enclose, reference paragraph 3 ef the External Affairs Department’s V letter, a revised list ©f spare parts required for Bahrain. This is based on the number of lerries, motor buses and cars regis tered in 1943, namely 288, a figure which is not susceptible ©f * &amp; further reduction. The previous lilt, which was supplied by the State Engineer to Mr. Rogers last December ahd of which a espy was forwarded to the External Affairs Department with your letter Ns. C/i006, dated the 23rd December 1942, was based ©n the registered figures of lerries, buses and cars for 1942, which totalled 334. (The figure of 355 shown at the tsp ©f that list included 21 motor bicycles, for which we are not requesting spare parts from India). It will be seen that, whereas the number ©f registered vehicles has decreased since 1942 by 14 per cent, the numbers of spare parts required are; in general, only 10 % less than those given in the previous list. The reason for this is, of course, the deterioration in the condition of the vehicles in the island. 4. The three headings mentioned in paragraph 3 ©f External Affairs Department’s letter are not exhaustive as far as Bahrain is concerned, nor are they appropriate to the particular circumstances of Bahrain. Communicatiens in the island are entirely dependent on road transport, and of the 145 odd miles ©f roads in the island,( which do not include the subsidiary roads, amounting to roughly 75 miles, in the Bahrain Petroleum rt remaining 70 miles w©uld certainly not be classed in lurope higher than a 3 second class reads. The most important omission in the External Affairs Department’s letter is public transport, the importance of which in Connexion with the Oil Company’s ©perations hss already been indicated in paragraph 2(vi) above, and the parlous p© sit loir of which can be seen from the fact that the number of registered public vehicles has decreased from the barely adequate figure of 122 in 1942 t© the inadequate figure ©f 85 in 1943. Nor can the use of private cars be confined to the Ruler and the Political Agent and his staff In a mercantile community like that of Bahrain, where the focal points ©f commercial and public life are so far apart, vide the following table ©f distances 1 - Manama to the Naval Base at Jufair 3 miles' Manama to the R.A.F. Aerodrome at Muharraq ♦ • 3^ miles Manama to the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s premises at Awali 13 miles Manama to the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s Refinery at Sitra . 11 miles and to the Sitra Port ...... 14 miles Awali t© Zellaq. In all other cases it is necessary to travel via Manama. 1 2 Manama to the Receiving Terminal, and Port ©f Zellaq .*.*...*19 miles « . • 19 miles It may be added that direct roads exist between no two places mentisned in column 2 above, except from Awali t© Sitra and from5* As stated in paragraphs above, I consider the present number of registered vehicles to be the irreducible minimum having regard to the terms of paragraph 3 ©f External Affairs Department*s letter. The number is, in fact, belew the minimum to the extent detailed in paragraph 2. The distribution of existing registered motor vehicles is as fellevss*- Vehicles of the Political Agent and his staff... 3 (a) (b) (c) (d) Ce) 3 11 H.H. the Buler of Bahrain 14 ** ** the Al Khalifah, the Ruling Family of Bahrain, which numbers over 400 and several of tifhose members perform public functions for which the use of a car is essential to convey them to and from their homes, e.g. magisterial, municipal, educational, police **•*»•••• •••• .59 Cars ©f the Bahrain Government, which it is essential to keep mobile for administrative purpeses *••••♦••****• Municipal ears, (including two which combine the functions of fire engine and water carrier) 8 Public vehicles ...... .... .35 Private vehicles, including those belonging to individual members of the Bahrain Government, mercantile firms and Staff Employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the last ef whom alone numbered 183 ©n 31st March 1943 ♦.97, ►22 Total ..... 288 6. In conclusion I must emphasise that unless a sufficiency of spare parts for the vehicles detailed in the previous paragraph is received it win be necessary for the estimate of Bahrain’s requirements of cars from India detailed in paragraph 2 of this letter to be greatly increased. Distances in Bahrain are such that there is no alternative to motor transport. In India the carriage can be substituted for the motor car. In Bahrain, this alternative is precluded as fodder for horses is only available in very limited quantities, and its import from India is impracticable. If transport facilities in the Island decline further, it will be impossible to maintain oil production at its present level. Indeed, difficulties of transport for labour have already caused the Oil Company acute anxiety, and further deterioration in the position will have consequences more serious, in relation to the War, than can be envisaged with equanimity. 7.

Such is the condition of Kanoo f s damaged stock that it cpuld not possibly be described as consisting of so many damaged batteries. It is an assortment of salvage, including everything from badly cracked batteries to separate parts fit to use in repairing existing batteries. I see no reason why we should not allow a purchaser to use his permit to buy a completely damaged battery and with it to make good an existing battery, which he would then present to us for examination and marking. In this way we might get fifty working batteries in use,where' as if we try to force Kanoo to confine his sales to reasonably complete units only slightly defective the number might be limited say, hvycnty; Am I right in saying that if Kanoo sells thi: stock he cannot legally claim full value for insurant Acting State Engineer, Government of Bahrain.State Engineer, Government of Bahrain.

For the purposes of such valuation purchasers are informed that the selling price of a new intact battery in good working order is ?s.I50/-/-D« 0• JJo • / Political Agency, Bahrain, the 16th August 1943* With reference to your letters and our conversations on the subject of the 50 damaged batteries with Haji Khalil Kanoo, I dis cussed the matter with the Haji*s son Ibrahim this morning. He tells me that these batteries are less badly damaged than we thought (cf. f) yyour letter No# MA/93/62, dated the 12th August). Be says that only four or five cases are the outer covers cracked and that with the rest it is only the cell covers that are broken. All the batteries, he says, can be repaired by Indian experts here and be made fit for sale as complete batteries. I would suggest that you inspect the batteries and say whetner you agree. Ibrahim Kanoo tells me/that he has had a .tterles^ fJSZSt not 2# As regards price, letter from the Insurance Company to say that ■r-iA44 b __ insured against breakage, but only against marine and war risks. Be ^ thinks that the cost of repairing them should not exceed t 40 to If tnis is so, I tnink that he should be paid 3s 150 for each battery, exclusive of the cost of repairs. The landed cost of batteries from India is now, I believe, in the region of :s 850 to h 500 oer battery. In regard to the repairs, Ibrahim Kanoo would prefer that they should be effected at the purchaser*s expense. They would, however, be done I by.Indian battery engineers nomin ated by him, and under his guarantee. It will therefore be for Khalil Kanoo and the Indian engineers to agree before sale whether a particular battery is repayable or not. They would arrange between them for some kind of guarantee to be given by the engineers to Khalil Kanoo, and if any battery was not properly repaired, the engineers would have to repair it again without extra charge. It seems to me that an arrangement oh these lines could be made to the satisfaction of all concerned, though I have not been into the details of it. 3. Would you kindly, in due course, let me know the result of your inspection of these batteries anu also whether, as a result of it, you consider the arrangement suggested in the previous paragraph to be feasiole. ; 4. As regards the 24 batteries referred to in your letter No, 114/69/62, dated the 20th July 1943, Ibrahim Kanoo does not know the terms under which these batteries were purchased from America and would prefer me to see his father about them on the latter*s return to Bahrain, if you find that the damaged batteries can be put on the market as complete batteries, we shall presumably have enough batteries to keep us going until Khalil Kanoo*s return, and I would then discuss the case with him and let you know the result, 5. I have read this letter over to Ibranim Kanoo, in order that there should be no doubt that it accurately represents our conversa tion, Be has confirmed that it does so. Yours sincerely, G. E, Hutchings, Esq., Qffg. S tate Engineer, Bahrain, f S ^^ r . \jcssl. -as\1 v/ith reference to your letter No.1864 of 16/8/43, I have now seen the batteries, some 48 in number at Kanoo T s premises^ I must admit that none of them seems to be so badly damaged that it could not be put into service, even in the few cases where the container is cracked and would have to be replaced by a second-hand container (the latter, I understand are readily obtainable). The position is therefore much better than I thought, and is in fact much as Ibrahim Kanoo stated to you. I agree that the batteries should be repaired at the purchaser^ expense, preferably by the Indian workmen whom Kanoo mentions and under some kind of guarantee jjuch as he suggests. This need not,however, be a condition of sale, but a reasonable service given by Kanoo to the purchaser should the latter desire to have his battery repaired under Kanoo 1 s supervis^ion. Purchasers should be free to choose and take away their batteries for repair under an arrangement of their own, provided that they conform v/ith our regula tion in regard to sealing and inspection, as stated on the purchasing permits. I agree that Rs.I50/-could be reasonably charged for any of these batteries, even through the intact ones in the same consignment were sold at that price. Kanoo argues that if the damaged batteries were to be sold for less than Rs. 150/-/-, the intact ones should haV^e been sold for more in order to cover all his ex- pences. Steele was apparently not in agreement on this point, as he probably thought at the time that Kanoottp.tt 2 ’ would be compensated by insurance for the damage. Anyhow, the current price of new batteries is so mush higher than it was a few months ago that Rs. 150/-/- now a reasonable price. As regards the 24 new batteries, these 'will certainly not be so urgently needed if we can release over 40 repairable batteries from Kanoo T s stock. If all is nov/ in order, will you agree to issuing permits on the lines of the draft submitted to you with my letter NOfMA/93/62 of 12/8/43. /,u&lt; ' Yours sincerely, Captain M.Gr.

I do, however, think it would be advisable, in the interests of seilier and purchaser alike, that in each case they should have a defunlse understanding before hand whether or not such a guarantee is being given, as otherwise there will be a fruitful field for litigation* I enclose accordingly, for your consideration, a revised drafjLJaote for insertion in the permits to be given for these batteries.

As suggested to you and the State Engineer on the telephone the procedure to be adopted should be that the importers here having dra.m up their lists within their allotment as drawn up in the list from the State Engineer mentioned above, should submit their lists to the State Engineer. He should see that theM? lists are within the quota allotted and, In cases where the full quota has not been indented for, should add such further quantities as he himself considers necessary forfthe State, by agreement with the importer. 2. T;io lists have been forwarded to this office which are enclosed herewith. It will be seen that the Ford Agent’s list does not take up anything like the quota allotted, while the Chevrolet Agent’s list consists mostly of articles outside the quota. I should be grateful if these lists could be gone into by the State Engineer with the importers and brought into more present able shape. 3. The Hudson Agent has so far not nominated an exporter from India and despite promises shows no signs of doing so. I should be glad to know what stops the Bahrain Government proposes to take to ensure the import of Hudson spare parts. for Political Agent, Bahrain.telegrams 'FAKHROO' distributor DUNLOP PRODUCTS HERCULES CYCLE'S CROSLEV RADIOS WILLARD BATTERIES OWNER OF BORING MACHINES NATIVE CRAFTS EXPORTER OF (/'yjw CODES BENTLEY'S YOUSUF ABDULRAHMAN FAKHROO BAHRAIN.

H. B. M T s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum:- Reference your memorandum No. 1191-36/B8 dated 20th April, 1944. The 'l'ist-s-.of .requirement s of the tliree motor agejqjts are enclosed'^erewith. The lists include all Government 'requirement s. The agents do not wish the Government requirements to be dealt with separately so have included them -'in. the orders. 'The agents have informed the Sxate Engineer, Bahrain, it hat they are reluctant to place orders until-th^ry know the prices of the’goods. They also state that many of the spares are available on the black market in Bahrain and they are afraid that black market price may be lower than the new Govern ment prices. I am of the opinion that the agents themselves may still be holding big stocks of certain spares which may find their way onto the black market. We have never had a round up of car spares or tyres and such action v^ould be difficult to carry out effectively. In some cases the explanation of articles on the agents* lists not apparently shown on the list sent in by the State Engineer is that the Government list showed one item, i.e. carburator assembly, which is given by the agent under six different headings making up one carburator assembly. Since the State Engineer first made up lists of requirements the car position in Bahrain has changed very considerably. The things which were required over a year ago are not necessarily the same as are needed today. Many of the items now included in the agents lists and not previously included are small things which they know are not now available in Bahrain, some articles previously included are no longer necessary. Would it be possible to request the Indian Govern ment Department concerned to sanction the export of the goods in the three lists which now represent the present requirements for the public and for the Government? It may be pointed out that since the first list was made out by the State Engineer about two years has elapsed and since the second list was sent in to you by the State Engineer over a year has elapsed and in this time the nature and quantity of the requirements has changed.

He tells me that the Shaikh lias included m ms list a number of old cars, to supply which with spare parts would be sheer waste of money and valuable spares. He has sent me the statement flagged ’’A', which provides for one Ford Vg pick-up (I imagine the same as the 'Ford lorry' at item 1 of the Shaikh's list, and the only car which is common to the two lists), one Ford 2 ton truck and 2 Buicks, which he thinks ought to suffice for the Shaikh* In this connexion please see paragraph 2 of Bushire memorandum Ho. 122-79/208 of January 23rd, which says that we should certify that certain cars, to be specified, are essentially required by the Ruler or for the needs of the state concerned'? 2. Mr. Dickson expressed it as his opinion that, unless and until the Shaikh of Qatar gets a decent mechanic, the supply of any spare parts to Qatar would be a waste of good stuff, as they have no idea how to look after cars; there is not even a grease gun for the Shaikh's cars. He added that he thought that some of the spares required would be available with Khalil Kanoo. 3. on . Mr. Dickson says that the welding machine (last item n the Shaikh's list,) is useless, v, f, , /?. P.U.C. I.//f/would n* before drafting. .ike to speak regarding the 'repairs') r ? 7 ^ (c; as regards Bahrain and para 3 of P.U.C.I^ P.AV-irftends, I believe, to reply that 355 (or thereabouts) registered vehicles do represent. Bahrain’s minimum requirements, and this point has not therefore been included in the draft to tne Adviser. If this is correct we should, I think y find out from the State Engineer how many vehicles we have left in Bahrain that are m reasonably sound condition and if this number is now less than 355,(as it well may be) what amendment will be necessary to the list at pp 2 - 3 . Para 3 of the note ctt pp 43-44 in the Pinked File (read with the Adviser’s letter at pp 7-10 £bid) contains the necessary details to enable us to classify our cars under the 3 headings given in para 3 of P.H.C. I, so long as we include the Ruler’s family amd entourage (whose cars number - or numbered - 81 in all&gt;, under heading (b). If P.A. thinks^ they should be shown separately from those of the Ruler himself we will have to get the necessary details from the state Engineer.(I) Taxis and (ii) Lorries and buses.could be shown under separate heading^ in our reply. 0 ) w H* * - • (i A, Juifrd ‘ tu^ h-*) f j k Af* : '/7^f 4- : 'hc : ' V '•% V iiilil If!' • | ■ r 1 V r - ‘'‘A ken ( 4 ) Theonlv person from whom a certain answer to this' 1 question could be obtained is Khalil B'anoo; I have not spo 1 to him pending P.A’s instructions. Gunn informs me, however, that payment for these batteries will almost cer tainly have been made out of Bahrain’s dollar allotment.' From 16-10-1940 to the end of September 1941 the Eastern Bank here sold ^ Khalil Kanoo 24,965 dollars, 'they have sold him none since then, but he is still making periodical remittances to America from the dollars sold to him illei*. Ee could not otherwise obtain dollars; he may have had a small credit in America before the war but ! r. Gunn thinks it unlikely that he paid for these batteries out of JT- if it ever existed, hLa tr.ne^- nred44, will probably have been used up before he bought more dollars from the Eastern Bank in 1940-41. Under the instructions of the Beserve Bank of India, a definite condition made in every sale of dollars, (which! the Eastern Bank are authorised to sell to individuals in Bahrain up to 75% of their pre-war purchases,') is that the goods purchased with them must not' be re-exported to any non-Empire country. I do not think therefor^thfe there can be any justification whatever for Khalil Kanoo to re-export these batteries now. /''The present practice is, I understand, that the Eastern Bank gives a letter of credit on a banker in America saying that payment of a certain sum may be made on production */ of-bills of lading and shipping documents^ a further condition is that bills of entry must be produced before the bank here on the goods ’arrival. This practice was not in force at the time of the sales to Khalil K-anoo but the stipulation that / goods purchased must not be re-exported^to any non-Empire^ J-t*5 country wethcr* in fore O i &amp; 0 &lt;/ |U\73 Since I dictated the above note, p.u.cs 2 and 5 have been received from the State Engineer. They relate to the 50 cracked batteries left, out of the consignment of 130 Good-Year batteries received by Khalil Kanoo oh March 3th last from America. Mr. Hutchings tells me that Khalil Kanod has been as difficult as possible over the whole business. He has produced no invoices (and Mr. Hutchings is unaware on what basis Mr. Steele fixed the price of Bs 150 per battery for the undamaged batteries,) and he is doing his best to frustrate his efforts to inspect the damaged batteries. The suggestions contained in p.u.cs 1 and 2 are somewhat confusing. The former suggests that Khalil Kanoo should be paid 3s 150/- per battery (the same price as for a completely sound battery) which will cover the cost of repairs; the enclosure to p.u.c. 3 suggests that the ^rice should not exceed 3s 150, but that purchasers should be responsible for the repairs. 2. Mr. Hutchings has, I understand^ seen a few of these batteries, though it seems that Khalil Kanoo has been careful to let him see only the worst dam ^gd . From what he has seen already, he thinks that some, e.g. ^which have their plates cracked, could best be canibalised, while others which are only slightly damaged, could be repaired and sold as they are. I think|the best plan would be for Mr. Hutchings to inspect the Lmt ibiifc ^ &lt; aa *^*-4*$ .&lt;»**_.*-cA id (ftci X. batteries land decide which of them can be repaired. These &gt;c should then be repaired byKhalil Kanoo who, as he will pre sumably be compensated by the insurance Company for the damage sustained by these batteries, should certainly bear the expense of repairing them. They should then be for sale at a price not exceeding 3s 150 per battery. Those batteries which are not worth repairing can be canibalised, but I can see no reason why the new batteries to be made from them should be sold for more than 3s 150; this point cou4i y however, be decided after reconstruction was completed. I do not agree that Khalil Kanoo*s lack of co-operation in this affair should be rewarded be his being allowed to sell the damaged batterie^ for 3s 150/- as suggested at 'X 1 * in puc 3, while profiting alsQ/the insuranc money which will presumably come to him.^ v'- W jy 'l / 2l/ ' e \. 3. P.A. will probably be sending for Khalil Kanoo in conpec|ion with p.u.c. 1,and he may like to deal with p.u.c.S“2 and 3 in the same interview, Mr. Hutchings will be grateful if orders can be passed as early as possible, as these 50 damaged batteries and the 24 dealt with in p.u.c. 1 comprise the total stocks in the Bahrain market, 4. I might add that we were not*’consulted before the suggestion at 'A* in p.u.c. 2 was made to Khalil Kanoo. There is no question of the .removal of price control from the sale of batteries, and Khalil Kanoo will, I imagine, get compensation from the insurance Company in any case^ irrespective of what is decided about the sale of batteries © here. v*“' CfyS^. a /1343 ^a-M/42/6 z- ^ &lt;r '/ i Jr'y* __ i+ It 1 «Ol if Mflp }21 /» i{ a ni ' _v I, iMw-.y&lt;J ft! c 7 ?• *rV ^7 ' /&amp; /juxZ ^L£a^'^' ^t-c/?
