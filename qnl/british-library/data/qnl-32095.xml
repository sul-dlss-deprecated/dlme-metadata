PURKIS LIMITED 53 YONGE STREET 1933. Dear Sir, We thank you very much for your lette^dated the S5th ultimo, which arrived this morning, Ref. No.104 of 1933, informing us you would like our advice as to the^possibility of installing one of our Tennis Courts in the Bahrain Agency. , From your remarks, we should say that our 'Griselda' surface would suit. T e surface is a reddish-brown in colour and it is composed of a granite-like material, whicn is^ quarried in the Malvern district, and it possesses wonderful blinding Qualities. This Court is in great demand in this country, owing to the fact that when it is laid it requires very little in the way of after-attention to keep it in order. We have laid this Court at many places in this country where no water is available, consequently it relies entirely upon the rainfall for the water it mets 'and it is occasionally rolled. You remark the climate is verv hot and extremely damp with intervals of dryness, and we if necessary you could water the ^ourt during any long of dry weather with salt water, which would he quite saois— in fact, this would be better than fresh water, inasmuch is a deliquescent. Replying to your queries in the order set out:- presume periods factory as salt (a) ve usually lay our 'Griselda” material on an ash foundation, the latter being put down approximately 5” deep, with the!P&gt; continuation to Lieut. Colonel G. Loch. Ist .February&gt; 193 . 3. /-f 0 -- 2 — (b) (c) (d) le) rough ashes in the bottom and the fine on the top. In your case we should advise breaking up the concrete iuoO sridll pieces about the size of a man’s fist downwards and leaving it spread over the area, afterwards putting 3’' or 4' of ashes over this, roll and consolidate, and then finish off wi^h approximately 1' of fine ashes which have passed through a ' mesh screen, and to get this material even and level it shoulo 'be screeded off with screed strips and a straight edge. The foundation would then be ready for the surface. Also we usually put a brick on edge or concrete margin round the site to hold the materials together when being rolled. you will gather from the foregoing remarks that we consider this uourt would stand up against the climatic conditions you have explained to us. We think you would be able to lay the material yourself with the heir of the local Public «»orks Department, and the ^Griselha' material is put down over the ashes approximately 1” deep, and as in the case of the fine ashes we screed it with screed strips and a straight edge to get an even thickness over the site and to finish with a level and even surface. We have answered this in C'. You mention an area of 95 ft. by 45 ft., which we consider rather on the small side, as a matter of fact, the ideao. siea in this country is 120 ft. by 60 ft., allowing 21 ft. at each end for run back and 12 ft. at the sides for side play. How ever, to cover the area you mention of 95ft. x 45ft. you would reouire approximately 14 tons of n Griselda ff material to cover same l w deep, and we should have to send this out m sacks, and the price would be 30/- per ton, free on rail our Malvern Works, olus^sacks at 1/- each, and we usually allow 14 sacks to the ton consequently there would be 196 sacks. We have been in touch with the Shipping Agents and they inform us the rate from Malvern would be approximately 77/6d. per ton, although they informed us if the traffic is definitely passing they may be able to get a two or three shillir/g^reauction. This does not include any duty charges should there be any duty to pay. We think this gives the information you have asked . ii! ||Continuation to Lieut • Colonel G. Locii. !.s t.. Le 'bx*u a 2 ry_ ^ igj &amp; — 3 — for, but if there are any further particulars we can supply please let us know. If you favour us with your esteemed order we can arrange ^;o despatch the material within a week or 10 days of the receipt of s ame . We presume you can obtain the Tennis Fittings, i.e. the posts, sockets and playing net locally, but we could send you our 'Non-trip' Lead Marking Tapes &amp; Pins at £7.10.0.' per set free on rail our Leicester w orks, packed ready for shipment. Also no doubt you could obtain.the stop netting surround locally. We have not constructed any Courts in the Persian Gulf previously, but we have laid our Courts in many countries abroad, including America, Canada, New Zealand, Tangier and almost all the European countries, and the fact that our Overseas trade increases year by year proves, we think, they have given satisfaction. At the present time we have orders on hand for six Courts to belaid in Australia, and one of our expert foremen is on the way there now. These Courts, however, are our improved Red Courts similar to those at Wimbledon, but this material is a little more expensive and it is a little more difficult to lay.

Dalrymple Belgrave Esquire Bahrain.THE CU^TO?HOUSE: BAHRAIN: 31st January, 1935., Dear Bel^ra^c/ The method of surfacing a tennis court, which Nash explained to me, according to his successful treatment in Poona, wes to mix dry cement in with the selected mutti earth in the proportion of one to six; fine earth is best, possibly mixed with a little sand. Thoito spread this over the court to a depth.* of about two inches, and, having damped it well, not thoroughly wetted it, have it carefully rolled in, at first rather lightly, and then heavily. He considered that the dampness of the local air would greatly help towards the setting, and thvS the cement forms a binder of the earth, end v;il go on hardening, the lor^er it remains, and the more it is rolled. V/hen there is loose cement dust on the pier, I often water it with the idea of preventing surface/lust, and even this rudimentary effort produces a good effect. I believe that it is.well worth trying. 4D.0.NO. 305-18/5 Dated the 25th February 1935 Just a line to thank you very much indeed for the roller which is excellently suited for luyin.., aovm Jie tennis court and will be so for keeping it in order.

Sir, Subject I beg to submit the attached estimatetennis court improvement,as per verbal instruction of Assistant Political Agent,for your information. ntaf I do not think that planks will in waf case improve the situation,and condition.The trouble is with the mud. or clay. ■ As a rule all clays contain salt to a great or les.s extent .Bahrain clay which is generally tp.ken fron sea bed naturally contains more salt than those in gardens. The presence of salt in clay always attract moisture from atmosphere,as salt is amorphous substance,and Sahrain being an island,the humidity in atmosphere is gVeat.While salt absorbs moisture,clay swells,and when it shines water gets evaporated,and the space occupied by water is occupied by air,thus alternate wetting and drying makes tennis court to disintegrate. To avoid disintegration we have tp employ roller and keep court well wet,once it becomes dry disintegrati on will atonce begin. ^he rate for item 2 rather seems to be excessive. But thefact is thiy are to be brought from about 4 miles -away. If a lorry is arranged the cost will b*e much reduce* I beg to remain, f f B p ir i.3^&gt; Tennis Court# xt proposed to provide the following to the *ua tennis court# 1 Providing and fixing deal wood planies 10inches wide oy 1 inch and 12 feet long eadh^ll round the tennis court.The planks are to he coated with 2 coats of coal tar,and they are to hurried into to the ground,and the tops of planks should he flash with the level of the couft. 2 All the depression on four sides of the court is to filled in with good clay and sand. Clay and sand should he free from salt 4 to a greater extent. It should he well rammed,and consolidated 3 A layer of 1 inch thick small shells is to he spread over item Ho.2 The ohject of providing planks allreund. the court,is to made the didew stable, i.e the sides of the court that becomes powder and flys away by air.

Dear Sirs, I should be grateful to be informed whether it would be possible for you to build one of your tennis courts here in His Majesty*s Political Agency, and, if so, to be given an estimate of the cost. 2 # Perhaps you could arrange with Holloway Brothers of Westminster London, a British firm of building contrac tors at present engaged on building contracts here, to supervise the laying of the court on your behalf. 3 . Alternatively, you might care to sell the materials with full instructions for laying, and to leave it to us to get the court built. 4 , Were your courts a success here and reasonably economical to bull it is probable that further orders would follow. 5 # For your information] I would add that in summer temperatures here reach 100 and that the atmosphere is excessively moist. lours faithfully,GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN STATE ENGINEER'S DEPARTMENT Ko.frt - 3i “66 BAHRAIN 10th September,1947 Dated: 24th Shawal, 1366 Dear I return herewith the En-Tout-Cas literature.

You could safely entrust this work to Uchi and Tomino the local Contractors who v/ere responsible for the laying of the Euharraq landing strips.

I enclose literature (which Leigh has already seen). I have just had Salman Uchi along and have been trying to explain to him how the court should be laid since I want to get an estimate from him. I have not had very much success as his English is none too good, and he did not understand ^tha^terms used in the enclosures. I wonder if you wSft. possibly get hold of him and try and get an estimate out of him. It would be most helpl'ul too if you could suggest sub stitutes for such of the material required as are not locally availaole. ((yp POLITICAL AGtiNCX No. t _-(^j /ii u riUUH BAHRAIN.

WHEN ORDERING PLEASE STATE NEAREST GOODS STATION DIRECTIONS FOR USE. 1. —Always keep Court rolled in Winter as soon as frost is thoroughly out, and if Court is not in use it should be rolled twice per week when weather permits. 2. —If surface of Court (after rolling) shows any black ash, stickiness or slow surface drainage; roll Court and then dress over surface with Medium Dressing (using 3 bags per court, not more), well roll it in dry (i.e., do not water after dressing), if ash still shows, a second dressing and rolling is advised, then one dressing of our Fine Top Dressing (3 bags per Court) watered in and rolled and repeated if necessary. During Winter, if surface becomes soft and sticky, apply 3 bags Winter Medium, well roll in, and repeat with a further dressing if necessary. ■* 3.—If Court shows any loose or gritty surface after rolling, this loose grit should be very lightly looted off, then the Court should be well rolled and dressed up with Fine Top Dressing as described in Clause 2—no Medium Dressings are required in this case. 4. — Slightly sunk or hollow places should be lightly pricked up with an ordinary garden fork (only the surface, not the ashes under) and levelled through with Medium 'E.T.C.” Material to the balance of the Court, then well watered and rolled solid, and then dressed over lightly with Fine Top Dressing, well watered and when drained rolled well. 5. —Always remember never to put on Fine Top Dressing too thickly (never more than 3 bags per Court in one dressing) rather repeat the dressings if necessary, watering in and rolling after each application. 6. —Send for Top Dressing, etc., in good time, as we always get a rush of orders betw'een February and May. It will keep any length of time if stored in a dry place. SPECIAL NOTE All prices quoted in this list subject to alteration without notice.' - DOLLARS FROM AMERICA.

'EN-TOUT-CAS” Tennis Court Surfacing Material has been sent to America (approx. 55 courts), also to Sweden, Canada, Iraq, Australia, Kenya, etc. Foreign Buyers realise the value of 'E.T.C.” materials otherwise they would not pay heavy freightage. In a number of cases orders are for clubs where Davis Cup and Championship Meetings are held. EN-TOUT-CAS TOP DRESSINGS For HARD LAWN TENNIS COURTS. Recent events necessitate another WARNING to Hard Court Owners. Numerous substitutes have, from time to time, been offered by Brickmakers and others, in some cases at 1ow t prices. We must warn court owners of the detrimental effects these substitutes have had to the surfaces of '‘E.T.C.” Hard Lawn Tennis Courts. Regularly advices reach us that good courts have been ruined by using materials made by firms who have no knowledge of the essentials necessary to improve a court surface and we have had to re-surface courts because unsuitable material has been used. J I 1 r A I m % “EN-TOUT-CAS” RED TOP DRESSINGS (Medium and Fine) will always considerably improve a semi-loose surface of any make. “E.T.C.” Red Top Dressings are specially blended to cover— (1) COLOUR. ( 2 ) HARDNESS AND SURFACE DRAINING. (3) BIND. iFLAKED CAUSTIC SODA THE BEST OF ALL FOR KILLING MOSS AND THE CHEAPEST. In stubborn cases of Moss on Hard Court surfaces. Drives, etc., due to long neglect, we have found that an application of Caustic Soda will destroy the growth. It should be mixed at the rate of 8 lbs. of Soda to 15 gallons of water and applied with a watering can. Use with great care. Wear gloves when mixing. Keep away from shrubs, etc. Price.—32/- per cwt. carriage paid England and Wales. (In 1 cwt. drums). CORRY S Hard Court MOSS REMOVER Specially made in Red or Grey. Also used for Paths, Carriage Drives, etc. Makers guarantee it effective for 9 to 12 months. Directions. —Sprinkle the Powder evenly at the rate of | lb. per sq. yard. Can be applied during light rain; or lightly watered in after application. Prices.—£ cwt. 22/-; 1 cwt. 40/-. All prices carriage forward. Please state colour required. Non-Poisonous SPECIAL WEED KILLER Owing to Act of Parliament it is now impossible for us to retail poisonous weedkillers—so we are concentrating on the sale of a special non-poisonous weedkiller, which has proved extraordinarily successful and at the same time very economical. Full particulars how to use, etc., on each tin or keg. Prices: . 1 gall. 12/-; 5 galls. 48/-; 10 galls. 90/-. Carriage forward. HARCORSAL For use on Semi-loose Hard Courts during frosty weather. Harcorsal, as supplied in pre-war days, is no longer available because certain chemicals used in its preparation are now wanted for essential purposes. The makers have, therefore, introduced HARCORSAL SUBSTITUTE which has been found very satisfactory. Price 11/6 a cwt., plus carriage. Sample sent on request.7 4 ' DEEPAL ' — 2, 4 - D Lawn Weeding revolutionised by the use of “Deepal,” containing 2, 4-D—Non-Poisonous—Harmless to Grasses—The Modern Selec tive W 7 eed Killer. Science has solved a problem by the introduction of this new compound called 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid, one of the group of chemicals known as Plant Growth Regulators. A Selective Weed Killer having the remarkable property that, when applied to turf at a carefully pre-determined strength it Kills AH The Common Weeds While Leaving The Grass Unharmed. Packed in the following sizes:— 1 Pint (to treat 1,000 sq. ft. of turf), 8/6. 1 Quart (to treat 2,000 sq. ft. of turf), 15/-. 1 Gallon (to treat 8,000 sq. ft. of turf), 40/-. Ask for Leaflet giving full details of application. We have supplied this Selective W r eed Killer to many clubs and private customers during 1947 and have used “Deepal” for our own contracts. W'e have been amazed at the splendid results obtained. A special feature is the ease of application. The solution can be spread over the whole expanse of turf by an ordinary fine rose watering can, it is not necessary to apply to each individual patch of weeds, and it will give efficient results as stated above, killing the weeds without harming the grass. See also “Verdone” Selective Weed Killer on page 14. THE ADVICE OF EXPERTS . We have been making Hard Lawn Tennis Courts since 1910 and OUR SUPREMACY IN THIS WORK HAS NEVER BEEN SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED.

(see over)” S I L V El * FOX H STAINLESS STEEL TENNIS RACQUETS Although v/e are able to supply Tennis Racquets by the leading makers we do not carry c large stock because we find that players like to call at their local sports dealers and spend some time over their selection. The Tournament and Club Models are supplied in throe types. Typo 1. For the lighter lady. Type 2. For the average player. Type 3. For the heavier man. The 'Silver Fox' is not the first metal racquet ever made but it is the most satisfactory. IT IS STRUNG WITH GUT. The metal racquets strung with wire were never satisfactory but the Silver Fox, strung with gut, is a first class racquet. The gut is orotccted against damage from contact with the court. Every hole is eyeletted so that gut passes over a smooth surface and the risk of breakage caused by friction is eliminated. The main strings arc rubber cushioned,permitting high tension without stress. No press is needed.

Dear Sir, Your letter of the 26th June No. 1985-1 8 /^ ^ $ If you had made your Court in accordance with the letters we sent to you dated 23rd July 1947, which is or should be a Green No-Upkeep Court, then you would not require Plastic Marking Tapes, as these are only used on semi-loose Courts, i.e. where there is no bitumen emulsion used in binding. You should mark out your Court with a good white road paint, i.e. similar to what is used for marking the white dividing lines on the roads of this country, and if you have difficulty in obtaining this we could send it. Plastic Tapes are only used for the semi-loose type of Court, i.e. Courts that require watering and rolling to keep them in good condition. If we can be of any further assistance to you, please be good enough to let us know. -Mi.

I have seen the Agency Tennis Court as well as the Adviser*s. The latter, though not entirely free from soft patches, consists of clay simply rolled and levelled till consolidated. In order to make its surface sufficiently hard to play it is watered and rolled every day, even flooded occasionally. 2. The Agency Tennis Court seems to have been reconditioned from time to time. At present the upper layer consists of unbumt gutch and the lower one of a coat of mud plaster mixed with straw. In my opinion a clay one-without straw - should be tried next. The fact is that the clay here is impregnated with a certain amount of salts which will affect the surface adversely when left to the mercy of the v/eather. But when watered the salts come up and fom a hard crust, which evidently gives success to the Adviser*s Court. But before attempting to renew the Agency tennis court I would suggest that the present surface of unbumt gutch may be tried once more and given a similar treatment, that is watering and rolling everyday. Being gutch, though unbumt, I believe, it has sufficient binding quality to work satisfactorily. ^ 30-9-1935.18/V' \-7^r Agency Tennis Court . I submit for consideration the question of e ^ y.. going up to Government for sanction for the construction of a tennis court for the Agency, and put iorward the proposal on the following grounds. (1) The P.A. entertains roughly aoout 100 to loO guests (2) The British and American colony oi tne Jiax^rain (3) The transfer of the Naval Station to Bahrain orings sho ild have a tennis gourt built at Government expense, since the B.P.C. and the Adviser have good courts. sanction ed recently a tennis court at Government expense: Bahrain f s need can easily oe urged on tue auove ^roauus, and the P-A* Bahrain’s need x or one is more ^ressin &amp; tnaxx perhaps, the P-A. ‘Kuwait *s. be at Government expense but will be maintained oy us from unofficial or other funds.

The Court has not yet been rolled as on one day the we re prisoners came and/apparently sent away again without doing anything. Yesterday they were taken away to get water, so no rolling was done. 2. Now (0800 on 1st December) a lorry load of clay has come,but no one to lay it. 3. We shall have to be cont§*&amp; with rolling after putting the clay down - the Court should now be watered well and the lorry unloaded and the clay placed in a heap on the South-west comer of the Court with Agency bags over it to keep it damp. 4.

Would A.P.A kindly get an est' mate for doing this. 3. V’ould A.P.A also kindly get the tennis court measurements from Mr. Belgrave and ask Doctor Holmes to help in the measuring out of the court. I think that it would be a good thing to put down small metal or w r ood peg marks at the different angle points so that if the lines get washed out by rain they can be easily renewed. 4.

Mr. Russell Brown has spoken to me with feeling on more than one occasion about p^eople who write to his subordinates instead of dealing through him when they wanted anything from the Company. This is worth remembering. I spoke to him about the “High melting point” and he said that it would cost us about Rs.20/- a barrel from BAPCO Mr. Uchi and suggested that should try R.A.F. who had some for Rs.3/- per barrel. Mr. Uchi should comment on this proposal and if he is unable to obtain it from the R.A.F., I shall write to Mr. Brown. He said that he would supply the Asphalt with the highest melting point..

Ask for quotations from Lil]ywhite and the Army and Navy Stores for the net with all its fittings. As- for the back screens I had forgotten Ar.P.A’s suggestion,which I think is a good one, that we use wicker back screens made locally. None need therefore be ordered for the present at any rate, but we should ask Uchi to quote for knitting them at both ends of the court. They should be not only on the top of the end walls, but also on the faces of the walls so as to present a softish surface fr^m ^j|ich balls will not bounce a great distance. Theif Should be similar to the screens done in ? the P.C.L. tennis court. I see from the advertisement between Serials 15 and 16 that En-Tout-Cas Co.
