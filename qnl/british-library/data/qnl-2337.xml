He has a very remarkable record and it seems a great pity that he should be left in Norfolk doing relatively nothing. I am afraid.though.that in view of his past in Central Asia, it would not be possible to use him in the Soviet Union, even despite the change in the situation there since the invasion of Germany. I am also very doubtful whether v/e coild use him working in with Russians outside the Soviet Union, possibly in Iran (Persia)^' We are consulting the War Office as to v/hether they may have some suitable job for him. Por a man in his position and with his past any job would have of course to be a considerable one and it is not easy to see at the moment where he could be fitted in. Yours sincerely.

HILL HOUSE, NORTHREPPS, CROMER, NORFOLK. 3rd July, 1941. .: J Ly dear Patrick, I wonder whether my services juld he usefully employed now that we are in with‘Russia. You yourself know that I was in Tashkent for 14 months in 1918-19, and in Bokhara for two. These are regions very little known to our officers. Perhaps this local knowledge with a colloquial knowledge of Russian, might he useful to the country in the present circumstances. I do not think that after so many years the Soviet authorities would hear any resentment at things done during what they call the 'Intervention Period' • I would he very glad if you would pass this suggestion on where it is most likely to he taken up. I attended a course of lectures on Military Intelligence at the W.O. just before the War.■■■■ I attach a brief curriculum vitae. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) F.i.;.BAILEY.Lt -Colonel F.LV;ailey, C.l.S .

I am sorry not to have replied before to your letter of the 31st : rch* h&amp;t if you will c 11 at the Office we can a range to let you see such papers as we have on the matters which you mention, on the usual condition, of coursej that you would obtain the permission of the Secretary of State before publishing anything on the subject. Yve are not at all certain that in the circumstances of the present time it would be considered desirable to publish any account of your mission to Turkistan. It is a question on which we should have to consult the Foreign Office. It would, however, of course be easier to do this and to consider the matter after you had prepared the script of what you would propose to say, if, despite the possibility of there being objections to publication, you are willing to go so far ahead with the project on this understanding.
