She describes her education, as an undergraduate student at AUC from 1958 to 1962, and (like others who returned to AUC as faculty) her study in its Solid State Science Master’s program and then university-supported doctoral study abroad, at Rensselaer Polytechnic University in the U.S. in the case of both Askalani and her husband Anwar Kinawi. She offers a view of how the sciences developed at AUC in the 1960s and into the 1970s, such as the role of Chemistry and later Solid State and Materials Engineering Chairman Adli Bishay and that of President Thomas Bartlett, the transition from older facilities to the new Science Building, and expanding academic programs. The creation of the School of Sciences and Engineering, and the division of the Science Department into separate disciplinary departments are also covered, as well as administrators’ approach to the sciences. Issues of research expectations and equipment and facilities, including the impact of the move to the New Cairo campus with its expanded laboratory and other facilities, are addressed as well. She discusses fellow long-term faculty members in the sciences and engineering as well. Askalani also gives an account of the lawsuits and other actions taken by Egyptian faculty members in the 1990s, seeking redress for inequalities in compensation and retirement age as compared with foreign-hire faculty. </dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>oral histories</dc:type><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017; American University in Cairo.
