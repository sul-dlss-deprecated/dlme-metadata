The operations which were initiated as a direct result of the murder of the occupants of Busaiya Post and subsequent acts of aggression by Akhwan tribes may be regarded as the culminating point in a series of incidents which have involved minor and spasmodic operations since the foundation of the Kingdom of 'Iraq in late 1921. 2. The aggression of the Najd Tribes against 'Iraq (whether through Ibn Sa'ud's ambitions, his hostility to King Faisal, economic necessity, or through whatever he assigned as their cause) has been persistent throughout this period and has increased both in fact and in importance since the attempt to regulate tribal relations and delimit the geographical frontier between the two states. (Muhammerah Treaty 5/5/22, 'Uqair Protocols of 2/12/22.) 3. Almost coincident with the accession of King Faisal to the throne of 'Iraq was the defeat by Ibn Sa'ud of the Shammar Amirate and the capture of Hail. This not only brought him into closer touch with the tribes of 'Iraq but resulted in the voluntary exile of a large body of Shammar tribesmen who took refuge in 'Iraq, whence they began a series of raids against Najd, ostensibly in retaliation for raids from Najd on 'Iraq. Ibn Sa'ud believed these raids were made with King Faisal's approval. 4. Raids and counter-raids continued, in which the 'Iraq shepherd tribes, who occupy the position of clients of the great Badawin Chiefs, underwent severe losses in both men and stock. The Dhafir, the most southerly of the 'Iraq Badawin, occupied an unenviable position and also suffered. 5. Meanwhile the enterprise of Ibn Sa 'ud's tax collectors, combined with the security which compliance with their demands was found to give, and the inability of the 'Iraq Government to afford any effective protection, resulted in a situation where the geographical boundary became meaningless, and the control of the desert was automatically falling into the hands of Ibn Sa'ud and his agents. Further attempts at diplomatic settlement (Kuwait, 17th December, 1923) had failed, and the establishment of the Abu Ghar Post in January, 1925, did little to check this growing encroachment. (C14279) Pk .3031 12 28 25) Hw. (Gp. 1)4 6 Hopes were entertained that agreement had been obtain^ bv the Bahrah and Haddah instruments of November, l9-&gt; • The Maid Shammar had been removed to the Jazirah north of rte iuphrates. and they, and other ^ seller refiiuees were made subject to recognised Iraq Shaikhs, wno had strict Ructions as to their control. These measures were ff ^i p Raiding bv refugees continued and culminated in a large raid ^nto Kuwait on 5th October. 1926 which was successfully intercepted by aircraft and armoured cars on its return. In effect, a period of quiet ensued for the she P^ e ' ourchased it must be admitted, by their payment of the QO rallod '' 7ikat ' to Naid, although no attempt appears to tavotSn nSde to convert then, to the principle, of Wahab.sm. 7 The main focus of disagreement with Ibn Sa'ud during these two years was the position and rightful allegiance o the Dahamshah tribe, a section of the Amarat Amzah. * tribe was claimed by Ibn Hadhdhad (the paramount shaikh of the Amarat) as subject to him, and by Ibn Sa ud as subject to Naid Meanwhile the policy of the Government, certain onlv that the tribe belonged to 'Iraq, vacillated between the tl erf rendering .t dependent responsible to Government. The death of rahad Hadhdhad in 1927 gave a further opportunity for indecision. 8 The situation in the Dahfir was likewise unsabsfactory. Hamud as Suwait, who was constantly m dl ^ CU ^ S b ^ r ^ 926 Government, succumbed to consumption m f ec ?^^ n His nephew and successor, Ajaimi, exposed to g Akhwan attacks and afforded no material support by the Traq Government, was naturally forced to compound with Naid to avoid as he feared, the destruction of himse f and his following. Ancient hostility between the ^hamshah and the Dhafir (revived and given direction, no doubt by^the ^ve } of the latter) showed itself in a series of raids and t c ^ te r-' aid J; These in themselves were not of great unportan , . view of Ibn Sa'ud's claim to the allegiance of the Dahamshah, were calculated to complicate the issue still further. 9. Throughout the period under review, no policy 0 J con solidation and defence of the tribes was undertaken with the exception of the ill-advised formation of a camel corps ear &gt; in 1922 (which was speedily destroyed by Akhwan with the connivance or assistance of the Dhafir) and the establishment of the advanced post at Abu Ghar mentioned above. Occurrences on the Iraq side of the frontier were treated as a series of incidents, connected perhaps by a line of aggressive policy, but opposed by no connected scheme of defence. Aircraft and armoured cars patrolled to a considerable distance5 from their bases at Shaibah or Nasiriyah in times when a raid was believed to be imminent or was known to have occurred, but, with the exception of the garrison at Abu Ghar no 'Iraqi force or official penetrated the desert. The whole of the work of rallying the tribes fell upon the Special Service Officers, whose responsibilities increased with their experience. It was not possible, however, for any single S.S.O. to give his undivided attention to this problem except for a short period during the winter months. 10. Subsequent to the re-occupation of Abu Ghar Post, it became apparent that the construction of a new post further south would offer considerable advantages both as an ' intelli gence ' centre for tribal information, and for the more effective control of the shepherd tribes during their annual winter migration. In addition, the establishment of such posts in the desert was undertaken by the Iraq Government in response to a request from H.M. Government that they should consider the best means of preventing raiders from Syria crossing 'Iraq territory to raid into Xajd. Ibn Sa'ud had complained of such raids and stated that he held the Iraq Government responsible for them. After the raid into Kuwait on the 5th October, 1926, a small detachment of camel police was sent to camp at the wells at Husaiya which had been used bv the raiders on their return. In order to check further raids this detach ment was maintained, and in February, 1927, the construction of a small fortified post was commenced. 11. In September of the same year (1927), alarmist rumours were in circulation south of the frontier relative to this new post at Busaiya ; its size and strength were grossly exaggerated and credence was given to the story that a branch line was to link it with the Baghdad—Basrah railway. The resentment aroused by this attempt to establish law and order in the Southern Desert culminated in the fulfilment of Faisal ad Dawish s threat to destroy the post and thus ensure the freedom of the desert and the security of the Akhwan faith from the insidious approach of a Western civilization. ATTACK ON BUSAIYA POST. 12. On the night of the 5th/6th November, 1927, the post was attacked by a party of Mutair estimated at 40 strong. All the occupants of the post were killed with the exception of one policeman who made good his escape and reported the occurrence to the post at Abu Ghar, and one found wounded next day. By the time the report got through to Shaibah, it was too late to locate the raiders by air, though a flight was6 sent out to search. The raiders, however, unhampered by )oot, had made good their escape beyond the frontier. At the time of this attack the post has not been completely built owing to difficulties in getting materials out into the desert. Of the 21 people slaughtered on this occasion, jeven were police and the remainder were employed on the construction of the post. The post itself was not damaged. EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE FORMATION OF AKFORCE. 13. Following the attack on Busaiya, considerable uneasiness was evident in the South Western Desert, and numerous requests for reconnaissances and demonstrations were received. As a result of this, one Flight of No. 84 (B) Squadron and two Sections Armoured Car Wing, were based on Abu Ghar under the command of Squadron Leader F. J. Vincent, D.F.C. 1 wo Victorias of No. 70 (B) Squadron were sent to Shaibah to maintain supplies for this Force, which was known as ' Vincol. ' Busaiya was re-occupied on 18th November by police, and a working party escorted by one of the car sections from Abu Ghar. Twenty-nine coolies were flown from Abu Ghar to Busaiya on that day to enable work on reconstruction of the fort and defences to commence without delay. On the 23rd a second car section moved from Abu Ghar to Busaiya and on the 24th the Flight there was withdrawn to Shaibah. 14. On the 4th December a small raid by Mutair took place near Jal-al-Yah against Kuwait tribes. Following this a request was received on 13th December from the Shaikh of Kuwait for air reconnaissances to be carried out over Kuwait territory. The question was referred to H.M. Govern ment, who replied on the 30th December that the request should be acceded to as far as possible, but no bombing should be undertaken over Kuwait territory. 15. On the 9th December an air patrol was fired on near Umm al Abid, in the neutral area, by a party of about 300 camelmen and horsemen who were moving southward. Fire was returned by the aircraft, but the Wireless Operator was badly wounded by the first volley and the fight was broken off while the machines landed to render first aid. It subse quently transpired that this party had carried out a raid a few hours previously on 'Iraqi tribes at Jiraibiyat. At this time permission had not been given for us to cross the frontier in pursuit of raiders. The action took place 20 miles from the frontier, and, owing to the wounding of the W/T operator no report could be made until the aircraft reached Busaiya.0 Consequently no further air action could be taken against the raiders that day. Air reconnaissances on the following day found the area deserted. 16. On the 14th December, permission was received from H.M. Government, to pursue any Akhwan, if caught raiding in 'Iraq, across the Najd border. 17. On the 16th December, work on the construction of the fort and defences at Busaiya was completed. On the 15th and 16th a Platoon of the 'Iraq Army, complete with reserve ammunition and rations, was flown from Nasiriya to Busaiya. The two car sections were withdrawn from Busaiya to Basrah on the 18th. On the 20th December, the garrison of Abu Ghar was withdrawn and the post abandoned. This post was in a bad state of repair, and in view of the occupation of Busaiya by a military force, was no longer necessar)^. 18. On the 26th December reports were received and subse quently confirmed, that another Akwan raid on a large scale had taken place on 17th December, near Jumaimah. Here again the raid took place near the frontier, and by the time the news came through, the raiders had got well across the frontier. 19. After the attack on Busaiya post the 'Iraq shepherd tribes were warned to withdraw from the frontier zone behind the line Magritha-Baraibich-Busaiya. The tribes raided on December 9th and 17th had disregarded this warning, prefer ring to take the risk of being raided rather than leave the good grazing areas near the frontier. The difficulties of protecting the 'Iraqi tribes under such circumstances are obvious. On the other hand, these tribes depend on the desert grazing to maintain their flocks, and it is obviously unfair to deny them their means of subsistence if this can possibly be avoided. 20. It was now abundantly clear that Ibn Sa'ud was either unable or unwilling to prevent his tribes raiding, and the 'Iraq Government could no longer permit their subjects to be killed without doing all that was possible to protect them. With this end in view it was essential that steps should be taken to prevent any raiders from approaching the frontier if possible, and to inflict severe punishment on any raiders should they evade our precautionary measures. The High Commissioner proposed a warning to Ibn Sa'ud that if he did not manage within six weeks to restrain his tribes, the Najd and Hasa coasts would be blockaded. H.M. Government preferred to take measures beyond the Najd frontier by aeroplanes, and on 3rd January, 1928, directed that air action should be taken beyond the frontier against the Najd tribes.8 21 The Air Forces in the Command at this period were . No. 6 (A Co-op.) Squadron (Bristol Fighter) at Mosul ; No. 30 (Bombing) Squadron (D.H.9.A.) at Hinaidi ; No. 55 (Bombing) Squadron (D.H.9.A.) at Hinaidi ; No. 70 (Bombing) Squadron (Victoria) at Hinaidi, No. 84 (Bombing) Squadron (D.H.9.A.) at Shaxbah, and seven Sections of Armoured Cars, of which one was due for disbandment by 31st March. Of these, one Section was at Mosul, one at Kirkuk, and one at Basrah. At this time the general situation in the rest of 'Iraq was quiet, except that trouble in the Barzan District, about 70 miles north-east of Mosul was expected. While there was a possibility of trouble in that district it was not possible to withdraw any forces from the Mosul area ; in fact, in Feburary it was necessary to send additional ground forces there. FORMATION OF AKFORCE. 22. On 8th January, an Advanced Headquarters, called ' Akforce,' was formed at Ur Junction under the command of the Chief of Staff, Air Commodore T. C. R. Higgins, C.B., C.M.G. The forces at his disposal were located as follows : Buscol at Busaiya. —Under the command of Squadron Leader H. A. Whistler, D.S.O., D.F.C., consisting of nine aircraft of No. 55 (B) Squadron, and two Sections of armoured Car W ing. Nucol, at Sulman. —Under the command of Squadron Leader F. J. Vincent, D.F.C., consisting of nine aircraft and two Sections Armoured Cars. A Supply Column called Supcol. —I nder the command of Wing Commander H. R. Nicholl, O.B.E., consisting of No. 70 (B) Squadron at Ur, with a mechanical transport column at Samawa. Shaibah Details—Under the command of Squadron Leader H. A. Peck, D.S.O., M.C., consisting of the remainder of Nos. 55 and 84 (B) Squadrons, with the reserves for the Armoured Car Wing at Basrah. 23. The operations of Akforce resolved themselves into three phases ;— x XT . . (i) First Phase.—The warning and driving back of r^ajd tribes from the vicinity of the Iraq—Najd Border from Kuwait in the east up to the Wadi A1 Khurr in the west. (ii) Second Phase. —Operations against actual raiding parties. (iii) Third Phase— The steps taken to keep watch and ward during the period subsequent to the February raid up to and during the Jaddah Conference.0 FIRST PHASE. 24. In order to prevent raiders crossing the frontier it was necessary to drive the Najd tribes back from their grazW areas near the frontier, just as the 'Iraqi tribes had been arnrT /rnm ^ heir S razm £ b y ^ar of raids. This was necessary apart from denying good grazing to the Nejdis, in order to prevent raiders from concealing themselves among peaceful encampments. With this object in view, plans we?e%repared theTesert ^ The ^^ed cars f r o m advanced bases in the desert. 1 he general plan of operations was to have a Force Headquarters at Ur Junction with aircraft operating from advanced bases at Busaiya and Sulman, each advanced tese to be protected by two Sections of armoured cars. The aircraft were to sweep the country up to the border and for a distance of 70 miles beyond it, clear of all Najd tribes. The original intention was to push these advanced bases forward as the areas were cleared, but, owing to the difficulties of finding to hi e g roi ; nds near a good water supply, and owing to bad weather making it essential to erect tents etc a? Buaaiya and Sulman, those places were used as permanent advanced bases throughout the operations. TeZ^v for^diys a^afire' 1113 fUrther OUt USed leftUr T nn e ^ Shaibah ' ^ those for Sulman sent out ThP January.

As punishment for this offence h * 1 an aq ^vernments hereby order that all' Najd tribes must retreat to a distance of four days' march from the 'Iraq frontier. Any persons who disobey tSs furtlier^arning/ ^ ^ ^ the ^hou? trihL By the l8 . th warnin g notices had been dropped on all Seen U P to the line Birkat Ashabah-Lina-Hafar and10 eastwards up to the Kuwait frontier. The general attitude of the tribes at first was to act in accordance with instructions. After a few days, however, it became necessary to show more forcibly that we were in earnest. Consequently, when tribes, who had been warned one dav to move were found in the same place on the following day, warning bombs were dropped clear of their encampments. If this was insufficien , : n ; lire d stock were shot. In no case was any personnel injured. Between the 18th and 28th warning bombs were dropped on fifteen occasions. These measures considerably heartened the 'Iraqi tribes who began to move out again towards the frontier where they could get better grazing. 28 In addition to the tribes in the area mentioned above, the Akhwan menace had exerted considerable influence on the powerful^ Amarat Section of the Anizeh tribe, whose norma habit is from the south-east corner of the Syrian IJesert bordering on the Euphrates from Karbala to above Hit an iTsummer as far westwards as the Wadi Hauran. At the end of December, Mahrut. the Shaikh of the Amzeh, approached the High Commissioner with a request that armoured cars and aeroplanes should be sent to be with him for sometime tribe wtsiu., to beinu raided In view of the operations being undertaken by Akforce it was impossible to comply with this ^ officer was sent to visit Mahrut, however, on the ^ January to explain to him the action which was being tak restored a certain amount of composure in him, ™th the result that his people began to move down to the Lussuf area. \ isi by a Flight of No. 30 (B) Squadron from Hinaidi to Lussuf on the 13th and 28th January provided further evidence that th interests were not being overlooked. 29. On 22nd January, Air Commodore Higgins handed over command of Akforce to Wing Commander E ^ J-^nson. D.S.O., A.F.C., and resumed his duties as Chief Staff Omc , Air Headquarters. SECOND PHASE. 30 Early in the morning of 27th January, a party of Akhwan estimated at two to three hundred strong, carried out a raid on Kuwait tribes in the vicinity of Shiqqat ar Ruwaisat. a 70 miles S.W. of Basrah. News of this raid was received in11 C9 Kuwait that evening. The Shaikh promptly commandeered all available cars and sent them out to try and cut off the raiders. In this they were successful and a'lively action took place near A1 Riqai on the evening of the 28th, in which both sides sustained a number of casualties, and the raiders had to abandon part of their loot. Information regarding this raid was not received by Akforce from Kuwait until the following morning. Aircraft were sent out to search, but, owing to lack of information regarding the movements of the raiders, were unable to establish touch, On the following morning a formation of Buscol aircraft located and attacked them 15 miles north east of Hafar. This party consisted of about 40 men who opened fire on the aircraft as soon as they came within range. Shortly after this action had been broken off, the Flight Leader was forced to land about five miles north of the raiders. The crew were rescued b\ the remaining aircraft and after removing the gun locks and ammunition, the forced landed aircraft was abandoned. On the following morning two formations of six aircraft each set out to search the Hafar area for the remainder of the raiders The Nucol Flight located them first about eight miles west of Hafar and immediately reported their position by wireless to the Buscol formation. Casualties were inflicted on the raiders, who opened fire on the aircraft as soon as they were within range. During the course of the engagement one D.H.9A was forced to land about 400 yards from the raiders after being shot through the radiator. The pilot, who was alone, salved his gun locks and ammunition, and was rescued under fire by Flight Lieutenant J. F. T. Barrett. iJ.r.C. hor this and other remarkably good work during the operahons Flight Lieutenant Barrett was subsequently awarded Shortly after the Nucol formation had broken their engagement, the Buscol formation appeared on the scene finding the raiders in scattered confusion. Further casualties were inflicted, although, owing to the dispersal of the raiders, targets were small and difficult to locate. Nothing r Was Seen of these raiders b y further reconnaissances. Ut the two aircraft abandoned on this occasion one was subse quently salved and flown back to its base, and the other was burnt as it was not considered possible to salve it. 31 I his raid brought out the necessity of maintaining a c oser liaison with Kuwait. Occasionally air reconnaissances were earned out over Kuwait territory (see para. 14 above) out little could be done in this way while Buscol and Nucol were engaged in driving the Najd tribes back from the frontier y m February the Special Service Officer, Basrah, and an experienced Armoured Car Officer, were sent to confer with12 -i&gt; t * - i A&lt;T&lt;»nf TCiiwfl.it rccardinK collation of intelligence and^o-o^radon between aircraft ami circumstances again arise similar to those of ^8th Janua y. experience STaS on? th^prev^us raids! 'by denying them goal a inflirtinp' casualties on them should thc\ o caught'raiding. It was extremely difficult for p^ots to dis- SnateMutlirfrom Harb, 'ar or Dhafir all of whom had elements scattered about south of the border, therefore decided not to press the action taken and after February 2nd no more warnings or bombs e dropped. The policy now adopted was (a) To maintain a watch over the 70 miles zone south of K frontier (b) T ^prevent Mutair from using this area if possible. S To discourage other Najd tribes from remaining m { ) this area, but not to take any action against then unless they showed signs of hostility or harboure raiders. 33 The first result of this modification it was unnecessary to keep more than one Flight at u and Busaiya, enabling the remaining two Fhghtsfromean Sst to be brought in to Shaibah where they could be better maintained and would constitute a concentrated stn ing force for use where required. , 4 Rum ours of the approach of a further raid were received from tribes in the neutrll area on the 16th Febrnary. On the same dav the Shaikh of Kuwait asked that reconiia^sances over his' territory should be maintained as he ^strong reasons for expecting a raid. I he permission o .. ^ ment to fiv over Kuwait territory {tee para. 14) had now Dee extended to include operations from bases in Kuwait in vie of the definite threat of aggression by Akh ^n agamst Kuw itself. Arrangements were accordingly put in train for sending a Flight and some armoured cars to be based on m - H M.S. ' Emerald ' proceeded to Kuwait on 17th et y. On the 17th and 18th further rumours of an tended raid on Kuwait were received. Unfortunately the weather was ven- bad on the 16th. 17th and 18th, low clouds and ^ad visibility considerably hampering air reconnaissances, moved out to its temporary advanced base at Rukhaimiya o the 18th.13 35. The raid took place on the 19th, in the neighbourhood of Jarishan. Apparently the raiders left Es Safa on the 14th, and reached Umm al Amara on the 17th, where Faisal al Dawish made his headquarters, and sent out spies to seek a favourable objective. The main party or raiders left on the 18th, and marching all through the night, carried out the raid at dawn next morning, Faisal himself remaining at his head quarters. 36. The first touch gained by air was by a formation which left Shaibah early on the 19th and had flown down to Jahra and then turned westwards, locating Dawish's headquarters. This was attacked with good effect, but the leader's aeroplane was shot through the petrol tank and the action had to be broken off while repairs were effected. On receipt of reports from this formation, aircraft were immediately sent out from Shaibah and Busaiya and Nucol aircraft were ordered to Busaiya. The next flight from Shaibah, on its way to Al Riqai located the main party of raiders, south of Jarishan. These were subsequently attacked by three formations during the day. A Section of armoured cars was sent out from Shaibah, and one of the Sections from Rukhaimiya was sent towards Hafar to endeavour to cut off the raiders should they use that route. 37. On the following day attacks were continued on the retreating raiders in the area east of Al Batin from Abraj al Hubari to Umm al Hamir. In one of these attacks, a D.H.9A was shot down, and the pilot, Flying Officer Jackson, was killed. A later reconnaissance was able to pick up the body and take it in to Basrah. During the day the raiders were engaged with good effect by seven formations of aircraft. Armoured cars, which were co-operating with aircraft south east of Al Riqai, captured a wounded Mutair on the 21st, who stated that the main body of raiders had got away to the southward and would probably concentrate at Es Safa to distribute the loot. No further touch was gained with the raiders on the 22nd. 38. On the afternoon, 23rd, twelve D.H.9As. and three Victorias were concentrated at Rukhaimiya to carry out an attack on Es Safa. A refuelling base was established at Al Hafar, guarded by one section of armoured cars. In spite of very strong winds the attack on Es Safa was successfully carried out on the 24th. About 20 miles north of Es Safa a large camp, similar to that identified as al Dawish's near Al Riqai on the 19th, was found and was attacked by half the formation, while the remainder went on to Es Safa. This was found to consist of three wells, one mud fort, and about14 ten mud houses, also a large tent, with men, camels and horses all around them. This target was attacked with good effect the tent amongst other things being demolished. All aircraft returned safely to their bases. 39. On receipt of the news of the raid on the 19th, a Section of armoured cars was already on its way to Kuwait to form a base there. This Section was diverted to take part in the pursuit of the raiders, and the establishment of a base at Kuwait had to be postponed until 27th February, when one Flight, and a Section of cars were sent there. 40. Naval landing parties had already been landed from H M.S. ' Emerald ' to help man the defences of the town. H.M. Ships ' Crocus ' and ' Lupin ' were also sent to Kuwait to assist in the defensive measures if required. 41 This brings to a close the second phase of the operations. No further raids materialised after this in spite of rumours of large concentrations and combinations of Akhwan tribes other than Mutair with the alleged intention of waging a holy war against all non-Akhwan tribes. Whatever other reasons may be asserted for this, there can be no doubt that the Mutari, at this time, were in no spirit for further extensive aggression after the punishment they had just received. THIRD PHASE. 42 On 24th February, the Shaikh of Kuwait received a message from Ibn Sa'ud to the effect that Faisal ad Dawish had got completely out of his control. 1 he messengers also stated that they had heard that all Akhwan were now joining in with ad Dawish in a regular Jehad against all non-Akhwan, and that Ibn Sa'ud had been compelled to associate himself with the movement. 43. There are four principal Akhwan tribes, the Mutair, whose habitat is generally north of Riyadh and round Artawiya and Safa; the 'Ataibah, who live to the south and west of Riyadh ; the 'Ajman, who live not far from the coast between Hofuf and Kuwait; and the Harb, who are to be found between Hail and Riyadh. It is not the custom of the Bedouin tribes to cross the country of another tribe when undertaking ci raid if this can be avoided. Consequently it might be expected that the Mutair would continue to operate, as during the first four months, towards Busaiya and in the neighbourhood of the Kuwait-Traq frontier. The 'Ataibah seemed likely to move west of the Mutair, through Lina and Lauqa towards Sulman and Shabicha. The activities of the 'Ajman were not so clear, but their geographical situation made it likely15 that they would raid the tribes in Southern Kuwait, round Jahra, and possibly attempt an attack on Kuwait itself. 1 he Harb were believed to be the most loyal to Ibn Sa'ud and were likely to be the last to break loose from his control. In the past they have raided up the Wadi Sirhan towards Amman, and they might attack the Anaizah near Rutbah. 44. If there was any truth in these rumours we might have to deal with forces of anything up to 50,000 men, though it was unlikely that individual raiding parties would exceed 4,000 owing to difficulties of water supplies, etc. These might launch attacks on Kuwait, Basrah, the Basrah-Baghdad railway, Karbala and Najaf, the Anaizah tribe, or on Amman, Ma'an, or Akaba. In addition the trans-desert route from Transjordan to Baghdad would become exposed to attack. Our intelligence at the time discredited the likelihood of such a combination, or that Ibn Sa'ud, as far as our evidence went, would definitely sanction large scale attacks on 'Iraq. It was, however, still doubtful to what extent he was responsible for the series of small raids previously carried out by the Mutair. Although no confirmation of this report could be obtained, the difficulty of finding out what was really happening in Najd made it impossible to ignore the possibility of attacks in considerable strength. Public opinion, too, was very exercised by alarmist reports of the proclamation of a holy war which was given much prominence in the Press. 45. The first step taken to meet this situation was to reinforce Akforce by a Flight of No. 30 (B) Squadron and a section of armoured cars from Hinaidi on 29th February, this section being replaced at Hinaidi by the section from Kirkuk. A new section of armoured cars was formed at Hinaidi from reserves in the Command and was completed by 9th March. Arrange ments were made for one Flight of Victorias of No. 216 (B) Squadron to be held in readiness to proceed to 'Iraq from Heliopolis if required. 46. On the 5th March, an armoured train, manned by a detachment of the 3rd/5th Mahratta Light Infantry, arrived at Ur for use on the Ur-Basrah line. Arrangements were made by the 'Iraq Government to persuade the 'Iraqi tribes to withdraw behind the line Jarishan-Busaiya-Sulman-Shabicha. 47. On 18th March, two companies of the 'Iraq Army left Samawa to occupy the wells at Shabicha, arriving there on the 25th. During their march, aircraft and cars co-operated with them, the cars being based on Shabicha from the 22nd. This was necessary for the purpose of stabilising the Anaizah, some of whose sections were camped in the A1 Jil area, while Mahrut16 was still at Lussuf. On 24th March, a section of armoured cars was sent to Lussuf and remained with Mahrut for a week, carrying out reconnaissances of the surrounding country. 48. The month of March passed without further evidence of a Jehad materialising. At the end of the month, however, persistent rumours of an impending raid by 'Ataibah, possibly supported by Mutair and Harb, were in circulation. There appears no doubt that a large party of 'Ataibah under ibn Humaid advanced as far as Niqqa el Jarrab, where they were probably visited by emissaries from the Mutair and Harb. This party did not finally disperse until after the meeting with Ibn Sa'ud (see para. 49). Messengers from Riyadh had previously attempted to persuade ibn Humaid to disband the party, and it was probably their intervention which prevented its advance beyond this point. Air reconnaissances on the 31st March and 1st April reported the Lina area to be deserted ; the few tribesmen seen stated that the tribes had moved westward on receipt of warning of the approach of a large raid which was to water at Lina. Information from other sources pointed to the possibility of a raid developing against the Anaizah. Aircraft visited Shaikh Mahrut at Lussuf on the 2nd April, and warned him of this possibility. 49. On the 4th April information was received that Ibn Sa'ud had agreed to meet a representative of H.M. Government at Jeddah. It was also reported that he had summoned the leading representatives of the 'Ataibah, Mutair, and Harb to meet him in the vicinity of Buraida before leaving for Jeddah. By the 10th it was evident that, had there been a general concentration of Akhwan in preparation for a raid, it had now dispersed. Air reconnaissances had reported a gradual filtration of tribes back to the Lina area. In view of the general improvement of the situation air reconnaissances were cut down to a minimum and a gradual reduction in the detachments in the desert was commenced. On the 11th April, a newly formed Armed Ford Company of the 'Iraq Army arrived at Lussuf, where it remained with the Amarat up to the end of the period under review. This company was left under the orders of the Ministry of Defence until such time as there was evidence of the intention of the Akhwan to attack the Amarat further north, when they would have been brought under the orders of Air Headquarters. 50. In the middle of April, an incident occurred which, although of small significance in itself, provided a useful example of the value of our desert organisation in controlling the tribes. On the evening of the 21st April, information was received by the police at Busaiya that a minor Shaikh ofthe Dhafir had left the vicinity of Busaiya two days previously with about 30 men to carry out a raid into Najd in the Bashuk area. It appears that they had heard that some camels previously looted from the Dhafir were grazing there with a party of Mutair. After searching on the 22nd without success, aircraft succeeded in locating this party on the following morning near Hassana before they had carried out their raid. They were ordered to return and were kept under surveillance by the aircraft until well on their way. On the morning of the 24th armoured cars, working in co-operation with the aircraft, arrested the leaders near Sama, and brought them in to Busaiya, where they were dealt with by the civil authorities. This prompt action prevented an incident which might have given rise to serious complications in the negotiations about to take place at Jeddah. 51. On the 3rd May, information was received that Ibn Sa'ud had arrived at Madinah on his way to meet Sir Gilbert Clayton at Jeddah. This was the first information received that Ibn Sa'ud definitely intended to meet the British representative. It is known that when he first offered to do so he had not met his tribesmen nor obtained from them an undertaking not to go forward with the raid for which they had assembled. Until this date no certain news of Ibn Sa'ud's meeting with the Akhwan leaders near Buraidah had been received, although it is now believed that a conference was held between 19th and 23rd April, at which, however, neither Faisal ad Dawish nor Sultan ibn Humaid were present in person. As it was now evident that he had come to some sort of arrangement with his tribes, orders weie issued to the effect that no aircraft or cars were to cross the Najd border or to visit the neutral area. Restricted reconnaissances along the 'Iraq side of the border were still carried out. 52. On receipt of the news that the Jeddah conference had been postponed, and that Ibn Sa'ud had given a written undertaking to restrain his tribes from raiding, all Royal Air Force detachments at Kuwait, Busaiya and Sulman were withdrawn, Ur was closed down and Nos. 55 and 70 (B) Squadrons returned to Hinaidi. These movements were completed by 29th May, and on 3rd June, Akforce ceased to exist. difficulties of terrain. 53. J wish to call attention to some of the exceptional difficulties of operating over country such as the desert on the Orders of Iraq and Najd, and in doing so to pay a tribute to the way the pilots of all squadrons employed have overcome18 these difficulties. The fact that nobody was lost in spite of the deep penetration into the unsurveyed country across the 'Iraq frontier reflects the greatest credit on all the officers and men actually employed between November, 1927, and the end of April, 1928. Although the desert is not without its features, these are extremely difficult to recognise and to identify with any particular locality in the desert. A feature which, in the early morning may appear to have such well marked characteristics as to be easily remembered, will be quite unrecognisable an hour or two later owing to changes of light which will occur not only as the sun moves across the sky but as it becomes obscure or obscured by clouds and dust. It is the experience of No. 84 (B) Squadron that it takes at least a year for the average pilot to become so familiar with the desert that he can be relied upon to lead a flight across it without fear of losing his way. The other demands on the Royal Air Force in 'Iraq prevent more than one squadron being allotted to the desert area in normal times and this, with the short tour of two years, results in very few pilots at the beginning of an active period in the desert being really fit for flight leading. In consequence the reinforcing aircraft have to go slowly at first, gradually increasing their radius of knowledge from known places. When in January, permission was first received to extend air reconnaissances into Najd, little was known about that country from a flying point of view. Such maps as existed had been compiled from the notes of travellers and the degree of accuracy with which places had been marked on the map was quite unknown. It was not, therefore, until reconnaissances over Najd had been gradually extended from known places in 'Iraq, that the Royal Air Force was in a position to push these flights deep into Najd. At present attacks by aircraft on the Najd settlements, which all lie far from the frontier, could be carried out with a reasonable chance of success, but if there is a long interval before hostilities are renewed the personnel who knew the country will have left 'Iraq, and such attacks will only become possible after a considerable interval, during which pilots are acquiring knowledge of the desert. This cannot be taught theoretically, it can only be acquired by practical experience. VALUE OF TROOP-CARRYING AIRCRAFT. 54. One point, which is clearly brought out by these operations, is the great value of troop-carrying aircraft, especially for the carriage of fuel, stores, and supplies. Without such craft it w T ould have been quite impossible to have maintained, and operated, aircraft at advanced bases in19 the desert on such a scale as was successfully accomplished. As it was, it was possible to send out maintenance personnel and stores in Victorias at the same time as the operating aircraft left their main bases. At certain times of the year much of the country intervening between the main and advanced bases might be quite impassable by land. At any rate, had reliance to be placed on land transport, the operations would have been considerably delayed and complicated. USE OF ARMOURED CARS. 55. The armoured cars did most useful work although they were not successful in getting into action with any large bodies of raiders. Much of the country in the area of operations is quite unsuitable for the tactical handling of the present type of armoured car. Suggestions for an improved type have already been forwarded. Opportunities were taken, during reconnaissances, of gaining as much topographical information as possible. A map, showing areas suitable or unsuitable for the operations of armoured cars, was prepared as a result of the experience gained. (Map 3.) PROTECTION OF ADVANCED AIRCRAFT BASES. 56. When aircraft were operating from temporary advanced bases in the desert the only protection it was possible to provide for them was that given by armoured car sections, plus what they could provide for themselves. Air reconnais sances were carried out before dark, covering an area up to about 50 miles from the camp in the direction of possible aggression. This system worked successfully in practice. Actually the tribes encountered near these advanced bases were not actively hostile. If this were not the case it would probably be necessary to move the camp daily to prevent surprise attacks. 57. A report on all technical questions arising out of these operations and a list of recommendations for Honours and Awards are being forwarded under separate cover. 58. In operations of this nature it is difficult to single out individuals for Awards where all ranks have put in such excellent work under strenuous conditions. Apart from the ■ o ng flying times put in over bare and featureless desert, the obscurity of the enemy, long interval between the time of actual raid and the consequent absence of result of most of the reconnaissances, made such operations extremely monotonous for the personnel concerned. It must also be20 remembered that the flying personnel were fully aware of the fact that if they forced landed near the raiders and could not be rescued in time, they would probably be killed out of hand. The air pilotage displayed in finding their way and places over this very difficult desert, with practically no features to guide them, was of the highest order. The climatic conditions throughout the operations were extremely trying ; cold and wet, with snow at times, in the early stages, giving way later on to great heat and heavy dust storms. Under such conditions life at the advanced landing grounds was a great strain on the personnel. The fact that there was so little sickness and that the work was carried out so thoroughly says much for the efficiency of the administrative services, as well as for those who were actually doing the work at the front. 59. I wish also to call attention to the excellent work of the 'Iraq Aircraft Depot ; by careful organisation and working long hours overtime, they managed to increase their output both of aeroplanes and engines by 40 per cent.—a very fine performance.21 LIST OF APPENDICES.

Operations commenced with columns operating from Busaiya and Sulman, and later from Shabicha, with Ur as the Railhead. A Railhead Supply Section was formed under the charge of an officer of A.D. of S. &amp; T's. branch. This Section proceeded to Ur on January 6th, and established a Railhead Supply Section. Approximately ten days' supply of food, petrols, oils, medical comforts and miscellaneous commissariat items, for a strength of approximately 250 men, 26 aircraft of two types, and 46 M.T. vehicles and armoured cars was sent down with the Section. The Supply Officer was given an Imprest Account, from which fresh meat, fresh vegetables and fresh fruits were purchased as required. Winter ration butter in tins was supplied from Base Supply Depot, Basrah, as also was bread. The question of establishing a Field Bakery at Ur was considered, but owing to the prevalence of dust storms, lack of suitable accommodation and other factors, it was decided to supply from Basrah by rail. Coolie labour as required was hired on the spot. In order to avoid the holding of too many varieties of rations, with consequent difficulties and losses, it was decided to place all Officers' bearers on ration allowance. Owing to the severity of the weather, an issue of rum was approved by the Air Officer Commanding on the recommendation of the competent Medical Authority. For the operations, the standard ration for the Command was adopted, with the addition of rum as already indicated, and the tea and sugar ration for personnel with the columns was increased by 50 per cent, on account of the quality of the water available in the desert. For Ur, arrangements were made with the 'Iraq Railways to supply water on payment from their storage tanks. Electric light was also obtained from the railways on payment. 2. The Section at Ur was established by January 8th, and later a N.C.O. was detached to Samawa, from which place the Ford transport vehicles operated. Ur was chiefly supplied with all items by rail from Basrah, supplemented as necessary by rail from Hinaidi-Baghdad. Storage accommodation at Ur being very limited, storage was constructed from empty tins and drums. Empty containers not used by the forces were sold under the existing sale contract. For transport by air, wood was prepared in 12 inch lengths, this being found the most suitable size for handling and carriage.23 3. On March 5th, an Armoured Train with one British Officer and about 30 Indian troops were based on Ur. Indian rations were supplied from Basrah by rail. 4. In February, the Kuwait area became threatened, and it was necessary to despatch a small Supply Section, in charge of one Officer, to Kuwait, to cater for a small mixed column to operate therefrom. For supply this Section was based upon Shaiba and Basra, the former for stocks seiit by land transport, and the latter supplying Shaiba and for stocks sent by sea transport. An issue of rum was approved for this part of the force, otherwise subsistence was by the normal ration scale for the Command. A naval ship being located at Kuwait for the major part of the period, bread was obtained on re-payment from the Royal Navy, also drinking water. On the departure of the ship from Kuwait, bread and ice were supplied from Shaiba, and water purchased as required from the suppliers to the town, who bring drinking water from the river at Fao to Kuwait every summer, when the few wells at Kuwait practically dry up. Stocks of dry rations, petrol, oil and stores were sent on three occasions to Kuwait by the fortnightly slow Gulf mail steamer, by arrangement with the Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation, who are Agents for the British India Steam Navigation Company. Transfer of stocks from ship to store was arranged with the Mudir of Customs, Kuwait. Empty containers were used for building and domestic purposes, as many as possible were returned to Shaiba by returning transport where a better sale price existed, and the balance were disposed of at Kuwait to the best advantage. 5. The summer season beginning on March 1st, the issue of rum ceased. An issue of lime juice was authorised in lieu. For Ur, and the columns based thereon, arrangements were made for ice to be supplied by the 'Iraq Railways Catering Department and issues of ice were approved to commence as from March 20th, an allowance also being authorised for the Indian troops. Supply of ice to Kuwait presented a difficulty. The original idea of placing an ice barge at Kuwait was found to be impracticable and arrangements were made for ice to be supplied to Kuwait from Shaiba by convoy transport. Scale of issues of ice to all operational units was approved at double the normal scales. As from 26th April, owing to the heat and the trying conditions, the scale of fresh fruit was doubled and the scale of lime juice trebled for the personnel of the convoy operating from Samawa. 6. At both Ur and Kuwait, arrangements were made with the Area Manager, N.A.A.F.I., to establish a small institute, which proved a great boon to the personnel of the force. 7. On May 16th, supply of fresh fruit became difficult. The between season had commenced and nothing was available except soft fruits which will not stand travel. Instructions were given on the advice of the competent Medical Authority, for tinned fruit to be issued in lieu of fresh fruit, and in addition an issue of concentrated orange juice at the scale of J ounce per head per week. 8. On 23rd May, orders were given regarding the evacuation of Kuwait, which was carried out by utilising the slow Gulf mail steamer returning from Kuwait to Basra on the 28th May. Certain landing ground stocks were left, otherwise all supply items returned to Base Supply Depot. 9. The foregoing gives a brief resume of Supply and Transport arrange ments for the Akforce operations. Throughout the whole period, there was no failure in supply at any point.10. Comment. —(a) In small operations such as these, it is not practicable to have any fixed arrangements beforehand, so much depends in Supply and Transport work upon various factors such as strengths, numbers of separate columns or formations, supply facilities, and localities involved. Provided, however, ample time is given by the directing staff, arrange ments can well be made to meet particular requirements. (b) For desert operations, or anywhere else where the water supply is poor, a substantial increase in the tea, sugar and milk ration is necessary. Increases also in the scales for fresh fruits, provision of rum or cocoa or lime juice according to season are also necessary. This, however, is governed by regulations, and on the advice of the competent Medical Authority the Air Officer Commanding has power to fix operational scales. {r) Ice supply offers difficulties, but ' dug outs ' made before hot weather commences provide good storage. This, supplemented by ice boxes, should be ample for small operations. Supply of refrigerator waggons at railhead cannot be depended upon. (rf) Supply Officers with operating forces, must have an Imprest account from the beginning, for local purchases, hire of labour, etc. This of course is usual supply practice, where local purchase officers are not appointed, but the point is emphasised as it is necessary for operations anywhere. (e) Petrol supply in tins in hot weather is bound to show fairly high leakage if stocked in the open and exposed to the sun. ' Dug-outs,' again, would make admirable storage, or if dug-outs are not practicable, sheds built with empty containers should be made at the first opportunity. Both food items and petrol should be got under shelter as soon as possible. (/) Annoured cars on the move cannot use fresh meat rations, owing to difficulties of cooking. No fuel whatever was available. Firewood had to be flown to cars and columns wherever situated. At times petrol fires had to be used, but this was done only in cases of emergency, as it is realised it is not an economical procedure. (g) Rations were supplemented by considerable orders on N.A.A.F.I. Canteen at Ur, mainly for groceries, cigarettes and beer. The latter is very heavy for transport by air, but would seem to have been beneficial to the troops, when drinking water was so bad. APPENDIX No. 3. NOTES ON SUPPLY OF EQUIPMENT. At the commencement of operations a conference was held to decide the best method to govern the issue and accounting for stores under the peculiar conditions existing. It was decided that units should take as few spares as possible, and wireless signals would be sent for stores as required; these would take priority to all other issues from the depot. This avoided holding stocks under very unfavourable conditions in the field, as no suitable accommodation existed and weather conditions were bad. To enable a stricter supervision of stocks and issues, every request was passed from advanced sections to the local supply unit, which was 70 (B) Squadron, at Ur. A Stores Officer there checked the requests, and, as far as possible, corrected the nomenclature to identify the items and sent a signal to Air Headquarters for the items required. Great difficulty was experienced at first in identifying stores demanded. Units were split up into small sections stationed at isolated posts on the desert,26 Very large quantities of wireless stores were necessary owing to the number of new stations erected by the R.A.F 'Iraq Army and Po ice. All requirements were met from stock, augmented by supplies from Unit a Kingdom. Stocks of the following items were quickly exhausted : — Valves, V.T.IC. Valves, V.R.12B. Generators 1618. lientwood Masts. Charging sets. Aircraft spares were, in most cases, supplied from main stocks. Certain bracing plates and streamline wires were issued for Victorias which had never previously been required ; these were taken from aircraft under overhaul and replaced by air and overland mail from Home Depot. Victoria airscrews were consumed at an excessive rate, normal stocKs being absorbed in a few weeks. Replacements were flown over from Egypt. Fifty tyres and 50 tubes for aircraft were consumed. Sufficient tentage was available to supply all requirements and 64 were loaned to Ministry of Defence. Ample defence stores, i.e., barbed wire, screw pickets and sand bags were available. All the necessary summer equipment was supplied together with the material for combating the fly menace. The number of pith hats required (public clothing issue) increased con siderably, owing to the operations ; the supply was hastened from India. The following items were required immediately on forming camp . Airmen's tables. Wind indicators. Airmen's forms. Material for latrines and shelters. Hurricane lamps. Notice boards. Camp kettles. Hammers and saws. Washing basins. Water cart. Picks and shovels. Tarpaulins or waterproof covers. Ample supplies of fire extinguishers were sent to all posts. The following example of the system adopted and the rapidity with which it worked is given :— Signal received and passed to I.A.D. for ' Washers Plug o ver ,va l %e for Rolls Cars on 20.3.28.

Local purchase was tried unsuccessfully and Air Mimstry wire lessed 1230 hrs on 21.3.28. Reply from Air Ministry received 0800 hrs. on 22.3.28 stating items despatched—these were received by the next air mail. The attached schedule of weights for R.A.F. equipment proved useful when loading aircraft and M.T. vehicles. WEIGHTS OF STORES. Napiei Lion Spares.

REPORT ON STORES ACCOUNTING. In the absence of any approved procedure for Stores Accounting in War, it became necessary, at the beginning of the operations, to institute some procedure which would reduce clerical labour to a minimum, and maintain an adequate account of the expenditure of equipment and ensure that columns were supplied with the stores and equipment required without delay. The operations involved the employment of a varying number of columns operating from advanced bases, and to meet these conditions two supply bases were formed, the one at Ur Junction and the other at Shaibah. The functions of these bases were to demand, receive, and issue stores. Demands for stores required by columns were made by signal on the appropriate base, where they were consolidated and repeated to Air Headquarters, where issue action was arranged. Distribution from the supply bases to the columns in the field was effected by car or aeroplane. The accounting for these stores was dealt with by means of a separate main stock ledger known as the Akforce ledger, which was maintained by the Station Accounts, Hinaidi. Flights and Sections of Armoured Cars engaged in the operations took the field with the equipment on Inventory charge, but from then onwards the Inventories ceased to operate and all subsequent issues made by Supply bases and returns by columns were charged to this ledger. Each base maintained a Stores Inwards Book and all Stores after checking against Packing Notes were entered therein in detail. A complete record of receipts was thereby maintained. The Packing Notes were then receipted and returned to Station Accounts, Hinaidi, who checked against the Vouchers raised by the Unit issuing the Stores prior to bringing the items on Akforce ledger charge. A manuscript book showing individual columns' requirements and date of demand was also maintained. A further column gave the date on which the items were supplied to column. This book constituted a complete record of all stores asked for and issued to columns, other than ammunition, bombs, Very lights, etc., which were accounted for by the Armament Officer. Lists of Stores for columns were compiled each day showing the quantities of items and weights. The stores were checked by pilots of machines at the time of loading and the loading lists initialled as concurring in the amount shown. On off-loading stores at the columns, pilots again signed the loading lists certifying that the stores were handed over. These lists were retained by bases for future reference. All unserviceable ' A ' stores and repairable ' B ' stores were returned to the 'Iraq Aircraft Depot the appropriate vouchers being prepared. Owing to the impossibility of providing columns with copies of A.P. 1086 and the appropriate machine schedules, some difficulty was experienced in identifying the stores and spares demanded by columns—the items being frequently demanded under names known to individuals familiar with the particular aircraft or vehicle. Some delay was therefore unavoidable in these cases.29 The inclusion of a storekeeper in each of the small columns employed in these operations was considered unnecessary, and in many cases would have been impracticable. The problem is'admittedly »me difficulty and is one that is likely to recur when machines' have to operate at some considerable distance from their bases. 1 As supplies of stores could be received daily by rail at the base at ^rSnVc 01 ^ I s '°i\ 0 u rt a bl a e b)n f or equipment was available for the c . . .

A supply column, known as ' Supcol,' was formed at Ur Junction. This consisted at first of— 9 aircraft of No. 70 (B) Squadron, 6 Vickers Victorias, 3 Vickers Vernons. (subsequently the Vernons were replaced by Victorias). 12 Fords from M.T. Pool— 7 Vanettes. 5 one-ton trucks. '2. 1 he following were despatched to Ur Junction by rail on 6th January, 1928 — Ford Convoy, personnel, fuel and rations to form a Supply Dump. One Crossley tender, one Ford vanette for No. 70 (B) Squadron. Tents (160 lb.). Spare engines, two Lions and two Libertys. Xote. —No. 55 (B) Squadron forwarded two boxes of spares to Ur. No. 84 (B) Squadron forwarded two boxes of spares to Ur. No spares were sent for armoured cars. 3. The following proceeded to Ur Junction on the 8th January, 1928, by air:— 9 aircraft of No. 70 (B) Squadron. Each aircraft carried full crew, plus additional personnel including A.O.C. Akforce, flight N.C.O.s, armourers, stores personnel, cooks. Stores consisting of spare airscrews, wheels, tyres, sheerlegs and tackle, tailskid trolley, Victoria and Lion engine spares for about two weeks' work, were also taken by air. 4. Fuel, oil and rations were to be held at Ur, but owing to proximity of railway, all other stores were to be demanded from Baghdad as required! 5. A limited stock of bombs was available at Nasiriya, about 10 miles from Ur. 6. S.A.A. and Liberty engine spares were at first available at Shaibah. 7. Ford Convoy left Ur for Sulman on 9th January, 1928. Owing to a gale they were only able to proceed a few miles. The cars were in danger of being blown over. Convoy arrived at Sulman early on llth January, 1928, with about 1,000 gallons fuel and returned to Samawa. 8. Aircraft were unable to work on 9th January, owing to gale. On 10th January, four days' rations and 4,000 gallons fuel were flown to Buscol. 9. Nucol was established as soon as the armoured cars arrived there. Rations and 3,900 gallons fuel were flown there by 13th January, 1928. 10. It was decided to maintain each main base with the following:— 6 days' rations, 4,000 gallons fuel, 2 complete refills of 20 lb. bombs, 2 complete refills of '303 for Ninak Squadron, 1 complete refill of •303 for armoured cars.31 minimum stocks were held at Ur :— .. 2 week's supply. .. 1 weeks' supply. .. 3 complete refills for 9A Sqdns. •. 2 complete refills for Armoured Car Section or about 5 refills for Ninaks. 12. Advanced Bases were selected for the Columns as under Buscol at Rukhaimiya, 60 miles from Bvsaiya and 120 miles from Ur. Nucol at Aqubba, 63 miles from Sulman, 158 miles from Ur. And, later Shabcol at Shabicha, 60 miles from Sulman, 155 miles from Ur. 13. Both columns moved to their advanced bases on 19th January, 1928. Aircraft from Supcol accompanied the Ninaks proceeding forward. 14. By returning to Main Base and doing a second trip to advanced base the same day, sufficient fuel and rations were delivered to provide a margin of safety. 15. Ninak Squadrons required from 450 gallons minimum to 900 gallons maximum fuel per day. 16. Once the Advanced Base was established, supplies were maintained direct from Ur. The reasons for this were :— (1) It was desirable to leave supplies at Main Bases as a reserve. 1 his might be required in case of active operations. It might be necessary to use this reserve in case of failure of any of Supcol aircraft. In such case a reduced number available might be unable to maintain supplies from Ur direct. (2) Both Main Bases at Busaiya and Sulman were very heavy landing grounds. To take off from these places with heavy loads was therefore inadvisable. As large a load could be carried to Advanced Bases direct from Ur as could be taken (with reduced fuel in tanks) from the Main Bases. (3) Victorias if refuelling at Main Bases would deplete reserves very rapidly. 17. Supplies were maintained at Advanced Bases so as to have a minimum of one complete refill for Ninak Squadron always available. 18. On withdrawing from Advanced Bases the small stock of fuel was buried. Ihis was then available for aircraft or cars visiting the Advanced Bases thereafter, while on reconnaissance. The fuel was found not to nave been touched by any local tribesmen. A small stock was also very helpful when the columns moved forward again. a Convoy could not be used for the Advanced Base at Aqubba owing to unsuitable ground between Sulman and Aqubba and the necessity of maintaining supplies at Sulman. 20. During the period over 1,000,000 lb. of stores were transported lorward by air. At the most intensive period the supply required averaged a tons per day. 6 21. It was necessary to take a short view of the likely duration of the Wtions throughout. This entailed extra work, numerous signals and other difficulties of supplv, which would doubtless have been avoided otherwise. 11. The following Fuel Rations .. Bombs .. •30332 '22. Endurance of Supcol Aircraft. (a) Full endurance of a Victoria is seven hours. (b) One hour s margin of fuel was always carried. Specimen as under :— Time out Fuel carried. Place. and back. Galls.

Shabcol was mostly 6 hours—350 gallons. (d) There was only one case of a machine landing short of petrol. This was on the Es Safa bomb raid. For this raid the estimate was :— Time out 2 hours. Time back 2 hours. Time bombing ^ hour— 4^ hours. Tanks were filled for six hours. Owing to encountering gale, the actual time was :— Victoria 7924—5 hrs. 50 mins. Victoria 8227—5 hrs. 40 mins. Victoria 7925 was slightly behind and afraid of running out of fuel, so landed near cars at Hafar to refuel. {e) All Supcol aircraft carried rations and water for three days on every trip. If compelled to land they could therefore afford to be left unattended for that time in case of emergency, such as active operations being in progress. 23. Loading. (a) Loading sheets were instituted. They were primarily intended to prevent overloading. They were later adopted as a check for stores delivered. {b) Loading sheets were made out in duplicate for each trip. One copy was left at column. (c) The full load available, winter scale, for a Victoria with full tanks and desert equipment was 1,750 lb. {d) With sufficient margin of fuel in tanks, full loads available were (winter scale) :— Buscol (Busaiya) Nucol (Sulman) Rukhaimiya .. Aqubba A1 Hafar Shabcol (Shabicha) 3,200 lb. 2,990 lb. 2,500 lb. 2,100 lb. 2,100 lb., refuelling at Buscol. 2,300 lb. . ( g ) In order to ensure reliability, loads were kept as far as possible .'&gt;00 lb. under full load available. This allowed also for increasing the endurance if necessary, at the last minute, without having to cut down the load.33 (/) A typical load of fuel was as follows ;— 56 tins of petrol—224 gallons 10 drums of benzol—50 gallons 5 drums of oil—25 gallons 1,680 lb. 500 lb. 300 lb. 2,480 lb. (g) Rations (including wood fuel) were reckoned at 8 lb. per man per day. (A) After 21st March ice was supplied at 5 lb. per man per day. (t) Water, when required, was calculated at approximately 1 gallon per man per day. (;') On routine runs to Main Bases, all rations, fuel, stores, canteen goods, passengers, were usually carried in one machine. (k) When supplying Advanced Bases or cars, the rations, fuel, water, were divided equally between machines in case of failure. 24. Organisation. (а) The general lay-out at Ur was convenient, since though small consignments had to be off-loaded at the station and transported a long way round by road, consignments of one truck load or more, were shunted on to the spur, close to Supcol Camp. (б) The principle of keeping the off-loading point clear was strictly observed, all stores being moved at once to subsidiary dumps. (c) Two main dumps were formed, one for each flight of No. 70 (B) Squadron. (d) Aircraft were parked in two flights on opposite sides of the camp. (e) Small dumps of petrol, benzol, oil, were formed at each aircraft parking place. (/) Aircraft could be parked facing north or south according to the wind. If there is more than one flight they should be separated three to four hundred yards apart and be parked line abreast. Room should be left round parking places to turn machines round and taxi. Fuel dumps should be put out by parking place of each machine ready for quick loading and available for filling. Dumps should be kept low in height so that machines running over their dumps will not damage their ailerons or king posts. Machines should never be allowed to halt with planes over petrol dump, in case of fire. When possible aircraft should take off in sequence from a flank in order to avoid blowing dust over other aircraft. (g) It was intended to work— Buscol ' A ' Flight (5 aircraft). Nucol ' B ' Flight (4 aircraft). In practice this was frequently interrupted to meet the requirements of the moment. Also pilots were sent to all places, as soon as practicable, so as to learn the country and the landing grounds. (A) During the first period of winter months, loading sheets were made out over night, and aircraft were loaded at dawn. All ranks had breakfast before leaving. (C14279) c34 (t) When hot weather set in aircraft were loaded over night, except for fresh rations and ice. They took off at dawn, not only on account of the heat, but the necessity of getting the work done before dust storms started. (j) Only alterations of an urgent nature were permitted in loading on the morning of departure. 25. Ford Convoy. (a) It was intended to supply Nucol fuel principally by road. Ihe road from Ur was impracticable ; after the first trip the convoy worked from Samawa. This was about 65 miles by road. (b) After Nucol was first reduced, the stock of fuel rose to over 8,000 gallons. The convoy was therefore reduced on 8/2/28. (c) On 20/2/28 convoy left Samawa and proceeded to Shaibah, being urgently required for fuelling Kowait. (d) On 21/3/28 Nucol had become active again, and fuel stock was only 1,300 gallons. The convoy was therefore returned to Samawa, and worked from there to Sulman once more. {e) It was found by experience that the Ford Vanettes were of very little use. Their useful load from Samawa to Salman was only 12 tins of petrol—48 gallons—360 lb. The one-ton Ford trucks stood up to the work much better. (/) Fortunately where the convoy passed through the sand belt when proceeding to Sulman the belt was narrow, and there was a slight slope downwards. On returning empty, all cars had to be man handled through short spaces in this sand belt when going up hill. (g) The convoy worked with commendable regularity under very severe conditions. The usual routine was^—-1 day out, 1 day back for overhaul and loading. {h) To have supplied Nucol with fuel by air only, when operations were active, in addition to work elsewhere, would have taxed Supcol aircraft to the limit. (t) From January to 31st May, the convoy carried the following quantities to Nucol:— Petrol. Benzol. Oil. 25,960 galls. 4,980 galls. 2,335 galls. Total weight carried, 148 tons. APPENDIX No. 7. WATER SUPPLIES. 1. Drinking water was supplied at Ur by railways in a cylindrical tank of 2,000 gallons. This was chlorinated by Akforce Medical Officer. 2. It was intended that the Main and Advanced Bases of the columns should be situated where water was available. 3. There was at first a certain supply in the Wadis whilst the rains lasted.35 ® I 4. After these had dried up, the position was as follows :— Busaiya. Sultnan. Rukhaimiya. Aqubba. Shabicha. .41 Hafar. Water available but bad taste and smell. Chemically fit. Drinking water was obtained by car from Abu Ghar, 25 miles. Water available but very saline. After the rains had stopped, it was necessary to fly about 15 gallons per dav, drinking water, to Sulman. Water available at first but not later. One gallon per man per day had to be flown out when last occupied. Water good in well 150 feet deep. Water plentiful at shallow depth, but very saline. Water available at first in deep wells. Wells were later almost filled with locusts. Water had to be flown out when cars or aircraft were stationed here. 5. I or the purpose of conveying water by air. Benzol drums were used. A stock of drums was kept ready. These were cleaned by means of— (1) Burning out the Benzol. (2) Boiling with water. (3) Washing out with strong solution of Pot. Permang. Even after this the water frequently tasted strongly of Benzol, and was very unpleasant. J At a later date Pascalls as used by Armoured Cars, were employed. 1 his was far more satisfactory and saved a lot of weight in transport but the Pascalls rapidly developed leaks. 6. I wo Sections of Armoured Cars on reconnaissances in heavy country might ask for anything from 100 to 200 gallons of water to fill up radiators and drinking supply. APPENDIX No. 8. TENTAGE AT TEMPORARY STATIONS. I . On arrival at Ur there were ten 160-lb, tents available for Supcol. The maximum accommodation in a tent was 4 officers, 8 sergeants 10 men. Sergeants and airmen slept on the ground. Vernons ^ whorn there was 110 accomm odation slept in Victorias and J;°? ly u tw °J; ents Y ere blowu dowi1 b y g ales . but the wind reached gusts of about 60 m.p.h. on the 9th January, 1928, and up to 50 m.p h on several other occasions. 3. 160-lb. tents were all right for a while and kept personnel dry at nights. 4. An I.P. tent was erected as a Hospital. (C14279) c .3(S 5. W hen weather became warm the 160-lb. tents became unbearable. They were also rather trying in dust storms. 6. I P. tents were then supplied. These were at first allotted on a basis of 5 officers, 8 sergeants, 12 airmen. 7. When the weather became really hot the tents were chappered, i.e., covered with a false roof of matting. 8. The first heat came on so rapidly about the middle of March that it was difficult to decide if the chappering were really worth while. 9. In conditions of heat the maximum number recommended by the medical officer for LP. tents was 4 officers, 5 sergeants or 6 airmen. 10. Four marquees were also provided. These have much thinner roofs than the I.P. tents and without the matting the sun would have penetrated. They were used for :— (1) C.O., Spare Room, Flight Office, General Office. (2) W/T Station and accommodation of 14 operators. (3) Airmen's Dining Room. (4) Spare, to accommodate an attached flight or Car Section, if necessary. 11. The Columns at first had no tentage and had to make the best of digging holes and sleeping under machines. The personnel were wet through most nights until 18/1/1928. 12. Some 160-lb. tents were then flown out to both Columns by Victorias. Next day the Columns moved forward, and some 160-lb. tents were also flown forward. 13. Shortly after I.P. tents were received at Ur they were also supplied for Columns and were flown to Busaiyah, Saiman and Shabicha. \n I.P. tent complete weighed 900 lb. The marquees weighed 1,200 lb. 14. Huts were constructed of petrol tins filled with earth for the following purposes :— Officers' Mess. Sergeants' Mess. Kitchens. They were roofed over with tarpaulins and proved fairly satisfactory. APPENDIX No. 9. CHANGING ENGINES ON OPERATIONS. The following are examples of what can be done by experienced pilots and crews :— 1. Date 2912128. A Victoria left Ur for Dulaimiya where a Ninak had been abandoned for several days. Liberty engine was taken from Ur. Pilot and fitter for Ninak were picked up at Busaiya. Victoria arrived Dulaimiya 1005 hours and left with old engine and crew at 1555 hours. Ninak was not quite ready. Victoria had instructions not to remain on over night as the location was exposed to hostile trioes. Crew were flown out next day and Ninak flown back.37 2. Date 5/3/28. A victoria left Shaibah at 1340 hours for Kuwait with Liberty engine, arrived Kuwait 1445 hours.

Weather conditions at Ur have been very unsettled. Gales and dust storms frequent. Owing to the size of control surfaces on Victorias wind on the tail of the machine causes a very great strain. ' r A If 4 rel j ance i s Placed upon securing the wheel and rudder bar in the cocKpit only, it is probable that some part of the control system between the contro 1 surfaces a n d the cockpit-^uch as a bell crank or king post- will, m a wind of gale force, collapse. It is essential therefore to fasten the control surfaces themselves In me case of V ictonas it is necessary to lock the ailerons, top and bottom and secure the elevators and rudders. ' 4. I here were several occasions when the wind went round 180° within a very short period and it was impossible to turn the machines round nead to wind. 5. On one occasion in a gale the ailerons of one machine worked loose resulting in a bell crank doubling up—the control wheel being lashed' two other machines were strained on this occasion, both in the aileron control system. Otherwise Victorias stood up to the weather very well.38 6. \\ hen head to wind it was found necessary to place chocks behind the wheels, and to drive pegs in behind the chocks. Otherwise the machine is inclined to drive back, and this results in strain or damage to tail skids. Tyre levers make useful pegs for driving in behind chocks. 7. After the advent of the hot weather, the effect on Victorias standing in the sun all day was noticeable. This was particularly so in the case of two machines recently received in 'Iraq and erected in the cold weather. 8. The effect of continually carrying heavy loads in the hulls of Victorias was also felt. The aeroplane is designed as a troop carrier. The weight of troops is normally taken on the seats—supported from firmer ribs of hull and not from the floor. Owing to climatic shrinkage the joints supporting the floor have in most cases shrunk and split. It has been necessary in two cases to renew these joints in order to prevent the floor collapsing. I his is a matter which requires careful watching as the controls are carried along the floor and would be affected if any collapse took place. In renewing the joints the new ones were made solid (spruce) instead of being hollowed out, this added considerably to their strength. The increase in weight was negligible. 9. In general, it was observed that owing to the absence of stones or camel thorns at Ur, the wear and tear on wheels, airscrews and tail skids was much lighter than the average at Hinaidi or other landing grounds in 'Iraq. 10. Engines have been difficult to maintain owing to the frequency of dust storms. Particular attention was paid to keeping air inlets covered, and avoid changing oil, filling tanks, or doing work on the engines when dust was blowing up. 11. Gears were difficult to inspect at correct intervals on account of the frequency of dust storms. APPENDIX No. 11. MEMORANDUM OF ARMAMENT DURING OPERATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN DESERT. November, 1927—May, 1928. GUNNERY. Vickers Guns. Owing to trouble having been experienced with speeded up guns, those used in operations were not speeded, pending the result of specific tests by No. 30 (Bombing) Squadron. All guns worked satisfactorily and no failures were reported. Lewis Guns. No trouble was experienced. General Remarks. Ow ing to constant dust due to dust storms, engines running up, aircraft taxying, etc., the question of keeping guns clean presented great difficulty. In oider to ensure that guns would fire when required, it was found necessary to fire off the gun shortly after taking off. It was generally found that stoppages occurred during the first few rounds owing to the excessive .accumulation of dust in all working parts.39 Apart from this, no failures occurred. It is interesting to note that the general opinion formed as a result of the operations, favours the use of the Lewis gun fired from the back seat to a flank as being preferable to the Vicker's gun fired by the pilot, as a method of attacking ground ' targets ' in desert operations. The principal reasons are as follows :— (I) Owing to the absence of cover, the aeroplane can be seen approach- ^ considerable distance. While attacking an objective with the front gun, a heavily loaded bombing aeroplane is itself in a very vulnerable position in that it presents a steady head-on target to rifle fire from the ground. When attacking an objective by means of a Lewis gun fired to a flank the aeroplane presents a difficult deflection shot to rifle fire on the ground. (2) as ' targets' on the ground are usually scattered over a wide area, an air gunner is in a better position to manipulate his gun and cover the whole area, than the pilot. BOMBLVG. Bombs and Bomb Carriers. Bombs were dropped on 26 separate occasions. Of these 20 were in definiU- objectives arilln8S ' ^ ^ bchlg aCtUal borabing attacks on Twenty-pound bombs were used throughout, with the exception of one occasion on which six o20-lb. bombs were dropped. An average of 5 per cent, of bombs failed to detonate. It has not been possible to inspect these and ascertain the cause. All bomb-carriers operated satisfactorily. This speaks well for the practical serviceability of the New Series 4/20-Ib dnrW w , hlc . h . f 0 P erat e d satisfactorily in spite 'of constant dust storms during which it was found impracticable to keep them properly cleaned. (There were a few cases of gate release stems breaking, as alreadv reported in the Half \ early Technical Report dated 27th April, 1928.) Fusing and Loading. Bombs once fused were marked as such and kept in stacks ready for use un return from reconnaissances unexpended bombs were removed from ^ a '; le , rs ^replaced on stacks. A considerable number of fused bombs nandlecl in this way, with no untoward occurrence. rarr, 1 advanc ^ columns it was found necessary to leave bombs on the f i C i SeS arinu ! 1 g vaiies were wi red up until the aircraft uas reaa\ to leave the ground. nf 0 . 2 ^ 1 v,' ] b ° mbs , were lifted on to the carriers in the Victorias by means of a high lift jack fitted with a cradh'. J Bomb Sights. At the commencement of operations, aircraft were fitted with bomb sights as under :— No. 70 (B) Squadron _ -Vo. 55 (B) Squadron j Course Setting Bomb Sight. No. 30 (B) Squadron \ No. 84 (B) Squadron j ' H -A.D. Sight.40 Bombing without the use of Sights. It became evident at a very early stage in the operations that no definite objective would be likely to present itself. Raiders at the first sight or sound of approaching aircraft scattered over a very wide area. It was, therefore, decided that the initiative of releasing bombs must rest with the individual pilots. Bomb release toggles were transferred from the bomb aimer's to the pilot's cockpit, and all bombing in the operations was carried out by the pilot, without the use of sights (with one exception— see below). The average height from which bombs were released was 4,000 feet. Bombing with Course Setting Bomb Sight. There was only one occasion on which a combined bombing attack was carried out on a definite objective (see para. 38 of Report— re Bombing of Es Safa). On this occasion three separate formations took part, i.e., No. 70 (B) Squadron, No. 55 (B) Squadron and No. 84 (B) Squadron. The bomb aimer of the leading fonnation (3 Victorias) using a course setting bomb sight, found wind speed and direction by the 90° method when nearing the objective, and signalled the result by wireless to the leading aircraft of No. 55 (B) Squadron formation. On reaching the objective the Victorias bombed in formation, bombs being released on sight of the bomb from the leading aircraft leaving the carrier. The D.H.9As of Nos. 55 and 84 (B) Squadrons dropped their bombs on a hand signal from the leader of No. 55 (B) Squadron formation, who was in communication with his bomb aimer by means of speaking tube. The results were very satisfactory. Full details concerning this bombing operation are given in the ' Report on Operations in the Southern Desert, November, 1927 to May, 1928.' APPENDIX No. 12. ^MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS, AKFORCE, 1928. 1. The medical personnel detailed to the force at the beginning of operations consisted of one medical officer, and N.C.O., and three nursing orderlies. The medical officer, N.C.O., and one nursing orderly remained at Ur forming a small sick quarters in an E.P.I.P. tent with the field equipment brought with them. One nursing orderly with first-aid equip ment was detailed to each of the two columns. After the first day it became apparent that further assistance was required for the sanitary side of the work, and two assistants from the Sanitary Section, Hinaidi, were posted for duty at Ur. 2. Later it was found necessary to send another medical officer to Ur so that one was always on duty at Akforce Headquarters if one was visiting the columns. After the Naval shore party left Kuwait a medical officer was sent down there owing to the isolation of the column. A nursing orderly and a sanitary assistant had been drafted to this column immediately after its formation.41 3. Medical activities during these operations may be considered under two headings:— (i) arrangements for dealing with sick and casualties (11) sanitation. (i) Sick and Casualties. Owing to some imcertainty as to the extent and duration of the operations it was considered advisable to limit this side of the work to first-aid and the treatment of only minor cases of injury or sickness, the principle of immediate evacuation of all cases liable to be non-effective for more than a ew hours being strictly adhered to. Any case requiring attention at the columns was flown to Ur with the least possible delay, if necessarv a nedical officer accompanying the case back in the machine. Cases not ot a minor nature were evacuated to Hinaidi or Basrah bv train or, in emergency, by air. (ii) Sanitation. tk;? 1116 difficu ^ t y was experienced at first as regards sanitary personnel. c Ve ^ t ?- so . lv ? ci b y tlie posting of trained assistants from the nativeTabou 'H' an( ^ supplementing wherever possible with local The unit sanitary equipment was extremely meagre and while the ncms camp s were forming there was much scope for improvisation. As nigs became more settled stores were sent down from Hinaidi, although larto? 16 CaSf S W j?3 ot Possible to supply the full wants of all the Columns, largely owing to difficulties of transport. At first the more simple types of field sanitation were employed, such VI .? e P P latrines, open incinerators and improvised ablution benches, iinri/-v f warni ® r wea tber came on the Senior Medical Officer stressed the . .P rtance of burning excreta and arrangements to do this were made wherever possible. • ^' ;Cr ' ' n ' lc Wition to the provision of box-type latrines various other },afh^ 6mC S j WC L r i e ^ r ) such as the erection of a semi-permanent Th ou . S( ' an a 'lution place and a permanent closed-beehive incinerator, e sanitation at the Columns was also considerably improved. hp^,c I iTK ber i? f 4 W ^ ter s a inples were taken from sources of water likely to 0 'y 1^-A.r. personnel. Some of these were found to contain an ■ ss or saline constituents, chiefly sulphates, and were in consequence w^^ rOUS i 0 Use- A11 supplies required treatment. The principle of 1 was f 0 byperchlorinate and eventually to remove the ' l chlorine with thiosulphate. A sufficient supply of the necessary f iicals was kept at Ur and the solutions made up and despatched in special containers to the columns. foUow; h - &lt; L SiCk rate for the P eriocI between 14/1/28 and 27/5/28 was as Average strength—300. 1 otal disabilities, excluding 48 hour cases—38. Total number of 48 hour cases—31. Total disabilities—69. r0 ^bree deaths, one in action and two (immediate) due to &gt;ing accident. There was one case of paratyphoid fever and one of severe ■ t ^ 0 tmrns ; the remaining disabilities were such as minor injuries and mild enteritis. ahf' the difficulties, the standard of sanitation was commcnd- 1 y tugh and reflects great credit on the individual medical officers and nnen concerned, who often had to carrv out their sanitary duties under very adverse conditions.42 APPENDIX No. 13. WEATHER. 1. The weather in and about the area of operations can be described as mainly 44 negative ^ throughout the year from about 0800 G.M.F. to 1400 G.M.T. or even later, especially in the areas of loose sand and fine dust north of Ur where the Euphrates used to flow. 2. Conditions were hard on aircraft working in the open for the following reasons :— (1) In January : frost and heavy rain with strong winds. (2) In February: strong winds reaching gale force at times. Thunderstorms. (3) In March : abnormally low temperatures were experienced in the early part of the month, also hard frosts, strong winds and snow-storms. March 15th it became suddenly hot with S. &amp; S.E. winds. March 17th, the wind changed to N'. and the temperature was again low. (4) In April: there were 25 days on which conditions were unfavour able for flying. Very high temperatures for so early in the year—101 degrees Fahrenheit being recorded inside the tents on 6th. 3. A steep pressure gradient existed between northern 'Iraq and the Persian Gulf causing northerly or north-westerly winds to blow with unusual regularity. The velocity of these winds is increased during the mid-day and the afternoon hours because of the surface heating, the lower layers of air which are in contact with the heated ground, rise, and in this way a mixing of the lower and upper air takes place ; resulting in the more rapid motion of the upper layers being imparted to the lower layers, then the winds freshen. 4. This, when combined with the areas of fine dust or sand in the opera tional district, results in poor visibility regularly. Fine dust normally remains in suspense till sunset. This is especially noticeable at Nuqrat Sulman, where, if there is little wind as is usual in the early mornings, the dust blown up by machines ' taking off ' hangs about for a considerable time. 5. This year is marked by the passage of small depressions during the night, resulting in an extremely high percentage of north or north -westerly winds and a well marked diurnal variation of direction and force of wind. From dead calm or light airs at sunrise the wind increases to a moderate breeze by about 10 a.m., and by 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. it has become a fresh or even strong breeze usually necessitating the despatch of warning signals. 6. A marked inverted ' V' shaped depression passed over Ur on 12th April, causing a dust storm in the afternoon. At 1330 G.M.'l. the wind suddenly changed from S.W. to N., the velocity remaining strong. During April month several small but definite depressions-passed over; these were secondaries to large primaries which were reported over Auatolie. They were remarkable for rapidity of travel.43 W/T Control—H.Q. AKFORCE UR. ISTUCOI. BUSCOl. KOWCOL SHABCOL GORCOL DETAILS S.S.O. . . V J. O. \J. . . DETAILS SULMAN. BUSAIYAH KOWAIT. SHABICHA.

The whole group worked on a wavelength of 1,550 metres for internal communication. 4. In the first month of the operations a continuous watch was kept by all column stations. At the end of that period it was found possible to close down during the night, after all traffic had been cleared, except on occasions when intelligence indicated the possibility of raids. During quiet periods it was generally possible to close column stations about 2200 hours L.T., a listening watch then being kept on the Group wave by the H.Q. station to receive possible alarm calls from columns. 5. Two additional W/T stations were erected at H.Q., Ur, to relieve the group wave of traffic between A.H.Q. and H.Q., Akforce. These stations worked on 1,300 and 42 metres, the latter being an alternative for use at times when atmospherics prohibited long wave working. Direct traffic between A.H.Q., Basrah and Shaibah was routed via the S/W station at Basrah, also working on 42 metres, thus relieving the congestion on the 1,550 metres wave. Ground Stations. 6. With the exception of Shaibah and the S/W stations at Ur and Basrah, all stations were equipped with transmitters, type T.21, and receivers, type T.f. 7. Power for all stations, with the exception of Shaibah, was supplied bv accumulators and 80-watt generators. 8. Each station was provided with two 30-ft. light type steel masts. The unsuitability of these masts for operations of the present nature is dealt with in para. 47. 9. The control station at H.Q., Akforce, was originally equipped with 30-ft. masts, but when it became evident that the operations were likelv to continue into the summer months, 70-ft. masts were erected at both I,300 and 1,500 metres stations, a single wire from the halyard of the feeder end of the 1,300 system being utilised for S/W transmission. A singli wire about 20 ft. in length slung inside the W/T tent was used for reception.44 Aircraft. 10. All aircraft were fitted with type T.21 transmitters and type T.f. receivers. Forced landing equipment was carried by all W/T aircraft. Armoured Cars. 11. Each armoured car section included a R.R. W/f tender, carrying a station of the T.21 and T.f. type. Mast gear consisted in some case^ of two Bentwood masts, and in others of six sections of a light type steel mast and one Bentwood mast. W/T during Action. 12. During the afternoon of January 29th, a reconnaissance from Buscol discovered and reported a raiding party 15 miles north of A1 Hafar. I he raiders were attacked, but it was not possible to reinforce the formation before hours of darkness. During the night orders were issued for a concentration of Nucol and Buscol aircraft at Rukhaimiyah, the forward base being protected by a car section from Buscol, who also provided W/T communication. The following day the raiders were not located owing to adverse weather conditions until 1430 hours L.T., when they were engaged by a formation from Nucol S.W. of Hafar. A formation from Buscol, in the air at the time, about 50 miles further west, was informed by W/T by the leader of the. Nucol formation and proceeded to reinforce him, arriving after the departure of the latter and completing the disintegration of the raiding force. This was the first instance of a formation in the air being informed bv W/T of the location of raiders by another formation engaged in the attack. 13. The forward base at Rukhaimiyah was kept open until the area south of Hafar had been cleared of raiders, no W/T failures being experienced. Short delays occurred at night owing to the necessity for the use of buscol as a link with H.Q., Akforce, during periods when atmospherics were abnormal. Up to this period of the operations weather conditions had been unsettled and abnormal atmospherics had occurred with the approach of rain storms. These periods had been of comparatively short duration, none being sufficiently severe to close down a station for more than two or three hours at a time. 14. With the approach of wanner weather, however, the Strength of atmospherics increased appreciably, particularly between sunset and dawn. Atmospherics appeared to be strongest upon the occasions of rapid changes of temperature, high winds and dust storms. 15. Throughout the months of March and April, dust storms occurred practically every day at Ur, the dust commencing to rise between 0900 and 1100 hours L.T., and subsiding with the approach of darkness at 1800 hours. Atmospherics were strongest for the first three or four hours of the dust storm and were severe enough to prevent all working with columns stations during that period. On days when the wind speed and the volumes of dust remained constant, after the preliminary rising, it was generally possible to re-open and watch early in the afternoon, conditions then gradually improving throughout the night. On days when it became impossible to work from the commencement of the storm and throughout the dav, it was generally possible to clear all traffic between the hours of 0300 and 0600 hours L.T. The strength of atmospherics in bad dust storms may be estimated from the fact that, when the aerial lead was held near the earth terminal, sparks one quarter of an inch in length occurred continuously, the spark itself resembling that from the continuous discharge of a condenser.45 16. On 19th February, a reconnaissance from Shaibah located and reported a raiding force 10 miles north-east of AI Raqai. The report was received by W/f at 0835 hours G.M.T. and orders for a concentrated attack upon the raiders by the aircraft of Buscol and Shaibah were issued at 0852 hours. At 1020 another party was reported 10 miles south of J arishan, orders to Buscol and Shaibah being issued by W/T at 1049. These orders were intercepted by the first Buscol formation in the air, but no action could be taken since one machine was compelled to return to Rukhaimiyah with engine trouble. A formation from Buscol proceeded to J arishan, but was compelled to land with engine trouble 15 miles south-west of its objective. The forced landing set was erected and a reply to the first call was made by the H.Q. station, information being transmitted to the formation leader on the ground. 17. Car sections had been ordered out from Shaibah and Rukhaimiyah, but were on the move during the day and so were unable to erect their W/r set until dark, when they reported their location. Further action against the raiders was taken by aircraft and cars on 20th and 21st February, W/T being used continually for the passing of orders and information. No cases of failure were reported although difficulty was experienced in working the Armoured Car Section owing to the weakness of their signals. 18. Upon receipt of information that the raiders would probably reassemble at Es Safa (80 miles S.E. of Al Hafar) an attack on the concentration by three Victorias and 12 D.H.9As was organised for 24th February. The attack was carried out on that date, W/T being carried by all three Victorias and by two D.H.9As. The formation left Rukhaimiyah at dawn and at once established W/T touch with Akforce, the progress of the raid and other information being transmitted on both the outward and homeward journey. 19. Meteorological reports, received by H.Q., were retransmitted to the aircraft and reports of the weather conditions en route received. 20. Signal strength at Ur from the formation leader's Victoria over ts Safa (a distance of approximately 230 miles) was R.7. During the raid the leaders of the D.H.9A formations kept in touch with the leading lc «?' a . a ^stance of from one mile, when approaching the objective, to 30 miles when making attacks on detachments of the scattered raiding force. No W/T failure occurred. 21. On 27th February, a new column, consisting of one flight of D.H.9As and two sections of armoured cars, was formed at Kuwait and designated Kowcol. 22. H.M.S. 'Emerald' formed an extremely useful link in the W/T organisation of Akforce during her stay at Kuwait. On occasion, when abnormal atmospherics prohibited communication between H.Q. and columns, the ship, which was nearly always able to read Ur, was asked to broadcast orders and information to the columns on full power. This piocedure was successful on several occasions and enabled orders to be transmitted to columns when communication between them and H.Q. was impossible on the low power available. -3. At the commencement of operations, ordinary position and winding m signals were sent. -4. Owing to the vast quantity of traffic and the necessity of the priority 01 signals from reconnaissances, the system was very quickly modified as follows. -^5. Departure signals were sent from ground stations. A moderate J'lay was immaterial. Arrival signals were sent from ground stations46 26. Aircraft sent no signals except:— (i) In case of forced landing. (ii) Winding in at forced landed machines. (iii) Winding in at armoured car or other places not a W/T base. 27. Supcol aircraft kept aerials out all the time. They could therefore receive instructions, weather warnings, etc., whilst in the air. 28. Another valuable use of W/T reception will be found under ' Direction Finding ' (paras. 57 to 63). 29. It is worthy of note that during active operations weather warnings frequently failed to get through owing to the jam of traffic. 30. It also frequently happened that warnings of thunder storms^ dust storms or dust rising failed to get through owing to atmospherics. This was a distinct source of danger and pilots asking for reports in doubtful weather had to bear this in mind. Armoured Train. 31. On March 1st, an armoured train, which had been sent to Ur for the protection of the railway between Ur and Basrah was fitted with W/T. The station was of the T.21 and T.f. type, an aerial of 60 ft. in length, with an effective height of 15 ft. being fitted. Tests were carried out with the train on the move and stationary. Whilst stationary, Shaibah was worked from Ur, the signal strength from each station being satisfactory, except for working under bad conditions. 32. Whilst on the move, transmissions from the train to Ur and Shiabah were good and signals were easily readable by each place. Reception in the train itself, however, was difficult at speeds above six miles per hour, signals being broken each time the wheels of the coach containing the set passed over joints in the rails. This was not a serious disadvantage since at the action speed of the train (eight miles per hour) call signs could be recognised, and it was arranged that the train should be slowed down to four miles per hour on receipt of a call. 33. The W/T worked satisfactorily each time a run was made by the train. In addition to W/T, a telephone system was installed, working between the various coaches and the engine. 34. On March 2nd, a formation from N'ucol forced landed owing to snow storms near Jokha (160 miles S.W. of Ur). 1 his location was reported without difficulty by means of the forced landing set. 35. On March 7th, a formation from Nucol failed to return to the Column by nightfall. The W/T aircraft was called at intervals by the H.Q. station, but, although it was heard working, its signals were too weak to be readable and by midnight they had completely faded out. The machine was located the following morning abandoned at a point about 40 miles south-west of A1 Athamin. A landing was made by the aircraft and the forced landing equipment was erected, but communication could not be established since the accumulators had completely run down. A spare set, which had been brought out, was connected up and communication was established with Ur (200 miles). The primary cause of the failure was insufficient length of aerial owing to loss of the trailing aerial and consequent inability to radiate sufficient power to cover the range required. The engine fault was located and the aircraft was flown in to Nucol later in the day.47 36. On March 30th, intelligence reports indicated the proximity of a large i aiding force at A1 liashuk, in consequence of which orders were issued for the formation of a temporary base at A1 Hafar, consisting of two armoured car sections and six D.H.9As. The base was opened on April 2nd, aircraft reconnaissances being carried out over the whole of the area Linah—A1 Bashuk—A1 Hafar. For the three days during which the reconnaissances were carried out, no difficulty was experienced in this area by aircraft in working either their bases or H.Q. at Ur. 37. From April 5th onwards the amount of operational flying and conse quent W/T traffic gradually decreased owing to the disbandment of the raid reported on March 30th, and the arrangements for a meeting between Ibn Sa'ud and a representative of the Government. 38. During the period of the operations the standard of W/T efficiency was extremely high. All equipment had been subjected to severe tests but cases of complete breakdown were rare. Difficulty in establishing communication with out-stations and especially with armoured cars operating away from their bases, have been almost entirely due to the abnormal atmospherics which are a feature of 'Iraq at this time of the year. 39. In spite of the fact that all aircraft have been in the open since the commencement of operations, only three failures occurred. 40. W/T flying times for the period January 8th to March 31st were as follows :— No. 30 (B) Squadron No. 55 (B) Squadron No. 70 (B) Squadron No. 84 (B) Squadron Total 190 hrs. 5 minutes. 506 hrs. 15 minutes. 1,400 hrs. 0 minutes. 663 hrs. 40 minutes. 2,760 hrs. 0 minutes. v fl « 41. No abnormal ground to air or air to ground ranges were obtained but aircraft flying over the western portion of the border and as far south as t.mah and A1 Bashuk could be worked comfortably by H Q \kforce except where conditions were bad for W/T. Apart from the three failures already reported, no cases occurred of failure of aircraft to work their columns whilst on reconnaissance or when attacking raiding forces. hv 4 u The foUowmg are the total numbers per month of messages handled oy H.Q., Akforce W/T Station ;— O.

Armoured Car W T. 43. Although only one case occurred of complete failure of car sections to establish communication with headquarters, difficulties were often experienced in working cars when operating away from their bases. Assuming that the radius of action of a section can be as much as 200 miles, it is essential that the W/T installation should have a guaranteed range of at least that amount. With the present installation, this is impossible, and is due to the fact that, owing to the necessity for the use of the \V/T tender as a baggage car, the mast apparatus carried is insufficient for the erection of an efficient aerial system. 44. In addition, all spares, such as accumulators, etc., have to be reduced to a minimum and reliance must be placed upon the car lighting system for charging. 45. The reduction of baggage to the absolute minimum and its careful stowage to prevent interference with the functioning of the W/T tender is the only possible remedy in the present circumstances. 46. For rapidity in getting into communication after a halt, it is suggested that a light type of metal telescopic mast be evolved, to be fixfed perma nently on the side of the tender, and wound up and down by means of a rachet or pulley device. The instruments should be properly mounted in a position behind the passenger's seat, where they can be ready for immediate use. The free end of the aerial could be carried by a 30 ft. light steel mast. Mast Equipment. 47. The expenditure of guys and sections for the 30-ft. light type steel mast has been abnormally high. In most cases masts have been erected in soft sand and have had to withstand heavy rain storms and winds of gale force. It is realised that the masts were designed for use at battery stations but they are the only type at present in use which can be carried by car sections and erected by a small staff in a short space of time. Since out-stations in 'Iraq, and particularly armoured cars, may be called upon to work over long distances, it is considered that a stronger type of mast should be evolved, giving an effective height to the aerial of at least 36 ft., with a light type of derrick to facilitate erection. In the present type of 30-ft. light mast, guys and thimbles should be strengthened. Ground Station Equipment. 48. The transmitter T.21 and receiver T.f. worked satisfactorily over the ranges in existence when the aerial and earth systems were good and when atmospherics were not above normal. At times, however, when atmospherics were strong, but not strong enough to completely close stations down, an increase of 20 or 30 watts in the power of the transmitter would have saved numbers of delays. In such cases Columns were ordered to increase the input voltage of the 80-watt generator to 12, thus increasing anode voltage to 1,200 or 1,300. This increase often enabled columns to bo read and save delays. 49. It is suggested that tests be made with a transmitter type T.21 a, modified for H.T. voltage of 1,500, with a view to the equipment of portable ground stations with a set which may have a reserve of power capable of overcoming the disadvantages of an inefficient aerial system, and of being read in cases such as that described above.49 Portable Petrol Electric Charging Sets. 50. Norman Lyon charging sets were in constant use by all columns during the operations. On the whole they worked efficiently in spite of their unsuitability for work under the conditions existing in the southern desert. 51. It is suggested that charging sets for this type of work should have the output of the single purpose Norman Lyon, but should be fitted with a twin cylinder engine of the same type as that fitted to the Stuart Turner but of more robust construction. In operations of this kind, charging sets run for at least 12 hours per day in a sandy desert, and often in the middle of sand storms, from which it is impossible to shelter them efficiently. 52. It is interesting to note that on one occasion an unbroken initial charge for 54 hours of twelve 2 v. 90 a.h. accumulators was carried out with a single purpose Norman Lyon set. Armoured Train -Telephone System. 53 I he telephone system on the armoured train consisted of five D.3 telephones connected to a central instrument on the footplate of the engine. Although an attempt to improve the strength of speech was tnade b\ connecting accumulators at the centre and extremities of the circuit, no communication was possible at speeds above four miles per hour. This was unsatisfactory, since the action speed was determined at eight miles per hour, communication at that speed being carried out by means of a simple code of whistle blasts from the engine. 54. It is considered that the train should be fitted with a power buzzer system over which orders could be passed, either by the use of a simple code, or by Morse code in cases not covered by the former. Use of S W. 55. The S/W set installed at Ur for working with Baghdad proved to be extremely useful at times when atmospherics prohibited long wave working, and a route to Baghdad could be relied upon under all but the very worst conditions, in spite of the inexperience of the personnel in the handling of S/W apparatus. 56. This would suggest that S/W is particularly adaptable to armoured cars in view of the long ranges over which they have to work and the low power available. In addition, since with the use of S/W a small permanent aerial could be utilised, communication between armoured car sections could be established whilst on the move. It is realised that armoured cars are required to co-operate with aircraft and that the latter would therefore be compelled to use the same wavelength. It is felt, however, as a result of experience gained during the operations, that the time and money spent on the perfection of a certain means of communica- a 1 ?* under aU conditions and between all units of a force such as Akforce would be justified, and that the general use of S/W would provide that means. Direction Finding. 5/. In order to save time and ensure success on proceeding for the first time to a new landing ground, some sort of assistance was necessary in order to find it without delay. Either a guide from an aeroplane whose pilot had landed there before, or W/T, as follows. 58. A valuable use of W/T reception was in guiding aircraft to their destinations. On several occasions Supcol aircraft asked cars, or other50 ground stations, to send the position of the aircraft, if they could see or hear it. By this means, the aircraft could be guided to its destination. 59. It frequently happened that ground personnel could see or hear aircraft in the air many miles away, when the aircraft itself could not discern the ground station, and there were no topographical features, or other means of locating the landing ground, or when visibility was very low. 60. This procedure proved very valuable and might be adapted as standard procedure between aircraft and armoured cars or other ground W/T stations, working under similar conditions. 61. It is considered that there is a definite use for D/F in operations of this kind. If two portable sets had been installed at Shaibah and Sulman they could have been used for the following purposes :— (a) The fixing of formations whilst on reconnaissance. (b) The location of forced landed aircraft. (c) The fixing of places on the map which could not be visited by a ground survey officer. 62. The greater part of the southern desert is practically featureless. This and the fact that winds are local and often change direction several times during a flight of two or three hours' duration makes the keeping of a correct course a difficult matter. If D/F had been used pilots need have felt no anxiety and could have checked their courses frequently. In addition to this, the majority of places are wrongly fixed on the map, some having been found by ground survey actually to be several miles from their supposed position. If D/F had been used places such as Linah, Ansab, A1 Hashuk, A1 Hafar, and turning points of reconnaissances could have been fixed early in the operations ; in fact a miniature survey of all reconnaissance routes could have been carried out in a very short space of time. The places mentioned above as examples are all in enemy territory and, with the exception of A1 Hafar, could not be fixed by the ground survey officer. 63. The importance of the immediate location of a forced landed formation need not be stressed. Leaders of such formations were only able to give estimated positions and at least one case occurred where a location could not be given since W/T signals from the aircraft on the ground were unreadable. In a case such as this a location could be found by D/F so long as some sort of signals were heard from the aircraft, whilst in the air. Codes and Ciphers. 64. Very little cipher work was necessary between the Columns during the operations and plain language was used to avoid delays, although every Column had a cipher for inter-communication. No difficulty was experienced and the total number of cipher and code messages passed through A.H.Q. during the period January to March was 616 (In, 287 ; Out, 329). Supply o! Stores. 65. 11 has already been reported that, at the commencement of operations, all types of stations carried a minimum of spares. It therefore became necessary on several occasions to submit large, urgent demands for all kinds of spares, principally charging sets, mast gear, transmitters and transmitting valves. In nearly all cases these were promptly met.51 Similar O ? 0ra j ions ma y have to be undertaken ir^ntLr Iv! . } }' 111 a &gt;' coincide with operations on the northern frontier, the present scale of reserve stores is being reviewed. Behaviour of Personnel. .i, 66 ' k 11 P erson ? el have maintained a high standard of efficiencv h operations. They have been called upon to work under Itaff h h exactm S conditions and, although stations were often under staffed and cases occurred where watches of over 12 hours daily were kent by one operator, they have performed their duties without' complaint The flying personnel are particularly deserving of praise since thev accompamed five or six hours reconnaissances daily for long periods and in 'Iraqi W/T Personnel. 67. Prior to the commencement of operations a W/T station, manned bv Iraqi operators, existed in the police post at Busaivah Ilnnn t)i . i^iT 1 and Shabco1 ' detachments of the 'Iraq Army were H.t l ? ^ U1 i ^ ^™ a i} ent Posts and to assist in defence ' These detachments included W/T sections manned by 'Iraqi operators In ill cases supervision was exercised by British operators who also took all com^nicaSdE? 1131 Peri0dS ^ When atmos P he 'CS rendered 'Iraqi operators, on the whole, were fairly efficient. Delays occurred however as the result of the difference in the procedure used by thc R A F.' ', e Iraq Anny.
