Since ) ) Captain Fazluddin, T .k.S., feft 'HodeidaH in September 1924, my First Assistant Resident has held charge of the office of political Officer at Hodeidah, in addition to his other duties. The First Assistant Resident is unable to visit the town in view of his important duties at Aden, and much avoidable correspondence takes place between him and the Political Clerk at Hodeidah, Mr. Hassan Kanjooni , especially in the matter of his accounts. Kamaran is close to Hodeidah and I am of the opinion that a more satisfactory arrangement could be made by appointing the Civil Administrator, Kamaran, as Political Officer, Southern Red Sea Coast, with the Hodeidah Mission under his control. He could visit Hodeidah and other coast towns from time to time, and keep in touch with developments on the mainland, as he has recently done on H.M .3 .'CALLIOPE' and H.M.S .'EMERALD' . Captain Wickham, the Civil Administrator, has expressed his willingness to do this duty without any permanent pay or allowance. It will ho?/ever, be necessary to pay him his travelling expenses as was done when he was sent on H.M.S. 'CALLIOPE'. If you approve of this proposal, I will submit it for the sanction of the Government of India, as the /the Kainaran Administration is under their control. I have, etc. (Signed) J. H. K.

From, Major-General J.H.K*Stewart, C.B., D.S.O., Political Resident, Aden. To, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London. Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to my telegram No.54 of 22nd May 1926, reporting that the Italians intended appointing a Consular Officer at Hodeidah. 2* The question arises whether it would not be advisable, provided the Imam agrees, to have a British Consular Officer at the same town. Our present agent there, though sometimes referred to in your despatches as Political Officer (e.g.your No.29 of 1st May 1926) is merely an Arabic Clerk, (originally 2nd Clerk in the British Consulate at Hodeidah,) with no knowledge of English, and not altogether satisfactory. The only reason why I have not tried to get a substitute for him is that the question of his retention is about to be considered shortly (your telegram of 1st April 1926) and in the meantime he enables us to keep a watch on events and a lien on Hodeidah with reference to any other representative we may wish to send there. 3. There was a British Vice-Consul at Hodeidah for many years before the War, so the appointment of one now would be no new departure. From a commercial point ofof view the port is of importance; before the War its annual trade exceeded £1,000,000, a very large proportion of which was British and British Indian (vide Consular Report No.4608 of 1910 on Hodeidah sent unfler your despatch No.21 of 17th March 1926). There is no need to emphasise the political importance of Hodeidah as the door of the Yemen opening on the outside world. 4. If a Consular Officer were appointed at Hodeidah, presumably he would be under the general control of this Residency which is the British Agency most nearly in touch with the Yemen.

Senior Naval Officer Red Sea having informed me that H.M.S. Calliope would visit some of the Southern Red Sea Ports on the Arabian coast at the beginning of January I consider it advisable in view of present political situation that a civil officer should accompany her. As I could not spare any political officer from Aden I have sent Captain Wickham Civil Administrator of Kamaran in H.M.S. Clematis which was going to Malta and instructed him to meet H.M.S. Calliope at Suez. Captain Wickham knows Arabic and is familiar with the political situation on the coast. I request that my action may be approved. I regret thatthere was no time to obtain your previous approval. The expenses involved in the mission will be Captain Wickham’s travelling allowance(s) admissible under our rules and some incidental expenses at places Commander of H.M.S. Calliope and he go ashore. I recommend that they may be paid by the Colonial Office. The amount is not likely to be heavy. Places to be visited are ?d Messawa Loheiya Hodeioah and Mocha. I intend to inform Imam of visits to his Ports and explain that they are of a complimentary nature.I O.M.E. 109/26 • TELEGRAM. From the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Resident, Aden.

In the correspondence Stewart suggests that such an appointment would be preferable to the present arrangement, which requires the person currently in charge of the office of Political Officer at Hodeidah, namely Stewart's First Assistant Resident in Aden, to engage in 'avoidable correspondence' with the Political Clerk at Hodeidah, since he is not able to leave his duties in Aden.The principal correspondents are the Political Resident at Aden, the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Leopold Stennett Amery), and various officials of the Colonial Office and Foreign Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
