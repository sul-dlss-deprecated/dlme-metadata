Also discussed are Jacob's fears of a forthcoming rebellion in Punjab and possible action by Russia.Pelly has written his observations and responses to Jacob's points over the top of the relevant sections. Pelly's responses include that when a soldier undertakes service he is not thinking of rewards but that he understands Jacob's concerns that the recommendations he made are not being taken up. Pelly also discusses attitudes in England and his belief that only a great crisis there would bring about change.Enclosed with this letter is correspondence from Henry Green and a letter to (Charles Frances Falcon) Chamberlain:Letter from Henry Green, Camp Peshta Khana to John Jacob, 4 May 1858, regarding the need and importance of recognising and valuing good work and his thoughts on the local tribes in the area (Baluchistan) and the trade routes and products of the local merchants.Letter from Henry Green, Camp Bopah, to Lewis Pelly, 6 May 1858, regarding Green's location in the Belooch hills and the situation in Beloochistan [Baluchistan] and India more widely.
