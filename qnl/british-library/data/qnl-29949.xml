I have to inform you of what happened on the night of 24th instant. Beni Hasan attacked the house of Sheikh Rawaf and killed him mercilessly. He was an innocent man and had neither committed any crime nor done any harm to any one. He was our neighbour living in the centre of the country. It is necessary that we should get his rights and take revenge. I find no other way. When we prepared to take the necessary action, Suleiman al Rawaf objected and asked us bo postpone it, as he feared that some trouble and disturb ance might arise which would involve people who committed the offence and as well as those who did not. He stated that he v is not living did not wish to be a cause of anything except good. He further sa^.d that as those people who killed his father are subjects of the Sultan of Muscat and he himself is a Saudi Arabian subject he wanted your help. His letter is sent herewith. When I came to knew that he intends to refer the matter to the Saudi Government, I did not think it a proper thing to do. On the contrary it is our duty and yours too to help and to do whatever is needed to recover his rights. This matter concerns all and I and you are one and the same.

I beg to state that my father Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmad al Rawaf Najdi, a Qadi resident of Bu Ali, has been killed by the Beni Hasan intentionally without any reason. He was attacked in the later part of the night of 24th Bfuharram in his house and was killed by shooting. He was neither fighting nor was there any cause for a fight, but he was killed in a battle field. He was not carrying any weapons. They knew of his position and place of residence. He was a foreigner to them. As the deceased is my father and I am a subject of Saudi Arabian Government, who are responsible to look after us, and your station is nearest to the place of murder, I request to you to apply the provisions of the laws existing between our two Governments in a case of this kind. I request that you will kindly give me the possible reasons that lead to the murder of my father as religious and other laws demand it. I further request that you will kindly let me know if the laws existing between our Governments are the same that exist between our Government and other Governments of the world. If there are not( laws to observe between your Government and the Government of whom I am a subject, I request for a reply so that I may refer the matter to my Government, who are responsible to protects the rights of their subjects.

Communications, &gt;ur . iiSRORT OH A VISIT TO SUR IN AUGUST 1^40. ' &gt; -&gt; Sur is the second largest sea i&gt;ort in the territory of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. A very considerable trade in ’‘wet' and ‘dry'dates is carried on with India and quantities of rice, sugar and piece goods are imported from India by native craft. Practically the whole of tne trade of the port is in the hands of the British Indian Community. The British Indian community consist of 62 Hindu merchants. Naturally various ^rooiems must arise from time to time and periodical visits by the roiiticai Agent at Muscat are necessary to examine these problems and to maxe such representations as may be desirable to tne local officials and if necessary to the Suitan himself. Tne normal means of communication with Cur which is situated on the ccast about one hundred miles from Muscat and twelve miles from Ras Al Hadd is by country craft. This form of travel is extremely uncertain depending as it does on the strength and direction of the wind and a voyage may be as short as twelve hours or as long as twelve days. Sur can also be reached by land via Qariyat, Dhib&amp;b and Tiwi. The land journey takes four days and is very difficult and trying undertaking even in the cold weather as it is possible to motor only as far as Q,ariyat ana from there onwards donxeys are tne onlj means of transport which can negotiate the extremely difficult and rough trad. A well engined launch could do the journey in ten hours in all we a the rr except tne very worst storms. Unfortunately such - craft are not available locally. The Political Agent not being supplied with one and there being none owned by the local business houses. On*the present occasion I determined to examine the land route partly because it would, in an emergency be the on^y one practicable if there were contrary winds or storms at the time an emergency occurred and partly because a visit was long overdue and the only power craft at Muscat, a decrepit thirty foot launch capable of a maximum speed of five knots in a fiat calm, was reported to be out of commission being laid up with engine trouble. However this launch was ready the evening before 1 was due to start and so I decided to hire it and arranged for it to accompany me by sea while I travelled by land. i travelled by land as far as Dhibab and then took to the launch as land travel in the heat was difficult and from Dhibab onwards the track is decernable from the sea and a full idea oi the difficulties to be overcome and the distances to be covered can be obtained. My return journey was made by launch to (^ariyat and from there to Muscat by land. The launch broxe down twice on the way to Sur and twice on the return journey. I am glad to say that the sea was calm when we were stationary carrying out repairs and except for the excessive heat and delay were not inconvenienced. tfhile at Sur the launch on two occasions broke down completely after I had embarxed to go to Knor Jarama but I am pleased to record we were oniy a short distance from Sur on each occasion. The launch was so unsatisfactory that I hired a local craft for the return journey and actually left Sur in her but as the wind changed to dead ahead and the launch appeared to be working unusually well I transferred to the launch and with the exception of a breakdown for two hours in the middle of tne night off a rocky shore the journey was completed without incident. The country craft followed ready to render assistance should it be necessary and a system of prearranged signals was worxed out. As I have already noted tne Hindu population is 62. I found them Very contented with their situation. Their relations with the local Governor are very good and I gathered that ff trade is also in a very satisfactory state. I had several interviews with tnem collectively and also saw individuals privately. There were several points which they asxed me/ to taice for taeia and I am grad to aay I found no difficulty in having them dealt with to the satisfaction of the local authority and the merchants themselves, A problem of more importance in regard to tne safe guarding of their business premises I reserved for discussion with the Sultan at iluscat. The tribal situation in the t$&lt;hi is satisfactory and will not be lively to deteriorate as long as the present Governor remains m office. I am not so happly aoout the tribal situation in da*lan as the feud between the Beni Hasan and the Beni Bu Aii soil! continues and I see no immediate livelihood of a settlement being reached. I am distinctly uncomiortaoie aoout our iac* of coBimunication with the British Indian Comniumty and cannot too strongly urge that steps be taven without delay to provide a reliable' poweriuliy engined launch so that assistance can oe given in the shortest possible time snould the need arise. iAPPENDIX.
