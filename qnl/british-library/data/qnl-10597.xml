The area of the town and coastline visible in the distant middleground is the part of the town featured in the previous image (Photo 430/8/1). A ship can be seen emerging from behind the promontory right of centre on the horizon near Fort Al-Mirani.While those distant buildings are clearly several-storeyed white-washed buildings, the dwellings in the fore- and middleground are, for the most part, tents and other temporary structures. Overlooking these, on the western ridge a fortified tower can be seen in the far left of the image.A group of figures stands under a single tree in the foreground.InscriptionsUpper right, in pen, on image: ‘p. 3’; alongside image, in pencil: ‘b’Lower right, in pencil, alongside image: ‘2’Below image: 'The Town looking North. 31 Oct. 1900'</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Landscape photography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023515398.0x00000a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
