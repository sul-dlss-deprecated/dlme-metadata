Adapted for pack purposes, but loads would be too heavy for pack mule of pony-possibly could be loaded on camels. Dates of manufacture vary from 1925 to present year. Barrels rifled rat very inaccurately. Breech mechanism vary—some Lewis type, others Wellin type but very badly fitted, and would become unsafe to fire after very few fullcharge rounds. All guns have spring buffer and recuperator combined. Only wo guns have any kind of space. Only two guns have any sights at all, these are open sights aid consists of a foresight (acorn shaped) on a bracket fixed to the cradle, and a backsight. The backsight consists of bar, graduated in yards and operated by a worm hand wheel. The graduations are purely arbitrary and bear no relation to the actual shooting capa- lubties of the guns. The elevating gear consists of a central screw operated by a hand-wheel; similarly the traversing gear ,s the screw and si,eve type. A1 gears are very roughly made and badly lubricated and consequently very difficult to operate. The ammunition is all fixed and has a brass cartridge. Shells, about 10-lb. in weight, are solid, and have a ver^ roughly made driving band. Cartridges, made of brass are very roughly shaped, and do not fit properly into the cham^ ber and consequently spbt when the gun ,s fired. The Superintendent of the factory has no idea as to the actual ranges and accuracy of the guns. There ,s no connected equipment for the guns. On the whole, I consider it would be much safer to be fired at by the guns, than to fire them. As regards light automatic guns, there was one very old French ‘ Levels ’ Mitrallense or Miehni guns, also an Afghan- Duble barrelled Gatling gun. I did not see any other light automtic weapons. Both these are veri old and of little made double use. II. —Khan of Khar. The Kha,n owns four brass guns two of which are large, firing a solid ball 3^'calibre, 4 lbs. weight, range 1 500 yards.

Note regarding the small guns in the possession of the Nawab of Dir, Khan of Khar, the Wali of Swat, in the Khyber, and North and South Waziristan Agencies. I.—Nawab of Dir. The Nawab s guns were inspected during the Chitral Reliefs, 1930, by Lieutenant Howard, Commanding Chitral M. A. Section, who reports as follows :— 1. Two 2 calibre guns probably 7-pounder, without sights of any description. Fire solid shells with a brass cartridge. Would be of no use except for saluting pur poses, used mainly as such. 2. Seven breech-loading guns of 275' of 3' calibre. Adapted for pack purposes, but loads would be too heavy for pack mule or pony—possibly could be loaded on camels. Dates of manufacture vary from 1925 to present year. Barrels rifled but very inaccurately. Breech mechanism vary—some Lewis type, others Wellin type but very badly fitted, and would become unsafe to fire after very few full- charge rounds. All guns have spring buffer and recuperator combined. Only two guns have any kind of space. Only two guns have any sights at all, these are open sights and consists of a foresight (acorn shaped) on a bracket fixed to the cardie, and a backsight. The backsight consists of bar, graduated in yards and operated by a worm hand-wheel. The graduations are purely arbitrary and bear no relation to the actual shooting capabilities of the guns. The elevating gear consists of a central screw operated by a hand-wheel; similarly, the travers ing gear is the screw and slieve type. All gears are very roughly made and badlv lubricated and consequently very difficult to operate. The ammunition is all fixed and has a brass cartridge. Shells, about 10-lb. in weight, are solid, and have a very roughly-made driving band. Cartridges, made of brass are very roughly shaped, and do not fit properly into the chamber and consequently split when the gun is fired. The Superintendent of the factory has no idea as to the actual ranges and accuracy of the guns. There is no connected equipment for the guns. On the whole, I consider it would be much safer to be fired at by the guns, than to fire them. 3. As regards light automatic guns, there was one very old French ‘ Levels ’ Mitrailleuse or Michni guns, also an Afghan-made double barrelled ‘ Gatling ’ gun. I did not see any other light automatic weapons. Both these are very old and of lifctl« use.” II. — Khan of Khar, The Khan owns four brass guns, two of which are large, firing a solid ball 3^' calibre, 4 lbs. weight, range 1,500 yards. One is medium, firing a'ball 24' calibre, 2| lbs. weight, range 1,500 yards. Oue is small, firing a ball 2' calibre, 2 lb. weight, range 1,000 yards. These guns are used in inter-tribal fighting but do little damage and inspire no terror. III. —Wali of Swat. The Wali of Swat has eight guns, two of a very old pattern and four breech-loaders made in his own factory. They are used chiefly for firing salutes, but a field firing exhibition was given in February 1926 at Saidu for the benefit of the Political Agent. Solid projectiles were fired at a target on the opposite hill-side from two of the most modern guns. At a range of about 1,500 yards, fair accuracy was obtained. IV. — Khyber Agency. Nawab Mohd.

The variations in the figures for armaments are very slight. Malakand Agency .—The reasons for the increase and decrease in the fighting strengths and armaments of the Tribes in the Malakand Agency are as follows :— -I Chitral .—No variation. i The increase in armament under “ Nawab of Dir ” and decreases under Adinzai and Dush Khel are due to the fact that in the year 1940-41, the Nawab disarmed Adinzai and part of the Dush Khel and transferred serviceable arms to f own bodyguard. The remaining confiscated arms were unserviceable and were ! stored by the Nawab. Swat. The increase of 2,500 Muzzle loading rifles against Babuzai is due to the fact that the State disarmed the tribes of the Indus Kohistan during 1940-41 and increased the armament of the State standing Army accordingly. Bajaur—Khan of Khar. —There is a slight variation in he fighting strength which does not call for any comments. North Waziristan Agency. —The increases shown in the fighting strengths are based on enquiries made during the recent Census. The increases in arms largely follow increases in the fighting strength. South Waziristan Agency. —A small increase in the armament of the Bahlolzai tribe is due to the fact that this tribe takes a more prominent part in hostilities than the other two leading sections. Khyher Agency. —The increase in fighting strength is the result of a more accu rate estimate made in connection with the Census. The increase in the total of breech loading rifles is partly set off by a decrease in the number of muzzle loading rifles, which are presumably regarded as out of date and partly believed to be due to better economic conditions, which have encouraged the tribesmen to invest more money in armaments.

The slight increase shown in most areas is due to the higher price of manufacture on account of war conditions.

Peshawar District .— There is a slight increase in the number of fighting men. % c ‘ ul ~ V ^ Hazara District. —The slight increase in the number of breech-loading rifles ~ 7 held by the Hazara border tribes is due to the trade done by the Airidis Arms smugglers of the Kohat Pass. Figures relating to the Indus Kohistanis were verified last year. Further verification will be made when the Passes are open during the current summer. The existing figures have been allowed to stand. Dera Ismail Khan District. —The reasons for thfe variation are :— Fighting strength and armament in Transborder Bhittanis. In previous years no enquiry was made regarding the Bannu Bhittanis strength. This year however their figures have been ascertained and included in the statement. Increase of arms held by the Sheranis is due to enmity of the Hassan Khel Sheranis with the Zilli Khel Wazirs. To defend themselves the Hassan Khels have increased their arms. Malakand Agency. —The reasons for the increase and decrease in the fighting strength and armaments of tribes in the Malakand Agency are as follows : Chitral .— There is very little change in the figures supplied'by the Assistant Political Agent, Chitral concerning His Highness’s Body Guard, Muzzle Loading Rifles, i.e., 6,000 instead of 5,995. Dir .— The figures now supplied by the Nawab of Dir have been verified and may be taken as correct. Swat. —All figures previously given separately for Swat State and Buner have now been combined under the head “ Swat State ”. The figures now given are the official returns supplied by the Swat State, and may be relied upon. As the figures submitted in previous returns were not the official figures supplied by the State, there appears to be no necessity to enter into detailed explanations of individual variations. The fighting strengths are not tribal fighting strengths, but refer to the Swat State standing army. Protected Area — Samranzai .— Increase is due to the fact that there is no check on the purchase and sale of Arms in the protected area. Bajaur—Khan of Khar.—As far as the Khan of Khar is concerned, only a slight variation is reported in the fighting strengths and armaments and needs no explanation. North Waziristan Agency .— The, increase in the number of arms is due to the disturbed conditions prevailing in the Agency. South Waziristan Agency—The decrease of L. E. and L. M. rifles held by the Mahsuds is due to several hundred rifles having been taken from them during the last 18 months on account of fines or by way of security. The number of M. M. rifles has increased as they are cheap and readily available. The Shaman Khel have suffered less than others in fines, etc., and have utilized their income to increase their armament. Ahmadzai Wazirs. —Owing to the Ahmadzai Wazirs having remained peaceful and having earned substantial profits on the Wana Project, they have been able to increase their armaments. Khyher Agency .— The number of -303 bore rifles is increasing. This is due to the fact that the tribesmen do their best to purchase this type of rifle whenever their means permit them to do so.

'Note regarding the small guns in the possession of the Nawab of Dir, Khan of Khar, the Wali of Swat, in the Khyber, and North and South Waziristan Agencies. L- Nawab of Dir. The Nawub's guns were inspected during the Chitral Reliefs, 1930, by Lieutenant Howard, Commanding Chitral M. A. Section, who reports as follows:— “ 1. Two 2' calibre guns probably 7-pounder, without sights of any description. Fire solid shells with a brass cartridge. Would be of no use except for saluting purposes, used mainly as such. 2. Seven breech-loading guns of 275' of 3' calibre. Adapted for pack purposes, but loads would be too heavy for pack mule or pony—possibly could be loaded on camels. Dates of manufacture vary from 1925 to present year. Barrels rifled but very inaccurately. Breech mechanism vary—some Lewis type, others Wellin type but very badly fitted, and would become unsafe to fire after very few full-charge rounds. All guns have spring buffer and recuperator combined. Only two guns have any kind of space. Only two guns have any sights at all, these are open sights and consists of a foresight (acorn shaped) on a bracket fixed to the cradle, and a backsight. The backsight consists of bar, graduated in yards and operated by a worm hand-wheel. The graduations are purely arbitrary and bear no relation to the actual shooting capabilities of the guns. The elevating gear consists of a central screw operated by a hand-wheel; similarly, the traversing gear is the screw and slieve type. All gears are very roughly made and badly lubricated and consequently very difficult to operate. The ammunition is all fixed and has a brass cartridge. Shells, about 10 lb. in weight, are solid, and have a very roughly-made driving band. Cartridges, made of brass are very roughly shaped, and do not fit properly into the chamber and consequently split when the gun is fired. The Superintendent of the factory has no idea as to the actual ranges and accuracy of the guns. There is no connected equipment for the guns. On the whole, I consider it would be much safer to be fired at by the guns, than to fire them. 3. As regards light automatic guns, there was one very old JB re or Michni guns, also an Afghan-made double barrelled g,^. .. not see any other light automatic weapons. Both these are very old and of little Gatling ’ gun. I did use. II. —Khan of Khar. The Khan owns four brass guns, two of which are large, firing a solid ball 3£' calibre, 4 lbs. weight, range 1,500 yards. One is medium, firing a ball 2jf calibre. 2| lbs. weight, range 1,500 yards. One is small, firing a ball '2' calibre, 2 lb. weight, range 1,000 yards. These guns are used in inter-tribal fighting but do little damage and inspire no terror. III. —Wali of Swat. The Wali of Swat has eight guns, two of a very old pattern and four breech-loaders made in his own factory.

The slight increase in the armament of Mohmands (Peshawar District) is due to the fighting between the Khans of Khar and Nawagai. The increase in the fighting men of Eabazai (Mitai Musakhel) is due to the fact that Maira Mu&gt;a Khels joined the Musa Khel I ashkar against the K1 an of Khar. The other variations are insignificant and no particular explanation is necessary. The slight decrease in the fighting men of Adam Khel (Jowakais of Bori and Past- wannis) is due to natural causes. The increase of 149 and 171 in the fighting men and totals of B. L. Rifles or Carbines on the Hazara border, is due to the fact that there has been skirmishing between the tribesmen throughout the year, particularly in the direction of Nandihar and Thakot. The prosecution of these feuds made it tempting for Afridi arms-smugglers from the Kohat Pass, to bring rifles and ammunition for sale to the Hazara border. The reasons for the increase and decrease in the fighting strength and arma ments of the Malakand Agency are reported to be as follows :— Bajaur.—Khan of Khar. L. E. &amp; L. M. Rifles. —The number of rifles now in possession of the Khan of Khar is 147 against 190 last year. 48 of this make were lost in the engagement in which the Nawagai Lashkar captured Khatirjam piquet from Khar. M. M. Martini Action Rifles {'303 bore). —The 500 rifles the Khan had last year are reported to have been distributed by the Khan to his allies, Abdur Rahim Khan Khalozai and the Khan of Kotkai, as a reward for, and in payment for, their support in the Khar-Nawagai dispute. The Khan is reported to have no rifles of this make now. M. II. { ‘450 bore). —This year's figures compared with those of last year, show a decrease of 1,060 rifles, some of which are reported to have been sold and some given in exchange for better rifles, that is, 1,100 increased under “ not classified ”. Sniders. —An increase, of 50 is shown in this year’s statement. These are the rifles which were in possession of the Khan’s relations and nob taken into account last year. Kohat District. —The variations in the figures are not great and are due to the natural causes of increase and decrease in the population.

The Government of India would be glad to receive your comments on the belief expressed in paragraph 8 of the Note on page 1 of the Statement, that the increase in ,303 bore rifles in the possession of the tribes of the Khyber Agency is due to the export of large quantities of arms and ammunition of the latest type to Afghanistan, which releases older armament from that country.

Your memorandum Ho .6993-F/38, dated tine 26th November 1938 on the above subject. 2. The beliof expressed in the Note on page 1 of the above quoted statement presupposes that (a) there are a large number of old .303 rifiee in the possession of the Afghan Government, and (b) that these are available for sale or presentation to the tribes. 3. As regards (a) it is not know’ll on v/hat this supposition is based. So far fie is known the present Afghan Government have never owned a large number of old weapons. Their armament consists mainly of .303 rifles purchased from or presented by the British Government in the last nine years none of which, on Afghan standards, would yet be considered old. These replaced a mixed collection of weapons of different bores, but mainly Russian or German Li&amp;users, of which there can never have been a very large number in the hands of the present Government. The total number of .303 rifles acquired since 1930 is believed to be 66,430, the great majority of which are in use by the Army or police. Some of these, from among the 3,000 bought from Poland in 1931, are in poor condition and my have been placed in the g arsenals along with the old Ruscian and Mauser rifles. (b) It is for obvious reasons against the policy of the Afghan Government to increase the tribal armament. huch action would be both senseless aid suicidal. On the issue of new rifles old anas are therefore collected and stored in the arsenals, u&amp;inly in the Arq, where some of them have been seen by the Military Attache. It is of course possible that all old ana are not nandeu in but it is understood that considerable care is taken to ensure tii&amp;t they should be. Awhile therefore it is possible that a few of triese obsolete weapons reach the tribes it does not seem likely that they do so in any quantities.Notes. Register No. P. Z. 8066/38 V/' SECRET.

The theory is again advanced (see passage marked A in covering note) that the export of large quantities of arms and ammunition of the latest type to Afghanistan releases older armament and accounts for the increase of A .303 rifles in possession of tribes of the Khyber Agency.

The corresponding figure for 1936-37 was 224,687. It is not clear whether this increase is partly to be accounted for by inclusiorT for the first time in 1937/38 of figures for the Jjov/akis of Bori/SECRET. FIL E COPV / FIGHTING STRENGTH AND ARMA OTE. The slight increase in the armament of Mohmands (Peshawar District) is due to the fighting between the Khans of Khar and Nawagai. Jowakis of Bori and Pastwani have been added under Afridis, as they are under the control of Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar. The increase of 206 B. L. rifles in the possession of the tribes of the Hazara border is due to the frequency of the arms traffic by the Afridi Arms-smugglers. The reasons for the increase and decrease in the fighting strength and arma ments of the Malakand Agency are :— Bajour .—The number of rifles has increased in Bajour owing to faction fighting, and in particular, to the Khar-Nawagai dispute which has involved many of the tribes. Utmankhd .—The increase of arms with the Shamozai Utmankhels is due to apprehension of an attack from the Nawab of Dir. Buber .—Is now under the control of the Wali of Swat and a number of tribes men have disposed of their arms. These were mostly purchased by the Mallar, etc. The latter have also purchased some rifles from the left bank Indus tribes fearing an attack by the Wali of Swat. The two States of Dir and Swat have also increased their armament by arms confiscated or purchased locally from the tribes ; while the Wali of Swat has pur chased 300 Mauser rifles under permit granted by the Government. The increase in • 303 bore rifles in the possession of the tribes of the Khyber Agency is believed to be due to (i) the export of large quantities of arms and ammunition of the latest type to Afghanistan, which releases older armament from Afghanistan, and (n) the popularity among the tribesmen of -303 bore L.E., and L. M. rifles, owing to the greater difficulty of obtaining ammunition of any other bore. The variation in the figures of fighting strength and armaments of the tribes of the Kohat District is partly due to increase and decrease in the population and partly to internal blood feuds among the tribes. The increase of 190 in the number of L.M. rifles against Bhittanis (Dera Ismail Khan District) is due to the popularity of this fire-arm while the decrease in the M. M. rifles from 2000 to 1800 is due to the disposal of the weapons of this pattern, which has lost its popularity. The 600 L.M. rifles referred to above include both British make and the local Manufacture. 1 ENCLOSURE IN INDIA F0RF.1QM SECRETARY’S LETTER ^ at c BFr.F'Vf^ date received ^ . A. - 1QT r9 APPENDIX. . . 't Note regarding the small guns in the possession of the Nawab of Dir, Khan of Khar, the Wali of Swat and in the Khyher and South Waziristan Agencies. I.—Nawab of Dir. The Nawab’s guns were inspected during the Chitral Reliefs, 1930, by Lieutenant Howard, Commanding, Chitral M. A. Section, who reports as follows :— 1* Two 2 calibre guns probably 7-pounder, without sights of any description. Fire solid shells with a brass cartridge. Would be of no use except for saluting pur poses, used mainly as such. 2. Seven breech-loading guns of 275' of 3' calibre. Adapted for pack purposes, but loads would be too heavy for pack mule or pony—possibly could be loaded on camels. Dates of manufacture vary from 1925 to present year. Barrels rifled but very inaccurately. Breech mechanisms vary—some Lewis type, others Wellin type but very badly fitted, and would become unsafe to fire after very few full-charge rounds. All guns have a spring buffer and recuperator combined. Only two guns have any kind of spade. Only two guns have any sights at all, these are open sights and consist of a foresight (acorn shaped) on a bracket fixed to the cradle, and a backsight. The backsight consists of bar, graduated in yards and operated by a worm hand-wheel. The graduations are purely arbitrary and bear no relation to the actual shooting capabilities of the guns. The elevating gear consists of a central screw operated by a hand-wheel; similarly, the traver sing gear is the screw and slieve type. All gears are very roughly made and badly lubricated and consequently very difficult to operate. The ammunition is all fixed and has a brass cartridge. Shells, about 10 lb. in weight, are solid, and have a very roughly-made driving band. Cartridges, made of brass are very roughly shaped, and do not fit properly into the chamber and consequently split when the gun is fired. The Superintendent of the factory has no idea as to the actual ranges and accuracy of the guns. There is no connected equipment for the guns. On the whole, I consider it would be much safer to be fired at by the suns than to fire them. &lt;£ 3. As regards light automatic guns, there was one very old French ‘ Lebels ’ Mitrail- lense or Michni guns, also an Afghan-made double barrelled ‘ Gatling ’ gun. I did not see any other light automatic weapons. Both these are verv old and of little use.” II. —Khan of Khar. The Khan owns four brass guns, two of which are large, firing a solid ball 3£' calibre, 4 lb. weight, range 1,500 yards. One is medium, firing a ball 2£' calibre 2£ lbs. weight, range ’1,500 yards. One is small, firing a ball 2' calibre, 2 lb. weight, range 1,000 yards. These guns are used in inter-tribal fighting but do little damage and inspire no terror. III. —Wali of Swat. The Wali of Swat has eight guns, two of a very old pattern and four breech-loaders made m his own factory. They are used chiefly for firing salutes, but a field firing exhibition was given in February 1926 at Saidu for the benefit of the Political Agent. Solid projectiles were fired at a target on the opposite hill-side from two of the most modern guns. At a ran^e of about 1,500 yards, fair accuracy was obtained. IV. — Khyber Agency.

The prices oi rifles, both genuine and those manufactured in the Kohat Pass, show a general tendency to decrease. This is attributed by some reporting officers to be due to the fall in the ,-fghan currency exchange rates. Dealers, however, state that this fall in prices is primarily due to a decreased demand. 2 . The prices of cartridges of all sorts has increased since the preparation of the last return of current prices of arms and ammunition. This is due to the heavyexpenditure of cartridges by lashkars and raiding gangs in './aziristan, resulting in an increased demand.SECRET. &gt; ■ Is FIGHTING STRENGTH AND ARMAMENTS. The change in the figures for Gaduns (Mardan District) is due to detailed enquiries which have been verified. The reason for the change in figures relating to the tribes of-the Peshawar Dis trict is :— i X The present statement and last year's statement were both prepared by the same officer who has taken great pains to ensure accuracy in the present statement. For instance he has excluded from the fighting strength of a clan those members who reside permanently in British India and who in no circumstances would return to their country to join a lashkar, though possibly they may go back there to end their days. As regards clans whose territory lies partly under our control and partly under that of the Afghan Government, he has tried to include only those who live in territory under our control. It appears that in the past there has not been strict discrimination between those living on one side of the boundary line and the other. Maliks when questioned about the fighting strength and armament of their sections are inclined to reply in accordance with the motive which they believe to be behind the question. For instance if a malik thinks it is a matter of distributing allowances, he may be inclined to exaggerate his numbers. To meet this difficulty this year the maliks have named each man included in his fighting strength. The reason for the increase of 4,326 in the fighting strength of the Hazara border is that accurate figures have been ascertained through all the leading men of Tribal - . Territory. The increase of 3,056 B. L. rifles in the possession of the Hazara border J is due to the inflow of Kohat Pass made rifles and sale of these fire-arms at reduced i prices, and in most cases by easy instalments. The reasons for the increase and decrease in the fighting strengths and arma ments of the Right Bank Indus Kohistan tribes are :— 1. Kandia .—The number has decreased because many outsiders (Kohistanis) who had come to this country for refuge have returned to their native homes. This was verified from the jirga who had come here. 2. Malar .—The number has been corrected through their jirga. A number of people, owing to their local feuds, have gone to Jalkot, etc., and are now at their homes. Owing to their inter-tribal feuds they have purchased arms from the peaceful Kohistanis. 3. Seo. —(Raziqa). Accurate enumeration has brought the number to this figure which has been verified by the Seo jirga which came to Chakdarra. 4. Buber .—Checked through jirga. The population has since increased and was not counted correctly before. As to arms, when the Wali of Swat started to disarm Ghurband, Kana and Chakesar most of the people sent up their arms to this area fo; deposit with their friends. Later on, fearing an attack by the Wali, the Duber people purchased those rifles which were in deposit with them and hence the number in the arms has increased. General increase in Breech Loading rifles in possession of the tribes of the , Khyber Agency is due to greater numbers of modern high velocity rifles on the tribal i market. Considerable imports now come from Afghanistan where we have recently sold 5,000 rifles and much ammunition of the latest type, releasing their older arma ment. 1 »’CIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S9 C /&gt;'7 * s 'I * APPENDIX.

In view of the fact that the Deputy Director, Intelligence, has already taken over the half yearly return showing prices of Anna and Ammunition, it is suggested that inclusion of the information in this Annual Return (vide the first 3 pages of above- mentioned statement, a copy of which was forwarded to the Government of India, with this office memorandum No .4370-P.C/575-P.C.XIII, dated the 26th November, 1936) be discontinued forthwith, in order to avoid reduplication.From - The Jepwty ^ecrotary to the GxjYamment of India in the internal Affairs Dep?nrtment t To • The Ohief Seoretary to the GoYemnant of the Horth-West Frontier ProYince* Meroorandian No«F.229-F/37. iMxied dimla t the ^ October 1937 • jtawement of fitting strength and armament of trana-frontiar tribes on the North- est Frontier (Ois-jurrjnd Line)• Heferenoe your memorandum Ho*692-CTB/3-L;*T.B*I«Vol*II t dated the 8th July 1937. 2.

It has now been decided that so far as the North- est Frontier ProTince is concerned a separate return of prices current of Suropean-made rifles in tribal territory should be submitted every six months, and that information on this subject should be excluded from the annual statement of fighting strength and armament of tribes. If there is no objection it is suggested that the same practice should be followed in Baluchistan. In this case a return of prices current should be submitted half-yearly for the periods ending the 31st March and the 30 th dept amber, and the statement of the fighting strength and armament should be submitted annually as hitherto. 3.

Considerable imports now come from Afghanistan where we have recently sold 5,000 rifles and much ammunition of the latest type releasing their older armament. 'Prices have dropped sympathetically'. 2. With reference to this the Deputy Director, Intelligence, reports as follows 'Enquiries pursued by this office indicate that with the expeption of a negligible proportion, the whole of Tribal Territory armament consists of High Velocity breech loading rifles. This Office has no confirmation of the implication that rifles of older types than the S.M.L.E. .303 bore rifles supplied in 1936, have been sold and disbursed amongst the Afridis and other tribes of Tribal Territory living in the areas cis Durand Line'. 3.

A new suggested classification form has been submitted for approval and it is hoped that this will remove all difficulties and inaccuracies in future. -C Figures marked with an asterisk would appear to be the prices of second-hand weapons. A new column for G-adun territory of the Mardan District has been added.No te.- The slight decrease in the rrice of arras in Mohmand territory and in the Afridi territory under the control of the Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar, is ascribed to the general economic depression. There has been a general tendency to a slight decrease in prices throughout the whole area. This may be ascribed in part to economic depression and also to saturation. The most marked fall in prices i£ shown in those of weapons manufactured in the Kohet Pass. This is due to the fact that the tribesmen will not buy pass-mad? rifles when others arc obtainable, and much prefer French and Russian rifles of which some have been available for some time. The above figures are base-d on information which is conflicting in some cases and are therefore not as accurate as was expected. This is in part due to the modernized categories of arms which have been adopted in this return for the first time. It is hoped that more accurate figures will b ' obtainable for future returns.1^. yju. UilC^V^r. S«nisi V^, ^ (' /AvnJ , 1 &lt; ^'&gt;'’: 'i ‘ ' Va&gt;(i|',-| This Document will be c' dv^h on SECRET. Army Form A-24. Annual Return of Secret Documented 4. NOTE. PRICES. \ The increase in the price of -303 rifles in the Dera Ismail Khan district is due i to the stricter control now in force in British Territory. The decrease m the price 1 of snider rifles is due to the fact that they are very little used in Bhitanni country, • while the increase in the price of European and American revolvers of • 450 and • 455 bore and pistols is due to the increased demand for these weapons. The decrease in the prices of arms in the Peshawar District is due to the fall in the exchange rate of the Kabuli rupee and to the general economic depression. The decrease in the prices of rifles in the Khyber Agency is due to the fact ^ that a large number of old weapons has been thrown on the market by the tribes- ' men, who are attempting to purchase more modern weapons. The changes in the prices of arms and ammunition in the Kurram Agency ^ are due to the improvement in the economic condition of the people during the ' last 4 or 5 years. FIGHTING STRENGTH AND ARMAMENTS. The increase of 780 in the fighting strength of the Bhitannis (D. I. Khan District) and the increase of 159 in the number of fire-arms in their possession is due to an increase in the population. Figures relating to Sherani country (D. I. Khan District) remain unchanged. The change in the figures for Gaduns (Peshawar District) is accounted for by the fact that special care has been taken to get more accurate information. The slight increase in the armament of Afridis is said to be due to an intensification of feuds. The reasons for the large number of rifles in the possession of Baezai (Usman Khel) and Khwaezai (Peshawar District) are Usman Khel contain a considerable number of arms dealers who keep stocks for sale. Their geographical position is such that they can easily procure arms from Afghanistan and from Kuchis of Turkistan. As regards Khwaezais th : s section has a considerable number of wealthy khans who possess fairly large stocks of arms. The increase of 1,050 in the fighting strength of the Kohistanis is due to the inclusion of figures of four Ilaqas, namely, Malar, Shatial, Sazin and Somar. These Ilaqas are reported to be situated near Chilas and were not included hitherto. An increase of 5.600 rifles is due to the building of forts by the Wall of Swat at Kurmag, Basham and Labor which alarmed the Kohistanis who proceeded to purchase arms extensively. This opened up a market for the Walks own subjects who, having concealed their arms to avoid forfeiture, sold them to the Kohistanis. The increase in the fighting strength of the tribes of the Kurram Agency is due to a decrease in the mortality rate. Variations in the figures of fighting strength and armaments m the North Waziristan Agency are attributable to more accurate check and classification. The decrease in the numbers of L. E. and L. M. pattern rifles and the corresponding increase in Martini rifles is due to the fact that owing to financial stringency tribes men are selling their more expensive modern weapons and resorting to cheaper makes. MS2CSNWFP B-40387?II APPENDIX. Aote regarding the small guns in the 'possession of the Nawab of Dir, Khan of Khar, the Wali of Swat and in the Khyber and South Waziristan Agencies. I.—Nawab of Dir. Ihe Nawab’s guns were inspected during the Chitral Reliefs, 1930, by Lieutenant Howard, Commanding, Chitral M. A. Section, who reports as follows :— 1. Two 2' calibre guns probably 7-pounder, without sights of any description. Fire solid shells with a brass cartridge. Would be of no use except for saluting purposes ; used mainly as such. ‘‘ 2. Seven breech-loading guns of 275' of 3' calibre. Adapted for pack purposes, but loads would be too heavy for pack mule or pony—possibly could be loaded on camels. Dates of manufacture vary from 1925 to present year. Barrels rifled but very inaccurately. Breech mechanisms vary—some Lewis type, others Wellin type but very badly fitted, and would become unsafe to fire after very few full-charge rounds. All guns have a spring buffer and recuperator combined. Only two guns have any kind of spade. Only two guns have any sights at all, these are open sights and consist of a foresight (acorn shaped) on a bracket fixed to the cradle, and a backsight. The backsight consists of bar, graduated in yards and operated by a worm hand-wheel. The graduations are purely arbitrary and bear no relation to the actual shooting capabilities of the guns. The elevating gear consists of a central screw operated by a hand-wheel ; similarly, the traver sing gear is the screw and slieve type. All gears are very roughly made and badly lubricated and consequently very difficult to operate. The ammunition is all fixed and has a brass cartridge. Shells, about 10 lb. in weight, are solid, and have a very roughly-made driving band. Cartridges, made of brass are very roughly . shaped, and do not fit properly into the chamber and consequently split when the gun is fired. The Superintendent of the factory has no idea as to the actual ranges and accuracy of the guns. There is no connected equipment for the guns. On the whole, I consider it would be much safer to be fired at by the guns, than to fire them. “ 3. As regards light automatic guns, there was one very old French ‘ Lebels ’ Mitrail leuse or Michni guns, also an Afghan-made doubled barrelled ' Gatling ’ gun. I did not see any other light automatic weapons. Both these are very old and of little use.” II.— Khan of Khar. The Khan owns four brass guns, two of which are large, firing a solid ball 3|' calibre, 4 lb. weight, range 1,500 yards. One is medium, firing a ball 2£' calibre 2| lbs. weight, range 1,500 yards. One is small, firing a ball 2' calibre, 2 lb. weight, range 1,000 yards. These guns are used in inter-tribal fighting but do little damage and inspire no terror. III.— Wali of Swat. The Wali of Swat has eight guns, two of a very old pattern and four breech-loaders made in his own factory. They are used chiefly for firing salutes, but a field firing exhibition was given in February 1926 at Saidu for the benefit of the Political Agent. Solid projectiles were fired at a target on the opposite hill-side from two of the most modern guns. At a range of about 1,500 yards, fair accuracy was obtained. IV.— Khyber Agency. Khan Bahadur Nawab Malik Zaman Khan, his rival Swatai, and their supporters among Udredunki Kuki Khels possess some guns . (a) Khan Bahadur Nawab Malik Zaman Khan .. .. .. 2 (b) Swatai .. • • • • * * * • * ’ ’ ’ ’ ^ (c) Mirak, Zardad, Sahar Gul and Gul Akbar (one each) .. .. 4 (а) Breech-loading rifled gun of 3' calibre with carriage local make. (б) Breech-loading rifled gun but fired by a match from the touch-hole—length of barrel 6' and calibre 3'. (c) Country-made muzzle-loading guns. Only two of those guns are serviceable. They are used by the Nawab and Swatai in bom barding each other’s villages when at feud.Y.—South Waziristan Agency. Two machine-grins have been imported from Afghanistan by Mulla Fazal Din, Shabi Khel Malisud. A ‘ : ^ ^ VI.— North Waziristan Agency. The gun possessed by Malik Khandan Khan, s/o the late K. 8. Zangi Khan, Madda Khel, has got wMs and front and back sights. It is a country-made gun and rs unpackabhn Calibre is between three and four inches.

In continuation of my memorandum No.5457-P/5/47-II, rifles in tribal country for the half year ending the 30th June 1935 is enclosed. The variations in prices in the Peshawar District are due to the scarcity of money and fall in trade. The decrease in prices in the Khyber Agency and Hazara District is due to the economic depression. The reason for the fall of price in North Waziristan is due to the increase in the exchange rate of the Kabuli rupee. The small decrease in cost of Martini Henry rifles (Bhittani) is due to a smaller demand for such rifles. The reasons for the decrease of price in Malakand Agency is due to foreign rifles {Russian German, etc) of bolt action being obtainable at very reasonable rates. The reasons for the increase in the cost of .303 rifles in ,he Kurram is due to their being more popular.

In this case he seems to have continued the use of the designation he bore while a member of the Kurram-Ehost Commission after the Commission had broken up. Enquiries from the Afghan Foreign Office show that his use of this designation was without authority and that since the termination of the Commission he has held no executive post. the letter was Haji Nawab Khan appears to the Government of India after further enquiry to be wrong, it is requested that this Legation may be informed accordingly in order that further enquiries may be made here. enclosurf in i INDIA FOREIGN Sr''-AHY'S Arrest at Shewa of thre6 Gian Khel Zadrans with .303 rifles.

A lecture on the North-West Frontier filled the hall of the Royal United Service Institution to-day with an expert and alert audience. The lecturer, Major-General S. F. Muspratt, spoke of the frontier as providing the most difficult and acute military problem in the world to-day, as well as supplying an administrative and political problem of great delicacy. There are not far short of half a million fighting men among the frontier tribes, and of these perhaps as many as 200,000 are reasonably well armed—that is, carrying weapons not below the Vartini-Henry standard. Fortunately, tribal life is not conducive to concerted action or cohesion, and the air arm, by rendering no tribe or section inaccessible, is a great disciplinarian. Questions were asked whether the tribesmen still rely on British troops for a supply of (stolen) rifles, and whether they are adopting modern weapons, such as automatics and machine-guns. The lecturer's reply was that supplies stolen from British troops and supplies obtained from the 1 ersian Gulf are negligible nowadays. Anarchy in Afghanistan a few years ago dispersed large quantities of rifles and ammunition among the tribesmen, and “ knocked the bottom out of the market ” for traffic in illicit arms and munitions. Automatics and machine-guns have little attraction for tribesmen because of the amount of ammunition they require.-272 D SECRET. I ^Jy \&gt; 7 i . i * • 14S0 t \ Demi-official letter from Captain R.

The Deputy Commissioner, Kohat, interviewed a jirga of the Pass tribes for the purpose of negotiations with them to stop the manufacture of short shot gun in their factories. The attitude of the jirga was excellent and they readily agreed to give an undertaking not to manufacture weapons of this sort. In view of their ready compliance and obvious desire to accede to the Government demands, a fine of Rs. 100 only was imposed in the case of any person found manufacturing this type of weapon. 3. The undertaking was signed by every section of the Pass Afridis and a copy is enclosed. We the Maliks of the Bosti Khel, Sheraki, Tor Chappar, Zarghun Khel and Akhorwal Pass Afridis agree that the construction of the short shot gun of any bore (that is less than 2 feet in length) is injurious to the interests of Government and to our own interests. In token of our friendship with Government we undertake that if any man be found manufacturing such a short shot gun, he will be liable to a fine of Rs. 100 out of which Rs. 50 will be paid to Government and Rs. 50 will go to the section.

I—KttYBER. 1, On 28 October, the telegraphic communication between Landi Khana and Torkham (Afghanistan) was resumed. 2. (£) During the earlier part of the w T eek under report, news was insistent that at the weekly jirga at Bagh on Priday, 31 October, a decision would be reached regarding the raising of a lashkar to attack, either the military camps in the Kajuri plain or else to risk all on a large scale incursion into the Peshawar District. However, when the jirga. was held it came to no conclusive decision. (ii) The jirga was attended by about 1,500 elders and Khilafatists of the Malikdin Khel, Kambar Khel, and Zakha Khel of Tirah and the Bara ; representatives from the other sections were conspicuously absent. The proceedings resolved themselves into a trial of strength between the Government elders and the Khilafat leaders, led by Khushal Khan. It was agreed eventually to give the elders full authority until next Fri lay to find some solution for the present situation. Another jirga is to be held at Pateh Garhi on Monday, 3 November. All reports received by the Political Agent were unanimous that the influence of the Khilafat leaders had declined and that popularity of their cause had decreased. (iii) During the week parties of tribesmen, numbering altogether between 500 to 600, were reported in the Shin Kamr hills, and some sniping on the 9th Brigade camp at Miri Khel occurred. 3. So far no reliable information has been received that there has been any general movement of families from Afridi Tirah to neighbouring areas. 4. On 27 October, the Deputy Commissioners, Peshawar and Kohafc, proclaimed a blockade under section 21, Frontier Crimes Regulation, against the following Afridi sections :— (1) Qambar Khel. (2) Malikdin Khel. (3) Tirahwal Kuki Khel. (4) Zakha Khel (excluding Pakhai of the Khyber Pass). (5) Kamarai. (6 ) Si pah. (7) Aka Khel. (8) Tirah Adam Khel. 5. (&lt;') On the morning of 29 October, Nur Akhmad, Loargi Shinwari of Landi Kotal, was stabbed in the Dabgari Bazar, Peshawar City, by Malan Jan, son of Lalagai of Ningrahar. At the end of the week, Nur Akhmad was alive, though his injuries may prove fatal. The assailant was arrested on the spot by the police. (ii) Nur Akhmad has charged. Malik Murad Khan and his son Saida Khan with abetment, their motive being the charge they made against him for complicity in the murder of the late Khan Bahadur Malik Mir Akbar Khan, Loargi Shinwari, father of Malik Murad Khan, on the night of 2/3 September 1929, vide para graph I (3) of Diary No. 35 of 1929. 6.

All the Wazir as well as Gurbaz Jciris have left Shawal and have come down to their winter places. 5. A big kiri of Ghilzais passed through the agency during the week under report. 6. Another even larger kiri of Ghilzais arrived at Miranshah on 31 October en route to Bannu. Ill (6 )—South Waziristan. 1. The Shabi Khel Maliks assembled at Marobi to settle the feud between the sons of the late Mulla Powindah and the Pashakai Marobi Shabi [Khel of Marobi village. A temporary settlement was effected. 2. A feud is being actively pursued between two sections of Kai Khel in the Upper Shinkai (between Sararogha and Kaniguram). Some shooting took place on 24 October and two bullocks were killed. The participants are unable at present to leave their towers. 3. On 27 October, two Nekzan Khel, Mahsud sowars deserted from Sarwakai. Some Nekzan Khel Maliks who had been ordered to Sarwakai for 28 to attend a jirga to settle some Wazir cases failed to appear. Action is being taken. 4. On 26 October, a flock of sheep belonging to the Zilli Khel Wazirs was driven off the Spin plain by Dotannis. Information was late^^- in being received but a gasht of the South W^ziristan Scouts was sent out on 27 to see what could be done. This party on reaching the Sher- khanna Narai (the Narai between Spin and the Toi River) was heavily fired on from the hills towards the Toi and was unable to advance. One Wazir who was with the Scouts was wounded. The Scouts returned the fire and as it afterwards transpired, inflicted two casualties. They retired to Tanai after dark. The following morning baramptas were carried out. The Frontier Constabulary detachment at Nili Kaoh seized six Suleiman Khel with their rifles and have sent them into Tank. A South Waziristan Scouts detachment marched from Tanai to Khajuri (sixteen miles) seized thirty-five Dotannis with fifteen rifles. These Dctannis were marching to Nili from Khajuri and were near the Gwalerai Narai. The Scouts brought these prisoners to Tanai the same day arriving at 20 , 00 hours. Another detachment of the South Waziristan Scouts proceeded to Tanai by lorry and marched for the scene of the previous day’s engagement. They traced empty cartridge cases of Russian and British make to a large Dotanni encampment at Spalipan on the Toi River. The Dotanni village numbered some 800 or 900 men. No opposition was encounter ed. The hostages demanded from the Maliks were brought into Tanai after the Scouts had spent the night at Toi Khula. The case is being dealt with. IV— Dera Ismail Khan.

It is reported that messengers from the Tirah Khilafatists visited certain Jowaki Maliks, asking them to attend a, jirga to be held in Tirah to discuss the present situation.

The Janakor Maliks also expressed their inability to join in any discussion, but are reported to have3 SrSTT North West Frontier Provincial Diary No. 44 for the week endiug 1 November 1930. 1 S '^s&amp;ent one of their Mullas, one Ahmad Gul, to Tirah. VII—Peshawar. 1. Reference paragraph VII (3) of Diary No. 43. On 25 October, Malik Mukasil, on his arrival in Pandiali, disclosed his ostensible object in coming to Lower Mohmand country to be that he wished to enlist khassadars from the Lower Mohmand sections in order to protect the Gandab and Alikandi trade routes if the Khyber Pass were closed. Subsequently, on the morning of 29 October, he was joined in Pandi ali by the Haji of Turangzai himself. The object of the Haji seems to be identical, but the conversations were carried on by Malik Muhasil, The Haji and Muhasil did not appear to have met with a very cordial recep tion from the Isa Khelor the Burhan Khel in Pandiali where they were told that khassadars could not be enlisted. On 30 October, informa tion was received that both the Haji and Muhasil were proceeding to Halki Pandiali towards Michni. Malik Muhasil reached Khatki-Killi, a village one and a half miles from Michni Fort that evening, the Haji himself remainitfg in or near Ghallanai in the Gandab Valley. Muhasil held with the Tarakzai and appears to have received some encouragement from the young men of the tribe who said that they would give khassadars, 2. As yet it is uncertain whether the enlistment of khassadars was the true object of the visit, or whether it was designed to test the attitude of the Lower Assured Clans after that the negotiations of August and September. 3. A final jirga of the Hassan Khel and Asho Khel was interviewed by the Deputy Commissioner on 30 October. They were presented with written orders regarding the attitude to be observed by them. They were informed that Government would not countenance any attempt by them to make a tribal sarishta with the Tirah Afridis or Orakzais living to the west of the Kohat Pass Road. They were warned also that they would not be permitted to allow those tribes to enter their limits for purposes hostile to Government and that they were prohibited from passing supplies or commodities through their limits for the benefit of the Tirah Afridis. They were informed that Government still held them responsible for adhering to their agreement of 1923 regarding outlaws, As regards the case arising out of the raid on Akbarpura on 22 .Tune 1930, and other cases pending against them, they were told that these would be referred to joint jirgas. Finally it was announced that Government undertook to consider a suggestion by the Hassan Khel and Asho Khel that the khassadars required of them should be found from the Frontier Constabu lary provided that the sections could produce acceptable recruits in their places within one month. The names of all the Maliks were recorded and they stated that they would endeavour to carry out the orders of Government. 4. The well-known outlaw ex- Subedar Zarif Khan, late of the Guides Infantry, surrendered unconditionally to the Joint Deputy Commissioner on 22 October, at Topi. He absconded in 1914 after committing three murders and has recently been in the employ of the Nawab of Amb. VIII—Hazara. fight of 1.

The Mamunds and those Salarzais who are in favour of the Khan of Khar are endeavouring to effect a compromise between the Khan of Khar and Zarawar Khan of Kotki Oharmang, with the ultimate intention of raising a lashkar against the Nawab of Dir. There is little likelihood of the compromise being effected. 5. Reference paragraph VII (4) of Diary No. 43. MuhammadA Alamzeb Khan reached Jar Ambahar on 26 October.

The decrease in price North of the Kurrarn is due to the flooding of the country with rifles looted from Jalalabad etc., These are not readily obtainable by Wazirs as the Kurram Valley routes have been watched and all Afghan routes were closed. At the same time ov^ing to the Afghan disturbances there was a demand for rifles in the Southern area, which was cut off from ordinary sources of supply viz. Kabul and time Kohat Pass.

The prices current in the tribal areas in the North West Frontier Prorince are shown in the acoompauying statement. Hazara. —The price of country-made rifles was lower owing to the fact that a large number of these rifles was brought for sale by Pass Afridis. Dtr, Swat and Chitral. —The popularity of cheap pass-made weapons has reduced the demand for ‘303 rifles, British pattern, which declined in price, the maximum falling from B.s. 1,000 to Rs. 600. North Wasiristan. —There was a decrease in the price of *303 M. H. and Snider rifles, which is attributed to the unpopularity of these kinds of weapons. Dera Ismail Khan. —The general decrease in the price of rifles of all kinds in Bhitanni country is due to a shortage of money and the present peaceful conditions on the frontier. Ammunition continues scarce and has risen in price accordingly. Fighting strengths and armament. Hazara border. —There has been a slight increase in the number of •303 (bolt action) and M. H. rifles. Dir, Swat and Chitral. —The increase in the number of *303 rifles with His Highness the Mehtar of Chitral is due to the grant to him of obsolete Scouts rifles for the use of his bodyguard. Peshawar. —The increase in the number of *303 rifles with the Mohmands is due to the universal desire for better class weapons. Ehyber i Kohat and North Waziristan. —The fighting strengths and armament of the Afridis, Orakzai, Utmanzai and Ahmadzai Wazirs have been carefully checked and revised where necessary. In the the case of the armament of the North Waziristan tribes the preference of the tribes for magazine rifles of a British S. M. L. E. pattern and calibre which can be bought fairly easily in Afghanistan or obtained thence, has resulted in a decrease in the number of L. E., L. M. and M. M. rifles. Dera Ismail Khan. —The increase in the fighting strength and armament of trans-border Bhitannis is due mainly to the fact that the previous years’ figures appear to have included only those under the political jurisdiction of the Deputy Commissioner, Dera Ismail Khan. The figures for the Dhana Bhitannis in the jurisdiction of the Deputy Commissioner, Bannu, have now been added.2 I Prices of rifles anp/ r\ 4 Statement of fighting strengths and armament of transfrontier tribes on the North West Frontier (cis-Durand Line) corrected to 1st April 1928 (Compiled in the Office of the Chief Commissioner, North West Frontier Province )Statement of fighting strengths and armament of transjrontier tribes on the North W'est Frontier {cis-Durand Line) corrected to 1st April 1928 —continued10 APPENDIX ■t- Note regarding the small guns in the possession of the Nawab of Dir, the Khan of Khar, the Wali of Swat and in the Khyber and South Waziristan Agencies.

In the Kurram the price has remained stationary, but south of the Kurram there has actually been a rise (in Horth Waairistan from Es. 600/- to Es. 700/-, and in South Jaairistan from I&lt;s. 800/- to is. 900/-) though in the Bhittani area there has been a drop from Es. 1000/- to Es. 8o0/-. 'The Government of India would be glad of your views on the reason for the marked difference in the effects of the Afghan civil war on arms prices north and south of the Kurram. Off-hand none suggests itself here, unless it be that the overflow of the loot of Jalalaoad arsenal fell exclusively into the hands of the northern tribes who have not yet started re-selling&gt; possibly owing to their uneasiness over the Cniah Sunni and the 1 ohmand-Shinwari troubles.

[Demi-official.] No. 4709-PCN-155, dated tlie 11th September 1922. From—C. Latimer, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Hon’ble the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province. In continuation of Griffith’s demi-official letter No. 2254-PSN, dated the 17th July 1922, I am desired to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a note by Ewart on the present position of the armament of Frontier Tribes. Note on the present position of the Armament of Frontier Tribes. 1. Generally speaking prices are falling ; the only exception are popular patterns, such as the “ Bandari ’’Martini Henry, supplies of which are not up to demand. The figures supplied ii by the Political Agents of fighting strength and armament are unreliable, but there is no doubt ll that the total of arms possessed has greatly increased both in quality and quantity. 2. The old Persian Gulf trade of 1909 to 1914 ceased with the commencement of the war and fresh sources of supply were not immediately open. From 1919 onwards this condition has changed and the following sources of supply of arms now exist :— (а) The Kohat Pass and other local factories are still turning out large numbers of • 450 and • 303 rifles and, though prices rule low, there is still a good market for these arms, especially among the most backward (in the armament sense) tribes of the northern border. (б) Losses of all sorts from troops on active service-on the Frontier. These were very large in 1919-20, and these losses are by no means balanced by subsequent recoveries—but have decreased in 1921-22. It is to be hoped that this source of supply may now be safely merged in :— (c) Theft by professional arms thieves—Ut Khels, Mamund Bajauris, etc. Some 35 rifles of modern military pattern were stolen from regiments in India in 1921. This, once the main source of supply of arms to the Tribes, is now a very subsidiary one. It is capable of practical extinction if the Criminal Investigation Depart ment, Arms Section, is efficiently worked and suffi ciently financed . The profits to be obtained by the't and sale of first class rifles are great, but can be out weighed by the risks, if we really set ourselves to stop this particular branch of the trade. (d) Afghanistan. The re-armament of the Afghan Army with modern rifles bought in Em-opc—already about 20,000 have been bought, apart from a large number ‘ handed over or likely soon to be handed over by the Russians under their treaty and extensive further purchases in progress in Europe—will throw on the market the present Afghan military rifles. Whatever diplomatic steps may be taken to hinder such a result, nothing will prevent these rifles reaching the Frontier tribes if there is a demand for them. Further, there is a distinct possibility of the private importation of arms to Afghanistan by speculators for sale to the tribes. We have already had rumours of the arrival of consign ments of this nature from Germany and there is no doubt that various people, e.g., the German- returned ex-Havildar Guli Jan, Afridi, have dreams of a profitable trade in this direction. (e) Persia, Turkistan and the Middle East generally have been flooded with arms during the war. British, Turco-German and Russian armies have littered countless battle-fields with rifles which local inhabitants have afterwards collected. In Turkistan particularly armies have disintegrated and sold or abandoned their arms locally/ Finally, in the process of backing tottering governments and infruc- tuous counter revolutions, the British Government has distributed huge quantities of arms and ammunition, often among populations not normally martial, who are only too keen to turn their rifles, through the medium of cash, into ploughshares or bread on the first opportunity. Though I have no special information on this point, I believe Mesopotamia is full of rifles, in spite of large surrenders in 1920-21. At present local conditions may keep most of these in Arab hands, but already we have authenticated instances of Wazirs and Afridis (and I believe, Baluchis) going to Persia to buy the “ Kermani ” rifles, which have already appeared and for which a great demand has been created on the Frontier. The original “ Kermani ” rifle is a Mk. 1 Lee Enfield of 1900 manufacture and appears to be the abandoned armament of the late South Persian Rifles. As such the supply is strictly limited, but the demand having been P 4482 I 19221 2 created, enterprising traders from the Frontier can be relied upon to go further afield to meet it and will draw upon other supplies in Persia with the probable result that sooner, rather than later, they will get in touch with Mesopotamian sources of supply. Similarly, we have authenticated cases of the import of arms from Turkistan (a) by Kuchis who ply their camels for hire in Northern Afghanistan in the summer and'on the Frontier in the winter, (b) by parties of Mohmands, Bajauris and even Wazirs who have been up to Turkistan themselves and bought rifles for about Its. 150 which they have sold for Rs. 400 or Rs. 500 in Independent Territory. 3. The above survey of possibilities shows that there is a field for a special enquiry over a wide range to determine the extent of available supplies and the probable future of the Frontier Arms Trade. Personally 1 consider that the results of such enquiry would be of little more than academic interest. Our present information is of a general nature only, but it is sufficient to show that great sources of supply exist. Diplomatic and Consular officials in Afghanistan and Persia might with advantage be-placed in possession of a summary of the position and asked to do what they can to hinder the traffic in arms by Frontier Pathans ; but this is not a case like that of the Persian Gulf trade, which we can kill by a definite cordon. No diplomatic or preven tive, measures which are feasible can seriously interfere with the natural law of supply and demand. In proportion as Central Asia and the Middle East returns to a state of peace, so will the demand for implements of war contract till only a few communities such as the Kurds and the Frontier Pathans, will furnish the demand to meet the large available supply. Nothing that we can do can prevent our Independent tribes getting all the arms they want increasingly cheaper for several years to come. 4. These prospects are of great importance to the military and Political administration of the Frontier and must be faced. Our preventive resources in India can only concentrate (a) on the intelligence side of the problem, (6) the prevention of professional theft in India, (c) the pre vention of attempts by revolutionary associations in India, such as the Akali Sikhs, for instance, to obtain arms on the frontier. Such attempts will range from the individual purchase of revolvers, etc., to the smuggling of arms emanating from Bolshevik sources. (Sd.) J. M. EWART, • Intelligence Bureau, Peshawar. G. M. Fress, Simla.—No. C.-416-F.D.—2N9-22—30—KA'.M.The figures in the foregoing statement show that the prices of arms and ammunition in the Khyber have remained stationary. In the Kohat Pass there has been a general increase in the prices of most kinds of arms, among which the following are the most marked. prices of the Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield military rifles (old pattern) have risen from Rs. 500 to Rs. 600, and those of the long and the short (new pattern) from Rs. 700 to Rs. 900 and from Rs. 800 to Rs. 1,000 each respectively Ihe most marked increase, 100 per cent., is in the price of the Martini-Met ore rifle *303 (European Gulf pattern), which has risen from Rs. 200 to Its. 400 Regarding Martini-Henry rifles, the long lever pattern was fetching Rs. 400 instead of Rs. 300, and the European (Gulf) pattern Rs. 300 instead of Rs. 2^0. Mauser rifles were selling for Rs. 500 compared with Rs. 360. There has been a general increase also in the price of ammunition in the Pass. On the other hand there has been practically no change in the Orakzai prices either as regards arms or ammunition. Prices in the TVhna and Tochi Agencies remain stationary. The marked rise in the Kohat Pass prices is due, no doubt, mainly to the prohibition placed upon the export of iron from British territory as well as to the stoppage of the Gulf traffic. In connection with this it is of interest to note that the Political Agent, Tochi, reports that muzzle-loaders among the trans- border tribes of that Agency have been scrapped iu large numbers, the barrels being sold in the Pass. Eigsting Strengths and Armaments. Black Mountain tribes. —There is a slight increase in the fighting strength and armament of these tribes, the result of bad feeling amongst them, and especially of the feud between the Isazai and Swathi over the Swathi village of Chirmang. Tribes of the Malakand Agency.—The variations in fighting strength and armament among the tribes of this Agency are not very noticeable except among the Dirwals, among whom the most marked rise is in the number of Martini-Henry rifles with the Khwazazai and Malizai clans, who are at constant war with one another. Peshawar and Khyber tribes—There is no appreciable change in the fighting strengths and armaments of these tribes. Kohat tribes—The decrease in the number of rifles among the Adam Khel (Jowakis, &amp;c.) of the Kohat Pass, especially Lee-Enfield, Lee-Metford, and Martini-Henry, is said to be due to the purchase of these rifles at high prices by Wazirs and Afghans. Kurram tribes.—There is no change in these figures. JVaziristan tribes—The slight variations in the estimates of the Tochi Agency tribes strength are probably due to more careful checking. There is nothing very noticeable in the armament figures apart from a rise in those for * non-classed * breech-loaders among the Utmanzais, and another verv considerable decrease in muzzle-loaders, due, as remarked above, to the scrapping of them for sale as iron to the Kohat Pass dealers. The Mahsud figures, however, which have been very carefully checked by the Political Agent, Wana, show a marked increase of about 29 per cent, in fighting strength, the total being now estimated at 14,360, while Martini-Henry rifles have more than doubled, having risen from 2,740 to 6,460! The popularity of this rifle among the Mahsuds is now undisputed owing to its simplicity, cheapness, and the facilities for obtaining ammunition for it. There has been a slight increase in the armament of the Sheranis.An examination of the figures given above shows that the price of arms and ammunition in. the Khyber has increased, except in the case of Jong Lee- Metford and Lee-Enfield rifles, Sniders (British Military), small-bore Magazine rifles or repeaters of foreign make, small automatic pistols, and Kabul-made ammunition for Sniders. The Political Agent, Khyber, remarks that there is a | scarcity of Sniders of other European patterns imported through the Gulf, that the popularity of Mauser pistols is decreasing, and that the rise in the price of ammunition for small-bore Magazine rifles or repeaters of foreign make is also due to scarcity. In Mohmand country the price of short Lee-Enfield rifles is as much as Us. 1,200. In the Kohat Pass there has been a general decrease in the price of most kinds of arms as a result of the large increase in local manufacture. The only exceptions are Mauser rifles and'revolvers, the price of both of which has risen. The price of the Lee-Enfield Military rifles (old pattern) has dropped from Rs. 630 to Rs. 500, the long new pattern from Rs. 800 to Rs. 700, and the short rifle from Rs. 900 to Rs. 800. The price of ammunition of all kinds has in creased, except of Military ammunition for Lee-Metford, Lee-Enfield, Martini-Metford and Sniders, of Kabul ammunition for Sniders, and of Wehley revolver ammunition. The Deputy Commissioner reports that about 600 rifles of local manufacture are in stock for sale. There has been a slight increase in the price of one or two kinds of arms and ammunition in Orakzai country. In the Tochi Agency the price paid for breech-loading rifles varies from Rs. 800 for English *303 Magazine rifles to Rs. 70 for a Kohat Pass-made weapon. Prices in the Wana Agency remain stationary. Effect of Operations for the Suppression of the Arms Trade. Consignments of rifles and ammunition from the Persian Gulf con tinued to be received i a Kabul during the year, and parties of Adam Khel gun-runners returned to tribal country with Gulf rifles. The trade in Kohat Pass-made rifles continued brisk during the year, but the extension of the Government of India, Commerce ami Industry, Notification No. 80-W., dated 8th January 1916, prohibiting the export of all material for the manufacture of rifles, created a decided sensation in the Pass. In $ consequence the price of rifles has risen by 40 per cent. Fighting Strengths and Armaments. Black Mountain Tribe *.—The TIassanzai are chiefly responsible for the increase in Martini-Henry rifles : this is again reported to he due to their feud with the Nawab of Arab. The remaining figures, most of which show a slight increase, call for no comment. Tribes of the Malakand Agency .—Owing to the disturbed state of the country, the Political Agent has not been able to revise the figures given by him last year. Information regarding the arms in possession of the tribes in Chitral has been entered for the first time. The figures given in the column for “ muzzle loading rifles ” relate to country matchlock guns, and the Mehtar has pointed out that the number quoted is merely an estimate, and that many of these guns, as well as Enfield rifles, are quite unserviceable. Teshawar Tribes .—There is a decrease in the fighting strength of the Bunerwals. As compared with last year, there is a noticeable increase in the number of Martini-Henry and unclassed rifles and a decrease in the number of muzzle-loading rifles.The fighting strength of the Mohmands shows an increase. There is also a very noticeable decrease in the number of Lee-Enfield. Lee-Metford and Martini-Metford rifles in the case of Mohmands under British control, and to a less degree in the case of those not under British control, but this is to a great extent counterbalanced by the large increase in the number of Martini-Henry rifles with both classes. J The figures for Bunerwals and Mohmands have been revised in the light of information obtained by the district officers during the risings of last year. Khyber Tribes .—difference between the figures now given and those quoted last year may be attributed to the fact that in. connection with the new distribution of the Afridi allowances, the Bolitioal Agent has been able to check and revise the figures for the tribal fighting strength and armament. Kohnt Tribes .—There is a marked increase in the number of Martini- Henry rifles among the Adam Khel (Jowakis, &amp;c.) of the Kohat Pass. The figures for the Biland Kbel have been entered for the first time. Kurram Tribes .—number of Martini-Henry rifles in the possession of the tribes has very largely increased, and it is possible the number was under-estimated last year : the greater number of these trifles is made in the Kohat Pass. There is a large decrease in the number of muzzle-loading rifles, and amongst the Para Chamkannis these weapons have almost disappeared, most of them having, it is said, been sold to Hazaras. TTaziristan Tribes .—The figures for the Utmanzai Wazirs of the To^hi Agency have been arranged according to the three main divisions of the tribe, riz., Mohmit Khel, Ibrahim Khel and Wali Khel. It will he observed that the aggregate numbers of fighting men have increase ! in all three of the tribal divisions dealt with, though certain sections of the Ahmadzai Wazirs show substantial decreases. The most notable growth in strength is shown bv the Hathi Khel, and it must be assumed that the numbers of the clan have been under-estimated during the past few years. As regards armament, the considerable diminution in the number of *303 rifles, Sniders and unclassed breech-loaders is explained by the fact that ammunition for these classes of weapons has been practically unobtainable. Ibis circumstance has added to the popularity of the Martini-Henry rifle, the larger number of which are manufactured in the Kohat Pass. The reason for the decrease in the armament of the Mad ia Khel is probably to be found in the relaxation of their feud with the Mahsuds, while, on the other hand, the Tori Khel are still distrustful of their old enemy. The muzzle-loading rifle, especially among the Utmanzai Wazirs of the Tochi Agency, has almost ceased to be regarded as a weapon of precision, and large numbers have been sold during the year to Marwats of the Bannu District. Last year’s figures for the Wana Agency have been repeated, as the Political Agent has been unable to make satisfactory enquiries this year. There has been a slight increase in-the armament of the Sheranis and in the fighting strength of the Mianis.SECRET- NOTE. /'''N r~\ Prices.

The prices obtainable for rifles trans-border are governed very largely by the scarcity or abundance of ammunition, and the difficulty in obtaining cartridges for these rifles has no doubt deterred purchasers from offering more for them. The same reason has operated in the case of those weapons, whether rifles or pistols, of which the value is shown to have fallen. In the tribal country along the Khost border the prices both of rifles and ammunition have fluctuated con siderably owing to the disturbances in Khost. At the beginning of the outbreak there was a strong demand in Khost for arms and ammunition, but the success of the insurrection placed a quantity of looted rifles and cartridges on the market. The price of rifles thus went down, only to rise again when the Afghan authori ties began to press for the return of the arms captured by the tribesmen. This later advance in price was accentuated amongst the Mahsuds, as the Powindahs brought down very little ammunition for sale during the autumn migration. Amongst the Orakzais it is reported that the prices of arms and ammuni tion show little change. It is at first sight somewhat surprising that the price of the latter has not increased, as hostilities throughout the year have been active amongst the Orakzais and in the Kohat Pass. But no doubt the traffic in ammunition by the Amir's troops as well as the traffic in ammunition taken from the troops by the rebellious tribesmen, to which reference has been made above, have had their effect in making the market less stringent. As regards particular makes of rifles, Mausers and Mannlichers are not popular, and Snider rifles continue to find a market only with difficulty on account of the shortage of Snider ammunition. Effect of Operations for the Suppression of the Arms Trade. The effect of these operations continues to be marked. Amongst the Afridis there was practically no traffic in arms with the Persian Gulf during the past year, but so desirous were the tribesmen to obtain rifles imported by this route that on receipt of messages from Kabul that a consignment of rifles had arrived there, large numbers of tribesmen made the journey to the Afghan capital in spite of the fact that it was the hot season of the year. They were disappointed, however, and, as far as could be ascertained, only some sevenLee-Metfords were obtained. The Kohat Pass rifle trade continues to flourish as the result of the suppression of the Gulf trade, and great numbers of locally manufactured weapons have been imported into Afghan territory, where Mangals, Zadrans and other Khost tribes have been arming. One consignment of 17 Pass^made Martini-Henry rifles and one Pass-made Lee-Metford rifle was seized in the Kurram on its way to Khost. Amongst the Mahsuds and tribes in the M r ana Agency the small increase in their armament, which would otherwise have advanced rapidly, is undoubtedly due to the blockade. Fighting Strengths and Armaments. Black Mountain tribes .—The fighting strength of the Isazai clans, as reported this year, shows a large increase as compared with the numbers for 3911-12. The increase occurs in the figures for the Madda Khel tribe, the Hasanzai being credited with a small decrease and the Akazai total remainin r stationary. The Madda Khel are now reported to have a fighting strength of 8,500 as against 2,200 last year. The variation in the figures is a large one, but is reported to be the result of further and more detailed enquiries from the tribe concerned than were practicable last year. It must be received with some reserve, as the Hasanzai are usually stated to be a more numerous tribe than the Madda Khel. The slight increase in the Chagharzai figures calls for no special comment. In the case of the Swathis, the totals for this year are reported to be 19,000 as against 22,000 last year, the explanation of the decrease being that the figures given are the result of repeated personal enquiries from prominent men of all the sections concerned, and that the attendance of all sections at the payment of the annual allowances furnished ample opportunity for a detailed enquiry, which was impracticable last year owing to the absence of the tribes. A comparison of the armament figures for the past and present years is ditficult, as the variations reported are both numerous and considerable. It will appear from the statement that the total number of breech-loading rifled weapons among all the tribes has decreased by 263. On the other hand, the number of muzzle-loading rifles is reported to have largely increased, but as there is reason to suppose that the inflated numbers are due to confusion in the minds of the tribesmen between jezails and muzzle-loading rifles, it has been thought advisable to retain last year’s figures pending further enquiries. The number of ‘303 rifles is small, but shows an increase of nearly 60 per cent., probably due to the fact that Martini-Metford rifles were not distinguished from Martini- Henry rifles last year. The number of Martini-Henry rifles legitimately classed as such is practically the same as last year. Actually, apart from change in classification, there has probably been an increase of about 50 rifles, which calls for no special mention. Tribes of Malakand Agency .—The alterations in the figures in the present statement as compared with the report for the preceding year must be attributed to the change in the method of the collection of the statistics and not to any other cause. They have been compiled on a system of averages from a large number of reports from unconnected sources, and the Political Agent, Dir, Swat and Chitral, thinks that they may be taken to be approximately accurate. It will be noticed that figures for the Jinki Khel of Ghurband and Kana, Azi Khel of Chakesar, Babuzai of Puran, and Mians of Lalurai have been in cluded for the first time. Peshawar tribes .—Last year’s figures have been repeated, as they are believed to represent the actual situation with as much accuracy as it is possible to attain. Khyber tribes .—There is no appreciable change in the fighting strength or armament of the tribes this year as compared with last year, and the remarks made last year regarding the condition of the rifles in rhe hands of the Afridis still apply. The efficiency of the weapons possessed by them continues to deteriorate.( 4 ) ■ ■■ Kohat (ribes .—The general increase in the fighting strength and arma ment may be regarded as normal, and calls for no special remarks. The Ismailzai are credited with 100 fighting men extra on account of the Khadizai, who, it is believed, have not previously been taken into consideration. An addition of 60 has also been made to the Muhammad Khel, who were, it is thought, under-estimated last year. As regards armaments, there has been an increase all round in the Martini-Henry rifles in the possession of the tribesmen. Muzzle-loaders have almost ceased to exist. The figures for the Orakzais in general show a high ratio of rifles to the fighting strength of the tribe as compared with the proportions shown for other tribes on the frontier. The duration and virulence of the Gar Samil feud is doubtless responsible for this proportion, which, it is believed, is approximately correct. TFaziristan tribes .—Amongst the Tochi tribes no appreciable increase in either the number of fighting men or of their arms has occurred. Nor has there been an alteration in the price of rifles. The figures for the year under review are therefore the same as for last year. of the Political in the number of The fighting strength of the tribes under the control Agent, Wana, also remains unchanged, though the increase arms continues small, but regular. The small increase is undoubtedly due to the high prices which have been maintained owing to the blockade of the Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf. The Sherani figures shown in last year’s statement have been revised with the result that the fighting strength has been reduced to 2,000 and the number of breech-loading rifles is now estimated at 169. The tribe is showing an anxiety to obtain these rifles in place of the old muzzle-loaders, which accounts also for the decrease in this type of weapon. The Mianis have now been included in the statement, as this tribe, like the majority of the Bhitannis, resides in Independent territory during the hot weather.( 2 ) Price. ( 1911. 1912.

(vii) ... ... 3 8 0 4 0 0 in the market prices of the long Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield and the Martmi-Metford and Martini-Henry of European make imported through the Gulf is the salient feature of this year’s returns. Very few losses of rifles occurred amongst troops during the past year, and this has no doubt accounted for the advance in value of these highly prized weapons. The stoppage of the Gulf trade has, of course, increased the price of the European rifles imported by this route. Erom the Kurram it is reported that the pi ices of rifles, which usually rule about 10 per cent, or 20 per cent, below those of the Khyber, have been inflated to the Khyber standard for the time being owing to the recent events in Afghanistan. Amongst the Orakzais there is a growing preference for small bore rifles instead of Martini-Henry rifles of trans-border make, though the breech action is almost invariably of the Martini pattern, and this preference is reflected in an advance in price for this description of weapon. On the other hand the Khyber Afridis have favoured Martini-Henry rifles—both Arsenal and Pass made—during the past year owing to the difficulty of obtaining foreign small bore cartridges, and the demand for these rifles has increased their price amongst these tribes. The general tendency, of course, is for those tribes which are more favourably situated as regards the arms trade to sell their obsolete weapons to other tribes at a distance, and then to rearm themselves with superior weapons, and this must be taken into account in estimating the trend of supply and demand and its effect upon prices. As regards ammunition, there is an all-round advance in prices, except in the case of the solid drawn cartridges for Martini Henry-rifles and Military ammunition for Sniders. The rise in the price of small bore ammunition, apart from the difficulty in obtaining it, is explainable by the increased number of these weapons now in the hands of the tribesmen. Snider ammunition is also becoming scarcer, and this is making these weapons still more unpopular than they are at present. It must be noted that both among the Kurram and Tochi tribes the events in Khost had the effect locally of greatly reducing the price of ammunition owing to the , action of the Afghan authorities in distributing cartridges free or at a, nominal price to all who promised assistance. Martini- Henry and Snider cartridges were actually offered amongst the Wazirs and Daurs at something less than 2 annas a round. This condition of the market, however, was entirely abnormal and of only a temporary character. Effect of Operations for the Suppression of the Arms Trade. The Gulf blockade has caused a further appreciable rise in the price of European rifles imported from this direction, and has had an indirect effect in making the better classes of weapons generally more expensive to the tribesmen, though not to a very marked extent. Some small consignments reached Kabul early in the summer of 1911, but these were quite insufficient to furnish stocks to the traders, who had collected there in anticipation of a more plentifulmmmm i t J 1 ( 3 ) supply. The Political Agent, Khyber, reports that the difficulty oF getting ammunition for the rifles imported from the Gulf and the increasing output of locally made weapons have lessened the demand for the former. One very obvious result of the preventive measures has been a considerable extension of the trade in arms manufactured across the border. Both Tirah and Kohat Pass manufacturers have been busy during the year, and have found a ready market for their wares even among the more distant tribes south of the Kurram river. These rifles do not wear well, but they are effective weapons up to 800 or 3,000 yards, and their quality is remarkable considering the fact that they are entirely hand made. Pighting Strengths and Armaments. JBlack Mountain tribes.— variations from last year’s figures are normal and do not call for much remark except in the case of the Swatis of the Hazara border. The Deputy Commissioner noted last year that their fighting strengths (18,000) might have been underestimated, and this appears to have been the case. The number is now given at 22,000. The most important variation is in the Chagharzai armament. It is probable that every one of the 9,300 fighting men possesses a firearm, but these are mostly unrifled weapons which are not included in the statistics. ^ It was certainly'an error last year to show the tribe as owning 2,500 Martini-Henry rifles and the 3,000 “ unclassed ” rifles were mostly smooth-bores, and should have been omitted. It is, however, extremely difficult to get reliable informa tion about the Chagharzais. Tribes of Malakand Agency. —The figures indicate a general increase both in the fighting strength of the tribes and their armament. There are, however marked discrepancies between the results of the enquiries during the present year and those reported last year. The Political Agent who has lately 1 assumed charge of the Agency is unable to claim a high degree of accuracy tor the figures, especially as regards those tribes to which the Native Assistants have not personal access, but is introducing a system of reports which should effect an improvement in this respect. Peshawar tribes. —In comparing the statement with that for last year it is noticeable that, although the total number of arms has decreased con siderably, there is a great increase in the figures for goo 1 modern weapons. Practically all the muzzle-loading rifles shown in last year’s list have been sold, probably to people, such as the Black Mountain tribes, &amp;c., who are badly situated as regards the general direction of the arms trade. The rifles under the heading “ not classed ” are principally excellent weapons of foreign manufacture. Amongst the Mohmands and Hasan Khel Afridis the tendency , has lately been to sell all obsolete weapons for what they will fetch and to buy as many Lee-Enfield and Lee-Metford rifles as possible. The most noticeable increases are in the case of (1) the Musa Khei Mohmands, who have doubled the number of their modern rifles; (2) the Isa Khel and Burhan Khel Mohmands, whose recent feud accounts for their large purchases ; the Hasan Khel and Ashu Khel Afridis, who have bought large numbers of small bore weapons of late. Khyber tribes. —No appreciable change has to be noted in the fighting m^ths of the various clans, with the exception of the Lnargai Shinwans, whom an exact tally was taken this year, with the result that their numbers pp found to have increased by some 30 men. Most of the “ Bandari ” rifles which come into the possession of the tribesmen are sold to tribes outside the Agency, such as the Mohmands and Bunerwals.( 4 ) Generally speaking, the Afridis and other clans in the Agency are well armed, but it is to be noted that the quality of their weapons is gradually deteriorating owing to the length of time during which they have been in use, and to want of proper care. A large number of condemned weapons, princi pally Martinis, were imported from the Gulf before the blockade was enforced. These naturally have not improved by keeping. Kohot tribes —As regards the Adam Khel Afridis, the fighting strength of the Pass Afridis has fallen, but their armament has been strengthened by the substitution of small bore rifles for those of the Martini-Henry pattern. There is a striking increase both in the fighting strength and armament among the Jowakis, and the returns go to show that the manufacture of rifles in the Kohat i ass is brisker than ever. It is, however, on the Miranzai border that the armament of the tribes has received the greatest numerical accession of strength. The figures show a remarkable increase in the number of breech-loading rifles, viz. 12,187 as against 8,908 in 1911, or, roughly, an increase of 33 per cent. Although the actual numbers of *303 rifles have risen, it is perhaps doubtful whether, in view of their being country made, they represent any great increase in powers of offence. JVaziristan tribes .—Last year owing to the census special efforts were made to gauge as accurately as possible the numbers of each tribe in the Tochi jurisdiction, and the figures showing the fighting strengths of the tribes in this Agency have been left as they were for 1910-11. The armament of the Mohmit Khel, Manzar Khel and Haurs has some what increased. In September 1911 the Mohmit Khel and Manzar Khel started a clan blood feud of unusual importance, and consequently both tribes have been purchasing rifles to the extent of their respective means. A sudden and active revival of the ancient ill-feeling between the two factions of Malli- zad and Tappizad into which the Daurs are divided explains the increase in the case of this people. The small increase in the case of the Mahsuds calls for no remark. The Sherani, Bhitanni and Usterana figures must be accepted with caution, the two latter remaining the same as last year.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002cb_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2176</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002cb</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2176</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 7/7 'North West Frontier: fighting strengths and armament returns; prices of European rifles in tribal territory'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1912/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-09-27T22:51:26</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (341 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 341; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
