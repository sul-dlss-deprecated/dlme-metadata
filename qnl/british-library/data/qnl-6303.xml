Its particalar tenets, however, seem on..y to differ from those of the Sen; as i in re ;pect of the Litar^y (Wirds) whi h they asc, the aim to retarn to the parity of the faith in it; rrimitive days being; common to both. Yoa will observe that Ibn Ra ihid is the lador t whom the Tarks °;avc their .art-ort ,apying; him £ 150 a el nth. ON the o other hand Ibn Saad relies considerably on the Sheikh of ^oweit (who apparently finds him asefal as a coanter-balance in hi^ part f the world to the power of Ibn Ra hid) and as the Sheikh of A owcit is considered to be a protege of ^io Majesty 1 * GoverH -rnent , so there is a kind of idea that Ibn Saad also enjoys their ctantcnance.

N, Husain f s despatch No 4 of February? 7th 1907, I have the honour tc trnasmit herewith an abridged translation of a manuscript pamphlet lately jent to Dr S.M. Hus -ain by its auth. r Suleiman Bes am, a prominent merchant rc*idi ins; in Mecca ,a native of Ancyza in Nojd , a sirens; partisan of Ibn Rashid and opponent of the Wahabi party or party of Ibn Sad The author as ummes that his readers already know the general course of recent events in ^cjd , and therefore hi j statements arc incomplete and his chronology somewhat va^ue. The following as I understand from local Jeddah informaton ha; been the course of events:-- Abdul Aziz ibn Mutab ibn Rashid was killed in battle a- -e;aint Ibn Saud in 1324 (1906), and was succeeded by h son Me tab ibn Abdul Aziz , a=;cd 18 , who reigned 9 months and was then killed in January 1907 by his maternal uncle Sultan , as reported by Dr S.M,Husain in the despatch above reffered • Sul- -tan reigned till April 1908 when he was killed by his brother Saud who in August 1908 wa ; overthrown and hortly afterwards killed , hi 3 (Saudis) place as Amir be ins; taken by Saud ibn Ab- -dul Aziz the rrc ;cnt Amir as;cd 10, brother of the previous Ami Mutab ^bn Aziz*— not by the amc mother, as Dr S. M. Husain erron -cou ly states, but by a lady of the Subhan family ,members of which family arc now his guardians, I have etc, J.H. MONAHAN. H, B. M f s Consul at Jeddah, Translation, In the year 1205 Kijri (1792) arose the Amiratc of Saud under a show of religious policy , but real y serving worldly ends. Now sheikh Mahomed ibn Abdul Wahhab , the famous fcinder of the Wahabi sect , was working with °aud ibn Abdul Aziz the first Amir of the Saud line, and he gave out fctwas enjoining obedience to Saud and he named him Imam of the Moslems and .aid that eh who rose against him had no religion, and he who oppos- «cd him was an infidel. For twncty years the apostles of this faith spread it by the sword until finally Mecca and A,i edina were taken , and the Syrian Haj Caravan was driven back in ac- -cordancc with a Fctwa from Abdul Wahhab, Now the mother of the Sultan of the Osmanlis was in this caravan , and the Sultan was angry and the Egyptian cxrcditions ordered byt he Sutlan followed by which Arabia was conquered , but no soldiers nor Government authorities were imposed on Ncjd , which land was If left in its Arab Bedowy state and 22 years later the Saud fami- -ly began to raise its previous pretension , Imam Faisal Saud bringing men to the religi n bu the power of the sword and de~ -nouncing as infidel: al who opposed him. The Government took IBJbdfc to k alram and Rushed Pasha was sent from E°;ypt in 1253 (1837) and Faisal was taken prisoner, and afterwards there was confxis- -ion and discord in the family and destruction foil on it ; and meanwhile the Amirate of the hos e- of Ibn Rashid was independefi and the house of sA-^d had no authority over itbst rather padil it respect and courted it , and offerred it yearly presents o'st of the Ncjd revenues, and so the relations be two * n the two houses were friendly in the time of Faisal and the frontier was in (?) Kasim , and the North was ■sndor the sway of the house of Rashid and the South under the sway of the house of Ibn saud • In 1290 )1873) the famous Mahomed ibn Abdullah ibn Rashid succeeded to the Amirate and he ruled with =;o d policy without and within, and his sway increased daily , and the ho us of Saud declined , and the former obtained full authority over all Ncjd , which from 1301 to 1315 (1383 to 1897 ) was undis puted and the land flourishing in hapxiness and security, and he died and his brother’s son Abdul Aziz ibn Mutab-al-Rashid held the Amiratc until*1319 (1903) ((Note:-* ^e held the Amir- (-atc 4 or 5 years longer until Mut’ab ibn Abdul azIz acceded in (1324 (sec below) , but the author means that during those last ( 4 or 5 years he fell away from the =;o d courses he had previou ^-ly followed)), and he walked in the fo tsteps of hi j uncle , and the rcoplc were in the greatest comfort and security , only Abdul Axix was a stubborn man of independent judgement who woul not take advice and this injured his position in home and for- -ei^n affairs , and his determination and courage were of no avail, and his adherents fell away from him as he would not con -suit them and made little of them. Renunciation of the Amiratcsaud.:.-— Mubarak-as-Subah Sheikh of Koweit killed his two brothers Mahomed and Jcrrah in 2 #!! -Kadah 1313 (1895), and the sons of the two killed ones to k refuse with their maternal uncle Yusuf Ibrahim famed ftr his wealth and hi&gt; generous pro- -tcction of suppliants, and those sons had recourse also to the Ottoman Government in the Valiyat of Basrah in the time of Vali Hamdi Pasha and Mubarak became afrxid from what he knew of Yu- -fuf and of the ri^ht of the Ottoman Government to interfere, but these matters nc*.d not be detailed as th^.y are genera~ly known . And to protect himself Mubarak thought of get,tin?; the Amirs of the house of Saud and the people of Rasim who dwelt in the neighbourho d of Koweit to be stumbling -blocks as in tfe the way of Ibn Ra hid , for he knew the latter to be an agent of the Ottoman Government , and feared th.. Government might in- -cite him to conquer Koweit from the land idc , and in fact Ibn Rashid did submit this idea to the Palace at Yildiz more than once , but the Government did not at prove of it, as the Government was under the inf. uence of intriguers employed by Mubarak ,who for money considerations opposed the policy of pr* -tccting the sons of the two slain Princes and their maternal uncle Yusuf bin Ibrahim ,so that he , Yusuf bin Ibrahim excused him.clf and withdrew to India : and when the Ottoman Governmen heard of the departure of Yusuf bin Ibrahim , it suggested toto I bn Raahid to ^cnd for him to Hail and the Government set abo'st making peace bet T v^en Mubarak and the sons of hie: brothers and I bn Ra;;hid obeyed and -ient for Yusuf bin Ibrahim, and '•vhen the latter went to H^il Mubarak took alarm and tried to -end on a raid Into the desert against Ibn Rashid the Amirs of ^hc house of Ibn Saud and of Kasim who were near him % but they re- -fused a: they knew they were too weak , and he put compulsion on them and toplcase him they went out and for ix years they assailed the Amiratc of Ibn Rashid , and the men of the -Palace turned against Ibn Rashid owins; the golden arguments used by Mubarakm and only the Sultan himself remained favourable to him in spite of the calumniators who tried to turn him against him for he knew the truth about the Amirates of Ibn Gaud and Ibn Rashid , that the former wanted the kingdom and the khalifatc and the latter the Amirate under the shadow of the Ottoman Ores -cent; but the intriguers prevented the Sultan from helping Ibn Rashid and from noticing the misdeeds of Ibn Saud ,and this was due to the preponderance of the party of Abdul Huda (May God requite every traitor to his Government and hi j country with what he desrves) *. So th the present day Mubarak-as-Subah , Sheikh of howeit , is the main force for the support of the Ami -ate of Ibn Saud , only in the last years he is making a show of coquetting with Ibn Rashid, but in reality he is helping Ibn Saud with money and men and arms and ammunition • Also there has been internal discord in the Amiratc of Ibn Rashid and men of the house h ve murdered one another, and those matters are well known and need not be detailed hv.ro, Zamira, to o f Mut^a b ibn A b dul A z iz ibn R ashid 1 324 (190- He as umed the Amiratc with the help of the tribe Sham- -ar at the age of 18, and his maternal uncles (the son) of Hamu Ibn Ubaid) Sultan and Saud and Faisal were envious of the young -cr man getting the Amirate and they combined to slay the Amir Muta f ab and his brothers and hi; cousins on hi father f s side and they succeeded in their plot (I mean these were killed Mut f ab and hi brother: and the son of his paternal uncle).. During his Arairatc of nine months Sultan and hi brothers had full control of the affairs of the Amiratc , but this did not suffice without the title. Now Sultan assumed the Amirate (Jan 1907), and envy and hatred sprang up among the three brothers, so that Sultan was obliged to a proach the Subhans, who had bee the VAzirs of the Amirate before Mut f 4b , and who are he matcr- -nal uncles of the present Amir ibn bdui .ziz ibn Rashid a boy of 10 years who was living with them. God, through the Subhans protected the child from the plot of the sons of Haraud , and whne the discord between the sons of Hamud became more sharp , the Subhans were afraid fdfr the boy , and the chief of them Ham -ud as subhan feigning il ness went away with the bey, taking his own valuables with him, to Medina where they to k up their abode. The Sultan and his just mini tqr thankdd Hamud as Sub- -han and gave him and the boy a sufficient a -lowancc , (May God exalt the ottoman Government and give it glorious victory).ri Killin g cf Sulta/ii ibn H^nr ad ibn Qb eid i bn Rg dhid^ Rabi- al- -Awal 1326 (Ap ril 1908): — S'altan having as umed the Amiratc bent hid brother Faisal aa Governor of in the extreme norh of Ncjd , and kept with him as hib Vizier his brother 8a-d. Bad feeling arose between the two ( the Amir and his brother the V± V izier ). Finally Sand killed his brother the Amir (God save ns from sn#h doings). Now Abdnl ‘ ziz ibn Abdnl Raharaan of the honse of Ibn Sand sccino; the discord in the hr n *e of Ibn Rashid 9 wished to rpofit by it and be=;an an open corrc pondence %ith the Amir Snr.tan and and the same time a secret one with the Amir 1 s enemies • He corresponded with Bedonins and settled Ark Arabs within Nejd and with the Ottoman Government and Amirs on the Persian Gnlf ontsidc , and Enropean observers thon^ht he wonld obtain withont itfai/VtftXi*/ re istancc control over all Nejd bnt he knew this ccnld n t be done iithont the help o the Amir (that is the Amir for the time bcin£ of the honse of Ibn RaslitjL and She ikhs of the Shammar , as , nntil 40 years a^o these Amir were aiway; in the position of independent al. ios and helpers of the Ibn S«nds, recognising their authority cap cial y in the sonthern ,western!?) and eastern parts :f Nejd » and ^ettin^ from Riadh yearly snbsidies , and fu.l authority over the north and westward as far as ^edina and eastward as far as Samawah and Al Hnsain and Meshed. Therefore this Ibn Sand approached the chiefs of shammar and stirred np the strife in the family of Ibn Rashid , b t it was of no avail for most of the chiefs ctf Sharamar rememebored Mahomed ibn Rashid famon for his jnstic and ^ood policy: and all the chiefs swore on the Koran fidelity to the honse of Ibn Rashid. Now at this time Hamnd as-Sabhan and his brothers and sonsins were at Medina and iith them the boy. seernd son of Abdnl Aziz ibn Ra hid , their nephew on the mother f s side. And those cheifs who swore fidelity to the honse of Ibn Rashid had sworn at the same time to pnrify the Amiratc from the rule of the house of Obcid , that is from the rnle of Snltan Sand and Faisal. They wished the boy to govern nnder the tutelage of the Snbhans who had from the old times always been vizier j of the Ibn Ra hids and are of the best blood of Shammar closely al icd by marriage with the Ibn Rashid j and arc men of weight and wealth and thon^h forming one family with the Ibn Rashid^ Amirs , still having each separte property , where -as^the Amir posses e nothing nt what he amasses before his accession . bnt what he collects when Amir i i cal ed Bait al Ml Mai and no one may s end it not even thu Amir himself . the Ocn Conncil having fnll power of the pnrse. Details of the revonne of Nejd here follow:- Taxes (1) on each camel i Maria Theresa dollar - about 5%d .(Nnmbers of camel' nnder 10 exempt . i Otto -man Lira on each 40 sheep (nnmbers of sheep nndor 40 exempt), &amp; per cent on prodnee of crops and palms). The resistance of Bedonins to the above taxes on animals sometimes provokes the Amir to end expeditions against them of which the results vary When the expedition is sncce . sfnl the Bedenin. pay the expenses of it.After Sultan al Maraud had ‘bc.^n Amir for one year he and hit* brothers formed the plan of dividing araon^ themselves the lar-;c of the sharamar chiefs who went an urgent raes a^c to Haraod as- Subhan In Medina to come arad wave shamraar from the traitor , and he responded to their cal and went with thrara and the re sult is known* Accessio n of S aud ibn Alxiul Aziz ibn Ra shid- Re ja b 1326 (Au 1 August 1908). He was acclaimed by all the chiefs . Hiw age was 11 * His guardian was (as ha been stated ) H^raud as Sub- -han his maternal uncle « For three months the latter worked at the internal affairs of Nejd * and brought them back to the goed state of the time of Mahomed ibn Abdur riawid. and then he turned to external politics . He won over the neighbouring Arabs by their go d opinion of him* and the more distatt ones by force of arms* and no Arabs of Nejd remained on the wide of Ibn Saud except some of the tribe of Muteyr and of the men of Kasim and Woshm and Sadeyr and Mahmal; and dcarhh is chron- -io among al those above-named* and those people are helpless from the barrcncss of the soil and the dearness of provisions, whereas the territories of Ibn Rashid arc all fertile « Mo most of Nejd is inclined to Ibn Rashid from i.-l-feeling against Ibn Maud and from a belief that the omens are against him. The com -plcte downfall of Ibn Maud would seem near * only that ^ubarak as-Mabah sheieh of ffoweit has renewed hi i assistance so that perhaps with continual str ggling the rule of Ibn Maud may be maintained for a year or two* It now looks a if Mubarak is drawing back and docs not care which of the two parties prevail as he is openly clinging to the skirts of the Ottoman Gov^rnm- -raent and secretly to the English . It is probable that the Ot -toman Government has de igns of subsidising and concialiating Ibn Maud thinking that he can settle the affirs of Nejd * wher- -eas he has really'no power to settle or rtri up anything* but the Government is misled by its ignorance and by intriguers * tho gh it will so&lt;n find again the right path--that of friend ship with the Ibn Rashids • As we have aid Ibn Rashid * unlike Ibn Maud is loyal to the Multan and in his territory pcaycr arc offered for the Multan every Friday* Lately Hamud as Subhan guardian of the yo;*ng Amir died • his death is no way ahhok the Amirato * as there are 25 men of the Mubhans of h ra each ii capable to take his place and the young Amir will always have goes counsellors and when he ha j grown up wi .1 have learnt the value of good counsel; and the Ottoman Government helps them by its new constitution * and no doubt that constitutional programme will under the auspices of the ottoman Government be introduced into Nejd* AMIRa te of Maud ib n Abdul A ziz ibn Rashid(August 1908 ) The Ottoman Government accepted and confirmed the accession a &gt;d assigned him and hi s maternal uncles the Subhans sufficiet allowances and gave them rank and decorations and gave Maud ih j Abdul Aziz the title of 'Amir of Nejd” and gave instructions | accordingly to all the walis of the Turk! h Arabian Provinces treasure of tho Bait al Mai ; and this increased the irritatinthose of Baghdad, Basra, Aleppo, Damascus, and Hejaz and to the Mutassarif -j such a of Medina, Hassa and Ncjd* The favour of the Ottoman G-overnment towards the house of Ibn Rashid ij v/ell- -known to all Arabs • Ibn Rashid is ^lad to receive firmans of investiture from the Ottoman Government under whose feet he places his checks as a.-l the x bn Rashids have done ever since the first coming of the Egyptians into Arabia* Shammar Karb Mutayr Tribes and Towns in Nejd* • •«••••»•• *40, 000 ~~ 20,000 20 , 000 - Al 10,000 Anaza Araibdar U t &gt;ay ba Kahtah .

With reference to my despatches Nos 17 of 9th April last and No 23 of 15th inst , I have the honour to report that I have received the following from the auth r of the pamphlet of which a translation was enclosed in the second despatch re- -forced to above M During the pa t four months Ibn Rashid has been chastising the Bedcuins of Ncjd , who had risen against him and three or four encounters have taken place and the ^edouins and settled Arabs also have be.n filled with dread • But Ibn Saud .whose territory is bar en and who is badly provided wihh riding ani- -mals and sheep and cattle cannot cvhow such activity as Ibn Rashid . On the 21 ;t May (new European ^:tyle) mon of the Utey- -ba and Harb tribes came to Mecca and agreed in hhc ir in forma- -tion that Ibn baud came rut from hi 1 territory in hostile ar- -ray against some Bedouins belonging to the Harb and Shammar tribes and subject t Ibn Rashid , and took part if' their cn- -campments but could not take their animals .

In the result 200 men of Ibn baud f s side were killed and 40 of Ibn Ra hid f s and a large number &lt;f camels and horse were taken by Ibn Ra hid.and Ibn SaTid witfe the remainder of hi men took ref'S.^e in Aneya Aneyza, and Ibn Rashid tcturned to hii own country* Ibn Sa^d 1 8 caxiac is ccntinxia-.ly failing in Ncjd * and the people arc in- -clinin^ toward* Ibn Raahid and it is expected that by the end of this year the latter will be master of all Ncjd • as to the acdoTiins of the ffejaz they arc bein'* bro^ht to tranquillity by the wise mea uros of the Grand shcrif.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No 13 of the 15th inst , enclosing a pamphlet on w cjd affair r, I have the honour to submit the followin'* observations on Wahabism. Wahabism seems to be dying out in the Hejaz , though a few small Bedouin sub-tribes still profess it • Sencussism ,of which there is an of icial representative in Mcc*a is the most active religious force among the Hejaz Bedouins and especially in the great Harb tribe* In the towns , cc a .Medina , Jed dah, and Yambo, there are no avowed Wahabi , the populations having a certain horror of the sect and regarding them as hypo crites , but there arc in Mecca and Jeddah many known to be Ion to the sect and distinguished for their abstinence from tobacco and gencrtl Puritanism , I have not been able to obtain figure , but understand that seme hundreeds in Mec a and a score or two in Jeddah are kni nn as Wahabis * Among them in each of the two towns are two or three families of Indians(Delhi). A membe of one i the Chief Clerk of this consulate. These Indian Waha -bis seem eminent among Wahabis for sanctimonious gravity and for dislike of western civilization . Though they have a strong leaven of hypocrisy , their morality eems real y excellent , but their mind seems particularly thick with the Wahabi rust o of which Doughty so often speaks. They feel , I imagine ,ccr» -tainly no sentimental loyalty toward] British rule. Of Wahabism in Ncjd I have little information beyond what ii given in thi ; partisan pamhplet , but I gather that the parr;-/“N ‘V &gt; f pamphlet ia correct in repreiontin?; it aa hopeleaaly decayed eac -cept in the comparatively amall part nndcr the immediate con- -trcl of Ibn is^nd.

It would seem from Captain Shakespear’s letter that Sulaiman Bassam’s pamphlet gives a tolerably accurate representation of the state of affairs in Central Arabia, if allowance is made for his bias in favour of the Ibn Bashid f action. No. C.-l, dated Kuwait, the 4th January 1910 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The First Assistant Resident, in charge Residency, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence regarding affairs in Nejd forwarded under your endorsement No. 2996, dated the November 1909. 2. The correspondence was particularly interesting as giving a more detailed and frank exposition of the position of affairs and politics in Central Arabia than is generally obtainable from local enquiries, and as this description was from a point of view distinctly partial to the Ibn Rashid faction I have been at some pains to test the information from available sources in Kuwait, which may be assumed as equally partial to the Wahabi chief. 3. In discussing with Shaikh Mubarak the present position and influence of the two leaders, I gathered that the prestige of Bin Sand has undoubtedly suffered from the bad seasons his territories have experienced and the conse quent weakness of his camels and mares and the high prices of food-stuffs, whilst the Shammar Chief has by comparison a full treasury, his people have had good crops and their riding cattle are in good condition. As the Shaikh expressed it “ the power of the Arab is in his camels and mares.” Shaikh Mubarak would not admit that there had been defections from Bin Saud of any large numbers of the tribes he formerly counted as his adherents and asserted that as far as available men went Bin Saud was the more powerful though he had not the sinews of war in money, provisions and animals. This view, however, was not confirmed by a well-informed Arab merchant, who admitted that there had really been large defections from Bin Saud and, as he naively said, the Bedouin will cleave to him who appears the stronger at the moment. It is worthy of note that both the Wahabi leader and Ibn Rashid have not indulged in any serious expeditions for some months, each remaining at his capital ; the reasons ascribed for this truce are the weakness of the former combined with the respect of the latter for the considerable opposition he would certainly encounter in any attempt on Bin Saud’s villages and populated tracts. It may be taken as a fact, therefore, that the two Powers in Central Arabia are more or less in equilibrium. It is undoubtedly Shaikh Mubarak’s policy to maintain this equilibrium, and I have been told more than once that all Shaikh Mubarak’s dealings with the Bedouin tribes have for their ultimate object this balance, together with his own aggrandizement, whereby his support becomes and remains the most desired end of each of the rival chiefs. 4. On the whole, I am inclined to think that if a considerable allowance is made for the partiality displayed in Sulaiman Bassam’s pamphlet, he gives a tolerably accurate presentiment of Central Arabian affairs and politics.A,^Kt^ractB from Diar^ No.4 of x,he Koweit Political A Agency for the week ending 26th January 1910. 22nd Januar^ • A messenger from Bin Rashid arriv- -ed to-da^ bringing a report to Bheikh Mobarak of a raid committed b u Bin Rashid on the Harb (Bani Abdilla) tribe and of large looting from them. xxx xraets from Liar^ No,5 of i,he Koweit Poli-uical - Agency for the week ending 2nd February 1910. 27th January, x x x A messenger arrived from Abdul Aziz bin Baud bringing a reporu to Sheikh Mobarak to the effect that Abdul Aziz bin Saud had destroyed the fort of Harij and had imprisoned the Sheikh of the place. Two of the grand nephews of Abdul Aziz bin Saud came to him and told him that the Sheikh he had imprisoned was their maternal uncle and entreated him for his release but Abdul Aziz refused. The messenger also reported that Abdul Aziz bin Saud had raided the Ajman and taken from them a heav u toll in loot. On learning of this 5 of the Awlad-i-lbn Saud came uo Abdul Aziz and asked him for the restitution of the looted camels etc, as the w belonged to their uncle and that for their sake he should return the looted pro- -pert^ . It is said Abdul Aziz got annoyed and refused to accede to their requests telling them that he was 'Hakim' (sic) of Nejd and there- -fore he would do what he pleased, whilst the., (Awlad-i-Ibn Saud) should not interfere in such matters. It is said that in consequence of this repl^ the nine ^oung men (two of whom are the grand nephews of Abdul Aziz and the 5 Awlad-iten Saud referred to above) have left their homes and gone to a place called Furgaija, about hour’s distance from Til Hassa.

Sheikh Mobarak au Us Summan or Dahana about, 4 hours distance from As Safa. It is not probable uhat a meeting will actually take place, but Sheikh Mobarak is more likely to be making as- tmte use of the opportunity of Bin Baud’s rather impoverished condition in order to force resti - * -tution of the Koweit camels from the Ajman without himself having to send a force to compel them, so that if an*body’s fingers should be burnt in the process the^ will not be Koweit fingers.iiiiiiflin-fliiiir *i Extracts from Liar^ No*6 of 'Lhe Koweit Political Agenc^ for *uhe vreek ending 9th February 1910• X/ Vn 4?* ord.

Report reached Koweit to-day of the defeat of the Bin Subah and Bin Baud fighting forces by Sheikh Sa'adun of the Muntafich on the 16th March between Ar Rakhaimiya, TTaguba and Zaraibiat. It appears that on that date the com bined force early 0 in the morning attacked first and defeated the Muntafich who retired without an 0 great loss. Shortly afterwards. Sheikh Sa’adun delivered a vigorous counterattack from a flank against the right wing composed of Koweit Araibdars and Umtair Bedouins and apparently the Koweit men made no attempt at a stand. Sheikh Jabir and his followers fleeing almost at once, leaving the Bin Subah war-flag and half their ,, thaluls ,, in the hands of the enent. Meanwhile Bin Saud and his brothers supported b„ the Ah Ajman on the left wing were engaged with others of Sheikh Sa’adur force and appear to have made gallant efforts to save the da.,. In retreating which the., seem to have carried out methodically the., made thiee stands but owing to the flight of the Koweit men were powerless to turn a defeat into vieto it • In the first successful attack, the Ajman secuied about 50 horses from the Thaffir who directly opposed them. The disaster is said to have been due partly to the surprise and xlgExans vigour of Sa’adun’s force being far larger than was anti cipated especially in horsemen. The report goes that Sa'adun besides his Muntafich Bedouin had with him 500 horsemen of the Shammer, nearly all the Thaffir sections and the *Lbadur,Ziad,’Smait, As Safa, .El Majarid, Bani Malich,As Shraifat,Bani Husseini, Ar Rafaiah, A1 Fauhool, A1 Kha^a’al, Bani Hawaichim, Bani Lami, Bani Khagan, Bani f Said and ouhers. Trie force under his command contained nearly 4000 horsemen, a large number of dismount- -ed men and no bhaluls, ■whilst/ hhe Bin Sub ah and Bin Saud combined force was largely composed of uhalul-riders wi'uh onl^ about/ 1000 horsemen. It/ is said if Bin Saud had nou been present/ uhe Bin Subah forces would have been compleuelj dest/.ro^ed. Onl^ a few casualt/ies so far are re ported on the Bin Subah side, none of the bigger Sheikhs having been killed. It is said Sheikh Sa*adun ordered that/ none of t/he enent should be put to death, that/ onl- their arms should be taken and the men allowed to go unmolested. The force is returning to Jahara and awaits Sheikh Mob a rak* s orders, though it is considered certain fresh efforts will be made at once and a second attempt launched at Sa’adun as soon as re-inforcements have been collected. The above report was given to the Political /.gent by a small Ajman Sheikh who was present in the fightHC. yzt of .1910 • iiritiBh liasidancy and Oonaulate-uonoral, dUBiiirB, 20 tn karcii 1910* 3 trom *ia jor i • Trevor p I • /. •, i'lrst ABsiat&amp;nt iieaident In oharge of Kealdenoy* To The xion^l© iir. outlor, O.I.ii.,, Secretary to the uovemment of India In the Foreign Department, CALCUTTA. p v Sir, in continuation of my talo^am Ho. 245 dated 15th inatant, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the uovrrn- mont of India, a copy of the marginally cited letter from the Letter So.

You will see that the Government of India direct that a warning should he conveyed to the Shaikh in terms of the previous warning, not to enter into any operations calculated to involve him in difficulties in Nejd or with the Turks. The previous warning to which the Government of India refer was conveyed to Shaikh Mubarak personally by Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball, C.I.E., the then Resident, in October 1901, when the Shaikh was contemplat ing an expedition in force against Ibn Rashid. The former warning was dis regarded by the Shaikh. 3. On that occasion Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball was instructed “ to visit Kuwait and ascertain the state of affairs regarding tension between the Amir of Nejd and Mubarak and counsel the Shaikh to avoid by all means in his power any display of activity which might afford Turkey excuse for greater interference in Kuwait affairs.** 4. I would suggest that at an interview with Shaikh Mubarak you should make an opportunity of referring to the recent expedition and warn the Shaikh against engaging in any expedition which is calculated to bring him into collision with the Turks. Shaikh Mubarak will, no doubt, insist that the ex pedition is against the Muntafik and agreeable to the lurks, but it will be as well to let him understand that a policy of adventure in the interior does _ not commend itself to Government. Perhaps the Resident who is due on Friday next may take an opportunity of visiting the Shaikh, but it seems advisable to deliver the warning at once.Ext*ract, from Diarj No, 115 of t/he Koweit/ Polit/ical Agen.c„ for the week ending 30th March 1910, 24th March, Bin Baud with his brother, Sa’ad , arrived in Eoweit from Jahara via Sirra w esterda^ and returned to Sirra Si to Sheikh Mobarak’s camp to-dat • It is reported that Sheikh Mo^Cbarak has made fresh demands from all Koweit people. Those who had given one 'khabra' (a tent with 7 men and 5 camels) for the first raid have now been asked to give 7 camels and 10 men. Even the lowest class of people have had to contribute. It is said that for the first raid the prostitutes were required to give coffee pots each one from 1 to 3 pots accord ing to her means. This time, it is said, the,, have been asked to give bedding. Merchants who owe mone., to the Sheikh for dates and loans taken from him have been pressed for immediate payments b but some are unable to comply having onlj goods and no read^ cash. All carpenters have been com mandeered b^ the Sheikh’s men to make camel saddles etc. There is great scarcity of camel equipments in the local market as what was avail able had been already bought up for the first raid. Camels and firearms are plentiful but their prices have almost doubled and the Bedouins are reaping a golden harvest over the former. It is reported that Sheikh Mobarak has ordered men from Fao and Dora to come and join him for the forthcoming raid. The latest rumour sa w s 2 war-flags were looted from Bin Subah’s forces the Muntafich and that one (which was a Bin Baud flag) has been sent to Ibn Rashid to inform him of the defeat ofr~—m- 1 of the combined forces and the other has been re tained b.. Sheikh Sa’adun. 29th March. Among others who were killed in the recent raid, are Abdur Rahman ibn Hallaf of the Sheikhs of Us Said of the Thaffir section and Lahil ibn Mundil of the Bani Khalid. Thamir ibn Sa 1 adun it is said was wounded. It is reported that Bin Rashid has reached A1 Halaiba a da., west of Hafar, his objective being the Umtair.

In the skirmish which took place between them the S'bia and Usfool secured a horse and a thalul belonging to Saud bin Abdul Aziz and have brought them to show to Bin Saud. 20th March.

Sir, ih© fcllo'.ving information has reached me regarding recent fighting in the direction of the Euphrates and in the Sandjak of ^ ontific. On March 19 the ’’Senajer” a sec tion of the 'Ahouda' tribe with their followers attached the town of Sh&amp;ttra at night and oillaged the bazaars. A sharp engagement ensued between the Arabs and the Turkish troops stationed there with the result that the Turks suf fered considerably, losing a Lajor, two officers and 93 soldiers killed and about 30 men wounded. On the Arab side several men were killed and some wounded. Further details about the watfeep affair have not reached Basra. The inha- bitan^ of Shatira are of the Abouda tribe which is divided into two sections o^ 1 which ’’As-Senajer' oppose the Turks and 'As-fhamkhi” support them. I understand in the recent fighting the 'As-Shamkhi' section helped the Turkish troops against their fellow townsmen. The growing enmity which arose last year between Sheikh k obarak of noweit and Sadun Pasha out of some disagreement in commercial matters, has recently culminated in open hos tilities. Bin Saoud has been visiting Koweit and accompanied by Sheikh Jaber, Lobar ah's eldest son, and a large number of Arabs proceeded a short time ago to a place in the desert, of which I have nt»t yet learnt the name, about three days march North West of Zobeir. They were met there by Sadun a&amp;d his followers and severe fighting is said to have occurred, in which Bin Saoud and Jaber suffered considerable loss in camels, horses and rifles captured by the enemy. There does not seem to have been much loss of life on either side. Pin Saoud and Jaber fled from the field a'°ter the defeat and were pursued by a large number of Arabs from the ‘-ontific he Rt.lien.Sir G.A.Lowther, P.G.L.G. Ac • &amp;c. &amp;c.

A telegram from a Turkish officer in llontafic to his father at Basra says the route from Nasrieh to Shattra is very dangerous. I an informed that the presence of the Arabs of Sin Saoud in the neighbourhood of Katif has alarmed the Turks and that the (fommodore Hikmet Pasha, who left on board the 'Marmaris' on the 3rd instant for Katif, ostensibly for the purpose of establishingqj^uard stations between Hofuf and Ojair, 'has been despatched there to enquire the reasons for their appearance in that neighbourhood.

The allowance paid by the Turkish Government to the young Amir of Jabal Shammar,Sa 1 ud—bin— 1 Aodul Aziz,has lately oeen raised from S,T,150 to 3,1,200 a month. He has also received a Turkish decoration and the title of Amir—ul-dmara. It is believed here that dissensions have broken out in the rmling family of Southern Najd,and that these will afford the Amir of Jabal Shammar some relief in his perennial struggle against their encroachments. Letter from Mr,G.E.Leachman to Mr.J.G.Lorimer, 22nd February,1910. Dear Mr.Lorimer, I think there is a chance of getting this to Baghdad. I write from the camp of the Amir Ibn Rashid from near the Birkeh of *A1 Shahiyah on the Derb al Zobeidah to Baghdad,distant 5 days from Hayil. After I left Karbala,which I did with great difficulty,! travelled with the Shammar Bedu under Majid ibn Ajal in a south westerly direction. I left Karbala on January 26th. I was with the Shammar till February 12th. On that day we ran into a big ghazzu of Aneza on their wayway to Tight Ihn Rashid. They attached the Shammar,hut before they actually closed I and my party slipped out and crosred over to the tents of the Aneza Sheihh^Fahd Beg,who took us in. The Sharomar had every single animal and possession taken. As to past movements of these Aneza,at the time of the Bed the Rawala under Nouri fbn Sheilan seized Jauf from Ihn Rashid, killed the governor and looted the town and after moved across the Nafud,having left a garrison in Jauf. At the wells of Hayil (on map) a ghazzu of Ihn Rashid checked them temporarily, • hut they joined up with the Amarat under Fahd Beg and Dehamshir, and when I met them they were an enormous mass of men, I moved with them to Birkeh of Jumaima on Derb al Boheida,and we halted there to allow reinforcements to come up. Many of the Madan Aifahs from the Euphrates joined up,as also men of the Aneza. At this time Ihn Rashid was reported to he two days away with only a few Shammar. however on February 17th at about 5 in the afternoon,a masr of Shammar attacked the Aneza camp,which extended for several miles,and after a good fight drove right through the camp. I took refuge with some Shammar prisoners and rescued most of my kit,except a few things'. The Aneza ran very fast,pressed by the Shammar,but night stopped the Shammar,who returned and looted the camp. The next morning,out of some thousands of tents,not a stick remained. The Aneza were utterly broken and since Fahd Bej? has sent in offering peace, Apparently this movement of Aneza was concerted between them and Ibn Sa'ud of Riadh with the idea 01 utterly finishing the Rashid power, I came with the Shammar back to this place where Ibn Rashid was camped, I was received in audience next day. Sa'ud ibn Rashid is a boy of 12,who came to the Amirate 13 months ago,his brother Mutab having been killed by Sultan ibn Obeid ibn Rashid and the latter in his turn killed by Mamud ibn Sabhan,an uncle of this boy. The regent is one Samil ibn Sabhan,a man of 35. At pre- -sent the power of Rashid is not very great,but there is little doubt/ doubt* that this victory over the Aneza will bring many tribes to him. I was received most genially,and atter in private asked by Zamil my object in coming to Shammar.

Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—L ieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. C-14, dated the 30th March 1910, I have the honour to submit what is ascertainable regarding Sheikh Mubarak’s inten tions against Sheikh Sa’adnn. I have deferred reporting hitherto for the reason that no definite information could be gathered and indeed none is yet available, but my diaries will have shown what has happened from day to day. 2. So far as I can ascertain from several sources the position now is that Sheikh Mubarak does not intend to send a force against Sa’adun for some months. It is even hinted that there will be no expedition at all. He told me that it was to his interest to delay the expedition until heat becomes excessive for the reason that then most of the Muntafik will leave Sa’adun, being employed in their date-gardens, and besides as the tribes are principally horse-owners and not camel-owners they cannot move far in the hot weather for want of water. The Sheikh’s people will be mounted almost exclusively on “ thaluls ” and there fore to some extent independent of water. The Sheikh is maintaining his force practically intact in the desert though the Umtair Bedouins have been permitted to leave for raiding on their own account. 3. The Sheikh said to me that he had asked Abdul Aziz Bin Saud not to remain longer because reports had been received that his long absence from Riadh was likely to bring his family into difficulties and though Bin Saud was loth to leave without having assisted in avenging Mubarak’s defeat at Sheikh Sa’adun’s hands he had been prevailed on to return and see to his own affairs in Riadh. The Sheikh at first insisted on all preparations for the season’s pearling fleet being suspended, but eventually released the divers and nakhodas from duty in the field on the condition that their places were taken by substitutes. Though this affords some measure of relief it means a very heavy drain on the resources of this part of the community. 4. Grumbling is very general at the heavy expenditure which the expedition has already entailed on all classes and the small tradesmen and merchants, who being unable to afford substitutes, have to join the force in person, have little left ; some I have heard have even been forced to sell part of their household property to meet demands from the men they have to support. I have occasion ally, in a friendly way, tried to show the Sheikh that in keeping up an idle force for an indefinite period as he is doing at present, he is rapidly depleting the resources of his oeople. He replies that the hardship is one that does not come often and unless it is undergone occasionally in order that outside interference be suitably punished his prestige with the Bedouin would vanish, a contingency which would leave Koweit open to the raids of any large force of Bedouins and so all security would be destroyed. I have, of course, spoken to the Sheikh very cautiously in the matter without any suggestion in the way of bringing pressure to bear upon him. 5. Overtures for peace have been made by Sa’adun and the Thaffir Sheikhs, but the Sheikh assures me that they were not genuine and he could not think of accepting them without restitution of the property already lost.

Ir.Crow considered the task of resfcor- —ing order to be hopeless without liberal concessions to the tribes in the natter of outstanding revenues,counterpoised by the destfr^ch of a fresh military force to the scene. Samawah is the only place about which anything subse- —quent to the military evacuation of the Lower Euphrates country/ is known at Baghdad • and there, it is stated, swarms of Arabs armed with Martini rifles immediately entered the town to the dismay of the Qaim-Maqam,who had been left with only 6 Dhabitiyehs to wrotect his life and enforce h? s orders. The Arabs will do well not to forget,during this inter- -regnum,that sooner or later the 'Turks will certainly come back. New arrangements for the collection of the revenues of the 'funtafik Sanjaq have been announced by the Acting Mutasarrif to the tribesmen through his subordinate Oaim- 'laqams and fudirs. Th.e essence of these is that the Khums or M fifth M recoverable on grain will not be collected direct from the tribes in future,but will be taken at dumah and Hai from the merchants by whom the grain of the tribes is bought up and exported. Vessels carrying grain will be required to furnish proof,on demand,that the Khums leviable on their cargoes has been duly raid. The difficulties between the Wali of Sasrah and the Shaikh of ^uhammarah have now been ad/lusted.

Zaid al Affassi, a messenger from Bin Saud, arrived on 'Ohe 27th August wix»h news to Sheikh Mubarak that the Bani Thamim, people of Al Houtha village had come and conspired with the people of El Harij village with the inten tion of murdering the headmen in charge of Bin Baud’s fort in El Harij. To carry out their plan, it is said, 4 of the leading men from El Harij belonging to the El Khatlan tribe entered the fort during a night leaving out side their other comrades to invite tne fort authorities to come and dine with them on the following day. The ueople in the fort suspect ing some foul play at the bottom shut up the fort doors and, arresting the 4 men, cut ofi their heads and threw them out over the tort walls on their friends outside. This caused a considerable excitement when the occupmts of the fort opened fire on their enemy from the tor killing, it is said, 80 men of tne El Houtha and El Harij. 80. The messenger also reports that one Eahaid bin Ma’ammer, one of Bin Baud's men, with 100 followers, has raided on the El Houtha village and has taken from i.hem dOO camels and property. It is said that in the skirmish which ensued in the course of the loot, 2 men were killed of the El Houtha village. 81.

Nothing have been published in the newspapers of the circum stances or occasion of this letter, but I have learnt the following details:- Three or four months ago the young Amir with his uncles, who are his guardians, went on raid to the northward of Jauf and inflicted much loss on the Rowala tribe, which goes in the summer even as far north as Damascus. Rowala tribesmen after wards in revenge invaded Jauf and took prisoner the Amir*s Governor of Jauf, who is his maternal uncle Ali Subhan, and some other persons, and are now demanding the ransom which it is said is 20,000£. An emissary came from the Amir to Mecca to ask for the help or mediation of the Ottoman authorities, and the emissary has returned to Nejd with the above letter, the result of his mission being still unknown. Little can be heard hero of Nejd affairs, but it appears that the expected downfall of Ibn ^aood has not taken place, nor has anything further been heard here of the military or other interference of the Ottoman Government in Nejd men tioned in the now extinct Mecca newspaper ”Shamsul Hakika” as reported in my despatch No.17 of 1909 above referred to. The Grand Shereef, according to a Mecca informant, has lately demanded/ demanded of Ibn ^aood a yearly due of 900£ for the district of Aasira, which has not been paid for over thirty years, and all the arrears for that time, to which demand no reply has been given, and the Grand Shereef is also said to have ordered the inhabitants of Kasim to throw off their allegiance to Ibn Saood and become his, the Grand Shereef*s that is, the Ottoman Government’s subjects, and it is thought probable that he, the Grand Shereef will send a raid into ^asirn* There are vague rumours of Ibn ^aood being now engaged in alliance with the Sheikh of Koweit in a raid against Muntefik Arabs near Bussorah.

With reference to the entries in this office diary for September and October relating to the excursion of the Sharif of Mecca into Najd, I have the honour to report the following information furnished to me by Shaikh Mubarak. 2. The Shaikh told me that in a recent letter received from Abdul Aziz bin Saud he was informed that the Sharif had retired to Najd without any fighting having taken place, but the circumstances of that retirement were vastly different from the current version. It appears that Abdul Aziz was particularly anxious as to the safety of his brother, Saud, who was a prisoner with the Sharif, and consequently it was Abdul Aziz bin Saud who made the first advances towards a settlement by begging that his brother might be released. Though Bin Saud was in far superior force the Sharif seems to have realized his anxiety on his brother’s account and demanded a promise from Abdul Aziz that if he desired the release of Saud and himself to remain the ruler of Kasim and Southern Najd he must agree to pay $6,000 annually as tribute to the Sharif from the revenues of Kasim. Abdul Aziz wrote complying with the terms, Saud w r as accordingly released, and an exchange of presents followed, the Sharif retiring towards Mecca immediately after. • 3. Shaikh Mubarak says that Abdul Aziz having recovered his brother addressed another letter to the Sharif retracting his promise and asserting that it had been given by him under compulsion and w r as therefere void ; in this letter Abdul Aziz also said that he had no quarrel with the Turkish Government, that the Arabs of Najd were poor Bedouin, who admitted the Sultan’s sovereignty and were quite content with Abdul Aziz as their local governor. 4. With his letter to Shaikh Mubarak, Abdul Aziz also asked the Shaikh’s advice as to complaining of the Sharif’s inroad to the Turkish authorities in Basrah and Baghdad. Mubarak told me that he had replied to Abdul Aziz strongly deprecating such a course as most unadvisable for neither the Baghdad nor the Basrah Yali could do any more than write reports to Constantinople, and Abdul Aziz’s complaint might open the door to further expeditions into Najd; that at present “ the door is shut, and if once opened, no matter how little, God knows when it may again be closed. ” 5. Shaikh Mubarak in discussing the incident much regretted that Abdul Aziz had been so foolish as to commit himself to paper regarding a tribute from Kasim (in itself probably unrealisable), as in view of the disparity of forces he could easily have achieved the release of his brother by threaten] ng an advance on the Sharif, but he added Abdul Aziz though powerful amongst the Bedouin had no diplomacy and w r as very unsophisticated. 6. I attach a copy of a Constantinople telegram, which has a hearing on this incident. • &lt;Extract from Telegraphic columns of The Timse, London, 6th October 1910. SUBMISSION OF ARAB TRIBES.

The report reaches me just as I am leaving for Kuwait and I would prefer to defer comment until my return, merely observing that Bin Saud’s emissary, Mashuq, referred to at the end of paragraph 3 of the report did present himself here at Bushire about 6 w’eeks ago with a verbal message purporting to come from Bin Saud. In any case having regard to existing instructions he would have received no encouragement; and as a matter of fact, though his bearing suggested that he was what he professed to be, he carried no credentials or other proof of his identity, so that I had no means of being sure of his 5 ond fides, and therefore treated him with the due circumspection, merely giving instructions that as an Arab stranger in a foreign country he should be supplied with anything he needed in the way of food pending his departure by the next steamer. No. C-17 (Confidential), dated Kuwait, the 8th April 1911. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report below for the information of Government the substance of a number of long and intimate conversations which took place between Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman as-Saud, the Wahabi Amir of Nejd, and myself, when, during my recent tour, I spent some days in his camp. 2. I would first observe that Abdul Aziz gave me the impression of being endowed with a particularly straight-forward, frank and generous nature and such is his reputation among the Bedouin tribes in Central and Eastern Arabia, corroborated, moreover, by every Shaikh from whom at various times I have made incidental enquiries. He treated me most hospitably and in the most genuinely friendly manner, sparing no pains to make my stay with him as pleasant as possible. He and his brothers did not show a trace of the fanatical spirit which might have been expected from the ruling Wahabi family and his advisers and the heads of his forces also treated me and my men with the most cordial friendship; all my questions regarding their country, its customs, resources, etc., were answered in the frankest manner, whilst I was free to wander among the tents and converse with all and sundry without apparently arousing a particle of that suspicion which generally attaches to a foreigner amongst Arabs of the interior. I feel convinced of the correctness of this impression for I frequently discussed matters of doctrine, custom and religion which are held to be anathema by the Wahabi sect and was always answered with calm and intelligent reasoning without a trace of fanatical heat. My object in stating the above is to show that my relations with the As-Saud family were of a suffi ciently intimate description to leave no doubt of their sincerity in what passed between us : indeed, I was habitually addressed as “ Brother ” and if I had been one in fact I could not have been treated more as one of the family. When Abdul Aziz after some conversations on general politics began to ask my opinion on the relations between the British Government and Turkey, the aims of the latter, our views on the same and the like, I said at once that I had not come to discuss politics but to enjoy touring in the desert, and meet him if possible on his native hearth in order to see how Arab Chiefs lived in the desert; moreover, I had no sort of authority to discuss politics with him for we had no political relations with Central Arabian Chiefs and so far as I knew desired none, provided they were content with their own affairs and country and did not force us to protect our interests among the Chiefs along the coast-line as had been2 necessary in former times, when the Wahabi power under Faisal bin Turki had interfered in Oman and Bahrein affairs. Abdul Aziz said he quite understood my position but would be grateful if I would hear what he wanted to say and then if I desired to send on his views to my superiors afterwards 1 could please myself, but that he was glad of the opportunity to “ show his heart ” fully in conversation for he had already sent a secret messenger to Bushire to re-open the old relations with the Resident but that the man carried no letters, and his instructions had only been to see the Resident personally, intimate generally that the As-Saud wished to enter into relations with the British Government and that anything more formal than this might be conducted through the Political Agent at Kuwait. The man’s name, he told me, was Mashuq and he left Abdul Aziz secretly (that is, his purpose and destination were unknown even to the Amir’s brothers and entourage) about the last week of January. 4. Seeing that he was bent upon having his say I explained to Abdul Aziz that I presumed his object was (much the same as that of other Arabs) to bring about some form of relation with the British Government which would enable him to repudiate any more patent allegiance to the Sultan which the Turkish Gov ernment might in the future require of him or his house ; if such was the case I was as nearly certain as I could be without a reference to Government or a discussion that His Majesty’s Government, while always desirous of peace, would not support him, and would not enter into Central Arabian affairs for they had always confined themselves to their interests on the coast-line and had never, so far as I knew, challenged any Turkish claim to the ordering of affairs in Central Arabia; moreover, being on amicable terms with that Government they would be averse from anything of the nature of an intrigue against it. Con sequently he must not expect the slightest support from His Majesty’s Govern ment, that from his isolation in Central Arabia he knew little or nothing of the affairs of nations, that he was not in a position t'o judge such matters and though my w r ords might be unpalatable I felt bound to tell him plainly at once to save future disappointment. Having enjoyed his hospitality and been treated as his intimate friend it would not be fair to him if I permitted him to gather an impression that having discussed political matters with a British Government official he would obtain any support or countenance from that Government or that they would even consider the discussion seriously, when I felt almost certain that the British Government would do nothing to disturb the existing state of affairs. I reiterated my opinion as given above on several occasions and Abdul Aziz always received it as tendered in good faith and with out resentment. 5. Abdul Aziz first pointed out that his suggestions had the approval of his father Abdur Rahman bin Faisal, with whom alqne he had discussed them, for his brothers had not been as yet taken into his confidence in the matter. From separate conversations with them, however, I am convinced that they are of his mind and would certainly support him. In passing I would observe that though both Abdul Aziz and his father Abdur Rahman are known and spoken of as “Imam” or “ Amir ” indiscrimately the actual power and government of Nejd is almost entirely in the hands of Abdul Aziz, his father having virtually abdicated the position of ruler in favour of the son. Note. —A reference to Mr. Saldana’s Precis of Nejd Affairs in Part I of the ' Historical Materials for the Persian Gulf Gazetteer” of October 1904 will be useful as a comparison to what follows. 6. Abdul Aziz recounted a deal of ancient history, of which I give an abbre viated version below, arranged, as far as I have been able to locate it in time, chronologically. 1814—1819. He began with the invasion by Ibrahim Pasha and said that after the Egyp- 1824 tians had been expelled from Nejd his ancestor 1 urki bin Abdulla reconquered most of the original Wahabi dominion, including Hasa, Katif and most of the 1831. Oman coast from Katar to near Maskat, thus removing all signs of Turkish power, and that he then made a treaty with the British Government. 1834- Shortly after this Turki was murdered by Mashari and he in turn was killed by Faisal bin Turki, father of Abdur Rahman and grand-father of Abdul Aziz A.3 ad ad ad se in sn lis !y nt ae ae sn iz &gt;g m v- 36 a e, ‘7 id rs at a- a- le d :e :n :o ,h at It ie al i- is &gt;r n is h LS d :d af IS d ie h d iz who now rules Nejd. Soon after his accession Faisal was attacked by the Egyp tians under Khurshid Pasha and being defeated was taken away a prisoner to Cairo. Faisal, having succeeded after some years in obtaining a pardon, return ed to Nejd and was at once acclaimed as Imam. He also renewed the old treaty with the British Government and established his rule over the whole of the territory formerly under the sway of Turki bin Abdulla. He reconstructed the fort of Baraimi in Oman and with the concurrence of the British Government received a tribute from the Sultan of Maskat of $ 15, 000 per annum. Though at this time Faisal was in frequent communication with the British Government he was not permitted to assist Mahomed bin Abdulla to his rights in Bahrein, the British Resident having already placed one of the Khalifa family in power. The British Government however, in proof of its amity, punished the Bahrein Shaikh when he proceeded to make attacks on the mainland of Katif and Hasa which were then Wahabi property. It was at about this time that the British Government showed how close were their relations with Nejd by sending one of their officers (Colonel Lewis Felly) to Riadh and he renewed the old treaties and friendship though not by an actual written document. Soon after this visit Faisal died and Abdulla his son suc ceeded him and though he at first kept up the former friendly relations with the British Government was fool enough to make overtures to the Turks, after he had quarrelled with the English about Baraimi and Maskat and because he was also in difficulties with his brother Saud, who held part of Nejd and was better liked by the people. Finally Saud defeated Abdulla, who then went to Midhat Pasha, Vali of Baghdad, and got him to invade Nejd on his behalf. When the Turks came to Hasa all the As-Saud family were at feud with each other and the Turks therefore easily seized Hasa and Katif, but they went no further west towards Nejd. The Turks would never have been able to come by land and it was not right on the British Government’s part to have allowed them to come by sea, as British ships have always guarded that and refused to allow armed expeditions on it. Saud represented this to the Resident at Bushire and threw himself on his protection, but as the English would not listen to his representa tions he tried to make an arrangement with the Turks, who promised much but did nothing. In their usual way they wanted Saud to come in person to Baghdad so as to imprison him there and then take the whole of Nejd ; and, w r hen they had agreed to his brother Abdur Rahman bin Faisal going in his place with the promise of a safe conduct they did actually imprison the latter. By this time the Arabs had seen that the Turkish officials, high and low, were not to be trusted and so joined Saud with a view to an attack upon Hasa in order to recover by force what they could not get by diplomacy. Saud, however, was afraid to venture this for the Turks would probably kill his brother in Baghdad, and also because the English would not stop Turkish troops coming into Hasa by sea. When Abdur Rahman was released after three or four years captivity at Baghdad and landed in Hasa he found that the Arabs loathed the Turks and were ready to join him against them. As the Turks were weak owing to sickness and deaths he attacked Hasa fort but before it could be reduced the Turks brought more troops and he left for Riadh. Saud then died and Abdur Rahman became Imam but there was continual war between him and his brother Abdulla bin Faisal who still loved the Turks. Abdulla gradually became stronger and finally was acknowledged as ruler ; he made peace with all his relatives except his brother Abdur Rahman. It was during these years of trouble between the sons of Faisal themselves and between the As-Saud and the Turks in Hasa that the Ibn Rashid family of Hail, formerly vassals of the Wahabi ruler, became so strong and eventually took Kasim and Boraidah. Abdulla bin Faisal tried to re-assert the power of the As-Saud but Mahomed Ibn Rashid was too strong. At the same time there were more dissensions between Abdulla and his relatives so that Abdulla became weak and the sons of Saud bin Faisal took the power from him ; but, Mohamed Ibn Rashid to help Abdulla attacked Riadh, took it and thus became ruler of practically all the country formerly belonging to the Wahabis. He also took Abdulla bin Faisal off to Hail. Abdur Rahman bin Faisal then made an effort to restore the power of the As-Saud, and succeeded in re-taking Riadh from Ibn Rashid’s people but he was not strong enough to \4 1891 . 1897 . 1902. June 1904 ' December 1906. maintain his position and finally was utterly defeated by Ibp Rashid and had to take to the desert, where he wandered about with his family until they took refuge with Mubarak in Kuwait. When Mahomed Ibn Rashid died the tribes which he had held together by his superior political acumen, began to drift apart and the As-Saud saw their opportunity. After a considera ble amount of intrigue Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman, who had been living with his younger brothers and father for some years in Kuwait, left secretly with about 30 chosen men for Riadh, which by a coup de main \\e in a night, and, on proclaiming himself, was hailed with joy by the people as their legitimate ruler. The settled people of Nejd (Southern) who were tired of Ibn Rashid’s rule flocked to him and he soon had a considerable force with which he drove Ibn Rashid’s representatives from town after town until in a year he had again made the As*Saud family a power to be reckoned with. He then recalled his father Abdur Rahman and his brothers and proceeded to win back what he could from Ibn Rashid. He was soon master of Aridh, Sadair, W ashm, Hautah, Mahmal and eventually of Kasim. The surrounding country acknow ledged him and most of the adjacent Bedouin tribes came under his banner. He so increased his power that Ibn Rashid appealed to the Turks and a Turkish force was sent into Kasim overland which together with Ibn Rashid’s force was utterly routed at Boraidah. Following upon this the Turks sent a larger force again into Kasim under Mushir Faizi Pasha, but fighting did not take place as Abdur Rahman met the Mushir and an arrangement was made between them by which parties of this force were left in Boraidah, Anaizah and some of the other towns of Kasim. Shortly afterwards Abdur Rahman went north and had an interview with the Vali of Basrah at Safwan, in which nothing of consequence took place. The Turkish troops in Kasim dwindled owing to disease and deaths and eventually after agreeing to leave behind their arms were given a safe conduct out of Nejd by Abdul Aziz and Mubarak, who sent them from Kasim to As-Safa and thence to At-Towil near Kuwait and thence to Basrah by land. 7. Since this evacuation there have been no signs of Turkish authority in Nejd and Abdul Aziz has so consolidated his power that his word is law over the whole of Nejd from within two days’ march of Hail to the Persian Gulf coast line, excepting only the actual towns of Hofuf, Katif and where the Turks maintain garrisons, and as far south as the Wadi Dowasir. In 1910 the Sharif of Mecca made an expedition to Kasim, whether in his own personal interests or at the instigation of the Turkish Government is not known for certain, but finding Abdul Aziz too strong for him, he left hurriedly after an exchange of presents. Abdul Aziz was hampered owing to the Sharif having in his cower his brother Saad, treacherously captured and handed over by the Ateyba Bedouin. I am assured by Abdul Aziz that no documents passed between him and the Sharif regarding the revenues and Government of Kasim. All the reports published in the Egyptian and Turkish papers are pure fiction invented by the Sharif to save his owm face after he had safely returned to Mecca. He asserts that he made no professions of being the vassal of the Sultan and being a Wahabi does not admit the Sultan’s Khalifate in Islam. The Wahabis hate the Turks only less than they hate the Shiahs of Persia for the infidel practices which both have imported into the true and pure faith revealed in the Koran. 8. Abdul Aziz reverted frequently to the letters which his father Abdur Rahman had sent to the Resident at Bushire about the time of the appointment of a Political Agent at Kuwait and regretted that we had not met his friendly advances with the cordiality of former times. He said that he had given me their history for so many years to prove that the As-Saud had always been in friendly relations with the English and that they had always cordially hated the Turks but once the latter had effected their lodgement in Hasa by sea and were able to maintain their position there by the same means they had not been able to eject them. The As-Saud had frequently mooted the idea of open hostilities but had each time come to the conclusion that an expedition would be fruitless until the ability of the Turks to bring in troops by sea was limited, and that was only possible through the English. The As-Saud bitterly resent the Turkish occupation of Hasa for two main reasons:— {a) The district forms part of the As-Saud ancestral territory as much as Aridh and is5 ©&gt; (§) +■ •* by far the richest, (b) the Turkish occupation deprives the Ruler of Nejd of the natural port to his dominions, and makes the proper control of the Bedouin tribes between the sea and Riadh impossible, with consequent detriment to the commercial prosperity of Nejd. 9. Abdul Aziz also told me that he was not alone in his hatred of the Turks,^ for all the princes of Arabia were in correspondence with each other regarding a combination to attack the Turks simultaneously and drive them out of the country for good and all. He frequently had letters from the Imam Vahyah, from Sayid Mahomed aMdrisi from the Chiefs of the tribes through whose country the Hejaz Railway runs, and the responsible Arabs in .Hasa and Katif begging him to assist in making successful a general revolution through out Arabia. Even Ibn Rashid had made overtures to the same effect, but Abdul Aziz said he was not prepared to commit himself yet as he had the unhappy recollection of how the Turks came to be in Hasa before him and desired to give them no opportunity for a further advance into Nejd. 10. The As-Saud had no ambitions towards an increase of dominion north, west or anywhere except over Hasa and Katif. But above all they desired to be in relations with the British Government, so that the Turkish Government would hesitate to oppress them or to interfere in their affairs in Nejd. Abdul Aziz cited Shaikh Mubarak’s position as nearly as possible representing what he desired adding that the As-Saud were really better off than Mubarak for they had no dealings whatever with the Turks, did not fly their flag like Mubarak and did not admit even the Khalifate of the Sultan. He appealed to the English on the ground of long previous relations and because they were always for peace and justice and could be trusted to keep their promises. The new regime in Con stantinople had already shown its aggressive policy and he feared that before very many years there would be another attempt to subjugate Nejd Though the Wahabis had formerly fought us in regard to the Coastal Chiefs’ affairs they saw the benefit of our rule amongst them and had no wish to alter the present posi tion, though A.bdul Aziz mentioned having received letters from Dibai whose Shaikhs had written after the Hyacinth’s ” gun-running incident, asking to be taken under his protection. 11. He was quite prepared to accept a British Political Agent but as the Turks at present occupied the only two ports which belonged to the Wahabis he could only suggest such an appointment in either Katif or Ojair after the Turks had been made to evacuate Hasa. When that auspicious event should take place he would gladly welcome the British flag as a sign that he would no longer be molested by Turkey. He went on to point out that if the As-Saud controlled Hasa and a British Officer resided at one of the ports, we should be nefit largely by the increased trade which would result from a settled and effective power over the Bedouin who made the trade-routes to the interior so insecure at present. 12. I have given above what passed in some detail for it seemed of impor tance to record a discussion at first hand with the man who at present rules Central Arabia and in the course of which he expressed his views and ambitions with absolute frankness. It will be of advantage to refer in this connection to the correspondence noted in the margin. Un fortunately l had no papers with me in the desert and it was therefore impossible at the time to follow all Abdul Aziz’s references to previous appeals to the Residency. Since my return I find that he does not seem to have exaggerated his side of the case so much as was my original impression. 13. On enquiring how he reconciled the regular receipt of a Turkish Annuity with the claim to absolute independence, Abdul Aziz said that the annuity dated from the time of his father’s (Abdul Rahman bin Faisal) incarceration in Baghdad, was given then for his living expenses and has continued ever since as personal Government of India Despatch to the Secretary of Slate, No. 69, dated 26th March 1904- Bahrein letter No. 238, dated 7th November 1903.

Grey, with enclosure . v* t[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a note on the rebellion in Asir, which has appeared in the Soudan Intelligence Report for the month ot June. The note describes the growth of the influence of the Emir Idris since 1906, and the course of the operations which he has carried on uninterruptedly against the lurks The main conclusions drawn are that the position of the numerous Turkish forces in Asir is much less favourable than is admitted at Constantinople, and that the assistance rendered by the Italians, in virtue of their command of the sea, in the present year has been most effective. Meanwhile the Imam Yehia of Yemen, though at peace with the Central Government, is watching events, and may be ready, if the rebellion in Asir is successful, to cast in his lot with Idris, with ’whose cause many of his followers THE most serious rebellion with which the Turks have had to contend since their conquest of southern Arabia in 1520, broke out in the Yemen in 1905 under the leadership of the Imam Yehia. # . During 1908 the situation was further aggravated by a rising in Asir (a sanjak ot the vilayet of El Yemen, having a population of some 2,000,000, mostly followers of the Shafia Tarika of the Sunni Sect), whereas other districts are mostly Zaidis of the Shia Sect), under the leadership of El Said Mohammed Ibn Ali Ibn Idris, son of Said Ahmed Idris, a descendant of the prophet’s grandson Hassan, and commonly known as ** the Idnsi ” This remarkable man is now about 36 years of n^e, thick set, and of medium stature, with the dark complexion derived from his Moorish origin—the family having come originally from Fez. t- j xi. A religious zealot, he has travelled and studied m Arabia, Inpoli, Egypt, and the Soudan, and adds a knowledge of the world much superior to that of his compatriots to a natural force of character, intelligence, and courage. He has been married to both Egyptian and Soudan women, but divorced the former and left the latter and her daughter with his cousin, Abd El Mutaal, in Dongola. His uncles and cousins possess considerable property both in that province ol the Soudan and near Luxor in Egypt. . t „ Though popularly known as the “Mahdi” of Asir, he absolutely disclaims all divine origin, and professes to be nothing more than a patriot and a reformer, having at heart the two great objects of reforming the abuses of modern Islam and^ establishing an Arabian Caliphate at Mecca in place of the corrupt and oppressive Turkish yoke. He first declared himself at Sabia on the first day of Ramadan, 1906, and by his sincerity and personal magnetism speedily gained the support of thousands of his Arab fellow-countrymen; and threatened to eclipse his then rival insurgent, Yehia of the emen • 1909 : Though originally commencing with the idea of employing none but peaceful methods of reform, he soon came in conflict with Rom I asha the nominee of the Ottoman Government as head sheikh of the Arabs and defeated him on several occasions during 1909, capturing large stores of arms and ammunition.

Memorandum respecting Rebellion in Asir, occu pied in dealing with the situation in the Yemen, towards the end of 1909 concluded [2598 /— 2] B2 a treat v of peace with Idris, under which the internal administration ot the province was virtually left to him, while Turkish interests were to be safeguarded by the appointment of a mutessarif and the control of railways, telegraphs, and schools. 1910: As far as can be gathered Idris loyally carried out his side of the bargain, but Said Pasha was transferred, and his successor failed to continue his policy, with the result that, during 1910, a rupture took place, culminating in Idris leading an army of 20,000 men to besiege Abba, the real capital of Asir, which was fortunately well garrisoned by six battalions with sufficient artillery, under the command of Suleiman Pasha, who had repaired the fortifications, and laid in a large stock of ammunition and supplies. Idris had, on the rupture of relations, dispatched an embassy, composed of Sevyid Saleh and Ahmed Ibn Mohammed El Mujabid, to Constantinople, with the conditions which he was prepared to accept from the Sublime Porte. The chief of these were : the universal enforcement of the Sharia Law, administered by judges of his own choice; the replacement of all the old and corrupt officials; public security to be in his own hands; garrisons to be confined to the capital and certain coastal towns; taxes to be collected by local commissioners and paid into the local treasuries; and certain other administrative reforms of which the net result would have been to establish his independence. The Porte replied by appointing Said Pasha, who had been so successful in ending the previous revolt, as vali. He arrived at Kunfuda in the middle of January and opened negotiations, but the attitude assumed by Khoja Tewfik, who was delegated by Idris to conduct the negotiations, was such as to preclude any hope of a peaceful settlement. The large majority of the tribes sided with Idris, but some of those within the immediate reach of the Turks remained faithful to them. Information coming from either side has been so prejudiced that it has not been easy to arrive at the actual progress of events ; but the following, so far as it goes, is believed to be an approximately correct narrative of the principal operations. 1911: The year opened with Abha in a state of passive blockade, and the small Turkish garrisons at the coast ports of Lohaiya, Gizan, and Kunfuda unable to stir beyond their lines. Idris had some 40,000 armed men in the field, and the Turks were so occupied with their operations in the Yemen and events in Europe as to be unable to spare sufficient troops to take the initiative anywhere in Asir for several months. When Abha was first invested Suleiman Pasha made several sorties, during the chief of which, in December 1910, he inflicted a loss of 280 men on the rebels near Malag. Meanwhile Idris sent forces to hold the roads leading from the ports of Kunfuda, Gizan, Midi, and Lohaiya, to prevent supplies being conveyed from them by the local Wadaiat to Abha and to loyal tribes in the interior. When at length the Turks were able to take the initiative their plan of operations was to relieve Abha by the co-operation of two forces based on Kunfuda. and Gizan or Lohaiya respectively. The northern force, composed of 5,000 well-armed Arabs (horse, foot, and camel) under the command of the Shereef of Mecca, Hussein Pasha, with his two sons, Abdulla and Faisal Beys, and a renowned Arab leader, Ibn-el-Haj, left Mecca on the 15th April, 1911, to effect a junction with three battalions of Turkish regulars with artillery at Kunfuda. Six gun-boats were detailed to co-operate with this army by sea. These were almost immediately employed in bombarding the ports of El Wasm, El Burak and El Shegig, which had been used by the rebels as landing-places for arms and supplies. A number of the shereel’s irregulars melted away during the march from Mecca, and probably not more than 2,000 arrived near Kunfuda about the 29th April. On the 1st May Mukhail, a fortified post some three days north-east of Kunfuda, capitulated to the rebels after a siege of many months, and 250 Turkish prisoners, 500 rifles, ninety-five boxes of ammunition, and two mountain guns fell into their hands. News received at this time from Abha showed that town to be in great straits, and unlikely to hold out for more than a month. Accordingly a relief column composed of the three regular battalions under Bimbashi Zeki, with 400 Arab cavalry under Abdulla Bey (son of the Shereef of Mecca) started from Kunfuda about the 3rd May, and encountered a force of some600 rebels under Ibn Karshan, near the village of Goz-el-Shahih [? CausaJ six hours inland. The Mecca Arabs became panic-stricken and bolted, throwing the Turks into confusion, with the result that the column was completely routed, leaving four officers and 100 men dead on the field of battle, while many more died of thirst on the retreat to Kunfuda. Strong reinforcements arrived shortly after, and on the 10th May the reported strength at Kunfuda included nine regular and redif battalions, with two indifferent camel batteries. Towards the end of May the Shereef, in order to avenge his defeat of the 3rd May, dispatched a force consisting of three regular battalions. 100 Arab cavalry, and 1,100 camel-men, under his son, Faisal Bey, to make a surprise attack on a rebel force occupying an entrenched position at El Goz [? Causa]. After a night march of six hours they readied their objective at dawn, and after a stiff fight of nine hours' duration put the rebels to flight. The latter numbered some 5,000 men under Ibn Kharshan and Mustafa. The Turks lost twenty-eight regulars and tree irregulars killed (of whom twenty died of sunstroke) and the rebels about 150. Much loot in the shape of cattle, transport animals and supplies was taken. Meanwhile the southern force under Said Pasha was not sufficiently strong to leave Gizan, where it was hemmed in. Idris himself was either at his capital, Sabia, or in the impregnable mountain fastness of Abu Safian. On the 1st June rumours (subsequently proved to be untrue) of the fall ot Abba were received. The Turks having had their hands freed by their successes in the Yemen, now commenced to act with more vigour. Said Pasha assumed the direction of operations, and appointed Nashat Pasha to command the northern force at Kunfuda, and Mohammed Ali Pasha to command the southern force at Gizan ; he himself left Hodeidah for Lohaiya on the 14th June. Four regular battalions, comprising 3,000 men, with six mountain guns and two maxims, were concentrated at Gizan, and on the 13th June moved out to Hatayir, under Bageb Bey, to seize the wells of Hali, on which the water supply of Gizan was dependent, apparently with the intention of covering the advance of a force from the direction of Lohaiya. During the morning they had no difficulty in brushing aside the 500 or so rebels who were normally in the vicinity, and halted near the wells in entire ignorance of the immediate proximity of some 10,000 or 12,000 Arabs, who, partially surrounding them without being perceived, attacked and threw the totally unprepared lurks into immediate confusion and rout. During the retreat on Gizan, between 1,000 and 1,600 Turks were killed (probably nearer the latter figure), and the shattered remnant of the force was only saved from annihilation by the fire of two gun-boats. Although the latter killed a considerable number of Turks, who were mixed up with the Arabs, they succeeded in driving oft the latter and inflicting upon them the greater part of the 1,000 casualties which they suffered during the day. Only 400 Turkish wounded remained, as the rebels finished v oft* all they found with daggers. Upon the news of this disaster reaching Hodeidah, reinforcements were hurried on, and in spite of incredible difficulties occasioned by the outbreak of cholera among the troops, and the absolute lack of water at Gizan, where the wells had been lost, and which necessitated condensed water being brought by ship from Perim and Aden, Mohammed Ali Pasha was able to start the Abha relief force before the end of the month. * . . 4 -o It advanced from Kunfuda in two columns by different routes, under Aziz Bey and the Shereef respectively. The former composed of 5,000 Turkish troops, and the latter of about 1,500 Arabs, with fourteen light guns between them. The rebels, under Seyyid Mustafa, were defeated at Goz, and very little resistance was encountered on the road, as the Arabs could not stand up to the artillery file. Abha was relieved on the 16th July. The losses occasioned by the enemy on the march were trifling, but those from sickness were enormous; the Turks admitting over 800 deaths from cholera or dysentery. 1 p . , After the relief of Abha the Shereef'of Mecca separated from the army and w Taif, while Mohammed Ali Pasha was organising a force of twelve battalions with it was intended to pursue Idris to Sabia as soon as the wet weather was over. [2598 f —2] B 2 ent to which4 Meanwhile, the rebels had taken the initiative on the coast, and early in June a force of 5,000 or ^.000 mostly of the Beui Abs tribes under Sherit Mansur, seized the water supply of Lohaiya, situated some 7 miles inland from the town, which was garrisoned by only two and a-half weak battalions. Dissensions, however, broke out among the rebels, and on the arrival of Hamdi Bey with reinforcements from Hodeidah they retired. Hamdi established an entrenched post there and left two companies with one gun to protect the wells. Lohaiya itself is a walled town with several detached forts on commanding hills outside, and much better adopted for defence than Gizan. 1912: At this stage a new and important factor was introduced, namely the offensive action of the Italian fleet against the Turks in the Bed Sea, which immediately destroyed the latter’s command of the sea and directly aided the insurgents by the co-operation of Italian ships with the insurgent land attacks on the fortified ports. The first instance of this combined action occurred at Midi where, after a close siege, involving much desultory fighting, the naval bombardment brought about an unconditional surrender on the :29th February. Early in April the Italians extended their zone of investment to include Lohaiya and the Kamaran Islands which latter had previouslv been exempted so as not to interfere with the important pilgrim quarantine station thereon. After the success at Midi the investing force was divided, a portion being dispatched to Muhail to contain Suleiman Pasha at Abha, and the remainder under Seyyid Mustafa, to the fort of Kunfuda, where the co-operation of the Italian fleet was expected. The effect of the latter did not apparently reach their expectations, and the siege was raised. At about the same time, the investment of the port of Lohaiya was commenced, and towards the end of April 1912 the situation was as follows :— The Turkish forces, commanded by Suleiman Pasha and Shereef Faisal (son of the Shereef of Mecca), number in all about 15,200 regulars with 6,500 Arab auxiliaries, were distributed as under : — 6.000 regulars and 2,000 Arabs, of Asir and Zahran, under Suleiman Pasha at Abha. 4,500 regulars and 200 Arabs, of Harb and Zebid, at Kunfuda. 3.000 regulars and 3,000 Arabs, of Wadaat and Abs, at Lohaiya. 1,600 regulars and 400 Arabs, of Mecca, under Shereef Faisal at Dogar. 50 regulars and 500 Arabs, of Shenabra, in Leyt. The force in Lohaiya was strictly invested by four columns of Idris’s army by land, and blockaded by the Italian fleet by sea. Provisions were said to be running short. The Shereef Faisal (son of the Shereef of Mecca) on his march southwards was held up at Dogar by the intervening hostile tribes. Suleiman Pasha at Abba, though not closely besieged, was being watched by a small rebel-containing force and appears powerless to move. The Imam Yehia of Ei Yemen, who concluded peace with the Turks towards the end of 1911, finds himself in a difficult position. Bound by his conditions of peace to help the Turks, he is not at all certain that ho is on the winning side, and many of his followers openly sympathise with the Idrisi. The pretext that the latter has accepted help from the Christians has been , sufficient t&lt;&gt; enable him to get together a small contingent of some 300 men who are with the Turks in Lohaiya. This is hardly sufficient to prejudice him in the eyes of Idris should the latter eventually succeed. The Idrisi has assembled under arms some 46,000 of the 200,000 fighting men who are reported to be at his call in case of need. Of these he retains 25,000 (of whom 500 are cavalry) with him at Harad, where he has established his head-quarters. Six thousand, divided into four columns, respectively under the command of the following emirs of the Beni Mirwan tribe :— Mohammed Bakri, Tahor Ali, Mohammed Yehia Ma'wiz, Haidar Mohammed Mohajab,—&amp; _* . ^0. 5 are investing Lohaiya ; the first and second columns being stationed at Wadi-el-Fajj on the south, the third column at Wadi Hiran on the north, and the fourth on the east. The remaining 15,000 are distributed at Maheil (near Abha watching Suleiman Pasha) and amongst the coast towns of Shekeik, El Wasm, El Berk, and Halli. The Idrisi is said to have seventy guns of sorts, some of which were taken from the Turks at Gizan and Midi, whilst twelve field and eight mountain guns were recently acquired from the Italians, in addition to an ample supply of rifles and ammunition. His rifles are of four kinds, known as— 1. Ann Nabbut. A good weapon of Italian origin. 2. Abu Isbaa. A French rifle from Jibuti. Probably the “ Gras.” ^ 3. Mausers of old pattern. 4. Mausers captured from the Turks, which constitute their best weapon. He has a fleet of sailing-boats (“ sambuks ”), which are available for his coastal communications, since the Italians have assured him the command of the sea. The large majority of the tribes have declared for the Idrisi, only those in immediate contact with the Turks rendering them any assistance. Amongst the most important insurgent tribes may he mentioned— The Bani Marwau. The Ghamed Zahran. The Harb tribe from between Kunfuda and Leyt. Some of the Zind from the Yemen. Some of the Abs. Kadis of good repute who preside at courts of justice proceeding strictly on the lines of the Sheri law have been appointed to every tribe. . The most important wazirs are— Mohammed Yehia-el-Hadrami, a rich merchant. Yehia Zakari-el-Hadrami, who acts as Director-General of Finance. Mohammed Taber, who led the assault at Gizan. El Seyyid Mustafa, who distinguished himself at the last siege of Abha. All are notables of Sabia. The Idrisi accepts aid from Italy as a common enemy of the Turk, in spite of much criticism against incurring obligations to a Christian Power. In his army are to be found a miscellany of Turks, Abyssinians, Sudanese, &amp;c., who perform most of the technical duties, but no European officers. He now claims as his own the district bounded, on the north by Leyt, on the south by the Wadi Hiram, on the east by the Yam and Zind countries, on the west by the Red Sea, and, in fact, effectively occupies the whole of this country with the exceptions of the invested Turkish garrisons of Abha, Leyt, Kunfuda, and Lohaiya. It includes the following ports commencing from the north :— Halli. El Berk. El Wasm. El Shekeik. El Goz, about three hours north of Gizan. Gizan, the port of Sabia and Abu Arish. El Wahsla, the port of Madaya, about half-way been Gizan and Midi. Midi, about half-way between Gizan and Lohaiya. Habl, about half-way beween Midi and Lohaiya. His capital is Sabia, a large well-built town some 20 miles north-east of Gizan and 12 miles east of El Goz. Such is the enthusiasm for his cause amongst his followers that it is said that mothers do not lament their sons who die fighting for him. From the above it is evident that the Turkish position in Asir is not nearly so favourable as they see fit to represent it.

Letter f*roi HhaiKh Sir Mubarait t-o Bin Baud dated 14th October 1914. After oompliaente, May God keep you in safety! I send you herewith in letter No. I the purport of a comiaunioation which I have received from Colonel Cox the former Agent at Bushire who is now Foreign Seo- -reuary of the Glorious (Government at n imla with the reins of affairs in his hand, and he is the man whom you and I bo Js know to be our friend. You should read these words carefully and consider their meaning well. According to what I hear this war is entirely the fault of the Germans, and they are inciting the -Pumlcs: May God abase them both 1 otherwise my son they (Ger- -mans) will give the Tanes entire control over you and ae and over all the Arab.*, and you know the enmity of the Turks towards the Arabs. And God has hewn favour to the Arabs and Islam ge- -nerally by bringing the Glorious UngliBh Government in.o ex- -istence, it is they who protect their Muslims in India and also our Arab Muslims of whom are you and your followers and I and mine. You see that all the Arabs are in God’s care then in that of the Glorious Government, we have experienced how they keep (harm) away from us. And you and I whom, please Mod, all the Arabs will follow must Keep to our friendship with the Glorious Government, if we do not help them we must at least refrain from interference and not listen to the seductions o^ tiid Germans. By following the wishes of the Glorious Government we shall find our own happiness, and we have to be grateful to them my son, since our help is not nece5sary to uhea as theirs is o us. Our comfort and welfare is from God then from them and may God never cause the others to reign over us who will injure us, namely the Turks and the Germans who are inciting them! And the Glorious Government and her allies are now gain- -ing, and later, please God, the Germans will go altogether. The enclosed is the good tenoux 1 of colonel v^ox s communication itit is also written by the Kindness ox' the Glorious Government to shew their good intentions towards us and all the Arabs. And they do not want to fight the Turks and will only do so in oase of the Turks deolaring war or oommitting some aot which will necessitate it. Then the Turks will go, and the English will rule over Turkish territory: probably this will be the punishment from God for the Turks on account of their bad in- -tention^ towards (treatment of) the Arabs. Therefore mj* son, you and I must follow the wishes of the Glo rious Government for therein lie our own interests to have regard to which is incumbent upon us.Letter from Shaikh Sir l^ubars^c to Bin Saud dated 14th October 1914.

Tfe have received your august communication dated the 14th Zilhijjah 1332 ( 3rd November 1014) in which you state that your honour has already mentioned in your previous letter that the exalted Government of Great Britain has de clared war against the Ottoman Government and that you have been ordered by the illustrious Government to invite us to co-operate with the Shaikh of Wuhammareh and the Ruler of Kuwait - our cordial friends and sincere allies - and attack Basrah and liberate it from the Ottoman Governments or come to Basrah and prevent any reinforcements reaching it or Qor- nah&gt; until the British troops arrive to seize the place; and you mention the liberation of Basrah and its severance from the Turkish dominions&gt; which is one of our chief objects, in this connection, and ask us to prevent plundering of goods belongin to the British merchants in the town of Basrah and its neighbourhood and to protect them from damages and turn out the Turkish troops from A1 Hassa and Qatif and banish them from our town. The co-operation with the above-mention ed two friends is incumbent upon us (and so is it for us to) use our good offices with our friends, the illustrious Government, in all useful actions which may be required by her. And I am using my endeavours and efforts in furthering the common interests of all friends. You should rest fully assured and be confident in this question. I am one of the greatest helpers to the Government of Great Britain and she will, God willing, obtain satisfactory results as we have mentioned to our mutual friends, Captain Shakespear. As to the Ottoman soldiers, we did not allow a single one of them to remsin (in these parts) after our occupationocoupation and have turned them all out. But as to the following three matters mentioned by you, namely, the promise of the exalted Government to protect and safeguard us against the Ottoman Government by affording us her assistance and her future protection ^to us) against any attack and hostility which -ay be made by sea, uer re cognition of th* 4 ndenendence of my chiefship on all the parts of Najd, Al-Hassa and Qatif, and fche conelusion of treaties between us, will depend on our arrival at Kuwait. I am leaving my headauarters on this rt-te *nd am bou^d for Miwalt and we will mrke the necessary verbal negotiations in order that we may earn the approval of our friend, the Government of Great Britain.

Let it not be hidden from you that some days ago Sayid Talib-an-Naqib came to me here at Buraidah. His coming is due to the state of Turkish affairs and to the hiii-h£nd 3 d treatment that he had received at the hands of the Turks during the last two years,and then to the arrival of Javld at Basrah,and the fact that under the guise of warlike measures the Turks started pursuing their personal motives against him — motives which it is difficult to explain except verbally at interview. Placing his trust tn the old relations vu'osisting between us and his family generally and particularly between him and myself persc^lly,Baiyid Talib managed to secure a mission for himself from the Inspector of Turkish War affairs some ?,0 days before his departure,and this mission enabled him to leave Basrah and afforded h&amp;mfim. molestation Irfa any body. Hi is now in :ny company and we are proceeding to your side. I have received a letter from my friend Captain Shakespear asking fcfcx me to see hiin,iind I have written, him a reply appointing a place for our meeting. On our meeting I shall explain to him matters which no doubt he will report to you and which concern the interests of the Arab race and the confirmation of the old rela tions between us and the hi h British Governnent. /e still abide by our old relations and nothing will change our attitude but things that may be harmful to our religion and the Arab race. You are the best of people with regard to this matter and we hope fromyou every good. As regards the dealings of Jaiyid Talih with us and with you,they are not according to what has been made out by mischievous people from motives of self-interest.The truth vvill become appa rent, and he is one of the people who deserve respect and consideration. We have now ar ived at a lace called Mustavi, and have heard of your arrival at Basrah and of the occupation of the place by the British troops and of the just and good treatment and consideration you have shown to the populace, ihis makes me all the more thankful. As I have (at Basrah) my trusted people deserving of respect like Abdul Latif al Man- dail end his family,I thought it fit to make this known to you. I shall be thankful if you will kindly keep in mind these and all my subjects belonging to ftejd and now residing in the districts of Basrah and Zubalr. Complimentary ending.ENCOOSURS 2. Trannlation of a letter to Mir Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahinan A1 Faisal T VBin Baud”,dated the F9th 'M- harram I3B3,corresponding to I7th December X9I4. After compliments. Your honoured letter of I7th •viuharram 1333 has reached me in a fortunate hour here at Kama,by the hand of our friend Abdul Latif itn landil. I was very glad to get it and also to re ceive your expression of satisfaction at learning of our occupation of B&amp;srah and the Shatt-al-Arab,and of the contentment of the inhabitants. Bince then our troops have occupied lurna. The place is conveniently situated for defence,and upto a certain point the Tories fought their guns well,but ultimately they gave up the fight,and nearly 1300 of them were made prisoners,and altogether upwards of 20 guns have so far been captured from them. It is not hidden from you that the British v Grovernnent had no wish to go to war vith Turkey,but her hostile actions,resulting from the intrigues and incitement of Germany,were so intolerable that we had no alternative. But as we have explained to the people of wasrah and Kurna,it is the Government of Turkey only with which we are at war,and we have no object against the people of the country and the Arabs. On the contrary we wish to be their friends and suppor ters and hope that under the British flag they will enjoy the utmost freedom and justice both in regard to their religion and their secular affairs. Especial^ ly in regard to religious matters you need be under no sort of apprehension. It is not hidden from you that the British Government has more Auhamaadan sub jects than any other Government, and you will have3a0n from the Proclamation,of which I enclose a printed copy, that v/e have expressly undertaken to respect and preserve the holy places of pilgrimage hoth in the Hejaz and Mesopotamia. As for yourself I hope that as the result of what has happened your affairs will prosper more than before,because your territory will become free from that annoyance and interference on the part of the Turks from which you have suffered hitherto. As regards your friend oaiyid ¥alib,I met his esteemed father at Basrah and told him what was in my mind regarding his son,and it was to this effect. Upto the declaration of war he did not cease to make claims to us which were not possible of acceptance, and did not agree to the favourable terras offered to him; yet the British Government is forgiving, end though iaiyid Talib has been ill-advised and misled yet neither the Government nor I,its representative, have any ill-will against Balyid Talib. But what I thoughtwas necessary in his case was that,for rea sons which you will understand, it wou A bo better that he should not return to Sasrah for a time until the affairs and the inhabitants of the town had settled down. A little later 1 shall be wuite ready to see him and talk over his affaiw^vith him,and if then his attitude is satisfactory and he submits to the wishes of the Government,I may be able to re commend his being allowed to return to Basrah on suitable terms. I hope by the time this reaches you our friend Captain ahakespear will be with you,and he will inform me of what passes between y )U,and you may be sure that they will be regarded by myself and the British Government with all sympathy. In the meanwhile,inshallah,we shall not fail to show consideration to your friends and dependents ■ ■*- . i. L . t . ' such as Ibn ..Landil in Basrah and Zubaii*. -3KCLG3URE. NO. 3. Trannlotion of a letter from Abdul Aziz bin Gaud dated the 2?,nd liharram I3v ; 33 corresponding to the I^th December 1914. After compliments. I have already sent you a letter informung you that I am on my way to this side and that Ian awaiting laptain Shakes;'-ear r s arrival for a meeting as desired hy him. I also informed you regarding the corning of Saiyid Talih Nac,ib to me,and his good intentions which are for your interests and not in any way opposed thereto. I informed you that at our meeting I would explain to you what it was ne cessary to explain. The reason for coming was fckxfe to strengthen the foundation of friendship and sincerity and to explain the facts about the said Saiyid for whom I have a great regard,and in whose sincerity and right-mindedness,which is the result of his knowledge and friendship with you,I place confidence, And be cause the said Captain has not arrived jcKfc here upto now, I aa obliged to await him here as I do not know what time he might come. I have therefore found it necessary to send you Haji Julaiman Faizi with the letter and have as^ced to explain to you ray own and laiyid Talib’s views,and I tell you with all clearness that ouiyid Talib has been a friend to you for a long time. He aha also known my views and has constantly warned me against the Turks and urged on me the neces sity of relations with you and of friendship with you. Now as regards his intercourse with the Turks during the v/ar f which was assumed put of fear lest his family and dependents should suffer from their treachery and deceit. This will no douht be forgiven him just as he will not be forgiven if after your occupation of Basrah he be guilty of any act against you. Believe:ae that if he gives you an unlartaking he will never violate it^and profit will accrue fro a it in future. He has influence v/ith the chief people auong the Jiu- £ haunadanB and Tabs,and he in one of the sincere peopJ^ and l endorse whatever undertaking he gives you. If this suits you and you think it suitable to call him t Basrah and to please his aind with what is suitable for the dignity of the hi^ti ;a*ltlsh Government,! shall thereby be greatly obliged ani thank your kindness and ny attachment will increase, ihls will give great sa tisfaction to the rab public. They will believe that this act is an example for others, 1 request you not to pay attention to the talk of lying Jealous indivi- Uualf* who had a good deal to do with A and me before. I request an early and favourable reply by the hands of the bearer of this letter. »sacijosiws. i.o. 4. Translation of a letter from tiaiyid ialib.Kaqito- zaiah.to uir P.Z Gox, olitical Officer with the Indian Scpedltionary Perce,dated the 2.°.nd Juharram I3o5.cor- roaponding to the 10th December Is* 14# 1 After compllnents. Let it not .e hidden from you that two yejirn ago v/hen I.like the other Arab vila- yate, asked for reforas in our towns(province),the Tur kish Government accused me of being Inclined towards your good dovemment. From that ti.ue the Turkish Go vernment has suspected me and its mind has been poi soned against me. Owing to this,my confidence in the Government disappeared,so much so that 1 had to go in fear of my life. I had been communicating with your high Government before the declaration of war through Lhaikh Khazal Khan,the Oonsul at Miaansreh and the Consul at 3asrah,and the result of ^ne comnunicatlons then held is not hidden from you. iy oomamnlcations with the British Government were held not only then out before then also,viz,with Lord Kitchener when he was in Egypt, when the war was declared,and the Turkish troops in Basrah increased in number and the fighting was hot,they (i.e the Turks) began to put pressure on me to collect tribes to fight with you,and they pressed me to do things which I could not do against your -o- vernnent. They even compelled me to sign tele Tams written by the Commandant of troops at k„ishla,and he insisted on my signing them to (the address of) the people of Bahriyah and Kiyadiyah,which I could not pos. sibly refuse. In the circumstances I found the best course was to go out of Basrah in order to save myself from their demands which did not suit my ways and view; which have been in your favour from of old. I discussei . I i!/N this matter with ;&gt;haikh POiazal l^lian.who also consi dered it (i.e departure from Basrah) advisable,for the reason that if I had acted against the wishes of the Turks and dealt idd&amp;i mm openly with you t my life and the lives of ray children and of ray family, and my property,all of them would have been in great danger and they would have Kdlled me as they were in a stro*/ position, I therefore secured an order from the ins pector of the v/ar affairs stating the necessity of calling out Bin c&gt;aud to fight with you# This order was dated 20 days before the time (i.e before the order was given ?},and was the means of my getting out of Burin is such a manner that nobody could pre vent me.

For this reason I left Kuwait and came to the said Amir* The letter which the Amir has written to Japtain Jiakespear.in which he has explained to the latter that my views and intentions are in your favour and in no degree against you,will demonstrate the fact that I do not ask him (i.e Bin ,aud) to do anything against you.

All this is not hidien from the Christian British Missionaries at Basrah,and the forner^ Consul at Basrah,Jr. Crow,was aware of it. The very fact that i have never displayed any activity against you,ei ther before or after the war,and the treatment meted out to me by the works,these (in themselves) are jjreat arguments proving that I support your views and desire to be with you in soul and body. 1 am now sending you the bearer of thi^s letter,Haji Bulalman Faizi,formerly a sasrah deputy, to represent me and inform you of what is necessary.

He found Bin Saud Between liajma' and Zilfi. I extract therefrom following general information from political and military standpoint. ThBBB was unaffected rejoicing at our capture of Basrah and aurnah: Hritish proclamations^ holy places greatly appreciated and Jihad has no support. Turks plan previous to declaration of war was as follows :- Bin Baud and Bin iiashid were urged to become recon ciled. Bin Saud was asked to defend Basrah and Baghdad against British advance. Bin Rashid and Malzah were to join ,'estern tribes in advance on Sinai Peninsula and Egypt. 3&amp;arif of Mecca, Imam and Idrisi were to defend Yemen Hfcjaz and holy places. Bin Saud,Sharif and maizah decided to hold together and latter tribe promised to join in opposition to Bin Rashid. According to reliable information from other sour ces, instructions to Bin Saud from Enver Pasha were ac companied by £ 10,000/- for his expenses. In reply to the Turks he expressed his inability to be reconciled to Bin Rashid,and pretended that owing to latter’s hostility he could not come North at once to pro tect Mesopotamia and thus leave Nejd unprotected.but must wait until Bin i-ashid moved on Egypt. He thus avoided co-operation with the Turks and took a line which in no vy&amp;y projudicsd British intQi* 33 ts» Bin Rashid has four Turkish Officers with him butno gins and is in weak position,and Bin Baud is now on his way to attaokf^ind hopes to round him up hy end of January if he has not moved too far westwards.

No. 69-B,dated the loth January IrflS. My immediately preceding telegram. Following is xfcfcix Bin Saud’a attitude vis a vis British Government. Being ultimately disappointed of our intervention in his behalf in April 1314 he was obliged to come to an un derstanding with the Turks sufficient to secure him immu nity from their aggression. His hopes of material support were somewhat revived by the intimation of October 1314 that Captain Shakespear was being deputed to him with a message from British Government,but without possessing a definite treaty with us he could not in any case have responded in a direct way to our later request that he should advance on Basrah^even had thore been time. Short of that,however,he endeavoured to take such a line of ac tion as would indirectly further our policy v/ithout bring ing hiia irrevocably to a rupture with Turkey* Neither can he now committ himself any further pitil he possesses a signed treaty giving him a solid guarantee of his position under the aegis of Great Britain. He is already embarrassed by the difficulty of his present position. If treaty is not soon concluded he fears that force of circumstances may drive him to give some overt demonstration of his intention to side with the Turks. On the other hand directly it is concluded he can be depended on to come off the fence and use all his resources and influence on our side. In order to expedite a settlement,Bin Baud submits a memorandum in which he sets down his ideas tentatively as a basis for $1 a formulation of a treaty. The following is A brief summary cff conditions as numbered by hijp. ./lore to follow.V* ThluffiiiiAM, From - Jir ?. cox,Jaarah. To foreign,Delhi.

He should undertake :- One. To receive representative of British uovernment either at his Capital or sea-port or both,if desired. Secondly. To agree to exterritoriality for our non- Muhannada. subj eE-ts. Thirdly. To abstain from all interference with Tru- cial Coast and ^atar. Fourthly. To abstain from waging wtA L&gt; sea .vatiiout our consent,and to co-operate for suppression of piracy. Fifthly. To protect pilgrim trafiic passing through his territories. Sixthly.

To agree to location of Post Cf::ice and pos sibly TelegrapI Office at his port when the time comes. I do not include any item regarding slave trafiic as that is not nowadays a serious difficulty and has given us no trouble at Kuwait, The only point regarding which it seerns necessary to offer special comnent here is the question of protection against extemil aggression by land. When we invited Bin Saud to move on B&amp;srah we undertook to protect hi.a against reprisals on the part of the Turks,so that as far as the latter are concerned what Jin jaud now asKs us to give does not amount to much more. Apart from the Turks'I Central .^abia in practically inacceBiible by land to any Power but ouraelves,and I venture to think that we should incur little risk by giving the desired underta king subject to the reservation that the aggression be unprovoked. .70 have publicly declared that our object is to effect the liberation of the Arabs from the oppressive yoke .of Turlcey. In this case there is no question of annexation of territory to which our allies could take QXception f while Bin 3aud f s weight in the scale on our side would be no mean asset to the joint cause of j&amp;g us all. Can I possibly be authorised to draft a treaty on above lines for negotiation by Shakespear? I shall not now have opportunity of meeting Bin oaud myself. I an obliged to give Mn Saud some reply by his messenger who has orders to return at once. I am sending Bhakespear the purport of the above additional points and asking him to use his discretion to discuss them with Bln Laud. To Bin Saud I am replying that I hope that an instrument safeguarding his position to his sa tisfaction can be arrived at somewhat on the lines indicated;that I have telegraphed to Goverument on the subject but that treaty mast necessarily take a little time to draw up. That meanwhile he should bear in mind that the Turks have been worsted at all points and are in a very weak position,so that there can be no need whatever for him to committ himself now to any action on their beh: If which could prejudice his position in the ayes of His Majesty's Gpvernment and that it is of— ORIGINAL* mEGRAM.

I hope the cause of your silence is good. I beg to inform you about A1 Araif. I had hinted to you about* them that they were in Oman and that the people of Oman, especially the son of Zaid and his followers, were helping them. My friendship with the High British Government was the reason of theirdoing this. Their intention was that A1 Araif should join A1 Ajraan in fighting (against me) as the latter are friends of the Turks and belong to the part 7 /’ of their advisers. They were the cause of my fighting with Bin Rashid. Bin Rashid sent to them from Turks great deal of money as a bribe• Then they used high handedness on the boundary of Bin Subah &amp; Koweit. When God disgraced Bin Rashid I asked them to repay Bin Subah and to accept punishment for the treatment they had meted out to him. The assistance on account of A1 Araif and of the Oman people and the money sent to them by Bin Rashid has strengthened their intention to do mischief. For this reason fighting has taken place between them and myself. Upto now I have not ordered my forces to come down to Rasa but I have warned my people and the people of Nejd to appear within ten days if God wishes.

Following letter has been received from Bin Saud by N Sla/ftlkh laa:- inform you that in these days I made a night attack against A1 Ajman. As I had a large force and no arrangement to take water with me I thought the night time was cooler for my forces as far as water wan concerned. You know this country; the days are hot. When we reached near them, we found them awake and ready. They had posted watchmen who fired while the Arabs were still far from us. Some of my force were ignorant of the ways of fighting. They remained where they were and began to fire from far off, whifcfe nobody was near them. When I saw that the day was breaking p nd that the attack had proved futile I returned to my dear town, by the grace of God quite safely. They suffered loss and we killed many of them. They, by the grace of Cod, did not kill more than 20 of my men. Among these none was distin guished except my brother 3ad bin Abdui* Rahman who fell at a distance. Inshallah, they are the lowers. I am now waiting for the Arabs and tribesman from Nejd. Before coming down (to Hasa) I had not good information about them.

I sent my interpreter to shaifch ^sa to asX him to seize it, hut he replied that he did not wish to raaKe the Araif more hitter against him than they already were^and asxed me to seize it myself. I accordingly went out to Uram Haoaan and found that four os of ammunition had been landed there from a Qatar boat/ but had been reshipped in the early morning, as the viiiag- -ers did not want to get into troubl . They said that Shaixn Abdullah bin Than! had refused to allow the aramuni- -tion to be landed in Qatar, and that the man in charge, an Araif, had wanted to fceep it in TJmm Hassan till ho could get a boat which was coming to Bahrain from the Qatlf coast.

We have received the following information from Suk-us- Shiyukh. Bin Rashid and the Shareef of Mecca are said to be friendly. The Shareef's son is now in the neighbour hood of Anaizah, he has come towards Nejd in order to support Bin Baud's brother against Bin Baud. Bin Rashid is said to have sent out orders to Shanmar to assemble by 3rd November at a place some 80 miles south of Nasiriyah to support AJaimi. Please try to obtain urgently any news bearing on the above from Koweit Cox ends HOLLAND. Reply dated 1st November. In reply to your 2619 B. The following is the information obtained from Shaikh Mubarak and Bln Baud's messenger who arrived at Koweit on 29th November. After their defeat by Bin Baud the Ajman retreated to the North, and they are now near the coast at a short distance north of Katif, hemmed in by Nejd forces, Koweit force, and various friendly tribes such as the Bani Khalid on the other three sides. They tridd to break through to the North recently but were defeated by Bani Khalid losing 36 killed and 300 prisoners. They are expected to surrender en bloc shortly. Bin Rashid and the Sharif are still at enmity. Bin Baud and his brother are as friendly as ever. Any combined action on the part of the Shammar is believed to be impossible at present, as they have difficulty in getting supplies and are compelled to forage in small parties.

Dated Kuwait, bovenber 2&amp;th IjIS, Sir, I have the honour to address you in continua tion of my memorandum No 34 C dated 15th inst. on the subject of the Amir Bln Saud and the Ajman tribe. 2, The two Ajman Shaikhs who are in command of the forces of their tribe now operating against Bin Baud, viz. Shaikh Dhaid&amp;n of the Hathailan section and Shaikh Khamaiyis of the Sufran section, recently approached Shaikh Salim bin Mubarak with a view to peace. He replied that he had no power to receive their submission, and that they must apply either to his father Sir Mubarak at Kuwait or to Bin Saud himself, and offered to send a deputation under escort to vhiohever of the two they might prefer. After some dis cussion it was decided that Shaikh Dhaidan with a few fol lowers should proceed to Kuwait and there make unconditional surrender, Khanaiyis remaining with Shaikh Salim. 3. The party arrived here on the /Oth inst., and were favourably received by Sir Mubarak who has accepted their submission upon a promise of future good behaviour and possibly other terms which have not yet been communicated to me. On the 20nd a messenger arrived from Bin Gaud requesting Mubarak not to treat with the Ajman Shaiks, but A. it was then too lat* for this request to be considered evenif the Shaikh would have considered it ; which is unlikely, as the feelings of the Ajair in regard to the Ajman v.ere believed to be ferocious in the extreme, and it was even said that a general massacre of such as fell into his hands would have followed upon a surrender to himself. 4. At the first glance it might ap; ear that this termination of the campaign, however satisfactory from a humanitarian point of view, is a little hard on Din Saud who, setting aside the loss of his brother Sa*ad, has suffered consider ably more at the hands of the Ajman than they have at his* But it nay be urged in reply that without help from Kuwait Bin Baud would have been powerless to continue operations after his defeat in the night attack at Hofuf in which Ba’ad lost his life, and that the promises of the Ajman to Mubarak include an undertaking to submit to the authority of the Amir of Nejd and Hassa in whose territory so many of them reside. It is believed that Bin Saud after the first sense of annoyance has passed off may realise that the prospect of help from the AJnan in the future outweighs whatever satisfaction he might have derived frou the extirpation of the two sections who had taken the field against him. 5. -hile it is therefore unnecessary for us to do other than approve of the peace which has made, I think we might A evince our sympathy /dth the troubles of Bin Baud,and cur oesire to help him to :reserve order in the future,by taking some notice of the part played by Hamdan bln Zaid AX Khallfah Shaikh of Abu I^iabi, in connection with this affair. This \ chief, who ls ; in common with other Trucial chiefs,in treaty relations with us, has Joined in the intrigue against Bln Baud by supplying or attempting to supply his adversaries with munitions of war and affording an asylum to Sulaiman A1 Araif besides urging the A1 Murrah tribe to support the AJman. If I am instructed later to pay another visit to Qatar in connection with the proposed treaty with ShaikhAbdullah bln Jaalra it also ba oanvenlont to allow me to proceed to Abu Dhabi and represent to Shaikh K&amp;mdan bln Saif our view of hie conduct in natter; and the oppor tunity might be taken at the same time to inform him that we should regard with grave dlepleaeure any attempt on hie part to encourage a revolt again*t the authority of Shaikh Abdullah of Qatar whose elder brother Khallfoh 1 b believed to be sup ported by Haadan in the attitude of opposition to Abdullah which h© has adopted. This course would certainly have the effect of encouraging Shaikh Abdullaii and would, 1 suspect, go some way toward® overcoming his fear of permitting British subjects to reside In his territory. 6.

As for the rebellious Ajman, having been severely harried, they marched northwards and I have heard that they have ashed Bin Subah to intercede with me to pardon them for what they have done; but, as it is not hidden from you, I have fought them only for molesting Kuwait subjects travel ling through their land, and now Bin Subah is requesting me to raafce peace with them; but this contrary to wisdom, and against the laws prevailing among nations.

Dated Kuwait, December 23nd, 101b Sir, / I have the honour to refer to my letter No C37 dated 25th ultimo, reporting the fact that peace had been made between the late Shaikh of Kuwait, fighting on behalf of the Amir Abd-ul-Aziz bin Baud, and the AJman tribe. This condition of affairs proves to be an unfortunate legacy for the new ruler. Shaikh Jabir and his brother Salim', who will continue to superintend the Kuwait Beuouin tribes as hitherto, do not v/ish to be on bad terms with Bin Baud whom they cannot hope to control as their father difi, and on the other hand they fear that the Ajman might join Bin Rashid and give endless trouble were they summarily ejected from Kuwait territory. Shaikh Jabir has written a very sensible letter to Bin Saud putting the matter clearly and reasonably and urging him not to continue hostilities. T. I have no idea how the negotiations with Bin Saud stand at present and therefore do not know what his exact status is in relation to us, but I can only suggest that, should Jabir’s efforts to bring Bin Saud to accept the position in regard to the Ajman be unsuccessful, the terms upon which the Amir is disposed to treat for peace might be ascertained and communi cated to me; X may then be able to arrange some compromise which will be agreeable to all parties. 4.

Translation of letter from myself to Bin Baud pointing out a clerical omission in the Arabic saving that I was correcting the original bef^e submission to Government, and asking him to correct his copy. 9. The last enclosure explains itself. I much regret that this clerical error should have occurred and that it should have escaped notice alike by the scribe, and by Bin Saud and my self. I should explain that I had not detected it when I des patched my telegram above quoted. 1 can only plead in pallia tion the difficult conditions of light and expe ition under which the documents were faired, read and compared. There can be no doubt that Bin Saud will endorse the correction, and assuming that to be the case, I trust the text of the Treaty will appear to Government sufficiently satisfactory toto justify its acceptance and ratification* Had Bin Saud been able to renain another day and thus r;ive me a second seance, it mifftt have been possible to manoeuvre him closer to the text of the Britidi draft. On the other hand, it is also possible that had he not been anxious to conclude th»/ business at one sittinp;, he might have been less ready than he was to meet me half way in re ar to points of difference. 3 .

The words 'designation of his successor' (by the living Ruler), lie word translated 'designation' was 'tansib' in Bin Paud f s draft.

I could not get Bin Baud to accent the con dition of British approval as worded by us. I pointed out to him that in the absence of such a clause we might perhaps find ourselves com mitted to support an incompetent son# designa^ ted because he was his father’s favourite# al though perhaps unpalatable to the tribes or unfriendly in his feelings towards us. His renly was that in practice it would not be possible for the Ruler to anpoint an individ ual or for the latter to make good his success ion unless he enjoyed the confidence of the tribes and was capable of controlling them. As a mat*or of fact there being no third party to this Treaty the interpretation of it rests with us and we should not in practice accord recognition to anyone whom we did dis approve# nor would he be able to last# without-y' Article III. our recor^ni tlon.

In regard to this article however I would offer the following observations. In • iIn the British Dmaf^r the 'advice” referred to seems oily to roan advice in regard to the cession of territory dealt with in the article; but as it came in the Arabic# Bin Saud seemed to regard the undertaking as a general one* There are of course no stops in the Arabic# so that it is open to either con struction# and I would therefore suggest that in the English veriion# of which he has asked for a copy# we should have a full stop and new paragraph after the ^ords 'British GovernT'ent', This punctuation makes Bin baud’s undertaking not to cede without our consent# an absolute one# as I believe he traans it to be# and in addition gives us a general undertaking from him to follow our advice# when we find it ne cessary to give it Mr# unreservedly so long aa it is not damaging to his own interests. (15) The wording has been improved somewhat; the &amp; (13) meaning is the same as before. (17). Omission of words 'other Chiefs and tribes”• He said he had merely omitted these words as the several Chiefs whom we did nrotect and had relations with were all mentioned# so that the words in question seemed unnecessary; it was difficult to justify the retention of the words as providing for future requirements# without arguing possible cases in point.

P ol i t i c r. 1 Ag en t, 3 n h ra i ns * NOTE regarding interview with Bin Saud on ? 8 th December 1915. Shaikh of Kuwait on 31st December 1915. oooo With reference to recent reports from various sources, the following is the gist of the views expressed by Ibn Saud during mv meeting with bin on 26th December. It is true that he received a. slight flesh wound in the recent fighting with the Ajman, but it did not lay him up and is now quite healed. He expressed a much more colourless opinion regarding the reported activities of the Turks in Gen ral Arabia than that imparted by his late doctor to the Political Agent at Bahrain. He says there is no doubt that the urks are taking advantage of recent dovolopments in ~urope and the siispe ns lc of our advance towards Baghdad in order to endeavour to re kindle tribal and religious feeling against us, but he does not believe that there will be much result, and as far as Iraq is concerned is confident that some measure of unrest which at present prevails will subside as soon as we move on again. ith reference to the rumour of the intended purchase of forty thousand camels by the Turks, he states that the popula report is that they are required firstly for the transport of grain to Constantinople and then for military transport towar Egypt. He discredits these stories and believes the explana tion to be that the Turks are endeavouring to bribe tribal Ghaikhs generally to co-operate with then and find that the br^be is more easily digested if offered as an advance 'for investment in camels, or horses in case the Tovemnent should require them'. He says he received an overture in this form ifew months apo. He seems to have been somewhat exaggerating in his con versations with the Political Agent, Bahrain, before my ar rival and admits that he has no accurate news yet regarding the whereabouts of Ibn Rashid. He says that it is certain that he has moved 0 1 it of Rail, but how far, and whether to the west or east, he does not ^et know. As ho ever it would be a natural course for Pin Rashid to endeavour to harass him in Kasim, he has sent his brother on ahead to maintain vigilance in t^at quarter while he himself proceeds to his capital at Riyaz in order to be sure that unrest created by Turkish em issaries does not spread among his tribesmen. The letters which be intercepted in transit from Bin Rashid and A]aini to some of his disaffected relatives and the the Ainan Shaikhs do not amount to much and he does not really regard them seriously, his belief being that Ibn Rashid would not dare to advance too far skaxid either towards Kuwait or Nasiriyah for fear lest Bin Saud should cut in against Hail, in his rear. He believes that this tall talk will subside when we advance again, and bays that in any case the advance of n y large force at present is out of the question owing to the absence of rain and grazing. He thinks it is more probable that Bin Rashid will begin making overtures to him and if he does, he, Bin Saud, will offer to be reconciled with him on condition that he comes over to us or, failing that, agrees to remain absolutely neutral. If Bin Rashid will not accept either of these conditions, he, Bin Saud, will attack him and incite the Anaizeh to attack him also. In the event of our wanting him to co-operate actively in the direction of Basrah or Rasiriyah, Bin Saud says he could move up towards Kuwait and Zubair, but not towards Hasiriyah, as the grazing and watering places on that line are out of his tribal sphere and his action would arouse hostility. He recommends our making much of Hamud bin Suwait and the Ziiyid Shaikhs and employing@&gt; (g) employing thaa to hold the desert on the Nasiriyah side. As regards the Sheriff, he said his present relations with him were quite normal and friendly but that the Sheriff was essentially a trivial and unstable character and could never be depended upon. There was no truth in the former reports that the Sheriff's son had moved towards Hail with a large force to co-operate with Bin Has' id and he did not credit the present reports pointing to any active understanding between the Sheriff and Bin Rashid. As re gards the recent movement of Sheriff's son towards Kasim, he thought it was quite conceivable that havibg learnt that Bin Saud was having trouble with the Ajman the Sheriff had sent his son up to fish in troubled waters, but that in any case when the son reached Kasia he realised that Bin Saud was getting the better of the Ajman and abandoned any unneigh- bourly intentions which he may possibly have had. All he did was to punish a section of the Ataiba who had refused to pay Zakat and then return home. Sounded as to the general question of the Caliphate in the event of Turkey breaking up, he said his own view was that as far as the Ruling Chiefs of Arabia were concerned,no one cared in the least who called himself Caliph, and reminded me that the ahabis did not recognise any Caliph after the U*- first four. Asked if thought the Sheriff was likely to claim to become Caliph, he said he had no knowledge but that it was conceivable; but that in any case his kKixg calling him self Caliph would not make any difference to his status among other Chiefs and there would be no question of their accepting any control from him any more than they do now. Each individual Chief would continue, in his opinion, to control his own affairs and his own tribes as hitherto with this exception, please God, that they would in future be immune from Turkish oppression. He added that there was no doubt a certain amount of talk about the Caliphate in Cairo presumablypresumably because of the presence of a Sultan, but as far as the Jezirat-al-Arab was concerned, he did not consider that the question had any significance or interest for them. In speaking ad above, Bin Baud was no doubt inclined to think that his own point of view was the general one; but the opinions he expresses only bear out the general impression which we have gained on this side of Arabia since the begin ning of the war, viz, that the question of the Caliphate has no serious interest for the tribes or their Chiefs. At Sea, £7th December 1915. Lieut-Colonel Lat or . G)n 31st December I had a meeting with the Shaikh of Kuwait, Shaikh Jabar bin Mubarak, and in the course of conversa tion sounded him on the same subjects. As regards Bin Rashid he said his latest news was that he was still in Hail or close by; that it was most unlikely that he would rove in the direction of Kuwait or Zubair and that if he showed any/ intention of so doing, he, Shaikh Jab ar, would get news of it at once. He said that Bin Rashid was weak now. As regards the Ajman, who had taken refuge with his late father and been given M haz wa bakht” by him much to Bin Saud ? s annoyance, he said that he had already received a letter from Bin Saud (which he sent for and read out and which was couched in most cordial terms) explaining that he could not agree to the Ajman being forgiven, and asking him (Shaikh Jab ar) not to harbour them in or nea^t Kuwait; and that in pursuance of Bin Baud’s request, he had told the Ajman to clear out. According to him, the Ajman could muster about 2000 armed men, of whom pro bably 200 were mounted; and they would, no doubt, be thought, endeavour to get protection from Bin Rashid; but they were completely fcompletely broken for the present; their camels and horses quite work out and useless, and it would be two or three months at least before they were worth anything. Sounded, during conversation regarding the war, as to his opinion regarding the Caliphate in the event of Turkey breaking up, he evinced general ignorance of the subject, but was em phatic in the view that neither he nor his dependents had any interest whatever in the question. As for himself, all he was concerned with was his duty to the British Government to whom he and his father owed so much, and the good administration of his territory. December 31st 1915.

All connection between Koweit and those parties of the Ajman tribe which have joined Ajaimi and the Abdah section of the Shamrnar ceased some weeks ago, and they are now allowed neither to come to Koweit nor to obtain supplies from thence. These prohibitions date from the day on which we heard that they had taken the course stated, and as they have since plundered some Koweit camels in Koweit territory an additional reason for enmity has occurred. No agreement between them and Shaikh Jabir is therefore in existence; they are now regarded as his enemies and ours.

Dr: Van VlacX ^ives me tae following information received from Shaikns Dhari and Abdur Razaq, ban! Rashid, who had been patients in the Mission hospital and accon- •pa&amp;led him and A.s.Hudson to Hoffuf : - The presents from the Sharif of Mecca to Bin Baud included two swords and nine daggers in gold sheaths, and several rifles in addition to the already reported. These presents were ostensibly in return for assistance rendered by Bin Baud in arranging for certain Bhalfchs to desist from raids on the Medina railway. The were, however, really given on behalf of the Turkish Government. Both Dhari and Abdur Razaq showed Dr (3 Van Vlack letters received from Qasim about the expedition of Turk!, Bin Baud’s son, and Faisal bin Rashid which was mentioned in the enclosure to my letter 26.0. of the 24th: instant. -They state that, despairing of effecting anythin in Central Arabia while Bin Baud and bin Rashid ara at loggerheads, the Turks are now arranging directly with Bln Baud to back him up against one of the fresh factions among the Bani Rashid. They do not know yet whether Bin Baud will side with Baud bin Abdul Aziz or Baud as Baleh, but they seem to expect one of the periodical holocausts in hlch the Banl Rashid Indulge, and are certain that, whoever Bin Baud backs, they will core into th ir own. Both of these menare bitterly opposed to tde present regime in Jabal snamnar, out ShaiKU Cnarl Is at heart a pro-Turk. I do not think AMur Razaq has any affection for the Turk, and ho and his half brother, Faisal, who was with Bin Saud at Qatif, and is his most trusted leader in the field, are aooa ently out in their own interests.. 2. Shaikh Abdullah bin ^asim informs me that Bin Saud has accepted Salman al Araif^s submission, and that tfc latter will shortly arrive in Bahrain en route to Riadh. 3. Bin Baud*s gunners have arrived, and will be be sent to Basrah by the first ship. Bln Saud asks that the rifles may be sent at once if the gunners’ training is to last any tine; but, if they are to stay only a few days in Basrah, he says they may bring the rifles with them. 4.

' Now that I am writing I may as well give you the news of the war up to date* Tou will have heard of the fall of Kut* The garrison had come to the end of their food and were dying of starvation, while owing to the excessive floods our force could not reach them in time so it became inevitable for them to surrender after absolutely destroying their gun* and aixminitlon* *t is of course a great regret to us that 3000 Englishmen and 6000 British Indians, all on the point of death from starvation should have fallen into the hands of the Turks | but the matter is of no military importance* There was no big battle, because the flooc made it impossible) and our forces still confront the enemy near Es Slim - and as soon as the floods subside they will move on again* Do not be misled by the fantastic stories which the * TurksTurks are spreading, alleging that they hare captured 30,000 non and a lor^e number of guns* It ia all liee, and the facts are that they got a number of half starved prisoners and no guns udiatever* On the side of Armenia the Russians have long ago captured Erzeroura, Tribiaond, Bitlis and ErSindjan and are now near Diarbekir • Sirrllarly they are in occupation of Qajsr-i- Shirln and approaching Klianikin and the TurTrs are obliged to withdraw troops from Ira«x to send them towards KhanilriLn# Do not therefore believe reports of their sending anything towards the Euphrates! before long you iid.ll see that the TurJo® are heraned in by the Russians on the north and us in the south* C.P.0 #L ?jra;a from Sir Percy Cox, Basrah, No 232Q, dated 18th Ma; 181 E-.i Rashid has been behaving in an equivocal manner for some time. On the one hand asking for access to our markers, and on the other ignoring communication® from me and approaching inconveniently close to Khamielyeh* He probably will not commit himself tc active hostility but in view of his altitude he is aing informed that he will no longer be permitted access to pot is. We recently heard that there had been a skirmish between Kuwait ' 3outs and Bin Rashid, now we hear that overtures of peace are on foot between Kuwait and Bin Rashid and that Salim Bin kubarak has sent Bin Rashid two hundred sacks of flour. Please tegraph what position is: Shaikh of Kuwait should on no account enter into friendly relations without full consultation with us. Cox. Reply dated 22nd May, sent by launch to Fao. Your 2326. Position here quite satisfactory. Skirmish was be tween Umm Tair and Ajman raiding parties. No truth in rumour of peace overtures or presents having been given of flour or other articles. We heard on 15th inst that Bin Rashid had received se venty thousand rupees from you and was behaving satisfactorily which news caused some surprise. You are advised not to trust Bin Suwalt too much who is believed fcehere to be playing for him self regardless of consequences. Grey.No C 43 of 1S16 Political Agency, Kuwait May 23rd 1016, To The Chief Political Officer Baar&amp;h, I I have the honour to refer to my telegram of 22nd inst, and pre vious correspondence , regarding Bln Rashid. My telegram was despatched somewhat hastily to catch a launch. Bin Rashid did recently attempt to establish friendly relations with Kuwait, but nothing came of his endeavours. He employed Kana* bin Sumit who wrote stating that Bin Rashid desired to be friendly, and Shaikh Jabir replied that if Bln Rashid wished for peace he could have it by not molesting him, but that if he wish ed for war he was ready for him. This admirable reply met with no further advances. K.E. Shaikh Jabir and our other particular friends here have no confidence in Hamud bln Suwait, and they think that Bin Rashid is merely sending on your letters to the Turks to shew his im portance, and they do not think that he will give any return for the favours we have shewn him. These questions are the sub ject of frequent discussions between the Shaikh and me, and he undertakes to act in accordance with the concluding sentence of your telegram No 2326. At the moment of writing news has just arrived that the Ajm&amp;n have captured near Samhan one hundred camels, the property of one of the ( Nejdi ) Bassam which were on their way to Kuwait.

Abdulla. I explained to him at length that Sheikh Ibrahim had nothing to do with it* that he was entirely in the hands of &lt;Government in the matter and that the reason for the rejection of the caravan was his neglect to answer the letters from Govomroent and their consequent doubt as to Ills being a friend or an enemy. I said! If you wrote to Bln Baud ami he took no notice would not you tliink it strange? Amir- I should certainly be offendod- Abdulla.

Chief Political officer#f Demi-Official letter to C.P.O. dated 19th June, 4916. I have no time to write officially, but this is to say that in reply to Jabi^s letter which I read to you and left transla tion behind with my memo No C51 Bin Rashid replied briefly sending two men whom he said would explain everything. Nothing however can be got out of them but expressions of friendship, and so Jablr has sent two of his men back with them to inter view Bin Rashid on his behalf and give him good advice: inci dentally they will see for themselves what Bin Rashid's posi tion is. Jabir and Salim called on me this afternoon and asked whether I approved of this to which I had no objection. They have no intention of departing from unity of purpose with us, and the messengers will explain this to Bin Rashid. We hear that the latter has retired to Chaibda en route to Shagra. An official letter will follow. t mWo .£ f tof 1916. Polit,ioal Agenoy, Kuwait. The 23rd June 1916. To The Chief Polioioal Officer, Basrah. Memorandum. I have the honour to submit a translation of the reply of Bin xteshid to the letter of Shaikh ^abir which formed an enclosure to my memo No. C-51 dated loth instant, and of a further letter which has been written from Kuwait. Shaikh Jabir with his brother Salim called upon me on the 19t instant for advice prior to the despatch of the latter communicati -tion and its contents were discussed at some length. The Shaikh assured me again and again that he had no intention of deviating from our policy, that his object in sending men was to impress ^ upon Bin Rashid not only that he and His Majesty's Government are one^but that the Turks are worthy of no confidence or reliance, and that his best course is to leave them and follow your guid- -anoe. Shaikh dabir having assured me that in no circumstances would Bin Rashid be allowed access to Kuwait or leave to provi- -sion here I samd that his messengers might go. We have since heard that Bin Rashid has attacked and plunder- -ed the outskirts of 2iubair and the return of the messengers is believed to be imminent.

Your servants tell us that you desire our friendship. The matter between us is a long one and is not ao- -oording to the former state: it requires elujidation and import- -ant conditions between us (have to be made). As my object is of eo much importance I am sending you Nahar Bu Safrah and Hamad Ash Shawaiir who will inform you of all that is in my mind and you also (will inform) and salaam. Reply of Shaikh Jabir dated After compliments, Your letter has arrived and also Nahar Bu Safrah and Hamad Ash Shawaiir who you said would explain all to us. We got nothing out of them however but expressions of friendship: that mutual affection is your object: and that we should send you men from here.

As requested in your memo No. 6666 dated July 27th I forward herewith copies with translations of Bin Rashid's lette: of 26th Shabaan (27th June) to rhaikh Jahir and of the latter's reply thereto. I am afraid there can be little doubt that Shaikh Jabir is a weak ruler. But I believe hie sympathies to be genuinely and entirely with us, though in negooiating a separate truce with Ibn Rashid his action was far from being correct. It must be remembered however that Ibn iiashid was in the vicinity of Kuwait, angry at having been refused access and that he was able to do a good deal of damage to the tribes protected by Kuwait. It seems that there was a veritable panic in the town as an attack was expected and pressure was no doubt brought to bear on the Shaikh from all quarters to come to some arrangement with ibn Rashid.

You are aware that all goods which arrive here do not bear the port mark of Nejd but are clearly addressed to Kuwait merchants. Nejd people come and buy goods from Kuwait merchants and most of them take and sell them on commission. This method of business is in existence now from time immemorial and no shipments have up to date arrived here for Nejd. This can be proved by a reference to the manifests of steamers. It is therefore impossible for me to make any change in my usual customs duty which is being levied from olden times. In case transhipment of goods is allowed it will interfere with my sw revenue and I shall be a great loser on all sides. Doe this reason I cannot make any change nor see a way to permit transhipment of goods here. If Bin Saud now wishes to help his merchants then he has his own sea ports. I shall feel much obliged if you will kindly explain the matter to Sir Percy Cox and convey my salaams to him. I trust that we shall always be looked upon as old friends and subjects.Polluioal Acenoy, Kuwait. The 20th July 1916. To (1) . The Chief Political Officer, Basrah. (2) .

Meiaoranduifl I have the honour to refer to your nemoranuun No.5394 dated June 26th 1916 acquainting ne with the purport of a letter froi Bin Baud regarding ou;ton;s imposts levied by the riuler'of Kuwait on goods destined for Nejd. Information io called for as to the pretent practice and I ara requested to asoertain to v/hat extent the f-haPdi of Kuvrait feels able to meet Bin Baud's wi-hes. The following is the result of my enquiries into the first of taeoe propositions The Shaikh ohorges a duty of 4 per cent on all goods imported inso Kuwait excepting a few articles of luxury on which 10 per cent is levied. It was in contemplation to charge a further 4 per cent on re-export but the old tariff which works out con .iderable le:&gt;s than 4 per cent has been adhered to: it is as follows Coffee ~ # 2 per camel load of bags. Sugar - $ 1 per camel load of 2 bags. Rice - free. Piece-goods - 2 per camel load of 2 bales or bundlei Iron ware - # 1 per camel load. Kero &lt;ene oil - # 1 per camel load of 6 oases. Hitherto no goods have arrived here m/irked specially for transhipment to Nejd but as Kuwait is chiefly a clearing house for the states of the interior a considerable pro- -portion of these goods mu it eventually find it„ 3 way to Bin Baud 1 a oountry.I Bounded o’ae Shaiidi in aooord&amp;noe with youi' in .t^motionc.

All this stuff has broken bulk and perhaps changed hands since its arrival at thi: port in single consignments of cargo. It would be impossible ther* -after to grant a rebate to tue merchants who nad already paid import duty. The re-export tariff is very light and thei*e is this to be said in ito favour that the foreigner is thereby made to oontribut more /in proportion to the Shaikh* coffers than the latter’s subjects. For, if it were abolished it would become necessary in order to cave lora of income, to raise the import dues above the present very low rate. .j am aware that prices have been ruinoucly high in the in- -terior recently. 'That is due to a variety of causes but the low rate of customs duties levied by the Shaikh cf Kuwait cannot pos- -sibly be one of them.

FRE.I From Abdul Aziz ibn Abdur Rahman al Faisal In the Name of God the Merciful To - The Chief Political Officer Dated the 15th Aurrust 1915* After Compliments* I despatched a letter to Your Honour recently; Inshallah you duly received it and it found you in the best of health* It is some little time since I received any letter from Your Honour com municating to me the ptood news of your victories over the evil do ers. I am always waiting for your good news in that connection. After writing my previous letter to you, I received from the Sherif of Mecca letters conveying the good news of his occupation of Mecca with the assistance of your guns* He asked me to|r 0 nder him assistance and to unite myself with him. I have written back saying that as regards assistance I will not fail to render it to the utmost of my power. As to union with him I have remarked that I have no designs on his country, i*e. the Hed.laz and its surroundings: whereas, on the other hand, he, in the past, has been in the habit of interfering with my tribes and my territory, alleging that this has been done at the instance of the Turks and that it was they who were prompting him to do so. I contended that if he meant to be sincere and desired to be united with me and that we should work hand in hand, he should give me an under taking and a solemn promise for the immunity of my terrirories and my subjects, and for abstention from trespassing in our limits^ or from interference with our subjects. If this reply is in the affirmative and he acts loyally, no effort on my part will, please (jod, be spared to help him to the best of my ability. My motive in replying as above is not due to anv desire on my part to ally myself with him, for you are aware of his previous relations with me: but it was duo, firstly, to tne faco of my al liance with yourselves, and secondly, to my hatred of the Turks.I am anxious to further anything that may assist to expel them* So, if he answers in the affirmative and assures me that he has no aim other than real friendship, well anti £ood* If he is seeking 9 to impose on me so that ho may achieve his own independence and render nimself free to start his old interference with me, then the matter is merely one between him and me and I shall look after myself to the best of my ability* But, if on the contrary, the matter concerns your Great Government, I should, in that case, like to do whatever is convenient to you* I have therefore re~ ferred the matter to you* In a^v case the Sheriff's boundaries and territories are well known; and a further reference will bo made to you, Inshallah, when I receive his reply* I also have to inform Your Honour that I have recently learnt that the Adrian, who was lately toith Ibn Kashid in the neighbourhood of Zubair, had, on account of the peace between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Subah, come to an understanding with both those Chiefs, soon after the departure of Ibn Rashid from the neighbourhood of his oontaot with Ibn Twala and Ibn Swait, to the effect that they should settle in the territories of Ibn Subah* This is not as it should be • I have explained to ^our Honour regarding the A.lnan and their attitude towards me. They are outlaw subjects of mine and the reason of their contumacy was their support by Ibn Subah and their stay at Koweit, and this will certainly cause friction between me ana Ibn Subah, for my subjects are bound to pursue the feud with the Ajman and so am I o I have also sent my representative, Abdul Aziz al Rabai, with letters to Ibn Subah and have made the necessary communi cation to him regarding matters at issue between him and me* I have also instructed my representative aforesaid that if Ibn Subah responds to our advice and complies with my wishes, so much the more gratifying will it be to me, and I shall regard them as the best of friends and fellow-tribesmen* If, however. hehe rejects my advice, my messenger has been instructed to refer to your Consul at Koweit; and then, if possible, he will proceed to Basrah to lay the matters before you* But in truth I have said more than enough on this subject. You will understand that did matters concern him and me alone, we should come to issue in regard to differences of loss importance than this; but as your Government is also interested, I am/willing that there should be any differences between us. People, however, in these days, while they fail to abide by their friendships or to sticfe to their friends, do not hesitate tox^act contrary to the principles of religion and good sense. But it is certain that there are matters from which no advantage is to be gained by interference with them. Owing, however, to my regard and friendship for Your Honour, I do not do anything without communicating with you, and I will act with circumspection. I depend on you in this matter and beg for guidance from God, and thence from you. I trust your friend ship with me will be perpetual and hope that I shall receive news of your good health without any intermission, and trust you will acquaint me with the good news of the victories of your armies.

If his letter of 27th June were taken specific exception to he would merely excuse himself by saying he had showed the draft to P.A. In this connect!on,with reference to your letter of 30th June,I would observe that Shaikh Jabar’s letter cannot fairly be regarded as only a formal and polite acknowledg ment; it is the definite conclusion of a compact with a Chief who at that moment was a professed Turkish Subject^ and therefore an enemy of the allies. Shaikh Jttbar when he was here a few days ago was profuse,in presence of Shaikh inahommerah.in his professions of loyalty and desire to be given orders and to obey them implicitly. In accepting his professions as sincere,as I do, I and Shaikh Khasaal told him (without specific reference to his subject) that it was of the highest importance that he should consult you before acting and not after doing so. I think we must leave it at this and recognise that we have got a weak timid but well meaning ruler to deal with * whom we cannot leave to his own devices as we did Shaikh kubarak. It puts the greater responsibility on the P.A to achieve such an influence over Shaikh Jabir that he will gradually acquire the habit of coming to consult his P.A in §TPMtftlfttjUm of m lottor fron AM El~Assls ttm AM tv&amp; r -'th aI--'•.■■ ifia^to ?^ '-ormw :'ir 'nrcy 'o-, ’1« pfnjof?tv f a Co*i0i*l Oononil in tiio Anir• In tlio nisme of OM tha Morcifnl# Aftor ymm .Mriand haa tho ho^ioiir to roc^lve yonr ootocr^otl lot tor aiyi imdorfitootl tho oontante* neferring atmelflcally to wfrat you wrote?

Information was brought from an incoming Hejd ca- -ravan that shortly before leaving Dora^dah a Turkish Mission from Damasju.i and Medina had arriveu in the vicinity of that place. It was composed of two “effendis M and one •'Sharif* (I could get no particulars about t.ie effendis or who the sharif was but the latter may be a religious parsonage) . They had with theo 30 or 40 camels which are believed to be laden with presents of mmey and arms for Bin Aaud. Mulla Salih, the Sheikh’s Secretari who came to ae with the news, said he thought the mission was by way of a reply to a letter sent to the Turks by Bin Saud by hand of his envoy faladi remonstrating with the Turks for supplying Bin iiaohid with money and arms in order to attack him. Palaui, so Mulla Halih thinks, may have taken with him a letter from Ibn paraon written previously to his arrest, recommending Bin Saud for his good rreaumenm of him! Mulla Salih t jld me that he was dining x,o nigho with Abdal- -lah al Nafasi, Bin Sauf's agent:, and would inform him that, we were aware of the facts regarding the Turkish micsion. Mulla Salih suggested that you might telegraph to Bin Saud ana ask him in the name of our friendship to let you know what the object and idea of the mission is. I jonclude there is no doubt as to the oorreotmens of this information. It was some uime in September that news reached here of Bin Baud's communicating wrtn the Turks (see Kuwait news September 1.3th) f we now get the name of the envoy and an idea of the contents of Bin Baud's communication. Sinoe then however Bin Saud has defined nis attitude and irretrievably committed himselfCopy of ^ translation^dated 26th December 1916 from Sheikh h£ El Zobeir Ibrahim El Abdulla to D.C.P.O. After salams and asking about your health.May you be preserved. We beg to inform you that we have heard last night that two honourable men and two officers with two servants and twenty Turkish soldiers have arrived at the town called Ibreelah in Nejd Quaseem district. They are coming from Medinah at Hejaz and they want to speak to tsin Saud about the camels he has taken from sen Faron and also about his prevent ing the people of Najd from going to Medinah. Their idea is to meet him (tsin Saud) at Hassa because hin Saud is no* at Hassa. This news as it appears is confirmed. This is what we wantsay.

I donot, for a moment, wish to presume that my reading of the events is the correct one. I only give you the conclusions 1 have arrived at from close communication with Arabs of Ever description in Bahrein. I mention one significant fact. To get news of Nejd and affairs of Central Arabia here is like getting water out of a stone. Every person seems interested in preventing one getting hold of the most ordinary news. Bin Baud, for one, does not like any news to reach me, unless it comes from himself direct. It is rather natural.

They are without discipline and are for ever wanting to stray from the right path* They would be the first to squeal if a powerful neigh bour were a menace to them* At present they all know well that with a strong din Masohid, din daud would think twice before send ing a large force any distance from Nejd* They feel,like the fox, that they are safe in treading on the tail of the lion* They know they are fairly safe from reprisals * The coastal states, therefore, will always welcome, more than any thing, an indecisive and wasting war between bin baud and din naschid* The i\rab way is to exist by putting hia powerful neighbours against each other. At the same time, if he cannot do this, he must have a strong protect ing power to fall back on# Mhould bin baud be all powerful in Arabia, then british influence will enormously increase among the coastal states* Were bln baud and bin due chid to carry on an in definitely prolonged war whereby both were badly weakened, the first result would be seen in a tendency to throw off british in fluence and interfex'ence^among Coastal states* It should not be forgotten also that all these small Coastal states are ambitious to increase their territories inland, dmikh Abdullah*bin ihaikh out of the bag Isa the Huler of bohrein, recently lat the o^t(9) (i&amp;i) neatly ae regards iJahrein* In private oonversation, he bewailed the fact that the Turks had not been in possession of Haasa, as they had been of the Hejaz at the beginning of the Great War* For then, he said, Bahrein would have obtained help from the i&amp;igliah and overrun the whole of Hassa and become master of the isastera seaboard, from Koweit to Trucial Oman ( Abu Dhabi)* I happened to remark ' //hat about din daud, and the finlerjf of ^atar' * '0h, w said he,'With your troops behind us they wouldnt have counted, ^atar would have become ours atonoe, while we would have forced you into declaring war with Bin Baud and his cursed Ikhwan' • ' The people of Ha8sa',he went on to say, 'Would have acclaimed dhaikh Isa as King; and in any case would far rather have had dhaikh Isa than Bin daud'* Of course if His Majesty's Government really did want to help Bin daud become all powerful, and wished definitely to aid him in bringing Bin Kaschid under his power, the quickest and easiest method to this end would be fot it to declare a strict blockade against Bin Kasohid from Nejef, in Iraq, down to Koweit, both towns inclusive* The Koweit blockade to be in hands of British officials* This combined with a threat of war with from Bin daud would, within three months, compel Bin Raaohid to accept any terms imposed on him* Koweit, however, for blockade purposes, would have to be temporarily taken over by British* A local blockade run by dheikh dalem would be a farce* If, on the other hand, a strong , Bin Raschid is essential to His Majesty's Government's policy, then the only thing to do is to back Bin daud steadily in the same way that the Turks continuously backed Bin Rasohid* In any oase Coastal states should always be made to live in a state of fear of the big Hejd neighbour, for only in this way will they desire to live on good terms with the British. They must feel the necessity of our protection* They will get out of hand,otherwise* (9) In reviewing the above situation and trying to foresee what course Bin daud is likely to adopt in dealing with dhammar, one must not forget Syria* Events there are moving fast. Are the anazah tribes too taken up with Faisal to want to meddle with Jauf affairs^?

The n-ao(II) P erf id© iilbion* was juat as commonly used in Staoboul before the it war, aa ever/was in Paris* as I said above, a British Officer visiting Riyadh next autton, say Novembor next, would givs Bin Baud an opportunity of getting mueli off his chest* I am convinced my viiit lust February to Hoffuf resulted in bringing much peace of mind to Bin Baud* l managed to leave the impression, I think, in Bin oaud’s mind that, at any rate, in Bahrein he had one to champ ion him* The visit waa equally valuable from His Majesty*s Govt , s point of view* as I mentioned at the time. Bin Baud wants some one to talk to, and some one whom he knows will convey all he has to say to higher authorities* a British Officer, with possibly two others, should be sent each cold weather if possible, not an Indian Mussulman again* The bigger the man, the mors Bin Baud will feel honoured* ‘The mere presence of such a mission in Riyadh will do more than anything else to advertise the fact to the people of x.rabia that His Majesty , s Government is on the best of terms with the Ruler of Nejd, and means to support him* This is what Bin Baud wants* iis he puts it ' Jiddam al ‘Arab arid al hakumah taka,b±nxL' (before the Arabs I want the Government to make me big) According to Abdul ^zlz al ^usaibi. Bin Baud is not afraid the in the very least of any direct action on the part of/ Koweit, Bin Aaachid, Hejaz oombination.
