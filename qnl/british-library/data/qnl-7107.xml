Revised to 5th March 1934. India Office, P.Z. 614/34. Memo. B. 430. The Southern Boundary of Qatar and the Connected Problems. The question for settlement is that of the boundaries of the Sheikhdom of Qatar where it is not bounded by the sea. In the pre-war period the boundary to the south was to some extent indeterminate, but broadly speaking was regarded at the time of the compilation of Lorimer's Gazetteer in 1905-07 as running across the base of the Lor - ^ Qatar Peninsula more or less south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point north of lo06 ' Khor-al- Odeid. There is reason to believe that the Sheikh of Qatar still regards it as following approximately this line (see paragraph 8 below), but conditions have not been piopitious for raising the question specifically with, him, and the present note aims at reaching a provisional conclusion on the material available as to— (a) the southern boundary of Qatar ; (h) il the boundaries of Qatar on the south and west do not extend to the blue line agreed as the eastern frontier of Nejd in the unratified Anglo-Turkish ( onvention of 'Tuly 1913, the position of the interveuing area. The history of the question is as follows ;— The Boundary on the South-East. 2. To the east, the boundary between Qatar and the adjoining Trucial Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi has been the subject of frequent dispute in the past. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has claimed sovereignty over a stretch of Qatar territory running so far Lor. II 405. north as the Bay of Lmm-al-Hul, south of A\ akra ou the map attached.' The Sheikh of Qatar, for his part, has claimed sovereignty over areas in the Abu Dhabi Sheikhdoni running as far east as the Sabakhat Matti. His Majesty's Government Lor. 11, 88- liave consistently refused to recognise claims so exaggerated by either partv but thev 8S, ■ have repeatedly intimated that they regard the Khor-al-'Odeid, which lies about mid way between the extreme points referred to, as appertaining to Abu Dhabi. Thev have tor it so also recognised the Abu Dhabi claim to the district of Aqal, geographical details of ' ' ' which are given m I (ni) of the Appendix to this note, and which contains both the khoi-al ( ueid and the Ivhor-adli-Dhuwaihin. We have thus a fixed point for the south-eastern boundary of Qatar. The Boundary on the South-West. 3. On the south-western extremity of the Qatar boundary there has been no corresponding dispute, nor is there a fixed point equally definitely established which can with confidence be regarded as marking the western limit of the territories of Qatar. The Position prior to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. fw- 6 ® out ^ ern boundary of Qatar was closely investigated locally between 1904 and 190/ by experienced political officers in connection with the 'compilation of Mr. Lonmers 1 ersian Gulf Gazetteer.' The result of their investigation is fdven in the extract from the Gazetteer reproduced as item I (i) in the Appendix to this note, liroadly speaking, it went to show that the southern boundary of the State ran south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to the north of the Khor-al-Odeid Over the first section, running Irom Dohat-as-Salwa to the Wells of Sakak there was no depute. The boundary between the Wells of Sakak and the sea on the eastern side oi the Qatar Peninsula was, however, indeterminate. Two alternatives (the difference at its widest point being some 20 miles) were reported by Lorimer For the reasons given by him (and substantially based on the historical considerations 'm 'tt . 0 '' Pfuagrapli 2 above) he regarded the second alternative as preferable. L he effect of its acceptance would be that the eastern sector of the southern Oatar boundary wouid run south-east from the Wells of Sakak to the sea north of the Khor-al- Udeid. * Not reproduced. 2560 75 9.342 The Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913. 5. Discussion over the years 1911-13 between the Turkish Government and His Majesty's Government on the various matters in dispute between them in the Persian Gulf area culminated in the latter year in the signature of two Conventions defining inter alia the eastern limits of Turkish authority in Arabia. Fhe Convention of 29th July 1913, which defined the eastern boundary of Nejd, is alone relevant for the present purpose. Under that Convention, which, though reference is made to it in the ratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 9th March 1914, was never itself ratified, the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjaq of Nejd was defined by a bine line on the map running due south from the head of the bay opposite Zaqnuniyeh Island in the Persian Gulf to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Central Arabian Desert. The text of the relevant article is given in section 11 of the Appendix attached to this Note. Its wording (' une ligne . . . separera le Nedjd de la presqu'ile d'El Katr. Les limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue . . . ') would justify the contention that the blue line was at once the eastern frontier of Nejd and the western frontier of Qatar. But there are definite objections to adopting this view. In the first place, there is nothing to show that this was, in fact, the intention of His Majesty's Government at the time when the Convention was concluded, or that they had any object beyond limiting the eastern boundary of the Turkish possessions in this area. Secondly, there is no evidence of any claim to suzerainty by Qatar so far P.Z. 299/34. to the west or so far to the south. Thirdly, the Resident's telegram of 11th January 1934, T. 19, emphasises the absence of control by the Sheikh of Qatar over the interior of his State (and a fortiori over regions so remote from Dohah as are now under consideration). Fourthly (though this by itself is probably not of serious importancej the position vis-a-vis Ibn Sand is to some extent compromised, as explained below, at any rate as regards the Barr-al-Qarah, by the line fixed by Sir Percy Cox in 1922. Fifthly, it is arguable that even in a formal document such as the 1913 Convention, the fact that the blue line is spoken of separating Nejd from the Qatar Peninsula, need not be regarded as determining the boundary of Qatar. The Qatar Peninsula was the closest prominent geographical feature and the nearest adjoining Arab political entity on the mainland, and a reference to it for descriptive purposes was not unnatural. Finally, there is much to be said for giving no avoidable extensions to the boundaries of Qatar, even if the consequence is that we have to deal with an area of indeterminate ownership between those boundaries and the blue line. Line indicated in 1922 by Sir P. Cox to Ibn Saud and Major Holmes as the Eastern Limit of any Oil Concession in respect of Hasa. 6. One more incident of importance should be recorded before coming to the latest evidence as to the view held by the Sheikh of Qatar as to his southern boundary. The incident is that referred to in Colonel Dickson's letter of 4th July 1933, No. 143, to the Political Resident, copies of which were received under the Political Resident's express letter of 18th December 1933, No. 1934 S., when Sir P.Z. 180/34 Percy Cox, who was then High Commissioner for Iraq, in a discussion at Oqairin 19-JJ with Ibn Saud, then Sultan of Nejd, and Major Holmes, warned both the Sultan and Major Holmes that the Sultan could grant no concession, and Major Holmes receive none from him, in respect of the Principality of Qatar, and drew on a map a line running from Djau-ed-Dukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, he indicated, must represent the eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in respect of Hasa. Such a line, as will be seen from the map, excludes the whole Qatar Peninsula (and incidentally a substantial area lying to the west of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention). It also includes in Hasa an area to the east ol the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention. It should, however, be noted that while it constituted a definite indication of the High Commissioner's view as to the eastern boundary of Hasa, it in no way specifically defined the boundaries of Qatar save in so far as Qatar might be regarded as marching with Hasa and Nejd, or might be regarded as having been granted a western frontier bounded by the blue line of the 1913 Convention at the time when that Convention was concluded.' 5 Busliire 7. The statement reported in Bushire Memorandum No. 947 S. of 20th December Memo. 947S. 1922 to have been made by Sir P. Cox that Ibn Saud had agreed with Sir P. Cox, in 1922, that the boundary line between Nejd and Qatar should follow a line running P.Z. 464/ ^ lie south from the end of the bay south of Bahrein Island and just east of Mabak as t Sir Percy Cox's comments on this incident are contained in the Note dated 27th February 1934, printed as Appendix IV to this Memorandum.© 3 shown on FrciS6r -Hiint6r's injip, stands by itsBlf, tis such 3,11 aircin^GinGnt \\cis tic\ti apparently recorderl m writing by the two parties or officially confirmed. Such a line would, of course, he c^mte inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line. It would equally give a very substantial extension to the boundaries of Qatar an extension of much more practical importance now than m 1922, when t.heie ^as no question of active exploitation of the hinterland, and our concern vyas chiefly to maintain the independence of the sheikhdoms of the Arab littoral against Tbn Sand. The statement is, no doubt, an alternative version of Sir P. Cox's warning to Ibn Saud as to the eastern boundary of any concession to be granted by him in respect of Hasa discussed in the preceding paragraph, of which an authoritative record based on personal knowledge is given in Colonel Dickson's letter of 4th July 1933, Ko. 143. l.P.C. Map of February-March 1933. 8. The map compiled by the l.P.C. geologists during their survey in Qatar in February-March 1933 marks a southern boundary line starting on the sea-coast immediately south of Jabul-el-Naksh about 10 miles north of Salwa town and 12 miles north of the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, turning abruptly to the south- south -east immediately south-east of Jabul-el-Naksh for a distance of some 12 miles to Qalat-ali-Bin-Said, and thence running due east, leaving Tuair-al-Hamir on its left, through the Wadi-al-Ghurban to the sea, which it apparently reaches at a point some 8 miles north of the outlet of the Khor-al-'Odeid inlet and not very far into the Naqiyan Sandhills, The A.P.O.C., in communicating a copy of this map, remarked : ' The dotted line P.Z. 456/34. boundary to the south of Qatar is apparently the Sheikh's version of the line. The l.P.C. report, however, is not definite about this.' The A.P.O.C. have since reported that, according to one member (Haji A. F. Williamson) of the geological party which visited Qatar in February and March 1933, the southern boundary shown on their map was indicated by the Sheikh himself. If the line in fact represents his view, the boundary, as will be seen, will correspond very closely to the pre-war line recorded by Lorimer. Conclusions as to the Southern Boundary of Qatar. 9. It is suggested, in the light of the evidence collected above — (а) that the south-eastern boundary of Qatar must lie to the north of the Khor-al-'Odeid and the district of 'Aqal ; (б) that while His Majesty's (government had at no stage formally recognised any specific southern boundary to Qatar (save to the extent referred to in (a)), such evidence as is available goes to show that the pre-war boundary ran roughly south-east across the base of the Peninsula, from Dohat-as-Salwa, or a point slightly north of it, to a point north of the Khor-al-'Odeid. There is no recorded evidence of any more extensive claims by the Sheikh of Qatar other than those to Abu Dhabi territory referred to in paragraph 2 above ; (c) in the light of the above, that, if it proves that the Sheikh of Qatar now regards the line shown on the l.P.C. map as his southern boundary, this may be accepted by His Majesty's Government as generally satisfactory. Acceptance of that line, if we continue to regard the blue line of the 1913 Convention as the eastern boundary of Ibn Saud's territories (or even if we were to agree to the attribution of the Barr-al Qarah district lying east of the blue line to Hasa (see paragraph 18 below)), will admittedly leave an area of undetermined ownership between Qatar and Nejd. The problems involved in this are discussed in greater detail in paragraphs 10 and following. If, however, His Majesty's Government are prepared to face them, the boundary in question has the merits that it is consistent with the obligations we have undertaken to Abu Dhabi; it is equally consistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the 1913 Convention as against Ibn Saud (or with such a modifi cation of that line as is referred to in paragraph 19 (c) (i) below; and it has the advantage of definitely limiting the area of any commitments in respect of protection, &amp;c., into which His Majesty's Government may think it desirable to enter in the event of an oil concession being granted by the Sheikh.4 Position of Area lying between Base of Qatar Peninsula and Blue Line of Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 10. If, in these circumstances, it is accepted that the southern boundary of Qatar should be a line running via or to the north of Sakak more or less south-east from I)ohat-as-Salwa or a point slightly to the north of Dohat-as-Salvva to a point to the north of the Khor-al-'Odeid, the difficult question arises of the position of the country lying between such a line and the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 'Importance of Maintaining the Blue Line. 11. On the one hand, it appears definitely important if possible to maintain the blue line laid down in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as against Ibn Saud or any other future ruler of this part of Arabia. While the 1913 Convention was never ratified, the blue line at any rate represents the agreement reached at the time between Turkey and His Majesty's Government as to the limits of Turkish authority in northern Arabia and on the Persian Gulf, and in dealing with Ibn Saud as the successor in title to the Turks we can, it would seem, not unreasonably take our stand on it. The difficulties of finding any satisfactory substitute are patent. The undesirability of giving Ibn Saud, in the absence of any definite eastern boundary to his territories, an excuse for territorial expansion (as distinct from the exercise, as at present, of an informal influence and the receipt from our Arab clients of payments which we do not recognise and the existence of which we ignore) in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and of Muscat is equally clear. Such expansion would clearly involve a risk either of his coming into conflict with the local rulers, whose treaty relations with His Majesty's Government he has formally lecognised, or of his establishing an influence in the Sheikhdoms in question so powerful as to be embarrassing from our point of view. Disadvantages of Maintenance of the Blue Line while fixing Southern Boundary of Qatar at the Base of the Qatar Peninsula. 12. At the same time, important on general grounds, for the reasons given, as the maintenance of the blue line appears to be, the fact must be faced that in the present case, if we continue to regard it as the eastern boundary of Ibn Saud's territory, and if, as suggested, we accept a southern boundary ior Qatar running roughly across the base of the Qatar Peninsula, a not inconsiderable area lying between the two States, and peopled by migratory Bedouin tribes, will be left in an indeterminate political position. There is a possibility that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who has in the past exercised a wide influence, and made tribal alliances of his own, in the Trucial hinterland—c/. Sir P. Cox's letter No. 176 of 28th June 1904—might prefer some claim to such an area. But, though on this point further information will be sought from the Resident, there seems little evidence of any active interest on the part of Ahu Dhabi in any area to the west of 'Aqal. Assuming that no such claim exists, or could be substantiated, the alternatives are to recognise the area as belonging to Ibn Saud ; to recognise it as belonging to the Sheikh of Qatar ; or to regard it as a political no-man's land. 13. If we recognised it as belonging to Ihn Saud we could, if necessary, call upon him to keep Bedouin raids into Qatar from it under control. But such recognition would not merely be inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the 1913 Convention, to the abandonment of which, as stated above, the objections appear to be strong, but would represent a formal acceptance of Saudi sovereignty to the borders or Qatar and Abu Dhabi which might well prove embarrassing. 14. If, on the other hand, it is attributed to the Sheikh of Qatar, we should be justified in expecting the full co-operation of the Sheikh in dealing with Bedouin activities within its limits. But such an attribution would not merely give to Qatar a substantial area which she does not in the past appear to have claimed, but would extend the limits of any liability for protection which we may undertake in connection with the grant of an oil concession. It might be necessary to claim the area (or at any rate its coastal strip) for Qatar if there were serious signs of foreign interest in it or of an intention on the part of Ibn Saud to occupy it. But pending such developments it seems wiser to limit our commitments and to avoid any extension of the area recognised by us as Qatar.(5) 5 15. The decision to regard it as a political no-man s land would, so far as can be judged, be likely to mean little more than the acceptance of the de facto position to-day. As will be seen from paragraphs 16 to 18 below, the area, save for the Barr-al-Qarah district, is largely desert, peopled by nomadic tribes yielding uncertain allegiance to Ibn Saud, and it appears to differ little in general couditions from the Rub-al-Khali further south. Admittedly the absence of a limitrophe ruler who could be made responsible for the activities of his subjects, may make it more difficult to secure the southern border of Qatar against nomadic Bedouins. But the difficulties involved may be less than they appear. The difficulties of any alternative to regarding the tract as of indeterminate ownership are great, and at any rate as a provisional policy there would appear to be much to be said for treating this area as indeterminate in ownership and avoiding, if possible, raising the thorny questions of its boundaries to the west and of political control within it with Ibn Saud, Nature and Political Conditions of the Indeterminate Area. 16. Before reaching a conclusion it may be well to place on record such scanty information as is available about the nature and the political conditions of the indeterminate area. Apart from the coastal district known as the Barr-al-Oarah, which is further discussed in paragraph 18 below, the bulk of it appears to belong to the Jafurah desert, which Lorimer describes as an area ' possessing only a few wells of very bitter water, a little scanty grazing, with a surface of red and burning Ijor - J 1 ' sand,' in which living conditions are extremely difficult and which is frequented 3 ' to any considerable extent' only by 'the hardy A1 Morrah. and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from more powerful enemies ' (c/. Appendix, section I (vi)). Since the date of Lorimer's Gazetteer, Mr. Bertram Thomas, on his recent crossing of the Rub-al-Khali, has passed through this area from south to north, travelling from the well of Banaiyan near Latitude 23° 11' 40' via Haluwain, Nakhala, and the western extremity of a salt lake lying immediately west of the Khor-al-'Odeid, across the pre-war Qatar frontier to Dohah. His account is of importance because it makes it clear that such local control as is exercised is exercised solely by nomad Bedouin tribes (and principally the A1 Murra, who are a tribe dwelling in the sands, whose influence extends well down into the Rub-al-Khali). Secondly, even though he travelled with a 'rabia,' or guarantor, from the A1 Murra Arabia tribe, the journey was rendered extremely dangerous by the risk of an attack on the Felix, party by Ikhwan fanatics, who roam apparently at large, over the whole area. ZIQ-I, 281. Thirdly, the sites of Salwa, Iskak (?—Sakak) and Mabak, the first two of which lie on, Arabia and the third slightly south of, the pre-war boundary of Qatar, were at the time of Felix ' his journey in the hands of the Ikhwan, with the result that he could not visit them. f 00 ^ote 17. On the question of political couditions Mr. Thomas throughout his journey (the route of which lay well to the east of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention) from the centre of the Rub-al-Khali northwards to the Persian Gulf refers to the established influence of Ibn Saud and its beneficent results, and remarks: ' To-day peace, the peace of Bin Saud, prevails throughout the sands. The influence of the Ruler of Central Arabia, wielded through his able Viceroy at Ilofuf, Ibn Jiluwi, compels peace between all these old enemies, not through direct pp. 271-2. control, for there is and can be none, but through the immense personal prestige of Abdul Aziz himself. A belief in his strength and star has swept across the sands. Not love, but awe, serves this wise providence that so directs affairs. . . . Thus, the sand tribes proper are in some degree leagued with Bin Saud. They pay to him a nominal tribute and by that act are ensured mutual protection one from the other. In theory the tribute is au annual levy of one dollar on each camel. In practice, the Rashid have no money, and in any event they escape proper payment by reason of their remoteness. They do, however, send a camel from year to year as occasion offers in token of submission. When, however, rains fall in the northern sands and they migrate thither, the tax-gatherers' demands must be met, and a few camels are sold for the purpose. Light as is the bond, the tribes grumble at it. . . . They all swear that the existing peace shall last only as long as the present regime of Riyadh. Let Riyadh or Hofuf be thought to have lost its power, and raiding will be resumed immediately, and blood will flow again. ...' Mr. Thomas's remarks may be compared with those of Mr. Philby (who in 1932 travelled through the Barr-al-Qarah area and thence south-west to the Jabrin oasis) reproduced in section 111 of the Appendix to this Note. 2560 A 2n i (d) The area lying between the blue line and the boundaries recognised for Qatar as in (a) above to be regarded, subject to confirmation by the Resident that no claim to them is made or could be substantiated west of Aqal by Abu Dhabi, as of indeterminate ownership. As it appears to be largely inhospitable desert under Ikhwan control, save for the coastal strip of the Barr al-Qarah, the likelihood that oil companies will actively interest themselves in it is probably small. If they do, on the principle that Ibn Saud has no interest east of the blue line, it might be necessary to consider whether to attribute it to Qatar or Abu Dhabi (the wording ot the 1913 Convention, as quoted in paragraph 5 above, would assist us in claiming it for Qatar). It would in any event be desirable, in order to prevent foreign interests from endeavouring to establish a foothold in it, to consider in what way it could best be made clear that we regarded it as falling within our own sphere of influence or that of one of our Trncial allies. (e) When once oil operations have started in Qatar, to convey a warning (if and when circumstances should make this appear advisable) through the Sheikh of Qatar to the migratory Bedouin tribes who use the area referred to in {d) that in the event of their crossing, with hostile intent or save for normal peaceful pursuits, such as grazing, such line as may be fixed as the boundary of Qatar, they will do so at their own peril. The local political authorities would no doubt be able to ascertain and to advise what customary rights in respect of grazing, &amp;c. these migratory tribes at present enjoy within Qatar proper. On the question whether any corresponding intimation should be made to Ibn Saud in respect of tribes permanently belonging to Nejd but using the indeterminate area it seems definitely preferable, in the interest of avoiding discussion with him of the position of the indeterminate area and of the blue line, to make no communication unless and until circumstances make this quite inevitable. The question of any communication in respect of Nejdi tribes (if any) using Qatar territory could equally be postponed unless and until circumstances may make it necessary to consider it. India Office, .J. G. Laithwaitk. 26th January 1934. [N.B. —The conclusions suggested in paragraph 19 were accepted by the Government of India and the Political Resident in their telegrams Nos. 408 of 21st February and 244 of 27th February respectively. His Majesty's Minister at Jedda has suggested consideration of the desirability of leaving the boundaries of Qatar ' undefined until the time comes to assert Blue Line principle' (Jedda Saving telegram No, 8 of 14th February).] APPENDIX. Boundaries of Qatar. I.— Extracts from Lorimer's Gazetteer. (i) Qatar. {N.B. —Mr. Lorimer's article on Qatar is stated to be the result of special enquiries made over a number of years locally.) Lorimer, Vol. II, page 1506, defines the boundaries of Qatar as follows ' On the east, north and west, Qatar is surrounded by the sea. The southern boundary is somewhat indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dohat -as -Salwa on the western side of the promontory, and from that point runs south-eastwards to the wells of Sakak; thence, according to one account, it strikes east-north east to the north end of the Naqiyan sandhills, or, according to another, east by south to the southern end of the same hills on the north side of the entrance to Khor-al-'Odaid. As the territory of the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has never clearly been asserted to extend beyond Khor-al-'Odaid, and as the Al-Thani Sheikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the Naqiyan tract, the latter of the two8 alternative Hues is to be preferred ; the British Government have recognised Khor-al-'Odaid as belonging to Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot be placed nearer to Trucial Oman, though the Al-Thani Sheikhs assert a right to the whole coast as far as the Sabakhat Matti. It is said that three men stationed at Dohat-as-Salwa, Sakak and Niqa-al-Maharah, respectively, can watch the whole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea.' (ii) Khor-al- Odaid. In Vol. II, on page 1367, Mr. Lorimer describes Khor-al-Odaid as 'an inlet or creek on the coast of the Abu Dhabi principality as its extreme western end: it lies about 180 miles almost due west from the town of Abu Dhabi. The boundary of Qatar is either at, or a short distance to the north of, the inlet.' (iii) , Aqal. In Vol. II, pages 88-80, Mr. Lorimer describes 'Aqal as 'a small littoral district at the base of'the Qatar peninsula upon the east side ; it is bounded by Khor-al-Odaid on the north-west and by Dohat-an-Nakharlah on the south-east, the distance between which in a direct line is nearly 35 miles. Inland the depth of the district is on an average about 20 miles.' [N.B.—Nathil (Saudah) in 'Aqal is 20 to 25 miles inland, Lor. II, 89. westward, from the foot of Khor-al-'Odaid.] ' On the landward side 'Aqal is enclosed by Mijan on the east, the Jafurah desert on the south and south-west, and by Qatar on the north-west. . . . The Bedouins do not regard 'Aqal as geographically included in Oman, wnich in their view is terminated on the west by the babakhat Matti; but the district has been recognised by the British Government as forming part of the territories of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and must therefore be considered to belong, in the political sense, to Trucial Oman.' (iv) Aim Dhahi. In Vol. 11, page 405, under 'Ahu Dhabi' Mr. Lorimer remarks: 'Upon the coast Abu Dhabi reaches from ... to Khor-al-'Odaid on the west—a distance of over 200 miles. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended to the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, near Wakrah in Qatar, but his claim was not approved by the Government of India; Bishairiyah has also been named as the limit of his State in this direction, but no good reason has been adduced for supposing tiiat his jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al-'Odaid, though the northern shore of that inlet should perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories. Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined, it is asserted that on the east they reach to the Baraimi oasis, but without taking it in, and on the south they may sumably be placed at the margin of the Kuba -al-Khali. (v) Barr-al-Qarah. Lorimer, II, 1482. ' A coastal tract in Eastern Arabia which may perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of Ilasa [itself, for the puiposes^ of the Anglo- Turkish Convention of 1913, included in the Ottoman Sandjak of Nejd]. It leaches from Has-as-Sufairah on the north to the bottom of Dohat-as-Salwa on tho south, a distance of about 36 miles ; and inland it extends to a depth of about 12 miles. Upon the coast it meets Barr-al-'Oqair to the north and Qatar to the south of it, and inland, in all directions, it merges in the Jafurah desert. Some authoiities would even make Barr-al-'Qarah a part of Jafurah. . . (vi) Jafurah. Lorimer, II, 892, describes the Jafurah desert as extending ' the whole way from the Hasa Oasis to the confines of Trucial Oman. ... In shape it is roughly triangular, with its apex on the north almost touching a line drawn between l lofuf and Oqair port, and its other corners (to the south-west and south-east) ^ adjoining the Oasis of Jabrin and the southern extremity of Sabakhat Matti respectively. . . . On the east it is separated from the sea' from north to south ' by Barr-al-'Qarah, Qatar, 'Aqal and Mijan ; on the south it is bounded by the Ruba-al-Khali. It may be added here that Jafurah encloses Jabrin upon the north and east and that, in the opinion of some, Barr -al-'Qarah is a portion of Jafurah desert and not a separate tract.9 ' Jafurah differs from the waterless Ruba-al-Khali only in possessing a few wells ot very bitter water and a little scanty grazing; its surface consists of red and burning sand. ' The Ajman venture into the northern extremity of Jafurah, but the only tribe who frequent it to any considerable extent are the hardy A1 Morrah and even they avoid ^ entering it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from powerful enemies. . . . While sojourning in Jafurah the A1 Morrah as a rule drink nothing but the milk of their camels and even cook their rice in the same ; if compelled to swallow water ^ from the wells they first mix it with dried dates to make it more palatable. The Wahabis have frequently waged -war upon the A1 Morrah, but Faisal alone, if local tradition is to be believed, succeeded in penetrating with his troops as far as Banaiyan, and his force was so reduced by the hardships of the desert march that he was compelled on his arrival tliere to grant the tribe exceedingly easy terms.' II.—Anglo-Tdrkish Convention of 1913 (unratified). El-Katr. Article 11. ' Le Sandjak Ottoman de Nedjd, dont la limite septentrionale est indiquee par la ligne de demarcation definie a I'article 7 de cette convention, se termine vers le sud au golfe faisant face a Tile de Zahnounie, qui appartient au dit Sandjak. Une ligne partant du fond extreme du dit golfe ira directement au Sud jusqu'au Ruba-al-Khali et separera le Nedjd de la presqu'ile d'El-Katr. Les limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue sur la carte annexee a la presente Convention (annexe VA). Le Gouvernement Imperial Ottoman ayant renonce a toutes ses reclamations concernant la presqu'ile d'El Katr, il est entendu entre les deux Gouvernements que ladite presqu'ile sera, comme par le passe, gouvernee par le cheikh Djassim-bin-Sani et par ses successeurs. Le gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britannique declare qu'il ne permettra pas au cheikh de Bahraine de s'immiscer dans les aflaires interieures d'El Katr, de porter atteinte a I'autonomie de ce pays, ou de I'annexer.' [The blue line in question runs due south from the head of the bay opposite Zaknuniyeh Island to the 20th parallel of latitude, where it meets the line of demarcation between Turkish Arabia and the Aden Protectorate laid down under the Anglo-Turkish agreement of 3rd June 1914.] III.—Mr. Piiilby's Journey of 1932. Mr. Philby in his crossing of the Ruba-al-Khali in 1932 passed through the Barr-al-Qarah coastal belt with the assistance of Ibn rliluwi and the Hasa authorities, turning south-west at Salwa and proceeding thence to the Jabrin Oasis. The following extract from his book ' The Empty Quarter ' is of interest, and supplements the evidence of Mr. Bertram Thomas as recorded in paragraphs 16-18 of the Note ;— p. 28. ' Ali Jahman . . . rode far ahead gossiping about his experiences on a recent tax collecting expedition to the south-eastern districts along the frontier of Oman. ... I was interested to hear from him that Ibn Sa'ud's influence is felt to-day in all the Dhahira countr} 7 , as they call the tract westward of the Oman Massif, including, of course, Buraimi, a Wahhabi centre of long standing, and apparently even Ibri. These tax collecting expeditions scarcely perhaps do more than pay the expenses involved in equipping and sending them out, but they do tend to spread the gospel of Wahhabi peace and Arabian unity. Slowly but surely the ripples of stable government broaden outwards from the centre and the Manasir may be counted to-day as subjects of Ibn Saud, who asks little ^ of them but the acceptance of his sovereignty and the maintenance of his peace. . . .' [N.B. —The Manasir tribe are concentrated in the Abu Dhabi area, ranging from * Qatar to the Baraimi Oasis.] jy—Note of Discussion with Sir Percy Cox on 20th February 1934 on Question of Boundaries of Qatar. Consequent on the recent investigations into the southern boundary of Qatar Sir Percy Cox was good enough to come to the India Office on 20th February to discuss the conversations reported in Colonel Dickson's despatch, Confidential, No. 143, of 4tli July, to have taken place between Sir Percy, Ibn Saud and Major Holmes in November/December 1922.10 2. Sir Percy Cox said that he had kept no private uotes as to what passed at his meeting with Ibn Sand on the occasion in question. Anything he had reported or recorded on the subject would have been left on record at Baghdad; but to the best of his recollection and belief the facts and circnmstances were as follows : — 3. The specific object with which, accompanied by Iraq representatives, he went to meet Ibn Sand at Ojair was to induce him to ratify the Mohammerah Agreement of 5th May 1922. Sir Percy proceeded to the rendezvous without any knowledge that he would there meet Major Holmes or would have occasion to express any opinion as to the boundaries of the Qatar Peninsula; but learning from Major Holmes, and from the map that he produced, that he was endeavouring to obtain from Ibn Sand a concession for exploiting oil in an area which included the Qatar Peninsula, he (Sir Percy Cox) naturally informed Major Holmes—and no doubt Ibn Sand also—that this could not be. If he had then been asked, as he doubtless must have been, what he considered should be excluded, as constituting Qatar, Sir Percy would undoubtedly have based his answer on his own knowledge, as Resident in the Persian Gulf for many years, namely, that, on the east coast, Qatar's boundary with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi's territory was the head of the Khor-al-'Odaid, and on the west coast the head of Salwa Bay, This, in Sir Percy's recollection, w T as the position recognised in the Bushire Residency and adopted by Lorimer in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer. Sir Percy probably had the Gazetteer with him, but on the above point he would hardly have needed to consult it. In any case he is positive that the Anglo-Turkish Blue Line of 1913 was never mentioned, and is of opinion that any view which he expressed incidentally and ex tempore could not reasonably be regarded as the official pronouncement of the Hasa-Qatar boundary contemplated in our first treaty with Ibn Sand (December 1915) in which it figured as one of those to be ' hereafter determined.' Moreover, Sir Percy Cox states that he informed both Ibn Sand and Major Holmes that His Majesty's Government ought to be consulted before any concession was granted. 4. Sir Percy said that in these circumstances it seemed to him that His Majesty's Government were entirely free, in so far as the conversations of 1922 were concerned, to maintain against Ibn Saud the Blue Line of the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as the eastern boundary of Nejd. 5. Sir Percy said he was not aware whether either Ibn Saud or the Sheikh of Qatar had ever advanced a definite claim to the ownership of the Barr-al-Qarah coastal tract, between Zakhnuniyeh and Salwa, but it seemed to him that if occasion arose in the future for a compromise it would be a reasonable course to assign tO' Ibn Saud, in view of his strong position at Ojair close by, that length of coast line with its hinterland, up to the Blue Line. This would have the advantage of leaving no indeterminate area along the sea-coast. J. G. L.
