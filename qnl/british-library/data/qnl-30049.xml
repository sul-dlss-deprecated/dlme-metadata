I am sorry to hear that your visit to Dhofor was so disappointing. I do not think you need be too much worried by the fact that you have not heard from the Sultan. The communications with Dhofar are very bad and a letter of his dated the 2nd November did not reach me until the 12th December. I do not know when he is returning to -iuscat, but if I see him during the next few months I will endeavour to discover if he is offended with you. Sir Cyril S.

Dear Hay, Something has gone wrong at Salalah as I have not had a line since I took Me Pherson there in October. The Company - Selection Trust - gambled on the Lead Ore which I had not visited and did not consider anything like as important as cement. However, i-ic Pherson knew more. He was unfortunately affected by his inocculation and was a sick man even when we got to Salalah and saw the Sultan, Said bin Taimur had gone to immense trouble to make the 1 place’ accessible and we had to go 5 miles on camel to the ’mine’. It was useless. The country looked ’poor’ for mineral ores. However, when we got back to Salalah Me Pherson decided to leave next day as a plane was calling, we saw the Sultan early next morning (l had written the evening before) and he kept me awhile after Me Pherson had gone. I explained that Me Pherson was on a gamble but the Company would consider the cement. Said bin Taimur was friendly and asked me to get him more — wrist watches. He had letters aoout investments trom Lloyds ^ank, about houses from Harrods &amp; Hampton etc., about Air Conditioning Plants, etc. and appreciated all the efforts I had made for him in town, but I think he felt I should have stayed over. As I was receiving no ^fee from anyone but Selection Trust were paying expenses (the Sultan did not charge anything) and Me Pherson was still not quite well I felt I should go back with him (partly to prevent any m is- understanding regarding the visit to the ’Lead Mine ; Perhaps I should have stayed on for the next plane. Anyhow although I have kept in touch with Selection Trust Ltd. and written and cabled to the Sultan I have had no reply or letter or communication of any kind. Indeed I had found a stock of 10” pipes 3 5. s a metre here in Egypt for the Sultan ready for collection by dhow. I aifiiply do not know how I may have offended him innocently but he has not sent me a line or message. I was ready to go out again to clear up details both for Selection Trust and the Iraq Petroleum Co. and left word at the Foreign Office so that^you would be kept informed but the position is ’dead’ so far any ansv/ers etc. from Said bin Tai/mur is concerned. . I am very sorry and I have lost time and money on it but this is nothing to any loss of friendship when I have done my utmost for the Sultan. Yours sincerely, (Signed) Cyril S.

My dear Friend, Thank you very much for your kind letter dated the 27th September which I received on the l?th October when Sir Cyril Fox arrived here. I regret that I am still unable to say anything about my return to Muscat but I hope to let you know tov/ards the end of December. I am afraid it unlikely that we will be able to negotiate the new treaty before the expiry of the present treaty and in that case I would suggest _ that present may be prolonged for sometime. I hope this will be agreeable. I am expecting Dr. Thoms to arrive here on the 10th instant and he is expected to stay in Salalah and treat the people till the end of November. I hope you and your family have enjoyed your leave in England and must have returned to Bahrain by now. By the grace of God I and my son Qaboos are keeping in good health and the climate here is pleasant as usual. Mr. Hewitt of the Desert Locust Survey will come here towards the end of this month and will start his camel journey to Ivlaughshin and then co Hadhramst. Sir Cyril Fox and Mr. McPharson of Selection Trust Company were disappointed about the lead order site as they found it to be in a very small quan- tity. I hope we will be able to lind ior uhem somethingelse. The fishing season here is not so very good as expected hut it is just the beginning. My compliments to Lady Hay and your daughters.

Mr. Bosworth arrived at the aerodrome last night and he will be leaving this morning at 9 a.m. with Dr. 1’homs and his family. It appears that your excellency has not received my letter of November 2nd in which I mentioned about my return to Muscat. That letter was in reply to your letter dated the 27th September which I received on the 1?th October when Sir Cyril ^ox came here. In my letter I said that I shall let you know about my return towards the end of December and that I would suggest that the Old Treaty may be prolonged for sometime as it seems unlikely that we will be able to negotiate the New Treaty before the expiry of the Old one. I hope this will be agreeable. However if I find that I am able to let you know about my return before the end of December then I shall inform immediately or otherwise. Yes, the newspapers sometimes write something which has no foundation and so the radio broadcast§4nd I thank you for mentioning the matter. I am very glad to know that you and your family are well and that you are expecting your youngest daughter out for Christmas. Kindly give them my compliments.

I saw him just before I left the U.K. and I think he was due to leave for Salalah on the 7th October, taking with him a representative of Security Trust Limited which is, if I remember rightly, the name of the firm which he is trying to interest in Dhofar minerals. I consulted the Foreign Office about the firm and they in turn consulted the Board of Trade v/ho have reported favourably about it. The Foreign Office have informed Fox to this effect. The Foreign Office v/ith my concurrence told the Air Ministry that they sponsored Fox f s visit to Salalah with the firm’s representative. This was to enable Fox to obtain passages from Aden in an R.A.F. plane. Major F. C. L. Chauncy, Political Agent, Muscat.Major F.C.L. Chauncy, Political Agent, Muscat.

H. B. IT s Consulate and Political Agency, njSCAT. 13th October, 1950. Yy dear Sir Rupert I have now received from Pastern Depart: ent a copy of 'what purports to be an authority given by the Sultan to Sir Cyril Pox to offfcrjto any well known reputable conpany an exclusive licence to prospect for minerals other than natural gas and crude petroleum and cognate substances and products. neither I nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs had any 2 previous intimation of this from the fjultan. It seems that it was only mooted and decided upon by Sir Cyril and the Sultan during the former’s recent visit to Salalah. The licence appears to provide solely for the offering of 3. a prospecting licence for 2 years, and mining can only take place a. ter subsequent negotiation and agreement. Only a token payment of 10 V.T. Dollars is required for the licence and Tir Cyril appears to derive no remuneration, unless of course he can sell the offer in some way to the compary which may seek the licence, or head such company as a Director or Chairman. 4. Beyond giving an exclusive right to prospect for a limit of two years, the Sultan has in no way committed himself by this document. Nor does his action appear in ary way to cross British interests or be affected by the provisions of any Treaty with Fis ^-^ajesty’s Government. Nor, I think, in spite of Sir Cyril Pox being a British subject and the offer being to a British Company, was there any reason for the Sultan to rake us aware of his intentiomor actions in this respect, whilst w may on the contrary welcome the fact that he has confined the offer only to a British concern, and count it among the few signs of his desire to develop his territory.

I am submitting a review of the Sultanate finances separately. I have confirmed from Woods-Ballard that the Sultan has no intention ever of seeking outsiue financial assistance, partly, because he y&amp;tt&amp;s there would be unpalatable strings tied to it, and partly because he is scared stiff of any kind of indebtedness, but mainly, in this case, because he has no need of it. 3- He has only just received Hartley's report, and it will take him a considerable time to digest it. It would be useless to ask him about it yet, as he would surely reply that he has yet to consider it; and in any case observation invariably proves to be the only method of getting any reliable information about the Sultan's plans. 4. My own impressions of the report is that it will be most helpful and I think Woods-Ballard is likely to recommend it to the Sultan (as indeed he has already done in a preliminary report he submitted himself just after Hartley's visit). 5. No one knows what the Sultan may deciae. I think this will appeal to him, and he is certainly implement ing several of the previous recommendations made by Hartley in his report on Dhufar,and a forest officer is due to arrive in Salalah shortly. Just now (though I doubt it is solely in this connection) there are signs of the Sultan considerably prolonging his stay, for he has asked Dr. Thoms to go to Dhufar by launch in the first week of November.

MUSCAT. 16th May, 1950. My dear Sir oipert, The Sultan told me that he had heard from Sir Cyril Pox and was replying saying that he would be glad to see him at any time at Salalah, before he leaves in October. As his letter may take some time to reach him, the Sultan asked if you would very kindly also let Sir Cyril know. 2. As regards your letter about the Treaty to the Sultan, via R.A.P. Aden, His Highness said he had not yet received this. 3. The Sultan reciprocated your good wishes ( I also delivered your letter to him which I carried ), and was glad to hear of your visit to Cwadur. I am writing separately about the Sultan's feelings about the Pakistan Government attitude and about which Woods-Ballard had already told him. 4* With regard to your not being met by Woods-Ballard and Wynne, Woods-Ball&amp;rd had also mentioned this to the Sultan, who, after stressing his unalterable affection for and gratitude to His ^^a^esty's Government and personal regard for you, said that the custom was that where there is a British representative at a place, no representative of the Muscat Government will receive the British official but, if the rank of the person warrants it, will call later. 5. The procedure followed on this occasion at Gwadur was in accordance with this practice and His Highness feels that elfen though one or more of his officials may be British subjects this should make no difference: they should act as Muscat Government officials. 6. There was no objection to the Consul being present during the Minister for Foreign Affairs or Administrator's calls, as a member of Political Resident's staff, and his exclusion on this occasion was &amp; misunderstanding. 7. The Sultan hoped more than anything that you realise his ardent desire to give all possible respect to any representative of His Majesty's Government, and he will discuss the matter further with you when you next meet him, should you desire. Yours sincerely. His SxeeHency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE,, CSX. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

His Excellency the Political Resident has received instructions regarding the acknowledgement and formal reply to His Highness the Sultan’s letter about the 1939 Treaty, but unfortunately could not get his letter to Ilia Highness ready * in time for delivery by His Majesty’s Consul.

ANi) 014AN* Introduction. I visited the nhufar Frovince at the imitation of Sultan Saiyid Said bin fainrur who aslted for a survey to be :nade of conditions in Dhufar and particularly * for advice on the crowing' of Sugar Cane. I travelled from Riyan to Ualalah on 22nd llovembor and toured the district until 28th November when I left again by air, for Aden, burin c my visit X was most hospitably received by the Sultan who gave me every facility to see as much of the country as was possible in the small amount of time at my disposal. Under the Sultans directions, I received every help from the Jtate Officials in Uhufar. 2. Viith motor transport provided and with the assistance of Mr. Pradham Bin h the State En Ineer, I was able to examine the coastal plain anc to obtain some idea of its rural economy, time was also found for a journey into the mountains as far as the water-shed between the Indian Ocean and the Empty Quarter. This brief tour over a representative cross-section of the bhufar Province has enabled me to present a preliminary survey report on the area. Special attention was paid to the possibilities of Sugar Cane and more detailed attention is given to this particular crop in various sections of iiie report# general Assessment of Potentialities• 3. For the purpose of this report, the bhufar Province is o considered to include the section of country lyin : between 43°45 ,f East Longitude and 34°45 East Longitude on a line roughly on 16*50 forth Latitude, and extend in northward to 17*45 e. latitude. This embraces the coastli rom has i-rsut to has Uinjeli and in depth the country behind this coastline to the dry steppe which borders on the desert. 4. The area of the Jebel Qamr alike in many respects to the Jeoel gara but with a rainfall which diminishes as one proceeds v^est is not included. • 5. The productive land in the area may be conveniently divided into three zones:- (a) The coastal plain on which perennial irrigation flourishes. (b) The moist hi :hland areas with a southerly inclination. (c) The drier steppe areas which lie on the Northern side of the water-shed between the moist hill gazings and the c’esert. 6* The desert areas to the North are not considered in this report. / The boastal ilain. the 7. The coastal plain known as^Jurbaid is roughly 140,000 acres in extent and of this it is estimated that 90 ,o 00 acres are flat add if given water supplies could be prepared for irrigation farmin • The plain is underlain by limestone in various forms and is covered by a thin layer of soil of poor to average fertility. The rainfall on the plain is about six inches but this small precipitation which falls alraost entirely durin the cloudy monsoon weather in July, August and Septemberis sufficient to grow a thin stand of passes* Near to the range which backs the plain the herbage thickens and scrub growth invades the grasses. It is said that the coastal plain was once well covered with acacia scrub and trees but the depredations of fuel cutters and, in the area near to ualalah, a deliberate destruction policy for reasons of security, has caused the removal of the useful fodder plants. On. the Jurbaid permanent waters from springs and from shallow wells are used for irrigation purposes.' 'the plain is backed by a limestone escarpment and irom the foot of this range several springs eraerge and -these are led by gravity feed for irrigation on the coastal olain. At present some four springs with a total permanent dry weather discharge estimated at 2^.25 cu.secs. are martially developed for irrigation but at the time of writing some 280 acres only are said to be under crop. wells . 10 . Some 200 wells irrigating an area of 1200 acres are said to be in operation on the coastal plain. These wells are generally found within a mile of the seashore and tap the shallow ground water supplies in the miliolitic limestone area. The Intermediate humid Zone. 11 • xiiis may be uaken as all the land wa occupied by the escarpment and mountains with a southerly inclination. Rain fall in the most favoured parts of thi£ area is probably over 30 inches and the country is for many months of the year in the cloud belt and subject to mist and drift. In this area livestock farming is the main occupation. Cattle are herded mainly on the well-grassed uplands while down below in the steeper scrub areas considerable numbers of camels and goats a./e icepT;. The total area occupied by land under this type of production is estimated at 520,000 acres. The Dry Grazings on the Northerly Slopes . 12. The storm drift and mist which comes in from the sea causes precipitation on the southerly slopes but, as soon as the northerly slopes are reached - where the A1 c^utun uplands uiie drainage of the O&amp;rn Shaiba, a marked alteration is ..ouiid in tne ran ee vegetation, the grasses become shorter and more tufted,bare patches are frequent and animal paths are subject to a certain amount of erosion. On this area cattle are grazed duri ig the wet season - at a time when these grazings are at their best, and when there is less trouble from biting flies which are said to pester the cattle in the more humid zones. The total of these short grass xazinjs is tentively estimated at 700,000 acres. Beyond this zone are trie desert brazings where goats and camels are the main type of livestock pastured. North of the short grass zone the' s frankincense and Myrrh trees are found. In the past vast ' weal oh has been gained from these incense bearing areas and up to recent times the poor beduin have relied on the collection of the gum incense for their means of livelihood. Today there is little demand and the country has suffered in consequence* Physical Conditions Ooverning farming. 13* The province of Dhufar is remarkable for the climatic advantages which it enjoys over any other part of South Arabia of similar elevation. It has a true monsoonal climate. Sir Cyril Pox has summarised the climatic conditions thus:-- 3 - The r s‘ , _ climate throughout Dhufar gets very hot by May nhfn ^ he J a ^ ns . come * Then everything is suddenly ctian^ed. The ry hot a:tr becomes waarra and humid, Mists han,' oyer the Jiarbaid until late in the afternoon, or all day and ij. :nt, v/hile it is raining on the hills which are wrapped in clouds. The temperature in the plains (Jurbaid) rises as high ao l-c7 deagrees 'ahrenheit at the end of Hay and falls to 90 degrees^at the end of June with a high humidity. 'The rainfall on tno o oroaid is probably not more t}ian an average of 5 inches xor ine lour months - June to September. There is no rainfall m these coastal plains between October to June, and the oemperauure may oe as low as ?0 degrees in January in dry air conaitions. it is very much better in the hills, but there rain on the Jabal Qara in the cold weather and January. Dhufar is the only section of experience a typical south-west monsoon of India, particularly the Western G-hats and be 10 may be some winter months of December Southern Arabia to the kind normal to the Deccan plateau. , , reason becomes evident from a study of trie coasts oi one Arabian bea and western. Indian Ocean, namely, that Somaliland shelters the Gulf of u en on the South and so removes the possible conditions for a wet south-west monsoon for the area of the dadhranaut even though it lias elevations up oo .. ,,000 feet. Eastward, in the Sultanate of Oman there are •two areas of highlands - the mountains of Dhufar including Jabal war;- r, dabal (^ara and Jabal Samhan with elevations up to 3,boo yO 4 ,000 feet, and. tne mountains of ^■man beiiind 1 unseat - includin : tne Dastem and Western Ha jar r/ith Jabal iildidliar risin ; to nearly 10 , 0 . 0 xeet (in uhe peak of Jabal Sham, 9,900 feet). Between the mountains of Oman and those of Dhufar there is a wide belt of low desert (the south-eastward extension of the Ar liramal (the auds), which includes the Hab*al Kiiali Umpcy region), of south-east Arabia. The coastal strip from the hills oi Ja 1 a Lan (40 miles south-west of Has A1 Had) for nearly 375 miles (including the island f i asira and the gulf of I^asira and Sauqira and Kuria * uxia cays) has no hi filand oehind it hi -her than 750 feet on the avera e, if -chat much. Tnus a strong moisture-laden wind from the Arabian &gt;ea off the oomali coast will encounter high lands only in the mountains of Oman on Thie one hand and on these of Dhufar on the other, and will yield moisture, as rain, in these two areas and not on the country between them. In addition to the south-west monsoon, the mountains of ‘Oman also have rain from a north-east monsoon similar to the eastern highlands of hadras. Hart of this north-east monsoon may yield the winter rains of the Jabal ' ara and adjacent highlands of Dhufar.* Hun-off. 14. Run-off from the portion of the hills which have a southerly aspect is carried out to sea by a few flood courses which cross the Jurbaid. The run-off percenta *e would in all probability bo conunrablo to that «oun-J in i-ost sub—iiiimid areas but A.ith the exception that a ,;reat deal of i^/ater must £&gt;ass underground tfirou^Ji the numerous cracks and crevices of the limestone which comprises the basic geolo ical feature of the whole area. /ID* To the north the percentage of run-off is probably greater on account of the less dense vegetal cover, but again much ou this run—off may be taken up by eva^poration and by absorption - for the slope to the north is gentle, compared to the precipitious falls to the south. * The Geology and mineral Resources of Dhui'ar .Province, Muscat and Oman by bir Oyril 0 . fox, D.Se., F.G.S., M.I.Min.E., Until more is known about the rainfall and until discharge measurements have been taken for the flood courses and ?fl S r^ 0WS i th Te is little point in attempting any ^stL^?e. It is obvious though that use could be made of seasonal flows irom the ^adi systems particularly those which cross the Jurbaid. An estimate given by Sir Cyril iTox puts the figijre at 131,200 million cu.feet for the flood discharge from southerly flowin-* streams during the rains• b Permanent Water Supplies. v n The permanent water supplies of the area have been well described oy bir oyril i. (i ox. The following statement gives the amount of water calculated by Sir Cyril Pox for three permanent waoer supplies which are used at present and the actual areas cropped irom these supplies based on information supplied by Mr. Pradhan Singh, the State Engineer.

The fresh watex tapped is that seeping from the mountains to the sea and the area most favoured for this well development is found in aosocianon with deposits of miliolitic limestone. 23 # The wells are rnade shallow but with a large diameter -- 5 - they have a fair delivery, but it is noticeable that a team of .our camels working the water lift are trained to walk up and '..own The ramp in alioriiaie pairs in order io even out: the draw on the wells. 24. There are traces throughout the plain of many old well sites and with comparatively small expenditure the area under present cultivation from wells could be considerably increased, me possibility of linking a large number of wells with electric pumps to a central power station is worth considering. Such a development could, of course, profitably follow the discovery o.: oil in the district. On present evidence the yield of the majority of these shallow wells is insufficient for a delivery of much over 4&gt;000 gallons per hour. o. In assessing the development possibilities of the permanent flow from springs develoxjment of su plies from wells and from t-he lOior a figure of 4&gt;000 acres is considered to be a oafe es cimate oi the area which could be put under permanent irn ;ation. Soils . f ^• Tile soils or the coastal plain may in general be ciassev- as thin and rather poor calcareous loams. In some pockets i.uey have depth and more fertility, while in some of the valley areas near to the escarpment more fertile soils are noticeable'. An example of this sort can be seen at a/imo irah, the newly opened garden area. under any permanent system of cropping, the coastal piain soils require frequent manuring and this fact is fully realised and understood by the farmer. In some areas near to ..he sea snore salty lands are found and cultivation is limited on this account.

Sweet pourjo&amp;s are important and lucerne is commonly xown oi/ever^vell plot in order' to raise ^ d H d , er the camels which are employed to work the water lifts on the wells. A small acreage of cotton is grown and the proouce is * sed locally, some of it being spun for thread used +l le of i ishin, lines and nets. Pocoanuts are a feature i the coastal strip where most of the wells are situated; they 2 • . r down to the seashore? and do well without artificial irri ation when once established. 2 g., . ^ success of cocoanuts in this area is probably due to the favourable n^onsoon climate which affords a satisfactory . lowering period folr the pains and secondly to the availability of a movin ; ground water supply at a shallow depth below the'' J/&lt; -lip •mm 31• In some plantations it is foand necessary to penetrate the layer of railiolitic limestone found on the coastal plain before planting, and, in the case of cocoanuts which fail to thrive after planting, it is the practice to excavate holes to one side of the palm in order to allow of root penetration. At Salalah I observed this practice and saw that the stone so removed was being used for building purposes. Good palms are said to yield 100 to 150 nuts per ; ear. Che price of a good palm is said to be 8 dollars at present. 32 . ifo copra is made but people make use of the fresh oocoanut milk and flesh. The milk, I was informed, is used to cook fish and other food, fresh nuts are exported to iuscat and other ports. Sugar Pane. 33 * A small amount of cane is .grown for chewing on the wells. Two varieties, one a red rather /.ard cane, the other a thin soft cane are seen. Most of the stands seen Y,ere inferior in quality and rowth. The custom is to ratoon for several years. &gt;;rops Crow n on f ere: u.ial Xr rigation Systems . 34. The Sultan maintains wardens and plantations on the Hamran and Kizat systems, uananas - four varieties, and cocoanuts afford the main production and flourish with the abundant water and fertilizer supplied. Other producing crops are limes, guavas, figs, maize and various vegetables. 35. On the water of the nizat system the Sultan lias started growing cane - the small soft variety, and some 10 acres is under crop this season. 36. 'The raost important crop grown on the permanent flow is the sweet potato of which two varieties, one white and one red rooted are seen. The cereal crops used in the well irrigation farming system are also found on tne permanent flow areas. 37* lucerne is grown and is found in association with other perennial crops such as those planted in tne garden areas. Implements and Tillage. 38 . The hoe is used for a good deal of the cultivation on the plain. The plough of simple Arabian type, is drawn by camels - the local humpless cattle are small and have not been adapted for use in the plough. Some Zebu stock imported from Baluchistan by the Bultan provide the sole exception, and these animals are employed for the cultivation of State lands. fertilizers. / 39* fertilizers are regarded as essential for the mainten ance of any standard of production on the land watered by perennial/ flow or irrigation from wells. 40 . / Ben-manure available in large quantities from the seasonal cattle camps and the village cattle yards is used particularly on the land irrigated from draw-wells, hucerne and hhnrra Sorghum are 'the crops on which pen-manure is mainly used./ fish manure supplied as whole dried fish - Indian Sardine speci/es and also the odorous waste from Sardines which have been, rotted down for the producoion of fish oil, is used on the land. It is said that as much as xwenty^fiyaxMariaxTharttsat 8 camel loads weighing about one ton of fish and or fish manure may be used on one acre of intensive cultivation watered from a well on the Bhufar plain. Brices are low this season and 8 loads represents ; an expenditure of out $ IT.T.. 25 jor He.51/- per acre.% w - 7 - 41. Fish i^armre is the mainstay of the cultivator on the Jurbaid as it is in the coastal areas of the Quaiti State. In one respect the cultivator is more fortunately placed than his Quaiti neighbour for he has fairly near at hand the waste products of the considerable sardine fishery of the Mahra Coast, as well as that of the Dhufar fishery. / 42. fwo other sources of fertiliser, cuano and sea-weed are not it seems used on the Jurbaid. In the wuaiti coastal areas intensive use is made of cuano. Hill Cultivation. 43. Small patches of cultivation are seen on the ^ara mountains. I/lany of these patches are on dangerous slopes, uo terracing is seen; plots are small and fenced with piled brush wood cleared from the field. 44. fhis encourages a heavy growth of . rass and weed round about the fence and as a result a fair stop-wash affect is produced. Sorghum and cowpeas are the main crops grown in these enclosed fields. Animal Husbandry. 45 • Classes of Animals rarmed . Cattle of a small unhumped breed are the main source of wealth of the people of the Qara mountains. The cattle are similar in type to those found in Socotra but owing to better conditions they are nearly double the size of the diminutive beasts seen in that mountainous and over-stocked island. They are in spite of a slight thickening above the withers, of the European XBi&amp;LIAhkhX iype. Iheir arrival and survival in this tropical area is a ’natter of conjecture. The nearest indi vinous examples of this race of cattle are probably those in the Levant. It is significant that these European type cattle have survived in an area where average temperatures are over the 70 ° Isotherm, where humid conditions prevail and where ticks and biting flies appear to be abundant. The management of these cattle on the range appears to be satisfactory for the people of the gara mountains are semi-nomadic. Hotational grazin ; is followed and adherence t'o this is influenced by the practice of feeding sardines to the cattle in the dry seasons, it is customary to move the herds irom the hills down to the Jurbaid about the beginning of \ November when the sardines become abundant on the coast. The reserve of grazing on the well watered Jurbaid is then consumed and the cattle obtain a fish ration near at hand. Later the herds are returned to the hills where reserves of hay on the stalk are kept and then the sardines are carried up to the mountains as required by the cattle. 46. A serious limiting actor to cattle keeping in the humid zone^ during the summer is said to be the presence of a biting fly which demands that the cattle be housed in caves with a smudge fire during the day in order to avoid the strike of the fly. The fly attacks humans as well as animals and beduin from the &lt; esert of the north are loud in their objections to the 'fly” country during the rains. 1 was unable to obtain any specimens of the fly” on the occasion of my visit. 47. ery few bulls are maintained. It appears that about one male to every 50 females is the rule. The bull calves are killed off early and a skin covered dummy is used to induce the cow to milk. 4 c: * ^ custom found among the people of the mountains is Vagina blowing as a meais of inducing milk secretion. The people say siia-c once a cow has become accustomed to this practice, she will not let her milk down until the 'Jlafakh' or blowing nas been done. HN' —»'49 * r ^lie ownership of cattle appears to be on a family basis. Like many pastoral people the poorer members of the family roup are helped by the gift or loans of cattle and the poor of the whole community are fiven milk in the season of plenty. As may be expected cattle enter largely into the social life of the people. Numbers are slaughtered on the death of a person and thereafter on the anniversary of a death some sacrifice is generally made, they are used vo pay the bride price, for compensatory payments and for sacrifice or payment on any occasion which nay by its importance, demand such a measure. 50 . I examined many hundreds of cattle and found that very few of them showed any outstanding milk developraent. in act the average appear to be poor. Whether this is due to breed character istics, degeneration or to the lack of proper selection, so common to countries where cattle are regarded as currency, I am unable to say. The quality of the cattle did not by any means reach the standard seen among the Zebu cattle of the Western Aden Protectorate districts, where, owing to an almost constant shortage of fodder, vigorous culling of undesirable animals is practiced and, constant selection for milk in the females and good workin ; qualities in the males is sought. 51. Ghi, clarified butter fat is an important article of trade in bhuiar and from the coast an export; trade is carried on. The output per cow is said to be in the region of 20 pounds annually. This on an estimated 4&gt;^ butter fat percentage would be made from 50 gallons of milk. As in the case of the crop industry so the livestock industry depends to a great deal on the sardine fishery. .ach good cow when well fed will consume several lords of dried fish during the year (price in early November 1947, 3 to 4 M.T. hollars per load of approximately 300 lbs). Settled tribesmen and others on the coast make a point of placing their cattle with the graziers of the hills who in return are allowed fee milk by the owner who for his part takes the increase of the herd and the Ghi which is made, but is responsible for supplying the fish ration to the cows. Zebu Cattle. 52. The Sultan has introduced a number of zebu ploughing oxen from Baluchistan. These animals are used on the State lands. The animals I saw were of fair quality but showed no superiority over the type of South Arabian zebu plough cattle as found in the Aden Protectorate and Yemen. The Sultan nas also a few specimens of another Indian breed in his dairy at Salalah. ^or some reason no progeny has so far resulted the mating of bulls of this breed to local Dhufari cows. Came ls (Dromedaries) . 53. As elsewhere in South Arabia these animals form an essential part of the rural economy. They afford meat and milk to many beduin tribes. They supply work animals for plou hin ; on the Jurbaid and work animals required on the draw-wells as well as transport animals required for the carriage of merchandise and fish inland and the Ghi incense and other products down to the coast. The dry forest and scrub on the lower slopes of the mountains and particularly in the gorges affords suitable browse for camels at certain seasons and this type of range is used by the camel owning people. Beyond the humid zone and across the Qutun and Qarn Shaiba vast areas of steppe-land camel grazings are available. In the time at my disposal I was unable to ascertain the extent to which rotational /grazing and movement of the camel herds affect those who use the humid zone, for a seasonal grazing.G-oats uoats are kept in fair n^bers in the scrub country# To the traveller passing through on a brief visit the numbers appear small in comparison with the available feed to ’which one would expect bhe herds to breed up to under normal conditions. Sheep# 55* Very few sheep were seen on the plains or in the mountains. The humid conditions over most of the area no doubt make conditions unfavourable to sheep husbandry. The scrub and long crass as well as the humid conditions would encourage intestinal parasites and tick borne diseases in the flocks, but to the north of the Qutun and into the borderland country there should be very favourable sheep grazings on the short prass and steppe. Scarcity of water supplies may at present operate against sheep farming, in such areas. nonkeys. 56. A few donkeys are kept by the people and they are used for packwork and for riding. The type seen is the usual African sort with a broad shoulder type. The Sultan has introduced a few good type riding donkeys from Baluchistan and Muscat. Horses. 57• ^ The Sultan maintains a stable of saddle horses at Salalah and has there a number of animals of Arab breed from the Persian Gulf as well as one or two showing Bn lish blood. These animals are maintained on barley imported from Muscat, Lucerne from the plain and hay from the mountains. I was informed that even on the sea-shore these animals suffer from 'fly' trouble during the summer months. CHOP PRQlvUCTIQH. Sugar Cane . 58 . The Sultan is particularly interested in the growing of , sugar cane and the manufacture of su.gar for the use cf 'his State. A special study was made of conditions likely to influence this development and of developments to date in Cane rowing. 55• With the present incomplete development of v?ater supplies it would be unwise to embark on anything more than a small scale project. After full development of water supplies, it should be possible to Have command oi a total of some 4,COO acres from wells, springs and Khors and there should be opportunity for flood irrigation production on 1,000 to 3&gt;000 acres. With the increased irrigation farming, it should be possible to introduce a small sugar cane growing industry to the Jurbaid without interfering with the development of other food producing crops which are needed for consumption in the country. Sugar Ca na Grow ing and Sugar Production at Present . 6 0. Sugar Cane growing and su nr production has for long oecn a part of the economy of the Oman mountains. In Lhufar° there is no recent history of cane growing for the production of sugar ou g a few canes have been grown on the wells for chewing purposes. In the past two years an effort has been made by the Sultan to start soar prod action. This project has been stimulated by the chronic shortage of sugar tliat parts of Muscat ' and ’.Oman have undergone during the recent years. 61. As mentioned already, two varieties of cane are rown. The most popular, a thin ye .low cane is the one which has been sed by the Sultan for sugar production and some 10 acres of land are cropped to this cane in the present season.) JjL) a good variety / ^fr-) riven^water supplies and satisfactory cultivation^ ^ satisiactory production of cane will largely depend on , che amount oi fertilisers v/hicli can be obtained locally# Cane will demand far more .i.ertiliser per acre than the other crops of the coastal area# 72. filere several pressing problems to be decided on before this target can be reached and the result of these investigations will largely determine the profitability of sugar production on the Jurbaid. firstly there is the selection of suitable disease free and disease resistant varieties for the area. Secondly, the determination of satisfactory cultivation measures the manurial requirements of the soil and the adjustment of irrigation practice to meet local conditions for cane rowin • 73• .actors which make up the yield of sugar may be tabulated as follows:- Sucrose per acre# Sucrose per plant. ! Plantes per acre. Juice p gr plant ,—L Per cent, su'c’rose in juice# Weight of plant cut. , L —i Per bent.juice. Wei'ght of individual r- - - 1 cane. Lumber of canes per stool.

Selection of a suitable cane variety will take several seaso is, f irst of all there is the task of importing // viable seed or of seedlings, or of disease free outi;in s then there is the work of growing these introductions in observation plots and in experimental plots to determine their behaviour and production under the conditions of the Jurbaid# fven though this method may appear j_on ; drawn— out and tedious , - while the country is waiting for sugar, it will pay. The dangers of introducing pests and diseases of sugar cane at present unknown to Dhufar are very great am ro a T 4 oid this The import of liable seed of sugar cane or of disease free seedlings or of very small quantities of cuttings certified, free of pests and diseases is to be most stron ;ly recommended. 76. The setting up of a factory to deal with a crop from 500 acres should, I suggest, wait on the selection and proving of a suitable variety which will give not less than 2 tons to the acre of made sugar from plant canes of 11 to 12 months old. &lt;h 7 • tfhile selection is going on soil conditions and cultivation methods should be investigated# Sucrose determinations can be made 1 by laboratory methods and the crops prod -ced from the experimental areas which need not exceed 20 to 50 acres can be disposed of ^ ■I through the present factory run on the Omani system*12 - A. 78• In the intensive system of cane which should be followed on the Jurbaid, oane should bo planted yearly and not ratooaed - that is out and allowed to produce 2 nd, 3 rd or 4 th year crops# fhe system of yearly croppin; with plant canes is almost exclusively followed in Java and other areas of intensive cane cultivation where irrination is practiced# 79• 500 acres of plant cane yielding twenty-five to thirty tons of cane to the acre or say not less than 2 tons of made suyar per acre will need a factory of up to 20 f 0sJ0 tons of grinding capacity or say 353 tons per day for a two months season of 16.6 tons per hour for two shifts of 10 hours oach# 30. At to-day*s price 500 acres of cane producing 1,000 tons of sugar at £38 p&gt;er i;on (Bhufar price is £94 per ton) represents £ 38,000 worth of easily ible produco# afore the war the cost of a factory to deal with such a production would have been of the order of £ 40 , ) k) to £ 50 , &gt;)0 sterlin •;# fo-day tinree times this amovuit would probably be needed to &gt;et up a factory in Bhufar. 81. In considering the various sta ;es which should load up to this development, the following recommendations are iadei- • Sta .el. Period our years, hteploy a sugar-cane plant breeder to select suitable varieties. 1 e should impart Viable seed and disease free seedlin gs of crosses arid possibly disease free cuttings of well-known varieties likely to be found suitable to the conditions of the Jurbaid. fhe person appointed should, if possible, have experience in irrigation farming, and should oe able to make laboratory determinations of sugar yields of the varieties which he is selecting;. He should be fully experienced in the layout and tesin of experiments and the analysis of the results of experiments. oTAm ii. ireriod two years. The start of this second period should coincide with the full development of water supplies, but before bta ;e II is proceeded with, a decision must be taken on the whole economic aspect of sugar rowing in Bhufar. Ihe yields of sugar per acre as determined by experiments must be measured against the figures for the estimated cost of production when the crop is extended to cultivation on a commercial scale, fhe estimated cost per ton of cane of estimated sucrose content must then be considered with estimates for the cost of making sugar in a modern factory of known capacity, to arrive at the cost per ton of made sugar. L‘his final figure of the estimated cost p r ton of made sugar in Bhufar oust be considered in relation to world prices arid trends and the whole problem of markets for sugar in the State of Hus cat and Oman and nei hbouring territories. If it is decided to proceed with the sugar production then in the two year period (1) Selected canes should be taultiplied to raise sufficient material to plant a large proportion of the 50 o acre farm chosen for sugar cane growing. ( 2 ) ihxrchase and erection of factory and plant includin ' light railway orack of approximately 5 miles for easy transport o cane to factory.-12(A)- (j) Appoint factory staff which may perhaps be encased on a seasonal basis from India to work in Dhufar for each crop season of two months. Sta,;e III. Itill production on 500 acres and with full staff (including a sugar chemist) for field and factory and with Plant breeder in attendance for a further four years. ■Purchase of factory and Plant . 02 . J?he tendency in all countries is to centralise sugar production into large factories connected with the cane growing area by railway. This tendency is particularly markedt in the older sugar growing countries such as the West Indies. As a result there is a good chance of purchasing a second hand factory in the West Indies at reasonable prices. It is not suggested that anything but an efficient factory or one capable of modernis ation should be purchased.- 1 &gt; Livestock in Kelation to the Sii/^ar Industry * 83 . The introduction of a satisfactory breed of drau ht oxen for plou 'hin ^ inter-cultivation and haulage on the Jurbaid is advised. Cattle will be needed bo consume the Cane tops and other products of the farming system such as sweet potato© tops, sorghum millet stover and cowpea vines, as well as special fodder crops such as lucerne which will be available and the cattle should be kept in special pens where these waste products and fodders from the fields can be fed. The pen should be bedded with the waste products of the sugar factory such as filter-press cane ashes from the furnace as well as surplus bagasse and trash from the cane fields; this material incorporated with the manure from tne stock will make the pen manure v&amp;iich will be needed in the intensive farming system. 84. As an example of an area somewhat similar in regar^ to temperature and soil type to the Jurbaid, where creat use is made of pen manure from livestock, one may select the island of Barbados in the best Indies. The island is 13°4 horth, the mean annual rainfall is 61 inches and the mean annual temperature is 79 . 8 *F. cultivation is intensive and on the calcareous soils of the island 10 to 40 tons of pen manure is applied oer acre as well as heavy dressings of artificial manure. The avera ;e yield from 30,000 to 40,000 acres of sugar cane is generally 3 tons of made sugar per acre. 85. (a) Permanent flow from springs. The present policy of tapping the spring flows and lining canals should be accelerated. At present there is a very considerable waste of water. Complete control should be possible in due course. (b) IJonsoonal flows from springs. The monsoonal flow from the Sahalnut and.Jirziz is said to be very considerable and provision to carry tiiis seasonal flow in extra channels to be constructed alongside the a^queducts made for the permanent flow is necessary. (c) The lood flow of the Hamran system is said to be of the order of 30 to 40 cu.secs. This system is worthy of a special flood irrigation scheme to divert the flood to lands lying to the South-tCast where summer cereal crops could be raised. 36. Before embarking on this uararan (or the Jirziz) scheme discharge measurements over a few seasons should be obtained. The final scheme requires a weir and lined canals to carry the flow from the hillside where a suitable diversion point has been provisionally selected by Mr. Pradhan Singh, tlie State Engineer. 87. If there is a seasonal flow of 30 to 40 cu.secs. full development of this scheme should permit of 3,000 acres of land being cropped to cereals, pulses, oil-seeds or cotton in the monsoon season. Such an acreage would require lined canals all the way to the field. If unlined canals are used then 1,000 acres will be a more likely figure to accept for annual cropping. Losses of water in unlined canals crossing the Jurbaid'must be very heavy and good examples are alrea Ly at hand in the losses seen from the various spring flows which are partially developed.

Such measures should raise the standard of living of the fine tribes who live with their catula in the Province. Development should also aim at the-14- preservation and improvement of the range on which the herds 89. While the cattle of Dhufar can not be classed as 'European Cattle' they are of the same race or closely alliec. They are most definitely not zebus Uos indicusi. eo ?rom a general consideration of the temperature and hmniditv figures expert cattle breeders with tropical experience would insist tliat Dhufar should keep 2 ebu type cattle and no otaer. in areas to 70 ^anre^eit over zebu cattle have been proved more , .Juropean unhuraped types. 2 ebus can stand thev are less subject to worry from ticks and other biting maec-Co. Tt is Ukei; thattebu cattle could profitably replace ^ Present bread but rreat care must be taken to see that all .he iactors which could go to make a decision on such a replacement ate well established before any large scale effort is attempted. cn in the first place reliable information is required on the ^racters'of thef ocarbreed of cattle is required on the production from an average nerd Ox cows kept the present Qara mountain system. Such information should record 1 . Calves produced per 100 cows. 2. Milk produced per 100 cows and per cow in milk. 3. Butter fat percentages of milk produced. 4 . Survival rate for youn ; stock kept. 5 # Maturity and breeding ages of females. 6 . Length of productive life of females. 7. Weights of animals. 8 . Bood requirements to maintain production (this investigation should take particular note the present custom of feeding fish to cattle in the dry season)• 92. At the same time a similar investigation should b. made on a select herd of Lebu cattle of a type which will give a ^ood mil-v yield of high butter fat content and will raise good steers for beef and for the plough. This zebu herd should oe ^ W1 ° n beduin to run on the same range and in association with tne recorded Dhufari herd. 93 .

Ploughing oxen of the same Jreed ».avo been exported to the Hadhranaut where they have proved tneii vortt at the plough.; ■I96. With the cooperation of the Department of A ricuiture, Aden Protectorate, it should be possible to obtain a number of selected animals of this breed for use on the trial which is su jested. PARMING- IN THE QAHA MQUifTAIHS. farming 97* The preseni^system is unsatisfactory and for the preservation of the country its soil and its productivity, close attention should be paid to this side of the rural economy, fortunately, the :! a*eat traditions of South-west Arabian farming can be easily brought to assist this mountain country where cultivation is still in a primitive state. 9 i. The first effort must be to persuade the farmer to terrace his land. With the abundant limestone at hand, there should be little physical difficulty in the work of terrace making • In the first stages the cultivator should be encouraged uo build stone walls across the land on the contour at 4 ieet vertical intervals. Small stones and soil should then oe piled against the wall to give the stop-wash effect required and radually a level terrace will form behind the stone wall. 99* It is advised that an Agricultural Instructor be recruited from the Aden Protectorate, to demonstrate this work in the Qara mountains. In the first instance, the instructor with a gang of say 10 labourers should lay out demonstrations of terracing on the cultivators fields and later if the people prove cooperative, he could extend his services to advise individual farmers on the layin r out of terraces on their own lands• 100. After a suitable period of demonstration - say five years, the local tribes should be asked to agree to the promul,gation of a law prohibiting the cultivation of any land which has not been adequately protected by terraces. , Terrace farming will give good results. Instead of the farmer scattering his seed on a thin and unstable soil, he will be able to plant in a secure situation where available moisture and fertility can be conserved and developed for the use oi his crops. Terrace farming will discourage the present wasteful system whereby bush is destroyed on steep slopes and the soil bared to erosive influences. At present the danger may pass unnoticed for the areas cultivated are small while land is abundant. Increased pressure of population on the land or a desire for self-sufficiency may alter this and there may be a steady increase in cultivation in the hills. Row is the time to institute improvements and safeguard the land from the evils of soil erosion which is capable of impoverishing the country and its inhabitants if allowed to proceed unchecked. plant nmiomo'nom fob the hills . ^ Citrus should grow well on the hills and at Dahaq at an altitude of 2,000 feet, there are a number of lime trees now wild. The wonderful growth of these trees gives an indication as to the suitability of the area for Oitrus. 1P3&lt;&gt; Planting material of Oitrus varieties could be Conveniently imported by air from Lritrea. It is advised that /small trial plots be established on terraced warden lands from the foothills to the highest areas in the humid zone. 104 . Deciduous --fuits .

Ihis valuable tree produces a— bean useful for human and animal feed, fhe sweet bean can be used for s.jgar production and when yxown in a suitable environment, it is highly productive. 106. Ihe Oarob starts to bear fruit at ten years of An average yield per tree is stated to be as follows 10 Kilograms at 10 years. 20 u at 20 years. 50-70 ” at 25 years. 107 . The tree is well suited to limestone areas and although a native of the 1 editerranean region, it lias become acclimatised ana flourishes in parts of Southern Arabia; it is grown particularly in the lafa’ mountains of the Aden Protectorate. &gt; 108. fhe Carob produces male and female trees and to ensure that the trees bear fruit, it is necessary to graft female stock on to seedling trees. Mesquit (Prosopsis laliflora) . I'his is a valuable fodder tree which produces a sweet edible pod suitable for human and animal feed. It would probably do well on the Northern watershed and its production mi ;ht afford a valuable concentrated feed ^“or the cattle at a time when the range vegetation is unattractive and of low feedin : value. Seed ol Mesquit can be obtained through the Department of Agriculture and forests Khartoum, Suaan. i advise that both the Carob and the Mesquit should receive attention and be thoroughly tried in the Qara mountains. fisheries in Relation to the Rural Economy of Dhufar . fhere is a great need for development in the production of -ish oil and fish meal for fertilisers. At present a wasteful and primitive system of oil extraction by rotting down sardines in stacks and draining the oil from the putrifying mass is the rule. Modem - but simple, methods of preparing clean :c ish oil and a dry and wholesome fish meal could with little difficulty be instituted on the Coast. ihs meal product ir6m lish oil or meal factories could be used i or cattle feeding or for fertiliser and would have a reUv.y sale j.or export. The fish oil produced from such factories is in demand in the leather and other trades. 112. At present considerable quantities of whole fish are used on the land. This is a most wasteful practice but one which is common all along the Couth Arabian coast. The ise of whole fish results in the application of fish oil to the land as well as the fertiliser in the rest of the fish. Oil is of no use to the land, its application is unnecessary and undesirable. I I Simondiura C.P. South Africa Messrs, H.E.7. Pickston/e and Bros. Ltd.,/have supplied the varieties named above to the Department of A triculture, Aden Protectorate.-17- w. v 113• 5‘or the present, fish manure must be considered essential to the farming of the Jurbaid and any development which competes with the local demand for the products of the fishery mi^ht seriously affect the whole economy of the ‘“rovince. x'or this reason, I advise that any development of the sardine industry should aim at the provision of abundant supplies of fish and : ish meal for the needs of the people and their stock and ample fish fertilisers for the land before any export is allowed. On the other hand, it should be possible to develop a large export of oil without detriment to the stock feed and fertiliser requirements of the district. 114* It is most desirable that reliable facts and figures regarding the production of the fishery and the utilisation of the products of the sardine fishery for human consumption stock feeding and fertiliser should be obtained. The fishery is bound up with the fertility of the soil and the growth of crop plants, and provides an important link in the chain of human and animal* nutrition, fisheries can have a profound influence on the rural economy of the r r0 vince. 115• It is understood that the development of the fishery is under consideration by the Sultan who has invited Dr. G.L. Bertram to study the fisheries, and progress in this connection may be expected. COUGLUSIOft. 116* A brief description of the agriculture of the Dhufar xbrovince is given. Recommendations are made for development of irrigation projects, Sugar Gane growing, Sugar production, and farming in the mountain districts while mention has been made of the importance of fisheries to the rural economy. 117. The Province offers considerable scope for agricultural development. The most certain improvements will follow the developraenx of water supplies on the Jurbaid. Other developments outlined will take time and will cost a good deal of money before any definite returns can be expected but these developments are all considered necessary and to a xeat extent the subjects are related. Attention to these problems should help the people of the Province to improve their condition and move forward Yidth—„ an economy which will conserve and develop some of the natural resources with which the Province is favoured.
