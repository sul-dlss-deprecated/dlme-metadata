MT^C representative Teheran has full in Persia and has established that about and fines in equal parts, could be produced monthly in addition to quantity at present required for local civilian needs and such small quantities as M.W.T. and Services already offtake. 2. Price is relatively high: about- £10 par ton f.o.b. Persian Gulf, composed of approx:- £2. 7 cost at mine £2. 4 transport to railway £4.17 rail transport to Gulf the balance consisting of sundry expenses. \ 3« M.W.T. are at present arranging trial shipment of 250 tons to • Basra to test quality-. Their letter to you of 29th December refers. 4. As the main difficulty to be considered is possible influence of coal shipments on turnround of railway trucks on /the Teheran-Gulf line, this matter is now under study to determine .the maximum quantity o.f coal which can be moved South without influencing ttifnround of railway . trucks. • • . • - 5. As coal requirements for Gulf arc sufficiently high to absorb, under conditions as per para 4, nearly all local production, shipment of coal from Persia 1 to other M.E. areas will not come into consideration for time being* . 6. Mining expert has been attached to mines by MESG Teheran and further development dependent on outcome of results as per paras 3 and 4 above. Should results be favourable substantial amount of motor transport to convey coal to railhead,.also relatively minor mining equipment, will have to be provided. 7. Regarding Petroleum Coke. A stock of 120,000 - 200*000 tons exists at Bahrein Island and was recently inspected by our mining expert. There is further a regular production of some 7&gt;000 tons coke per month, which is however not aonstant but dependent on^fluctuating conditions of refining. Specifications 15&gt;600 BTU/lbs, 5% sulphur 0.4;o ash. Difficulty is that bulk of coke in shape of dust and only small percentage friable lumps,, which would hardly withstand transport and handling. 8. Persia has been advised to endeavour to replace imported coke requirements of 150 tons monthly'by petroleum coke but we are doubtful whether this feasible in view of high sulphur content and form. 9. Trial shipment for Egypt of about 500 tons Petroleum Coke from Bahrein at present being arranged. Large briquetting plant exists in Egypt with possible output of 80,000 tons per annum and endeavours will be made to briquette the trial consignment here in order that its suitaHLity may be tested for requirements where the high sulphur content should notJprove prohibitive. 10. Utilization of Bahrein Coke on full scale, however would only be of interest if shipping space was saved thereby. As no more coal is being shipped from U.K. -r U.S.^. at present shipping og coke from Bahrein would have to bo weighed against shipping of coal from India or South Africa. Understand from-M.W.T. representative Cairo that no advantage can bo found in shipping Bahrein coke under such conditions, especially v . . /as</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00032a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/799</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00032a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/799</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 1077/43 'Utilisation of coke stocks in Bahrain'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1943/1943</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-10-23T22:25:15</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (2 folios)</extent><extent>The file's contents are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 4; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file consists of one letter and a note from the Middle East Supply Centre in Cairo.
