There appears to be an inner bundle set onto two parallel wooden sticks.  An outer wrapping envelopes the inner bundle and the sticks. The linens wrappings are medium brown, with various coarseness and tightness of weave. The mummy contains a single bone (possibly bull).\r\nCondition: The mummy is extremely fragile.  Although the form is still intact there are numerous loose, fraying and detached fragments. The horns are not upright but are securely attached.  There are multiple layers of wrapping mostly wound vertically from the head to tail.  Most of the outer wrappings, which appear to surround the inner form and the wooden supports, have been lost or are detached.  The wooden supports are almost completely exposed on the back half of the mummy on both sides.   There appears to be looser and coarser woven linen, but they are possibly unraveled strips of the same material.", "medium": "Reeds, cloth, animal remains (one bone, species unclear)", "dimensions": "6 3/4 \u00d7 2 3/4 \u00d7 9 3/4 in.
