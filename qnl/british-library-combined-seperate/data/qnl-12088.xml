Issues discussed include terms of a concession, technical mining issues and assessments of commercial viability of mining the coal seams and ore.The file contains correspondence with representatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on desired terms for a concession and a draft agreement (ff 6-8) relating to coal. Also discussed in the file are the unsuitable conditions for prospecting, such as the hostile reaction of tribesmen in the Qara mountains.Included in the file is a handwritten letter (folio 35) in Arabic (with English translation on folio 36) from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr] to the Political Agent, Muscat, concerning a possible concession for mining coal. Correspondence (folio 30) from a representative of the Government of Muscat and Oman also discusses the significance of the discoveries by Harry St John Bridger Philby and Bertram Sidney Thomas in Dhofar and their possible connection to the 'gold mines of Ophir'.The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent, Muscat (Trenchard Craven William Fowle); the British Consul, Basrah (Francis Edward Crow); the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Percy Zachariah Cox); the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and the Financial Adviser to the Sultan of Muscat (Reginald George Evelin William Alban).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Coal mining</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dhofar</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000d5#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000d5#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000d5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
