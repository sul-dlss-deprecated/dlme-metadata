            1822, and conveys the Resident's regret that no letters of a more recent date have
            reached him from Bussora [Basra]. It is explained that the Resident desires more up to
            date information concerning the size and movements of Turkish forces in 'Turkish
            Arabia'. It also notes that the Resident has heard news of a Persian victory over
            Turkish forces, and of the commencement of hostilities between Turkey and Russia; he
            remains sceptical over the news, and is awaiting further information from Major George
            Willock at Tabreeze [Tabriz].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054342.0x000081#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
