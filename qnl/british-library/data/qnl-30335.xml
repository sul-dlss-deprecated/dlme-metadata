Pirates . - With reference to paragraph 11 of the Persian Gulf Intelligence report for July, while at Khor Jarama on 27th August, two Bedouins volunteered the information that the pirate Chakir bin Murad had gone to Baraimi (Baraimi is a somewhat notorious Oasis situated about 24° 30’ IT, 55° 30’ E. The ov/nership of this Oasis is divided between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia and very little control is exercised over it by either owner). In view of the trouble that has been talien to attempt to bring this nan to justice, it was considered that this information was worth confirming. Accordingly H.M.S. “Shoreham ;i made a call at As Suwaik on passage from Khor Jarama to Elphinstone Inlet. The Wall was sent for on arrival and as on the previous visit denied all knowledge of Chakir but it was subsequently ascertained from the local Customs officer that Chakir had left for an unknown destination inland, together with his family and bodyguard shortly after u 3horeham’s u visit on 18th July. The attitude of the Wali serves to confirm the previous suspicion that he has a hand in the game. This matter has been reported to the Political authorities. ( S. IT. 0.

Minister, Tehran, to Eushire, dated 8th April, 1938. No. 24. IMPORTANT (to Bushire only). Addressed to Bushire, No. 24; repeated to Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, No. 1; and to Government of India, No. 27. Copy 'by hag to Foreign Office, P.L. No. 138. Following for Acting Political Resident: On the 6th April, Head of European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after reference to assurance that Iranian warships would not interfere with Arab dhows on the High Seas which was reported in Mr. Seymour’s telegram to the Foreign Office No. 75 of the 15th June, 1937, asked that suitable measures might be taken against two individuals who had been guilty of piracy and slave-trading in the Persian Guif. Otherwise the Iranian Navy would, he said, be obliged to take action itself. Names and descriptions of individuals concerned are as follows:- (a) Chakir Murad Baluch (also known as Chakir Adamfuroush or Murcheh). Description: tall, black beard, turned up moustaches, sword scar on right cheek, age about 40, generally wears Baluch This man is stated to have a boat and 50-60 men and dress. arms. He usually sails by night lying up by day on the Coast of Oman. Usual base is between Ru’us-al-Jibal, Muscat and He attacks small trading boats, robs them and carries/ Has Musandam.carries off males of suitable age for sale as slaves on coast of Oman. (b) Mustafa Khan Ealuch (description not given) who recently carried off 18 persons from the Southern Iranian coast (presumably coast near mouth of Gulf) and sold them in the market of Iswaik (sic, possibly Suwaiq is meant). With proceeds he bought rifles at Debai. 2. Iranian Government also ask that note should be taken of name of third pirate, Subhan son of Nur Mohammad, stated to be guilty of similar activities on the coast of Oman. He is being pursued by authorities in Iranian Baluchistan where he now is and Iranian Government do not ask for any action against him at present. 3. Action of Iranian Government in thus bringing to notice of His Majesty's Legation reports of piracy and slave-trading in the Gulf is to be welcomed. I trust that it will be possible to make very early enquiries into the reports and to take any steps which may prove necessary to suppress these activities. I should be grateful to be informed as soon as possible by telegraph of the results of your enquiries. BUTLER.w s CONFIDENTIAL. No. 0/261 ol 1936. . i .
