She had taken part in student protests in 1972 in Alexandria and participated in other movements during the mid-1970s.  Learning about the Tahrir protests from her children (who had been in-formed through Facebook), she participated in the 18 days of demonstrations, whose sense of community across diverse social classes, religions and ages she recalls.  ###### also describes the clashes between protesters and security forces, having witnessed  the attacks on protesters praying on Kasr El Nil bridge and a young man getting shot in the eye which resulted in her be-ing sprayed with blood. The interviewee comments on the safety situation and the efforts of young protestors to protect public property like the Egyptian Museum in Tahir Square.  She also tells of her participation in a women’s march as well as the June and July 2013 protests in Tahrir Square.  Also covered are her views on the Egyptian media coverage of the revolution up to the 2013 protests, and on Egyptian politics from President Mubarak’s removal through President Morsi’s ouster and the 2014 presidential elections.</dc:description><dc:date>2014-05-12</dc:date><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:identifier>20140512</dc:identifier><dc:relation>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution</dc:relation><dc:source>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution oral histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2012, American University in Cairo.
