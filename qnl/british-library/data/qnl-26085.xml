Sultan Abdullah bin Mohsin, Representative of the Balihaf sultan. 90 .Th© Upper ‘Aulaqi and ’Audhali Sultans, who had been Invited, were unavoidably absent, and the Hadhrarai and Bu'si sheikhs were kept away by a tribal feud* The Lower Yaf*a Sultan, and the Chiefs of th© Hausatta, Maflahi, sections of Upper Yaf *a were not invited as they are at present under a ban from Aden, as reported in paragraphs 5172 and 3190 of the Political Intelligence Summary dated 6th and 20th February respectively. 3s The Conference was formally opened by me on 1st April, After the ceremony the Officer Commanding British Forces in Aden and I, with our respective staffs, lunched with His Highness the sultan of Lahej, A political camp had been established about 6 miles South of Lahej and on 5rd April I went by car to this camp and gave separate interviews to each ruling Chief or his representative, 4. During the week discussions took place at Lahft,) between the various Chiefs under the Chairmans ip of His Highness the Sultan of LaheJ, and under the guidance and with the advice of officers of my Political staff. The following tribal dispates were success fully settled, either partially or completely:- 1, • lawi - ;iteifei dispute 2. Alawi - Hauahabi do, 3* Haushabi - Amiri do. 4. Haushabi - Fadhli do. 5. Fadhli - Lower Aulaqi dispute !6, Amiri - Quteibi do, 5. iOn the afternoon of 6th April, I went to LaheJ, accompanied by the Officer Commanding British ! ForcesQ h &gt; 0 Forces In Aden, to close the Conference. At the conclusion of the closing ceremony Hie Highness gave a garden party in the palace grounds to the Chiefs and their retainers at which the Officer Commanding British Forces in Aden, and 1 together with our respective staffs were present. $, The Conference proceedings were fallowed by the opening by me of the Aden Protectorate College for the Sons and relations of Chiefs, a brief account of which was given in paragraph 3260 of the Political Intelligence Summary for the week ending 10th April 1935. 7. As on previous occasions, the satisfactory conduct of the Conference was largely due to the tact and hospi tality of His Highness the Sultan of LaheJ. The support and assistance accorded to me by the Officer Commanding British Forces in Aden, and his staff were of the greatest value and I take this opportunity of recording my appreciation of them. 8. I enclose copies of my addresses to the Chiefs at the opening and closing of the Conference, and of my address at the opening of the College. I also enclose a translation of a Loyal Address to His Majesty the King from the Chiefs who were present at the Conference. I am despatching the Address to you separately. X have, etc. (Signed) B.B, BJSILLT Resident etc* Hie Majesty *s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London.LAHEJ ADDiiKS3 . 1st April 1935 Your Highness, Sultan Sir Abdul Karim bin Fadiil, Sultans and Chiefs, I am very glad to have this opportunity of again meeting representative Chiefs from certain parts the the Aden Protectorate, and I feel sure that they are % garteful to the hospitality of His Highness Sultan sir Abdul Karim which enables the Conference once more to be held at Lahej. It is about three years since the last Conference was held, and I regret that since then Sultan Muhsln bin All of the Haushabi tribe, who attended the last Conference, has died. He has been succeeded by Sultan Sarur bin Muhammad, whose presence we welcome to-day* I regret also the deaths of Sheikh Motahar Mana, the Saqladi, who has been succeeded by his grandson aheik Muhammad Muqbil Motahar, and of sheikh Abdul Habi bin Ali Hashir al Alawi, who has been succeeded by h e ikh l uhsin Al i Ha ah ir . 2, Three months ago our host, His Highness Sultan Sir Abdul Karim, was honoured by His ?4ajesty the King, who created him an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and saint George on account of his excellent qualities as a Ruler, and his long and firm friendship with the British Government and His constant loyalty to His Majesty the King. I am sure that all the Sultans and Chiefs who are here will join me in congratulating His Highness on his receipt of this Honour, which has given great pleasure to his friends in Aden\ Aden and in the Protectorate. 3. Several ©vents affecting the Aden Protectorate have occurred since the last Conference, and the most important and happiest of these is the establishment of friendly relations between His Majesty*s Government and the Government of the Yemen. After long negotiations a treaty was signed at San*a on the 11th February 1934 (26th Shawwal, 1352) between His Majesty »s Government and His Majesty the King of the Yemen. Before the treaty was signed, the King of the Yemen withdrew his troops from the Audhali country and fro® the district of Sanah in the territory of the Amir of Dhala*, and released all prisoners and hostages whom he held from the Audhali country and from Beihan. He also removed the prohibition which he had imposed on trad© by land between his territory and the Aden Protectorate, the terms of the treaty the frontier between the Yemen and the Protectorate is to remain as it was on the date of the signature for the period that the treaty remains in force, that is to say for forty years, and during this period of forty years His Majesty*s Government and the Government of the Yemen are to come to a mutual and friendly agreement with regard to the permanent boundary. X trust that the relations of friendship and confidence, which have thus been established between the British Government and the King of the Yemen, will be everlasting, and that the people of the Protectorate will, in future, regard their neighbours in the Yemen as their friends, and peace and goodwill will thereby be ensured between all Arabs in this part of the Arabian peninsula. M.. The&amp; 4* The conclusion of the Treaty of San’a marks an important point in the affairs of the Aden Protector ate. Before the adjustment of our relations with the j*ing of the Yemen It was necessary for us to give much attention to the protection of tribal frontiers. These are now no longer in danger, and the Chiefs of the Aden Protectorate should now devote their thoughts to the peaceful development and progress of their own countries. If they will do so, the British Government will be ready to help them. I have often spoken to you of the necessity of making the trade routes in the Protectorate safe for travellers and for the conveyance of merchandise. zi 1 visited the Yemen last year I saw that Hie K&amp;Jesty th-3 Imam had established complete security in his territory, and that caravans could travel from place to place without escort in complete safety both by day and by night. Unfortunately conditions within the Protectorate border have been very different, and caravans and travellers in the Protectorate have been liable to attack and to illegal collections of money beyond those that are legally authorised to be taken. On account of the danger on the roads most of the trade between Aden and the Yemen has been diverted to the see route with consequent loss to the Chiefs and people of the l- rot act orate. For some years before the signing of the Treaty the Imam prohibited all land trade from the ismen through the Protectorate on the ground that his subjects were not safe on our side of the border. hen • V he at last removed his prohibition as a result of the treaty negotiatione, it was incumbent upon the Aden 1 \ \ authorities and upon the Chiefs, through whose terriiori i } \ V | thethe sain roads pass, to take strong measures to remove the evils of insecurity. Unfortunately some of the first caravans to pass along the road between Dhala ! and Aden after the re-opening of the frontier were molested on their way by tribesmen living near the road, and it became necessary to punish those concerned by bombing from the air* The main roads between Aden and the Yemen are now much more secure, but travellers have still been liable to interference from time to time, This state of affairs must be stopped, and His Highness the Sultan of Lahej has been using his Lahej Trained Forces for this purpose* In order that other Chiefs, through whose countries the main roads pass, may be better able to co-operate in suppressing outrages on \ the roads I have proposed that they should establish tribal guards who will patrol the roads and support the authority of their Chiefs against malefactors. Government are prepared to assist in the formation of these tribal guards by giving arms and ammunition and some financial assistance for them, and by allowing a Political officer, Captain Hamilton, to assist the Chiefs concerned in the organisation and training of the guards. Arms and ammunition for this purpose cm be given by Government only on condition that they ar© used by the Chiefs solely for arming his guards and not for giving away, for selling, or for any other object. I feel sure that the formation of these tribal guards will be of great value to the Chiefs who adopt the scheme as well as to Government, and to travellers and traders. A commencement of this experiment has been made in the Haushabi country, where Sultan Sarur has already establishedestablished a body of tribal guards with the help of Captain Hamilton, and 1 hope that other Chiefs will follow this example. The trade routes between Aden and the Yemen are the most important, but there are other principal trade routes leading from Aden through Abyan and through dhuqra to the eastern parts of the protectorate, and these should be made safe also. Security on the roads will bring increased prosperity to the people of the Protectorate, and I hope that they and their Chiefs will fully recognise its importance, and will themselves take action to ensure it, so that there will no longer be any necessity for the Government to enforce it by bombing. 5* It has been necessary on some occasions to inflict the punishment by bombing for another reason, and that is firing at aircraft from the ground. The Boyal Air Force is the guardian of the Protectorate, and defends the independence of the tribes under British protection. I feel sure that the chiefs and most of the people of the Protectorate realise this and look upon the .ir Force as their friend, but in some cases some evilly disposed persons in certain places have behaved as though the Air Force were their enemy, and have fired shots at pasting aeroplanes. Government cannot permit such a thing to happen without punishment, and 1 hope that there will be no more Instance of such wrong and foolish action. I realise that these incidents have usually been due to inter-tribal feuds and jealousies rather than to direct hostility to Government, but this is not a valid excuse, for inter- tri tai quarrels must not be allowed to involve th© relations and conduct of the tribes towards Government. 6. The6, The tribes of the Aden Protectorate are now safe from external aggression, and they shotald make use of this safety for improving the condition of their people, which can b© done only if they maintain peace and put an end to their internal feuds and their quarrels with their neighbours. The British Oovemment will continue to protect and to help Chiefs who devote themselves to this object, and it is necessary for Chiefs and tribes on their side to observe strictly their treaties with the British Oovernment. I regret that recently the Muflahi and Mausata sections of the Upper Tafa 1 !® have broken their treaty obligations with the British Government by refusing admittance to two British Officers into their country. Under the terms of their treaties their tribesmen are allowed free admittance into Aden, and for their part they must, under the same terms, give free admittance to British subjects into their country. It is therefore not permissible for them to prevent British Officers from passing through their territories, and the action of the Muflahi and Mausata tribe an en is a breach of their treaties, which have consequently been suspended until they are prepared to honour them. I realise that the Chiefs of these two sections did not wish to break their treaties, but they must be held responsible for the bad acts of their tribesmen, and they must find means to bring their tribesmen to reason if they wish to retain th&lt; friend ship of the British Government and to remain under its protection against foreign interference. At present their treaties are under suspension, but there is a risk that the British Government may cancel their treaties altogether&amp; altogether if these Chiefs and their tribesmen continue to fail to observe their conditions. I hope therefore that the Chiefs concerned will consider this mtter seriously and will exert themselves to see that they and their tribesmen fulfil their treaty obligations in future. 7. One of the principle causes of dissension between tribes and between Chiefs and their Aqils and tribesmen has been quarrels about arms and ammunition that are issued by Government to the Chiefs. In many cases the Chiefs pass on these munitions to others as bribes for their good behaviour, and sometimes they sell them. This is not the object for which Government have issued these arms, and because they have been mis used in this way, and also because there is no longer the same need for defence against external aggression, the Government intend largely to diminish the issue of arms and ammunition, except for purposes which they approve, such as the institution of tribal guards. 8. It is the policy of Government to promote peace in the Protectorate, and Government hope to advance the welfare of the Chiefs and of their tribes by providing education for the sons and relatives of Chiefs, and by giving medical education and establishing dispensaries. \ ith these objects in view the Government have now established a special College in Aden, in which boys from the Protectorate will be educated. This College Is being organised by a Political Officer, Mr. Ingrams, who has had experience in such matters, with a special staff of masters, who will look after the teaching and&amp; teaching and welfare of the boys. This is a very worthy object which I hope that the Chiefs will appreciate. Mr. Ingrains will explain to you the character and organisation of this new School in greater detail, and I propose to open the College next week, when I hope that the Sultans and Chiefs who have come to this Conference will attend the ceremony and will see the College for themselves. I trust that they will then see the advantages that it will provide, and that they will give it their support. 9. r ith regard to medical education, a number of young men from certain parts of the Protectorate have \ already received elementary medical instruction from Doctor Petrie at Sheikh Othman, and I hope that many more will do the sane. Kis Highness the Sultan of Lahej set an example to other Chiefs by the establish ment some years ago of a most beneficial medical dispen sary at Lahej. This good example has been followed by the establishment of dispensaries at Shuqra, Dhala’ \ and Museimlr, in which the Fadhli Sultan, the Amir of Dhala’ and the Haushabi Sultan take a praiseworthy interest. I hope that these institutions will be multiplied, for there are many diseases from which people suffer in the Protectorate, such as fevers, eye complaints and ulcers, which could often be cured If they were dealt with quickly in their own countries by men with some medical knowledge. If this were done it would not be necessary for so many people to travel all the way to the Civil Hospital at Aden or to the Keith \ Falconer Mission Hospital at Sheikh Othraan for treatment&gt; and much suffering and loss might be prevented. I hope \ therefore a \ \therefore that the Sultans and Chiefs of the Protector ate will give their attention to this matter also. 10. In conclusion I wish to remind you that the present year is an especially auspicious one for the BritisSh Empire, for during it will be celebrated a Jubilee in honour of the completion of 25 years of the reign of our Great and Gracious King, George the Eifth. Our King is a noble example to all Rulers , both great and small, for he devotes his thoughts and his time to the welfare of his subjects and of those under his protection. He is a mighty Ruler, to whom many lands in all parts of the Vorld owe allegiance, and throughout his dominions he is greatly loved and respected on account of his high character and his good works. Ve propose to have festivities in Aden in this year in his honour, and we propose also to collect money on this occasion to help the hospital in Aden and to feed the poor, because we know that the King desires that good * should be done everywhere for the poor and for the sick. I hope that some of the Sultans and Chiefs who are here to-day will be able to be present at the celebrations in Aden next month, and that some of you, who can afford to do so, will give contributions for the good objects that I have mentioned. 11. I hope to see you individually in my Camp at Subar on the day after to-morrow, and in the meantime I will leave you to consultation and discussion under the Chairman ship of His Highness Sultan Sir Abdul Karim and with the advice and help of Political Officers of ray staff, and I trust that you will take this opportunity to effectto effect the settlement of differences and to promote your mutual friendships amongst yourselves and your loyal co-operation with the policy of the British Government, whose object it is to safeguard your interests to advance the prosperity of yourselves and your tribesmen.ADDRESS OLOSItiG THE LAHEJ CONFERENCE 1935 6th April 1935 f V / -■«*- a r* 4 ii Yo\xr Highness Sultan Sir Abdul Karim Sultans, Chiefs and gentlemen, i. ! %J i 'S‘ l i^C'5 ■ ii«H! The Conference which T opened on Monday last will close to-day, and I am glad to know that it has served an useful purpose in affording an opportunity for the discussion and settlement of a number of inter tribal disputes, and that under the Chairmanship of His Highness the Sultan of Lahej and with the help of Political Officers, the Chiefs concerned have made use of this opportunity and have adjusted a number of their outstanding disagreements. I hope that these settle- rasnts will be enduring, and will be productive of good relations and peaceful conditions between neighbour ing tribes in the Protectorate. £. i'r. Ingrams has described to you the organisa tion and aims of the new College for the sons of Protectorate Chiefs, which I intend to open, and which, I hope, you will all see on Monday next. I am glad to hear that some of you have subscribed towards the cost of the College and that others intend to do so, and I thank those of you who are giving this support. I hope that you will also remember what T told you last Monday about the commemoration of the Silver Jubilee of His Majesty the King by the collection of funds in aid of the Civil Hospital in Aden and other charitable objects, and I repeat my request that those of you who can afford to do so will assist this worthy object. 3. I am3. I am glad to learn that the Sultana and Chiefs assembled at this Conference have decided to send a loyal Address to His Majesty the King on the occasion of his Jubilee, and it will give me great pleasure to send your Address to London for submission to His Majesty. 4. In conclusion I congratulate you all on the success that has attended this Conference, and I desire particularly to thank His Highness Sultan Sir Abdul Karim for his hospitality and for his assistance in settling tribal disputes. 5. I now close this Conference, and express my earnest hope that its results will be of permanent benefit to you, and to the welfare of the tribes and people in the Protectorate whom you represent.Your Highness, Ladies and Gentlemen, e are very glad to have the occasion of welcoming here today the Chiefs who have been attending the Lahej Conference, and of giving them this opportunity of making themselves acquainted with the surroundings in which we hope to educate their sons. It is more than thirty years since the idea of founding this school originated and it Is a project which I myself have long desired to see fulfilled. I have long felt that the best contribution which we could make to the advancement of the Protectorate would be a college in which we could give to the future rulers of the country and to the sons of prominent persons in the Protectorate some of the advantages of education which w/e enjoy ourselves. Some attempt has been made to meet this need in the past by our accepting a number of the children of chiefs and others as pupils in the Government School in Aden, and with the foundation of this college this arrangement comes to an end. It was not a really satisfactory arrangement for the education given them was not that best fitted to the needs of their after life. The education in the Government school is naturally adapted to the after needs of the sons of the towns people of Aden and not to those of Protectorate Chiefs. There was another disadvantage about the arrangement and that was that the children being away from parental control were liable to contract bad habits owing to the possibility of contact with the undesirable company found in every large cosmopolitan town. In theseIn these new surround infs in one of the best and healthiest situations in Aden it will be possible to give full attention to the teaching of subjects more likely to be of use to them in after life and more particularly to the formation of their character. Great care and attention will also be paid to the health of the boys in the college, and apart from the provision of facilities for healthy recreation, regular visits will be paid by Dr. Variava who in addition to his ordinary duties has accepted the appointment of Medical Officer to the college. The curriculum includes a very thorough programme of religious studies and apart from the learn ing of the Holy Quran, the precepts of religion and religious history, a mosque will be provided where the boys will be expected to perform their religious duties daily. Emphasis is being laid on the necessity of teaching the boys that the spirit of religion must be brought Into every action of their daily life. It gives me much pleasure to state that His Highness the Sultan of Lahej, the Fadhli Sultan and the Aqrabi Sheikh have already shewn a practical interest in the scheme and particularly in the building of the mosque by making donations of Rs.500 on the part of His Highness and Hs.lOQ each from the other two chiefs. I trust that this afternoon the other chiefs present will feel able to contribute what they can afford. The names of all those contributir^Rs.50 or more will be inscribed on a marble tablet in the mosque as a remembrance of their names to future generations. Apart from religion the other subjects to be taught in the college are the Arabic language, arithmetic, history0 history, geography, nature study, hygiene, elementary agriculture, and English. The older boys will also be given some simple instruction in the privileges and duties of citizenship, the art of Government, and elementary medicine. You will no doubt have already noticed that an amply sized playground has been provided where football, cricket, and the games of the country will be played. In addition the boys will be given a course of physical training. A swimming pool will be constructed shortly and I hope that it will not be long before it is possible to introduce scouting. Considerable care is being taken in the selec tion of the staff, and men of high character who are qualified teachers are being recruited. The officer who has been selected to fill the Post of usher is already well known in the Protectorate and has given many years of distinguished service to His Majesty in the Yemen Infantry and the Aden Protectorate Levies. His duties are primarily the maintenance of discipline among the boys and the domestic management of the college. The motto of the college, chosen from the Holy Q.uran, is 'Verily God ordaineth justice and kindness', and the instilling of these two virtues is considered on the primary objects of the training of the boys. I think you will all agree that the Aden Protectorate owes a deep debt of gratitude to His Majesty’s Government for the provision of the funds necessary for the institution and maintenance of the College, to Colonel Lake, Mr. Champion and LIr.Ingrams for devising /for devisin£ and elaborating the scheme for the organisation of the college which has been adopted, and to the Secretary of State for the Colonies and his Vdvisory Committee on Education for their approval and encouragement of the project. Later in the afternoon after we have seen the buildings and grounds of the college, it will be my pleasant duty, together with His Highness the Sultan of Lahej and the other Chiefs who have been attending the Lahej Conference, to plant trees in commemoration of this day. We lack in Aden the fertile soil and the running water of many parts of the Protectorate and it is always difficult to grow trees in this barren soil. v e are however grateful to His Highness the Sultan of Lahej for providing the soil in which the trees are to be planted, and 1 feel sure that if their surroundings do not prove suitable to them it will not be for want of the care which I am sure the staff and boys of the college will give them. It now gives me great pleasure formally to declare this college to be open, and I earnestly hope that this endeavour will be blessed with the success that it deserves.To The stay of mighty Kings and the refuge of honourable Sultans, the source of justice, and the spring of equity, His Majesty George V of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the British dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the faith, Umperor of India, may the Almighty God strengthen the influence of Your Majesty in every district and province and perpetuate the glory, blessings and happiness of your dynasty. After presentation of the respect and honour due, we the undersigned Chiefs of the Aden Protectorate assembled in Conference at Lahej, do by these presents \ V. desire to offer our heartfelt congratulations, and to express our sincere loyalty and best wishes, to your Illustrious Majesty on this the occasion of your Silver Jubilee on the fulfilment of £5 years from the accession of your Majesty to the throne of Great Britain. e lift up our hands to Almighty God in supplication for the continuance of your reign and the strengthening of your rule over all the corners of the world with blessings, guidance and victory to your Majesty in long life and health.

We, Chiefs of tribes and districts in the Aden Protectorate, Signatories of thg Lahej Pact of the 6th April, 1929, have entered into solemn undertakings at Lahej to do our utmost to effect settlements in nnd to avoid disputes and disturbances between us or between our tribesmen, and will use our utmost endeavours to carry out the following arrangements :—• 1. The Chiefs’ Conference, that assembles at Lahej shall supervise such arbitrations as shall be referred to it in respect of disputes between tubes in their various territories and shall solve such cases as shall have been willingly postponed and referred to it for solution by the arbitrators mentioned hereafter. 2. Chiefs who are m dispute one with another shall do their utmost to settle the dispute between them. If they fail (to effect such a settlement) they shall refer it to Arbitrators who shall do their duty accordingly, and shall com- munidate their award to the Chiefs’ Assembly for information, and a copy thereof shall be sent to the Resident and Commander-in-Chief, Aden. 3. In the event of a dispute arising between the tribes of Upper Yafa , their respective Chiefs shall endeavour to effect a settlement between them direct. If they are unsuccessful therein, they shall by agreement appoint Arbi trators in accordance with custom from among the Chiefs or selected Mansabs or influential Aqils to effect the settlement of such dispute. Similarly in the event of a dispute between the Upper and Lowei Aulaqis, both parties shall choose Arbitrators for its settlement. With regard to the disputes existing between : Ahl Fadhl and Lower Yafa’, Ahl Fadhl and the Haushabis, The Haushabis and the Amir, Ahl Quteibi and Ahl Ali, they (the respective Chiefs) shall meet together and appoint Arbitrators from among themselves in their (respective) territories for the settlement (of these disputes). If such procedure is not possible, the settlement of these disputes shall be undertaken at Lahej. . , 4. It shall be the duty of the Arbitrators m the event of a serious dispute and disburbance of the peace on the roads between two neighbouring Chiefs and their (respective) tribes firstlv to arrange an immediate truce between the dis- putants, and to provide for its renewal until such time as they shall make them Arbitration award regarding such disputes. And they (the Arbitrators) shal make a report thereon to the Chiefs’ Assembly for record and reference to 5. Arbitrators may take guarantees or pledges in the form of hostages, oi animals, &amp;c., for the execution of theii awards. . . „ 6. The above procedure will be adopted as between neighbouring Chiefs an(1 InUaJf of internal disputes in which a Chief ag his own tn b es are_ con cerned, the settlement of such disputes shall be m the hands of the C hief.

The abstention of these Chiefs was due to the pressure of local affairs in their territories, and had no political significance* 2. I attach hereto copies of my addresses to the Chiefs at the opening and the closing of the Conference* The iiules of Procedure for the settlement of inter-tribal disputes which the Chiefs agreed to adopt prescribe the manner in which truces are to be arranged and arbitrations put in hand, the Chiefs 1 Assembly acting primarily as a Supervisory body. The form in which the rules have been drawn up is largely the work of the Chiefs themselves, and it is satisfactory that they should have made this combined effort to implement their obligations under the Xahej Fact of 1929 to co-operate in the settlement of their disputes. 1 decided that it was preferable to accept their draft almost as it stood rather than to attempt to amend it in the interest of brevity and greater precision. 3* I propose in the new financial year to initiate a scheme for the preliminary training of about sixteen young selected tribe&lt;vnen in first-aid and elementary hygiene* The Medical Officer in charge of the Keith Falconer Mission hosoital HIS MAJESTY'S SiiOHSTABY OF STATS FOB THiS OOLONIiiS , LONDON.hospital has consented to conduct the courses of instruction. 4. The periodic meetings of the Chiefs of the western portion of the -Protectorate were initiated by Sir Stewart Symes with the intention of perpetuating and developing the policy which he embodied in the Lahej Pact. They are justified if they are effective in combating the centrifugal tendencies of the tribes and in educating the Chiefs in a sense of their individual responsibilities and of the importance of co-operation* I feel that they are being successful in these respects, and that although progress is slow it is real* The Chiefs appear to be learning to realise the value of friendly discussion of matters that affect their common interests, and to appreciate the desirability of finding means to adjust their mutual differences* 6. The opportunity was taken of the presence of the Upper Iafa*i Chiefs at lahej to receive from them a considered statement of their views in regard to their treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. I shall IV , A&gt; tvU address you on this subject in the near future in a separate despatch* ?* After closing the Conference on the 3rd March, I opened the new Dispensary at Lahej at the request of His Highness the Sultan and in the presence of the Chiefs,and of a number of local notables* The establishment of this Dispensary will be dealt with in a separate despatch. 8. As on previous occasions the satisfactory conduct of the Conference was due to the tact and hospitality of His Highness the Sultan of Lahej, and to the successful organisation of Mr.Champion, Protectorate Secretary, and Colonel Lake, Political Officer. The support and assistance accorded to me by the Officer Commanding, British Forces in Aden, and his staff were of the greatest value and 1 take this opportunity of recording my appreciation of them, I iicive etc* (3SD) B.H.aSILKf. ftiSIiCTF iTC.*LAH'U AOMloi, X our High® sb 11sn oil ^bctui. j&amp;jtxFXia o in i- &amp;idli2» • bultans and Chiefs, it gives me great pleasure to meet you and to see that so many 01 you, have come to attend this 3rd Oonierence at Lahaj. Z % As you know, the first of these Conferences was summoned on the initiative of my predecessor, Sir Stewart Cymes, who believed that the best interests of the Chiefs and people of the Protectorate would be served by periodic meetings at which matters of common interest can be discussed and decided. He continually sought to impress upon you the value ox mutual co-operation and in order to achieve this purpose he devised the instrument of the Lahej Pact, which you have ail signed, and which I trust that you will all endeavour to carry out both in the letter and in the spirit. If you do so, those Conferences will be of benefit to you all and they xorm a convenient means for you collectively to moat the representatives of the Government, under whose protection you live. 3. it is due to the hospitality of your host, His Highness Sultan Sir Abdul Karim that these meetings have taken place in three successive years at Lahej, and 1 take this opportunity to express my appreciation of his kindness in again throwing open his palace and His Guest Houses for the accommodation of the members of the Conference, for which, i am sure, you are all grateful to him. 4. Shortly before your last meeting the death occurred of a member of the Assembly who was greatly respected, viz. Sultan Munasoar bin All, the Lower AulaqiAulaqi Sultan, may God hav^ mercy on him. And we welcome here his successor oultan Aidrus bin Ali. 5. i wish now to reier briefly to the events that have occurred in the Protectorate since your last meeting and to the policy oi His majesty f s Government. 6. There has been no serious trouble on the borders with the exception of the Zeidi encroachment into the Al ’Ain district of Beihan. ^his aggression was new and unprovoked, arid the Imam of the lemon withdrew his troops on receipt of strong representations from His Majesty’s Government. The frontier at this point was thus effectively protected, but I regret that the imam has continued his occupation of certain other districts within the borders of the Protectorate and also continues to hold a number of hostages from certain of your tribes. 7. The Imam has recently re-opened negotiations for a treaty with the British Government, by whom his proposals are now being considered, and I hope that a way may be found ior settling ali outstanding difficulties with him* It is satisfactory to record that the attitude of the Imam’s officials beyond the border towards inter-tribal disputes involving Iemeni with Protectorate tribes has been friendly and helpful. I am glad to say that personal relations with the Imam have been friendly as has been exemplified by the recent despatch oi a Medical Mission from Aden to Taia and the visit of Colonel Lake to Lana’ at the invitation of the Imam, who toQ£ this opportunity to return to his home a relative oi one of the Protectorate Chi-is who had been a hostage in his hands. 8. Within the Protectorate there have bean no serious disturbances, but inter-tribal feuds have unfortunately on some occasions interfered with the safety1 safety of caravans and peaceful travellers on the main trade routes to and from Aden* As you know, the independence of tha Ohio is and people of the Protectorate is ensured by the British Government, and the Government regards it as an essential condition of this protection that the Chiefs and tribes concerned should maintain complete security for peaceful travellers on the routes to and from Aden. It has twice been necessary to inflict punishment on transgressors of this rule. On the first occasion the village of Mair was bombed after due warning had been given to enable the inhabitants to leave it, and a line was iniiieted on the village of Harur. On tha second occasion a xina was imposed on the Dubeini tribe and hostages were tutien from it as a punishment for an outrage on a caravan from Aden. The policy of Government on this question was explained to you all ; ' } &lt;)A in the letter that 1 sent to you in May last and 1 hope that it will not be necessary to take further \ action of this nature in the coming year. ^ \ i \ 9, Officers from my staff and officers ofjthe B.A.f. have paid a number of visits to various places ; \ \ in the Protectorate, and 1 am glad that their /\ \ •i ' t\ ■ \ \ reception has reflected the friendly relations that have also been vary pleased to receive a number of you tine eeuuuu li J. uu, uveevei, * w« that cartaia Chi sis ha»o surprised me by the importunity oi their requests, particularly in respect oi the issue oi arias and ammunition, i much deplore the attitude oi jealousy oi each other that is displayed by certain Chieis in this connection. And exist between you and His Majesty's Government. ' 1I wish you all to understand that iriau the rising the issue of anus and ammunition to individual Chiefs 1 consider their individual needs rather than the balance of one Chief's receipts against those of another. 10. in this regard 1 must also warn you oi the danger to yourselves and to your authority as Chiefs, oi too wide a distribution oi your armament among your Aqils. ?ho deep and narrow rivir is strong; but wide and shallow waters make much noise with little effect. 11. 1 have been pleased to hear of settlements that have been made in a number oi internal or inter tribal disputes notably between the Amir of Bhala' and the dhairis, between the haqibs qi &amp;ausatt&amp; and Shaib, between sections of the busi tribe. 1 am also pleased to observe an improvement in conditions of security in Abyan, although the further delay of the Fadhli and Lower Yafai Sultans in bringing to a satisfactory conclusion the settlmaht that they had begun still constitutes a danger to security in that region and prevents its proper development. The Quteibi and Alawi dheites are being assisted by Bis Highness dir Abdul Aurim towards a settlement of their disputes; 1 hope that this will be made as soon as possible and 1 must remind them ox the determination of Government to safeguard peaceful trailic on the Lahej-Bhala’ road, ^he Mayasir and Ahl Hasan are disturbed and harrassed by internal dissension, and the co-operation of those of you who have influence over them or friendship with thorn is very necessary to bring their parrels to un end. Id. You have now assembled at this 3rd Conference of Chiais in order once again to meet together and to discuss with one another the general welfare of your tribes and of the Protectorate. Let me remind you of your1 your obligations under the Lahej Fact of 1929, which oblige you, firstly to co-operate with His Majesty's Gofenment xor external defence• secondly to organise by comon action the security and improvement oi comunications. thirdly to co-operate in the settlement of quarrels between your tribesmen. fourthly to confer on other matters of mutual interest. 13. The basis of your discussions and meetings must be co-operation, and what brings you together should be your own realisation that co-operation is for your own good and for the good of your tribes. 1 should iiae to see you displaying more keenness in these matters, and to hear you yourselves bring forward suggestions for your common good that might be discussed by you all. For ii these conferences are to produce their best results it must be mainly by your own sincere efforts to maxe them successful and valuable. 14. There are for discussion during this week the following subjects, and any others oi common concern that you may wish to propose. (a) Acquisition from His Majesty»s Government of arms and ammunition for your internal and external needs. (b) ^he formation of a Commit tee for the control of Arbitrations between disputant tribes and sections. (c) specific inter-tribul disputes and their settlement. (d) The instruction in medical work, under our supervision of certain candidates to be nominated by you from among your tribes. His Highness 5ir Abdul Karim has set an admiraolo example by instituting a dispensary in Lahej in the charge of a qualified doctor who has been obtained from India. His Highness is bearing the whole charge of the institution and has erected an excellent building for Hie dispensary here in Lahej.I trust that this enterprise will meet with the s coess that it deserves, and that it will be of benefit to the sick and the poor of His Highnes8 , s territory. 15* on Tuesday ne*t 1 shall welcome each of you individually at my Camp at Oubar at times that will be aotUiod to you, where &gt;ou ma) make any personal representations to me. 16. On '’bursday next i shall meet you all again in this room formally to close the Assembly, and 1 trust that in these ensuing days, under the Chairmanship of His Highness 3ir Jidul Karim and with the advice and assistance oi my stall, your discussions will result in the cementing oi friendships and in the furtherance of that good will and co-operation that are essential to your prosperity.lour Hi,Mess Jultaa Jir ^bdui Karki radhl, Jultans, and Chieis. We meet together again to consider the subjects that you have been discussing in conierence under the Chairmanship of His Highness .jultan &gt;ir Abdul Karim. As regards th $ organisation of methods for the ^uioK and arnica 4e settlement of your inter-tribal disputes 1 am very glad to learn that you have draum up Auies ol Procedure which you have given oath to follow. 1 note that you desire that these jUles should be considered as experimental, and I agree that this should be so. i realise that your various customs and circumstances make the establishment of permanent unchanging Buies a matter oi great dilxiculty and your wish to establish Buies that can be changed from timf 3 to time by the agreement of all oi you is 1 thin* a wise one. But 1 would impress on you the important consideration that the fact that these Pules are experimental does not mean that they can be disregarded, ^ou have agreed to follow them, and they ought to be followed until they are amended or altered by your common consent. I congratulate you on having framed them and 1 hope that their loyal fulfilment by all of you will have the happiest results. iou have discussed with my representative the question oi your receipt ox armament from me in ^den, and I am glad to learn that you have understood and appreciated the procedure that 1 have ordered to be adoptedadopted In the future in this respect. This procedure is briefly as follcms:- (a) issues are divided into 4 categories;- i. Free ior frontier defence, ii. Free for personal use. iii. Free for standing garrisons. i\r. On pa-, mat ior internal s eourity. (b) Applications by Ohiofs lor armament will be made once a year only^ and will specify ahe categories under which armament is requested. (c) Applications may be made by Chiefs at intermediate times, but only in circumstances 01 serious and extreme urgency f which must be xully explained in the application. (d) Issues will be mad© to recognised Chiefs only While you may all be sure that 1 consider your periodical re quests for armament with thi careful understanding that they deserve, you must also remember that times have changed, and that those are days at peace. lou mast therefore expect that I shall gradually and progressively reduce the quantities of armament that will be issued to you, and you must therefore be all the more cautious and sparing in distributing it among your Aq*Is. lou have also considered the training of certain of your young men in elementary medical knowledge and I hope soon to arrange these courses of instruction. Without your active support and encouragement the value of this training may easily be lost, but if you will assist and encourage the work ox these young men in our countries 1 am sure that it will prove to be a great blessing to your people. dome oi you, have discussed with one another and with His Highness Duitan 3ir Abdul Karim certain important inter-tribal disputes that have been a source of uinhaginess and loss to the tribesmen* 1 am glad to hear that the Amir of Dhala and the Haushabi SultanSultan are now in agreement, and that the Amir and the Upper *afa Chieis have Battled their disputes. It is also satisfactory that the qoteibi and Alawi Shaikhs have agreed to co-operate. But I regret that the i'adhli and Lower lufai iiultaafo have not yet completed a Settlement with each other. i sincerely hope that the oarly and satisfactory settlement of all such disputes will remove the reproach that your independence is a cause of dissension among you, and 1 trust that in future you will ensure the peace and prosperity of the Protectorate by mutual forbearance and co-operation. Lastly, you have met together once more in friendship, and have discussed and agreed upon several important matters. This in itself illustrates the value of your conference^ and has set a new seal upon yjur u idertatings under the Lahej Pact. 1 now close this conference with my sincere good wishes for your well-being ani for the prosperity of your tribes. And in the name of you all 1 thank our host His Highness hultan Sir Abdul Karim again for so ably presiding at your discussions and for his hospitality in our entertainment.s &lt; t / ■- / n ——— \ ''ivzTH 0 1614 19 31 _ % TiiE Ri3« % So* 35.

The Resideiacy, Aden^*™ ! 9 •'S 1 •w-' 4 f /? rz, 1122 17th December 1930. My Lord, I have the honour to report that a meeting of Chiefs from the Protectorate was organized at Lahej during the week beginning on Monday, the 8th instant. The proceedings were similar to those reported in my despatch No.57, dated 10th April 1929, c&lt;nd all Chiefs mentioned in that despatch were present with, in addition. Chiefs from the Audhaii, Aulaqi and Aqrabi tribes. Thus the meeting was fully representative of the western part of this Protectorate- i 8. I enclose a copy of my address to the Chiefs at their Session on the 9th instant. Oppor tunities occurred during the week for discussions about, Inter al.i.a, Frontier intelligence and protection, zoils and public security on the caravan routes, Entertainment of suoordinate Chiefs and the education of their sons at Aden. There were also meetings between interested parties with a neutral chairman either the Sultan of Lahej or a British political officer - to discuss a number of inter-tribal disputes -hich are or are likely to be causes of disorder. Chile these debates were usually conducted in a sensible way it was evident in several instances that a final settlement would be difficult to obtain immediately and without the exercise of compulsion in some form. This difficulty is indeed inherent m the political conditions of the Protectorate; in i thethe pseudo-independent status of the Chiefs, and in our policy of avoiding administrative acts. It would seem that we have reached a new phase in our relations with the Chiefs. We have retained their good-will. We have secured their - certainly more than nominal - acceptance of the principles of mutual co-operation and peaceful relations. But the problem of how to translate these principles into practice in every case requires to be solved. Shortly it resolves itself into the questions of how and by whom compulsion may be exerted against a refractory tribal unit. Bombing by our air-planes - which, it is now realized, can be used effectually - must clearly be a last, and very rare resort. We can exert pressure on an individual Chief or his tribesmen by suspension of stipends and special privileges, by refusing access to Aden and other markets etc. But a means of compulsion - to bridge the hiatus between stoppage of minor benefits and hostile action by air - may be necessary to deal with certain cases. I have suggested tentatively to several of the leading Chiefs that these - intermediary - means might occasionally be provided by tribal combinations, operating with our consent and support, against a defaulting tribe or section; and experimental action on these lines may be undertaken by the Abdali, Amiri and Haushabi chiefs against certain hill—men who have committed offences against public security on the Dhala-Lahej road. Apart from its evident value in establishing contac. and promoting friendly intercourse, perhaps the mostthe most satisfactory outcome of this (second) Conference of Chiefs has been the evidences of their recognition of the need for corporate action, and of their readiness to examine means of overcoming the practical difficulties of their situation. 3. The i§ading Chiefs of the Upper Yafa tribe were present at Lahej but time did not admit of detailed discussion of the matters referred to in your despatch of 1st December 1930. I informed them that their existing treaties would be terminated and I they have agreed to come to Aden this week to discuss the question of their future relations with Government. 4. As on the last occasion, the Sultan of Lahej made admirable arrangements for the housing and entertainment of the visiting Chiefs and their followers, some 400 in number. I wish also to express my gratitude for the help given by the Officer Commanding British Forces at Aden in providing transport and escorts, and also for an airplane display which delighted all present at a party in the Sultan^ garden at Lahej on the loth instant. I have, etc., (Signed) G.S. SBIES, RESIDE!;! ETC.LAHEJ ADDRESS. Your Highness and Chiefs. I need hardly tell you nhat a great pleasure it is to me to be present at this - the second - Assembly of a number of representative chiefs from the western part of the Aden Protectorate, and I take this early opportunity to express to Sultan Abd-elDKarim our thanks for having enabled us to meet together under these very pleasant conditions and on Protectorate soil, the proper meeting place, I feel, for Arab chiefs who are bound together for purposes of mutual co-operation by their Pact signed here 18 months ago and by their treaties with His Majesty’s Government. I should like, with your permission, briefly to mention some of the more important events affecting the Protectorate which have happened since our last conference. Firstly, as regards Yemen affairs. His Highness the Imam, as you ail know, was engaged with a revolt in the Tihama which was not suppressed until last Autumn when the principal Zaranik chiefs tendered their submission. I may mention that applications for assistance made to me by them and other chiefs were firmly refused, and it was made clear that it is not the policy of His Majesty*s Government to interfere in any way with the domestic affairs of the Yemen. His Highness the Imam has alsoalso been preoccupied with the local economic situation which, reflecting financial depression all over the world, is still very difficult, more recently, it is reported, he has been concerned with developments in the north where King Ibn Saud has strengthened his control over the Government of Asir. Despite occasional rumours of hostile preparations, there has been no sign of aggresive action directed from SANA against any part of the territory under the high Protection of His majesty*s Government. This, as affording evidence of His Highness*s good-mil and recognition of the present state of affairs on the frontiers, is satisfactory. On the other hand protracted negotiations, conducted by letters between Aden and Sana, shewed that the Imam was still unwilling to give the clear and absolute assurances for the integrity of districts cf chiefs under British Protection which His majesty*s Government - careful of your interests and of their treatv obligations - deemed indispensible. The Imam has been notified that without these assurances His Majesty*s Government are not prepared to grant the treaty he desires, and further, while anxious not to disturb present peaceful relations, hold themselves at liberty to take such measures as they may consider necessary to safe-guard the territories under their protection. The attention of His Highness was also called to the hostages from the Protectorate - of which a nominal list was sent to him - who are still forcibly detained in the Yemen* It is much to be hoped that the impropriety of retaining these unfortunateunfortunate persons will not be realised and that they will be allowed to return to their homes. On the frontiers, a reported threat of Zeidi intrusion into the Beihan region has not matured. Several minor episodes between Yemeni tribesmen and Ahl Shaib, Audhali, Musabein and Haushabi have caused anxiety. In one or two instances the co- operation of local Yemen officials to prevent the spread of disorders was invited with satisfactory results. In the protectorate we have to lament the deaths of two notable chiefs, Sultan MANSUR Bin G-HALI3 of the &amp;athiri who died whilst on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and, more recently, of Sultan L1UNA3SAR Bin ALI of the Lower Aulaci tribe: also of 3haikh YASLAM 3AHUWEIS, an officer of His Maj esty 1 s forces at Aden; and of Amir SALEH SA*D of BAR AL Amir, a trusted lieutenant of the Sultan of Lahej. For one reason or another I have found it impossible personally to visit as many parts of the Protectorate as 1 should have liked to, but during the period, I made' journeys by sea to Socotra and Luka11a and also had the pleasure of making an extensive tour of parts of the Fadhli territory and to the residence of Sultan Aidrus at A1 Qara. Officers of the Air Force have made many flights over the Protectorate and have taken photographs which have enabled us to correct our maps and added to our knowledge of the geographical features of the country, especially of the Hadhramaut and Upper Yafa regions. Efforts have been made to establish new landing groundsgrounds for use on a new coastal air-route and also to facilitate communication with chiefs in the Interior. There have been a number of internal tribal disorders - in the Amiri country in July of last year, in the Fadhli country, among the Subehi sections, among the Haushabi and iotaibi tribesmen. These disturbances in so far as they involve blood-shed and embittered relations are a source of weakness to the tribes concerned and - so far as I can judge - benefit no one. The Arabic proverb that a house divided against itself may become a ruin is clearly applicable to many of these cases. Of more serious inter-tribal disagreements there is still a regrettably long list which it should be t h e earnest endeavour of all enlightened and public spirited chiefs to reduce in number. Notably, the disputes bet?«ieen the Lower Yafa and sections of the Fad.hli tribes, between Fadhli and Haushabi, between Qotaibi and Alawi, between Amiri and Haushabi tribesmen, and between Lhambari and Haushabi are ones which it is in the interests of the tribes concerned and of the territory as a whole to settle with the least possible delay. For this purpose it is required to adopt no new or foreign procedure but the old familiar Arab methods of conference and arbitration between the contending parties. Reliable arbitrators are happily not lacking in the territory - your host, Sultan Abd-el-Karim (of Lahej), has rendered notable services in that capacity - and the influence of Government will always be exerted in favour of a just settlement of difficult issues. But conference and arbitration are ineffec tive,ineffective, especially in disputes between different tribe's, unless there exists in each tribe a central authority capable of representing the tribe as a whole and commanding the obedience of all its sections. This central authority may be composed of a single chief or a council of chiefs - according to the requirements and traditions of individual tribes - but in the absence of such authority it is very difficult to ensure the proper conduct of internal tribal affairs and to put the relations of a tribe with its neighbours and with the Protecting Power on a satisfactory basis. Fortunately the nucleus of a central authority is present in most of the tribes of this Protectorate. Unfortunately its influence - and yours- has in some cases been weakened by personal jealousies among leaders or dissensions amcng their tribesmen. These jealousies and dissensions are the direct cause of many of the evils from which you suffer and are, perhaps, the chief obstacles to the better organization of the territory, which is so much to be desired. You may have many advantages. An independent status. The good-will of a great and civilized Power. Aden is at your doors with its modern and well-equipped port and its opportunities » for lucrative employment; its markets which are open to all; its hospitals - 6Q% of whose patients come from the Protectorate and are treated free - and its schools.
