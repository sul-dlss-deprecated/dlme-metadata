This date was taken in the Award as the first occasion on which the United States authorities entered into contact with the Island.

Goniiaential . ^ITEHALL, 3 • W • 1. 14tii February i93o. Dear Walker, I am sorry to hayls been so long in replying to your letter of the 24th January on the question whether the Bahrein Islands are within the British Empire for the purposes of the Import Duties Act, 193a, hut we thought it well to go into tne question, which, as you will see from what follows is one of some little delicacy and difficulty, fully with thd Foreign Office. 2, The definition of 'The British Empire' in Section 21 of the Import Duties Act, 1932, is, of course, a definition of the British Empire for the purposes of this Act and not for general purposes and the question at issue is merely whether Bahrein is or is not covered hy any of the words of tnis definition section. The only woras 'by which it could be covered ; if it were covered at all, are the words 'territories under His IvBjesty's Protection'. 3/ GiV. Walker, Esq., Solicitor's Office, Custom House, E• C» 3.- 2 - 3, ihe position lb tnat under treaties concludeci with the Rulers oi Bahrein the sheikn of Bahrein has no relations with any power other than His Majesty's Government and His IV^jesty's Government deal with lorei^n powers ove!r any questions which arise in relation to Bahrein and have also undertaken certain obligations to protect the territories of the sheikh from foreign aggression. As regards the internal government of his territory the sheikh is left full independence, except that jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners is exercised hy His Majesty, who is represented in Bahrein hy a Political Agent. Though it must he recognised that the expression 'territories under His Ivfe,jesty 1 s protection'is hela to cover territories such as the Malay States, Sarawak, Brunei and Zanzibar &gt; where there is a native ruler who enjoys independence in the matter of internal government 'of his territories in which His Majesty does not directly exercise jurisdiction except over foreigners and where from the formal point of view the position is rather similar to that of Bahrein, nevertheless there are grounds for distinguishing Bahrein from those territories- In the first place, the measure of control exercised in fact by His Majesty's Government in the other/- 3 - i other territories mentioned above is greater than in Bahrein, and in the second place^ there are political difficulties which would he caused hy regarding Bahrein as covered hy these words in this Act, which ao not apply in the case of the other territories mentioned. For political reasons it nas heen deemed expedient in communications to forei^i governments to stress the independence of Bahrein. Apart from this, the Ruler of Bahrein would prohahly take exception to the inclusion of his territories as part of the British Empire, even under a purely statutory definition of the British Empire for a particular purpose, the niceties of which he would never understand. In these circumstances, although from the point of view of strict international law it would he correct to regard Bahrein as a territory under His Majesty's protection, it aoes not necessarily follow that Bahrein should he regarded as coming under these words in this particular Act of Parliament, and the view might he taken that the connection with Bahrein is in practice so loose that it should not he regarding as coming within the intention of Parliament in enacting this section and we would therefore suggest that the Board of Customs should/. 4 - should act on the view that Bahrein is not covered hy the section. If the ruling of the customs in this sense were challen^Qd the (Question mi^ht, of course, come before a courts which would then have to decide - the natter on the 1 'basis of such iniormation as was officially communicated to the court on hehalf of the Crown. 4, the position in regard to Koweit and the Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast is the same as tnat in regard to Bahrein, as described ahove. The sultanate of Muscat and Oman is, however, in a wholly different position ana though His tejesty's Government exercise a particular influence there and protect nationals of the sultanate in foreign countries, the sultan is still free to enter into direct relations witn other powers and therefore even from the point of view of strict international law his territories would not he covered hy the expression 'territories under His tojesty's protection' and a fortiori not covered hy this expression in an Act of Parliament of the Jnited Kingdom. Yours sincerely, . J.G. latthwaite.p.2i.583/35. SOLICiiOii' 3 OFFICE, /~N H#.Mt CUSTOMS AND EXCISE, LONDON, E* Ct 3. ^4tji January 1935. Dear Laithwaite, A question has arisen whether the Bahrein Islands are within the British Empire for the purposes of the Import Duties Act, 1932. section El defines the expression 'British Empire' as meaning;- 'His Lajesty's dominions outsiae the United Kingdom (incluaing all parts of India), territories under Hio i.xajesty T s protection, territories in respect of which a mandate of the League of Nations is being exercised hy the Government of any dominion within the meaning of the statute of Westminster, 1951, and any territory in respect of which a mandate of the League of Nations is heing exercised by the Government of the United Kingdom and to whicn section five of this Act has been declared by Order in Council to apply as If it were a territory under His tejesty 1 s protection.' I understand tnat certain protection is afforded to the Islands under a Treaty witn tne Government of India, which is represented by a political agent, and the question whether tnis amounts to His iviajesty's protection within the meaning of the above quoted definition appears to depend upon what, in fact, is the nature of the protection enjoyed. I believe that you were good enough to say that you would let me have your opinion on the ^ matter, ana I should be very grateful if you would do so. If it is not too mucn trouble, It would be very useful to have your views on the other places mentioned, namely, Kaweit, Muscat, &amp;c. Yours sincerely, (3d.) C.V. WALKER. J.G.

CONFIDENTIAL. , &gt; Section lt [E 38/4/91] No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received Januai-y 2.) India Office, January 1, 1935. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th November relative to the contingency of the Persian Government referring its claims to Bahrein, Tamb or Abu Musa to the League of Nations. 2. Sir Samuel Hoare notes that the matter is now regarded as less urgent, since the Persian Government have shown no desire to bring these claims before the Council of the League for decision. He doubts whether any good purpose would be served at this stage by discussing in any great detail the instructions which should be given to the British representative if the Persian Government should take such a step at some future time. Much would evidently depend on the circumstances in which the hypothetical case arose, and the general political situation at the time. If Persia committed an act of aggression and then complained of the measures taken to resist it, there would be a clear issue on a concrete case. If, on the other hand, Persia sought to bring her claims in the abstract before the Council, Sir Samuel Hoare has not suggested that, even in this event, it would be possible or desirable to prevent the Council being seized of the question, but he considers that it would be important, at an early stage of the proceedings, to explain the independent status of Bahrein, or the Arab State concerned, and to point out that there is no reason why its independence of Persia should lead to a rupture or endanger peace unless Persia committed an act of aggression. 3.' As regards the nature of the proceedings before the Council, Sir Samuel Hoare notes the three possible courses described in paragraph 7 of your letter.' For the reasons indicated in paragraph 4 of the India Office letter of the 8th November, he considers that it would be impossible for His Majesty's Govern ment to agree to the first course, namely, a special agreement between the parties to submit .the case to the jurisdiction of the International Court. He is aware that His Majesty's Government are bound to carry out decisions in cases voluntarily submitted to the court. But thej are also precluded by long-standing engage ments to the Sheikh of Ba^rrein, and by their own interests and regard for their i^'uTation for good faith, from carrying out a decision that Bahrein should be surrendered to Persia. It seems clear, therefore, that His Majesty's Government ought to avoid taking any risk (however negligible it may appear) of placing themselves in a position in which they would be faced by an insoluble conflict of obligations. For this reason he suggests that the first alternative must in any event be ruled out. 4. In either of the other alternatives the Council would still have to arrive at i ts o\^a c oncrusion after eitiier asking the court for an advisory opinion or seeking the advice of a committee of jurists. It seems highly improbable that the Council, which would naturally take account of political as well as other considerations, would arrive at a unanimous conclusion in favour of Persia. Even in this most unlikely event, however, it appears that the consequences under the relevant^ articles of the Covenant would be far less serious than that of an actual judicial, and undoubtedly binding, decision by the International Court in favour of Persia on a case voluntarily submitted to its jurisdiction. But the Secretary of State is not prepared at this stage to express any final opinion as to the detailed tactics to be adopted by His Majesty's Government should thev be faced by either of these two alternatives, since, as indicated in paragraph 2 above, it appears to him to be premature to enter into further detailed discussion of this question in the absence of a concrete case, and without foreknowledge of the circumstances and general political situation at the time. 5.

Iran should occupy Bahrain Islanas with the force of bayonets as Germany occupieu Ilhine, Japan Manchuria and Italy ^byssinia witu the force of bayonets. The established right of Iran from every point of view and from any side is clear. Numerous articles which have constantly becnpiblished in tnis ptp r for the last few years onward established proofs on the subject which the readers remember and there is no doubt and hestitation about it. The Imperial 'Government of Iran who consiaer the said Islanas as an inseparable part of the Empire ciiu not wr.nt to occupy theia with tne force of bayonets as tney did in other parts of Iran such as Khuzistan, Baluchistan, Luristan etcetera which had separated on account of the disinterest of the authorities of the bla^k time of ajar and in every side there was a Government ana a leader. The only object of the Imperial Government was to settle the question of Bahrain in a peaceful ana friendly way. It is regretted that an important matter has causeu the delay of this question and that is the Britisn policy in the Persian Gulf and the Inaian Ocean. The British Government, when started iiJU years ago to expend their colonial/-2. colonial influence in India aid not miss any opportunity in adopting any measures to strengthening tnose factors which would cause their success, also they fully enaeaTonred to take rctions against those problems which were not ensuring their bucccsh . This is the reason why we see all countries anu waters situateu oetiveeu Britain and Inuia have becowe more or less uiiUi-x the influence and protection of Britain, ihe Kiangh (English Channel) ,Pacific Ocean, Gibraltar have come under the domination of the British. The British .&gt;iavul influence in the Mediterranean Lea is even more than those powers which are situated on the coast of this sea. In Jgjptian water, Suez Canal, Rea :,ea, Bao el Fandab, there exists no foreign iniiuencc but the British. The domination of this naval government in tue 'Ira^i coast and the Arabian Teninsula is extraoiainar^. And it is for this only that Britain tried from tne beginning and is trying to extena their influence on the Persian Gulf waters in order to bring tne i^lanus ana places situated between Arabia, 'Iraq and Inaian waters under their control. In the past the then Govemment of Iran who had no news even of tne capital now coula it be possible for her to know about the distant places, of the country. The Bri tish(Government;were aoin- what ever they liked in our waters. Their warships used to anchor group by group in the waters of the southern ports s and no one could dare ask what tnese snips uoing in our waters. I reme .ber in v .hcn I xt-s in Busaire there appeared at nights trom the miaale oi ^nt se^ a rrand illumination whicn in comparison with/dimried li^ht of Bus^ire was quite grand and ma ^^nificsnt. i asked/-&gt;v asked a friend of nine froa wnere this illumination was and he replied that those were British snips which had anchored on these sides, and had given the sea such beauty and magnificence. This wrs the stale oi oui waitjra then. By ana by the page was turned and the conditions changed, respite the expectation of powers seeking for colonies there appeared a leader and rescuer ^ho was able to give life to the soulless Irai^, protecting our national interests and affairs in the interior oi trie coui iiy fc-iid abroad. Gradually he put an end to the tribal chitfdoas of the past and the farthest opots of the country became under the control of the Central Government. The Parsian Gulf islands also joined the mother of the country one alter another. The Bahrain Isipnus vhich oii^ of Gulf inlands Hi.d inseparable part oi Iran wer« expecteo to become u-.der the control of Iran but it is regretted that the British have not yet s^reea to desist from their colonial intrigues, i ^rora one side they ure adhering to their treaties concluded with the ; haikhs appointeu by themselves ana nave taken these torn papers as their documentary proof »nd with these documents they hold themselves as protectors of the islands, tiieir inttrects and Shaikhs. The more ridiculous thin: to mention is the Britisn intrigues towaras countries which are neighbours of Iran, that is, that Bahrain is independent; it is considered(only under the British protectionj nence they may exchange consular and diplomatic questions with it. The messages of a f w days ftf^o staled that lue ^iraji Government expect to have a political relation with Bahrain ialfends and to exciuintje consular officers. In other words all protests of the imperial Governement tc® &gt;3 4. tJae League of Nations tna tue last diplomatic and friencily measures of Iran have provtd fruitless. The British try to brinf;, as soon as possible, Baiirain daianas under their complete control. It is obvious that the I/aperial government of Iran, under instructions of our crownec ftitner, v ;as desirous to have a peaceful policy ?.nd to settle its political difficulties in a friendly way. It was for this reason that they adhered to legal means and prociucea tne case before the League of Itations and in the meanwhile correspondence had been e changed between tne Irapernl Government and the British Government. Bat it seems that our peaceful way has been construed as weakness ana inability otuerwise there ^ould have been some effect to it. The frienaly and pe cefui manner nas always ^ood effect in international policy out in tne meantime it might bring aboutextraordinary dangerous injuries. For example, after the Great ..ar and tne victory of tne lilies, Italy who considereu herself a partner in tut w&amp;r booties, trieu her best to obtain from the said war booties her snsire or at least a part of it but could not succeed. Because Italy which »t tnat time wfs confronted with a ran jg of internal difficulties and even the tribt.l chiefs were so powerful as to conquer it at any moment, had no power to bring her rightful requests into effect unci no one, therefor attended to her statement, .lien the prst time was over and Italy was strengthened under the leadership and aictatorship of Musolinni, the nations still were not prepared to enter into a peaceful way with her.

V /e have now had occasion to look into this question again, and have come to the conclusion that the political difficulties to which Laithwaite referred as likely to 'be caused by regarding Bahrein (or the other Sheikhdoms) as covered by the words 'territories under His Majesty^s protection' in the Act do not any longer exist. V/e do not, tnereiore, in existing circumstances, desire to suggest that the Board of Customs should act on the view that the Sheikhdoms are not covered hy the Section. 'H1 0 3.

In case this is so, we think it may 'be useful to give you the following information regarding the relevant treaties with the Sheikhdoms# U. Bahrein* Article 3 of the treaty of 1861 states;- 'The British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury 'by sea upon Bahrein.... or its dependencies'. Bahrein heing a collection of islands, this clearly constitutes protection. 5. Shargah and the other Trucial Sheikhdoms. Article 10 of the Treaty of 1820 with these Sheikhs states 'If any shall attack them /I .e. the ships of the Sheikhs/ the British Government shall take notice of it.' This in effect means protection by sea (though not by land). 6. Koweit. In 191U a letter was sent to the Sheikh in which he was given an assurance that 'Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection'. Thus, as regards Kov/eit, the position is quite clear. 7. We also have Agreements, dated I892, with Bahrein / and the Trucial Sheikhdoms whereby they agreed (l) not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any other Power than the British Government:(2) not to receive the agents of any other Government: and (3) not to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of their territories save to the British Government. Thus His Majesty's Government have exclusive control of the foreign relations of all these Sheikhdoms, and consequently international responsibility for their affairs. 8. It may perhaps 'be felt that the provisions of the treaties, combined with the de facto position in which His Majesty^ Government find themselves in the Gulf (which would necessitate intervention in any major crisis affecting the safety and peace of the Sheikhdoms) point towards the inclusion of the Sheikhdoms under the phrase 'territories under His Majesty's protection' in the Act.

Sir, With reference to a certain trading agreement with American interests under which 'the whole of the British Empire' 1 is reserved for this company, the question has arisen as to whether or not the Bahrein Islands in the Persian Gulf officially constitute a part of the British Empre. Atlases which we have consulted show the Islands as a British Possession, and gazetteers deacrlbe them as being a British Protectorate administered by a Political Resident appointed by the Government of India. It would be appreciated if the India Office (or other Department of His Majesty^ Government) would advise us as to the status of Bahrein Islands, and whether we would be strictly correct in maintaining that they are a part of the Bri tish Empire.

BUSHIRE R^SIDENnvl No../.T*r* /fl'yn. CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS —i I The history of the question of the Bahrain Islands was reviewed In an article published In the current number of 'Relazioni Internazlonall M . The article opened with a reference to Great Britain's traditional policy of bringing under her control centres or zones of particular strategic or economic Interest In the Near East. After the war, the formation of new States or the strengthening of those already in existence had created a widespread movement against British positions and had Induced England to adopt an attitude of watchful defence against revisionist aspirations. The various stages of the Bahrain Islands question were then recalled, and the article ended with the statement that the problem had not emerged from the stage of platonic protests and had not become so grave as to render its immediate settlement a matter of urgency. In spite of this, Iran's 'potentially anti- British' attitude might exercise a considerable Influence on the developments of Near Eastern policy.

A parallel exists in the case of British officials visiting Bushire from Bahrain who on account of the Persian claim to Bahrain are unable to produce travel documents which are valid in the eyes of the Persian authorities. It has now been arranged that such officials should be granted cartificate b stating their identity and business by a 'competent British authori ty* and the Political A^ent Bahrain has also been asked to give this Consulate-General prior notice of the arrival ol such officials so that the Persian authorities can be warned beforehand. 4. On the analogy of the above I would suggest that a t British military person, el visiting Bushire by sea should bring with them certificates from the Head^uartei s.

Dear Harrison As stated on the telephone, there have been two recent references to Bahrain in the Persian press. The first of these appeared on the 7th January in Darya, which is one of the organs of the Tudeh Party. The paper maintained that Bahrain belonged to I^rsia and that the British Goverment had, by implication, accepted in 1935 Persian sovereignty over the islands. It did not want the Persian people to feel that the British Liovermient had any territorial designs on Persia. If for war purposes foreign troops were stationed in various parts of Persia, including Bahrain, it believed that these troops would evacuate Bahrain within 6 months after the end of the war as provided by the Tripartite treaty. It then went on to ask the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs how Persian authority was exercised in Bahrain. It mentioned the importance of Bahrain to Great Britain as a station for Ijixperial Airways (sic) on the route to India. uarya was suppressed a day or two later because cf a particularly virulent attack on this country. Its place was then taken by Miday-i-Haqiqat which, on the 11th January, returned to the charge, saying that Bahrain was an inseparable part of Persia, that the British Govemnent had violated Persia s rights over the islands, and that the agreements between the Shaikh of Bahrain and the American Oil Canpany were illegal. Yours sincerely. (Sgd.) L. Lockhart.Oopy (8 113/113/91) Ifti TH8 HI8TCKY OF THE BAlli -.AIli ISLANDS As the Persian Government renews its elsim to the Bshrsin Islands from time to time, it may be of some interest briefly to review the history of these islsn^s in order to see to what extent that Government can justify their case on purely historical grounds. * The islands have been inhabited aince prehistoric times, as is clear from the numerous tumuli or burial places which are to be seen on the island of Manama. If we are to accept as correct Ihe identification of Tilwun or Dilmun with Bahrain, the earliest known fact about the islsnds is their capture by the Meaopotamian King Sargon in or about 2672 B.C. (thia Ssrgon is not to be confused with his much Ister Assyrian namesske, who reigned from 722 to 705 B.C.). Vbether or not the Phoeniciana or acme kindred race were the people who inhabited the islsnds in those remote times is an unaolved problem. Though there was doubtless commercial intercourse between the people of Bahrain and Persia in Sumerian and Achaexnenian time a, it does not appear that Persia acquired any sovereign rights over the islands until the reign of Ardashir, the first Saaanian monarch (226-2U1 A.D.). Sasanian control was, however, short-lived, and waa not revived until the time of Shapur II (310-379 A.D.)• That king, enraged by raids carried out by Bahrainia on hie territories, headed an expedition to Bahrain, whore he wreaked a terrible vengeance. Thereafter, for over three centuries, Bahrain, as an appanage of the great province of Fare, formed part of the Sasanian empire. Soon after the Muslim Arabs had overthrown the Sasanian Monarchy that is to say, about the middle of the 7th century A .D., they conquered Bahrain and imposed their new faith on the inhabitants, just aa they had done in Peraia. For the next 300 yeara Bahrain was included in the dominions of, successively, the Orthodox, Umayyad and Abbaaid Caliphates. In the esrly yeara of the 10th century A.D. the heretical sectariea known as the Qarsmita or Carmathiana aeized Bahrain and held it for a time; it subsequently underwent many vicisaitudea when a succession of Arab tribea held sway in turn. After the Mongols had captured Baghdad and overthrown the Abbasid Caliphate in 1258 A. D., they extended their control over the Persian Gulf and appointed rulers of their own over Bahrain. Towards the close of the XlVth century A.D. the forces of Timur-i- Lang (Tamerlane) overran the ialands and added them to hia vast dominions. ^rhen his heterogeneous empire broke up, Bshrsin became for some 50 or 60 years part of the realm of the semi-independent kings of Kormux, who did lip-service but no more to the rulers of Persis. Thus, once again, there wss a connection between Persia and the Bahrain ialanda, but this time it waa a very tenuous one. This shadowy Persian authority waa terminated by the Portuguese during the first quarter of the XVlth century. The Portuguese hold over the Bahrain ialanda lasted until 1602, when Shah Abbas I succeeded in establiahing his authority over them. Bahrain remained for rather more than a century part of the Safavi empire. Early in 1718 the Arabs of Muscat took advantage of the /growin g(ur, growing weakness of the Safavi state to descend upon Bahrain, but Persian control was temporarily re-established in the following year. The Arabs, however, equipped a further expedition and once more ousted the Persians. In 1720, the Safavi authorities, using shipping lent by the Portuguese, regained the islands, but the Afghan overthrow of the Safavi dynasty in 1722 led to chaos in the Persian Gulf* Taking advantage of the absence of any central authority, the Huwala Arabs, under the leadership of Shaikh Jabbara of Tahiri, established themselves in the islands; these Arabs, though nominally Persian subjects, were at that time in reality independent. In 1736 Nadir shah, who had set himself the task of making the Gulf a Persian lake, sent an expedition against the Huwalas of Bahrain, using shipping which was provided, in part at any rate, by the Sast India Company. This expedition met with complete success, and Bahrain was added to the province of Pars, as I had been done in Sasanian times. Persian control over the islands was maintained effectively through the reign of Nadir Shah (1736-17U7) and also during the ascendency of Karim Khan^(r756-1779). In 1783&gt; four years after the death of Karim Khan, the Utubi Arabs, from the Arabian mainland, wrested the Bahrain islands from the Persians. Sxcept for an interlude of 9 years, that is, from 1801 to 1810, when the islands were held first by the Muscat Arabs and then by the Wahhabis, the Al Khalifa family of the Utubie» has maintained its hold over Bahrain. Great Britain^ special connection with Bahrain began in 1820, when Shaikh Sulaiman ibn Ahmad Al Khalifa, as one of the signatories of the general treaty for the pacification of the Persian Gulf, entered into treaty relations with her. Shaikh Sulaiman's grandson Muhamnad concluded a further treaty with the Bast India Company in 131+7 for the suppression of slavery. In 1861 the conclusion of the Perpetual Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Great Britain and Bahrain resulted in the latter becoming an independent Arab State under British protection. To sum up, it will be seen that Persia has, during the last seventeen centuries, had Bahrain intermittently in her possession for some 570 years. It is to be noted, however, that over 350 of these years belong to the pre-Muhammadan era, and that there is, apparently, no concrete evidence available to show that Persian authority was absolute throughout the period of Sasanian occupation. In more recent times, Persia cannot be said to have exercised effective rule for more than 167 years in the aggregate, and it is now over 160 years since she last held the islands.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. 14th December, 1945 \ Hi (E 5226/115/91) ■ ^ Dear Donaldson, Cleary*s letter Ext.l£25 /43 of 14th July has inspired us to examine the whole question how# if the Itersians wished to press their clalu to Bahrein, the provisions of the Charter of the United Mationa wouW affect the position- :£ : iXlsa&amp;ttasrat oiil UvzaoO 1 *-• 1^' ^tersia were to attempt a direct, unilateral reference of the matter to the new International Court of Justice, we should not in this particular case be bound to accept the jurisdiction of the court. Thia, 1 cwever, applies only to a unilateral approach by Peraia, independent of tie United Nationa Organiaation| and we could always accept the Court's jurisdiction if we wished. , • e cannot, on any legal or technical grounds, prevent Persia frcci raising the matter for diacuaeion in either the General Assembly or the Security Council of the United Nations, with regard to the General Assembly, she would not have to do more than persuade it to deem the situation one 'likely to imperil the general welfare or friendly relations among nations' (Article I4 of t&gt; e Charter). There would then have to be a two- thlrds majority of the members present and voting to allow the Assembly to recomasnd measures for a peaceful adjustment or (in all likelihood, thou^i this is not specifically stated) to ask for an advisory opinion fron t .P.Donaldson, Esq., C.r.C., o /theliif- . t ^J- - v- 2. '1 -■ » the International Cart of Justice. Alternatively the Asaerably coulcl, by the 8fui« majority, bring the. matter to the notice of the Security Council as being 'likely to endanger international peace and security' (Article ii(s))* T 1 &gt; . 4 # For a direct approach to the Security Council Itersia need only claim that the maintenance of ^ international peace and security is threatened by V the continuance of tha dispute,. (Articles 34 and 5^ (1)). We cannot prevent the Council frcm investigating thir contentionnor, if it admtte it, fron proceeding to ^ reconmend terms of settlemant or refer the case to the International Court. We camot exclude the jjossibility, remote as it may seem, that Bsrsia might engineer a situation in which the Security Council would feel called upon to make some recommend a tiuni but she would have to obtain seven votes, including those of the remaining Great Powers, Any subsequent reccranendation or reference to the Court would need a similar majority, but this »ouid presumably be obtained if the earlier one had been. Neither we nor Ifersia would have any vote at this stage and we would have no ■veto' on the Council's decisions at any stage abort of enforcement action agaiaat ua. If Feraia were a xaember of the Council, she would have a vote at the enforcement stage but no 'veto'* If Persia's contention that the matter was one affecting 'peace and Security' were not admitted, it is perhaps unlikely that the Council would deal with it further and in any case it could then only make reccxmendaticns for a pacific settlement upon the request of both parties. 5 # whatever the procedure adopted, a decision or recctiinendation unfavourable to us on the part of Assembly, Council, or Court would place.ua in a disastrous dilanma. A recommendation by the Assembly /or' ®) 3. or an advisory opinion from the Court would not put us undar any legal obligation to oor.iplyj but the moral obligation, strengthened by the two- third# majority, would be overwhelming. If , on the other hand, the matter came before the Security Council as one considered likely to endanger internatl cnal peace or security, the decisions of the Council would be legally binding upon us» This would include the case of the Council •tiling upon the parties to refer the matter to the Courts and of course any ensuing decision of the Court would be binding. The fact that, having refused tc cctnply we then proceeded to veto enforcemeni action against us, would not make us any less in ^eaoh of our obligations under the Charteri and although a single breach of this kind would not entail expulsion, the probable consequences of it tire siiix iciently obvious# The political consequences for us of complying with an sdverse decision similarly need no elaboration# 6* . In considering possible courses of action the vital question for us should the matter go before the United Kations, is the political one - how the voting would go. Here the points raised in Cleary's letter come in. future develoiments aay alter the outlook, but at present it seemo to be thist- ©nv, . . . v.v a) We must expect Soviet-con trolled publicity to do all it can to embarrass us, at the same time using the situation to subvert Persia's independence, as Cleary mentions, some references to the matter have been made already, but we think nothing can be done until cctaeu out into the open. when it came to the joint, however, the Soviet Union might oppose any decisive action by the United Nations for fear of setting up a precedent to be used later against herself. /b)1! &gt; b) The attitude of the United States of America is harder to forecast, but, in spite of their oil interests in Bahrein, they would probably consider it a matter for the United Nations and expect us to submit to its arbitrament. o) A number of small states, out of schadenfreud e or even baser motives, might enjoy seeing us discomfited. The Arab states would naturally supiort us. Thus our position for a political battle in the United Nation® is not altogether satisfactory. The great disaster, a Persian victory, is e possibility, ttoufeh a remote onei and the mere discussion of the question chi a political b^sis ml/^ht involve us In difflcua ties. ?• Caroe's tentative suggestion, based cn I^tcalfe'e letter, that we should anticipate a dispute by a unilateral declaratic® warning against interference in tni3 region, is open to yet graver objections now than when it was first put forward# Besl. es , ossitly alienating United States opinion, this or any tactic savouring of obstructionism would call down on us a store of abuse and antl- imperiallst propaganda. We should be accused, too, of trying to cover up an indefensible case. 6. In the end, it is our lenal right to Banrein that we are relying on, and this the Law Officers 1 - q ~ opinion in 1934 declares to be practically unassailable., / The safest and best course seems to be, now as in 1935» to insist at the outset that the dispute is purely legal ^ and ourselves propose that it be referred immediately and directly to the International Court of Justice, ae should thereby avoid political discussion in the Assembly or Council and have the matter settled once and for all. Furthermore, we should thereby put ftersia in the position of plaintiff, the mora advantageous one of defendant accruing to ourselves, which would not be possible otherwise (for /exampleI In example. In obtaining an advisory opinion), we should naturally hava to be quite sure of cur caae, and a further review of it ^rould be needed when the dispute teamed imminent. 9* Finally I think it is worth pointing out the danger of referring loosely to Bahrein as an •independent state* • It is independent only in the Internal or iLiini- cipal sense, like one of the lialay States or Zanzibar; for international rnrroses it is simjly a British protected state and just as much within the British Empire as those other states. Since 1935 the Foreign Office has reached agreement with the India Office on this point, and we nrv.st make it clearly understood. UsXes^ we do, it will be possible to argue that His Majesty's Government has no rigtt to speak for Bahrein, which, besides causing confusion, would damage our position in i^ahrelr itself.

MEMORANDUM ON BAHREIN [The Memorandum which follows deals with the history of Bahrein from tie point of view primarily of the political status of the islands at various periods ard in particular with the claims to sovereignty over them put forward by Persia jt various dates since 1783, and with the correspondence and discussions which ha\5 taken place in connection with such claims. The principal authorities quoted, apart from original despatches and letter^ are the following;— (1) Lorimer : ' Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.' (2) Selections from 'Records of the Government of Bombay,' Vol. XXD (1856). (3) Aitchison : ' Treaties ' (1933 Edition), Vols. XI (Persian Gulf) and XII (Persia). (4) ' Precis of Correspondence regarding the Affairs of the Persian Gulf (1801 to 1853), by J. A. Saldanha (1906). (5) Sir A. T. Wilson : ' The Persian Gulf ' (1928). (6) Curzon : ' Persia.' (7) Hertslet; 'Memorandum on the separate Claims of Turkey and Persi to sovereignty over Bahrein ' (1874). (8) P.G. 13 : 'Historical Summary of Events in Territories of the Ottomai Empire, Persia and Arabia affecting the British Position in tb Persian Gulf, 1907-28.' I.—Geographical Situation 1. The Principality of Bahrein consists of the archipelago formed by tb islands of Bahrein, Muharraq, Umm Na'asan, Sitra, and Nabi Salih, and byi number of lesser islets and rocks. Taken altogether these form a compact grou almost in the middle of the V-shaped gulf on the Arabian littoral of the Persia Gulf which divides the independent Arab Trucial Sheikhdom of Qatar from tie coast of Qatif in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 2. The term '' Bahrein ' formerly embraced the promontory of Qatar and te oases of Qatif and Hasa on the Arabian mainland, as well as the islands of te archipelago, and, according to Lorimer, 'some authorities would attribute tot in the past an even more extended application, affirming that it once denoted te whole western side of the Persian Gulf from Ruus-al-Jibal to the mouth of te Shatt-el-Arab.'i II.—Bahrein prior to 1783 3. The very conflicting evidence available goes to show that Bahrein was subject to Persian rule for a period in the early part of the Christian era, and between A.D. 615 and 723. It is stated to have been conquered by one Keshin bin Abdul Malik, and to have come under the sway of the Umaiyid Caliphs, in the latter year, and to have remained under the control of the Caliphs until the close of the Abbasid dynasty in the 11th century, when it again became subject to chiefs of its own race. Its mediaeval history is obscure, but a writer who visited the islands in A.D. 1051 refers to the fact that half of the pearls taken in Bahrein belong to the Chiefs of Hasa on the Arab mainland. Idrisi, the Arab geographer, writing about a century later, states that the island ' is governed by an independent chief. The inhabitants of the two shores are satisfied with his justice and piety, and when he dies he is replaced by a person of equal virtue and piety.'' It was conquered about 1320 by the (Arab) rulers of Hormuz, a kingdom finally subdued by the Portuguese in 1506, but which appears to have been tributary to Persia in at any rate its later days. Bahrein appears at the same date to have fallen under Portuguese control. The Persians have adopted in a recent Xote on the subject a statement that it remained under Portuguese control from 1507 to 1622. It would appear, however, that there are at any rate some breaks in the continuity of Portuguese control. An agreement of 1515 between the Portu guese and the Persians, under which the King of Hormuz was to be ' ruler of Hormuz in the name of King Dom Manuel, his Lord,' provided inter alia that Portuguese shipping should be available to enable the Persians to invade Bahrein and Qatif. In 1522 a revolt stimulated by the King of Hormuz broke out against the Portuguese at Bahrein among other places, but was quelled, and in 152S endeavours by the Portuguese to quell a subsequent rebellion in Bahrein against the King were beaten off. In 1559 it was temporarily occupied by the Turks, who were, however, driven out by the Portuguese in the same year. In 1602 the Portuguese were forcibly expelled from the islands by the Persians. The Persian occupation was of uncertain duration, and in their Note of 2nd August, 1928, they refer to 1622 as the date on which Persia regained possession of Bahrein. Thet appear in any event to have had a military depot in Bahrein in 1622. Curzon states that ' the Portuguese ... in 1625 concluded a treaty with Shah Abbas, by which they restored to him all his coast possessions, retaining onlv the pearl banks at Bahrein. ...' 4. In the early years of the 18th century the authority of the Persian Government in the Gulf area was at an extremely low ebb, and it seems most unlikely that they were able to maintain a garrison in Bahrein. In 1717 the islands were occupied by the Arabs of Muscat, who appear to have met with no opposition. In 1718 however, the Persians, by means of shipping lent by the 1 ortuguese, were able to transport a force to Bahrein and temporarily to reoccupy the islands. During the confused period following upon the Afghan invasion of Persia in 1722, the Huwala Arabs established themselves on the islands : thev maintained their control until 1736 when Nadir Shah (who had built up a naval force in the Gulf) sent an expedition to Bahrein and drove out the Pluwalas. After Nadirs assassination in 1747 another period of chaos occurred, during which the Huwalas or other Arabs, gained control over the islands. However, in 1753 the iviilci undei tho 1 eisian Ciovernment oi the town of Bushire made a descent upon Bahrein, the chief resident tribe in which (the Huwala Arabs—at the present day still strongly represented in the islands) was seriously divided by internal feuds and established his authority there. In this manner the islands again became at least in name, dependent on Persia. In 1782 the Arabs of Zubarah, on the Aiabian mainland, effoits to reduce which had been made by the Governor of Bahrein under the Persians in the years immediately precedino- that date Tetaliated by a descent on the island of Bahrein. They defeated^the Persian Governor, drove him to his fort, plundered and destroyed the town of Manama and took possession of a Bushire vessel, with which thev retired to Zubarah A counter-attack was repulsed, and in the following year the Uttabi Arabs of ZubaraJh, assisted by contingents from various tribes of Qatar, occupied the Hah rem islands, the Persian garrison of the Manama Fort capitulating on 28th July, 1783, after a siege of about two months' duration, and beino- allowed to return to Bushire. Summary 5. It will be seen tihat while the history of Bahrein prior to 1783 is verv ohscnre, it would appear that Persia for not inconsiderable periods exercised control over the islands. The nature of that control is not, however verv clear- 85-177 ' ' Bombay Selections, XXIV, 23, G. of I. Desp. No. 18 of 22.2.1870, para. 2. Wilson, Persian Gulf, pp. 85-6. Wilson, 88-90. Wilson, 105.

B 2it seems probable that it was only very rarely of a definite character; and even in more recent periods Persian relations with the islands were for a substantial number of years interrupted by Portuguese occupation of or overlordship over them. It is, however, clear that Persia or a Persian vassal was in effective control of the islands during the 30 years prior to the expulsion of the Persians by the Arabs of the mainland in 1783. III.— 1783 1820. From the Expulsion of the Persians to the conclusion of the Treaty of 1820 with His Majesty's Government Bahrein 'pays Tribute to Persia, 1799 6. Projects by the Persian Government for the re-establishment of its authority in Bahrein between 1783 and 1800 did not materialise. In 1799 the Imam of Muscat declared war on the Uttabis of Bahrein, who, alarmed by his proceedings, opened a correspondence with the Persian Governor of Bushire, in the course of which they stated that the island originally belonged to the Turkish Government but that it was many—about 70—years since the Turks had been in possession of it^ 1 ) He, on their offering to become tributary to Persia, proceeded privately to Bahrein and received from them an instalment of revenue on account of the preceding year. Muscat occupies and loses Bahrein, 1800-01 7. In 1800 Bahrein was occupied by the Imam of Muscat, the occupation lasting until 1801, when the Muscat forces were invested by the Tttabis and compelled to surrender and evacuate Bahrein. In 1802 the Imam of Muscat, having obtained some assistance from Bushire, again landed in Bahrein and attacked the Uttabis. The latter had, however, by now secured the support of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia and the Muscat project was abandoned. Bahrein under Wahabi influence, 1803-11 8. From 1803 to 1809 the Uttabis of Bahrein appear to have been under the influence of the Wahabis (the Bombay Government declined to take action on an enquiry made by them in 1805 as to whether, if they withdrew from the Arabian mainland and withheld their assistance from the Wahabis, the British Govern ment would give them a ship or two to enable them to remain undisturbed at Bahrein) and they were under strict control by the Wahabi Government during 1810-11. Dispute with Muscat, 1816 Persian Envoy to Bahrein, 1816-17 9. In 1811 the islands were freed from Wahabi rule by the Imam of Muscat, when the Uttabis were restored to power, though according to a claim subsequently made by the Imam, in subordination to Muscat. In 1816 the Uttabis sought the protection of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia, and the Imam of Muscat undertook an armed expedition against Bahrein, explaining to the British authorities that he was compelled so to act by the repudiation by the Uttabis of his suzerainty, which they had admitted in 1811, by their alliance with the Wahabis and by their piratical practices. The Muscat expedition, to which three Bushire vessels were added by the Persian Government, effected a landing in the summer of 1816, but was signally repulsed and withdrew. Unsuccessful negotiations took place later in the same year between Muscat and the Persian Government with a view to a fresh attempt on Bahrein. Subsequently, but apparently in the same year, a Persian emissary, one Sikander Khan, arrived in Bahrein, who accepted presents from the Sheikhs of Bahrein for the Prince of Shiraz and conferred on them in return Persian Robes of Honour. 10. In April 1817 His Majesty's Minister in Persia reported the arrival at Tehran of an agent from the Imam of Muscat, the object of whose mission was credibly stated to be to inform the Shah that His Majesty's Government contemplated the capture of Bahrein, and to ask for armed assistance for the Imam in order that he might thwart their design by taking possession of the ( l ) This was, of course, incorrect. Turkey does not appear to have held the island since 1559 and then only for a few months.island in the name of the Persian Government. His Majesty's representative stated that an agent of the Sheikh of Bahrein was also at Tehran, bearing a letter which stated that as the inhabitants of the island were of the same sect as the natives of Persia, they had always looked up to the Persian monarch as their protector and head, and that they therefore hoped for the assistance of His Majesty to cloak them from the oppressions of the Wahabis. Approval for the Teh. Desp. grant of the military assistance desired was stated to have been given by the Shah a5.i8]7 0t to the Imam, but no action appears to have followed. 11. In 1818, on the appearance of the Egyptians in Hasa, the Sheikh of Bahrein appears to have offered to assist them with sea transport. In February Lor i, 846 1819 the Sheikh entered into an agreement with the British Government, with the terms of which he subsequently failed to comply, for preventing the sale of captured British property in his dominions, and in the same year he expressed great indignation at the violation by the British authorities, under a misappre hension as to the nationality of certain vessels, of the neutrality of his port. 12. On 19th April, 1819, His Majesty's Representative at Tehran T eh De8 P- reported to the Government of India that the Imam of Muscat had complained bitterly against the non-fulfiiment of the engagements contracted with him bv the Persian Government for the capture of Bahrein. The Minister added that letters received by him showed that the troops of Ibrahim Pasha, the Viceroy of Egypt, had occupied Bahrein (this appears to have been incorrect) and that the Imam had suggested to the Shah that he should send a messenger to the Pasha asking him to evacuate the island. The Imam is stated to have urged upon the Shah the necessity of endeavouring to recover a possession which according to him had for ages acknowledged the sovereignty of Persia. He was, however, unsuccessful, and in June 1819 His Majesty's Minister reported that the Shah had for the present dropped all intention of taking any steps in pursuit of his pretensions to the sovereignty of the island. It may be added here that the (xovernment of Bombay in a despatch of 21st July, 1819, to the Government of India, in which they discussed the desirabilitv of assisting the Imam of Muscat, in return for assistance in connection with the expedition proposed against the Gulf pirates, to establish his claims to Bahrein, referred to an 'arrangement some time since concerted between the Shah and the Imam, whereby the former bad agreed to relinquish all claims to the island of Bahrein in favour of the Imam, under the condition of receiving a portion of its revenues.' B ahrein submits to M uscat , 1820 13. The Persians, at the beginning of 1820, moved apparently by a desire to anticipate any attempt by Muscat to establish control over Bahrein with the support of His Majesty's Government, unsuccessfully requested the Imam to convey their troops to Bahrein. They addressed a similar application, equally unsuccessful, to the Commander of the British Expedition in the Persian Gulf. In the early part of 1820 the rulers of Bahrein made full submission to the Imam of Muscat and agreed to pay him a tribute of 30,000 dollars. An instalment (12,000 dollars) of this tribute appears subsequently to have been actually remitted. Lor. I, 847. P olicy of B ritish G overnment , 1819-20 14. The policy to be adopted by the British Government in regard to Bahrein was examined between the Government of Bombay and the Government of India in 1819-20, and was ultimately defined as one of complete neutrality. Govt of The transfer of Bahrein to the Imam of Muscat had been contemplated, but Bombay to this project, so far as the British Government were concerned, was now abandoned. ^9 1 he (jovernment of Bombay suggested that the Sheikh should be informed that paras. 2, 3. so long as he restrained his subjects from piracy he would reap the advantage oi a friendly neutrality on the part of Britain, whereas should a piratical spirit manifest itself forcible measures of coercion would be applied to him. They added that the conclusion of an engagement in general terms with the Sheikh would probably tend to convince the Uttabi Arabs of the inte^ritv of our intentions.' J British Offer to Persia of Mediation with Bahrein, 1820 15. Simultaneously the Government of Bombay, in a despatch to the Charge Dated d'Affaires at Tehran, remarked that 'we mean to avoid all interference in respect of the island of Bahrein .... There is, however, reason to believe that ' ''provided the Persian Government will consent to the TJttabis continuing in the undisturbed occupation of Bahrein the Sheikh would readily agree to pay tribute, and for this purpose the mediation of the British Government woul' be gladly afforded provided it could be employed in such a manner as to avoid anvthing which might in any shape involve us in the transactions of the partis after the conclusion of the negotiation immediately referred to . . .

On 17th January, 1820, the Sheikh agreed to surrender certain pirate craft which had taken refuge in his territories, and undertook to the Brh'iMi Government not to admit any more boats of the same character until authoi ise( to do so bv the British authorities. On 5th February, 1820, a preliminary Treaty of Peace was signed between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government and on 23rd February, 1820, the Sheikhs were admitted to the benefits of the General Treaty of Peace which had been made between His Majesty's Govern ment and the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf and under which His Majesty's Government undertook, in return for abstention by those rulers from pn a; \ and the slave trade, that ' if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it' (Article 10). The Sheikh of Bahrein went so far as to claim subsequently that the treaty in question established relations of protec tion and dependence between the British Government and himself, but it was made clear to him by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf while on a visit to Bahrein in 18'23 that this was not the case.

On 10th May, 1820, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran reported to the Government of Bombay that he had been received in audience by the Shah on 5th May and had put to him the proposal referred to in paragraph 15 ! or British mediation with a view to securing tribute to Persia from Bahrein The Shah had replied that 'he wished that advices should be received from Shiraz before the mediation of the British Government to render Bahrein a tributary to Persia can be accepted.' Sir H. Willock remarked that ' the great repugnance of the Shah to the formation of any British settlement in the neighbourhood of Persia was strongly manifested by His ^Tajesty s not immediately accepting tlu British mediation' to obtain a tribute from the island of Bahrein, an object which he so urgently desired and which His Majesty was aware must at a future period be difficult of attainment from the already advanced stage of negotiations between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and the Imam of Muscat.' and ivithdrawn (1820) No 1485 to 18. On the 3rd October, 1820, the Government of Bombay instructed Sir H. Tehran. Willock to take the earliest opportunity of informing the Persian Government ' that as our views are exclusively limited to the extirpation of piracy, it would £ be contrary to our policy, in the present state of the Gulf, to afford the mediation we formerly offered between His Majesty [the Shah] and the Uttabis of Bahrein.' Summary, 1783-1820 19. In 1799 the Sheikhdom, independent since 1783, professed allegiance to Persia and paid a year's tribute, but it was immediately afterwards con quered by the Imam of Muscat, and thereafter fell under the influence and ultimately the control of the Wahabi Amir. Liberated by Muscat in 1811, it aopealed to the Wahabis in 1816 against the Imam and defeated him. 1 ' In 1816 or 1817 a Persian envoy was received at Bahrein and presents exchanged While no details are available as to what precisely took place on this occasion the incident had no effective sequel. Persian authority was not asserted in the island between the date of the visit and 1820, and in the latter year the island became temporarily subject and tributary to Muscat. In 1820 Bahrein entered into its first formal treaty with the British Govern ment. and that Government, on condition that the Sheikhs abstained from piracy, undertook to ' take notice ' ' if any shall attack them.'^ f i IY.—1820 30 Unauthorised Agreement between Captain Bruce and the Prince Governor of S hiraz, 1822 flrHnl 0 ™ VV 822 Ca 5 )ta ' n BrU J Ce ' tl l e Political Resident in the Persian Gulf , \ Ks ^ WI1 initiative and without any authority from or prior reference to Government, having proceeded of his own accord to Shiraz there signed an pf^nhT 1 ^ 6 f niS i^ r 0 ! the Prince Governor of Shiraz, on the part of h IV a\' K alleged, inter alia, m regard to Bahrein, that the islands the rfS S t0 , the GoVernor 0 ' Fars . whose authontv ntfoVf ] D i lkhs had , become rebellious; that the flag assigned to the a nt, of Bahrein under the General Treaty of Peace with Britain in 1820 hi' flitiir'T' i'' V ' .granted, be withdrawn, that no assistance should trarv the Rr^fV by ^ Uttabis of Bahrein , and that on the con - trary the Brit sh Government should , if requested , assist the Persians against Bahrein w.th ' one or two vessels of war.

'' He was informed that no control was assumed over the people of Bahrein and that the letter disapproving of Captain Bruce's treaty had manifested the line of conduct Government would pursue in regard to Bahrein. The expedition was abandoned on a pretext, ' but the Sheikh averted the danger which threatened him by presents of considerable amount.' 25. In October 1828 a last attack by the Imam of Muscat was severely defeated and driven off, ' after several undignified attempts to conclude a peace with the ' Sheikhs of Bahrein, and on 2nd December, 1829, peace was finally made between the Sheikhs and the Imam. The main provisions of this agreement were that tribute should not in future be paid by Bahrein to Muscat, and that neither ruler should henceforth interfere in the affairs of the other. By a supplementary verbal agreement the parties bound themselves to aid one another in the event of an attack by a third party. Summary, 1820-30 26. During the first two years of this period the islands acknowledged the supremacy of and, for a time, paid tribute to Muscat. From 1822 to 1829 they were intermittently at feud with Muscat. In 1829 a treaty was concluded by which Muscat withdrew its claims to supremacy and to tribute. The Persian claim was alluded to in 1822 and 1825 but not pressed. Lor. I, 856-7. Lor.

In the course of 1830-31 the Sheikhs, His Majesty's Government having refused to intervene in their favour, and fearing a combination between the Amir and Muscat, formally submitted to the Wahabi Amir of the Arab mainland. They agreed to acknowledge the Amir's supremacy and to pay a tribute to him. He on his part undertook to protect Bahrein against external aggression. In 1833, however, the Sheikh felt strong enough to repudiate Wahabi supremacy, and he conducted a not unsuccessful offensive against the Wahabis between 1833 and 1835. Bahrein and the British Government 28. Sheikh Khalifah-bin-Salman, who had been joint ruler with his uncle sheikh Abdullah since the death of Sheikh Salman in 1825, died in 1834, and was vsucceeded as joint ruler by his son Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah. Effective control continued to rest with Sheikh Abdullah. Internal dissension in the ruling [amily became more marked between 1834 and 1839, and the misgovern- ment of the island continued to grow with unfortunate effects on its prosperity. His Majesty's Government, although in 1834 they had to take forcible measures against the Sheikh to secure reparation for an insulf to their Residency Agent in Bahrein, were, however, content to abstain from any interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein so long as the Sheikhs discharged the obligations undertaken by their Treaty of 1820. Restrictive Line applied to Bahrein, 1836 29. In 1835 the British Government renewed the maritime truce which they had imposed in 1820 on the Arab rulers of the Gulf in the interest of the suppres sion of piracy. The Sheikh of Bahrein was not, however, included in the renewed truce, partly apparently because he had behaved so well that this was thought unnecessary, partly because he could be easily punished in the event of this proving desirable, and partly lest in the event of his inclusion he might claim British intervention if attacked by Muscat. In March 1836 the Sheikh agieedj howevei, to the application to Bahrein of the ' Restrictive Line, ' this being a line laid down in that year by His Majesty's Government between which and the Persian coast no naval hostilities were in future to be perhiitted. Reassertion of Persian claim. Bahrein tributary to the Wahahis, 1836 30. In the middle of 1836 the Sheikh, alarmed by a communication from e Lrovemoi of Shiraz calling on him as a Persian subject to tender his sub mission to the Shah, and by the possibility of the co-operation of the Imam of a . s i an a ^ ac ^ on Bahrein, took steps for a reconciliation with the Wahabi Amir. As a result, he agreed to pav a nominal tribute of |2 000 to the Amir, the Amir on his side agreeing to supply troops for the defence of ^r\ N9 Bahrein against external attacks and to refrain from calling on the Sheikh for marine transport in the event of a Wahabi attack on Muscat by sea. 31. In 1837 the Sheikh, with the prior approval of Her Majesty s Crovern- ment was allowed to punish certain pirates. In 1839 the Resident was invoker to settle internal disputes in the ruling family, but the parties would not agree to any settlement without a guarantee by Her Majesty s Government, which Hei Majesty's Government were not prepared to give. Egyptian Invasion of Hasa : Sheikh professes to be a Persian Subiect, 1839 32. In 1838-39 the Egyptians conquered Hasa and captured the Wahabi | e 0 «^ ng&gt; Amir. Thev thereupon demanded the payment of tribute and certain territorial xxiv, 387-8. concessions from the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Egyptian Commandei about the same time intimated to the British authorities his intention to attack and reduce the island. The Sheikh appealed for assistance to the Government of India, but in the absence of instructions from Her Majesty's Government the Govern- ^ ment of India were at first not prepared to give him any pledge and the Sheikh was instructed to decide for himself as to waiting on the Egyptian representa tive. Much alarmed by the proceedings of the Egyptians, ' and perhaps even more so by a rumour, apparently well founded, that the Saiyed of Oman was intriguing with the Egyptians to obtain and hold Bahrein as a fief under the Viceroy of Egypt,' the Sheikh thereon professed, in reply to demands made on him in the name of the Egyptians, to be a subject of the Persian Government. Apparently as the result of overtures by the Sheikh designed to substantiate this, the Prince Governor of Shiraz thereupon sent an envoy—one Haji Qasim, Tior. I, 862. formerly supercargo of a trading vessel—to reside in Bahrein as Persian agent, 'and to be the medium of receiving and transmitting the annual tribute which the Persian authorities vainly flattered themselves the Bahrein Chief was disposed to pay for their countenance and protection,' and to bear a Robe of Honour and a letter to the Sheikh. The envoy was accompanied by a guard of ten Persian 1°™*^ infantry. No details appear to be available about his mission, which was xxiv, 388. apparently a failure. 33. On 1st April, 1839. Admiral Sir E. Maitland, then commanding the Gulf Squadron, was instructed by the Government of Bombay to give the Sheikh Bombay to all support against the Egyptians, short of actually entering on hostilities. If ^ t s e ' d the Sheikh asked for a new engagement with Her Majesty's Government he ' should offer to transmit his proposals to India. The Resident was simultaneously to send a formal protest to the Egyptians. On the 18th April the Government of India empowered the Admiral, if the Sheikh claimed British intervention and offered to place his territories under British protection, 'to assure him of the temporary protection of Her Majesty's squadron in the Gulf,' to inform the Egyptians that this pledge had been given and to urge them to abstain from further military proceedings until the views of both Governments were known, failing which Bahrein would be defended against intervention by them until the pleasure of Her Majesty's Government had been communicated to the local Lor. I, 864. authorities. In the same month the Sheikh promised the Assistant Political Resident to take no steps to place himself under the authority or protection of a foreign Power without first consulting the Political Resident. Sheikh submits to Egyptians (July 1839) 34. In July 1839 the Sheikh ' suddenly and unexpectedly ' acknowledged the supremacy of the Egyptians and agreed to pay them a tribute of 2,000 dollars a year, on the understanding that his local authority would be observed and that no representative of the Egyptians would be sent to reside in Bahrein. The L or i Resident protested in writing to both the Sheikh and the Egyptians, and ^mbay expostulated with the Sheikh on the way in which he was sacrificing his ^xiv.'^m independence. The Sheikh explained that his action was the result of the refusal of Her Majesty's Government to give him advice or a specific assurance of support. For a trifling financial payment he had now secured immunity from interference. He offered, however, in return for a written and distinct pledge poi. Res. to of protection, to repudiate his agreement with the Pasha and to avow himself S ovt b of a dependent of Her Majesty's Government; but on being pressed he refused - ijtb S ' to confirm this in writing and said that in any event it would be necessary for him to justify his change of attitude to the Egyptians on the ground that it was the result of compulsion by Her Majesty's Government. 85—177 c :\ \10 Precis, 393. Hertslet, 1874, p. 5. 1839-40. Views of Her Majesty's Government on future Policy towards Bahrein 35. As a consequence of the activities of the Egyptians discussion appears about this time to have taken place as to the desirability of declaring a regular protectorate over Bahrein. On 1st July, 1839, the Secret Committee of the East India Company informed the Government of India that if necessary they would ''not disapprove of your entering into an engagement with the Chief of Bahrein to protect him against encroachments from Mehemet Ali, but we concur in the doubt expressed by Captain Hennell | then Political Resident ] as to whether it would be expedient for that island to be taken under the protection of the British Government.' On 24th February, 1840, the Foreign Office wrote to the India Board (with reference to an enquiry from the Bombay Government) that it was important that the Egyptian troops should not be allowed to take posses sion of Bahrein and that if the Company's troops could occupy it, even provi sionally, such a measure could not fail to be attended with advantage. On the retirement of the Egyptians from Hasa in 1840 their relations with the Sheikh came to an end. Summary, 1830 40 36. From 1831-33 Bahrein was subject and tributary to the Wahabi Amirs. She revolted from them in the latter year, but in 1836 again entered into an understanding, which appears to have lasted until 1838. under which Bahrein paid a tribute and received guarantees of assistance against external attack. In 1838 the Wahabi Amir was himself conquered by the Egyptians. The Persians reasserted their claim in 1836, the Bahreini answer being a renewal of their understanding with the Wahabi Amirs. In 1839, when faced by a demand for tribute from Egypt, Bahrein appealed to Persia, claimed to be a Persian subject, and received a Persian envoy. But immediately after she formally acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and paid tribute to Egypt. The visit of the Persian envoy had thus no effective sequel. No. 591, 27.3.1840. Precis, 394. India Board letter, 22.10.1840. Lor. I, 866. Lor. I, 873. yl—1840 50 37. In 1840 the Government of India, provoked by the attitude which the Sheikh had adopted, decided not to restiain the Imam of Muscat in the event of his wishing to conquer Bahrein. On 27th March, 1840, the Secret Committee remarked to the Government of India ' We consider ourselves .... relieved from all regard to the interests of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and we should be glad to hear that his island was in possession of a friendly chieftain.' 38. Towards the end of 1840 the Imam of Muscat informed the Resident that while his views in regard to Bahrein remained unaltered, he had been restrained from giving effect to them by his impression that Her Majesty's Government were averse to the prosecution of his claim and that without their assistance or that of the Egyptians he would have no chance of success. Expulsion of Sheikh Abdullah. Succession of Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifa (1843-68) 39. Internal dissensions in the Sheikhdom between the ruler. Sheikh Abdullah, and his grand-nephew and co-ruler. Sheikh Mohamed, became increasingly bitter, and Sheikh Mohamed was finally expelled from the island. In November 1842 he was given permission by Her Majesty's Government to attack Sheikh Abdullah. After a civil war which lasted from January to April 1843, Abdullah was expelled by Mohamed, who thereafter held the Sheikh dom, no reply being sent to an appeal to restrain the attackers which was made by Abdullah to the British authorities in February 1843. Intrigues of ex-Sheikh , 1843-49 40. Between 1843 and 1849 the ex-Sheikh appealed at various times for the assistance of the Wahabis, the Trucial Sheikhs, the Sheikh of Koweit, and the British and Persian authorities to enable him to recover his position. In 1843 Her Majesty's Government dissuaded Muscat from trying to conquer Bahrein —considerations which weighed with them being inter alia the risk of provoking the Wahabis and the danger of giving Persia an excuse to espouse the cause of the ex-Sheikh. In the same year the ex-Sheikh twice visited Bushire, where he failed to find any consolation from the Resident, who, on his stating that $ &gt;,11 if disappointed by Her Majesty's Government he was ready to throw himself into the arms of Persia, informed him (October 1843) that the adherence of Persia to his cause would not be recognised by Britain unless it was open and d'ocl cti*0cl 41. In the course of his visits the ex-Sheikh entered into discussions with the nephew of the Persian Sheikh of Bushire, who, while holding no official position himself, promised him military assistance from Persia. On representa tions being thereupon made to the Persian Prime Minister by Her Majesty s Minister at Tehran, the Prime Minister 'informed me that Sheikh Suleiman had acted with great presumption in having interfered in political affairs with out having any authority from the Government, and he said that he would reprimand him for his conduct. His Excellency added that Bahrein belonged jQ h Q^ es |g43 to Persia and that she would take possession of it when more pressing affairs ' ' were disposed of. As I looked on this as mere idle boasting which was never likely to be fulfilled, I thought it unnecessary to pursue the conversation.' 42. It may be recorded that on a second visit of the ex-Sheikh to Bushire Lor. I, 875. from December' 1843 to March 1844, he is stated to have been received with distinction by the Persians, and to have offered, if reinstated, to pay the cost, to remit in future a large annual tribute to the Shah, and to leave one son as a hostage in Persia. His proposals were not, however, accepted by the Persian Government. 43. In 1844 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed by the Government of India to resist by force any attempt by Persia to establish troops on the island of Bahrein. During the same year the ex-Sheikh, having, x® 23° while residing at Naband in South Persia, captured two Bahreini vessels, the 21.8 .1844. ruling Sheikh appealed to the Resident, with the result that jin injunction was Hertsiet, 6. issued by the Central Persian Government at the instance of'the British envoy Lor - I ' 876_ ' directing the Governor-General of Fars to compel Sheikh Abdullah to give up the boats he had taken and abstain from disturbing the peace of the Gulf. Views of Her Majesty's Government on Persian Claim and on future Policy , 1844-45 44. Consequent on indications that Persia intended to intervene in the succession at Bahrein on behalf of the ex-Sheikh Abdullah the general question of policy was considered by Her Majesty's Government in the early part of 1844 in the light of an intimation by the Government of India that they would see the strongest objections to any such interference by Persia, which could not but react adversely on British interests. As a result. Her Majesty's Minister was informed (Foreign Office Despatch to Tehran, No. 23, dated 1st May, 1844), that ' the question of the right of Persia to interfere and of the Indian Government to prevent interference necessarily depends upon the validity of the pretension put forward by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Her Majesty's Govern ment are ignorant of the grounds of such pretension, and, assuming those grounds to be insufficient, they would claim for the British Government the right to prevent, if it accorded with its policy to do so, any direct interposition of Persia in the quarrels of rival claimants to the possession of Bahrein. The British Government in India at present consider that any such disturbance as may be occasioned by military operations on the part of Persia directed against the island of Bahrein would be injurious to British interests, and, therefore, unless Persia can show that she has a clear and indisputable right to the sovereignty of Bahrein; that she has exercised it without interruption under the dynasty of the Kajar family; that consequently her present policy is directed to the main tenance of her lawful claims and not to the assertion of a pretension not founded on law, she must be prepared to encounter in any scheme of this kind the active opposition of the British Government in India.' In these circumstances the Minister was instructed to inform the Persian Government that ' Her Majesty's Government had heard with regret that that Government contemplated takmg part in the disputes respecting the Government of Bahrein; that such a proceeding would be viewed with much jealousy by the British Government in India; and that unless the right of Persia to interfere in the matter is beyond dispute, any interference on her part might lead to unpleasant discussions with England. For, although Her Majesty's Government do not dispute the right of Persia as an independent Power to adopt any line of policy not inconsistent with its engagements to foreign States which she might think advantageous to herself, they claim for themselves a corresponding right to judge and act in such matters as they may think fit.' 85—177 c 212 Discussions with Persia, 1844-45 No* 69°of ^ a commim i ca tio n i n these terms being made to the Persian Prime 22 0 6.i844 ) Minister, the Prime Minister ' said he would undertake to prove the right of Persia to possession of that island, and that in the meantime he would not make - any movement against it without giving previous notification of such an intention to the British Government.' Teh. to f.o ., 46. In February 1845 the Minister at Tehran sent home a letter received 2521845^ from the Prime Minister, from which it appeared that the Persian claim was essentially based on the Convention of 1822 between Captain Bruce and the Minister of the Prince Governor of Fars. (See paragraphs 20-21 above.) Teh. to f.o ., 47. In a subsequent despatch the Minister said that he had informed the isaia^ Prime Minister that the Bruce Agreement was unauthorised and had been repudiated at the time, and that the Prime Minister had thereupon sent him a fuller statement of the grounds of the Persian claim. The result of enquiries which His Majesty's Minister had made consequent on the receipt of this state ment 'confirmed me in the opinion that this island has not formed part ot the dominions of Persia since the accession of the Kajar dynasty | 1795]. It is true that the Chiefs of Bahrein have in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to this country | Persia] as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat continue to do, without an acknowledgment of subjection,( 2 ) and it is also not unlikely that the rulers of that island may have declared themselves to be subjects of the Shah when threatened with sub jugation from Bagdad, but I cannot ascertain that Persia has exercised any real control over it within the last fifty or sixty years.' The Minister added that in further suppoil of their claim the Persian Government had sent him a gold coin struck at BBirein in 1817 in the name of Fateh Ali Shah Kajar, which he believed to be genuine. Secret 48. The fuller statement of claim put forward by the Persian Government B^of 1 Control was investigated by the Secret Committee of the East India Company, who, 31.7.1845. ' after detailed examination of it, reached the conclusion 'that Persia has no legitimate claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein.' It may be remarked that the Persian claim was largely based on a general claim that the Persian Gulf from the Shatt-el-Arab to Muscat and all the islands in it belonged to Persia; that the employment in English of the term ' Persian Gulf ' was itself evidence of this; that from about 1300 a.d . the island of Bahrein had always been in the possession of the Governors of Fars and had paid revenue to them until its conquest in 1783 by the Uttabi Arabs, from which tribe ' itself, likewise, presents have generally been sent to the Governors of Fars '; that Her Majesty's Govern ment had recognised the position when they warned Mehemet Ali of Egypt in 1840 not to attack Bahrein, which did not form part of Arabia, but rather of the Persian Gulf; ' and that accordingly the British Government would not allow him to extend the hand of possession over that island''; that the British authorities had formally and repeatedly asked Persia to rent the island to them and that British representatives at Tehran had frequently declared that Her Majesty's Government had no right whatever to the Gulf or its islands [there is no foundation for either statement |; and that the fact that Captain Bruce's treaty was on record supported the Persian claim. The following extract, which (except as regards the initial date) appears correctly to represent the true facts, may, however, be placed on record from the Prime Minister's memorandum : ' In the commencement of the reign of His Majesty the late Shah, the Arabs of Beni Attabi came from the desert and conquered the island by sea. The object and desire of the Persian Government has since always been and is the recovery of that island from its spoilers.' 49. Her Majesty's Government, in view of the unlikelihood that Persia had. or could give effect to, any serious designs in Bahrein and the undesirability of engaging in those circumstances in a correspondence which might merely cause irritation without serving any useful purpose, instructed the Minister at Tehran not to revert to the subject unless it was forced upon him by the Persian Prime Minister. In that case he was to employ certain arguments supplied to him (apparently the critical comments of the Secret Committee of the East India Company on the Prime Minister's memorandum) to show generally the grounds f.o . to Teh. on which Her Majesty's Government were 'unable to recognise as valid the No.' 38 of claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and you may add 7.8.1845. m-'- ( a ) On this point the Secret Committee of the East India Company remarked: 'Presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia.' (Secret Committee to India Board, Slst July, 1845.)13 V' Lor. T, 880. that they would .... very much disapprove of any attempts on the part of Persia to interfere in the affairs of that island and thus disturb the peace of the Gulf and to afford an opening to piracy.' The question appears to have dropped for the time being. Treaty of Peace with Wahahis, to whom Bahrein pays Tribute (1847) 50. Meanwhile, the ex-Sheikh (who in 1845 had unsuccessfully attempted Lor. I, 877. to capture Bahrein with the aid of the Wahabis) had been invited in June 1846 by the Governor-General of Fars to return to Bushire, where he should Lor. I, 877. be liberally entertained 'until .... the season for action had arrived,' but he declined the invitation. In October 1846 the Wahabi Amir asked the per mission of the Resident to call in the Trucial Sheikhs of the Arab littoral against Bahrein. This was refused. A request by the ruling Sheikh of Bahrein to be allowed to call in the assistance of the Sheikh of Debai against the Wahabis was equally refused in November 1846. In August 1847 a Treaty of Peace was concluded between the Wahabi Amir and the ruling Sheikh, under which the ruling Sheikh agreed to pay a tribute of 4,000 dollars a year, while the W T ahabi Amir agreed not to encourage the ex-Sheikh. Slavery Treaty with Great Britain, 1847 51. On 8th March, 1847, Her Majesty's Government entered into a Slavery Treaty with the ruling Sheikh. Turkish Designs on Bahrein, 1847 52. In the same year the first Turkish claim to suzeraintv over Bahrein Lor i 881 was put forward, the Turkish Mutasallim of Basra writing 'to the Sheikh ' inyiting him to declare his allegiance to the Sultan and to submit lists of his fo to India shipping for registration. These overtures were evaded by the Sheikh, while Bd,'28.9.1847. the Porte assured Her Majesty's Government that they did not intend to use compulsion against him; but that 'if the Governor of Bussorah had attempted by negotiation to induce any of the Maritime Chiefs of the Persian Gulf to return to their allegiance to the Porte, they could not disapprove his doing so.' Persian Intrigues, 1848 53 In the following year correspondence took place between the Persian Bushire to Consul-General at Bagdad, the ex-Sheikh (whom he advised to press ahead, since Tehran, Persia would surely assist him) and the ruling Sheikh, whom he addressed in of friendly terms. The correspondence was put a stop to consequent on represen tations by the British Resident at Bagdad. In 1849 the ex-Sheikh died.

J he overtures made by the T urks in 1847 gave rise between 1847 and 1849 to consideration by the Government of Bombay, the Government of India and Her Majesty's Government of the policy to be adopted in regard to Bahrein. 1 he Sheikh hinted in 1847 that unless certain grievances were met he might | j0r j 881 become a Turkish subject. His grievances were accordingly remedied by the Bo. to Res.. Government of Bombay. That Government represented, however, that it was 33 i ' desirable to exclude interference in Gulf affairs by foreign Powers, since unless 1 ' Hei Majesty s Government retained the supreme control they could not secure the permanence of the objects (the suppression of piracy, &amp;c.) on which so much mone\ had been spent. 1 he Court of Directors concurred in the Government of Bombay s recommendation that any attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted ■ ^ne British Naval Force and that the Resident should be so informed. On 11th October, 1847, the Foreign Office, in a letter to the India Board, m which they referred to recent Turkish assurances that the Turkish Govern- ment had no intention of using compulsion with regard to Bahrein, added that i ni . Government has any further apprehensions on the subject, and if the Bahrein Chief is really an independent ruler, the best course would be to make with him a treaty of alliance which would secure his independence and his friendly connection with England.' The Resident, who deemed it inexpedient t lat Het Majesty s Government should involve itself in the embarrassments likely to arise from a closer alliance with Bahrein (letter of 25th January, 1848), was, however, opposed to making the existing connection closer, as were the Secret Committee of the East India Company, who expressed the view that the of 1847.14 4 Lor.

Resident ' had exercised a wise discretion in not taking any step for the negotia tion of a new treaty with Bahrein/' The Resident was, at the same time, authorised, while avoiding discussion with the Turks, to ascertain whether the Sheikh was inclined to enter into a closer connection with Her Majesty s Government. S heikhs R equest to be taken under B ritish P rotection R efused (1849). 56. In January 1849, however, the Sheikh spontaneously asked to be taken under British protection. The Resident, who, as stated above, had originally opposed, ultimately supported this request, but after a lengthy discussion the (lovernment of India and Her Majesty s Government agreed that a change of policy was inexpedient, and the Resident was instructed in September 1^40 to decline the Sheikh's overtures, but to assure him of the continuance of the good will and friendship of Her Majesty's Government. Persian Protest, 1848 57. During the course of these discussions, the Persian Government pro tested against British interference in the affairs of Bahrein, whereupon they were informed by the Minister at Tehran in February 1848 that the British Government were unable to recognise as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Designs of Muscat, 1849 58. In June 1849 the Imam of Muscat, having intimated his desire to send an expedition to take possession of Bahrein, and having asked the opinion of Her Majesty's Government, was strongly dissuaded from doing so by Her Majesty's Government. Summary, 1840-50 59. The ruling Sheikh was expelled in 1843 and continued to intrigue to regain the throne till his death in 1849, appealing for assistance during this period to the Wahabis, Persia, Muscat and Great Britain, in all cases unsuccessfully. In 1847 'Turkey asserted a claim to Bahrein. In the same year the islands submitted themselves to the Wahabi Amir and agreed to pay tribute to him. Claims by Persia were advanced, but rejected, in 1844-45 and 1848. Muscat was dissuaded from attacking Bahrein in 1849. Her Majesty's Government, on consideration of the policy to be adopted in regard to Bahrein, decided against establishing a protectorate and refused a request put forward in 1849 by the Sheikh to be taken under British protection. They assured him at the same time of their general goodwill, and their deliberations made it clear that they regarded the island as independent, but were reluctant to assume further responsibility in relation to it so long as its independence and the performance of the engagements undertaken by the Sheikh could be secured without their doing so. yii.—1850-61 D isputes with W ahabis, 1850-51 60. In 1850 the Resident found it necessary to take disciplinary action against the ruling Sheikh—an individual of ' irresponsible character.' Conse quent on strained relations between the Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir, the Amir, with whom the sons of the ex-Sheikh Abdullah were associated, in 1850-51 threatened Bahrein, whereupon the Sheikh ' against his own better judgment. . . . tendered a small annual tribute to the Amir,' a circumstance from which it may perhaps be inferred that he had failed to observe the agreement of 1847 referred to in paragraph 50 above. The Amir rejected the offer and made exorbitant demands instead. The Sheikh was about to succumb to a combination of the sons of the ex-Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir 'when a British squadron arriving off Bahrein took the islands under their protection.' Peace was subse quently made with the Wahabis in July 1851. H er M ajesty's G overnment and the C laims of T urkey (1851) 61. In the same year Her Majesty's Government decided that the Turkish Government should be informed at Constantinople that Her Majesty's Govern ment, having heard that the Sheikh was desirous of placing himself under15 Turkish protection, could not acknowledge or acquiesce in any such arrangement, India Bd. seeing that the Government of British India had had relations with Bahrein as an independent State and had concluded with it certain treaties, namely, one in to 1820 for the suppression of piracy and one in 1847 for the prohibition of the Ssoi^' exportation of slaves, and that Her Majesty's Government must object to any India Bd arrangement which would transfer Bahrein to the dominion or protectorship of any other Power. Lor. i, 885. 62. In the correspondence leading up to this decision Lord Palmerston s cannh.g, remarked : 'I come to the conclusion that it is the opinion of the East India Constanti- Company that the object first to be aimed at is to prevent Bahrein from falling 12.2.1851°' 40 ' under the control of any foreign Power, and to keep that island in its present condition of political independence. But I infer from what has been stated in the despatches which you have communicated to me, that if that independence could no longer be maintained, and if the ruler and the people of Bahrein were determined to place themselves under some foreign protection, the East India Company would think that less evil would arise from affording to Bahrein British protection than from allowing French, Persian or Turkish authority to be established in that island.' Attitude of the Wahahis and of Muscat, 1852-53 63. In 1852 the Sheikh proposed to withhold his tribute from the Wahabi Lor Amir, but on the advice of the Resident decided to pay it. In the same year the Consul at Zanzibar was instructed to inform the Imam of Muscat that Her Majesty's Government saw no reason to alter the views regarding the possession of Bahrein communicated to His Highness in 1849 (paragraph 58 above). In May 1853 the Government of India authorised the Government of Bombay to oftei every obstacle to an attack on Bahrein by the Wahabi Amir (who was now Lor nominally subject to the Turkish Government) on the ground that Her Majesty's Government would not permit the occupation of Bahrein by the Turkish Govern ment or by anyone acting for them or in their interest. Principle of Non-Interference in Internal Affairs laid down by Bombay Government (1854) 64. On 20th November, 1854, the Government of Bombay in a letter to the Resident laid down the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein, and authorised the Resident simultaneously to inform the Sheikh of Qatif on the Arab mainland that the British Government would not tolerate his further interference with the affairs of Bahrein. Slavery Agreement with Her Majesty's Government (1856) 65. On lOth May, 1856, an agreement supplementary to the Treaty of 1847 (paragraph 51 above) regarding the slave trade was made with the Sheikh. Its contents were identical with that of corresponding engagements entered into at the same time by the Arab rulers of the Trucial Coast. 66. The Sheikh's internal government continued to go from bad to worse. In September 1858 reparation was secured from him for the ill-treatment of British subjects in Bahrein. In 1859 a Wahabi attack was averted by British intervention The local Wahabi Governor sued for pardon to the Senior Naval Officer; the Wahabi ruler, however, made a formal protest, asserted his authority over Bahrein, and declared that he was himself a vassal of the Sultan of Turkey J he Resident, in reply, informed him of the determination of Her Majesty's Government to preserve the independence of Bahrein, and pointed out the incon sistency of his piratical attacks on Turkish shipping with his professions of dependence on the Ottoman Government. Sheikh's Appeal to Persia and Turkey, 1859-61 67. At the end of 1859 or early in 1860, as the result, apparently, partly T T QQQ of apprehensions of the Wahabis and partly of irritation at the restraint ' 888 ' ™? ed 7 the Resident over his piratical activities directed against the Wanabis, the Sheikh made a simultaneous appeal for assistance to the Persian t &gt; Governor of Fars and the Turkish Wali of Bagdad. The Turkish answer was Bomb-, 0 tht-Sheikh arrived Ann M 6 TK 3 P ™/i™an to iMieiKn, arrivea m April i860.

The Persian emissary, however, refused to leave Bahrein 'or surrender his imaginarv authority in the Sheikhdom. The Resident reported in July 1860 that t$ the Ottoman flag has now become the national one.' The Sheikh appears to have endeavoured to play off each party against the other. Views of the Minister at Tehran and the Government of Bombay 68. The Minister at Tehran regarded the matter as one of relatively small importance. He pointed out to the Persian Government ' that under no circum stances can the British Government be expected to concur in the proposed transfer of the sovereignty of Bahrein to the Persian Crown, since we have contracted engagements with the Arab Sheikhs of the island as independent Chiefs, and since the maintenance of their independence is indispensable to the successful working of those plans of maritime police in the Persian Gulf which we have been at so much pains and expense to establish ; and obtained an assurance from Persia that no military occupation of Bahrein should be attempted until the title to the island had been settled .through the diplomatic channel. He advised the Resident that, while hostilities against Bahrein were to be repelled by force, a voluntary tender of allegiance by the Sheikh to any other Power might, so long as it was unaccompanied by any military occupation, be ignored as of no particular importance. In the light of the Mmistei s \iews the Government of Bombay instructed the Resident that ne should not intei teie with the occupation of Bahrein, whether by Persia or Turkey, save by protest and by an intimation that the matter had been referred to Her Majesty's Government; but at the same time that the agents of both Powers (Turkey and Persia) should be warned that aggression by or in the name of Bahrein on neigh bouring tribes would not be allowed and would, if necessary, be prevented by force. ' In representing the matter to the Secretary of State for India they urged that in the interests of the peace of the Gulf it would be better that Bahrein should be regarded as independent and as subject neither to Turkey nor to Persia, that its independence should be recognised, and the engagements into which in the interests of humanity we had entered with its rulers for the preser vation of the peace and good order of the Gulf should be maintained. . H er M ajesty's G overnment decide that B ahrein shall be regarded as I ndependent (1861) 69. In February 1861 Her Majesty's Government, after discussion between the India Office and the Foreign Office, approved- the recommendation of the Government of Bombay. The Resident and the Minister at Tehran were so informed. During part of the time at any rate that the question was under consideration in London the Turkish and Persian agents or their representatives appear (though it is not clear how consistently) to have remained in Bahrein, and the flags of both Powers to have been flown simultaneously. On 27th February, 1861, the Political Resident reported that ' the Persian and Turkish flags still fly on the forts of the island and in an interview that Commander Cruttenden had with Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah at his own request he (the Chief) remarked in respect to them that they were displayed ' merely to suit his own fancy. What did he care for Turk or Persian? He valued the friendship of the British Government highly.'' c Pol. Res. to Sheikh, 25.5.1861. British ConYention of 31st May, 1861, with the Sheikh 70. In May 1861 the Sheikh, refusing to discontinue a blockade which he had imposed on the Wahabi coast, was informed by the Resident of the decision of Her Majesty's Government that he was regarded as an independent Chief and that in these circumstances he must be held responsible by them for any piratical activities in which he might indulge. The Sheikh proved obdurate; he was threatened with forcible measures by the Resident and two of his ships were seized. He accordingly submitted, and on 31st May, 1861, he signed a Friendly Convention with the Resident, acting on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, by which he entered into a ' perpetual treaty of peace and friendship ' with Great Britain, and in which, as 'independent ruler of Bahrein,' he acknowledged as17 valid and in force the earlier conventions entered into between Bahrein and Her Majesty's Government, and undertook in return for a guarantee of protection against aggressions ' by the Chiefs and Tribes of the Gulf to abstain from maritime aggression, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c., and to agree to certain conditions in regard to residence and trade in Bahrein by British subjects and to No. x , 234. jurisdiction over them. One of the ships seized from him was thereupon returned; the second, the Hamrcih, was retained. 71. The Turkish and Persian agents would seem to have disappeared from PoL Res. to Bahrein before the Resident's arrival. The Persian authorities at Bushire in s.e.isei. June 1861 asked the Resident for an explanation of his proceedings. The Resident, however, contented himself with forwarding their enquiry to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. The Convention was approved by the Government of India in 1861, and the Turkish and Persian Governments were informed of what had happened. Summary, 1850-61 72. The Turkish Government were informed in 1851 that Her Majesty's Government could not recognise any claim on their part to Bahrein. The Sheikhs appear to have continued to pay tribute to the Wahabi Amir in the early part of and possibly throughout this period. In 1859 the Sheikh appealed simultaneously to Turkey and to Persia, as the result of apprehensions of a Wahabi attack, and received a Persian envoy, who hoisted the Persian flag. On the arrival immediately afterwards of the Turkish envoy the Persian flag was hauled down. Subsequently the Sheikh for a time flew both flags side by side. The envoys seem to have left Bahrein in the early part of 1861. No action was taken by the British authorities pending a decision by Her Majesty's Government as to whether they regarded Bahrein as independent. The Persian Government undertook not to endeavour to occupy the islands until the title to them was settled. Her Majesty's Government decided in February 1861 to regard the Sheikh as an independent ruler and so hold him responsible for piracies, &amp;c. Punitive action against him by Her Majesty's Government having proved necessary in May 1861, he entered in that month into a convention with them in which he was described as ' independent ruler of Bahrein/' and secured certain guarantees of protection. YIII.— 1861-67. From the Convention of 1861 to the Punitive Expedition of August 1868 Persian Protest (1862) 73. In January 1862 the Persian Minister in Paris protested to Her Lord Cowley Majesty's Ambassador in Paris against the seizure of the Hamrah. He was no. is,' informed in reply that Her Majesty's Government could not recognise any claim j 0 7 o 18 ^' on the part of Persia to question their proceedings in regard to Bahrein, and must Lord Cowley, therefore decline to offer him any explanation on the subject of his complaint. ^S Persian Protest (1866) 74. Between 1863 and 1865 the Sheikh continued to misbehave, and in the Lor. I, 891. latter year his ship, the Dinar, was seized under the instructions of the Resident. The Persian Government in 1866 made a complaint in regard to the Dinar proceedings on the ground that Bahrein under the unratified agreement of 1822 was a dependency ot Persia. The Government of India, after ascertaining from the Government of Bombay the nature of the agreement of 1822, communicated lor. i, 691. the result of their enquiries to the Minister at Tehran, and added their own opinion that 1 ' whatever might have been the pretensions of Persia or the grounds of the same to the sovereignty of Bahrein in former days, the Shah could not now be regarded as possessing in point of fact any rights in the principality.' This 10 ^ G of 1 communication was approved by Her Majesty's Government in the same year, and i&amp;.ise? the matter appears to have dropped. Nature of Relations between Bahrein and Wahabi Amir (1867) 75. In 1866-67 the Resident, on the instructions of the Government of India, investigated the relations of the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Wahabi Amir. He reported as a result that the Sheikh claimed to be independent so far as his islands 85—177 d18 Lor. I, 892. were concerned, and that the annual tribute of 4,000 dollars '' which he indubitably paid paragraph 50 above) to the Amir was on account of the possessions held by him in Qatar on the Arabian mainland, the object of the payment being to secure those possessions against attacks by Arab tribes under Wahabi influence. The Government of India, in the light of the Resident's investigation, expressed the view in March 1867 that the Sheikh was independent of all other Powers in respect of his insular possessions and owed fealty to the Wahabis only in regard to Qatar. Summary, 1861-67 76. This period is marked by assertions of the Persian claim in 1862 and 1866. Her Majesty's Government on both occasions made it clear that they could not regard that claim as well founded. Investigation showed that the tribute still paid (1867) by the Sheikh to the Wahabi Amir was in respect of Bahreini possessions on the mainland of Arabia, and not in respect of Bahrein, which the Sheikh held independently of all other Powers. IX.—Discussions and Incidents, 1868-70 77. Questions of considerable importance as bearing on the status of Bahrein arose in 1868-70 consequent on— the disciplinary action taken by the Government of India against the ruling Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, in view of his breaches of the Maritime Truce of 1820, which resulted in his flight from Bahrein in September in 1868 and the succession as sole Sheikh of his brother, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa; (6) the punitive action taken at Bahrein by the Government of India in November-December 1869, consequent on the invasion of Bahrein by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, the murder of Sheikh Ali and the attempt of Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa and Sheikh Md. bin Abdullaih to establish themselves in control of the islands. 78. In view of the weight attached by the Persians to the declarations made in the course of those discussions as indicating the view held by Her Majesty's Government on the status of Bahrein, of the Persian allegations that overtures to Persia had been made by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin Khalifa, and by the ex- Sheikh, Md. bin Khalifa, and of the misleading but categorical accusations made against the Resident by the Persian Government, it seems desirable to examine in some detail the correspondence which passed and the sequence of events. (a) Bushire Desp. 3 25.9.1868. of Aitch. XI, No. xi, 236-7. Pol. Res. to Govt, of Bombay, No. 3. 25.9.1868. Punitive Expedition of August-September 1868 79. In 1868, consequent on an attack on Qatar by the Sheikh of Bahrein, the Government of India resolved to take disciplinary action against Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa. The Sheikh sent an agent to Bushire to satisfy the Resident, but the agent having no powers from his master, his mission proved fruitless, and he returned to Bahrein in August 1868. An armed expedition was thereupon sent against the Sheikh in August-September of that year. Before it reached Bahrein the Sheikh fled to the Arab mainland, and he was thereafter regarded by the people of Bahrein and by Her Majesty's Government as having abdicated the Sheikhdom. The expedition found it unnecessary to use any force, a full submission being made on its arrival by Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa, brother of Sheikh Mohamed, who had previously been associated with Sheikh Mohamed to some extent in the Sheikhship. An agreement was reached by the Political Resident with Sheikh Ali, which disposed of the matters in dispute, on 6th September, 1868. The agreement was signed by ' Ali bin Khalifah and the inhabitants and subjects of Bahrein.' It declared inter alia that ' Md. bin Khalifah having repeatedly committed acts of piracy and other irregularities at sea, and having now, after his recent piratical acts, fled from Bahrein, has forfeited all claim to his title as principal Sheikh and Chief of Bahrein.' 80. Subsequently to the conclusion of this agreement the Resident, by way of punishment, destroyed the fort of Muharraq by gunfire and burnt certain vessels of war belonging to Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifah. His despatch, which contains a detailed report on the course of events, makes no reference to any flyingV \ 19 of the Persian flag by Mohamed bin Khalifah, and the bombardment of Muharraq and the punitive destruction of the warships took place after the submission 01 Bahrein, and so after Mohamed bin Khalifah had fled from the islands. Persian Protest, 'November 1868 81. The facts appear to be as stated in the preceding paragraph. It was some time before a full account of these proceedings reached either India or London. Meanwhile, as will be seen from the correspondence, extracts of which feh^Desp. to are quoted below, the action of the Government of India drew a vigorous protest 28.io.i8fe. from the Persian Government. The protest, after appealing to the treaties con- Teh. Desp. eluded between England and Persia in 1809, in 1814, in 1822 (unratified) and in 1711 0 ig68. 1857, urged that the Eesident, instead of respecting the rights of Persia in the Gulf to the extent provided for in those treaties had, without any prior intimation to the Persian authorities, attacked Bahrein, which island had been and still was the property of Persia; had bombarded and destroyed the Governors fort and house and caused considerable damage; had appointed the Sheikh s brother as Governor over the island on the flight, through fear, of the Sheikh; had imposed a fine; and had required the new Sheikh to find his brother and deliver him up to the British authorities. These proceedings had taken place at a time when ' Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah, the Governor of Bahrein, was openly avowing (his submission to and dependence upon Persia and declaring that he considered Bahrein to be indisputably Persian, in proof of which the Persian flag was flying over his fort.' 82. Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran was instructed to communicate a f . o _ to i.e., suitable explanatory statement to the Persian Government. The Foreign Office suggested, however, that it might be advisable, in the event of similar proceedings again becoming necessary, that communication should be had with that Govern ment. While this question was still under consideration a formal protest against the Resident's action was received (11th February, 1869,) from the Persian Charge d'Affaires in London, who complained, inter alia, that the Resident had sunk three ships belonging to the Governor of Bahrein and fired on his Palace on which the Persian flag flew, and requested that the British Government would give orders n^.iseo. for the repair of the damage caused. He was informed in reply that ' the Sheikh Mohsin Kh a n of Bahrein was an independent chief with whom the British Government had 5.3.1869. treaty engagements and whom they must hold strictly to the performance of those engagements.' 83. This contention the Persian representative disputed, and in support of |^ n an ^ h g^ ke his view he forwarded letters addressed ' from 1858 to 1869 by the Sheikh of of Argyll, Bahrein to His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Prince Governor of Shiraz.' 13.4.1869. The translations of these letters are dated 9th April and 12th April, 1869, respectively. From internal evidence it seems probable that they were, however, written in 1860 on the occasion of the visit to Bahrein of the Persian envoy, Mirza Medhi Khan (paragraph 67 above). They acknowledge the receipt of a Firman from the Mirza (apparently recognising Sheikh Md. as Sheikh and accompanying a Firman and a Sword of Honour for Sheikh Ali). They state emphatically that Bahrein forms part of Persia, and has always done so. They refer to an agreement reached for the future payment of tribute; remark that'' the slight neglect which was lately shown on our part towards Your Imperial Majesty's Government was because they had not for a while superintended and protected us, but as now the Government of Your Imperial Majesty has intended by sending over Mirza Mehdy to enquire into and manage the affairs here, I, with my brother and all the inhabitants, feel quite ready to declare at once that we are most willing to render any services required from us towards Your Majesty's Goverment, being already aware that Bahrein (Persian Gulf) is part of Persia,'' and add ' ... I will hasten to hoist the flag on my residence bearing the Lion and the Sun which are the signs of the Persian Standard.' British Note of 29th April, 1869 84. The question of the reply to be given to this further protest was carefully considered between the India Office and the Foreign Office. The Duke of Argyll, then Secretary of State for India, remarked that although he was of opinion that the line of policy which had hitherto been pursued of regarding the Sneikh of Bahrein as an independent sovereign, and of refusing to recognise the right of sovereignty advanced by Persia, as had been done in 1845, 1848 and 1860, could not be now abandoned without very serious risk of endangering the peace of the Gulf, yet that ' he was not blind to the expediency of avoiding all causes 85—177 I.O. to F.O., 21.4.1869.

Circum stances might, however, arise in which the Resident might, in the general interests of peace and order, be called upon to act promptly on his own responsibility, and in such cases the Secretary of State was not willing to waive what he considered 'as not only a right pertaining to, but a duty incumbent upon, the British Government.' The Foreign Office concurred in these views and the Persian representative was informed accordingly. 85. The Persian representative on receipt of the Foreign Office letter asked that in order to make it more palatable to the Shah, certain modifications should be made in it. After private discussion between Lord Clarendon and the Duke of Argyll, of which no record exists, and an interview between the Envoy and Lord Clarendon, it was finally agreed to accept the modification embodied in the opening paragraph of the letter which follows, but also to make the addition contained in the last paragraph of that letter; and a letter so amended was despatched to him. The text (omitting an introductory paragraph) of the amended letter, which is of importance as one of the principal pieces of evidence subsequently adduced by the Persian Government in support of their claim that Her Majesty's Government have recognised Persian sovereignty over Bahrein, is as follows. The sentences in italics are those which were added in deference to the further representations from General Mohsin Khan referred to above :— ' The British Government readily admit that the Government of the Shah has 'protested against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored hy the British Authorities, and they have rgiven dn£ consideration to that protest. But it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the Shah are undoubtedly aware, that the Sheikhs of Bahrein have at different periods entered directly into engagements with the British Government; and I beg to assure you that the British Government hold the Sheikh to these engage ments solely for the purposes of preventing Piracy and Slave Trade, and of maintaining the police of the Gulf. If the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf for these purposes, this country would be relieved of a troublesome and costly duty ; but, if the Shah is not prepared to undertake these duties. Her Majesty's Government cannot suppose His Majesty would wish that in those waters disorder and crimes should be encouraged by impunity. ' I need scarcely assure you of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty's Government towards Persia, and their desire on all occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shah; and, in regard to this question, I have the honour to state to you that, whenever it is practicable to do so, Her Majesty's Government will cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand of any measures of coercion against himself which the conduct of the Sheikh of Bahrein may have rendered necessary. ' But the British Government cannot consent to debar its officers, to whom the superintendence of the police of the Persian Gulf is entrusted, from the exercise of the right of punishing by prompt measures any violation of Treaty engagements by the Sheikh of Bahrein, when a reference to the Court of Tehran would be attended with embarrassing delays which might endanger the general peace of the Gulf; but whenever such a necessity shall arise a full communication respecting it shall be made to the Persian Government.' Overthrow and Death of Sheikh Ali [August-September 1869) 86. In August-September 1869 Bahrein was invaded by the ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah, who was joined by one Mohammed bin Abdullah, son of the Sheikh who had been deposed in 1843 (paragraph 39 above). The ruling Sheikh Ali was defeated and killed, while Sheikh Mohammed bm Abdullah assumed the leadership of the usurping party. 87. Her Majesty's Minister reported on 14th November, 1869, a conversation on this incident with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in the course of which the latter admitted that Persia had not acquired sufficient power or authority in that part of the Gulf to enable her to repress acts of piracy and to21 maintain order, but added that he hoped that before long the Shah s authority would be fully established at Bahrein, when full redress would be given for losses suffered through the recent events, and that in the meanwhile it would not be con sidered necessary that the British authorities should undertake coercive measures. Her Majesty's Minister further reported that ' Ali bin Khalifa having fowarded letters to this court admitting his allegiance to the Shah and offering his services to the Persian Government,' an agent (Mirza Medhi Khan, who had been Persian Envoy to Bahrein in 1859 (paragraph 67 above)) had been despatched with a Royal Firman, recognising Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah as Chief of Bahrein, but that on receipt of the news of the murder of the Sheikh by the ex-Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifah, the Firman had been recalled and the name of the ex-Sheikh substituted (from paragraphs 94^5 below it will be seen that these statements subsequently proved to be incorrect in material particulars). British Punitive Expedition (November-December 1869) 88. Punitive operations consequent on the murder of Sheikh Ali were '•V- undertaken by the British Government in November of the same year. Previous notification was given to the Persian Government of the grounds of this expedition, the object of which was stated to be 'to call the chief now in Pol. Res. to possession of Bahrein to account for his breach of the maritime peace and for the 1869^ attack on Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah, who had been placed in power by the British Government.' 89. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on receipt of the notification I5.ii.i869. in question stated that the ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah, who had, he said, been the cause of the recent disturbances, had been killed (this was in fact incorrect); that the Resident's action would therefore be useless, and that the Persian Government hoped that he would be telegraphically instructed not to proceed to Bahrein. He added that the Persian Government would themselves keep the affairs of Bahrein by land in order and that should anything happen to affect its affairs by sea they would request the British Government to send a naval Teh. Desp. 83 force to put affairs in order, '' but up till now the state of affairs in Bahrein had ^ I6.ii.i869. not fallen into disorder.' 90. The Persian agent referred to in paragraph 87 above, arriving in the Gulf at this stage, addressed letters to Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah (see paragraph 86 above) intimating his recognition as Sheikh, and despatched them by a special messenger, who proceeded to the island in a native boat belonging to a Persian. The messenger was, however, on his arrival prevented by the Resident from landing or communicating with the Sheikh, and his letters were Bushire Desp. detained and ultimately handed by the Resident to Sheikh Mohammed bin i5 6 12 0 5 869 Abdullah after the submission of that Sheikh, who returned them to Colonel Pelly 0 after perusal. The messenger stated that he had himself no authority from the Shah's Government and was deputed by the Chief of Dayer, who was acting in obedience to Mirza Mehdi Khan. Teh. Desp. No. 81, 14.11.1869. Submission of Usurping Sheikhs Sheikh Jsa bin Ali becomes Sheikh 91. The punitive operations against Bahrein resulted in the complete submission of Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah and the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Kalifah in Pol. Res. to September 1869. It may be remarked that prior to the opening of operations Sheikh Abdullah made overtures to the Resident, which were, however, rejected, oMLi.91869, with a view to securing recognition by Her Majesty's Government. He also 2591869 appealed to the Wahabi Amir for recognition and protection. Sheikh Isa bin 184 of ' Ali, son of the murdered Sheikh Ali, voluntarily assumed the vacant Chiefship 5101869 - and was recognised by the Resident on behalf of the Government of India (' in no way did Colonel Pelly influence the succession ') and the ex-Sheikh and Mohammed bin Abdullah were deported to India. Shortly after his installation the new Sheikh received a letter from one Hydar Khan, Zabit of the Dashti No.'94X district on the Persian coast, advising him to place himself under the Shah's 11121869 protection, but the incident appears to have been unimportant. n ? 7 D of P 12.1.1870. 4 Persian Protest , 1869-70 Views of Government of India 92. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs appears at first to have received news of the removal of the ex-Sheikh with equanimity and is said tohave remarked that Persia and Great Britain had an equal interest in the main tenance of peace by sea and that Persia had therefore no reason to object to the punishment of the delinquent. But he protested in strong terms against the Resident's action in preventing the Persian agent from landing and holding communication with the Sheikh, and a still stronger protest was made by the Persian Minister in London. The Government of India, in the exhaustive reports they submitted on the Resident's action, urged, after a review of the history of the islands, that the Shah had no legitimate control over the Sheikh of Bahrein; that his Government had, nevertheless, encouraged the piratical faction in the Persian Gulf by sending letters of recognition to the piratical leader; that in styling Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah Chief of Bahrein the Persian Government ignored the facts that he had never held sway in Bahrein, belonged to the younger branch of the ruling family, and so had neither by right nor possession claim to this title; and that, so far from the Shah having any just cause of complaint against the Resident, the Persian Government should be called upon to give some explanation of the conduct of its officers in encouraging a piratical expedition which was prejudicial to British interests in the Persian Gulf and for the successive appointment by them of Ali bin Khalifa and Md. bin Khalifa to the sovereignty of a district over which they had no legitimate control. The Government of India added that they had no confirmation of the alleged overtures of Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa to Persia (paragraph 87 above), as to which further enquiry was being made of Her Majesty's Minister (see paragraphs 94- 95 below), but in any event could not admit ' that such overtures, made without its knowledge and consent, can in any way affect its treaty relations with Bahrein.' British Reply to Persia, March 1870 93. Her Majesty's Minister was therefore instructed by the Foreign Office that it appeared possible that Her Majesty's Government, instead of furnishing explanations to Persia, might have cause to complain ' of the proceedings of the Persian authorities in endeavouring to communicate with a piratical chief who had been guilty of a breach of the Maritime Truce, and who had attacked the Chief placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government,' and was informed that no notice would be taken of the complaints against the Resident until the Persian Government gave a full explanation of the intercepted letters. Supplementary Reports by Her Majesty's Minister, Tehran, April 1870 94. On 6th April, 1870, the Minister at Tehran reported as follows to the Government of India :— ' In my Despatch No. 81. ... I reported that the Firman of appoint ment was originally in the name of Ali bin Khalifa, but that, on hearing of his death, it was altered in favour of his brother, Md. bin Khalifa. This information had reached me from a relation of . . . one of the principal Persian officials in Shiraz, and not . . . from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. When further intelligence reached Shiraz from the Gulf and it was supposed that Md. bin Abdullah would retain possession of Bahrein, the Firman was probably again altered in his favour, as it was to him that it was eventually forwarded. In conversation with the Persian Minister this afternoon. His Excellency admitted that this was probably the case. He said that Mirza Mehdi Khan on leaving Tehran had received general instructions for his guidance respecting the Bahrein question, but that the details were settled at Shiraz and the Firman was issued in the name of the Persian Governor of Fars and not in that of the Shah. The name inserted in this document had certainly, he said, been altered once to his knowledge, and it was not unlikely that it had been changed a second time before being forwarded to its destination. ' With regard to the overtures said to have been made by Ali bin Khalifa to the Persian Government, as reported in my Despatch No. 81, I have the honour to state that that information also reached me from' a private source and not from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His Excel- ency has, however, asserted very positively to me to-day that Ali bin Khalifa lad repeatedly written to the Persian Government professing allegiance to the Shah and that a number of letters containing assurances of this kind are now in his (the Minister's) possession. It appears to me that on the receipt of a correspondence which passed last April between Her Majesty's Government and the Shah's representative23 #' ^ s in London, the Persian Ministers, believing that the Bahrein Chief was him self well disposed to further their designs, resolved to take measures with a view to establishing, if possible, the Shah's authority in that quarter and make good his claim to exercise sovereign rights over Bahrein. Mirza Mehdi Khan was accordingly dispatched to Shiraz and Bushire and a certain latitude was given to him as to the mode in which he should proceed to carry out the wishes of his Government. The Persian authorities in Shiraz finally determined that a Firman should be addressed to Md. bin Abdullah, conferring upon him the government of Bahrein and with this the Khan hoped to be able to come to terms with the Chief then in possession of the place. But in this matter the sole object of all concerned would seem to have been to carry out the policy of the Persian Government at Bahrein without reference to the interests or wishes of Her Majesty's Government in that quarter.' 95. On 8th April, 1870, the Minister at Tehran addressed the following despatch to the Government of India :— ' With reference to my despatch of the 6th instant, in which I stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed me that Ali bin Khalifa had repeatedly made overtures to Persia admitting his allegiance to the Shah, I have the honour to report to Your Excellency that Mirza Sayed Khan has just sent to inform me that he was mistaken in making this assertion, and that he finds on enquiry that the letters to which he referred were not from that Chief, but from Md. bin Khalifa.' Views of Government of India, May 1870 96. ^ The Government of India, commenting on these facts, remarked that Mehdi Khan appeared to have left Tehran with a general discretion as to which of the various Sheikhs should be recognised as ruler. ' At the capital no more definite plan appears to have been resolved on than that measures should be adopted to establish the Sheikh's assumed right of sovereignty over the island.' 97. The Government of India proceeded that they had already pointed out that any disposition to admit the claims of Persia would probably lead to the revival of similar claims on the part of Turkey, a result which had^in fact now been brought about {cp. paragraph 99 below). ' This {i.e., the Turkish) claim rests on no better foundation than that of Persia. It was summarily rejected by Lord Palmerston in 1851 and in our opinion should not again be reopened. With equal reason the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat could claim the sovereignty of the island, if the nominal and temporary tender of allegiance, in times of difficulty, and as a security against foreign intervention be considered sufficient ground on which to base such pretensions. On the same ground indeed we might claim Bahrein as a part of the British dominions. But' as we have repeatedly observed, the real status of the island, and the only one' which we have recognised and admitted, or are prepared to recognise and admit, in all our dealings in the Persian Gulf and our negotiations with the Chiefs, is that of an independent State, subject neither to Persia nor to Turkev, neither to the Wahabis nor to Muscat, nor yet to the British Government. Review of Discussions of 1868-70 98. J he matter ultimately lapsed. But from the facts and the correspon dence summarised above it will be seen, in the first place, that there appears to be no foundation for the alleged overtures to Persia by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin Khalifa, or for the statement that the Persian flag was flying at the time of the punitive expedition of 1868; and that if any overtures were made to Persia in 1868-69 (and there is no confirmatory evidence of any such overtures) they would appear to have been made by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, presumably in his anxiety to secure Persian support for his restoration. Secondlv, while the statements contained in the Note sent by the Foreign Office on behalf of Her Majesty's Government to the Persian Charge d'Affaires on 29th April, 1869. were widely phrased, and afford some justification for the interpretation placed on them by Persia, and while the Persians may have been confirmed in their view • 1?^ i 01 ^ an ^ P rotest by Her Majesty's Minister against the mission of Mirza Mehdi Khan, the terms of that Note do not, in fact, constitute more than a recognition that Persia had in the past repeatedly pressed her claim to Bahrein, and that Her Majesty's Government did not claim sovereignty over that island G. of I. Desp. No. 28 of 20.5.1870.24 and interested themselves in its affairs only to the extent necessary to discharge their treaty obligations to its rulers (which included a guarantee of defence against external aggression) and to ensure the peace of the Gulf. Finally, that wliile Her Majesty's Government agreed to notify Persia, when circumstances permitted, before taking punitive action against Bahrein, on the only occasion on which (immediately after) they appear to have given effect to this undertaking, the terms of their communication made it clear that they regarded themselves as at liberty to punish the usurping Sheikhs Md. bin Abdullah and Md. bin Khalifa (in accordance with the obligations assumed by them under the Treaties of 1820 and 1861 with Bahrein) for their piratical attack on Bahrein and murder of the Chief placed in power there by the British Government. X.—1870-80. From the Turkish Occupation of Hasa to the First Exclusive Agreement Turkish Protest, 1870 99. In January 1870 a protest was received from the Turkish Government ^ f .o. to i .e., against the recent actions of the Resident at Bahrein. In reply the Turkish IWlfo 0, Government were informed that Her Majesty's Government could not recognise Lor. i, 901. the Turkish claim to sovereignty over Bahrein; and were courteously reminded of the intimation made to them in 1851 on Lord Palmerston s instructions (para graph 61 above). Turkish Occupation of Hasa. British Assurances to Bahrem, 1871 100. In 1871 the Turks occupied Hasa. Protests at Constantinople in April and May 1871 against rumoured Turkish designs on Bahrein resulted in a repudiation by Turkey of any such designs. The assurances received from the Turkish Government were communicated to the Sheikh of Bahrein, who had asked Her Majesty's Government for their advice and their protection against Lor. i, 902. the Turks in May 1871, and he was informed that so long as he observed the provisions of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70 above) the reciprocal obliga tions towards him of Great Britain would be fulfilled. 101. Protests about the same time at Constantinople led to a Turkish Lor. i, 919. repudiation of the designs which the Turkish Government were alleged to have entertained at Bahrein, and the Turkish authorities in Hasa were given instructions by their Government which debarred them from approaching Bahrein. In May 1871 the Shah enquired from Her Majesty's Representative at Tehran as to the probable effect on Bahrein of the Turkish occupation of Hasa and was informed in reply of the assurances which had been given to Her Majesty's Government by the Turks. Reply to Persian Legation at Constantinople as io meaning of British Note of April 1869 102. In November 1871 the Secretary of the Persian Legation at Constan tinople made enquiries of Her Majesty's Ambassador in connection with a rumour that a Turkish expedition was to be sent for the reduction of Bahrein, ' which island the Persian Secretary stated had been acknowledged by the Hertsiet, 28. British Government as a portion of the Persian dominions and ... in proof of cp. g . of i. this assertion he had handed to Sir H. Elliott a copy of the note which Lord Clarendon addressed to General Haji Mohsin Khan on 28th April, 1869. Sir H. Elliott, however, observed that he saw in that note nothing more than an acknowledgment that the claim had previously been made, but that he was unwilling to discuss the point, as he believed there was no danger of any attempt being made to interfere with the position of Bahrein as it then stood.' Turkish Claims, 1871-79 103. Consequent on the murder of a Turkish messenger in Bahrein in August or September 1871, the Turkish Government demanded reparation direct from the Sheikh and received a conciliatory reply. On their demand being pressed the Sheikh, on the advice of the Resident, suggested that the matter be arranged between the British and the Turkish Governments, by whose joint decision he would abide, but the Turkish Government preferred that it should be settled direct by the parties by agents. Her Majesty's Government saw no objection to such a procedure so long as no compulsion or show of force by Turkey was involved. The Turks, however, let the matter drop. The incident is of some interest as iif A - J 9i. I fc*! / 25 illustrating the view taken by Her Majesty's Government of the Sheikh as an independent ruler who might deal direct with foreign Powers. 104. In August 1872, a further complaint having been received from Turkey of British proceedings in regard to Bahrein and the commission of 'acts of sovereignty ' on the part of the English, the Ambassador was informed in i 0 . 1 ? reply that enquiries would be made into the point raised by him and that his Ambassador, (lovernment might rest assured that it was not the intention of Her Majesty's ^. 818 J 2 (government to interfere in the affairs of the Persian Gulf beyond what was I f q imposed upon them by treaty for the preservation of peace in the waters. The 30.7.1872. Ambassador was finally informed in April 1873, after investigation, that there were no grounds whatever for the statement that the British Government had attempted to exercise acts of sovereignty over Bahrein. 105. In 1874, consequent on a Turkish claim to conscript Bahreinis resident in Basra, the 1 urkish Ambassador in London was referred to the British Notes of 1851 and 1870 (paragraphs 61 and 99 above), which stated that Her Majesty's Government did not admit the claims of Turkey to consider Bahrein as part of the Ottoman dominions. In the same year, on a piratical attack being made PI 1 the island by certain Bahreini exiles who had signed a petition claiming i urkish protection, the Ambassador at Constantinople handed a memorandum to the Porte in which it was stated that Her Majesty's Government could not recognise any rights or pretensions of the Porte over Bahrein. In 1875 a rumour that Her Majestv's Government were fortifying Bahrein led to representations Lor. i, 914. from Turkey. The rumour was unfounded and the Turks were so informed. On its becoming known about the same time that the Turks themselves contemplated Lor. I, 915. building a lighthouse on the island, the British Government entered a protest at Constantinople (October 1875), with the result that the project was abandoned. 106. In 1876, consequent on steps taken by the Turkish authorities to enforce the claims of Qatar merchants against Bahreinis, a Note was addressed to th.- Porte reminding them of the determination of Her Majesty's Government to protect Bahrein against any attack on its independence. 107. In 1879-80 the Turkish Government took up the cause of the rebels of 1869. Her Majesty's Government, after again disclaiming the exercise of Lor i 915 sovereignty over Bahrein, which they regarded, they said, as independent, promised to make enquiries as to certain acts of which complaint was made bv petitioners to the Turkish Government. i _ ^ * 'v First Executive Agreement between Her Majesty's Government and the Sheikh of Bahrein (1880) 108. In 1S80 the Political Resident, finding that the Sheikh was disposed 00 u s P. ecia ^ arr angement with the British Government, entered on the z2n(i December into what is known as the First Exclusive Agreement with him By this Agreement the Sheikh undertook on behalf of himself and his successors in the Go\et nment of Bahrein to the British Government to abstain from enterin (; into negotiations or making treaties of anv sort with anv State or Government other than the British without the consent of the said British Government, and to re 1 use permission to any other Government than the British to establish diplomatic ot consular agencies or coaling depots in our territorv, unless with the consent of the British Government. This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities of neio-h- bourmg States on business of minor importance.' The agreement was approved by Her Majesty s Government and ratified in 1881. Summary, 1870-80 tj 1( i 9 ' cl , aims of .i lle Wahabi Amir disappear with the subjugation of Hasa by the Furks in 1871. The Turkish claim was repeatedly pressed during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty's Government. I he 1 ersian claim appears to have been dormant. &lt; t Her Majesty's Government repudiate suggestions that they have committed acts of sovereignty and continue to express their view that the Sheikh m an independent ruler. In 1880 the Sheikh entered into his first exclusive agree- ment with Her Majesty s Government. &amp; 85—177 Aitchison, Vol. XI, No. xxii, 237.26 Lor. T, 919. Teh. tel. 188, 27.9.1886.

From the conclusion of the First to the conclusion of the Second Exclusive Agreement with Her Majesty's Government Persian Demarche, 1886 110. In September 1886 the Shah sent a verbal message to Her Majesty's Government through the Minister at Tehran that he considered the communica tion made to him in April 1869 as tantamount to an admission of his rights in Bahrein and that he was anxious to establish his authority effectually over the islands either by sending a Governor to Bahrein or possibly by recognising the Sheikh as representative of Persian authority, but that he wished the maritime police to remain in the hands of the British authorities. An answer was prepared' by Her Majesty's Government to the effect that they did not concur in His Majesty's interpretation of the communication of April 1869. They had treaty engagements with the Sheikh, whom they considered to be independent, and must hold the Sheikh to his engagements while fulfilling those they had contracted towards him. As, however, the Shah did not return to the subject, the message was not delivered. 111. In the same year presents sent from the Persian Governor of Lar to the Sheikh were returned to the sender. 112. In 1887-88 Persian intrigues took place with a view to the establish ment of Persian influence on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. These were of little importance in the case of Bahrein, but it may be recorded that it appears that in the case of that principality the Persian Government had sanctioned a scheme for the seizure of Bahrein by Sheikh Jasim of Dohah in Qatar, who had seemingly undertaken to put the Persians in possession of the Sheikhdom Two British ships were in February 1888 stationed off Bahrein, with instructions to prevent by force any hostile attempt to land by the Turks, Arabs or Persians, and the Minister at Tehran was asked by the Government of India so to inform the Persian Government. As, however, the Amin-us-Sultan, 'on beinc- questioned disavowed all designs on Bahrein, Her Majesty's Minister thought it better to avoid the reference to forcible action.' Warning to Turkey, 1888 113. In March 1888 the Turkish Government were informed that any attempt to effect a landing in Bahrein would be opposed by force, and that no claim by the Porte to jurisdiction over Bahrein could be 'adtoiitted, since Her Majesty's Government regarded the Sheikh as an independent ruler with whom they were in treaty relations. Aitchison (1933), Vol. XI, No. xiii, 238. Const. Desp. No. 348 of 15.11.1892. Second Exclusive Agreement between Her Majesty 's Government and Bahrein (1892) . 114. On 13th March, 1892, the Political Resident signed a second Exclusive Agreement with the Sheikh of Bahrein on behalf of Her Majesty's Government. The provisions of the Agreement (which was ratified on 12th May, 1892, and which was expressed to be binding on the Sheikh, his heirs, and successors) were as follows :— (1) 1 hat I will on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government. (2) I hat without the assent of the British Government I will not consent to the residence within my territory of the agent of any other Government. (3) ' That I will on no account cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory, save to the British Government.' Further Warning to Turkey, November 1892 115. In November 1892 the Ottoman Government were warned (apropos of the position of Bahreinis at Basra) that Bahrein was under British protection, and that no interference with its natives by the Ottoman authorities could be admitted. In the same year the Porte was informed, with reference to a rumoured intention to land lurkish troops, that such action would be opposed by Her Majesty's ships.\ 27 Summary, 1880-92 116, The Turkish claim was again pressed vigorously during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty's Government. The Shah raised the question of the Persian claim in 1886, but did not press the matter. In 1892 the Sheikh entered into his Second Exclusive Agreement with Her Majesty's Government. XII.—1892-1913. From the Second Exclusive Agreement to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 British repudiations of Turkish Claims, 1892-98 117. In 1895 steps were taken at Constantinople by Her Majesty's Govern ment to check an attempted invasion of Bahrein from Q a t ai \ which seemed not Lor. I, 935. improbably to have been inspired by the Turks, and later in the same year Her Majesty's Government twice reiterated to the Porte that Bahrein was under British protection and that no interference with it would be tolerated. The views of Her Majesty's Government on the status of the island were again officially repeated at Constantinople on two occasions in 1896. In 1897 the Con stantinople Board of Health proposed to establish a sanitary post in Bahrein. The proposal was abandoned on the objections of the British delegate, who represented that Bahrein was an independent principality under British protection. 118. In 1898 a Turkish request that a British Vice-Consul alleged to have been appointed at Bahrein should apply to the Turkish Government for his exequatur was refused on the ground that Her Majesty's Government could not adtarit the right of the Turkish Government to insist that a British Consular Lor. i, 936. Officer in Bahrein should be provided with a Turkish exequatur. In 1899 the Minister at Tehran informed the French representative at that capital that since 1880 the Sheikh was precluded by treaty from holding direct relations with any Power other than Her Majesty's Government and that his subjects abroad were now under British protection. 119. A native British Agent had for a long period of years been maintained in Bahrein. In 1900 a British Political Agent was appointed at Bahrein. The post has been maintained since that date, and has been filled by an officer of the Indian Political Department since 1904. T he I ncident of 1901 120. On 31st August, 1901, a Belgian customs official in the service of the Lor. i. 935 -6 Persian Government visited Bahrein, where he called on the Sheikh and informed him that he had been deputed by the Shah to obtain his consent to place Persian custom officials in Bahrein. An official protest was at once madie by His Majesty's Minister to the Persian Government in the course of which Sir A. Hardinge remarked that no intimation had been given to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ' of this Persian mission to an Arab State under British protec tion and bound by special treaties, of which the Persian Government cannot be ignorant, to the Government of India .... It is my duty to place on record Teh. Desp. in the clearest manner that His Ma jesty the Emperor of India cannot acquiesce ^ ^ of in any foreign interference in the affairs of Bahrein .... and that any attempt to disturb the relations established by treaties of long standing between those Chiefs and the Government of India will be regarded as an unfriendly act.' The Attabeg-i-Azam, in a note received on 17th September, 1901, replied : ' As I have told you verbally, M. Simais has had no instructions from the Persian Government on this matter, and if there have been any steps on his part it must have been by mistake and he will be reprimanded for it.' T he D isorders of 1904r-05 121. In 1904-05, consequent on a series of attacks on Persians and on Lor. 1, 938-42. German subjects in Bahrein, the Persians appealed to the Shah. The Persian Government replied that His Majesty's Government would take action on their behalf. The text of their telegram was as follows: 'To the Merchants and Traders of the High Government living in Bahrein. Your telegram on the subject of the assaults which have been made upon you by the Arab roughs of Bahrein has been received. Certainly let your minds be alt rest. Consultations 85—177 E 228 with the Knglish Legation have taken place on this subject, and it will shortly be settled in such a way that the oppression will be removed and that the offenders will receive their proper punishment.' 122. The Germans complained to the German Vice-Consul at Bushire, who made a direct request to the Sheikh for reparation, in reply to which he was referred by His Excellency to His Majesty's Government. The Sheikh was ultimately compelled by His Majesty's Government to give redress. Turkish Protest, 1904-05 Lor. i, 944. 123. On the Turks pressing in 1904-05 for an explanation of the action taken by His Majesty's Government in connection with the ill-treatment of the stantino So'' German subject, the Turkish Ambassador was informed by Lord Lansdowne No' 59 ^ l&gt; ' that it was a matter of common knowledige and well known to the Turkish 22.2.1905. Government, that His Majesty's Government had direct relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein; that the island and its natives were under British protection; and that His Majesty's Government were within their rights in taking measures to obtain redress for the outrage committed there. On the Ambassador reverting to the subject later in 1905, he was informed (20th May, 1905) that His Majesty's Government must decline to entertain any further representations from the Turkish Government on the subject. Reassertions of Persian Claim, 1905-13 124. In 1905 the Persians again reasserted their claim. On the 19th February, 1906, in reply to a further reiteration which appears to have been 19.2.1906. based on the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857, the Minister at Tehran informed the Persian Government that ' The Treaties of 1809, of 1814 and of 1857 on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty's Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty's Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein. Such a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible. His Majesty's Government consider the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and must decline to entertain any further representations on the subject. I am further to mention that this reply has invariably been made to the Ottoman Government, who have on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrein.' The Note concluded by a reference to the Persian appeal for our assistance in 1904-05 and quoted in extenso the telegram of reassurance (paragraph 121 above) to the Persian inhabitants of Bahrein then sent on behalf of the Persian Government. 125. On 13th September, 1906, the Persian Grand Vizier revived the Teh Desp. Persian claim in a letter referring to Captain Bmce's unauthorised agreement of a.i.ioo?* 1 ? 22 - He was reminded in reply that that agreement had been expressly disavowed by His Majesty's Government and that Captain Bruce had been Teh. Desp. recalled. In a supplementary note the Grand Vizier's attention was drawn to the 27 O 3i907 f ^ le t ^ en Shah himself had ' refused to recognise ' the stipulations of the Treaty of 1822, which had never been ratified, and had ' expressed his dis pleasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions.' 1 126. On the Ala-es-Sultaneh reviving the Persian claim, on the ground of Teh. Desp. the Agreement of 1822, in August 1907, his attention was drawn in a Note dated 1581907 of 13th Au g ust ' 1907 ' to the notes referred to in the preceding paragraph; and to the fact that the Agreement had been disavowed alike by His Majesty's Govern ment and by the Shah. The Note added that ' since 1822 the Turkish Government have raised claims on Bahrein, and, like the Persian Government, have been informed that Bahrein is under British protection.' Teh. tel. 95 127. In 1908 the Persian Government, in a correspondence regarding the of 11.4.1908. punishment of a Bahrein subject at Lingah, intimated that instructions had^been sent to Lingah that reparation should be made, but added that His Majesty's Minister would admit that ' the proprietary right of the Persian Government over the island is not a matter to be disputed.' The Note was returned as inadmissible to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A modified version was sub sequently accepted by His Majesty's Government, which was acknowledged by N o V o T ' a Note from His Ma .l est y' s Minister, reaffirming that His Majesty's Government 22 O i .i909. maintained as regards the status of Bahreinis in Persia the position that the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants were under Brtish protection, and that they would be guided entirely by their own views of the position should any action of the Persian Government make representations necessary.29 128. Early in 1910 the Persian Government assimilated the formalities to be fulfilled in the case of persons visiting Bahrein to those prescribed in the case of tra\ellers to Persian ports, a measure which, as pointed out by the Foreign Omce at the time, constituted a fresh attempt to assert Persian sovereigntv over Teh. Desp. the island, but it was agreed that in view of the undesirability of raising the general question no protest should be made to them. In July of the same year p. 3539/10. that internal Persian coastal passes issued to persons proceeding to Bahrein from Persian ports were vise by a Persian merchant residin' 1 in Bahrein. In 1912 the individual in question was forbidden to take any action in regard to the endorsement of passes held by Persian subjects for travelling in p g. 13, 67, aiiem. 1 he endorsements in question were, however, henceforth granted by the ^ 24 ' Political Resident—a practice, as pointed out by the Political Resident 'nine years later of itself open to objection, as it might be construed into a tacit admission that the Persian passport authorities are justified in giving passes for another Persian port to persons going to Bahrein.' » &amp; ^ Withdrawal of Turkish Claim to Bahrein in Anglo-Turkish ConYention of 29th July, 1913 / ^IS, His Majesty's Government signed a convention (which still awaited ratification on the outbreak of the War of 1914-18) with the Ottoman Government under which that Government renounced all their claims to the islands of Bahrein, the independence of which they recognised His Majesty s Government on their part declared that they had no intention of annexing the islands and undertook not to allow the Sheikh of Bahrein to disturb the autonomy of the peninsula of El Katr or to annex it, and to ensure that the feheikh should not discriminate against Ottoman subjects in the matter of dues levied upon pearl fisheries. 1 he Turkish Government on their side accented a reservation of the right of the population of Bahrein to visit Zakhnuniyah Island for fishing, and recognised the rights of subjects of the Sheikh to British consular protection in lurkey. 1 his arrangement, followed, as it was by the disarmear ance of Turkey from the Gulf after the War of 1914-18, disposed of the Turkfsh insistence since'1847.

In 1922 His Majesty's Consul at Bunder Abbas reported that the Persian passport officials at Lingah had ruled that Bahreinis were Persian subjects and should be given Persian passports. They seized two British certi ficates of identity granted to Bahrein subjects, but on representations being made by the Minister at Tehran instructions were given by the Central Government that there was to be no repetition of this incident. In 1922, also, the Persian delegate at a Postal Conference held at Bushire stated that while not for the moment pressing for the transfer to Persia of the Bahrein post office, his action was without prejudice to the Persian claim to Bahrein. 135. In 1923, consequent on a Press campaign and a discussion in the Majliss on the desirability of giving Bahrein the right to return a member to the Persian Parliament, which was referred to a Commission for report. His Majesty's Government decided that it was desirable to address a formal Note to the Persian Government in terms similar to those employed in 1906 (para graph 124 above). Owing to the difficult internal situation in Persia this proposal was dropped, but in September 1923 the Persian Government was informed that the island was now a British protectorate, and that His Majesty's Government did not contemplate any alteration of its status. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the Government of which he was a member had no intention of laying claim to Bahrein on behalf of Persia. But despite this state ment the Minister for Foreign Affairs again reverted to the question in the following month. His Majesty's Government remove Sheikh Isa for Mu gov eminent (1923) 136. Consequent on the gross mismanagement of Sheikh Isa, who had been ruler of Bahrein since 1869, the Sheikh was deprived by His Majesty's Govern ment of his control of affairs in Bahrein on 26th May, 1923, and was' granted an allowance, his son, Sheikh Hamad (whose right of succession had been recognised by His Majesty's Government in 1901) being appointed to act for him ' as his father's fully empowered agent.' Oil concession granted hy Sheikh, 1925 137. In 1925 an oil concession was granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein to the Eastern and General Syndicate, a British corporation, with the approval of His Majesty's Government. Undertakings secured from Ihn Saud in Treaty of Jedda, 1927. Persian Protest 138.^ The Treaty of Jedda, concluded on 20th May, 1927, between His Majesty s Government and Ibn Saud, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, in substitution for the Treaty of 1915 (paragraph 133 above), provided inter alia that 'His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies ' should maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of ... . Bahrein and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Government. Consequent thereon, a strong protest was received on 26th November, 1927, from the Persian Govern ment, copies of which were despatched to the League of Nations. The Persian protest was based essentially on the recognition stated to have been accorded to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein in Lord Clarendon's Note of 29th April, 1869 (paragraph 85 above). A reasoned reply to the Persian Note was despatched by His Majesty's Government on 18th January, 1928, and circulated to the League. While avoiding any definite statement as to their own position in Bahrein or its basis. His Majesty's Government in their Note repudiated the Persian claim in the strongest terms, and intimated that no argument such as was suggested could be based on the communication of 29th April, 1869. A ttitude of Sheikhs to Persian claim (1928) 139. The Sheikhs of Bahrein, on being apprised of the revival of Persia's claim, gave a letter to the Political Resident, requesting His Majesty's Govern ment in accordance with their treaties 'to defend Bahrein from outside interference ' and to act as their agents in rebutting the Persian claims and intimating that the Sheikhs proposed to send Sheikh Mohamed, brother of Sheikh Hamad, the deputy ruler and son of the deposed ruler, Isa, as their representative in answering the claim should the case be taken to Geneva.m 31 Further Persian Protest, 2nd August, 1928. 140. On 2iid August, 1928, the Persian Government communicated a p. 4184/28 lengthy and reasoned reply to the British Note of 18th January, 1928. The Note based its reiteration of the Per sian claim on the principle that territory belonging to a sovereign State could definitely be detached from that State only with 0 the consent ot the State m question, which had not been given in the case of Bahrein; and alleged that the terms of the Foreign Office Note of 29th April, 1869 were conclusive evidence of the view then held of the rights of Persia by His Majesty's Government; that Bahrein lhad consistently recognised Persian'sovereignty as could be proved by documentary evidence, up to the date when the Sheikhs were instigated to rebellion by a foreign Government; that no valid argument could be founded on the direct relations into which the Sheikhs had entered with His ajesty s Government, since their action had been without the approval of their suzerain; that tlie relations of Bahrein with Persia were more highly developed than with any other independent civilised country; that the Persian claim had !?r?aoo nS1SteI j y uninterruptedly pressed; and finally that even if the Treaty ,1, ' aS K i!fT 0 J's I' 8 Govenl ment, it was material evidence of llie view held by a British officer of great experience at the time of its con elusion, and that its disavowal by the then Shah of Persia was not because of any doubt on his pai t as to the true status of Bahrein. Ul A reasoned reply, which examined in detail the amumpn^ nnf forward by the Persian Government and reached the conclusion that the? were vyithout substance, was despatched and circulated to the League at the request of His Majesty's Government on 18th February. 1929. request ot Assignment of Bahrein Oil Concession to American Interests, 1930. Fresh Persian Protest r l4 f- On 23rd July 1930, the oil concession granted to the Eastern and ap^rovll of^be^eikb 192 ^ bee V s , s , i g Iled b y th at Corporation, with the &lt; ppioval of the Sheikh and His Majesty s Government, to the Bahrein Petroleum mpany (incorporated in Canada in 1929), an American-owned subsidiary of e . tandard Oil Company of California, a formal protest against such assign- ment was received from the Persian Government, based on the ground that Bahrein being Persian territory, neither the Sheikh nor His Majesty's Govern ment had any right to grant a concession. The protest reserved the right of Tw a claim damages Treaty negotiations were at the time proceeding with I ersia, and it was thought unnecessary to send any reply to this Note, which was Natfons' 01 ' at request of the Persian Government, to the League of P. 5723/30. Discussions between His Majesty's Government cund Persia, 1928-34 kctween 1928 and 1934 treaty negotiations, with a view to the con- usion of a general treaty which should dispose of outstanding points of difteience were in progress with Persia, the question of Bahrein figuriL Dr omi nently in those negotiation^ The general attitude token hy « f ln vf S a P0mt u great lm P or ^nce to them, but that in return for Mai -tV r ' qUO K r0 7 — be P re P ared to abandon their claims.

On 17th March 1934 Hk aJ r S V f tt 61 , . ,ehran communicated copies of certain treaties and a^ree- meius between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India on tJhe one hand, and certam Arab Rulers on the other, to the Persian Minister for cu ,(jn Affairs. In his acknowledgment Mirza Bagher Khan Kazemi rem-irk^d tnat the Persian Government did not consider those of the agreements, treaties fi 3 !?^ 224 ^ and concessions in question which related to lands and places such as Bahrein &amp;c. winch are inseparable parts of Persian territory, to be either official oi' tt - y p . ji' S i re ? T iVIajesty s Minister said that he was instructed, as s I ; xcellency had thought fit to mention Bahrein, 'to emphasise once more E - 5955 / 224 0/ that m the view of His Majesty's Government, the Persian claim to these islands ' 1934 is entirely inadmissible.'32 Confidential 14628, 1934. pz. 4902 /33. 144. In 1932 tJhe Persian Government protested to His Majesty's Govern ment against the issue of British Indian postage stamps surcharged ' Bahrein,' and repeated their protest to the League. Their protest was rejected by His Majesty's Government, and the stamps were issued in August, 1933. The Bahrein Petroleum Com'pany's Concession 145. The interest of the Persian public in Bahrein during 1934 had been aroused by articles in British and foreign newspapers dealing with the activities of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd., which had just struck oil and was beginning production. Outbursts in the Persian press provoked a statement in the Majlis by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in which he said that he had addressed a Note to the United States Minister in Tehran pointing out that the Standard Oil Company's concession was null and void, since it had not been obtained from the Persian Government, whose claim to Bahrein was indisputable. Copies of this Note were circulated to all members of the League of Nations at the request of the Persian Government. In reply His Majesty's Government requested the Secretary-General of the League to refer to the British Notes of 18th January, 1928, and 18th February, 1929, and to circulate this reply to the States Members of the League. In that year His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, in his despatch of 7th April, reviewed the state of our relations with the Persian Government and, in particular, the means by which a general treaty settlement miglht be secured. In the course of this review he remarked upon the unsatisfactory situation resulting from the assertions of His Majesty's Government that the Persian claim to Bahrein was 'worthless.' while the existence of the claim continued, nevertheless, to hamper freedom of action at every turn. He further expressed the opinion that there was little hope of reaching a general settlement until the Shah was '' forced to believe that we are determined, treaty or no treaty, to settle the Bahrein issue once and for all.' E. 4472/2369/ 91, 1934. E.2539/139/ 34, 1934. XIY.—Summary 146. It may be convenient at this stage to summarise very briefly the claims to sovereignty over tlhe islands which have been advanced by various countries since 1783; the particular basis of those claims in the case of Persia (whose claim is alone at the present time of any importance); and the basis and development of the attitude of His Majesty's Government. A.—-Claims to or Assertions of Sovereignty over Bahrein, 1873-1934 147.— {a) Muscat. —Bahrein subject to Muscat 1800-01, 1811 ? to 1816, 1820-22. Tribute paid to Muscat 1820. Bahreini independence recognised by Treaty 1829. Muscat thereafter deterred by Hi^ Majesty's Government from pursuing its claims. (6) Egypt. —-Representative of Mehemet Ali, Viceroy of Egypt, informed by Her Majesty's Government in 1839 that no claim upon Bahrein could be admitted. But in 1839-40 the Sheikh acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and he paid tribute during this period. (c) Wahabi Amirs of the Arab Mainland.— under protection of or subject to Wahabi Amirs 1803-11; 1816; 1830-33 (tributary); 1836-1838-39 (tributary); 1847 (tributary); 1852 (tribute). In 1867 (see paragraph 75) it was held by Government of India that tribute was paid to the Wahabis only in respect of mainland possessions and not of Bahrein. The claims of the Amirs disap peared with the conquest of Hasa by Turkey in 1871. {d) Turkey. —The islands have neverln the period subsequent to 1783 been occupied by Turkey or (if the incidents of 1860-61 (paragraphs 67-9 above) are ignored) subject to Turkish sovereignty. But Turkish claims to them were advanced, directly or indirectly, in 1847, 1851, 1870, 1874, 1875, 1876, 1879, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1895, 1896 and 1905, and on each occasion, save in 1847, when certain assurances were given by Turkey (paragraph 52), were rejected by the British Government. The Turkish claim was finally withdrawn in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. That Convention was never ratified, but the withdrawal of the claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the I reaty of Lausanne of 1923. {e) Persia. —The Persian claim has been consistently urged on a variety of occasions through the period in question. The Sheikhs momentarily submitted themselves to Persia in 1799 and paid tribute. In 1816-17 they received a33 Persian envoy and apparently appealed for help to Tehran. They again momentarily submitted to Persia and received an envoy in 1839. Persian aid was invoked and a Persian emissary received at Bahrein in 1860-61, while in 1869 the deposed ex-Sheikh Mdhammed bin Khalifa may have made overtures to Persia (though there is no confirmation of this) to enable him to re-establish his control over the island. The Persian claim appears, apart from this, to have been asserted in 1822, 1825, 1844, 1848, 1861, 1862, 1866, 1868, 1869, 1886, 1901, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1910, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1932-33 and 1934, and to have been rejected by His Maiesty's Government in 1822 (as part of tlheir refusal to accept Captain Bruce's Treaty), 1825, 1844, 1848, 1861, 1862, 1866-67, 1869, 1901, 1906, 1907, 1908-09, 1923, 1928, 1929, 1933 and 1934. B.—Basis of the Persian Claim 148. Ignoring contentions such as that the use of the term ' Persian Gulf is a recognition of Persian sovereignty over the various islands of the Gulf Persia has at one time or other based her claim on the nine grounds examined below ;— (1) History of the Islands 'prior to 1783 The history of the islands prior to the expulsion of the Persians in 1783 is dealt with in paragraphs 3 to 5 above. It will be seen that at various periods since the beginning of the Christian era, Persia has exercised a degree of control over the islands, and in particular that during the 30 years prior to 1783 her control was of a more definite character. On the other hand, the facts recorded above do not support any claim by Persia to an uninterrupted occupation or control of the islands. i v- * Persia has on various occasions in the past appealed to the early history oi Bahrein in support of her claim that it is historically Persian territory. Since 1930, too, certain Persian newspapers, presumably inspired, have dealt at con siderable length with the history of Bahrein in the more or less remote past, and have supported their statements by quotations from, or references to, Arab or Persian geographers or historians. Owing to the absence of records and the shortness of time available, it has been impossible to check these statements in detail, or to conduct elaborate researches into the writing of Arab geographers and others from which further information might be secured. But it is arguable that the position of the islands prior to 1783 is at most only of very indirect importance in the present connection. The essential weakness in the Persian claim is, it is suggested, that there has been no effective exercise of authority in the islands by Persia since her expulsion in 1783, and that the Sheikhs, who originally established themselves by conquest, have now acquired a prescriptive title, based on an uninterrupted occupation of 150 years by the present ruling family. (2) The A bsence of Persian Consent to the Detachment of Bahrein from Persia ■ The Persian Government, in paragraph 2 of their Note of 2nd August, 1928 (Appendix I, Paper B), invited attention to 'the following international juri dical principle. ... A territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue of an official act, in this case a treaty, or so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory.' They added (correctly) that Persia has never renounced her sovereignty or ceded it to another State or ever recognised any of the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers. The argument put forward by the Persian Government under this head is examined in detail in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Note despatched by the Foreign Office on 18th February, 1929, in reply to the Persian Note of 2nd August, 1928 (Appendix I, Paper B). His Majesty's Government expressed their inability to agree that any such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, formed part of international law. The deciding factor in the question of international title in cases in which territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign is the effective establishment by that territory of its inde pendence, ' and in the case of Bahrein His Majesty's Government regard as wholly untenable the proposition that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been 85—177 Findependent of Persia and during which no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the Persian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence.' In paragraph 7 of the same Note His Majesty's Government cite historical precedents to show that the theory of the necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State is not one which has ever obtained international acceptance. (3) The Unratified Treaty of 1822 The circumstances in which the Treaty of 1822 was concluded by Captain Bruce with the representative of the Prince Governor of Shiraz are set out in paragraphs 20-21 above. As will be seen, Captain Bruce concluded it without the authority of or reference to Government. The treaty into which he had entered was immediately officially disavowed, and the Persian Government so informed, and Captain Bruce, as a sign of disapproval of his action, was removed from his appointment. The Persian Government on their side equally disapproved the action of the Prince Governor of Fars in entering into any treaty discussions without the prior approval of the Shah. [ The Persian Goverment were reminded of this in 1825, 1845, 1866, 1907, 1928 and 1929. | It appears impossible in these circumstances to base any legitimate claim to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein on the provisions of the Treaty of 1822. (4) The Gold Coin alleged to have been struck at Bahrein in 1817 Please see paragraph 47 above. A Persian Mission appears to have visited Bahrein in 1816 or 1817 (paragraph 9 above) and it is conceivable that a coin might have been struck on that occasion. On the other hand, it would probably be extremely difficult to prove that the coin had not in fact been struck elsewhere, though with an indi cation that it had been minted at Bahrein. The incident is in itself of relatively small importance, and it would, it is suggested, be impossible for Persia to use such an incident, even if it could be proved, save in support of arguments of much more substantial character. (5) Payment of Peeshkesh, Offerings or Tribute at various Stages by Bahrein to Persia From paragraph 6 above it will be seen that tribute appears to have been paid by Bahrein to Persia in 1799. The rulers of Bahrein may also have offered to pay tribute in 1839 (paragraph 32) and appear to have offered to do so in 1860 (paragraph 67). In assessing the importance of the payment of tribute in 1799, or, if it then took place, in 1839 or 1860, it is relevant that such payment or promise of payment was immediately followed by the submission of the rulers of Bahrein, in 1800 to Muscat, in 1839 to the Egyptians, and in 1860 to the Turks. In estimating the importance of such payments as evidence of a recognition of Persian suzerainty, the arguments advanced by Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran in his Despatch No. 28 of March 1845, in which Colonel Sheil remarks that the Chiefs of Bahrein ' had in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to Persia as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat still continue to do, without an acknowledgment of subjection '; and the comment thereon of the Secret Committee of the East India Company that ' presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia '' are also relevant. (6) Flying of the Persian Flag by the Sheikh of Bahrein (a) The Persian flag was hoisted by the Sheikh of Bahrein in 1860. But as will be seen from paragraph 67 above, hardly had it been hoisted when, on the arrival of a Turkish emissary, it was lowered and the Turkish flag hoisted in its place. At a later stage in 1860-61 the Persian and Turkish flags were apparently flown side by side by the Sheikh. It appears difficult in these circumstances to base any substantial argument on the incident. {b) The Notes addressed by the Persian envoy in London to the Foreign Office in February 1869 alleged that the Persian flag had been hoisted by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and that the Resident had in September 1868 bombarded the Sheikh s palace on which the flag was flying. There appears to be no foundation for the suggestion that the Persian flag was flying when the Resident reached Bahrein or that it was fired on (see paragraph 80). If previously hoisted it had, by the time of the Resident's arrival, been hauled down.35 (c) In the undated letters from Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah communicated to the Foreign Office by the Persian envoy in April 1869, the Sheikh stated that he was hoisting the flag of the Lion and Sun over Bahrein. If, as seems probable from internal evidence, these letters date from the period of the abortive Persian Mission to Bahrein of 1860-61, it is relevant in assessing their importance that immediately after the reception of the Persian envoy, a Turkish envoy was received, the Persian flag hauled down and the Turkish flag substituted, and that in the early part of 1861 the flags of Persian and Turkey appear to have been flying side by side on the forts at Bahrein. There is nothing to show that either fla^r flew in Bahrein between the conclusion of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70) and 1868. (2) In September 1869 the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah attacked the islands, and with the assistance of Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah killed the ruling Sheikh Ali. The Persian flag may have been hoisted on this occasion. But there is no reference to this in the detailed reports of the capture of the islands by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah, or of the operations as the result of which those Sheikhs were reduced at the end of 1869. (Enclosure to ^ Government of India's Despatch No. 7lof 25th January, 1870; Resident's Despatches of 11th September, 25th September, and 5th October, 1869.) (7) Letters from fast Rulers of Bahrein admitting Persian Suzerainty It is by no means improbable that in 1799, 1816-17, and 1839, the rulers of Bahrein addressed letters to the Persian Government acknowledging Persian suzerainty over the island, and they appear certainly to have done so in 1860. But the only letters the text of which has ever been communicated to Her Majesty's Government are the two letters communicated by the Persian envoy in London in 1869. Those letters indeed categorically acknowledge Persian suzerainty over Bahrein and state that it has been uninterruptedly exercised in the past. But they appear to date from 1860, and the submission of Bahrein to Turkey and the hauling down of the Persian flag in the same year are, it is suggested, material in assessing the weight to be attached to them. (8) Declarations made hy Her Majesty's Government to the Persian Minister in London, April 1869 {a) These declarations are examined in paragraph 98 above. The text of the Note addressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Persian envoy on 29th April, 1869, on which the subsequent Persian claims have to a considerable extent been based, is given in paragraph 85 above. The wording of that Note, and the general attitude adopted by Her Majesty's Government, as evidenced by their acquiescence in the despatch of a mission to Bahrein by Persia, undoubtedly afforded Persia justification for the inferences she appears to have drawn. But, as pointed out in paragraph 10 of the Note addressed to the Persian Minister on 18th February, 1929, and reproduced in Appendix I, Paper B, the Note in question, while very loosely expressed, was never intended to bear the interpretation now placed upon it by the Persian Government {cp. in this connection paragraphs 102 and 110 above), and in stating that due considera tion had been given in the past by Her Majesty's Government to the Persian claim it did not in any way admit that that claim was valid. The Note, indeed, confirmed the intention of the British Government to continue to hold the Sheikhs to the treaty engagements which had been entered into with them as independent rulers. {h) The undertaking given by Her Majesty's Government in the same corres pondence to communicate in future with Persia before undertaking punitive action against the rulers of Bahrein is prima facie consistent with a recognition by Her Majesty's Government of Persian claims to that island. But it appears, however, in fact to have been no more than a courteous indication by His Majesty's Government of their desire to pay the fullest possible attention to any Persian claims. It will be observed that the first (and apparently the only) communication made to the Persian Government in discharge of this under standing, intimated to that Government the intention of Her Majesty's Govern ment to proceed at once against the ' Chief now in possession of Bahrein '' consequent on his breach of the maritime peace and his attack on the Sheikh who had been placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government. 85—177 ' f 236 Aitch., XIII, No. v, 53.

(9) Closeness of Relations at the 'present Day between Persia and Bahrein The Sheikhs of Bahrein are strongly opposed to any recognition of Persian suzerainty [cp. paragraph 139). The Persian suggestion that relations are at the present time closer between Persia and Bahrein than between Bahrein and any other independent civilised State is without foundation. Relations are at least equally close with k&gt;audi Arabia, and the closest relations are maintained in addition with Great Britain and with British India. The Terms of the Treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 between the British Government and Persia 149. In addition to the nine arguments examined above, Persia has on more than one occasion appealed to the provisions of her treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 with the British Government in connection with her claim to Bahrein. Her appeal is based substantially on the fact that those treaties provide in certain circumstances for the evacuation of Persian territory occupied by British troops. The relevant passages of the treaties are as follows :— (i) By the preliminary 1 reaty of 1809 between His Majesty's Government and Persia, the Persian Government undertook not to ' permit any European force whatever to pass through Persia either towards India or towards the ports of that country ,, ; while His Majesty's Government undertook 'in case any European forces have invaded or shall invade the territories of His Majesty the King of Persia to ' afford to His Majesty the King of Persia a force, or in lieu of it a subsidy, with warlike ammunition , . . and officers. ...' Article 5 of the same treaty provided : ' If a detachment of British troops has arrived from India in the Gulf of Persia and, by the consent of His Persian Majesty, landed on the island of Karak or any of the Persian ports, they shall not in any manner possess themselves of such places, and from the date of these preliminary articles the said detachment shall be at the disposal of His Majesty the King of Persia, the amount of which shall be settled in the definitive treaty.' Article 6 provided that ' If the said troops remain by the desire of His Majesty the King of Persia either at Karak or at any other port in the Gulf of Persia ' they shall be treated in a friendly manner by the Governor and ai rangements made for the supply to them of provisions, &amp;c., at fair prices. (ii) 1 reaty of 1814.—Article (2) provides that 'His Britannic Majesty further engages not to interfere in any dispute which mav hereafter arise between the Princes, noblemen and great chiefs of Persia, and if one of the contending parties should even offer a Province of Persia with a view to obtaining assistance the English Government shall not agree to such proposal, nor by adopting it possess themselves of such part of Persia.' Article 11 piovided that Should His Persian Majesty require assistance from the English Government in the Persian Gulf, they shall, if convenient and practicable, assist him with ships of war and troops. The expenses of such expedition shall be accounted for and defrayed by the Persian Government, and the above ships shall anchor in such ports as shall be pointed out by the Persian Government and not at other harbours without permission, except from absolute necessity.'' (iii) The Treaty of Peace of ±th March, 1857, drawn up on the conclusion ot the war between Persia and Great Britain, provided that ' Peace beim&gt;- happih concluded between rheir said Ala^esties, it is hereby agreed that the forces of H.M. the Queen shall evacuate Persian territory, subject to the con ditions and stipulations hereafter specified' (Art. 2), and that 'immediately on the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty the British troops will desist frorn all acts of hostility against Persia, and the British Government enlaces further that as soon as the stipulations in regard to evacuation by the Persfan troops of the Herat and Afghan territories as well as in regard to the reception of the British Mission at Tehran shall have been carried into full effect, the British troops shall without delay be withdrawn from all parts, places and islands belonging to Persia . . . .' If Bahrein were Persian territory and if it had been occupied by British forces at the times envisaged by the treaty provisions to which appeal is made by Persia, there might be some force in the Persian argument though even then His Majesty's Government might claim that the fact that their actual relations with Bahrein had in no way been affected by the provisions of those treaties, and that Persia had made no protest at the time against any failure to implement those provisions clearly showed that Persia had accepted in the past the fact that Bahrein fell outside her territorial limits. In fact neitherV s 37 in 1809, 1814 nor in 1857 was there any British occupation of Bahrein; while His Majesty's Government, never having admitted Persian sovereignty over Bahrein or regarded Bahrein as an integral part of Persia, have in the past adopted the attitude that the terms of the treaties referred to above are irrelevant for the present purpose. As stated by His Majesty's Government in 1906 in reply to a Persian Note which based the Persian claim upon the provisions of those treaties, ' the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty's Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty's Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein. Such a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible.' Review of the Persian Claim 150. It is revelant in the first place that from 1847 to 1913 the Turkish claim to Bahrein was pressed with at least equal vigour to the Persian claim, and that through much of that period the Turkish claim had a stronger practical justification than can be claimed by Persia since a period long prior to 1783, in that Turkey was the suzerain of the adjoining continental littoral of Arabia and held or preferred claims to both sides of the Gulf by which Bahrein is enfolded. Moreover, Muscat, which in the early part of the i9th centurv on more than one occasion established a temporary control over Bahrein and drew tribute from it, was deterred from urging its claims by force from 1829 onwards onlv yL attitude of His Majesty s Government, while the Wahabi Amirs brought effective pressure to bear on Bahrein and drew tribute from it, though latterly probably in respect only of Bahreini possessions on the mainland, at frequent intervals through the early part of the 19th centucy, and desisted only with their subjugation by Turkey in 1870. Persia, in other words, was up to 1913 one only of the claimants to Bahrein, and through much of the period 1847 to 1913 if anything a less insistent and to some extent a less plausible claimant than Turkey. 151 these considerations, however, apart, the general effect of a review ot the history of Bahrein over the last 150 years and of an examination of the specmc arguments put forward by Persia and referred to in paragraphs 14&amp;-9 above is to suggest that there is no solid basis for a Persian claim to suzeraintv or sovereignty over the islands. The geographical remoteness of the islands from eisia and the fact that their population is Arab are admittedly not decisive arguments. The real weakness in the Persian claim appears to be that there has been no effective exercise of Persian authority in the islands since the expulsion of I ersia by the ancestors of the present ruling house in 1783 Such incidents as the momentary hoisting of the Persian flag in 1860, its flying side y side with the Turkish flag in 1860—61, or the temporary tender of allegiance to I'-I'sia in 1799. 1816-17 and 1839 must be considered in relation to the history ot the islands as a whole, m the period now under consideration, and in particular to the consistent claim of Turkey between 1847 and 1913 and to the absence of any sequel to such momentary acknowledgment of or appeals to Persian power- and they cannot carry the weight of a long dealing extending over a course of years. The remarks of the Government of India in 1870, quoted in paragraph 97 above, are relevant m this connection, as are the observations in paragraph 8 of the British Note to Persia of 18th February, 1929. 0 It may be added, too, that during the period from 1783 Bahrein has at various dates been m a position to enter into treatv engagements or discussions with neighbouring States such as Muscat (paragraph 26) Turkev (paraoraDh 10s\ the Egyptian Viceroy, Mehemet All (paragraph 34) aid ment on a basis inconsistent with her being at the time subject to Persian iuris- diction. A further point of some importance is the absence, so far as available recoi d« show, of any reference to Persia by the Sheikhs of Bahrein at anv date smce the conquest of Bahrein by the ancestors of the present rulers in' 1783 on le occasion of then- accession, or of any formal acknowledgment by Bahrein on such oecas^ns of sovereignty or suzerainty such as might'be expected from a ^hdkh who regarded himself as a vassal of Persia. Nor does any protest been'madnrPersk 7 ' acknowledgment appear at any time to have correspondence of 1869-70, to which particular attention has been Pif I t ? ^. ei ® ia . m t ^ e past, and which may be thought the strono-est contpntirm that Persia is in a position to put forward mav indeed hp contei ] 1 tion of the view taken b/ Her Marty's GoveriW at't^ pS of^heTJkdo' % t ^ ^38 of Persia to Bahrein. But it cannot be valid as against the Sheikhs, and while it is sufficiently loosely expressed to afford some justification for the construc tion which has been placed on it by Persia, it is relevant that the construction placed on it by Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, and supported by the Government of India, passed without challenge in 1871 (paragraph 102); that a similar interpretation was placed on it, with a minimum of preliminary discussion, in 1886 (paragraph 110); that at frequent intervals between 1870 and 1880 His Majesty's Government maintained the independence of Bahrein against Turkey (paragraphs 99-107 above); that so early as January 1870 they drew the attention of the Turkish Government to the British Note of 1851 (paragraph 61 above); and that His Majesty's Government have uninterruptedly maintained the independence of Bahrein against Persia and Turkey alike since the date of the correspondence in question. 153. The Sheikhs themselves appear, particularly in the early part of the past century, before their relations with Her Majesty's Government were placed on a more definite footing by the Agreements of 1880 and 1892, to have been guided by a consideration of their own immediate interests in deciding on the line of policy to be adopted towards the stronger rulers by whom they were * surrounded. It is now more than three-quarters of a century since any appeal, however, flimsy, appears to have been made to Persia by Bahrein. The present Sheikh, Salman, who succeeded his father in 1942, referred in a speech shortly after his accession to 'this country of ours, Bahrein, .... fortunately an e .3538/1227/ independent State', and asserted that he would 'firmly adhere to the ancient 91 and proven friendship with the British Government.' His father and grand father were both keenly apprehensive of any recognition of the Persian claim, and there is no reason to suppose that he is any less strongly opposed to it. C.—Attitude of British Government, 1820-1934 154. From 1820 onwards His Majesty's Government consistently dealt with the Sheikhs as independent rulers. They concluded treaties with them on that basis in 1820, 1847, 1861, 1868 1880 and 1892, and they have been prepared to maintain their independence by diplomatic, or on occasion by forcible methods against challenge from outside, whether from Persia, Turkey, Egypt or the Wahabis. They originally entered into relations with the Sheikhs and promised them a measure of protection (paragraph 16) in the interests of securing the peace of the Persian Gulf. In the early stages of those relations they appear to have been solely concerned to achieve this object (in 1820 they even offered their mediation, which was, however, not accepted by Persia, to secure the payment of tribute to Persia by the Sheikhs), and they restricted their interference with the internal affairs of the Sheikhdom to the minimum required to secure the interests of British subjects. They were consistently reluctant to establish a protectorate over Bahrein in view of the probable local embarrassments in regulating the succes sion, &amp;c., in which this might involve them, and in 1849 they formally declined a request by the Sheikh that he and the islands should be taken under British protection. In 1861 (paragraph 70) they gave the Sheikhs more categorical guarantees of protection in return for more binding undertakings. Their correspondence with the Persian Minister in London in 1869-70 shows the Home Government, however, still ready at that date to adopt the attitude that if any ''V» ^ other Power would discharge the objects which had led Great Britain to under take certain responsibilities in relation to Bahrein, she would gladly see them do so. Closer relations with the Sheikh and closer control over his freedom of action were established for the first time by the Exclusive Agreement of 1880. Relations became closer still with the conclusion of the Exclusive Agreement cf 1892. XY.—Reference to Law Officers of the Crown 155. This was the position in 1934 when it appeared possible that the Persian Government would bring the question formally before the League of Nations at its September session, and some discussion took place between the Foreign Office and the India Office as to the attitude which His Majesty's Government should adopt in the event of the matter being raised under Article 11 or Article 15 of the Covenant. As part of this examination, and in connection with the abortive treaty negotiations of 1934, the Law Officers of the Crown were asked to advise whether in their opinion Persia possessed any rights in or over Bahrein, and, if so, what the nature of those rights was. In their report the Law39 Officers gave as their opinion that Persia had no rights either of sovereignty or suzerainty in or over Bahrein (the full texts of the submission and the report are e. 5011/2369/ included as Appendix II). 91 ' 1934 ' 156. In the event no action was taken by the Persian Government to bring the issue before either the Council or the Assembly. m XYI.—Independent Status of Bahrein 157. Since that date further consideration has been given to the terminology defining the status of Bahrein, and the following considerations are placed on record : In public pronouncements referring to the status of Bahrein the formula used has been; 'an independent Sheikhdom in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government,' although the Persian Government (and, on occasion, the Turkish Government) have been informed that the islands are under British protection. In fact, even before the Exclusive Agreements of 1880 and 1892, the position of Bahrein was tending increasingly to approximate to that of a State under British protection. Those agreements, therefore gave formal recognition to a relationship between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government which was already well-established on the basis of the Treaties of 1820 and 1847 and the Friendly Convention of 1861, in which the Sheikh was described as the ' independent ruler of Bahrein.' On many occasions His Majesty's Government had expressed unwillingness to assume greater responsibility in relation to the islands (paragraph 56 above) (so long as their independence and the performance of the engagements undertaken by the Sheikh could be secured without their doing so), but it was necessary, nevertheless, to intervene on several occasions for the restoration of order or to enforce the implementation of his obligations by the ruling Sheikh. There is no incompatibility between such interventions and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein, which was laid down in 1854 (paragraph 64 above), and, except in so far as intervention has been necessitated by a situation endangering the peace of the Gulf or the status of Bahrein, this principle has been adhered to ever since. Thus, there is no doubt that the internal, or domestic, status of the Sheikh is that of an independent ruler, exactly comparable with that of the rulers of one of the Malay States, of Zanzibar, and of many other territories, and that, from the point of view of English Constitutional Law, not only is the Sheikh an independent sovereign, but his territory is foreign territory and his nationals are aliens. On the other hand, from the point of view of international law, the Sheikh has no independence at all, since by the Exclusive Agreements, he binds himself to abstain from entering into any agreement or correspondence with any other Power than Great Britain, and His Majesty's Government thus excercise control over his foreign relations and jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein. Internation- ally, therefore, the Sheikh has no status and his territory is, from that point of view, under the sovereignty of His Majesty, who governs' it through a ruler who is independent only in the internal or municipal sense, and the parallel in the international sense also between Bahrein and the Malay States and other protected states is exact; the islands are not foreign but British territory, and the nationals of their ruler are British-protected persons and, therefore, nationals of His Majesty as much as British subjects are. This position' has been maintained m many ways; in the defence of Bahreinis against oppression bv the Persian Government, and, most notably, bv the grant to the islands of Imperial e. 6055/2463/ Preference by regarding them as one of the ' territories under His Majestv's e 3913/2463/ protection under Section 21 of the Import Duties Act, 1932. ' 91, 1936. The position in international law created by such treaties with native rulers as the Exclusive Agreements with the Sheikh of Bahrein, is fully discussed by the Arbitrator in his Award in the case between the Tnited States of America and the Netherlands Government relating to the island of Palmas (or Miangas) (Permanent Court of International Arbitration, 4th April, 1928). The Arbitra tor decided in favour of the Netherlands Government, who based their claim on the fact that they had been exercising effective sovereignty for a number of years, and he recognised that the actual exercise of sovereignty creates prescriptive rights which override a previous title. The Netherlands exercised sovereignty bv virtue of treaties with the native ruler under the terms of which he retained his independence with regard to the administration of all internal affairs and delegated control of his foreign relations to the Netherlands Government 'E. 2181/76/34, 1935.

Early in 1934 His Majesty's Government had bought sufficient land at Bahrein to provide for a combined naval and air base to take the place of the naval establishments at Hen jam and Basidu, which it had been decided to relinquish. On 2nd April, 1935, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran handed a note to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs announcing this decision and the fact that the naval stations were being moved to Bahrein. In his reply M. Kazemi referred to '' the right of the Imperial Government in connection with Bahrein, both for the present and for the future,' but qualified his reservation by stating that he did not wish at that juncture to embark on a discussion of the question. At the same time M. Kazemi indicated that his Government might recognise the 'independence'' of Bahrein in return for assistance and concessions by His Majesty's Government in other matters. He also said that Bahrein was of no interest to Persia, though, on account of public opinion on the subject, the Persian Government could not abandon their claim without some return. 159. On 3rd April, 1935, the Persian Minister in London wrote a letter to The Times commenting on a leading article on naval changes in the Persian Gulf, in which he stated that the Persian Government had never recognised a British protectorate over Bahrein, over which Persia had never relinquished sovereignty. In reply to a subsequent question in Parliament Sir John Simon stated that His Majesty's Government, who had been in close treaty relations with the rulers of Bahrein since 1820, did not regard, and had never regarded, the Persian claim as possessing any validity whatever. Persian Government's refusal to recognise visas and endorsements for Bahrein 160. In 1933 the Persian Government began to refuse to visa passports which were endorsed for Bahrein and Kuwait, and a form of retaliatory action was taken by His Majesty's Government in consequence, although this was soon dropped owing to the complications which it involved, and specific endorsements for Arab States in the Persian Gulf on British passports were abolished. In May 1934 His Majesty's Ambassador at Tehran made representations on the matter to the Persian Government, but Mirza Baghir Kazemi alleged that the endorsement 'Bahrein'' on British passports was something new which was naturally not recognised by the Persian Government. Persia visa regulations issued in March 1934 contained (Chapter VI—Prohibitions) an instruction to refuse a visa for entry to Persia on passports ' endorsed as valid for the journey to Bahrein or which bear a visa for Bahrein.' No satisfaction was received as a result of the representations made to the Persian Government, and the difficulty was overcome by the issue for journeys to Bahrein of a temporary passport without the endorsement or visa for Bahrein. Owing to the possibility of a harmful effect upon prospective treaty negotia tions of continuing the argument on this subject, m 1934 it was allowed to lapse, and the practical success of the device of the temporary passport has precluded the necessity of raising the question since that date. Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Arabian Government regarding Transit Dues at Bahrein 161. In a note dated 30th May, 1936, the Minister for Foreign Affairs protested against the agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Arabian Government regarding Bahrein Transit Dues, which had been concluded in November 1935 and published in this country in May 1936. The Note stated that the Persian Government regarded the action of His Majesty's Government as a denial of Persia's indisputable rights, and stated that he must make all possible reserves in respect of present and future rights and interests of the Persian Government. A copy of this Note was sent by the Persian Government to the Secretariat of the League of Nations and to the Government of Saudi Arabia. A Note was addressed to the Persian Government in reply on the 1st October, reminding them of the views previously expressed by His Majesty's Government in the matter, and a copy of this Note was sent to the League of Nations for circulation to members. This called forth a rejoinder from the Persian Government, dated 6th May, 1937, which referred to the ' indisputable rights ' of the Persian Government, and stated that the arguments of His Majesty's Government were not regarded as convincing, and could not shake the41 arqii legitimate rights of Persia; a copy of this communication was not apparently sent to the League of Nations, and no action was taken by His Majesty's Government on it. The Liabilities of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf 162, On 3rd February, 1937, the Under-Secretary of State for India was asked a question in the House of Commons relating to the liabilities of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf. In reply he said that ' the Arab States of Kuwait, Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Coast are in treaty relations with His Majesty's Government under which they enjoy in varying degrees His Majesty's protection,' The Persian Ambassador made a protest at this state ment, which he described as ' inconsistent with the sovereignty of his Government over the Bahrein islands/' The standard reply was given, which was acknowledged in a Note which referred again to the indisputable rights of sovereignty of the Persian Government over the Bahrein islands already set forth in the letter of 2nd August, 1928, (paragraph 140 above). No reply was sent to this further protest. Treatment of Bahreinis in Persia 163, In 1934 considerable trouble was caused by the oppression of Bahreinis by the Persian authorities in Khuzistan, Many of them had not taken out Persian registration papers and found themselves involved in difficulties with the police and the registration authorities, who behaved in an exceedingly high handed manner, beating and ill-treating the men concerned. Some of the victims had been born in Persia, and thus had dual nationality ; some, though born in Bahrein, owned land in Persia, Even those born outside Persia who owned no Confidential land would not affect their status as Bahreinis by accepting Persian registration papers if they subsequently chose to leave Persia, All were accordingly advised to register and the trouble died down. On 16th November, 1937, His Majesty's Minister addressed a Note to the e. 7157/1359/ Persian Government protesting against the action of the Persian authorities at 91 ' 1937 Khorramshahr in confiscating the Bahrein registration papers of a Bahreini dhow and obliging the nakhuda to take out Persian papers before allowing him to leave the port. To this Note the Persian Government replied on 12th Confidential December restating the view that Bahrein was Persian territory, and adding that they regarded the protest as unjustifiable. Bahrein Nationality and Property Laws 164, In February 1937 the Bahrein Government enacted a Nationality Law and a law regarding the ownership of immovable property in Bahrein by foreigners. The main object of these laws was to retaliate for the treatment of Bahreinis in Persia. The Persian Government addressed a Note of protest to His Majesty's Minister in Tehran on 13th June, stating that these laws were contrary to the sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, and that they could not in any e. 3757/781/ way impair the rights of the Persian Government. As on the occasion of the 5)1 Persian protest of 1936 regarding the levy of transit dues at Bahrein (see para graph 161), a brief reply was sent on 9th September stating that the views of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom on the subject had been set out on many occasions, and notably in the Note of 18th February, 1929. The intended notification applying the Bahrein Property Law to Persian subjects in Bahrein was published on 1st November. In a Xote dated 28th December, e. 7379/781/ 1938, the Persian Government duly protested against the notification, stating 91 ' 1937 that it was now clear that the sole object of the Property Law was to impose restrictions on the ownership of property by non-Bahreini Persians who had settled in the island. A copy of this Note, which again referred to Persia's legitimate rights and denied the independence of the islands and the existence of any special British rights therein, was sent to the League of Nations. In this case it was decided not to pursue the matter with the Persian Government, and His Majesty's Government contented themselves with addressing a letter to the League of Nations on 12th March, 1938, stating that they had nothing to add to their Note to the Persian Government of 9th September, 1937. e. 428/14/91, 1938. e. 1213/14/91, 1938. Treatment of Persians in Bahrein 165. In June 1938 vigorous oral representations were made by the Persian Government about the treatment of Persian subjects in Bahrein, who, they alleged, were being expelled or imprisoned in connection with the Nationality 85—17742 and Property Laws. It transpired that the action taken had nothing to do with these laws, but had been taken undter a King's Regulation of 1937 which provided for the expulsion of all foreigners entering Bahrein without valid travel documents. It was explained that the application of this Regulation had, in practice, been restricted to indigents, with whom Bahrein had been flooded. The Persian Government let the matter drop and the question was not given any publicity in the vernacular press. An interesting feature Confidential, upon which His Majesty's Minister remarks in his Annual Report, was that it pal-as 26-28. marked a change in the attitude hitherto adopted by the Persian Government towards Bahrein. Though they were careful to maintain orally Persia's claim to sovereignty, and though their approach only amounted to enlisting the good offices of His Majesty's Government, the fact that diplomatic action was taken amounted in practice to de facto admission of His Majesty's Government's position in Bahrein.

The last occasion which can be traced on which correspondence passed between His Majesty's Government and the Persian Government on the question of sovereignty over Bahrein was in connection with difficulties which had arisen regarding postal services between Persia and Bahrein. It is unnecessary here to enter into the details of a somewhat involved correspondence between 1939 and 1943, it being sufficient to record that, in Notes of 29th June, 1942, and 24th December, 1942, His Majesty's Legation at Tehran and the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs respectively reserved the claims of their Governments regarding the ownership of the islands. Persian Government decree regarding import of Petroleum Products from Bahrein 167. Prominence was given by the Persian press in April 1946 to a decree of the Council of Ministers laying down that all petroleum products imported from Bahrein should be subject to the same dues and royalties as those levied on Anglo-Iranian Oil Company products. Satisfaction was expressed with this action ' since the Persian (government and nation considered Bahrein an integral part of Persian territory.' The quantity imported from Bahrein during the previous twelve months was extremely small, and this and other signs made a renewal of the claim to the islands appear to be imminent. Up to the end of 1946, however, the subject was not re-opened by the Persian Government. Remarks of the Persian Prime Minister to the United States Ambassador 168. On 31st August, 1946, the United States Ambassador at Tehran paid a few hours' visit to Bahrein, and while there told the Political Resident that the Persian Prime Minister, Qawam as Sultaneh, had shown him the original of the letter of 1869 (paragraph 84 above) from Her Majesty's Government, upon which, he said, Persia mainly based her claim to the islands. He had added that at present he did not propose to pursue the claim with the United Nations or the International Court of Justice, as he thought it was unlikely to succeed owing to the strength of British influence in those bodies. Recent references to Bahrein in the Persian Press 169. The subject of Bahrein came up, after a long silence, early in 1945 when articles appeared in the Tudeh papers {Darya of 7th January, and Nida-yi-Haqiqat of 11th January) which maintained that the islands belong to Persia, and that His Majesty's Government had, by implication, accepted Persian sovereignty over them in 1935. The evacuation of Bahrein was expected to take place at the same time as that of the rest of Persia. The second article charged His Majesty's Government with violation of Persian rights over the islands, and claimed that the Sheikh's agreement with the Standard Oil Com pany was illegal. The following month a poem was published in a Shiraz Tudeh paper on the same subject. 170. On 21st September, 1945, a leading article in Nauruz-i-Iran referring to a statement on the evacuation of Russian troops made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Majlis, called upon the United States of America to exacuate Bahrein and postpone the exploitation of the oilfields. Persia's right of ownership in Bahrein was said to be proved by records in the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.43 171. In February, March and May 1946 further press references occurred in the same vein. On 27th and 28th August the Ahcun (Tudeh) asked that p,n.s.9i /4 g. the question should be referred to the Peace (conference, and three other papers |; referred briefly to the claim on the following day. p.N.s. 342/46 172. On '12th December, 1946, the Tehran Radio reported a speech by a (Supplement), member of the crowd of Democrats in Tehran congratulating the Prime Minister on the Azerbaijan settlement. In it the Persian army was praised for its heroism and for hoisting the Lion and Sun ' over the whole of this ancient State from Serakhs to Khanaqin, and from Aras to Bahrein/ 1 r _ i 173. Several Tehran papers have also recently taken up the cause of Bahrein. Mashrutiyat (Centre), in a series of articles written in December, states ; ' 1 here is no difference between Azerbaijan and Bahrein from Persia's point of view .... We favour the integrity of the entire country .... Foreign penetration in any part of the island is intolerable to us ... . The Government should insist on the establishment of its power in Bahrein, just as it did in Azerbaijan.' 174. Although history shows that it is not necessary to see the Soviet hand behind these claims, it must be recorded that they appeared in newspapers known to be sponsored by the Soviet, and that they are constantly echoed in the Soviet broadcasts as evidence of the ' imperialism ' of His Majesty's Government.

Khan Mossaed to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—{Received November 28.) Persian Legation, London, Your Excellency, November 26, 1927. I HAVE the honour to state that the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs has recently addressed a note to His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, of which the following is a translation :— '1. According to information received by the Persian Government, a treaty was concluded between His Britannic Majesty and Ibn Saud and signed at Jeddah on the 20th May last, of which article 6 is as follows ;— ''His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Kuwait and Bahrain, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Government/ ' 2. The sovereignty of Persia over the Island of Bahrain being well founded, the Imperial Persian Government, at the time a special treaty was concluded between the British Government and the Sheikh of Bahrain, right fully protested, and Lord Clarendon, in a letter dated the 29th April, 1869, addressed to the then Persian Minister in London, formally acknowledged the justice of that protest. ' 3. You will realise that the insertion of article 6 in the above- mentioned treaty, in so far as it relates to Bahrain, is averse to the territorial integrity of Persia, and, consequently, incompatible with the friendly relations subsisting between two neighbouring countries. '4. I therefore earnestly protest against the insertion of the above article in the treaty, and shall look forward to suitable measures being taken, as soon as practicable, by His Britannic Majesty's Government, with a view to its elimination. ' 5. I have to add further that, Persia being a member of the League of Nations, the Imperial Persian Government, conformably to article 10 of the Covenant, which guarantees the territorial integrity of its members, have forwarded a copy of their note to the League of Nations, with the request that their protest may receive due consideration.' 85—177 o 2I beg leave to bring this matter to the notice of your Excellency for your kind consideration. I have, &amp;c. HOVHANNES KHAN MOSSAED, Persian Minister. [E 220/51/91] (B) Sir Austen C 1 hamherlain to Hovhannes Khan Mossaed ^ 11, Foreign Office, January 18, 1928. v e ^ OI . 10U1, acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 2otn November, containing the formal protest which the Persian Government have seen ht to make against the terms of article '6 of the Treaty of Jeddah, concluded on the 20th May, 1927, between His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King oi the Hejaz and Nejd and its dependencies, on the ground that the reference in that article to the Islands of Bahrein is contrary to the territorial integritv of Persia. .^ n i ; e P I }s I shall be grateful if you will inform your Government that His Majesty s Government are not aware of any valid grounds upon which the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over these islands is or can be based. Geographically, the islands are not a part of Persia, nor are the inhabitants of^l ersian race. His Majesty's Government are aware that during part oi the 17th century and for some years during the latter part of the 18th # century Bahrein was overrun and occupied by Persian troops, or by the followers of certain chiefs from the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf ; but it appears to be established that in or about the year 1783 the Government of the ohdh were dispossessed of the islands by an invasion of Arab tribes under the leadership of the direct lineal ancestor of the present Sheikh, and that since that date the islands have never at any time been under the effective control of Persia. 3. The Persian Government have on various occasions alleged that their claim to sovereignty over Bahrein has been recognised by His Majesty's Govern ment. VV hile it is not evident that, even if this assertion were justified it would confer on Persia the right of ownership which on other grounds appears so difficult to establish, His Majesty's Government feel that they must once and for all declare this statement to be entirely inadmissible. ^ . r ^ e special treaty relations between His Majesty's Government and the successive bheikhs of Bahrein, to which reference is made in the Treaty of Jeddah have now been in existence for more than a century, the first in the series of under- takmgs by which those relations are regulated having been signed in the year cS - iu a o re ? ments have throughout been concluded on the basis that' the feneikn ot Bahrein is an independent ruler. His Majesty's Government do not deny that the claim to independence of the Sherkh is one which has from time to time been contested by the Government of the Shah, and in particular in the discussions which took place in 1869, to which reference is made in your note. desne, however, to point out that your Government are under a complete misunderstanding in inferring from the terms of the communication made by the late Larl of Clarendon to the Persian Minister on the 29th April 1869 that any recognition of the validity of the Persian claims to sovereignty in Bahrein was at that time intended. In that note it was stated that Her Majesty's Government u c ' ue . cons i^ ei ' a tion to the protest of the Persian Government 'against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British authorities, hut it in no way admitted any such right. On the contrary the whole tenor of the note should have made it clear that Her Majesty's Government maintained their right to enter into direct treaty relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers; and while at the same time it indicated that He^ Majesty s Government would gladly transfer to Persia, if she were able and willing to perform them, certain duties in the Persian Gulf towards the pertormance of which the treaty relations in question contributed and offered m view of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty's Government toward^ Persia, to cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand when practicable, of any measure of coercion which the conduct of the Sheikhs mio-M have rendered necessary, it is evident that no recognition of the validity of the Persian protest, or of the Persian claim to suzerainty, was thereby intended or implied. The note, in fact, as the Persian Legation at Constantinople was45 ♦ • » reminded in December 1871 by Sir Henry Elliott, then Her Majesty's Ambassador in 1 urkey, contains nothing more than an acknowledgment that the Persian claim to suzerainty had previously been made. The numerous supplementary agree ments entered into between the British Government and the rulers of Bahrein between 186J and the present day have equally proceeded on the assumption that a claim to sovereignty in Bahrein on the part either of the Government of the fehah or ot the lurkish Government could not possibly be admitted by His Majesty s Government. J 5. The attitude of His Majesty's Government towards this question was still more clearly defined when m the year 1906 His Majesty's Minister at Tehran on my predecessors instructions, addressed to the Persian Government a note stating . 1118 Majesty s Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, and such a claim is, in their view, entirely inadmissible. His Majesty s Government consider the Island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and must decline to entertain any xurther representations on the subject.' The note added that this reply had invariably been made to the Ottoman Government, which had on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrein. In reply to this note, a formal protest was received from the Persian Government, in which their claim to sovereignty over Bahrein was based on an agreement, dated the 30th August, 1822, between ?^ in ™ ?? UCe ' special commissioner of the British Government' and the I mice Governor of Shiraz. This agreement, however, as was pointed out m a reply from His Majesty s Minister on the 2nd January, 1907, and again on the 23rd February, 1907, was promptly disavowed at the time by the proper repiesentatives of His Britannic Majesty, as having been entered into without aut lonty, and His Majesty lath Ali Shah also refused to recognise its stipulations, and expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions. In these circumstances, having regard to international law and force m ' a &amp; reem ent cannot be regarded as ever having possessed any binding 6. From the foregoing remarks you will observe that the Persian Govern ment are not justified in supposing that His Majesty's Government either in 1869 ^ a . an i?i tl 1 me ' in . te ; ide 1 d t0 recognise that Bahrein was a part of Persia and that, while they have, indeed admitted that a claim on the subject has from'time lal Tf ^ P forward by the Persian Government, they have never admitted the validity of the claims which either the Turkish or Persian Governments have trequently put forward in the past. Their consistent endeavour in the matter of Bahrein has been to secure that the peaceful development of the islands and the welfare of the Arab inhabitants shall not be disturbed by unjustified attempts on the pait of their neighbours to subject them to a foreign domination. They are not piepared to contemplate any departure from this policy. I have, &amp;c. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN. [E 4249/51/91] (C) .1//. Pon to Sir Austeu hoTiihwloiii.—{Received August 27.) (No. 363.)

Veuillez, &amp;c. F. PAKREVAN. [E 853/33/91] (D) Sir Austen Chamberlain to Hovhannes Khan Mossaed Sir, Foreign Offuce, February 18, 1929. IN a note dated the 18th January, 1928, I had the honour to inform you, in reply to your note of the 26th November, 1927, respecting the claim advanced by your Government to the islands of Bahrein, that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom were not aware of any valid grounds upon which the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over those islands was or could be based. Some months later, on the 2nd August, 1928, the Persian Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran a further note explaining in detail tJhe reasons which have led his Government to consider themselves justified in advancing such a claim. I now have the honour to request that you will convey to your Government the following reply :— 1 2. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have examined with the greatest care the views set forth in the Persian Government's note of the 2nd August, and have endeavoured to extract from the many unsupported declarations that Bahrein forms an integral part of Persia (a statement which, as I have already indicated in my note under reference, bears no relation to geographical facts), the essential arguments on which this claim is based. They note that the Persian Government do not in any way base their claim on the alleged recognition of their rights in the past by His Majesty's Government. So far as can be deduced from their note under reply, their claim is, in fact, founded on three main arguments; Firstly, on uninterrupted possession except for the period of Portuguese occupation between 1507 and 1622; secondly, on a^n alleged principle of international law that a territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory; and, thirdly, on documents of a date later than the end of the 18th century, in which the sheikhs of the islands are alleged to have declared their submission to the Persian Government, and on the alleged payment by them of tribute to the Persian Government. After full examination of these arguments His Majesty's Government have reached the conclusion, for the reasons given below, that they entirely fail to substantiate a Persian claim to sovereignty over the islands at the present day. , . , i j 3. In the first place, the statement that 4 ' Bahrein has always and uninterruptedly formed part of Persia in past centuries, except dining the Portuguese occupation from 150/ to 1622 is not one which can be allowed to pass unquestioned. I have already drawn attention to the evident fact that geographically this assertion is misleading. Historically it is almost equally misleading. The earlier history of the islands before 1507 is obscure, but it cannot seriously be maintained that they were subject to Persian sovereignty all through the Arab, Mongol and Tartar invasions and the anarchy of the Middle Ages. On the contrary, modern historians have expressed the opinion that from the 11th to the beginning of the 16th century the inhabitants of Bahrein were subject to chiefs 85—177 Hoi their own race; and, among contemporary writers, the Arabian geographer, ldr is i, writing in the latter hall of the 12th century, stated categorically that the island w as then governed by an independent chief. It is, therefore, impossible to accept the view that the island was continuously subject to Persia before 1507. Between the years 1507 and 1622 the islands were occupied by the Portuguese, as the Persian Government themselves admit. The period of Persian rule began in 1622 and ended in 17H3, when the Persian troops were finally driven out of the islands by the ancestors of the present Sheikh of Bahrein, but it is not to be supposed that even during this period of Persian ascendancy, Persian rule was continuous and unchallenged, or that it brought peace and prosperity to the inhabitants. The Persian occupation after the expulsion of the Portuguese was of uncertain duration, but it seems to be established that about the year 1718 a descent was made upon the island by the Omani Arabs, who then occupied it for a short period. In the middle of the 18th century control appears to have passed into the hands of the once powerful Huwala Arabs, who even at the present day are strongly represented there, though in 1753 Persia was again able to assert her ascendancy by conquest. In 1783, however, the troops of His Majesty the Shah were finally driven out by the Utubi Arabs, and the authority of Persia ceased, never to be re-established. 4. It will be evident from the brief historical summary contained in the preceding paragraph that such historical evidence as can be adduced in favour of the Persian claim must rest mainly upon intermittent occupation between the years 1622 and 1783, a period which comprises at least two periods of Arab rule. On the other hand, a period of approximately equal length between 1783 and the present day has elapsed during which no dominion has been exercised in the islands by Persia, and Arab rule has been uninterrupted. In these circumstances His Majesty's Government cannot but regard the claim of Bahrein to independence from Persia as abundantly established. 5. It is in the light of the historical events summarised above that the second argument of the Persian Government must be examined, viz., that part of their note now under reply in which they affirm as an alleged principle of international law the statement that '' a territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue of an official act, in this case a treaty, or so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory.' Even if this statement could be accepted as valid, it would still be necessary for Persia to prove that she is, or ever has been, the lawful owner of Bahrein, and that such rights as she may have acquired in former ages by conquest and the exercise of force outweigh those not only of the Portuguese, but of the Arab inhabitants themselves. 6. His Majesty's Government, however, deny without hesitation that any such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, forms part of inter national law. The assertion that the consent of the dispossessed State is invariably required to validate a change of sovereignty is contradicted both by 1 international practice and the facts of history. Moreover, it would, if it existed, seriously prejudice the maintenance of peace and international order. It would be open to any State to advance a claim to territory, of which it has not for centuries been in effective possession, on the ground that its loss of possession in distant ages had not been confirmed by a subsequent treaty. To assert such a legal principle would be to assert that on a disputed question of territory the one factor that is decisive is the expressed will of one of the disputants. On the contrary, in cases where a territory has effectively established its independence, of the former sovereign, a treaty by which the disposed owner recognises its independence is in effect chiefly valuable as conclusive evidence that, in the view of the former sovereign, such independence has been effectively established. In such cases the effective establishment by the territory of its independence is the deciding factor in the question of international title, and in the ease of Bahrein His Majesty's Government regard as wholly untenable the proposition that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been independent of Persia, and during which no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the Persian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence. 7. It is, moreover, abundantly clear from historical precedents that the theory of the necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State is not one which has ever obtained international acceptance. The revolted Spanish colonies in South America were diplomatically recognised as independent States by the United States Government in 1822 and by the British Governmentm 18^4, many years before their independence was formally admitted by Spain. J he independence ol lexas in 1837 and that of Panama in 1903 were recognised by the United States, and subsequently by Great Britain and other European 1'owers, long before Mexico and Colombia had ceased to look upon those territories as revolted provinces. In these instances, to which others could, if necessary, be added, tne effective establishment of independence was clearly regarded by the Towers as the ruling factor in the situation, and the consent oi the dispossessed State was not held to be a condition sine qua non of a valid transfer or acquisition of territory. In the case of Bahrein, whose sheikhs have now been in treaty relations with His Majesty s Government for more than a century as independent rulers, it was thus not necessary for His Majesty's Government to await the consent of Persia before such recognition could be accorded. 8. Ihe only other argument advanced by the Persian Government in support of their claim is the statement that the sheikhs of Bahrein at some time later than the end of the 18th century declared in writing their entire submission and fidelity to the Persian Government, and that they paid tribute to the Persian Government. Although the Persian Government do not give any details in corroboration of this assertion, and although it would probably be difficult at the present day to prove the authenticity of any documents which may be in their possession. His Majesty's Government are perfectly prepared to admit the possibility that such documents may exist. They do not, however, consider that the existence of such documents, or even evidence, were this forthcoming, of payments by the Rulers of Bahrein to the Government of the Shah can be regarded as establishing the validity of Persia's claim. They have always been well aware tihat the unfortunate rulers of the islands, surrounded by warlike and more powerful States which menaced their independence, professed on various occasions during the first sixty or seventy years of the 19th century an unwilling allegiance to Muscat, to Persia, to Turkey, to the rulers of the mainland of Arabia, even to Egypt—to any Power, in short, who would agree to offer them protection and seemed at the time in a strong enough position to do so; and that at different times for short periods they paid tribute to Muscat, Egypt, or the Wahabi Arabs of the mainland. Any argument based on payment of tribute would, therefore, be available in support of a claim to sovereignty over Bahrein by any of the States to which tribute was, in fact, paid, and, in any case, it is evident that this timid and vacillating policy pursued on occasion by his predecessors cannot be held to affect the position of the present sheikh, who is tirm in his determination to resist the Persian Government's claims, and has empowered His Majesty's Government to refute them on his behalf, in virtue of the treaties which give them the right of defending Bahrein from external aggression. 9. In view of the fact tihat the Persian Government do not base any part of their claim on the alleged recognition of that claim by His Majesty's Government in the past, it seems unnecessary here to reply in detail to the various arguments by which the Persian Government endeavour to show that their claims have received British recognition in the past. I have already, in my note of the 18th January, 1928, explained that it has never on any occasiojn been the intention of His Majesty's Government to admit the validity of Persia's claims, and I must now ask the Persian Government to believe that a further full and careful examination of the contemporary records confirms that statement in its entirety. Ever since the year 1820, when His Majesty's Government first entered into special treaty relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein without any 1 reference to the Government of the Shah, they have acted on the assumption that the sheikh is an independent ruler. In 1822, when Captain William Bruce was recalled for having negotiated the terms of an agreement with the Prince Governor of Shiraz without their authority, the main reason recorded for his recall and for the prompt disavowal of this tentative agreement is that ' it acknowledges the King of Persia's title to Bahrein, of which there is not the least proof.' No clearer statement could possibly have been made of the views held by His Majesty's Government at that date, more than a century ago; they have never since seen any reason to alter their opinion. 10. The Earl of Clarendon's note of the 29th April, 1869, to which the Persian Government devote so large a part of their note now under reply, was certainly never intended to bear tihe interpretation now placed upon it by the Persian Government. As was pointed out in my note of the 18th January, 1928, it admitted that the Persian Government had advanced a claim to Bahrein, it stated that due consideration had been given to their claim, but it did not admit 85—177 h 2that their claim was valid. It even affirms the intention of the British Government to continue to hold the sheikhs to the treaty engagements which had been entered into with them as independent rulers. His Majesty's Government are entirely unable to admit that an implicit acknowledgment of the validity of the Persian claims is constituted by the reference in that note to the considemtions which led to the establishment and the maintenance of those treaty relations; nor can they agree that the dependence or otherwise of Bahrein on Persia can in any way be affected by the fact that in entering upon and maintaining their treaties with the sheikhs they were principally moved by a desire to suppress piracy and the slave trade and to maintain the police of the Gulf, duties which the Persian Government themselves were not in a position effectively to perform. It is true that at that time Her Majesty's Government were mainly influenced by the consideration that they, like Persia, were interested in the safety of the Persian Gulf for commerce, and that they would gladly have accepted Persia's co-operation in maintaining order had her naval position admitted of it; but, although they did not consider Persia's claims to ownership to be valid, they were not at that time directly concerned in refuting them. The special treaties by which they eventually agreed to accept the control of the sheikh's foreign relations were concluded at a later date. 11. I must in this connexion invite the Persian Government to take note of the fact that there is no conceivable ground for the suggestion in the last paragraph of the second section of your Government's note under reply that tihe independent status enjoyed by the rulers of Bahrein can in any sense be represented as the result of 41 rebellion at a foreign State's instigation.' This suggestion is one which His Majesty's Government repudiate as entirely unjustifiable. When in 1820, consequent on their suppression of the piratical activities of the independent rulers of the trucial coast of Oman, they found it necessary to consider tihe position in regard to Bahrein, nearly forty years had elapsed since tihe conquest of this island by the ancestor of the present sheikh, and during those years Persia had exercised no dominion in the islands and appeared to have taken no measures to re-establish her position. They had accordingly no hesitation in entering into negotiations and concluding a treaty with the independent ruler without prior reference to the Government of the Shah. Their object, as stated by Lord Clarendon in 1869, was the suppression of piracy and tihe maintenance of peace in the Gulf; they strictly confined themselves to the measures necessary to attain that object, and while it migjit have been open to them to establish their dominion over the sheikh, they did not choose to do so, but contented themselves with an arrangement to secure the safety of international shipping without imposing on themselves the burden of administration. They maintained this position not only in 1820 but on other occasions in subsequent years, and notably in 1848, when they declined to accede to the sheikh's request that his dominions should be incorporated in those of Her Majesty the Queen. The treaty of 1820, by which the Sheikh of Bahrein bound himself to abstain from plunder and piracy by land and sea, from the slave traffic and from inter-tribal war was followed in 1847, in 1856, and 1861 by further treaties designed to secure the same objects—the suppression of slavery, and tihe general pacification of the Gulf in the interests of international shipping. The British Government concluded all these treaties with the sheikh as an independent ruler, and consistently refused throughout to admit the Turkish, Persian and other claims to sovereignty over his dominions. It was not until the treaty of 1861 that Her Majesty's Government, in return for the sheikh's undertaking to abstain from maritime aggression, war and piracy, assured him in return of their support against similar aggression, nor till a still later period in 1880 and 1892, that they took upon themselves the unqualified liability for the foreign relations of that ruler, under which he has now invoked their assistance in repelling what he not unnaturally regards as a wholly unprovoked attempt on his independence by a foreign Government. 12. In conclusion, His Majesty's Government cannot refrain from expressing their surprise that the Persian Government should have referred in this correspondence to article 10 of the Covenant of tihe League of Nations, under which the members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression, the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the League; and that they should seemingly imagine that the terms of this article lay an obligation on members of the League to support Persian pretensions to an island which is separated from Persia by the whole width of the Persian Gulf, and over which Persia has exercised no authority for 145 years.— Cbj-^L j? t'^y n Telegram From To Repeated No.63 En Clair.

It is clear that draft proposal has taken this form in the hope of forestalling Russian resentment by- maintaining that there is no discrimination against them; and that it is not main purpose of Persian Government to carry out its 'duty' under (c) and (d). 2. On the other hand this latter part of ( omission ) may come to assume major importance and Persian Government, if it accepts obligation of opening negotiations with H.M.G. t/9' Co over ( omission ) -Iranian Oil Company's concession, would then be prevented by public opinion from concluding them except on much more favourable terms than those of present concession. I assume therefore that H .M .G. would have no intention whatever of agreeing to open such negotiations and that they would insist upon validity of 1933 ( omission ) and continuance of concession on its present terms until 1993. 3. You may wish me to make some statement to this effect to Persian Government if this resolution ? is ? passed ? and I would be glad of instructions in due course. Meanwhile it is important that any comment made by the B.B.C. and British Press and by Embassy Information Depart ment here, should be in a uniform line. For the moment • * I imagine that little ( gr. mut. ) ? be said except to repeat the facts of the 1933 renewal of ? Anglo -Iranian Oil Company Concession, of its expiry in 1993 and of absence of any 2--vm - 2 - of any arrangements for an earlier revision. Some similar factual statement about the status of Bahrain might be made also, but It would probably be preferable on the whole to Ignore the Bahrain issue completely.

Why should we not speak our thoughts freely and why should we not seek to recover our lost rights.

I shall do^ everything I can to secure the complete and official restoration to Persia of this indisputable right'. From the speech of December 5rd, 'Concerning Bahrain.

My telegram No. 1255, v'* »' I saw the Prime Minister this evening and received from him an explanation on the following lines, 2. With regard to the Anglo-Persian concession I reminded him of the assurance which he gave me at our last meeting that he would inform me first if at any time or for any reason he wished to suggest a change in the concession (sce'my telegram Mo. 1154 paragraph 2). Prime Minister said that in spite of the [grp. undec. ?untimely] words which he was reported to have used (see my telegram No. 1254) he had no intention whatsoever to suggest anv chance in the concession. In conversation with Mr, Gass a few days ago he had suggested that the company should make some contribution to the welfare of Persia over and above such liabilities as they incurred under the strict terms of the concession. He asked me to^make it Gl^Q^ to you that in making this suggestion he intended that initiative and also any decision which might be taken should be enirely on tne side of the company. 3. With regard to Bahrein no action of any kind had been token beyond the formulation of a request by the .. rm^etent conmittee of the Mai lis for official documentation. If Eis words hod erected a different impression it should be attributed to the political background against «/hioh he had Snken It could not be denied that there was at present real concern in this country about the status of Bahrein, H p aerLed with mc that if this question were now raised it was likely to give much trouble to all concerned, but to hiVregret he felt that there was no alternative. He suzerainty 'over thi's'sheikhdo^or 'ternativefy to Mree to any G specific 1 coiment a but n made S it lJ cloar'that I thought this a mosV unf or tun a t e initiative on his part. /4.-2- ,♦.'0.1 v. ... . 't. t j j - . j 4 % As regards the general situation the Prime Minister said there was a Gomplete deadlock. His Ministers, acting under instructions, had tendered their resignations to the Shah and nDt to him, Hehad refused to follow suit although pressed tp do so,. His reason was thct in the nbscnoe of a vote of confidence in the Mailis it would he unconstitutional for him to resign, he had however'made it clear-thot he would 'be ready to submit to'such, a: vote at any t^me. Leaving all personal feelings out of count it seemed to him exceptionally unfortunate for the country that he should pe attacked simultaneously by enemies at home and abr9aa. Finally he asked whether I would think it appropriate to seek audience with the Shah in the near future, I said that I should be glad to see His Majesty if he sent for me or if I received instructions in that sense but any personal initiative on my part at this juncture was oound to be misconstrued and should therciore oe avoided.

The Minister of Health, eh cm we approached privately, at once agreed to waive the cholera restrictions, but the Ministry of Foreign Affaire asked for a note and sat on it for nearly a fortnight. They finally informed us orally that the visa would be granted, but intimated that it would have been better if our note had not mentioned B ahrein. The Ambassador's despatch No«483 of 2nd December, 1947, reports the latest speech by the Prime Ministsr in ehich qavam undertakes to bring back Bahrein into the bosom of ths Motherland* It ia therefore hardly a coincidence that the Persian authoritiea should bs stioky sbout visas for persons hailing from Bahrein at thie Juncture and, indeed, it seems to us only too probable that they will continue to make difficulties* At the moment the only suggestion we can make is that applicants for Persian visas should, if possible, avoid all mention of Bahrein in their papers* Another point, ehich we put forward with aome diffidence, ia/a recommendation from our Consul ate-General in Basra may conceivebly do applicants more harm than good.

Your telegron No. 948. -xtv ' Qavam is on the point of leaving for Switzerland and the new government may not be formed for some days A Meanwhile I venture to submit the following comment. 2. The present attitude of the Soviet Government towards Qavam makes it difficult to believe that anyone of his intel ligence would seek in this way to curry favour with them. I believe however that his references to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and Bahrein were primarily designed to enlist the support of Persian Left Wing elements by creating the impres sion that his downfall was mainly due to British resentment of his determination to give effect to paragraph E of his Majlis resolution. 5. In view of Qavam's previous assurances to me such a man oeuvre is quite indefensible even if as I believe - and this view generally held and expressed here - it was simply a piece of political window-dressing, and in conversation reported in my telegram No. 1259 I did my best to make this clear. On the other hand the Prime Minister's remarks to Mr. Gass referred to in the above tele grain were made quite casually during a courtesy call and therefore can hardly be considered an official 'approach' of the kind referred to at our previous meeting. Mr. Gass was here to discuss with the Persian Government certain articles of the concession which called for periodical review but, in the statements reported in my tele gram No. 1254, the Prime Minister obviously wished to convey the quite erroneous inipression that the arrival of Mr. Gass followed out of paragraph E of the Majlis resolution. 4. \4. All this is now largely academic but I feel bound to place it on record. What is not academic, it seems to me, is that in spite of the studiously vague terms of paragraph E of the Majlis resolution any Persian Prime Minister may find himself compelled under It to. do what .Qavam vainly pretends to have done, i.e. to ask for a revision of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's concession and also of the status of Bahrein. If such requests were ever -formulated I should at once inform the Persian Government that His Majesty's Government were not prepared to entertain thcm ? but I see no advantage whatever in anticipating such a contingency. On the contrary, if I were to make representations to the new Minister for Foreign Affairs immediately on his appointment, their effect might ■ well be to provoke the very reaction which we desire to prevent and incidentally would lend colour to the view that it is really we who have forced Qavam from office. Subject to your instructions therefore I propose to refrain from further action until the new Government is formed and has given some indication of policy which it intends to pursue.

Your telegrm No. 1259 [of the 5th December: public statements by the Persian Priae Minister]. The Persian Prime Minister's behaviour in this-matter is very unsatisfrotory. In the first place I understood the undertaking which you reported in your telegram No. 1154 [of the 7th November] to mean that he would keep you fully infor med if he had any reason to believe that a proposal to secure the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's help in economic and social matters was likely to take shape. In feert he has actually approached the Company and the first you heard about it was through his broadcast. In view of the breach of this under taking it is difficult to attach much importance to the further reassurances which Qavam has now given you. 2. Apart from this his public statements on the subject of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and of Bahrein arc deplorable. They are by implication most disparaging to the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and they convey the impression that sub stantial concessions are being sought. Anti-British feeling is thus quite needlessly stirred up, and, in the light of these statements, Qavam or some other Prime Minister may well in due course irgue that owing to the expectations of 'public opinion' he has no choice but to insist on important modifi cations to the Company's concession. 3. With regard to Bahrein Qavam knows very well that we do not and will not recognise the Persian clair. In seeking at this moment to raise a question which has remained dormant for some time his purpose appears to be to appease the Soviet Union by attacking His Majesty's Government. 4. A .4. I shall therefore be grateful if you will speak to Qavam in the sense of the preceding prragraphs and acid that, while I do not expect or desire speeches of fulsone praise for Britain, I think that after all I have done to support Persia's inde pendence, I hrvc the right to ask hin to refrain from making further public statements of this kind and from stirring up trouble against us. 5. I am asking the iXierican Embassy here to suggest to the State Department that the United States Ambassador in Tehran might speak to Qavam about the general undesirability of arousing feeling against His Majesty's Government and in particular to press the Persian Government not to raise their claim to Bahrein. 6. Now that Qavam is no longer Prime Minister I should be glad if you will take an early opportunity of informing his successor of the view which I have taken of his (Qavam's) utterances anil express the hope that he will not follow his example. 7. I leave the exact form of your representations to your discretion^BAHREIN ISLAND (STATUS) , ta f-f Dr - ^ ^ked the Secretary of tndp Jw- M eign ^ ffairs what is th e atti- Majesty s Government towards y change in the existing status nf Bahrein Island in the Persian Gulf Bahrein^r* 111 His Hi « hness the Sheikh of Bahrein is recognised as the ruler of an hifc^tv's r ,e under ,he p rotection of aiest y s Government and in special Treaty relations with them.

According to further information obtained here National Party representative was Abdullah Zireh. He appeared at Majlis on January ISth and asked for occupation of Bahrain by Persian troops and holding of elections there. He was told by Majlis President that Persian Government was anxious to recover Bahrain but it was premature to talk of occupation by force. Zireh was asked to produce evidence that he represented people of Bahrain aut could only reply that he had none as his organisation was working underground. 3. Shaikh of Bahrain has asked for issue through Haifa broadcasting station and also in Arabic broadcast from London of a strong denial fey himself that a deputation has gone from Bahrain to Persia to discuss political or any other matters. He suggests that it should be stated that Bahrain is an Arab State in treaty relations with the British Government. 4. 1 suggest that statement might issue to effect that the Shaikh has repudiated in strong terms the claim of the so called representative of the Bahrain National Party to represent the people of Bahrain and reaffirmed Bahrain's position as an independent Arab State in treaty relations with the British Government. - HAY - No. ?28-S PERSIAN GULF RLSIDtNCY, BAHRAIN, dated the 26th January,. 1948. Copy, v1th copy of telegram under reference, forwarded-with compliments to:- The Political Agent, Bahrain. K..Us The followijpig information has been received by me from an unimpeachable source: The Press in Tehran are giving much publicity to the arrival there of a person claiming to be the representatve of the people of Banrain. His name is Abdullah Zireh and he is reported to speak Persian with an Arabic accent. He appeared at the session of the Majlis on Sunday but was not permitted to enter the House although he talked with various Deputies outside it. He asked that Bahrain should be occupied immediately by Persian troops and tbat elections should be held there for a Deputy for the Majlis. Hikmat the President of the Persian Majlis is said to have told Zireh that although the Persian Government were most anxious to recover Bahrain it was too early to talk of sending troops there. When Zireh was called upon to adduce proof that he represented the people of Bahrain he is said to have replied that he could not produce any proof as the organisation he represented was an underground one. There is considerable excitement over the Bahrain question especially as it is coupled with news recently received that Persian troops have reoccupied the island of Ashuriyab. which is off Bandar Shah in the Caspian after it has been under Soviet control for six years. The Press calls upon Government to take similarly decisive steps to recover Bahrain and states that the Prime Minister has already entered into negotiations with the British on this subject 24th January 1948. it v&lt;CQMFIDENTIAL P.O.

The latter was a smuggler during the last war and has been to Persia for that purpose several times. He has a Persia lady in marriage. As regards the tendency of Abdullah Az-Zairah, nothing can be said with confidence, but whatever it may be, the man is not important socially. It may be worthy to note here thau the pro-Persian tendency of Abdullah Az-Zairah is noC amazing, the more since all -the Shi'as of Bahrain, by reason of religion and origin, have strong feelings towards Persia.(CYPHER TELF.GiiAj.

I note that in the enclosure to your printed Letter No.C/136 dated the 26th January, 1948 it is stated 'all the Shias of Bahrain by reason of religion and origin, have strong feelings towards Persia'. Is this true and is it also true ;that all the Shdas of Bahrain are of Persian origin ?

I do not think I have previously heard Persian origin ascribed to them. 3. In replying would you kindly let me have an estimate of the number of true Persians in the Island separately for Sunnis and Shias and let me know to what extent you consider that either or both of these are in sympathy with the Persian claim to Bahrain 4.

Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.T., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.4 Extract from demi-official letter No. C/701 dated 4.2.1948 from C.D. Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, to C.J. Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., political Agent, Bahrain. After the affair copies of a statement on the matter, which was published in an Indian newspaper, in English, were posted to a large number of people in Bahrain. I believe these letters were sent out by the Muharraq Club, whose president is Abdulaziz Shamlan. Some of the members assured His Highness that the Arabs had nothing to do with Abdullah Zeerah and that they had no wish to help the Persians. The affair has aggravated the feeling between Shias and Sunnis m Bahrain, especially between the Khalifah and the Bahama. Stories are now being circulated that during the summer a petition was signed by thousands of Shias which was then con veyed to Persia. I do not believe this. Do you think it would be a good idea if I sent some thing on these lines to the Times? 11 Abdul 1 a Zeera, who was reported on - by Reuters, Teheran, to have contacted members of the Persian Government representing himself as the leader of the Bahrain national party, is a youth of 22 years old. He was until recently a junior clerk in a commercial firm. He is a man of no political importance and has no following'.

At 4.15 p .m. yesterday, Abdollah Zlreh, the repre sentative of the people of Bahrain called at the Majless and after some informal talks with Abbas i^skandari and others, was ushered to the office of the president where the Vice president. Amir Hossein Zafar, acting for the president, received him and held talks with him in tne presence of a number of deputies. Zireh said:- ni represent the M Hezb-i-Melli' of Bahrain and, in fact, the whole people of Bahrain and am charged uo bring to the knowledge of the Iranian Parliament how we are anxious to join the geographical unit, of jran. We are prepared to do anything to be annexed to our motherland and* should we be assured of your support and action, we shall not fail to hold meetings and demonstrations to give vent to our desire. We highly appreciate the appropriate speeches made by Mr. Eskandari and we all confirm his views and actions.' On being asked what document he had to establish bis authority to speak for the people of Bahrain. Zireh sai i unat his party was still an underground organisation witn ^he principle to render the adhesion of Bahrain co .ran possible and that any credentials required could be asked for from tnem. He then handed to Mr. Eskandari a lett f r ' f v 0 the House, requesting the authorities to further their acti - ities for reclaiming Bahrain and to direct the people o. ; -hrain as to how they can best render their service and assistance. Other requests made in this/letter are as follows 1. Admission in the House of a deputy for Bahrain. 2.

In view of the present condition he considers that any increase in the Persian minority in Bahrain may have serious consequences in future. It is his wish to reduce the number of Persians who are now living in Bahrain and he therefore suggests that in future no permission should be granted to Persians resident here to visit Persia unless they are returning to their own country in order to stay there.

An alternative might be to prevail upon King Ibn Saud to hint to the Persians during discussions about the renewal of relations that he would prefer them to leave the question of Bahrein alone. But the effectiveness of this would of course depend upon the strength of the Persian desire to come to an under - standing with him. 5. Inaiy case it seemed to us that it might be advisable to let the matter rest for the time being in view of the possibility of an early change of government in Persia, see paragraph 4 of Tehran telegram No. 127. 4.

S- I forward herewith a copy of C.J, Pelly Esq. ,0.3,E,, Political Agent, BAHBAINThis incident occurred a time v/hen the British and Iranian Governments were already in controversy over a number of other questions - the Iranian Government's attitude toward the Kingdom of Iraq and treatment of the ci-devant Sheikh of Luhammarah; the Iranian Government's desire to secure the abrogation of the Capitulations; and the British Government's desire to obtain a settlement of debt-claims and a right of way across Iran for an air -route which the British Imperial Airways Corporation was seeking to open from England to India. A number of the out standing Anglo-Iranian controversies were settled by negotiation in the course of the year 1928; but the Bahrein controversy was not among them; and on the 28th ^u^uot 152d, tuu xx-diiotii Government addressed a fresh protest to the ur it ion uovcr^i.ient un the question of sovereignty, and another on tnc 3tii utuiuary, 1^29, against a newly introduced regulation uy Vvhich ai^ Iranian subjects visiting the islands were not) required, by the eheikh's go verniaent, to produce pass ports, such, as they vvoula have to produce in order to visit any foreign country, instead of being allowed to visiL Bahrein on the strength of permits, entitling them to travel from one Iranian port to another, which had been customarily issued by the Iranian authorities, and accepted by the Bahrein authorities in the case of Iranian visitors to Bahrein. The Iranian note of the 2nd August 1928 was answered in a long British note of the 18th February 1929&gt; in which the juridicial, as well as the historical, arguments in the Iranian note were combated in d e ta il. Yet another protest from the Iranian Government to the British Government was elicited, on the 23rd July 1930, by a statement, wiiich had appeared in the i'ress in the June of that year, that the sheikh of Bahrein had granted to a British v syndicate a concession for exploiting tjie possible c il-resources 01 the islands; and this was followed up, on the 22nd May 193U, by a similar protest - addressed in this case to the United btates Government with copies to all members, of the League of Nations - against a new report that the Sheikh of Bahrein had granted a concession to the Standard Oil Company of California, This latter report proved to be correct. Iran is by no means the only state which has laid claim to Bahrein. At various times claims to or assertions of sovereignty over Bahrein have been made by Musca't, Lgypt, the ^ahhabi ^rniro of the ^rab Mainland and Turkey. By far the most important 01 tiie-oe claimants was Turkey who between 18U7 and 191j&gt; pr^M,ea ner claim with no less insistence than Iran. The Turkish el^im iinally withdrawn in the Anglo-Turkish conventiOxj. or 1913' This convention was never ratified, but the witharawcil ji Ltie elaiia was confirmed by article 16 of the Treaty Oi Liausaiine oi 1923./2 THE PERSIAN CLAIM TO BAHREIN: THE BRITISH ATTITUDE Persian claims to and protests regarding Bahrein have formed the subject of correspondence between the Persian and British Governments at various times and particularly between 1873 and 1934. The last detailed representation made by the Persian Government was contained in a note delivered by the Acting Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the British Charge d' Affaires in Tehran on 2nd August 1928. In a reply to this note dated 18th February 1929 from the British Foreign Secretary to the Persian Minister in London, the arguments put forward by the Persian Government were examined in detail and found to be without substance. The following is the text of the British note of 18th Fob. 1929. SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN TO HOVHANNES KHAN MOSSAED ^ FOREIGN OFFICE, FEBRUARY 18, 1929. sir, In a note dated the 18th January, 1928, I had the honour to inform you, in reply to your note of the 26th November, 1927, respecting the claim advanced by your Government to the islands of Bahrein, that His Maje3ty T s Government in the United Kingdom were not aware of any -valid grounds upon which the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over those islands was or could be based. Some months later, on the 2nd August, 1928, the Persian Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty's Charge d' Affaires a-t Tehran a further note explaining in detail the reasons which have led his Government to consider themselves justified in advancing such a claim. I now have the honour to request that you will convey to your Government the following reply:- ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY THE PERSIAN GOVERNMENT 2. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have examined with the greatest care the views set forth in the Persian Government's note of the 2nd August, and have endeavoured to extract from the many unsupported declarations that Bahrein forms an integral part of Persia (a statement which, as I have already indicated in my note under reference, bears no relation ^o geographical facts), the essential arguments on which this claim is based. They note that the Persian Government do not in any way base their claim on the alleged recogniLion of their rights in the past by His Majesty's Government. So far as can bo deduced from their note under reply, their claim is, in fact, founded on three main arguments: Firstly, on uninterrupted possession except for the period of Portuguese occupation between 1507 and 1622; secondly, on an alleged principle of international lav/ that a territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully de tached so long as its annexation by another State or its indepen dence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory; and, thirdly, on docum. nts of a date later than the end of the 18th century, in which the sneikhs of the islands are alleged to have declared thet-submiss ion to the Persian Government, and on the alleged payment by them of tribute to the Persian Govern ment, After full examination of these arguments His Majesty's Government have reached the conclusion, for the reasons given below, that they entirely fail to substantiate a Persian claim to sover eignty over the islands at the -nresent dav.3|7 - 2 - ^SIA N CLAIMS jiDCArilNED; a) UNINTERRUPTED POSSESSION 3, In the first place, the statement that ''Bahrein has always and uninterruptedly formed part of Persia in past cen- n^oo'.r'J exc ' : P the Portuguese occupation from 150? to z. , ' 13 not on e which can bo allowed to pass unquestioned. I have already drawn attention to the evident fact that geo- graphically this assertion is misleading. Historically it is linn ^si^ding. The earlier history of the islands before 1507 is obscure, but it cannot seriously be maintained , vi w ^ rc; ^ubject to Persian sovereignty all through the Arab, Mongol and Tartar invasions and the anarchy of the Middle Agl ; s : On the contrary, modern historians have expressed the fV? ln J 0 {] Ji 1 ?' from the 11th to the beginning of the 16th century ' ^habitants of Bahrein were subject, to chiefs of their own ^^ and ^ ^ on g contemporary writers, the Arabian geographer, 1 '-? !' rr i 1 ^: ln ?u 1 ^ thG lattcr half of the 12th century, stated ^ th ? i- 3 land was then governed by an indepen- fi' ; . 1 13 ' th G^fore, impossible to accept the view that the island was continuously subject to Persia before 1507. Between the years 1507 and 1622 the islands were occupied by the Portuguese as the Persian Goyernment themselves admit. The T Slan rule bc san in 1622 and ended in 1785, when' troops were finally driven out of the islands by fn -h^ a 03 rS i 0 ;v Present Sheikh of Bahrein, but it is not d that cvon durin g this period of Persian ascen- danc Pui sian rule was continuous and unchallenged, or that it brought peace and prosperity to the inhabitants/' The Persian occupation after the expulsion of the Portuguese was of un- f Ut ^ S S 0rnS t0 b0 03 tabHshed that about the ^ .r; descent was made upon the island by the Omani Ar bs who then o 0 0 upied It for a short period. In the mldSe of too ' th century control appears to have passed into the hands of the once powerful Huwala Arabs, who ever at the pr, sent day are • y ro P r « E 5;ntcd there, though in 1753 Persia was again able to assert her ascendancy by conquest. In 1783 however the troops of Kis Majesty-the Shah were finally driven out by the js&amp;ass&amp;r tho of po,,ai ' ^5 £ cont^ 1 n ri^ 1 n 1 th b0 &lt;,vi ^ nt from tho ^rief historical summary ovld-i^n 5 the preceding paragraph that such historical cvid,.nce as can be adduced in favour of the Persian claim must Government cannot but regard the cl ilm • 2 . 2 Md J? st y' s from Persia as abunde.ntjy esteblished?

Even if this statement could bo accepted as valid, it would still be necessary for Persia to prove that she is, or^even has been, tho lawful owner of Bahrein, and that such rights as she nay have acquired in forner age£? b t conquest and the exercise of force outweigh those not only ol the Portuguese, but of the Arab inhabitants themselves, 6. His Majesty's Government, however, denv without hesita tion that any such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, i orris part of international law. The assertion that, the consent of the dispossessed State is invariably required to validate a change of sovereignty is contradicted both by _international practice and the facts of history. Moreover it would, if it existed, seriously prejudice the maintenance if peace and International order. It would bo open to any State to advance a claim to territory, of which it has not for cen- tunes been m effective possession, on tho ground that its ioss of possession in distant ages had not been confirmed by a subsequent treaty. To assert such a legal principle would be to assert that on a disputed question of territory the one factor that is decisive is the expressed will of one'of the a iS pi;i h 0 ' t i ie contrary, in cases where a territory has efiectively established its independence of the former sover- ; c - rj ^ '■ r ^ which the disposed owner recognises its in — ?ha? n C3 ? iefly valuable ^ conclusive evidence ■u- ^ G;; 0i - t.iQ xormer sovereign, such indpendence has ^ tabliShed - In Such Sasos tho effective estab^shment by ^ the territory of its independence is the ecidmg factor in the question of international title, and in u e case of Bahrein His Majesty's Government regard as wholly untenabie the proposition that effective possession and adninis- tration by the present ruling family for 145 vears, d^rinr which these rulers have been independent of Persia and during cin C be n af?ected n bv^hG rity haS b ?r eX0rcised in their dominions, can oe allected by tho mere consideration that the Persian recopnis ins the to a document formally recognising the fact of their mcipendence. nrecedont- ' abu ' dantl y clear from historical p 3ccdonto that the theory of the nocossity for the formal eon- Int rn tion' 1 ? 13P033 f 3SOd S ^ tto 13 not one which has ever 'obtained international acceptance.

The only other argument advanced by the Persian Govern ment in support of their claim is the statement that the sheikhs of Bahrein at some time later than the end of the 18th century declared in writing their entire submission and fidelity to the Persian Government, and that they paid tribute to the Persian Government. Although the Persian Government do not give any details in corroboratipn of this assertion, and although it would probably be difficult at the present day to prove the authen ticity of any documents which may be in'their possession. His Majesty»s Government are perfectly prepared to admit the pos sibility that such documents may exist. They do not, however, consider that the existence of such documents, or even evidence, - were this forthcoming, of payments by the Rulers of Bahrein to the Government of the Shah can be regarded as establishing the vali dity of Persia's claim. They have always been well aware that the unfortunate rulers of the islands, surrounded by warlike and more powerful States which menaced their independence, professed on various occasions during the first sixty or seventy years of the 19th century an unwilling allegiance of Muscat, to Persia ( Turkey, to the rulers of the mainland of Arabia, even to any Power, in short, who would agree to offer them und seemed at the time in a strong enough position to that a- different times for sho^ periods they paid Muscat, Egypt, or.the Wahabi Arabs of the mainland. Any argument based on payment of tribute would, therefore, be available in support of a claim to sovereignty over Bahrein by ?nL 0 to which tribute was, in fact, paid, and, in any „ ' , 3 that this timid and vacillating policy pursued occasion by his predecessors cannot be hold to affect the 0 ;, th ' present sheikh, who is firm in his determination „ &lt; ® ! Persian Government's claims, and has .empowered His ■ Majestyts Government to rofuto them on his behalf, in virtue of the treaties which give them the right of defending Bahrein from external aggression. VALIDIT V OF PERSIAN CLAIMS NEVER ADMITTED ... ' In view of the fact that the Persian Government do not S^ rt T /[ 0f . t ^ 8ir claim on the all6 g^ recognition of that claim b:/ His Majestyf S Government in the past, it seems unneces sary here to reply m detail to the various arguments by which the Persian Government endeavour to show that thoir claims have Zll r T eoo enitiqn in the past. I have already, in my - note of the 18th January, 1928, explained that it has never an th S lrltentio n 'f His Majesty's Government to admit the validity of Persies claimsand I must now ask the Persian Government to believe that a further full and careful examination of the contemporary records confirms that statement in its entirety. Ever sinco the year 1820, when His Maiestv's r/i 1 ' 3 * 3n1 f ered int 0 special treaty relations with' the ^ 4.C Bahrein without any reference, to the Government of tho they have acted on the assumption that the sheikh is an ^ n ' G ? GnC ? ent rul f 3 r* In 1822 &gt; when Captain William Bruce was^called z,' havin g negotiated the terms of an agreement with the Prince Shiraz without their authority, the main reason recorded 1 and for tho prompt disavowal of this tentative agreement is that 'it acknowledges the King of Persia's title to BahrJin. of which there is not the least proof,' No clearer state- f f &gt; ment could Government since seen possibly.have at that date any reason f to been made of the views held by His more than a century ago; they have alter their opinion. Majes ty's never-'V « torn - D - 10. Tho Earl of Clarendon's note of the 29th Aprils 1869, to which the Persian Government devote so large a part of their note now under reply, was certainly never intended to bear the interpretation now placed upon it by the Persian Governnent. As was pointed out in my note of the 18th January, 1928, it admitted that the Persian Government had advanced a claim to Bahrein, it stated that due consideration had been given to their claim, but it did not admit that their claim was valid, I j even afiirms the intention of the British Government to con~ tinue to hold the sheikhs to the treaty engagements which had been entered into with them as independent rulers. His Majesty's Government are entirely unable to admit that an implicii; acknow- ledgment of tne valid ty of the Persian claims is constituted by the reference in that note to- the considerations which led to the establishment and the maintenance of those treaty rela tions; nor can they agree that the dependence -or otherwise of Bahrein on Persia can in any way be affected by the fact that in entering upon and maintaining their treaties with the sheikhs they were principally moved by a desire to suppress piracy and the slave trade and to maintain.the police of the Gulf, duties which the Persian Government .themselves* were not in a position effectively to perform. It is true that at that time Her Majesty's Government were mainly influenced by thy consideration that they, like Persia, were interested in the safety of the Persian Gulf for commerce, and'that they would gladly have accepted Persia's cooperation in maintaining order had her naval position admitted of it| but although they aid not consider Persia's claims to ownership to be valid, the^- wore ^not at that time directly concerned in refuting them. The special treaties by which they eventually agreed to accept the control of the sheikh's foreign relations were concluded at a later date. ' • . - I INDEPENDENT STATUS OF BAHREIN SHEIKHS 11. to take for the of your enjoyed as the I must in this connexion invite the Persian Government note of the fact that there is no conceivable ground su Gf;) es tion in the last paragraph of the second section Government's note under reply that the independent status b/ the rulers of Bahrein can in any sense be represented result of ''rebellion at a foreign State's instigation.' This suggestion is one which His Majesty's Government repudiate- as entirely unjustifiable. When in 182C, consequent on their of . the .' p J ratical activities of &gt;he independent rulers f the trucial coast of Oman, they found it necessary to consider ohe position in regard to Bahrein, nearly forty years had elapsed since the conquest of this island by the ancestor of the present sheiWi, and during those years Persia had exercised no dominion in the islands and appeared to have taken no measures to re-establish her position. They had•accordingly no hesitation in antering. mto. negotiations and concluding a treaty with the ru l e . r without prior reference to the Government of the bnan. Their object,as stated by Lord Clarendon in 1869, was the suppression of piracy and the maintenance of peace in the Gulf• 4-^'^ ^ G . C;ril l ned themselves to the measures necessary to' t n v 7 hi l e It might have been open to them to establish their dominion over the sheikh, they did not choose ao contented themselves with an arrangement to secure the hnrXi^ international shipping without imposing on themselves onlv ? S p a Vi 0 is trat; ion. They maintained this position not in 184 ft wbnn ^ 0I V ° 0 2 nsi0ns in subsequent years, and notably fw u?' !, ? ^ hey ^oiined to aocodo to the sheikh's request ■; hi dominions should be incorporated in those of Her Majesty the Queen. The treaty or 1820, by which the Sheikh of Bahrein 'bound himsGlf to abstain from plunder and piracy by land and sea, from the slave traffic and from inter-tribal war was ^ ( - 1 ^ owe( ? lo,±7 ^ in 1856, and 1861 by further treaties esignea to secure the same objects- the suppression nf slavery and the general pacification of the Gulf in the interests ji international shipping. The British Government concluded all these treaties with the sheikh ae£ an indepen- dent rulur, and consistently refused throughout to admit the Turkish, orsian and other claims to sovereignty over his dominions. It was not until the treaty of 1861 that Her Majesty's Government, in return for the sheikh's undertakinp to abstain irom maritime aggression, war and piracy, assured ^ their support against similar aggression, nor till a still later period in 1880 and 1892. that they £ took^ upon themselves the unqualified liabilitv for the r( flations of that ruler, under which he has now in- as ^ 1 ^ anco in repelling what he not unnaturally r - ds ao a wholly unprovoked attempt on his independence by a foreign Government. i uj a CONCLUSION - ^ lc '* In conclusion. His Majesty's Government cannot refnin from expressing their surprise that the Persian Government should have referred in this,correspondence to article 10 of the ovenant thu League of Nations, under which the members of he League undertake the respect and preserve as against ex- ^ a f 63 - 0 ^ S1Ori 'i the territnri ^l integrity and existing -^dependence of all members of the League: and'th^t they should seemingly imagine; that the terms of this article ay , ari ^^^-S-'^xon on members of the League to support Persian pretensions to an island which is separated from Persia by the whole width of thu Persian Gulf, and over which Persia has exercised no authority for 145 years. ■ ;1 11 be evident to the Persian Government that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have carefully ^ ? + -. irgU ? entS advancG d in the note now under reply and.that although they have found no reason to modify their previous opinions, their attitude is dictated by their genuine conviction that those arguments are untenable, and is in no way inspired by a policy hostile to Persia's ieritimate aspirations They cannot believe that the true^nterests of be ^ e ^ VGd by a continued refusal to recognise the 1 ng standing independence of the State of Bahrein.

Thursday 1st Bahman 1326. 22nd January 1948. Abdulla Zeera, representative of the people of Bahrain who is now in Teheran, explains the political situation of Bahrain for our readers. HOW THE ENGLISH HAVE ESTABLISHED A FIRM CONTROL OVER BAHRAIN. Explanation. This is one of the series of the articles Hi which the Bahrain representative, Abdulla Zeera, who has come to Teheran has written for our readers 'In today's article I wish to draw the attention of the Iranian Government io the way in which the British Government established itself in Bahrain during the rule of Shaikh Isa bin All (the previous issue of this paper contained the tyranny and cruelty Tor //hich that rule is known) by treaty. I want that the Iranian Government should pay special attention to che clauses of che treaty so that in its future efforts it should know well the pre vious political history of Bahrain. in the year 1867 Shaikh Isa bin Ali became a faithful servant of the British Government on one side, and on the other his tyranny over and encroachment on the poor people of Bahrain reached its climax. Some people of influence watched the actions of. Shaikh Isa and through their influence were able to minimise his cyranny over the people. Shaikh Isa complained to the Bricish Government. The British deported those people so that the ground would be cleared frnfti* them to attain their objects in Bahrain. Afterwards in the year 1870 another treaty between the British Government and Shaikh Isa bin Ali was concluded. The said Shaikh as the Governor of Bahrain and Colonel Ross and his assistant Sir Lewis Felly on behalf of the British Government signed it. in this treaty it was mentioned thac the political Agent in Bushirehid full powers of supervision over the islands of Bahrain. The most important clauses of this treaty were:- (a) To protect Bahrain from attack by foreigners. (b) To end the slave trade. (c) To*protect public rights: from this it is clear that the contents of this treaty have given complete authority over Bahrain islands to the British and the weak Bahrain State could no longer resist their power. The object of the first clause was to get complete control over affairs in Bahrain. / Che•......— -2- The object of the second clause was to show their justice, friendship and their interest for the country. • The object of the third clause was also a pretence to show that they wished to protect the rights of the public and in this disguise to inter fere with the affairs of the people. Here it is correct to say that the British . policy during those years tried through various means to create misunderstanding between the Persian and Arabic speaking communities. The British political Agent also published that he was responsible for public security and that all disputes and cases should be referred to him for decision. The British political Agenc was successful. Persians who had some self respect did not approve of this and openly criticized, which was resented by the British. Slowly he tried to overcome these criticisms and in the end the influence of the British over Bahrain was complete through Shaikh Isa who submitted all the affairs in their hands. Shaikh Isa had no complaint against the Iranian Government:. He saw that the British Government established a regular Govern ment and handed over all the affairs to them and whatever this master ordered him to do he did. He did not know that a day would come when the Iranian Government would demand its rights in Bahrain and the injustice shown to the people and the 'Tudeh' of Bahrain who are striving to at Cain liberty will be brown off the horizon by the shouts 'Death to the Colonizers''. nOUTWARD TELEGRAM S3o Jp i Cypher/OTP ■ .

The 16th of Ifarch, 1948. sj17 I have made inquiries about the size and position of the Persian minority in Bahrain as requested in your demi-official letter No.310-3 dated the 3rd February, 1948, and although I am far from satisfied as to the results, I am for warding them in order not to delay further a r9ply - ^ 2. Firat of all, I enclose copies of my letter No. C/181, dated the 9th February, 1948, to Bel- grave, and of his reply. From the latter I have found it a little difficult to draw precise con clusions, but I am not blaming Belgrave for this; the fact is that in all such inquiries we are often defeated by trying to define terms which have locally very loose applications, and by seeking categorical replies where it is impossible to give them. The categories mentioned by Belgrave are: (1) Bahama (2) Persian Shias - 'AJem' (3) Persian Sunnis and Holies. I agree with Belgrave that (so far as I can define them at all) the number of ,, true Persians' in Bahrain is of the order of 20,000 and I think that they are divided in the proportion of 15,000 : 5,000 between categories 2 and 3. You will notice that in Belgrave^ letter he admits that there are elements in all three categories ready to support the Persian claim. As to categories 2 and 3, if I were asked to state categor ically whether they are in favour of it, I would hazard the statement that they are. The Persian Shias, I understand, attend the Persian primary school, but that is as far as they can get in Persian education in Bahrain. There are, of course, no restrictions on their speaking their own language. This replies to paragraph 3 of your letter. 3. I revert to the Bahama. My information is that they number about 12,000 and that the vast majority of real Bahama - and, by this I mean the descendants of the putative aboriginal tribe and not people of Persian origin - live in the villages, and are at present polit ically of no account. To these latter, the remark about the /S hia s...... The Hon 1 ble Lt-Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C. I.E., C.S.I., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, r . ^ '• Bahrain. , i ho iu..;. : c? .]&lt;*_ : co!.-; r-..■ ■. i '.'c:.ds i- -2- Shias of Bahrain quoted in paragraph 2 of your letter was not meant to apply. But, I believe it is a fact that a very large number of people describing themselves as Baharna, and being of course Shias and living in the towns are of Persian origin, e.g. Hasan Mudafi's family who come from Lingeh. Furthermore, it is common to hear the question asked as to whether a man is a 'Baharani' or 'Sunni'. Belgrave gives, or estimates the number of Shias at 50,000 though I have heard it put at a higher figure. If we take 16,000 of these as being 'true Persians' and 12,000 as Baharna (i.e. racially speaking real Baharna of 'aboriginal' origin), we are still left with 23,000 Shia to be accounted for. I do not want to delay this letter by referring again to Belgrave, but I don f t think his letter gives the prominence to this element that they deserve. They, I think, are the towns people describing themselves as Baharna but really of Persian origin and containing politically conscious and active elements. My information is that they are pro- Persian. 4. So far as it goes, this letter also seems to reply to your demi-official letter NO.460-S, dated the 21st February, 1948. NS.Copy of demi-official letter No,c/181 dated the 9th February, 1948, from C.J. Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Polit ical Agent, Bahrain, to C.D. E?q., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. ---: Our Ambassador In Teheran is, for reasons which you can well imagine, a.^lrlng for information on the internal situation in Bahrain, and, in particular, on the size and position of the Persian minority, in a letter which you wrote to me a couple of years ago (your demirj ^fficial letter No. 1389-9A dated the 22nd July, 1945) you gave the number of Persians as 7,647. Would this t)e about the number now? If not, can you let me know what it is? - 2. As regards the distribution of Sunnis and Shias you estimated (enclosure to vour memorandum N0 .1798-9A dated the 21st August, 1946jQthe total population of the Island at about 100,000 half of them being Shias and half Sunnis. I have had a report that 'all the Shias of Bahrain by reason of religion and origin, have strong feeling towards Persia', perhaps you would comment on this? presumably it is not true of the Baharnah? I have never heard them described as Persians. 3. I have always believed that the 'true Persians' (as distinct from the 'holies') in the Island are all Shias. Is this correct? It is the figure for such 'true' Persians which I am anxious to get. Do you consider that all of those are in sympathy with the Persian claim to Bahrain? I imagine the poorer ones do not care one way or another, and probably do not even know of the question.■ q» # l».v . o. 7«a mannranh February 17, 1©48 It io difficult to p^ve accurrte ropll^is to some of th (2 luutitlons 1 i /our lettor ilo, c /101 of 9th Foby. 1940, Iri which you u »K for inforra ^tion about the nuia- bfir of jralans novl in Bahrain* Accord in. to tha onnaus tiikon in 1940, which was the first consus ovor made jji Bahrfiin, 7,[347 parsons were re ; dctored as be ing Per .si an subjects, that is to say at the time of the census they described theioselves as Persian nationals, but it cannot be asnuioed that these were the only people of i'Mrniim nationality then resident in Bahrain. e did not go into the qu&lt;jntion of nationality very tho- rou ^ily at th t time, our object was to i»ak« a count of the population, ao riany paople who were r ot Bahrain sub jects may have described themselves as Bahrain subjects. The nuabor of Persians in Bahrain has increa sed very con siderably since then, during 1945, 1946 and 1947 nbout 3,000 Persians entered Bahrain, with travel docuraents juoatly from Dubai nni Bharjah, describing them as sub jects of those states, but as many of these Persians scarcely knevv a word of Arabic it was obvious that they were not ( onuine residents of the Trucial Coast, we ■ believe that the number of Persians who have entered the country illegally is not much less than the number who have come with passes, hen once they ^ot to Bahrain vary few Persians seem to les ve the country, except on vi^iti:. to rarf ia irom which they return. Apart fro i the census returns we have no figures showing the number of Persians in iiahr iin so I cannot rive an estimate sup® ported by facts but I am of the opinion that there are not less thtoi &lt;20,000 Persians now living in Bahrain, byby this figuro I nBan people who clalra to b(3 PoralRn eubjoctc.

A,i?.5a note • i place below a note which 1 handed to Sir Reader Builard on the subject of the difficulties that ariae over the present attitude of the Persian Government towards Bahrain and other Arab Gulf States in the matter of travel facilities. 2. 1 discussed this question at considerable length with Sir Reader Bullard and also with Mr .Squire. Sir Reader was oflopinion that the Persian Government's attitude merely caused a certain amount of inconvenience and that it was undesirable in view of our present position in the country to press them too far in this matter. He considered that the recognition by them of British endorse ments to Bahrain etc. on travel documents would amount to a formal abandonment of their claim to sovereignty, i did not agree and gave it as my opinion that it should be possible to persuade them to accept such endorsements etc. for the duration of the war on the same basis as that on which they agreed to the restoration of direct telegraphic commtnications between Bushire and Bahrain, viz. that each side should agree that this concession would be for the duration of the war and would not a^ply any change in the attitude of either to the Persian claim to Bahrain. 3. i gathered that H.M.Minister will probably represent the whole matter to the 'Foreign Office, if he does t-hcn i shall have an opportunity of giving my views in detail. 4. if, however, he takes no action i shal} probably send a copy of my note to the india Office and the Government of india by air mail and press for action to be taken at Tehran. 5. Meanwhile will office please clear up the following / pointsGovernment of India only. There seems no reason how ever why copy of letters referring to the opinion should not have been sent to us, and we may ask for copy, D.f.a. It seems preferable not to send copy of these 7. papers to Bahrain. There has been correspondence in the past on 8'. some of the points mentioned in Mr. Baxter's letter e.g. the difficulties (on the Arab Coast) that the mere dis cussion of the question on a political basis might in volve us in, and if you wish to see the earlier corres pondence it will be put up. Whatever views have, however, been held in the past, H.M.G. is now bound by the United Nations Charter, and resulting local difficulties will just have to be faced. ✓ ( 27.1.46. p ^ £■*4* * x4f, ^ @ &lt;9, -h.o.No. f. diin-i-ti. • ix i7% - tfficL *** S ■ Cf tr &amp; ^4. /U ^ ^ ffi-. • ^ ^ lo 458 lorsqu'il demande au Gouvernement de Tlnde britannique de pourvoir a l emission de timbres-poste surcharges ainsi qu'il est pr^vu presentement.

APPENDIX II SUBMISSION OF THE QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF THE PERSIAN CLAIM TO BAHREIN TO THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN BY THE FOREIGN OFFICE (1934) [E 5011/2369/91/1934] Foreign Office to Law Officers of the Crown Gentlemen, * Foreign Office, July 23, 1934. I HAVE the honour, by direction of Secretary Sir John Simon, to transmit to you the papers noted in the accompanying list and to request the favour of your opinion on the subject of the rights claimed by Persia in the Archipelago of Bahrein. 2. Bahrein is a small archipelago lying on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf and almost land-locked by the Arabian province of Hasa in the dominions of Ibn Saud, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, and by the peninsular of Qatar, which is the territory of the independent Arab Sheikh of Qatar. The population of Bahrein is essentially Arab by race, though since the beginning of the present century there has been a considerable influx of Persian nationals. 3. The archipelago is of considerable commercial importance. The pearl banks by which it is surrounded make it the centre of a pearl trade which, in good years, is of very considerable dimensions, while oil has recently been discovered there. Its strategic position in the centre of the Persian Gulf, always important, has become still more so of late years with the development of the air route to India and the possibility that it may be desirable to use the island as a British naval station. 4. A historical memorandum prepared by the India Office, and dealing in detail with the history of Bahrein both before and after 1783 is attached (Paper A). It is conceived that the answers to the question as to which your advice is desired will depend almost entirely on the view taken of the historical facts there set out, and it has therefore been thought necessary to state those facts in detail. The situation may, however, be summarised as follows :— 5. The Sheikhdom was for some time prior to 1783 under Persian rule. The Persians were in that year driven out of the islands by Arabs from the mainland of Arabia under the leadership of the direct ancestor of the present ruling house, in whom sovereignty has rested since that date. Claims to sovereignty, or possibly in some cases suzerainty, over Bahrein have repeatedly been preferred by Persia since 1783. They were also preferred by Turkey (suzerain up to the war of the adjoining mainland) with great insistence on a number of occasions between 1847 and 1913, in which latter year the Turkish Government finally recognised the independence of the island; and they have been put forward in the past by Muscat; by Egypt; and by the Wahabi Amirs of the Arab mainland. Tribute was last certainly paid to Persia in 1799. It has at one time or other between 1800 and 1870 been paid also to Muscat, to Egypt, and to the Wahabi Amirs, although in the case of the last-named, at any rate in the more recent period, possibly only in respect of possessions on the mainland of Arabia. Bahrein, at least since 1820, has consistently been regarded as independent by His Majesty's Government, who have been in special treaty relations with its rulers on that basis since that date. Those treaty relations (which have throughout involved contingent liabilities for protection) were strengthened in 1861, while by engagements contracted in 1880 and 1892 the ruling house have undertaken obligations which place their external relations in the hands of His Majesty's Government and preclude them from ceding territory save to, or with the consent of, His Majesty's Government.6. In 192&lt;, 1928 and 1929 important notes were exchanged between His Majesty s Government and the Persian Government in regard to the latter s claim to Bahrein, of which copies have been communicated to the Secretary- General oi the League of JSations for communication to the States Members of the League. Copies of these notes are attached as Paper B. On five other occasions since 1927 the Persian Government have addressed protests to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, or communicated to him copies of protests against alleged violations of their sovereignty, which they claim over the Bahrein islands. Copies of the Persian Government's letters to the Secretary-General of the League are attached as Papers C-G. In the first four ol these latter cases, His Majesty's Government thought it unnecessary to return replies. In the case of the latest Persian protest (Paper G), His Majesty's Government have drawn the attention of the Secretarv-General to their notes to the Persian Government of January 1928 and February 1929 (see Paper B) and requested him to circulate this reply to the Members of the League. In January 1933, the International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union circulated to the members of the union a protest from the Persian postal authorities regarding the proposed issue of Indian postage stamps, surcharged ' Bahrein,' and in April the bureau circulated the reply of the Indian postal authorities (Paper H). 7. On political and strategical grounds it is regarded as of the first importance to retain the status quo in Bahrein and to continue to reject the claims put forward by Persia. His Majesty's Government, however, are anxious, to enable them to consider how best to deal with any further assertion of the Persian claim, for the advice of the Law Officers as to whether Persia possesses any rights in Bahrein. 8. While the Persian claim has been asserted with great insistence over a very long period of years, the grounds adduced in support of it have varied from time to time and have never been stated by the Persian Government in any very ^reat detail. The fullest expression of the Persian attitude is that contained m the notes of the 26th November, 1927, and the 2nd August, 1928. The various arguments which from time to time Persia has advanced in support of her claim are as follows :— (1) ihe history of the islands prior to 1783. Persia contends that an appeal to history shows that prior to this date the islands were from a remote period subject, and tributary, to her. (2) The absence of Persian consent to the detachment of Bahrein, admittedly at one stage prior to 1783 a Persian possession, from Persia; and the fact that Persia has never recognised the islands as independent and has consistently urged a claim to them. (3) Certain provisions of the treaty (unratified and disavowed by both parties) concluded between Captain Bruce, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Minister of the Prince Governor of Shiraz, in 1892. (4) A gold coin alleged to have been struck at Bahrein in 1817. (5) Payment by Bahrein at various stages of ' peeshkesh ' offerings, or tribute to Persia. (6) Flying of the Persian flag by the Sheikh of Bahrein. (7) Letters from past rulers of Bahrein admitting Persian suzerainty. (8) A note addressed by His Majesty's Government in April 1869 to the Persian Minister in London. (9) Closeness of relations at the present day between Persia and Bahrein. 9. The arguments referred to in the preceding paragraph are briefly examined in paragraphs 147-152 of the historical memorandum (Paper A) attached, which suggests the conclusion that they afford no solid basis for a Persian claim to sovereignty or suzerainty over the island of Bahrein. 10. Apart from the arguments based on historical events, the only important legal consideration which has been advanced by the Persian Government in support of their claim is that contained in paragraph 2 of the note addressed by the Acting Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Charg^ d'Affaires at Tehran on the 2nd August, 1928 (p. 4, Paper B). You will observe that a detailed reply to this argument was made in paragraphs 5-8 of the note addressed by Sir Austen Chamberlain to the Persian Minister in London on the 18th February, 1929 (pp. 8 and 9, Paper B). Reference may also be made in this connexion to the article entitled ' Sovereignty, Seisin and the League' by Sir John Fischer Williams {British Yearbook of International Law, 1926, /?. 24). 85-177 tt60 11. I have accordingly the honour to request you to take the enclosed papers into your consideration, and to advise, in the light of the facts stated in the historical memorandum (Paper A), the various arguments which have been employed on either side in the course of the discussion of this question, and of any other considerations which may appear to you to be relevant, whether, in your opinion, Persia possesses any rights in or over Bahrein, and if so what the nature of those rights is. 12. The question of the future policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to Persia, as to which the Ministerial Middle East Sub-Committee may have to take important decisions at any moment, may be to a considerable extent dependent upon the nature of vour opinion on the above point, and Sir John Simon would therefore be grateful if it were possible for you to furnish your opinion at a very early date.

Report The Persian claim to sovereignty over Bahrein appears to be based upon the view that from time immemorial the islands were Persian territory, and that by virtue of the fact that Persia has never expressly recognised their independence, coupled with various assertions of sovereign right on the part of Persia, and of admissions from time to time of the Persian claims on the part of the rulers of Bahrein and of His Majesty's Government, Persian sovereignty has never been lost. The facts as narrated in the historical memorandum prepared by the India Office do not, in our opinion, support this view. There is no satisfactory evidence of any kind that at any date before 1783 Bahrein was incorporated in Persian territory. The most that can be said is that there was a period of Persian occupation at the beginning of the 17th century, and that for a short period in the 18th century a de facto control was exercised by a Persian Governor. Whether this control ever acquired the character of de jure sovereignty may be doubted, but, in our opinion, the expulsion of the Persian garrison in 1783 never to return makes it impossible to rely upon what had happened before that event. The later history of Persian claims to sovereignty over the islands affords no evidence of any recognition either by His Majesty's Government or by any other sovereign power of Bahrein as Persian soil. The Bruce Treaty of 1822 cannot be relied on, while the three treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 appear to us to be wholly silent as to Persian rights over Bahrein. The British note of 1869 is the high-water mark of any admission of Persian rights. Even this note, however, falls far short of a recognition of sovereignty, and nothing said or done thereafter gives any support to Persian claims. Even if Persia were able as a matter of historical fact to show that Bahrein had been Persian territory prior to 1783. the fact that she has never expressly recognised Bahrein's independence affords, in our view, no foundation for her present claim. We agree with the arguments on this point in paragraphs 5 to 8 of Sir Austen Chamberlain's letter of the 18th February, 1929. i i% 61 I i * i Upon a review of all the facts as stated in the memorandum and of the arguments advanced in the course of the correspondence in recent years, we are of opinion that Persia has no right? ^ither of sovereignty or suzerainty, in or over Bahrein.

Many people migrated to the Arab coast ports and accepted the nationality of the Arab Shaikhs, c&gt;o«e persons who could not do so paid bribes and lived quietly with the Shaikhs and did what ever they liked.

Trom 1310 9 Persiaf under Hexa Shah, regained some of her old power and as the late Shah was Interested In safe-guarding the Interests of Persia abroad and because the Shaikhs of the Oman coast were troubling the Persians, he opened conwunlcatlons with Shaikh Said and established friendly relations In the spring of that year. He Issued Instructions to all Persian ports that none of the Shaikhs should be allowed to enter Persia without permission. The sane Shaikh Said was turned out of (*lsai Island after three days, and until 1321 none of the Shaikhs was seen In the Persian porta. This Haurua as a result of the carelessness of Government officials the Shaikhs with all show of authority returned to the beautiful Islands and ports of the Persian Gulf without any formalities or permission.
