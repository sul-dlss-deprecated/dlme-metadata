It then addresses Sir Lewis Pelly's appointment as temporary Resident and the critical state of affairs he was greeted with on arriving in Baroda, including the Gaekwar's lack of substantial progress in implementing the reforms the British Government had instructed him to make and the investigations into the attempted poisoning which revealed in December 1874 that it had been undertaken at the instruction of the Gaekwar.The report further details the considerations given as to how to handle the matter of the attempted poisoning of a British Resident, the need for an enquiry in order to provide the opportunity for cross-examination of witnesses and defence and the need for him to be removed as ruler in order for such an enquiry to take place. The individuals chosen to serve on this commission are described in detail, along with the importance of emphasising the intention to restore Baroda to native rule once the enquiry was complete and other complications such as the resignation of the Minister for Baroda which left Sir Lewis Pelly to conduct the whole administration of affairs for the state including undertaking reforms which had been promised by the Gaekwar.The report concludes with Lord Northbrook's thoughts on the course of action the British Government has taken and his hopes that the Princes of India will be able to recognise the justice and moderation that have been shown through the process and not be alarmed by what has taken place.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Special Commission, Baroda</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x000390#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
