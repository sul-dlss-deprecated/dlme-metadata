I am directed by the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to request you kindly to furnish me with the names of reliable and trustworth merchants in Debai. 2* This informatiin is required for transmission to the Department of Overseas Trade, London. ■ E/ I have received a letter from a personal friend of mine. Shaikh Saleh Barahim Bashin. He is living in Aden at the moment and he deals in Guano* He has asked me whether any of the islands on the Trucial Coast or Qatar have quantities of Guano on them. As far as I recollect, I heard something about these birds, some sea birds, etc., when I was down at Abu Dhabi and got the impression that some of the islands belonging to Abu Dhabi had quantities of the stuff on them. I should be grateful if you would let me know whether you can obtain any information as I would like to pass it on to my friend who will, if the information is satisfactory, take the necessary steps to obtain a Concession. For your own information. He tells me that Kha^id Abdul Latif will probably not go to Kuwait as he is engaged in building a dwelling house in Aden. I am told that it is a very nice house and I gather that Khalid has been making money, Khan Sahib Saiyid Abdur Razzaq, Residency Agent, Sharjah.IKO.No.739-34/3. Dated the 18th August 1937. Respected Sir, Reference your D.O. No.1605-10/1 dated the 6th July 1937. Guano can be had in large quantities in the following Islands*- ABU DHABU ffHAMMl AL QASSAR SIR BU NU'AIR HALUL ZIRAKO QURNAIH DAS ARZANAH DAIYANAH SIR RANI YAS Terns and other sea birds breed in the above islands in large numbers. The number of these birds increases in winter time on account of migration from other countries. Terns also breed in other islets of Abu Dhabi f Abu Musa and Mallah of Um al Qaiwain. At present the local people do not know about this trade. It would be cheaper for Shaikh Salih Ibrahim to make a contract with a person who will supply him certain quantity for an agreed sum. If Shaikh Salih were to take concession of Guano from any particular Shaikh he may find it difficult to prevent others from taking Guano from those Islands which are not inhabited. At the same time it would be very expensive for him to have guards to prevent people col .acting Guano from them. Before making any contract Shaikh Salih would be well advised to send a representative to visit these Islands and see whether the guano found is of the quality and quantity required by him.

But on shore after deliveries were made to consignees it proved that certain marks were consigned to a consignee whose name was not known to us until afterwards when the consignee produced Bill of Lading. Further the ship’s manifest showed certain bags as containing Gram whereas on shore at the time delivery was made according to our Delivery Orders or Customs outturn it w T as proved that the very bags contained rice or flour instead of Gram. So you will observe that ships' manifests are not always correct^ also that the names of consignees are not known to us immediately the ships land cargo; the names of consignees will correctly be known to us only-when consignees produce Bill of Lading or Delivery Letters. 1 now enclose herewith a list prepared according to the Delivery Orders our Office issued and I trust this list is the correct one. 00 ^ ^ . The last item in the list namely , bags of rice were originally for Sharjah but the ship mislanded same at lubai, and as the consignee wished us to give him delivery at lubai we did so. ^ * retrun herewith the previous list as desired by your goodself.a f- i Confidential No.C/317-29/11.

I give below the figures of export of rice from Karachi to Dubai by the S.S. 'Sui Sang” during the week ending 22nd March 1941. A comparison with the figures of import given by you shows that there are s ome 200 bags of rice to be accounted for. Would you kindly check these figures and let me have a report ? S.S. 'Sui Sam?' Haji Mohamed Ali Badri 1300 Abdul Rehman 400 Jagumal Tikamdas 250 Odhandas Ooverdandas 150 Haji Zamil 350Dear K. S. Sey yed A * Razza&lt; 3* I am so sorry there has been^t a typographical mistake i» our list for the Suisang. I bow submit herewith the latest proper list of imports by this steamer and I hope similar errors will not occur again. The enclosed list is Just what has come and if there frgv be a difference of two bags this is due to shortlanding of the steamer. As regards the Ban dra we have again checked the figures and I enclose the latest proper list, I think the Mkrtakg difference of 30 bags rice is due to shutting out of cargo and nothing else. We have checked the totals of our -ists and the totals of what was actually landed and they agree.

Sometime ago a steamer named Silverlaurel arrived at Dubai with sugar shipped from Surabiya. On the same ship there were 400 bags of sugar for Sharjah, but she did not anchors at Sharjah. She went to Dubai, discharged her cargo for Dubai and went with the Sharjai cargo to Basrah and thence to Bombay where she discharged it. I was surprised about the prohibition of cargo to my country whereas it is allowed for Dubai.

Memorandum In order to enable the Transport Authorities to arrange adequate shipping space for the requirements of Bahrain, they have asked that a programme should be drawn up showing the requirements of Bahrain (including transit trade) month by month for the remaining portion of 1941. This will be alluded to as the Requirements Programme and will be sent in the form of a single statement. 2. I should therefore be most grateful if the Customs authorities here could kindly assist by letting me have material to enable me to draw up the above Requirements Programme. The details required are (a) approximate total in tons for each month beginning with July (b) the proportion of this tonnage coming from any of the following loading areas (i) North America Atlantic-Florida (ii) Gulf and West Indies (iii) South American Bast Coast. (iv) Spain, Portugal, Canaries (v) West Africa excepting Cape Town (vi) East Africa Cape Town Motobasa including Mauritius. (vii) (a) Karachi Bombay and Western India (b) Burma Calcutta East Coast &amp; Ceylon (viii) Australasia with Oceania (ix) Eastern Mediterranean Black Sea and Red Sea (x) Far East Netherlands East Indies and Singapore (xi) Pacific Coast of North and South America. (xii) British Isles. Note In indicating the source of supply please differentiate /-'&gt; p M 2 differentiate between (a) sources in which definite orders are already placed and (b) preferred sources only i.e. where orders have not definitely been placed the source in which it is intended to place the order should be given. The above tonnages will apply to general mixed cargo, details of w hich need not be given, but items having priority other than on grounds of need or political importance should be shown separately. Any exceptionally large consignments of a particular article should be accompanied by a brief explanation and justification therefor. I attach a specimen of the information required. These details for all the remaining months of the year may kindly be supplied to me as early as possible in a single statement. 3. In addition, to supplement the above programme, the Transport Authorities require to know, month by month in advance exactly what tonnage of cargo may be expected to be shipped for Bahrain. These details will include the name of the port of loading, details of the commodity, names of con signor, consignee, shipping agent, weight in tons and any other details, with sufficient indication to permit identi fication. These details are required to enable me to compile a monthly Loading Programme and shipping representatives will be instructed to load for Bahrain only cargo so specified. I should be grateful if you could kindly let me have the figures for July and August as soon as possible. The figures for September may kindly be sent to me by the end of July, for October at the end of August and so on. 4. I do not know if the Bahrain Petroleum Company have any separate arrangement for obtaining their requirements by tanker but if they have I would be grateful if your figures could also include imports by them, 5.

I beg to attach a statement giving the estimate of the annual requirements of main commoditities, including those importan for war purposes, for one year. This estimate is based on actual imports into Sharjah and Dubai by steamers and dhows. The rest of t Trucial Shaikhdoms keep no records of goods imported or exported, hence it was not possible to get an accuarte estimate. In my opinio the imports by dhows into the rest of the Trucial Sheikhdoms would a 4 about 2u per cent of the total figures of imports for Sharjah and Duoai. 3. I have arranged with the local authorities in Sharjah and Dubai to let me hc,ve a monthly statement of imports and exports of the commodities in the statement with details &amp;£ to source and destination. These statements will be for the imports and exports by sea as the local Customs keep no check on goods imjjl'ted or export/*: by land. The first statements will be sumbitted on 1st August. 4. The export by the rest of the Trucia(Coast will be about 5 per cent of the total exports by Sharjah and Dubai. 5.
