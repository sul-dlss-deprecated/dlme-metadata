Inadmissible moreover at the outset must be the claim amounting to about 35,000 lire se ting thau the enquiries made have conclusively shown that on these grounds there is no foundation for the claim* . , ■ jAf As regards the arrest of the the battle ship 'Calabi’ia” on the 3nd of February 1913, a more friend ly attitude could not have been adopted seeing that the Roy&amp;l Government consented to releaso the vessel, subject to the purchase of the cargo of flour ami rice as a friendl y arran gement* If the vessel on being released at 6 p,m* on Febru ary 2 nd did not sec fit to eont inue her voyage simply because the ^oooa light was extinguished, the loyal Government can not in any way regard itself as rsayonsiole for this delay; it is therefore obvious that nothing is due on the score of demurrage*, in any case the claim of^lUQ for a few hours voluntary delay is clearly an exaggerated one* With regard to the second arrest of the vessel on March 27th by the •Elba”, the refusal of the Captain of the 'Woodcock* to employ tho err?' in facilitating the search of a the forehold, although ooth he and the first of fleer wore in- h formed as to what would bo the consequences of the pretext put forward for their refusal, was in itself a sufficient justidlaation for Uie seiziu’e of the vessel, even if there had not been the additional oiroumstance that there were well-founded suspicions as to the nature of the cargo which she was carrying* The deficiency an! irregularities in the ship’s papers with respect to the cargo were additional reasons. account of vexatious measures or ill-treatment duringduring vmr-ti ^npecially in vi^?; of thd position ^vhore the •Woodcook* was found f for serloun suspicions as to the intentions of the vassal. Having thus shown that the captain was really and mainly responsible for the temporary seiaura of the vessel which was under the circumstances inevitable, the charge thau serious damage was done to the structure and cargo of the w trio cook w a-id that the crew and the passengeriDx* Wado wore subjected to vexatious treatment, must also be rejected on the evidence of the official reports of the doyal Author- it tos. From these reports it appears, in fact, that with regard to the damage done to the vessel the cost of the repairs executed sy the firm at Aden amounted to only-^5j that, with regard to the treatment of the crew, they were all treated with the greatest courtesy and allowed absolute liberty to go ashore, arid that, although Dr Wade carried no papers to prove his identity, a fact which might have arous ed and justified suspioion^he was treated with every con sideration anti with the regard due to a person charged with a scientific mission, and that he remained on ooard solely of his own free will, although he was allowed entire liberty to proceed to the Feresn islands, which were his destination. In spite of the conclusions thus briefly outlined the loyal Government, In order to meet the wishes of the British roverment, would not bo adverse to arriving at a compromise which would bo United to the indemnity claimed in respect of the time during which the 'Woodcock* was un avoidably prevented from engaging in her usual trade. Should the British Government be disposed in prin ciple to agree to this method of settling the case of the •Woodcock*, the Ministry of Marino suggests that the ITaval Attache the British Embassy should be authorised by Your Excellency:&gt;s Bxoollanoy to neot an offioor of thn Royal 'Tavy apeotal- ly aalootad for the purpoaa by ray aollaaffw tha .nnlator of .JarIns; tha '.’aval AttacIvS would, with this o^fibar 9mmim the nun^ous papers bearing on tha case ?;hl^h the Royal authorities have aoiiaoted and would thus be In a posit Ion uO appreciate tlie considerations which led the Ministry of Marine to adopt the oonolusIons referred to above, and the two officers would at the same tine fix the amount of the indemnity payable to the firm of vowasgle* 1 now wait to learn whether the British Oovern- neat accepts this procedure which the loyal {government has suggested mainly with the object of showing its readiness to defer to the representations made on the subject by England and the British Embassy In Rone# X have, etc*, {Signed) San diuliano•. 3078/13 ~N Decode of telegram from Sir R.Bodd (Pome) D. 20 , Jinuary, 1913.

In the name of His Majesty King Victor Emmanuel III, by the Grace of God and Will of the Nation, King of Italy. THE prize commission, composed as follows :— President... ... ... Grand Officer, Advocate Benedetto Sciliama ; Rear-Admiral Commendatore Eugenio Trifari; Commendatore the Honourable Advocate Professor Carlo Schanzer ; | Grand Officer Carlo Bruno ; Commendatore Francesco Mazzinghi; Rear-Admiral Commendatore Vittorio Cerri ; Acting Member and Reporter... Chevalier Advocate Giacomo Canetto, Regular Members c5 Acting Member Government Commissioner ... Commendatore Advocate Giuseppe Tommasi; Secretary... ... ••• Chevalier Dr. Giulio Fusignani, have pronounced the following Decision in the proceedings instituted by the aforementioned Government commissioner with a view to establishing the regularity of the detention and the lability to eonymnation the specie found on board the British steam-ship “ Thuna ’ by officers of he Ita an destroyer “ Artigliere,” when in the Red Sea near Hodeidah ; the specie in quest o consisted of 1,150 Maria Theresa thalers, and its owner is still unknown. Having heard the report of the circumstances of the case by Advocate Giacomo ^ Having heard the Government commissioner, who urged the adoption of the proposals which he had already made in writing , Hnonments The oral proceedings having been declared closed, and the pap relating to the case having been considered ; Find as follows : — Circumstances of the Case. On the 26th January, 1912, the Italian destroyer ‘‘Artigherey’ while craising m the Red Sea, visited, in latitude 14° 45' N. and longitude 45 51 E. (G^wich y steam-ship “Thuna,” a merchant-ship flying the British flag, wh ‘ c A7 h S Af at t e e r Gort from Loheia to Hodeidah; the vessel was not allowed to proceed to the latte ] , which had been included in the zone of blockade declared vo ajs ea [1345]2 The officer who carried out the visit found that the cargo manifest was missing, and also discovered a small bag containing Maria Theresa thalers, weighing 74 lb., addressed to “ A.B.” No one was able, or willing, to give any information in regard to the bag, and the officer then proceeded to detain it, drawing up a minute recording his action, which he left, as a receipt, with the captain ; the latter did not oppose the ^ detention. In due course the bag was opened on the 12th February at the post office at Massowah ; it was found to be sealed—though the impression was too indistinct to be made out—and to contain 1,150 Maria Theresa thalers, equivalent to 2,875 lire at the legal rate of exchange of 2‘50 lire per thaler ; this sum was deposited at the post office. Further enquiries were instituted, but it could only be ascertained that no reference was made to the specie in the ship ? s papers, that there was nothing to show who was the consignor or the consignee, and that the captain confined himself to asserting that he had not had time to discharge the bag at Loheia. Thereupon the Government commissioner deposited the necessary documents, and on the 29th July asked that the necessary proceedings might be instituted for establishing the regularity of the detention, and the liabdity to condemnation, of the captured specie ; on the following day the president issued an order to the effect that the notices prescribed by the regulations should be issued and that, in the absence of any means of discovering the parties presumed to be interested in the case, the institution of the proceedings should be communicated to the diplomatic representatives of Germany and England ; the order was duly carried out. Nevertheless, up to the 15th August, the date on which the preliminary proceedings were declared closed, no notice of any intention to intervene in the case came from any quarter, and no claim was lodged; nor had any such notice been received up to the 31st August, the day on which the case came up for adjudication by the commission ; in the absence of any counter-case the Government commissioner asked for the adoption of the proposals which he had submitted in writing. Legal Issues Involved. The commission first desire to observe that the Government commissioner, in petitioning for a judgment declaring the regularity of the detention, on the high seas and in time of war, of the specie found on board the steam-ship “ Thuna,” a mercbantship of neutral nationality, very rightly bases his proposals on three grave sets of considerations ; these are :— 1. The absence of any papers relating to the cargo ; 2. The unjustifiable reticence of the captain and his refusal to give any information in regard to the consignor and consignee of the bag containing the money, and ; 3. The port from which the ship was proceeding and the port for which she was bound, taken in conjunction with the special character of the article detained. Ihese circumstances are such as necessarily to give rise to suspicion in the mind of the captoi that both the place of origin and the destination of the bag of thalers was the enemy State. And, indeed, the officer of the Artighere,” when proceeding, in conformity with international usage, to visit the above-mentioned merchant-ship XI of the instructions to commanding officers of Italian war-ships, approved by Royal Decree of the 13th October, 1911), was within his rights in demanding that the captain should produce, among the other papers for establishing the nature of the goods carried by the ship, the manifest and bill of lading, or else the advice note or invoice. The conveyance of all these documents is obligatory not only on Italian but also on ritish ships [bill of lading, manifest invoices], and they are, moreover, necessary for the proper working of the contract of affreightment. The absence of such documents, as alleged by the captain, would be irregular and abnormal at any time, but it is even more so in time of war, seeing that it constitutes a violation of the duties incumbent upon neutral ships, and has the effect of curtailing the scope and utility of the right of visit exercised by belligerent ships. It must necessari y give rise to doubts as to the innocent character of goods thus unaccom panied by the proper documents—doubts so grave as regularise of themselves the act of detention carried out by the captorA further factor which must_ necessarily give rise to suspicion in the case under ^Ac^mnation, and induce the conviction that there can be no question of private innocent goods, is the reticence shown by the captain when asked to furnish an expl tion in regard to the absence of the necessary documents. Such an attitude, is tion m regard to the absence of the necessary documents. Such an attitude is only comprehensible if regaided as indicative of a deliberate intention not to disclose the real ownership of the bag of thalers. Indeed, it is the universal practice and a precept of common law to hold the captain of a ship responsible for the articles conveyed by that ship, for which he gives a receipt to the consignee and which he undertakes to convey to their destination. Thus the captain can never be ignorant of the name of the consignee, and he also normally knows the name of the person who is to receive the goods, unless the bill of lading is to order a plea which might have been, but which was not, advanced by the captain of the fhuna to explain his silence, at all events so far as the consignee was concerned. The argument may possibly be used that the reticence which, as explained above, first gave rise to suspicion was the fault of the captain of the ship, and not of the owner of the goods, who must have been more especially in a position to know and fear the danger to which his property would be subjected should the ship fall in with an Italian war-ship. To this it may be replied that the desire to conceal all circumstances liable to give an indication of the character of the goods is also discernible in the consignor, for while the latter had every interest to safeguard his rights through means offered by a contract of affreightment—especially as it was a question of the consignment of money—he nevertheless not only failed to furnish the documents usually accompanying the goods, but he attempted to conceal bv every possible means his own identity and that of the consignee ; thus the only address attached to the package consisted of two meaningless letters of the alphabet, while the seal on the bag was made in such a way that, contrary to the general custom and to every counsel of prudence, it was quite undecypherable and displayed no special impression. Yet another circumstance which is of importance in connection with this point is the fact that the captain must, in the ordinary course of his duties, have informed either the consignor or the consignee of the reason for which he was not in a position to carry out the obligation which he had assumed to deliver the package—f &gt;r it cannot be supposed that from January to the present moment there has not been time for the notice to reach the interested parties ; and in the same way, although before the opening of the present proceedings the notices prescribed by Law were duly published, no one has appeared at the secretary’s office to announce his intention to intervene in the proceedings, and no claim has been lodged in respect of the specie. To the grave evidence set forth above, which all tends to exclude the possibility of the private and innocent ownership of the specie, another factor must bo adaed. namely, that the “ Thuna” was proceeding from Loheia and was bound for Hodeidah, where metal currency is in circulation, and that she was therefore found between two ports of supply for the enemy forces and bases for the operations of those forces ; this factor mateiially supports the conviction that the specie was the property of the enemy State. , It therefore follows that the specie, though found on board a British ship, could properly be detained and should be condemned ; for, although article 2 of the Declaration of Paris lays down that goods nre covered by the neutral flag, this provision refers to goods owned by private persons, whether neutral or enemy, and cannot include property of a directly hostile nature or the property of the enemy State ; the commission, which have several times had occasion to come to a decision in this sense, have based their opinion on the spirit and historical origin and genesis of the provision in question.^ The consideration of the question from the point of view that the bag constitutes conditional contraband of war leads, after all possible theories based on the circumstances explained above have been exhausted, to the same conclusion, in view of the nature ot the captured article, consisting as it does of silver in coin. _ j xu The commission have already held, in the course of previous proceedings-—and the point is especially emphasised in a recent decision relative to com captured on t e “Menzaleh” (1st August-7th September* that Italian law recognises the form of contraband known as conditional contraband, and admits of the inclusion m t us category of gold and silver in coin when the necessary conditions are present. It will be sufficient, without repeating the arguments then used to draw attention to the fact that it was shown that, although Italian law, as expressed by article ^10 o w Itilian Mercantile Marine Code, does not refer in so many words to the classical d ^ tbn between the two classes of contraband, i.e., absolute and conditional contrabu ,4 nevertheless the wording of the concluding clause of that article_ is sufficiently wide to • Slthe 3 genesis of the two forms of contraband . the and materials which, from them lat bhf tlL natural mg to the purposes of ''. ar ’ * ' j n f^,,,f omarw law and an authoritative collection of t^ule^tefound in the Declaration ofLondonof 1909, the importance of which has more than once been recognised by this tribunal; recourse should therefore b e had to such rules in order to complete and illustrate our municipal law-and this the more so In view of the reference made to them in the preamble of the instruct,ons to commanding officers of Italian war-ships approved by the Royal decree of the 13th Octobfr 1911. From a consideration of such customary law the inference is clear that o-old and silver in coin, duly specified in article 2, &gt;,o. 4, of the Declaration of London, constitute the most important and the most urgently required o e smews of war” and should be considered, without notice, as conditional contraband of war. Acr-ain both in this case and in the earlier case to which reference _ has been made above, the second element necessary to complete the conception of conditional contraband is also present; for the destination of the bag of thalers was either Loheia, as the captain of the “ Thuna ” asserted, or else Hodeidah, the port which, in the absence of the requisite documents, would appear to be indicated by the course on which the ship was sailino- and by the kind of currency m circulation there. It is, in any case, certain that the specie was intended for a port serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy and the presumption necessarily arises that the destination of the bag was the armed forces of the enemy—a presumption imposed by international practice and specifically defined in articles 33 and 24 of the Declaration of London 1 Thus from whatever aspect the case be considered, and on whichever ot the two grounds mentioned above the decision he based, the specie is liable to condemnation ; no special order is necessary in regard to the sale, it being merely necessary to realise the value of the specie, at the legal rate of exchange, and to distribute the sum thus realised according to the relevant Italian law (article 229 of the Code of Mercantile Marine) • In the absence of any opposing party, it is also unnecessary to issue any order in regard to costs. For which reasons T’mr' PlrkArvTTaaTrkV. Having taken into consideration articles 215, 216, 225, and 229 of the Italian Mercantile Marine Code; articles 6 and 11 of the Instructions to Commanding Officers of Italian ships, approved by Royal decree of the 13th October, 1911 ; articles 16 and 18 of the regulations of the 5th December, 1911 ; _ g Declare the detention on the 26th January, 1912, of specie found on board the British steam-ship “ Thuna ” to be regular, and such specie to be good prize and liable to condemnation in favour of the Italian State, with all the legal effects pursuant thereon. No order is made in regard to costs. Thus decided by the aforementioned commission in the Council Chamber, at their offices at the Ministry of Marine (Department of Mercantile Marine), Rome, September 20, 1912. B. SCILLAMA.

The Ports prohibited in the Red Sea in consequence of the Turco-Italian War, as declared by the Italian Government, are from Khor Gulefka to Rass Fssa and n Muft eh - el ~Nh air” took cargo from Aden destined for Gizan which latter port does not locate in the blockaded zone. Certified copies of Manifest and D ort Clearance (attached for ready reference) also go to substantiate the fact that Nufteh~el-Thai^'s last port of call was registered as Gizan. We beg to submit a rough sketch showing the position of the d.how at the time of seizure and. to remark that navigation in the case of Country Crafts are solely depend on breeze. Bearing this in mind it is next to impossible for such vessels to sneak away with an evil intention from their course and. immediate^ resume the same on meeting danger when out of proper course. What we try to express is that the 'Mzfteh- el~Khair' was strict In en route to Cizan 'without •O' straying in the way as can be seen from the rough sketch. Such being the case it is not unde-rstood. hoio % the Commander of the Italian men-of~war happen to predict that the dhoio was in the restricted- area when he was roughly 15 miles off the spot himself. StatementStatement showing the names of the consignees of cargo (residents of Gizan) and description and value of goods which the dhow carried, is also attached. m e farther beg to state that the shippers of these cargo are well known merchants and landlords of Aden and the total trade turn up yearly by each of them would amount to no less than from 1 to 2 lakhs of rupees. In conclusion we pray that you will be good enough to favourably consider our cade and tc take such action as you may deem, fit for the restoration Oj cur ahow which is the only^mefyas of our subsistence for which we shall ever remain grateful to yon.

Besides there are many dhows that sail under Arabic Coli 1 rs. The fact that when 'Yousar' 'Ihifteh-el-Khair' and one other vessel named 'Amanat-el-Karim,' which was also caught, were overhauled at Massawah and the flags of these dhows collected together they found some Engl i shEnglish flags amongst them mhini 77 ^ V ten which were also added to t^.is collection* m„ f ( .

She was lawfully captured because she had no reason to go into the blockaded zone. The cargo must await the decision of the Prize Court; the owners must prove before this tribunal that when they were loading the dhow, they did not know that she was going to a blockaded port.

If Abooker Mossa wishes to represent his case to Government, he is requested to submit a properly written petition explaining clearly his views of the case and attaching duly certified copies of the Port Clearance, manifest, &amp;c., and a statement showing the names of the consignees of cargo and des* cription and value of the goods which the dhows carried.

E rom Saiyid Ahmed-bin-Taha Safi, and others, Merchants and British subjects in Aden, To—The Political Resident, Aden. 'We, merchants in Aden and British subjects, state that the native craft called “Fateh-el-Salambelonging to Messrs. Bakar and Abdul Kader Bashrahil, agents of the Sultan of Mokalla, and managed by a Nakhoda named Shaikh Salim Awad-ba-Abbad recently left Aden loaded with our merchandise for Midi, and on her arrival in Midi she discharged all the caro-o in Midi. She was then loaded with goods in Midi for Aden and one day’, after her departure from Midi, she was seized during the^ voyage together with her cargo, valued at Rs. 25,000, by an Italian battleship. The Italian battleship took the said vessel to Massawa, the Nakhoda of the said vessel exhibited to the Captain of the man-of-war, the authority certificate which was given by your Court for the said native craft but the Captain had no regard to it and only asked for a certificate issued by Saiyid Idrisi. Midi and Gezan, as you might he aware, are not under blockade and the shipping to and exporting from Midi and Gezan have never been objected by the Italian Gov ernment, either direct or vid Massawa. Under these circumstances, the seizure of the said vessel and her cargo is quite illegal and detrimental to the trade. The Nakhoda and crew of the said vessel arrived to-day from Massawa and told us that they were dispossessed of the vessel and the cargo and expelled to Aden. We, therefore, implore Your Honour to take immediate steps and telegraph the Massawa authorities to keep the vessel and the cargo under strict safety and preservation without being meddled with pending submission to Your Honour of our complaint and of its disposal, for we are afraid, in the meantime the Italian authorities might perhaps devastate and undersell by auction our property. Moreover as there are now other vesseR carrying oui goods to and from Gezan and Midi, we are apprehensive the Italian battleships might interfere with and seize the said vessels with their cargo, hence the great difficulty and mortification; and we pray Your Honour will take steps to protect us against seizure of the said vessels and cargo being British loyal subjects.2 If the said Nakhoda and crow should necessarily stay in Aden for being examined by Your Honour, we would request you to detain them because they are to go to*Mokalla to-morrow : we have been compelled to send our complaint by wire for the reason that the said crew will leave Aden to-morrow and for which we beg to apologize.

I have the honour to forward, for your information, copy of a telegram I have received from certain merchants in Aden informing me that a native vessel, called “ Hateh-el-Salam, ” belonging to Messrs. Bakar and Abdul Kader Bashrahil, and managed by Nakhoda Shaikh Salem Awad-ba-Abbad, has been seized by the Italian warships and taken to Massawa, although she was not apparently bound for any of the blockaded ports. I shall be obliged if you will kindly use your good offices to get her released at once and at the same time would ask to be informed of the circumstances under which she was seized. No. 6H, dated Aden, the 9th July 1912. From—L. Zunini, Consul-General for Italy, Aden, To— Major H. F. Jacob, Acting Political Resident, Aden. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your two letters, respectively dated the 6th July, No. 2073, and 9th instant, No. 2095, regarding seizure by Italian cruisers of dhows belonging to British subjects. ° I will write by the next mail to the Commander of the Naval Station at Massawa and as soon as I will receive an answer I will communicate the same to yon. Statement of Shaikh Salem, Nakhoda of dhow “ Fateh-el-Salam”. Shaikh Salem, son of Ba Abbad ; caste Mussalman, Arab ; age 40 years; occupation Nakhoda; residence Mokalla. I am Nakhoda of buggalow “Fateh-el-Salam”. I was coming with mv buggalow from Midi to Aden. I left Midi Saturday before last. I was carrying general cargo, such as coffee, hides, juari and til-seed and empty gunny bags. When we came near the island of Himar on the following dav, i.e., Sunday, we saw a gun-boat.^ It was Italian, and they fired at us. When we saw this, we lowered our sail and went towards the mamof-war. A cutter with naval men in it approached our buggalow. They came in and searched the buggalow. I was then taken to the man-of-war in the cutter and some of the blue-jackets remained in my buggalow. The Commander of the ship asked me whence I came, and I told him that I came from the port of Midi. He then asked for papers from the Idrisi, and I told him I had none, but I showed him all the papers I had from Aden and the Sultan of Mokalla. The Commander then told me that he had orders to take the Nakhoda to Massawa who did not produce papers from the Idrisi of Midi. The Commander then gave me a chit and ordered me to go in my bungalow to Kamran and to hand over the chit to the Commander of the man-of-war stationed there, and if I failed, he said, he was following me and would sink my dhow. I then went to Kamran the same day and reached there at sunset, and handed oa er to the Captain of the man-of-war the chit of the Commander and all the buggalow papers that I had. The Commander of the man-of-war oideied me to be t^iicn to Massawa with my buggalow. I protested and told him to detain my buggalow and crew and to allow me to go to Midi to procure a certificate from the Idrisi through my Agents. The Commander refused to let me go. Me \\ ere detained in Kamran for five days. The man-of-war people there removed 33 bags of coffee and 48 bags of til-seed from my buggalow to the man-of-war. We were then towed to Massawa. The coffee and til-seed hags which were removed from my buggalow were again put back into mybuggalow at Massawa. Then the buggalow was taken to the shore. On our going near the shore a policeman came and took note of the number of crew and the cargo and after four days I and all my crew, in all 22 men, were taken ashore, and the policeman told us to go away and that the dhow and cargo was taken over by the Italian Government. I then told the policeman to take me to some responsible officer so that I may request him to let me have the juari which is on hoard the dhow for the maintenance of the crew. He took me to an Italian officer, and I made my request to him, but he refused. We remained in Massawa for three days, and then I went to the Commander of the warship who had taken us to Massavva and requested him to send us back to Aden, as we did not know anybody at Massawa. He gave his two men with me who took me to an Italian officer on shore, and we were shipped back to Aden by an Italian ship. We were in Massawa for about a week. I sailed from Aden in my buggalow for Midi last month and was returniug to Aden when we were captured by the Italian warship. Before me. Aden ; ^ J. B.

Dated Aden, the 11th July 1912, From— Saiyid Ahmed-bin-Taha Safi, and others, Merchants and British subjects in Aden, To—M ajor H. F. Jacob, Acting Political Resident, Aden. In continuation to our telegram of the 8th July 1912, in connection with the seizure of the dhow “ Eateh-el-Salam ” and its cargo by the Italian man- of-war on its way from Midi to Aden, we, the undersigned, beg to approach your honour with our arguments and contentions which we trust will meet with your favourable consideration. 1. That the cargo loaded in the said dhow consisted of coffe, skins, sesame, corn and similar goods which are not in the shape of smuggled property or intended to interfere with the hostilities between the Turks and the Italians. 2. That the port of Midi is not under blockade restrictions and ever since the war broke out the Italian Government have of their own free will allowed the trade with Midi and Gezan. During the said war the merchan dise have been uninterruptedly exported from Aden to Midi and vice versd without any prohibition having been imposed by the Italian Government. On many occasions Italian warships chanced to meet dhows carrying goods between Aden and Midi, but they never interrupted or interfered with them in4 the Red Sea. Apart from this, almost all the goods have been shipped from Aden to Midi and vice with transhipment at Massawa by Italian steamers without the least objection by the Italian Government. The Italian Govern ment will no doubt admit that she has not as yet issued any proclamation whatever notifying the blockade of the aforesaid places. 3. That under these circumstances your honour will surely asrree with us that the seizure of the dhow and its cargo was quite erroneous and illegal. 4. That as the said dhow is under the protection of the Great British Government and as both she and her cargo belong to British subjects, the Nakhoda tendered to the Captain of the warship which captured the dhow the certificate granted by the Great British Government, but the Captain took the certificate and without regard retained it with him. He simply asked for a certificate signed by the Syed Idrisi. As it has not hitherto been the practice that dhows should be provided with certificate from Syed Idrisi, the said Nakhoda did not ask for such a certificate when he left Midi, knowing that the British Government’s certificate is quite sufficient authority to protect the dhow with its cargo against seizure. 5. That as Your Honour will see, it was no legal reason for the Italian Government to seize dhows and their cargo in the absence of production of certificates from Syed Idrisi. Nevertheless the Nakhoda could have returned to Midi and easily obtained a certificate from Syed Idrisi, but unfortunately the Captain of the warship did not at all take the statement of the Nakhoda and simply in an abrupt manner seized the dhow and led it directly to Massawah without regard and due deliberation. 6. That on the arrival of the warship in Massawa she handed the dhow to the authorities there and without taking any statement from neither tl e Nakhoda nor the crew they simply dispossessed them of the dhow and its cargo and expelled them to Aden in spite of their having been in very distressed circumstances on account of their starvation and dejection of life. Such an action practised by the Italian Government is an unprecedented event. B -f 7 ;. r. We have &gt; the f e . fo re. been compelled to submit our complaint to the British Government which are our sole protege and who afford us refuge and shelter and earnestly hope that they will kindly direct their attention to the risks to which our people and our properties are being subiected to and Trith the 6 ewentin °j ou r dhow and property is no less than fts.25,000 with the exception of the other dhows and their cargo which have recentlv sailed from Aden to Midi and Gezan and vice versa which are now under the risk of being illegally seized.

On March the 27th 1912 the S.S,'Woodcock* was hoarded by a search party from the Italian war ship 'Elba' and the officer in charge of the party ordered me to tell my crew to hoist up on deck some 1300 packages which composed the Woodcocks^ cargo. Had I complied my vessel would have probably eapsized^on my refusal we were escorted to Massawa, and there kept close prisoners on board for 5 days after which we were allowed on shore, being detained in all for 15 days during which time we were allowed to communicate to no one, the only food procurable ashore was inferior and expensive 5 the extra expense fell on me personally and in addition my health has suffered, and I havehav® been under medical treatment for 20 days since my return from Massawa. I acted as I did for the safety of the vessel in my charge andhave yet to learn that the rales of civilised Maritime warfare justify a belligerent search party in expecting the crew of a neutral vessel to assist it in its search or in penalising them by detention of the Vessel, When for urgent and vital reason such demands are not complied with.

I request that Your Excellency will infora the Italian linister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's Government highly appreciate the consideration evinced by the Italian Government in the instructions which have been sent, and trust that it will be reflected by the action of their naval authorities.

I ji&amp;id I Jmd observed in England a growing sense of impatience at the uncertain* x-' ties and risks which this action hadfentailed on the, to us / all important shipping interest, and expressed uhe hope tiiat the Italian Eoverixient^ to whose advantage it could not be to arouse a sense of irritation in Eng- ^vVland^ would give tMs natter their serious conciderati on to which we were the more entitled as we had throughout shown a disposition to make every reasonable jfllowance •o Right Eon. r Grey Bart.,h.G.,2:.p., c etc etc f orfor the exigencies of belligerents. The Marquis de Gan Ciuliano received ny observations in a friendly manner and promised to give then his best attention, j;e adnitt^&lt;^- that they were theaselves sometimes misled by reports which had every appearance of being well-founded, but Ids only defence for the rigorous prosecutilb by the Ita- Viewy lian^of searches which Jiad led to so little result was the contention that it was precisely this constant vigi lance which prevented ships from engaging in the contra band trade. As we had such a preponderance of shipping it was unfortunately our ships which were most in evi dence. This conversation has had its practical result and I have just received a communication from His Excellency marked confidential^copy and translation of which is forwarded herewith, in which he informs me that in giving general instructions as regards the Red Sea the Linister of Karine has added a special clause en joining on Italian Uaval Officers particular regard for British navigation, and ordering them to tre&amp;t the Bri tish flag with the greatest possible consideration com- I patible with the exigencies of war. ?he Italian Govern-\o%j nent^it is added^feel^ confident that His hajesty^ Govern:, ment will take the necessary steps with their agents and and especially with the authorities at Aden to ensure xious that other Governments should not have knowledge t British shipping.

I have satisfied myself that so far as the question of the advocate Senator JALore is concerned, both the Minis ter for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Tinister knew nothing of the pressure which his colleagues in the Senate brought to bear on him to make him abandon his brief. They both of them realised what an unfortu nate impression such an attitude would create and took immediate steps to place the matter in its proper light^ \ with the result that Senator Fiore at once consented to that sue ill not be abused for the advan tage of the Turkish forces. The Italian Government are, I gather, an that exceptional treatment has been &amp; for the case of the^ Bensaleh' now before the Prise Tribunal act as he rrid originally undertaken lo do. As regardsthe posttxjnofnento asked for in oi’der to give more time lor the production of documents^ there has been, since the Tribunal was instituted, a constant struggle bet ween the rinistry for Foreign Affairs and the Prise Tribunal, which apparently is very tenacious in uphol ding its judicial independence* But I have every reason to believe that the inistry has loyally supported our applications in this respect, and the desired result has generally so far been attained, though considerable use of the telegraph has been rendered necessary. It would be desirable that shipping companies should, in antici- ■apt!on of the formal notifications issued by the Prize Court, lose no time after a question has arisen which is likely to go before tHSfcfcTribunal^ in collecting and pre paring evidence to support their case. In view of the instructions which have now been given to the Italian Pav^L Author!ties with regard to the treatment of British shipping in the Red Sea I have replied to your telegram ho.29 Treaty of the 27th. i j ulrtino that I do not propose to act on the instructions therein contained until you have taken cognisance of hi j 1 op rii.fr oh. ■ -t q— 1 »q.w« -h'r %THAN SLAT 1015 1 Confidential note Verbal e ^ U+ IffT- .

They justify the seizure of the case of dollars on the ground that it was not mentioned on the way bill and was addressed to. n Lohcia at which place it had not been landed, adding that the matter will be Prize Court. before the The Right Hon: They ir E* Grey Bart., K.G., M.P.I They admit that the refusal of the Coriander of the Italian squadron to allow the 'Hoharamedi' to embark her cargo v/as due to his having misinterpreted his instructions but contend that ample amends were made by his subsequent action in permitting three vessels to break the blockade in order to enbark the cargo which the n hchamr/]ed$|!‘ had been prevented from taking and all other cargo which neutral subjects wished to despatch* In reply to the contention that British interests received less favourable treatment than those of other Powers they point to the fact fcapqt of the three vessels thus allowed to break the blockade two were British* I have the honour to be with the highest respect, your most obedient humble servantTranslation* i \ iim !Q|9 I U w' 1- i ^ * U -J Kinistry of Foreign Affairs* Hocie, June 20. 1912. In a meraorandun dated the 15th of April last, the British Embassy called the attention of the Koyal Government to certain incidents which were alleged to have occurred in the Red Sea as the result of the blockade established afcng the c^aost of the which would • according^tOe the views of the British Government - tend to shew that an equally favourable treatment had not been extended to British interests as to those of the subjects of other nations. ^he explanations which the Commandant of the Royal Bava! forces In the Red Sea was requested to furnish area***) OK VklL-Sufrylot' reached the Royal I inistry of Marine at|the end of last month and the finis try of Foreign Affairs has accordingly the honour to make the following communication to the British Embassy; As is shewn in Die Remo; referred to, the i^ritiah S ’ S * l, -t una * not at Hodeidah at the moment when the blockade was established, having gone to Loheia to unlaad and load cargo. She returned from Loheia bound for Hod- eidah at a time when the blockade was already established and was, accordingly , not allowed to enterfthe blockaded area* It was at this time that the right of search was exercisedexercised in the case of the 'Tuna* and that a case of dollars was seized which did not appear on the Irill of ladin£ and was addressed to 'A # B. 51 Loheia, r/here it had not been disembarked* The seizure of this sum of none/ was effect^in accord ance with the prescribed regulations and the papers bear ing on the case will be communicated by the Royal Ministry of Marine to the Prize Court* It docs not seem, moreover, that there can be any ques* tion as to the propriety of the refusal to allow the Tuna to break the blockade* In fact, Loheiaiwas not at the time within the blockaded area, being fully 40 miles from Has Isa which was then the Northern limit of the blockade area. The fact tliat the Tuna did not finish at iiodeidah the discharge of the goods consigned to that port, is not sufficient to justify the contention Uiat although the vessel was in fact engaged in commercial operations at Loheia, a port at such a considerable ist&amp;nce from the bloclcadti area, she had not in reality left the port of Hodeidah and consequently had a right to the five days grace allowed to vessels which were really within the blockaded area* At the moment when the blockade was established, the Tuna was already outside the zone referred to, and to have allowed her to re-enter it would have amounted to a special favour which might have been asked for by all other neutral vessels. The refusal to allow the S.3. i ohamedi to load goods during the period of five days grace was the result of an erroneous interpretation of his instructions by the Senior naval officer of the blockading squadron; viz. to allow vessels2. vessels within the blockaded zone to complete loading oper ations; this permission he interpreted in a restrictive sense as though it referred only to the completion of loadi ing operations already begun; a condition which was not fulfilled in the case of the llohamedi, which had not at the time even finished the operation of discharging cargo* But it should be added that as soon as the Commandant of the Royal vessels was informed of the complaint he took steps to meet it by allowing other vessels to enter the blockaded zone to take not only the goods which had not 4\&gt; 11 been shipped on the Moha mmedi, but also any other merchan dize which neutral subjects might desire to despatch* Two requests were made to him in this connexion; one by the Royal Consul at Aden on behalf of firms of different nationalities and th&lt; other by the political resident at Aden solely on behalf of British subjects* In compliance with the first of these requests the vessel 1 Turja and in coo* ** •&lt;’ plianco with the second the vessel Woodcock was allowed to p pass* The latter, eventually, for reasons unknown to the Italian Commandant, did not make use of the permission gran ted. In accordance with instructions sent by the Royal Govern ment the French S.S/ Anaand Behi c' was also allowed to enter . odeidah for the same purpose. From the above it is seen; 1. that the inconvenience caused the refusal return ed to the request of the T'ohnmcdi 'was at once repaired by a allowing three other vessels to enter the harbour.* 2, that no differential treatment prejudicial to British interests was shewn, seeing that two of the&amp;e vessels flew the British flag; 3. that moreover the concession cade at the instance of the political Resident at Aden was exclusively in the inter# e&amp;tufc of British subjects and British Goods. j j^ Ji immtyz c : v*, : • ✓ No. 3656, dated Bombay Castle, the 29th Aptil (received 2nd May) 1912.

It seems probable that the Italians intend to blockade Salif, though nothing of it is known officially. 4. I am at a loss to understand the statements of Messrs. Cowasji Dinsbaw and Brothers in this matter. The information given by them about the mails is inconsistent as will be seen from my letter to them of the 5th instant. But whatever may be the truth as regards this matter of mails, I would urge that representations be made to the Italian Government to release the ship without delay. Dated Aden, the 31st March 1912.

I have received a message this morning from Massowah to say my steamer “ Woodcock ” is arrested by the Italians and taken to Massowah. She left Aden on 24th instant for Camaran, Salif and Parsan, had one Englishman for Earsan and three Erench Engineers for Salif. She had general cargo for Salif, consist ing of flour, American piece goods, sugar, gum, spices, etc. There was on board one Persian Consul’s son for Hodeidab who had with him Hs. 4,900 for his own personal use. She had five Parsee fitters, two Indians for Salif Salt Works, four Arabs, two Persians, two Somalies. I shall send you copies of manifest later on. I suggest your wiring, if you consider it well, to the Commander of Massowah, asking for the reason of arrest. Sorry to disturb your Sabbath, but the matter being of importance I thought necessary to write and inform you at once. I may add she had on board a mail bag for British Consul, Hodeida, and I trust the Italians will not temper it. No. 36, dated Aden, the 3rd April 1912. From Messrs.

With reference to your letters of yesterday and to-day, I have the honour to inform you that the Commander, Italian Naval Forces, Massowah, tele graphs that the “ Woodcock ” was captured after leaving Salif in the direction of Farsan. He adds that the Master did not inform him that he was carrying mails which have since been forwarded to Hodeidah by torpedo boat. He concludes by saying that the reasons for the capture of the u Woodcock ” have been reported to the Italian Government. The Bombay Government have been informed of the capture by wire but until the circumstances of, and reasons for, the capture are known, it is obviously impossible to say whether it is justified or not. Whether it was or not the Master, Captain Johnson, cannot be excused for his action in concealing the fact that he was carrying mails. 2.

It will now he necessary to inform Government that the firm have misled us as to S.S. “ Woodcock ” carrying mails ; and if they have misled the authorities in that important matter, it is open to any body to suppose that they may have equally misled them in other matters of equal importance.Dated Aden/the 5th April 1912. p rom —M essrs. Cowasji Dinshaw and Brothers, Aden, To —Major J. K. Condon, Acting Political Resident, Aden, r , ' ,• - Seizure of S. S.''* Woodcock”. In Continuation of our letter of yesterday, we cannot understand why there should be such a delay in the decision of the Italian Government, whether the “ Woodcock ” was rightly or wrongly captured and to declare the reasons for same. f The whole of a British ship with crew is in custody of the Italians for a whole Week and it is time the British Government urged immediate release of the steamer. There is on board an English gentleman, Dr. Wade, who has chartered the steamer to carry him to Earsan and back and he is also practically a prisoner in the Italians’hands. The S. S. Woodcock ” was captured on her way to Farsan after discharg ing part cargo at Salif, she was practically far away from the blockade zone and we do not understand what right the Italians had in capturing her in that part of the Red Sea. She had no mails on board for the Turks. What she had was very small packet for the British Consul and it is very probable the Captain did not consider the small packet as mail, anyhow that cannot be a reason for the steamer’s arrest. Each time the steamer left for Salif the Italian Consul was informed and the steamer’s manifest was sent to the Italian Consul for his inspection. Every thing was done so as not to cause any suspicion about the steamer’s movement and what she was carrying. We beg to suggest to urge once again the Commander of the Italian Naval Forces at-Massowah ( to get the steamer released without further delay. We are engaging cargo for Salif per S. S. “ Africa ” in absence of your having any information of thejblockade at Salif. It is necessary for the interest of the British trade that such information be given to the Folitical Resident by the Italian authorities so as not to cause any misunderstanding.Telsgn Tr+m - The Secretary to tho GoTerament of Boiabay, Political repartmsnt, To - The Htcretary to the GrOTermr.aat ©f India ip the foreign T&gt;epartmenx, Simla* Ho. 4-M.

No articles of a contra-band nature having been found on board, orders were given for the release of the vessel and for the purchase of the foodstuffs on board as had been done in the case of those seized on the occasion of the former capture. The owner of the vessel was informed through the Royal Consul at Aden of this action, and he appeared to be satisfied. In accordance with the wish expressed in the memorandum of the British Embassy of the 6th instant. fresh149 OSk) fresh instructions have been issued to the Cornraandant of the Royal ships in the Red Sea to the effect that, foodstuffs not being included in our list of contraband, they should be exempt from seizure, except in the case of blockade-running and, of course, with reservation of the right to ascertain whether the vessel has not been guilty in other respects of contraband traffic or of rendering assistance to the enemy.and address— The Under-Secretary of State, ( j n any further communication on this subject, please quote UUh i- -i - No . 15287/12.

I have received Your Excellency’s despatch No.28 of this Series of the 11th ultimo, reporting further v/ith regard to the seizure hy the Italian Naval Authori ties of certain parcels of rice and flour from the British Steamship 'Woodcock”. In view of the fact that the case has been re ferred to the decision of a Prize Court, His kajesty’s Government will not press for the immediate release of this cargo pending the decision of that Tribunal. Youi Excellency should, hov/ever, clearly explain to the Italian Government that His Majesty’s Government expect that the Prize Court will adjudicate upon the matter with the shortest possible delay, and that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, they are unable to contemplate any other result as possible than that the Tribunal should release the goods and order the, payment of liberal compensation for their seizure. You 8 Excellency The Right Honourable Sir R.Rodd, G.C.V.O., K.C.M.G.,You should again impress upon the Italian Government that His Majesty's Governnent, relying upon the official notification issued by them in October last and their subsequent explicit assurance that foodstuffs whatever their destination, would not be deemed to be contraband of war,,issued a public notification to this effect for the benefit of British Shipowners and merchants con cerned. On the faith of this assurance cargoes have been and are being freely shipped to Turkish non- blockaded ports. The attitude now adopted by the Italian Ministry of Marine, appears to His Majesty’s Government irreconcilable with the pledge given to Your Excellency by the Italian Government a view which I gather from your despatch^ is shared by the Italian Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Majesty's Government do not for a moment be lieve that the Italian Government have any intention of departing without, due notice from the policy they have formally enunciated. But in view of the action of the Commander of the 'Calabria', and of the reference by the Italian Naval Commander in the Red Sea to the unloading ofof a cargo of grain at Hodeldah to which Your Excellency alluded in your despatch No.17 Treaty of the 14th ultimo, it appears essential that renewed and explicit orders should he given to the Italian Naval Commanders to re frain from interference with innocent neutral vessels carrying cargoes, such as coal and foodstuffs, which the Italian Government have decided should not he treated as contraband. If any douht were allowed to arise as to that decision being upheld and duly carried out in practice, an embarrassing position would be created both for the British and for the Italian Governments. For it would then become necessary for His Majesty’s Government to supplement the notification which they made to British traders on the strength of Italian official statements, by a further announcement to the effect that the Italian Government had failed to carry out the original notification and that captures were being made in dis regard of the terms of their official declaration. Your Excellency should accordingly ask for the prompt issue of such fresh instructions. I am Me., (For the Secretary of State) Eyre A*Crowe. (Signed)CONFIDENTIAL. Sir Edward Grey to Sir ~R.

You should also act on that portion of my despatch No. 31, Treaty, directing you to request that Italian naval officers be enjoined not to interfere with British vessels carrying coal or food-stuffs or other non-contraband articles to non-blockaded ports. As regards the compensation, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople is being instructed to communicate with merchants, owners of confiscated cargo, with a view to claim being formidated.

WITH reference to my telegram in this series No. 14 of yesterdays date, I have the honour to transmit herewith translation of the reply of the Italian Govern ment to the note which I have addressed to them on the subject of pilgrim ships going to or leaving the Hedjaz. I have, &amp;c. R. RODD. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. The Marquis di San Giuliano to Sir R. Rodd. Sir, Rome, March 4, 1912. I DID not fail to communicate to the Ministry of Marine the contents of your Excellency’s note of the 9th February, relative to the request of the British naval authorities that every consideration, which is consistent with the necessities of war, may be shown to pilgrim ships proceeding to the Hedjaz. His Excellency the Minister of Marine points out in reply that there might perhaps be a misunderstanding as to the period at which the pilgrimages of Mussulmans to their holy places usually take place ; indeed, according to the prescriptions of the Koran (chapter 2, verses 192 and 193) they should take place in the months of Chewal, Dhoul Kadeh and Dhoul Hidjieh of the Mussulman year, which in 1912, corresponds to year 133 of the Hejira, so that these months correspond to October, November, and December of the current year. From information received from the naval commander at Massowah, of whose telegram a copy is enclosed, it appears that the pilgrimages take place at a peiiod still fairly remote, and it would therefore seem premature at present to lay down regulations about the treatment to be accorded to pilgrim ships. . . , Should the war still be continuing at that time, the British Governments request will be taken into consideration as far as is permitted by the exigencies of warlike operations by sea and land. ^ . There remains then to be considered the limited traffic of pilgrims who proceed, especially from Suakin, to Jeddah and thence to Mecca, without being specially bound to prescribed periods, and who are of more particular interest to the British ag un er which they are usually transported. The Royal Minister of Marine will take steps to instruct commander Cerrma to put no obstacles in the way of this traffic, especially in the case of the outward voyage, provided there are no grounds for suspecting contraband or any ot ei ac ion arm u o our interests. But in regard to the return voyage his Excellency maintains the most ample reserves respecting our absolute right ot search in the broa es , sense o e eim, in order to prevent Turkish and Arab contingents disguised as pilgrims, from mixing with the returning pilgrims with the intention of gaining the ot ei s 0 e ; e Sea and thence proceeding by land in order to join the combatants in Gyrenaica fighting against the Italian troops. 11 xi, u m tt- In bringing the above to your Excellency’s knowledge, I may add, that should His Majesty’s Government see fit to give instructions to the Suakin authorities to combat the above-mentioned danger, namely, the passage of contmgen s es me 01 e . sea of war, it would be of mutual advantage, for the necessity ot visit by Italian ships would be diminished and the movements of pilgrims would be more tree. When your Excellency shall have been pleased to lay this suggestion before [2403 1] 2,7^ yr2 • tit ^ i , 7 ., n would inform me in due course His Majesty’s Government, I should be grateful .1 you would how it has been received.

Sir, I am directed by the Council of the All-Iudia Muslim xoagH.® to request you to bring to the notice of the imperial Government the feelings of alarm and resentment entertained ty the Muslims of India regarding the blockade and bombardment of HOdeida, Mooha and other Arabian ports on the Bed Sea, which Italy intends to extend to jedda and Yenibo, the entrances to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, respectively, whan the pilgrimage season comes to a close. Muslim apprehensions regarding the blockade are not merely sentimental, but substantial as well. Indian traders of Bombay and Aden not only Musalmans but Hindus and parsis too, maintain a brisk traffic with jedde. and the Yemte ports already referred to, and the number of our countrymen who have settled in these places is not snail. Beoent reports confirm this belief, as a couple of boats belonging to Messrs. Diushaw of Aden were seized by the Italians'IX\ Italians, and if nothing is done to protect the Indian traders, their losses would Indeed be serious. The loss to trade is merely one aspect of the question. The veneration in which Mecca and Medina are held by Muslims all over the world cannot be too much exaggerated, and communication between the two places and the rest of the Islamic world does not cease with the end ttf the pilgrimage season. if Italy were to succeed in an effective blockade of the ports leading to these places, and thus prevent all communication with other countries, the resentment caused among Muslims ?rould be very great. The council of the League believes tnat the course of harassing Turkey which Italy has adopted is fraught with grave danger, as it will be regarded as a violation of tneir Holy Land by Muslim communities of the last and will produce among them a commotion which has never been seen before; and would therefore respectfully request that British Government to persuade Italy to desist from wantonly wounding the feelings of His Majesty’s /I Muslim subjects by causing a blockade of jedda and Yembo wnich lead to Mecca and Medina, confine their operations to other ports.

At 3 a.m. on the 25th January sailed for Loheiya with part cargo for Hodeidah still on board. Arrived at Loheiya at 5 p.m. on the 25th and commenced discharging at 7 a.m. of 26th January. Eeceived orders by telegram from your agents in Hodeidah to proceed there at once. Left for Hodeidah at 2 p.m. of 26th January, having still on board one bag specie marked A B for Loheiya. At 7-30 p.m. were stopped by Italian destroyer Artillerie off Hodeidah and ordered to follow her to an anchorage. At 8 p.m. anchored and was boarded by officer from the Artillerie who searched the ship and took with him one bag specie for Loheiya marked A B. I asked permission to remain till morning and com municate with Agent or the British Consul and was told I could not have any communication with the shore whatever. At 7 a.m. on the 27th were boarded again by an officer from Italian cruiser Puglia who mustered all hands and again searched the ship and ordered me to leave the port at once. The original manifest of the Hodeidah cargo was delivered to our agents at Hodeidah on my arrival there on the 24th January and the manifest for Loheiya delivered to the agents at Loheiya on 26th January. I informed the Italian officer who first boarded the Tuna that if I was permitted to communicate with my agents or the British Consul I could produce the original manifest which was taken ashore. The specie for Loheiya was not delivered as the consignee did not turn up to take delivery. I left Hodeidah at 10 a.m. on the 27th January having part cargo for Hodeidah still on board.

I Blockade of Hodeidah. I hEiv-e fte honour to forward berewith for your kind attention a letter winch has just been handed me and which has been signed by a cumber of Aden merchants who have large interests at stake at Hodeidaln3 . Their complaint is that no notice has been given to the British subiects residing at Hodeidah that the port was to be blocked, and that the blockade was instituted before they had any possible chance of leaving, all vessels on which they might have escaped to safety being prevented from entering the port; and as a result they are now forced to remain at Hodeidah with but a ^ scanty supply of food and not having been able to make any provision for the preservation of their lives and merchandise. I therefore have the honour to request on their behalf that you will be so good as to endeavour if possible to arrange some means immediately to enable foodstuffs to be sent to Hodeidah for British subjects and also to allow of the persons concerned removing themselves and their goods to a place of safety. In support of the statement that no vessels were available for transport of British subjects from Hodeidah, I have the honour to attach herewith the state ment of the Master of S.S. Tuna which was turned away from the port by the Italian warship. The Secretary, Chamber of Commerce, Aden. Sir, Aden, 29th January 1912. \ We beg to inform you that it is the rule that Powers at war always give timely notice to subjects of neutral Powers that a blockade is to be made or that a town is to be bombarded, and that neutral subjects are warned to clear out or remove their goods and protect same, but in the case of the Hodeidah blockade no notice was given to the British subjects at Hodeidah, who have hundreds of thousands of rupees invested in goods and credit at Hodeidah which is now in jeopardy on account of the Italian Government not giving any notice of the blockade which was made on the 25th of January. Besides this, Eritish subjects are now in Hodeidah without a sufficient quantity of food. We therefore beg that you will be so good as to make an urgent representa tion to the authorities concerned to permit foodstuffs to be sent to Hodeidah for British subjects, who will otherwise be stranded in a blockaded port, and that British subjects be allowed to remove their goods to a place of safety.

As regards the present situation I would point out what is probably already known to the Chamber of Commerce, i.e., that the Political Resident here is powerless effectively to intervene: and, except to a certain limited extent, the role of the Bombay^Government is presumably limited to making representations to the Government of India. As far as Hodeidah is concerned, the British Consul at that place is the only local authority whose power of active interference amounts to anything. In conclusion I would add that the above remarks are mere explanatory of the circumstances and of the position of the Political Resident, whose fullest sympathy is with those who are by the exigencies of this war put to suffering, inconveniences or loss and who desires to identify himself with the interests of the community of which he is the official head.

We beg to suggest that a telesram be sent to the Home Office informing them that the absence of sufficient notice to British subjects to clear out with their goods has placed them in an awkward position and they are likely to suffer from want of food and they run the risk of being subjected to the fury of the Turkish soldiers who will commandeer any foodstuff that may be available in Hodeidah; besides this, they and all foreign subjects are likely to be ill-treated or molested.

Further to my letter to the Political Resident of yesterday, I have the honour to draw your attention to the fact that up to the present most of the British subjects at Hodeidah have been depending upon condensed water brought from Aden for drinking purposes. This supply is of course now stopped, and there is now left for consumption only the well water of Hodeidah- 5 which it is feared must have suffered pollution on account of the cholera obtain ing in the district, and in this case the position of British residents there will be far worse than anticipated. I shall be glad to know if anything can be done to relieve the situation so that I can inform and allay the great anxiety of the Aden merchants who have their houses and relatives at Hodeidah.

I most humbly and respectfully beg to bring to your kind notice that I shipped (1) Surra species content dollars 1,150 at Rs. 1,600 in S.S. Tuna for Loheiya. The steamer reached the port, but the consignees have no time to take the delivery on account the steamer was hurry to sail off, the steamer left Loheiya for Aden and the species were returning to Aden. The Italian man-of- war caught her m the sea and inspect the steamer manifest found the surra and took away.

In submitting this Resolution to the Secretary of State at the special request of the organisers of the Meeting, the Committee beg respectfully to invite his lordship's atten - tion to the deep resentment the extension of the War to the Red Sea ports has caused among the Mussulmans of India who, besides religious ties, have in common with their Parsee and Hindu fellow-subjects, extensive commercial relations with the Arabian coast-towns. 16lviABtat2The Central Moslem League and other Mussulman organisations have expressed identical views in connection with the effect which the Italian operations in the Red Sea are having on Mussulman feeling. 2. The Committee venture to hope that His Majesty's Govern* ment will use their Lest endeavours to induce the Italian Government to confine this unfortunate War within the tract for the possession of which it was undertaken, as its exten sion to other quarters will only lead to further embitter - ment and exasperation.

The threat to blockade these ports has caused con- siderable alarm to the Muhammadan Community and if allowed to he carried out will lead to most deplorable results.

Foreign Office and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. March U+ , 1912 912 Sir I arn directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you, herewith, for the information of the Secretary t of State for India, copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Agent and Consul General at Cairo, respecting the existing state of affairs in the Hejaz. It has been reported on more than one occasion that the Italians were affording assistance and encouragement to Seyid Idriss-, who is still in revolt and against whom operations are now being carried on by the Turkish authorities. It is possible that the success ol Seyid Idriss would have the grave consequences anticipated by Lord Kitchener. The Marquess of Crewe will, however, observe from Sir The Under Secretary oi State, India Office.G-. Lowther’s despatch Mo. 179 of February 28th, copy of which I sm also to transmit, herewith, that the Turkish Government appear to have no apprehension of such an eventuality, and Major Tyrrell in his report, enclosed in Sir G. Lowther’ s above mentioned despatch, seems also to consider it unlikely. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,{Ur' \ (^5 Viscount Kitchener to Sir HJdward Grey.—(Received March 8, 2*10 p.m.) (No. 10.) R. Cairo, March 8, 1912, 1 p.m. WITH reference to your telegram No. 16 (repeats Rome, No. 14, Treaty) of yesterday. It is most unlikely that contrabandists from Hedjaz would in any case attempt to reach Tripoli via Suakin ; nevertheless, the local authorities will be warned to exercise vigilance in this respect. It appears to me that the existing state of affairs in Hedjaz may very probably cause some danger to pilgrimage. The Italians are apparently supplying arms to Sheikh Idrisi, who is in revolt and may make an armed attempt on the holy places. This would endanger the position of Shereef of Mecca, and put the whole of Hedjaz in a blaze. Mussulmans here and in the Soudan are doing what they can to influence Idrisi to remain quiet while the present state of hostility with Italy exists. I ;151 779]179 February 28th, 1912. I have the honour to transmit a despatch which I have received iron the Military Attache to this Embassy regarding the late Italian action at Beirut, and the present position in the Hejaz and Yemen. In the latter connection anc with reference to Sir R. Rodd's despatches Nos. 31 and 35 (enclosed In your despatch No. 62 of the 19th instant) I have the honour to report that Assym Bey quite recently told me that it was perfectly true that the Italians had been p-iving money to Bald Idrise, but that the Turkish Government had no anxiety whatever on that score. He could be easily suppressed v/ith the troops at their disposal in the Yemen and these latter had supplies and ammunition enough to last for two years. The Imam Yahiu was quiet and the Government had no reason to believe that he was not satisfied with the arrangement recently concluded His 8 Hi ir Honourable Sir Edward Grey Hart., K.G.

Sir:- With refarance to the Italian action at Beirut, I have the honour to state that this and other similar action in the future do not seem to me calculated to produce the desired impression on the Turkish Military Authorities, whose attitude on the question is pretty accurately expressed in the annexed cutting from the •Jeune Turc*. About a week ago I was discussing with Mahmud Shevket Pasha the possibility of decisive action by the Italians with a view to the termination of hostlll ties. Beirut was mentioned. He said that a hcmbard- rnent was impossible, it being an undefended port. No action there would have any influence on the war, and its only result would be the expulsion of Italians. He was full of confidence, and said that it was quite im possible for the Italians to pass the Dardanelles. •Nous avcns des mines', he said, as if he were impart ing a great piece of news and as if that clinched the natter ia Excellency The Right Honourable, Sir Gerard. Lcwther, G.C.M.G. 2.3*matter, 'txrjl behinc. the mineB and the 1'ortb is our fleet 14 . I hear hcv/ever that the mcrai of the TurKish fleet has toon deteriorating during its long period of inaction ac i-.agax*a 9 and that f ires axe not keyt up as they shoulu he. In other directions too Turkish vigil ance soems tc have been somewhat relaxed lately. All the huropoan hoc If unite have been disbanded, and re servists have been dismissed in considerable numbera, thougi their places have hjer filled to some extant by call ing up others, cnn by incorporating recruits. Though acme riuaio battalions have boon transf erred to i the Asiatic shore of the Larcianeiles to replace the dish-anc ed Kedif battalions oi the second class which were thoro, the roev.it is that the force at the Dardan elles, aS well at in Otliei i laCuo , is ic'SC tnan -.0 ■«0.0 tv;o months agp # and a surpria® attack la perhaps noro likely to succeed than the Turks thirac. However they consider that 11 that is necessary has oeen done, one. there have boon no .'’iiovooiont o oi pi epaiationo t&gt;o i ucord since the .•cginnirg of the year.reaeineBB, anct can. be collected and embccjeci again at very short notice. The opinion in military circles is that, even if the Italian fleet were to effect the passage of the Dardanelles, with or without loss, arc were to appear before Constantinople, this would not end the war* As regards Italian action in the Yemeni, which is A ^ \ju [ ^ alluded to in the cutting annexed to this despatch, it will probably be confined to moral and materxal assist* anca to Bald Idriss, against whom operations are now being carried out* It is true that the position of the TurKish trooy:s in those parts, cut off as they are from all re inf or cement, is not an enviable one. But it is by no means certain that they can not hold thoir own for a very long time, not meiely against Bale Idi 1 S£&gt; in Assyr but also against a general Aiat rising in the Yemen districts which were Bubdued last* year, on -vent which is moreover consider sc to co tioso iupr. obeAhle. The only way in which operations here might decis ively affect the result of the war with Italy would to tlit complete defeat of the Turxs in Assyr, iallowed A a successful invasion of the Heja# by Bald Idriss. Mahmudv/ituiiAuc SiievKdu PaBha taiiB mu tnut the XurKisii troops i'i ohe Yemen anii Asnyi* no-.v anount* to 46000 men, but hits figures ere always unreliable, and I think he overstates their present strength. Roughly, fiity battalions and hall a dozen moun tain batter!es were sent there during 1911 in connection with the Yemen ana Assyr expeditions, totalling about 35000 men, Though it is quite impossible to say how many oi these men remain now, it is fairly certain that losses* chiefly iioin disease, have been very heavy, ana that not more than two-t hi res of the force j. 6 now available, in audition to the troops ol the expedi tionary force, there is the pemanent garrison of the Yemen, the XIV Army Corps - l i battalions. Metoud Shevket PtiSha says tviat the proper strength oi this Array Corps is 25000. 1 think IGuGO would no a bo a liberal estimate for it. The fact that there are now 11000 recruits destined for the XIV Army Corps who an no bains' trainee in other places owing to the ira- posaibilify of sending than to the Yemen, shows that this Array Corps was very tax below its paper strength. I therefore astiiaaite the nunber of Turkish troopsnow in t&gt;u- Yemen ?nc Assyr at from SO,GOO tc 35 /XO, Of this force, some 20 hettnlicnr are now cn the road Konfitfa-''ikhell-.Abha, confrontinr Bald Idrlss, who in alec linhl(: tc ho '.tt eked hy troope cc-cpera- tlnr from the side of Hcdoicn.
