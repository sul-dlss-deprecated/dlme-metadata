No. 1373. Minister© des Affaires Etrangeres du Hoyaume de Yougoslavie, 6 th March, 1943. ; 4 o My dear Ambassador, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter Y.P. 45 of the 2 nd March, together v/ith the Aide Memoire, concerning the demobilization at the end of the war of the Allied Forces which are now on Egyptian territory* As you point out in your letter, there is every reason to anticipate that the Yugoslav forces now in Egypt will, long before the formal termination of hostilities, have left Egypt in order to take part in the liberation of Yugoslavia* therefore, in the name of the Yugoslav Government I have the honour to give by this letter the formal assurance that the Yugoslav personnel in Egypt will, when the time comes, be demobilized outside Egypt and without the Egyptian Government being involved i i any expenditure in connection with their removal from Egypt. Should any Yugoslav forces still remain in Egypt, the Yugoslav Government would in the ordinary course bring them back to Yugoslavia be ’ore any question of their demobilization arose or, if any members of these forces had for so '*6 reason to be demobilized in Egypt, steps would be taken to bring them back to Yugoslavia immediately at the expense of the Yugoslav Government. Believe me, etc., (Signed) S. Yovanovitch His Excellency Sir George Rendel, K.C. M.G., British Ambassador to Yugoslavia.that this assurance should be supplemented by similar assurances from the Allied Governments concerned. 3. In so far as any Yugoslav Forces which may be in £gypt at the termination of hostilities are concerned, the question appears to be one of form rather than of substance, since there is every reason to anticipate that long before the formal termination of hostilities all the Yugoslav Forces will have left Egypt in order to take part in the liberation of Yugoslavia. Should any Yugoslav Forces still remain in Egypt, 1 presume that the Yugoslav Government would in the ordinary course bring them back to Yugoslavia before any question of their demobilisation arise, or that, ii any members of these fbrees had for aome reason to be demob Used in Egypt, steps would no doubt be taken to bring them ba:.k to Yugoslavia immediately, at the expense of the Yugoslav Government. In order, however, that the Egyptian Governments wishe 3 may be met, and in order that the arrangement made by Hr Miles Lampaon regarding the grant of the necessary facilities for passage into and out of Egypt of members of the Allied Forces in the Middle East may go through without difficulty, His Majesty’s Government are anxious to obtain the desired assurances from all the Allied Governments. I greatly hope therefore that you will be able to give this assurance, and in ordor to facilitate your consideration of the raatter I enclose herein an aide memoire setting out in greater detail the particular ooint at issue. Believe me, etc., (3 igned} G. r; .

My dear Ambassador, You wilL probably remexnber that when you called on me on June 15th last, you were so good as to leave with rne an Aide-Memoire concerning negotiations conducted by the British Ambassador in Cairo with the Egyptian Government to facilitate the entry into and departure fbom Egypt of members 0 f the Allied Forces. You said further in the memorandum that, as a result of these negotiations, the British Ambassador was able, in December 1941, to secure the consent of the Egyptian Government to the extension de facto to serving members of Allied Forces of the' privileges enjoyed by the British Forces as regards entry into and departure from Egypt. You told me, at the same time, that the Egyptian Government asked for assurance that the Allied personnel concerned would, when the time came, be demobilised outside Egypt and without the Egyptian Government being involved in any expenditure over their removal from Egypt, and that, in the event of any member of the Allied Forces (with the exception of those who have been residing in Egypt previous to their enlistment) cheeking to establish themselves clandestinely in Egyot, the necessary assistance would be given by the British and Allied authorities to trace him and to secure his removal from Egypt. I understand from your Aide-k'femoire that the British Government have given the Egyptian Government an assurance on the lines requested, on behalf of the British Military authorities in their capacity of the Allied High Command in Egypt. It appears, however, that the Egyptian Government desire that this assurance be supplemented by similar assurances from the Allied Governments concerned. ^opy VW 11624/78/64) ho. 745/57.

BEXTISH MISSION TO THE FREE FRENCH NATIONAL COMMITTEE, Clarence House, Matthew Parker Street, London, S # ¥*l. 24th June, 1942. My dear Jack, Reference William Strang’s letter (W 8276/78/64) of June 9th, I enclose copy of Dejean’s reply to our letter of June 18th (8209/3/42), of which I sent you a copy. f You will note, and if you wish to take action on M. Dejean’s request in paragraph 5, that Sir Miles Lampson should keep informed Baron de Benoist, the Free French representative in Egypt. Yours ever, (Signed) CHARLES PEAKE. J.C. Ward, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.l. Han approach through His Lajesty s Govornmont directly to .the Allied governments in london, with a view to their authorising him to convey thrir assurances collectively to the Egyptian Government. 2. The matter has now been considered by the Alii' d Forces (Official) Committee who agreed with dir Liles Lampson f s view that the question of these assurances should be taken up with the -Hied governments in london, but recognised that the approach was of some delicacy, as it was possible that the Allied governments might feel that their local representatives in Egypt ought to have been consulted at the time of the negotiations. It was also felt that some of the governments might prefer to give their assurances directly to the Egyptian Government through their own representatives in Cairo. The Committee reached the conclusion that the best course would be for the matter to be raised with the allied governments by means of an -- ide memoire which Your Exce llency would be invited to you communicate to them through the diplonatic channel, rather than by an official circular note from myself to the allied diplomatic representatives in London. 3. I concur in the recommendations of the Allied Forces Committee, and'I now transmit to Your Excellency you herewith, for convenience, in the form in which they were circulated to the Committee, copies of the covering despatch of the 20th February from His Majesty’s Ambassador^at Cairo and of the main correspondence between Sir Liles Lampson and Hussein Sirry Pasha, together with the draft recommended by the Committee for the proposed aide memoire to the Allied governments. Provided Your ^xctllency sees no you see objection I should be grateful if you would communicate an aide memoire on the model of the enclosed draft to the /Belgian etc._/ Government, and will inform mo in due course of their reaction.
