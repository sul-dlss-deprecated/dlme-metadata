Office of the Political Agent, Bahrain, Camp, Buehire, Dated the 28th October 1932* From - The Political Agent, Bahrain, at Buahire. To - The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* Sir, I have the honour to say that since the arrival of the Persian Uavy is now a concrete fact,very early steps should J3e taken to consider what our course should be should units of this fleet arrive unannounced at Bahrain, 2, The final view of Sir Hugh Biscoe appeared to be ( telegram Mo.T.34, dated the 30th January 1932 ) that if they visited Bahrain in such a way they should be received in the first instance with courtesy, but that the Shaikh should then ask that in future prior notification of such visits should be given him. It appears to me, however, that this attitude must be modified by the fact that at our instance,His Excellency has already asked for prior notification, and it remains now to be considered whether some more definite policy should not be decided upon. 3. We must consider three hypotheses. In the first, let us suppose, a Persian warship arrives but does not land any officers or men. This would not involve any difficulties and the State’s protest would be reported by the Political Agent: .. •..Agent* secondly, they might land officers for purposes of a ceremonial Yialt, or email parties of men for the purchase of prorisions, etc* It would be difficult for the State to resist this, and the officers and men would be allowed to land, a protest being subsequently made* There remains, howeYer, a third possibility, though I consider it unlikely so long as Italians -amain in charge of these Yessels* 1% has been stated, however, on good authority, that Persians will now take command of these Yessels and that the Italians will be Tcc^.rv*~£,A.C retained in a purely capacity* 1 personally have had ample experience of the highhandedness and arbitrary methods of Persian military officers on land, and have no reason to expect a different mentality in their naval confreres tVe must therefore consider the possible landing of armed parties* 4* It is unlikely that a sloop can arrive in time to support the State before one of these three eventualities occur Is it considered that the State should allow an armed party to land without let or hindrance, or that they should prevent them by force, if necessary, from doing so ? Both courses would open the way to grave difficulties* If the State allows armed forces to land without taking action, the Persians will have successfully asserted their claim to the Islands. On the other hand, should the embarkation of the party be opposed there is the possibility of casualties occurring and a very serious situation would immediately arise* I do not doubt that the State could mobilise sufficient force to prevent such landing, should the Persian contingent push the matter to extremes* &amp;• It is obviously undesirable that our line of action should be left to a frantic last-minute decision - a decision which • • •&amp;-3- r which might possibly have to be taken by the State in the temporary absence of the Political Agent* and I therefore request tua'L definite instructions may be given me as to what course I siiould advise the State to pursue in the event of an unannounced arrival of a Persian warship* I have the honour to be, Sir, four most obedient servant.

Sir, In continuation of my telegram No. 175 of 3rd November 1932, I have the honour to offer the following ohservations upon the question of Persian visits to AfaB ports or Persian aggression against Bahrein. . 2. I should explain at the , outset that i since I received your telegram No il of February 21st authorising me to make a communication to the Persian Government on the u@tgect of the visits of their war- -ships to A^CaB ports, I have once or twice tried in conversation with the Minister of ^ourt to lead the conversation into lines which would have given me a suitable opportunity for making this communication. Bis Highness never showed any desire to follow my lead though he indicated in vague terms that if the Persia ships ever desired to visit Arab ports the ordinary courtesies would be observed. You will recollect that my anxiety to receive this c&amp;rthorisation origi- -nally arose from a aesire to counteract the possible effects upon the Persian Government of the warning given to the Italian Government, should the former become aware that this warning had been given. The passage of time has,howevep, rendered impossible a communication... • The Bight Honourable Sir John Simon, G.G.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office2 4 I vh v communicatiQn on the lines that I originally contemplated and the necessity of making any communication at all has, from my point of view, correspondingly decreased. 3. It is, at the same time, obvious that in the absence of what I may call a natural opportunity, an intimation to the Persian Government that we expected their warships to observe ordinary international courtesies before visiting an Arab port might be regarded as gratuitously offensive. It would be very difficult to make a warning appear as anything else than an intimation of this kind and, whatever misgivings we may like to feel, the sound tactical course would, I am convinced, be to let the xer- -sian Government think we take it for granted that they intend to behave like civilised beings. 4. This point of view postulates a certain lack of belief in the likelihood of unheralded visits, and even less belief in the likelihood of aggression. If, however, I am wrong and if in fact the idea of either is firmly implanted in thejp minds of the Persian Government! the absence of a formal warning would not, I feel, weaken our case when it becomes necessary to bring the Persian Government to book, as after all the discussion which has taken place on the subject of ships*visits in connection with the General Treaty and the notification of the pro- -pcsed call at Muscat which we recently received, they could hardly plead ignorance of what the proper procedure is. This applies more particularly to active aggression the only conceivable purpcee of which would be to bring the Bahrein...-Bahrein issue “before the League of Nations. 5 . There reinains the question of unheralded visits, for all tbe variations of these, even including a visit to Bahrein in the course of which a ship’s party was landed, not with the idea of actual aggression 'but in order to assert a claim to the island ( see paragraph 3(d) of Bushire teleferam No 705 of October 1st to the India Office), I must confess to a sneaking fondness for the course advocated 'by the late Sir Hugh Biscoe of receiving the warships with all courtesy and afterwards telling the Persian G-overnment that much as the ftuler concerned had enjoyed the visit, he would prefer on future occasions to receive a notification that a visit was to take place. Such a message if adequate- -ly conveyed and subsequently advertised if the Persian G-overnment showed any inclination to A disputaceous would, it seems to me, adequately redress the balance. 6 . These in brief are my reasons for believing that in ordinary circumaaSjbnces a warning to the Persian Oovernment would f asjindicated in my telegram under refer- -eiice, be a mistake. But I realise that the feelings of the Arab population's must be taken into account and I therefore entirely agree, if the Political Resident con- -siders it desirable, that the natural opportunity pre- -sented by your despatch No 548 of 8th October last, en- -closing a draft exchange of notes regarding the visits of British warships to Persian ports, should be seized • The course I have in mind is to inform the Minister of Court that I have received your instructions on the subj ect...•v '1 ' ' ' w vNt| 4. V/ sulDject, and if I find that he insists on modifying the pure doctrine of notification, say that I presume that he will at least agree to the procedure sketched therein; that in any case His Majesty's Government do not propose to p^adcca. depart from their own^in respect of British ports: and that as regards Arab ports in the lersian Gulf, while I cannot say-exactly what procedure the various rulers may require hereafter, it may he taken for granted that the very least they will require for the present will he ade- •quate notification such as the Persian Government gave in the case of the proposed visit of their fleet to Muscat. 7. In conclusion I may add that if the Persian Government were to adopt course 3(c) in Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle's telegram No 705, that it is to say, to send a war dship to Bahrain with instructions to pay ceremonial visit to the Shaikh and the Political Agent, I would suggest wel- -coming rather than rehuLyffing such a visit. Nothing could he clearer evidence of the recognition of the Shaikh as an independent ruler hy the Persian Government, in fact the evidence would he so clear tuat I think the Persian Governmet do would not he so foolish to A anything of the sort.

My views are set forth in my letter of 7th September 1931, 3 . If Persian warships visit Bahrain there are four possibilities. (a) No party will be landed. ( b) Party will be landed to purchase provisions etc. (c) Ceremonial visit on Shaikh and Political Agent will be sought. (d) Armed party will be landed not with the idea of actual aggression but to assert Persian claim to island. If (a) then policy advocated by Biscoe is suitable. (b) This will have to be permitted i. (c) I suggest that I advise Shaikh and ..... \ PoliticalPolitical Agent not to receive it on grounds that as Bahrain is an independent state notification should have been given* Since Shaikh has at our request informed us formally that he expects notification of•visit, if none has been given he and his Government will not unnaturally be much offended. (d) Legally such party could be resisted by force but for various reasons I do not suggest this* The landing of such a perty however would of course be a most serious step on the part of the Persian Government* 5. In all the circumstances I am still of opinion that some sort of warning be conveyed to the Persian Government.

It now seems that Minister nt Tehran has not yet taken action and he is of course in best position to estimate Persian reaction to such a warning, partici 1^ly in view of recent developments regarding Henjam.

At the same time, if visit of Persian warship is made to Shaikh's territory without notification, which is contingency I have in mind, then Persian Government have ipso facto disregarded independence of Shaikh concerned and I do not think that a ceremon^il call on Ruler, such as might be paid by Persian representatives on a Persian Governor or notable in a Persian port, would make up for non-notification, while the acceptance of such a call by the Ruler would surely fcondone the non-notification and weaken any subsequent protest. Moreover the effect on local opinion in the State of the Ruler of such acceptance would be undesirable and would not of course be corrected by a protest made at Tehran. • • •COPY Copy sent to Government of India* India Office, WHITEHALL, S.W.l# P*2.7127/32. 28th November 1932. Secret* Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd November, No* M.02989/32, on the subject of the action to be taken in the event of Persian warships visiting the States on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf without notification, and to refer to the latest telegrams (noted in the margin) on this subject from the Government of India and the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf* 2. Sir Samuel Hoare has carefully ') Prom Government of India ) 21st November, 2621* Prom Political Resident, ) 24th November,T/l03. ) _) considered the situation as a whole in the i, V, v^ v The Secretary, ADMIRALTY, S.W.l, light of the views expressed by the various authorities interested* No difficulty appears to arise as regards contingencies (a) and (b) discussed in paragraph 3 of Colonel Powle’s telegram No.705 of 31st October. As regards Qontingency (c) referred to in that telegram, the point is perhaps not of very substantial importance save in the case of Bahrain. In the case of the other Arab States of the Persian Gulf, if the Commander of a Persian warship expresses his desire to pay a ceremonial call, despite the fact that prior notification has not been given of the arrival of his ship, the Secretary of State, in the light of the views expressed in paragraph 2 of the Admiralty letter of 22nd November, agrees that such a call might be accepted on the first occasion, though it should in his view, be followed up ...up by formal representations at Tehran regarding the visit of a Persian war ship without notification. ’The position is different in the case of Bahrain. 3ir 3anuel hoare appreciates the force of the arguments adduced by His Majesty’s Minister, and supported by t e Government of India, as of the counter arguments suggested in Colonel Fowle’s telegram of 24th November. It is, per haps,as the Minister suggests, very improbable that the Persians will risk compromising their claim to Bahrain by instructing or permitting an officer of their Navy to pay a ceremonial call on the ihaikh. But on the other hand tne danger cannot be overlooked that the Opportunity of such a ceremonial visit, were the Shaikh to accept it, might be taken by the Persians to intimate in a public manner,e.g. in the event of His Kxcellency ®ceiving the party in Durbar, that he was regarded as p Persian subject, while any action on their part which could be construed as a formal recognition of the Shaikh’s independence would inevitably be disavowed by Persia. On the whole, however, having regard to the considerations advanced by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State considers that the best course would be to leave to the discretion of the Political Agent, Bahrain, in the light of all the circumstances including those in which the Persian ship has arrived at Bahrain, the question whether or not a ceremonial call, if offered, should be accepted. In the event of any such call being accepted and passing without incident he would, however, propose first that the Shaikh should be advised not to receive a further cereraonail call from a ship visiting without notice, and secondly that a formal notification should at once be made to the Persian Government in the name of the shaikh that in future formal : notice of such visits must be given. The Shaikh might in this connection take the opportunity to refer tf 0 ]ai6 desirefor notifloatior in any remarks he might address to the representatives of the Persian ship* instructions which, subject to the concurrence of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir 3.

In the event of visit without previous notification H.M*s. Government approve action suggested in contingencies (a) and (b) in paragraph 3 of Residents telegram of 31st October, 705. 3. As regards contingency (c) Admiralty draws attention to risk that refusal of call on first occasion might give grounds for charge of discourtesy and state that foreign warships occasionally visit British ports in various parts of the world without giving usual notice. Morevoer vessels calling Imut.) con- -tingency (b) might conceivably wish to pay bona fide ceremonial call. Call should therefore be (mut.) permitted on first occasion save at Bahrain but should be followed by formal protest in name of ruler concerned against absence of notification. In the case of Bahrain H.M’s. Government recognise that Persia might contend that acceptance of call during un-notified visit constituted recognition of Persian suzerainty and would certainly repudiate any counter-assertion that call constituted recognition of Shaikh's independence: since, however Shaikh would only be following normal internation- -al practice in receiving such call in spite of omission to notify, H.M's. Government considers it desirable that Shaikh should afford usual courtesies unless the attendant‘W’ i(§) attendant circumstances are quite exceptional* e*g* dis- -courtesies to harbour officials or acute tension in Anglo-Persian relations. The f are prepared to leave to the Political Agent’s discretion to act in the light of his estimate of the circumstances. In the event of call following xkxju an un-notified visit being accepted and passing without incident immediate formal protest would be made at Tehran. 4. As regards contingency (d) H.M’s. Government suggest that in the event of Persians sending armed party to land at Bahrain the party should be met at pier by (preferably) European representative of Shaikh ( e.g. Belgrave) by whom they should be informed on behalf of Shaikh that His Excellency could not agree to party land- -ing with arms but that no objection would feu be seen to their landing without arms for purpose of purchasing provisions, etc. 5. If in light of communication of this nature, Persians were nevertheless to land with arms question of employment of force would depend on their attitude and actual proceedings. Clearly they could not be allowed to behave in such a manner as to undermine the authority of the Shaikh or our prestige in the eyes of the populat- -ion. But question whether xfe and at what point Politic -al Agent should advise intervention of Bahrain police force must be left to his discretion if and when such a situation should arise. If intervention did become necessary, our position would have been strengthened by communication made to landing party at the commencement and onus of aggression would rest on the Persians. 6. Risk of attempted armed landing is probably serious only at Bahrain, but similar action to that suggested above might also be taken in the event of landing at Kuwait or Muscat. As regards Trucial Coast wewe shall probably have to take our chance and protest immediately on behalf of the Shaikhs affected. 7. Possibility of armed landing on Tamb, Abu Musa or other Arab islands cannot be overlooked but we obviously cannot immobilise sloops with object of jucKXSKgXJi consider preventing this. H.M’s. Government jucgxxiigfciHg&amp;xfcKX khixic that risk must be faced. But immediate report should be sent in event of any action of this nature by Persian Navy with a view to necessary steps being taken. 8* H.M*s. Government understand that Trucial flags are constantly flown at Tamb and Abu Musa. It might be as well, if this can be done without attracting undue attention, to ensure so far as possible that on other inhabited islands belonging to or claimed by Arab rulers Trucial or other appropriate Arab flag is also kept flying.

P, I approve the terras of your note No.403 of the 3rd August to the Persian Minister for foreign Affairs on this subj ect, 3. r ’*he general attitude of His Majesty’s Government on the question of the right of innocent passage through terri torial waters is set forth in their reply to a question- naire circulated in connection with the draft ’♦Arti cles concerning the Legal Ptatus of the territorial Gea, ’ drawn up at the Hague Conference of 1930.

I am advised that at present there exists in the Persian Gulf no special usage in thin matter, and it is indeed important that no action should be tahen which might weaken, as far as the Gulf is concerned, the principle of the right of innocent passage through territorial waters, since, as you are aware, a part of the 9ooka Channel, which gives access to the Shatt el Arab, must probably be regarded as Persian.

I consider, however, that no undesirable precedent will have been established by vour orotest, in f he present cane, against the use of ?'uscati waters by 3 :) ersian launches as a base of operations for the capture of the dhow, and against the fact that the captured vessel was kept under arrest in Muscat! waters, i.e. rana ined at anchor there for a considerable time. 6. ^ith regard to paragraph 5 of the India Office letter of the 30th August, I shall be glad to learn your views of! the desirability of notifying the Persian Govern ment formally on behalf of the Multan of Muscat if it should later be decided to cancel or modify the Muscat Proclamation of 189R.
