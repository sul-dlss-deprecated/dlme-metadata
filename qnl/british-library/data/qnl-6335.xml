S. “ Espiegle ” at Maskat, The 25th September 1912. P-12. Sir, I have the honour to submit the attached report which I called for owing to Major Craufurd’s remarks, copy attached, in his report Secret No. 68, dated at Maskat 1st September 1912. 2. I have not had experience of Kuwait Pearling dhows but have never found others with more than two rifles, one being the more usual number, and when these are of old pattern or from their rusty state show obvious signs of being retained on board for a long time, it has been customary to allow the dhows to retain them. . Large trading dhows sometimes have 4 rifles but with this number they almost invariably have passes for them ; should they not have passes signed by a Political Officer, they are told that they are lucky to be allowed to retain their arms and had better get a pass quickly. 3. In view of the general regulation of the Arms Trade which is in course of being carried out, it would appear advisable to issue instructions to His Majesty’ Ships on the subject of rifles allowed to be carried by native craft. Piracies are extremely rare and the methods of the pirates appear to be such that the crews of dhows attacked have as a rule little chance of arming them selves before being shot down or driven overboard. For this reason I see no necessity for allowing a rifle to every man in any dhow and consider 4 rifles sufficient for the largest dhow. Special cases, such as those of merchants visiting the Pearl Banks with large quantities of specie might be dealt with as they arise by the local Political officers. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sd.) C. M. LEFROY, Commander and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, The Commander in-Chief, His Majesty’s Ships and Vessels, etc., etc.X 3 ARMS. H. M. S. “Sphinx” at Reshire. The 12th September 1912. No. 12 - 1912 . In compliance with your memorandum of 5th September, I have the honour to forward the following remarks :— No Kuwait Pearling dhows were communicated with, the banks above Tas Tanura not being visited. The number of rifles seen in other Pearling dhows has varied from two to four, the latter being the largest number seen in any dhow up to date ; it is pro bable the largest dhows carry up to six. Only small Merchant and Towashi dhows have so far been seen, and they have not had more than two to four rifles amongst a total crew of about six men. I suggest that some fixed scale be laid down as to the number of rifles allowed to be carried in proportion to the crew. The Political Agents at Bahrain and Kuwait might be asked for their opinions on this subject. Piracies do not appear to be so frequent as to necessitate more than ten rifles being carried in the largest Pearling dhows. With reference to the Merchant and Towashi dhows, I consider they are justified in carrying one rifle per man in the small dhows, and that from 12 to 15 would be ample for the larger ones with crews of about 40 men.

From— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Political Agent, Maskat, To—L ieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K C.I.E , C.S.I, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 1 have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Circular letter No. 2530, dated the 12th October 1912 on the subject of the need of Pearling dhows to carry arms and to state that I consulted His Highness the Sultan on the subject. 2. His Highness replied that the matter did not seem to be one that touched him closely. The only Pearling dhows that go from his territories are those bound for the Red Sea. Owing to the recent action of the Italians, such vessels are eager to provide themselves with passes from His Highness which are care fully scrutinized by this office and His Highness* signature is countersigned by myself. The number and description of the arms carried are carefully noted and I have recently added the following innovation which has been accepted by His Highness without objection. If the arms are newly bought, they carry the Warehouse marks and numbers and can thus be easily recognised. Even if the weapons are old ones, I insist on their being taken to the Superintendent of the Warehouse and marked with the Warehouse seal and number, before I counter sign the pass and so long as this is done and the marks on the rifles correspond with those noted in the pass and the rifles are produced for inspection by His Majesty’s Ships, His Highness thinks, and I agree, that the number is a matter of indifference. As a matter of fact, the highest number of rifles for which I have countersigned a pass is 5 and the more usual number is two or three. 1 he two main classes of vessels for which such passes issue are :— (1) pearling vessels proceeding to the Red Sea. (2) trading vessels proceeding to Basrah to load dates. 3. After my conversation of this morning with His Highness, 1 venture to express the opinion that the procedure noted above in paragraph 2 is sufficient and unobjectionable and that no further alterations are called for so far as regards Maskat waters. No. 524, dated 25th October 1912. From— Captain D. L. R. Lorimer, I. A., Political Agent, Bahrain, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Circular No. 2530 dated 12th October 1912, referring to the question of the armament of the Pearling dhows. 2. I approached Shaikh Isa to day on the subject cautiously, so as not to alarm him, and found him not at all inclined to contemplate the possibility of introducing any sort of regular system. He took for granted that it was necessary that the dhows should carry arms. He stated that most of the Pearling boats were owned by the big “ Qaba, II ” such as the Dawasir and An Na, im, etc., and that they managed them according to old-established custom. He implied that they would not readily consent to having their previously-unquestioned freedom to arm their boats as they thought necessary, interfered with. 3. Shaikh Isa thought that few boats carried more than 15 rifles, and that many carried only 6 or 7. They were not all carried so that they could be seen except on a thorough inspection of the ship. 4. As regards my own views, I think that total disarmament (which I know is not proposed) would be impossible. Similarly if it were generally known that there was a strict limitation of the arms carried, to small numbers, I think that probably more piracies would be attempted. One gunboat cruising over some hundreds of miles of banks during a part of the season affords no real guarantee against isolated attacks on individual pearling boats.5. I also think that any attempt on the part of Shaikh Isa to introduce regulations limiting the arms to be carried, would be strongly resented and probably openly disregarded by the bulk of the Pearlers. I cannot imagine in view of the entire inefficiency of his whole administration, what machinery he could apply which would be the least effective in enforcing them. Shaikh Isa as we already know', is afraid to enforce his authority on the Dawasir or indeed on any one of any strength who objects to it. I do not think it would be advis able to force him to do so in a case like this which would not be recognised as reasonable by a single one of his subjects. 6. If the thing is to be done at all as far as Bahrain is concerned, it should be done, I think, by our simply publishing an order that Pearling dhows carrying rifles in excess of a fixed scale based on the number of the crew, will have their weapons confiscated by our gunboats, and by our then acting on this declaration. Otherwise we should have to fight Shaikh Isa, coerce him, and then bolster him up against his subjects. 7. Personally I know nothing to make me think that the carrying of arms by Bharain boats is other than for bond fide self-protection, and I have heard nothing while here to make me think that it is appreciably abused. Unless there is really good reason to believe that the Bahrain Pearlers systematically engage in the Arms Traffic, or until it is found that they use their arms for purposes^ of piracy, disturbance or other illegitimate objects, without prejudice to possible considerations of which I have no knowledge, I do not myself see any very good reason for interfering with them. However that m^y be, any interference will be regarded by the persons affected and the general public here, as tyrannical and unreasonable. 8. As a possible basis for a system of limited armament I would suggest, in the case of the Fishing Boats, I rifle per 5 men of the complement; in the case of Merchants’ (Tawwashes) boats, the same scale, with a permitted minimum of 4 rifles. No. C-69, dated the 6th November 1912. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to reply to your Circular letter No. 2530, dated the 12th October 1912, requesting my views regarding the need of Pearling dhows to carry arms and measures for regulation as to the number required. 2 2. Major Craufurd’s Secret Report No. 58, dated the 1st September 1012, so far as it relates to Kuwait, is founded largely on information which I supplied to him and the chief reason for Kowait Pearl boats carrying arms so largely in excess of the^numbers found in other Pearl boats is probably the fact that their diving operations are practically confined to the banks lying north of Ras Tanura. A glance at the chart will show that the coast line north of this point is infested with shoals, and its hydrographic survey appears to have been less thorough and less recent than almost any portion of the Persian Gulf. It may be for this reason that His Majesty’s Ships on Patrol duty during the diving season seldom visit the banks worked by Kuwait boats and therefore these boats do not enjoy the same measure of protection against pirates which is afforded to Bahrain and Oman boats working further south. Such at least is the impression I have gathered from local enquiries, for Kuwait owners seldom report that their pearl fleets have been visited or sighted by a man-of-war. As the same time the shore north of Katif is the district in which the Bani Hajir Bedouin, from whom the pirates on the pearl banks generally spring, spend their summer. They are usually near the coast with friends and relations among the divers and are conse quently in the best position for ascertaining the most favourable opportunity for a descent on some helpless boat, though attacks may be few the danger presents itself as a very real one to the boats, especially if they should happen to become separated.6 3. Such being the state of affairs it will be difficult to urge upon Shaikh Mubarak a reduction in the number of arms carried by Kuwait dhows. ^ ven 1 he were willing personally, I doubt his ability to enforce a reduction or the voice of the pearling community is not one which he is in a position eit ler o ignore to suppress. A. Accordingly I consulted him on what measures he would be inclined to take for regulating the number of arms carried, suggesting that t e ^ r f ic es 0 each boat should be endorsed with the number of arms it was permitted to carry for protection. This plan was not feasible, for pearl boats carry no articles such as the sea-going trading dhows. He was averse also to the institution of regu ar articles, alleging a fear that the pearling community would be suspicious ot^ some move on his part towards extra taxation, and because pearl-boats are continually changing owners. He was prepared, however, to require ^ each pearl-nakhoda before sailing for the season to take from him a paper in which would be state the number of arms his particular boat was allowed and, if it could be arranged, to have all these papers sent to this Agency for the Political Agent s endorse ment. He desired, however, to talk over the matter with the heads of the pearl ing community before committing himself. 5. The Shaikh informed me that the large trading dhows now seldom carried arms on the voyage between India and Kuwait though no boat ventured into the shatt-al-Arab without the means of defence. Such boats plying Shutt al-Arab usually carried half-a-dozen rifles, whilst pearling boats armed about half their complement and Towashi boats armed every man on board. 6. If the system outlined can be made to work with the Shaikh s concur rence and without irritating the pearling community I venture to submit that it would go far towards ultimate regulation and provided we are aware of the number of arms each vessel is licensed to carry it matters comparatively little whether the number is three or four or half her complement. The system would have the advantage of furnishing us with a definite idea of the numbers of boats and men employed in pearl fishing as well as of the number of rifles, and would help His Majesty’s Ships in arriving at a clear conclusion as to the number of arms permitted in any particular boat which happened to be searched.

Bethell, K.C.M.G., Commander-in-Chief, His Majesty's Ships and Vessels, East Indies Squadron, H.M.S. “ Highflyer, ” Muscat. I have the honour to reply to your letter No. I462-XIX-U., dated October 2nd 1912, regarding the regulation of the number of rifles that native craft may be permitted to carry, for purposes of self-protection. 2. The question was raised primarily with reference to Pearling dhows, and as a result of consultation with the Political Officers concerned, 1 am brought to the conclusion that no definite fixation or regulation according to scale of the numbers of rifles to be carried by Pearling craft can be attempted at present. Such a regulation would arouse no little suspicion and resentment among the pearling community and there would be considerable difficulty in enforcing it, while little evidence has been forthcoming so far to indicate that the liberty at present enjoyed by these craft, of carrying weapons for personal protection, is seriously abused. The Political Agents’ reports refer particularly to Pearling dhows, but I see no reason why we should not endeavour to arrange that any check introduced should apply to all dhows alike. 3. Subject therefore to any views Your Excellency may wish to express, and to the concurrence of the Government of India, I would propose to instruct the Political Agents at Bahrain and Kuwait to request Shaikh Isa and Shaikh Mobarak respectively to warn all Nakhodas with in their jurisdiction, both in the case of Pearling dhows and others, that they must furnish themselves with apass from their Ruler, showing in detail the number and description of arms and ammunition carried; and that any arms found on board by His Majesty’s ships in excess of, or not corresponding to, those shown on the pass, will be liable to confiscation. Such passes to be countersigned by the Political Agent concerned. I would arrange to warn the Chiefs of the Trucial Coast simultaneously to the same effect. 4. ^ Provided we are aware of the number of arms each vessel is licensed to carry, it matters little whether the number is three or four, or in the case of some pearling dhows, half the vessel’s complement. The course recommended will moreover have the advantage of furnishing Political Agents with a definite means of estimating the numbers of boats and men employed in pearl fishing and in other occupations, as well as of the number of rifles carried, and will inci dentally facilitate the identification of any particular craft by His Majesty’s ships. 5. Should Your Excellency generally concur in the above, I will address the Government of India on the receipt of your reply. ( No. 1462-XIX V., dated Maskat, the 30th November 1912.

Confirming our respects of the 18th ultimo, we beg to bring to your notice that on July 5th a. c., we made a shipment of arms and ammunition by the S. S.

In response to our various telegrams and letters requesting payment, Mr. Khan in particular telegraphed us on August 23rd, 1912 :—“ I will remit ” and in his letter dated Muscat, 3rd September a. c., he writes:— “ Turkistan ”—I am pleased to inform you that I have asked the “Mer cantile Bank of India, Ltd., Bombay, to make remittance of £1,861-11-9 (one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one and shillings eleven only) to the Chartered Bank of India, Bombay, in payment of your draft for that steamer; please apply to your Bankers, Bombay, if required.” Mr. Jaffar, also at various times, promised to pay, but unfortunately neither of them have so far done so. These customers now write in some of their last letters, saying that they are willing to pay forthwith for this TurkisUm shipment, but on condition that we allow them to deduct a certain sum which we hold from them in de posit. To these terms of payment, we absolutely refuse to agree, because, according to the conditions made when we obtained the deposits, it was under stood that this should be deducted from our last invoice for the last shipment in completion of contracts for rifles and ammunition. As those contracts were for delivery of certain quantities per month for extended periods, we should not have accepted them, unless we had the deposits to secure us the certainty of all the goods contracted for being taken. Please also note that it has come to our knowledge that both Mr. Khan and Mr. Jaffar have unlawfully taken possession of the Turkistcm shipment, without having our bills of lading which have now been handed by the Chartered Bank in Bombay, to our Agents, Messrs. Louis Dieu &amp; Co., by our instructions. Trusting that you will kindly and promptly assist us in this matter, and compel these customers, w ho, we understand, are very wealthy, to forthwith remit the full amount of our drafts plus interest at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, from August 15th a. c., until date of payment to the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Bombay.Enclosure 2.

Sir, With reference to the attached correspondence, I have the honour to report that, from notes in the 'Dhow Boarding Book' this is apparently a Dhow that was searched by H.M.S.'Philomel' on 8th December 1912 under the following circumstances. She was seen making in towards Charak from the southward. Two blank charges were fired and one live round of 3-Pdr. amnu- nition across her bows before the sails were lowered, which caused suspicion in the first place. I sent Lieutenant Davis, R.I.M., on board with directions to examine her, and that if he thought that she was suspicious and required searching we would get her alongside. Lieutenant Davis reported that he thought she was suspicious. The Dhow was flying no flag had no papers and the Nakhoda f s manner was sulky and suspi cious from the start. Lieutenant Davis said he is certain that he never mentioned anything about being a Koweit Dhow or tV'at the owner was Sheikh Mubarak. Lieutenant Davis can un derstand the language and would have recognized Sheikh Mu- marak r s name. The Nakhoda said they came from Busreh for Debai, the wind was fair for that place, they gave no special reason for going into Charak where we knew that arms were expected. There seemed every chance that the Dhow might have picked up arms on the Arabian side and be bringing them to Charak. The Nakhoda^ statements as to the men being severely beaten and their cargo damaged are entirely incorrect. The cargo was most carefully handled and carefully re-stowed after a certain amount had been taken out. None of it had dropped in the sea.

If he had a rifle and f^und he could make a profit of a few dollars on it he s r ld it and bou-ht another • B if the sheikh like to know there was one man in Ku- -wait habitually sent 20 or m«re with any caravan go -ing in that direction and the man was Yakub al Ha- -iri. who used to send to Zobeir.

The sheikh sent for Yakub and he admitted the traffic . whereupon the Sheikh was about to have hin beaten and imprisoned when he was begged off his re- -lation . another *f the Sheikh f s men, Abdulla al- Ha.iri , who paid up a fine of $ 2000/- on the spot to the Sheikh.

(2) Local information has been received to the effect that a certain arms dealer named Gholam Reza Itohanmed Khak i (age 25, short stature, not very fair) was sent by Azad Bag, Mashdi Hassan and Faji Kassim to Koweit, where he bought sixty rifles, sent them bv a jolly boat belonging to Haji Kassim and landed them at the Khor Kalah opposit Chahtal, one of the villages of Tangistan. They were then brought to Bushire with # it is said^the assistance of the Kakhoda of Reshire. (3) The same Ghoiam Reza is also reported to have purchased on joint account with the 3 arms dealers above mentioned 200,000 cartridges which are to be brought over by a jolly boat belonging to Kaji Kassim and landed at the Khor Kalah (opposite Chahtal). Gholam Reza is said to have taken a cargo of barlev for Koweit and a draft on Bombay for Rs.5,000/- and it is suggested that enquiries as to how the latter sum and the proceeds of the cargo are disposed of may throw an interesting light on the Arms Traffic at Koweit.

No. 7 C., dated Kuwait, the 29 th April 1913 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespbar, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a letter, dated the 29th Rabiath-Thani 1331 (3rd April 1913) from Abdul Aziz-as-Saud, the Amir of Nejd, together with a translation, relative to the capture of certain arms by the Residency Agent at Shargah in September last. 2. When I met the Amir of Nejd during my recent tour he mentioned the subject, but bad not received the details, nor had his agent, Abdul Aziz-al-Aomi, arrived before I left. He asked me to refer the matter, and if possible, to recommend the release of his men, and the return of the captured arms. I replied that I did not fcnow the facts of the case, but only remembered that a fairly large capture had been made at or near Shargah last year. Abdul Aziz, whilst naturally disappointed at his arms having been seized, did not show the resentment, which might have been expected, and was exceedingly frank and friendly in the matter, saying that he was not concerned for any other weapons than his own, and made no representations regarding such others as were seized at the same time. He also stated that he was prepared to make any arrangement with us which would permit of his obtaining his requirements in a more or less legal fashion, urging that it must be obvious to us that his position as the Ruler of Nejd, who is periodically compelled to punish the marauding Bedouin tribes necessitated that he should keep himself supplied with adequate military material. He has no desire to sell the arms, or even to permit their sale, except in so far as weapons were required by Nejd30 towns and villages to arm adequately the contingents he called up for service from time to time. His personal request to me was made in a temperate and friendly manner, and the same attitude will be apparent from his letter, except for the few words in which a charge is made against the Residency A?ent at Shargah. I informed Abdul Aziz, at the time, in reply, that all I could do would be to refer the matter for it was entirely outside my jurisdic tion, and I am replying in the same sense to his letter. 3. I have since heard that the men, who were imprisoned have been released, and have returned to Nejd, consequently, only the question of the arms remains. 4 . I have seen the Amir’s agent, Abdul Aziz-al-Aomi, and he tells me that he himself was detained in Hasa, arranging for camels, and that the men with the arms, when captured, stated that they belonged to French dealers in the hope that they would thus escape, as they were aware that British ships did not stop the dhows with French flags which came to Katar. He added that he received the invoice from his brother by post, and that the arms were purchased from several dealers in Maskat, though the majority came from [European shops, whilst a few were obtained from Sohar. He stated that “ Bin Saud ” had taken the invoices sent by his brother, as he required them to ascertain what arms had actually been sent, and what was the number in excess of those he had himself ordered. 5 . The capture is that related in the correspondence sent to me, under your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 2524 , dated the 12 rh October 1912 , and it will be seen that the names of the captured men are the same as those given in the attached letter from “ Bin Saud ”, and if the explanation now given is accepted, there seems no reason to doubt the story, as related in the men’s statement to Abdul Latif on the 2 nd September 1912 , which apparently really applied to a portion only of the consignment. 6. In the circumstances, and seeing that the men concerned have already worked out their punishment, whilst the passage of arms into Nejd would not appear to be a menace to our interests, I venture to recommend that the Amir’s request may be favourably considered. “ Bin Saud ” is inclined to be friendly to us, has always treated me personally with great consideration and frankness, and in view of his offer to make some arrangement regarding arms, I venture to think that it would be politic to meet his present request in ward to his own purchase, if the presence of the arms in Shargah, or elsewhere makes such a course possible. 7. I have the honour to solicit an early decision in order that it may be communicated to the Amir, as soon as possible. Translation of a letter from Abdul Aziz Bin Saud, Amir of Nejd, to Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Ageut, Kuwait, No. 97 , dated the 29 th Rabi-ath-Thani 1331 (3rd April 1913). After compliments .—And after be it not hidden from Your Honour when (there is) between us and you affection and friendship and the prohibition (of evil) to the subjects of your Government who arrive to our side (i. e., terri tories) we protect them and w e do necessary making smooth (of matters for them)and we respect your rights. Accordingly last year we despatched the bearer (of this letter) our servant Abdul Aziz-al-Aomi to buy arms for us and (it was) decreed by God that he should send his brother named Saud in his place wdth two persons with him and they are Mahomed ibn Nafjan and Abdulla bin Ibrahim ibn Abdul Karim, and when they had bought the weapons came upon them Abdul Latif and Ibn Mualla and his” family and took the weapons from them in Shargah territory (at the) end of the month of Ramzan 1330 (September 1912 ) and beyond this imprisoned our above-mentioned men and the details of the arms are those given below. But with respect to the weapons which beloil^ to Maskat, we have notbino- 'to do with them but those which are our own Inshallah you wdll refer (to higher authority) regarding them and will endeavour to obtain them, likewise31 670 release our imprisoned men and if you desire from me a bond and assurance in this matter I am ready for whatever you may wish. The goal (is that) Inshaliah you will support (me) and effect the recovery of the weapons and their carriage to Kuwait and release the prisoners and the weapons may be remain) with Your Honour; and those (men who were) with the vveapons when Abdul Latif and his men seized them, said to them (i.&lt;?., to Abdul Latif, &amp;c.,) that the weapons belong to the Frenchman and according as you know the ways of frightened men when caught, they thought that the Frenchman’s name would release them if they put the arms in his name and we w r ere far from them and the weapons and men were ours and our subjects let there be not the slightest doubt to you in them that the arms (were) specially ours and that the men (were) our servants and Your Honour knows that anything in which there is the smallest suspicion never do we put ourselves therein. This (letter) will reach you by the bearer our servant Abdul Aziz who w r as to take the arms with his brother according to our former intention, he is a knowdedgeahle man and competent and we ordered him not to go to any port except Katar and to inform us of his arrival there and w r e would send transport for the above weapons. But regarding the arms w ith them other than those belonging to us, they belong to a Maskat man, w ith the men who were friends of Saud, by w r ay of “ Batha’a ” sale {Note — Agency business in which the provider of the capital takes two-thirds or half of the profit realised by the working agent). If they suited us we should take them at a price and if not suitable to us they would sell them to Nejd people. With respect to Abdul Latif and Ibn Mualla we have heard that they secreted the weapons and cartridges and made many exchanges in them and certainly no one would bring pressure to bear on them and (Abdul Latif would give) false news so that their story should be believed and they would hide those arms which entered to them (i.e., which they took), the Government would not have knowledge of them and let it not be hidden from Your Honour that we hold dear our self-respect from the proceeding from us of the smallest word of falsehood or calumny and in any case you know our position and our thoughts, by God then (there is) in you and your Government, Imperial and magnanimous, adornment and may the Almighty keep you and safeguard you. * Written 29th Rabi-ath-Tkani 1331.

Cox, K.C.J.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Political Agent, Kuwait. In reply to your letter No. 7 C., of 29th April, I have the honour to explain that the arms captured near $hargah consisted of the following, as reported by His Majesty’s Navy. Carbines 399, Martini-Henry rifles 395, Lee-Enfield rifles 20, Mauser rifles 25. Whereas according to the details given to you by Bin Saud, the arms of which he has suffered the loss were as follows :— Belonging to Bin Saud. Belonging to 70 “ Filsi ” rifles (5-shot magazine). 40 “ Damodari 400 Mauser (Martini-action). 10 revolvers ( 10 -shot magazine). T130 “ Filsi M rifles (5-shot magazine). \ 50 “ Damodari ”. 1 2 u 0 Mauser (Martini-action). Maskat man. / C160 Martinis. It is difficult to reconcile these two statements.

Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In reply to your letter No. 1521, dated the 13th May 1913, I have the honour to reply that Bin Saud’s agent, Abdul-Aziz-al-Aomi, has left Kuwait for Nejd, and, therefore, I am unable to enquire from him the precise nature of the arms said to have been invoiced from Maskat. 2 From a paragraph in the Maskat Political Agency Administration Report for 1911, however, it would appear that by “ Filsi ” is meant a 7 m/m Mauser, 5-shot magazine sporting rifle or carbine, by “ Damodaii ” a similar weapon of 9 m/m bore. “Mauser” I know is generally used to describe a small bore carbine with Martini-action, and I believe “ Damodari ” is occa sionally used for a 10-shot magazine weapon, Lee-Enlield and the like.3 . With these observations, I give below a comparative table in an endeavour to reconcile the figures, I fear without much success :— ft^ a o 4 ) g 5 CD 0 b ~3 m % S a os to a s a U t ° s a *• is d - o Ji u *6 'C a, c - ft) o wo tn •-* t- O- VJ 2.S a *«&gt; g 53 ce 5 = a ft ^ w P Xi cs — S 2 -a As given in Bin Sand’s two lists 200 90 290 600 combined.

In view of recent developments in Hasa it may perhaps be well to allow the matter to lie over, for from all accounts Bin Saud will have no lack of arms and ammunition for some time to come,, as it is reported that he seized the whole of the Turkish reserve stocks, allowing the troops to leave only with the weapons in their hands. When the situation becomes clearer, it may perhaps be found possible to intimate to him whatever Government may be pleased to decide in the matter.uvw'i« SECRET. On March 31st the Criminal Investigation Department reported from Bombay that a certain Amin Izmirlian, an Armenian who has become a naturalised American subject, was suspected of trying to introduce American rifles into the Persian Gulf. He had visited the Gulf during December, 1912. In this connection the American Consul General at Bombay recently communicated to the Bombay Police the fact that some person in India, believed to be Amin Izmirlian, had recently asked an American firm to quote for 7000 U.S. Army Springfield rifles. The possibility of American firms embarking upon Anns Traffic in the Gulf is a serious one.CONFIDENTIAL. 6H No. 1750, dated Bushire, the 1st (received gth) June 1913* From— LlEUTEXANT-COLONEL Sir PERCY COX, K.C.I.E, C.S.I., Pol tical Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your pre decessor’s letter No. M62-X1X-V, dated 30th November 1912 regarding the proposed limitation and registration of arms carried by native cratt. 2. Your Excellency will remember that the proposal emanated from the Senior Naval Officer with primary reference to the pearling fleet ^rl.minary investigation indicated that any regulation specially directed against the pea g fleet would arouse resentment, but l thought we might be ab e o rl &amp; j, comprehensive regulation applicable to all native craft, in which pea g would be incidentally included. The Sultan of Maskat replied that the matter concerned hint very little as pearling dhows from his territory mostly went towards the Red Sea and uer the habit of taking passes. # . , The Trucial Shaikhs offered no objection, and said they would comply, mt the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait, who of course are those primarily concerned, object to the proposed arrangement in the interests of their pearling communities. There have also been some hostile articles in the vernacular press charging us, in connection with the present project, with (il Letter from the Political Agent, Eahrain, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 138, dated 3rd March 1913.

This year the pearling fleets have already started operations, so that no * m 2 further can be done for the time as regards the issue ot P asses ; b, h ’the shall take the first opportunity of discussing the question p y Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait, in the hope of removing their objections. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Government of India. No. 138, dated the 3rd March 1913. From—The Political Agent, Bahrain, Tq...T he Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter No 683 dated 27th February 1913, regarding the issue of passes by the Shaikh to Nakhudas of dhows including pearling dhows belonging to Bahrain.2 4 4 O 8 .d .1 I had an interview with Shaikh Esa on the subject, and though he did not seem very enthusiastic about the matter, he did not seem to raise any particular objection to the idea or to the form of pass except to say that the certifying clause was not very clear. In the end he said he would consider the question and asked me to let him have a letter. Shortly after therefore I wrote to the Shaikh on the lines of your letter No. 282, dated 25,th January and sent him a specimen form of pass. As I got no reply, I sent a reminder and have now received a reply dated 22nd Rabi II, 1331 (= 1st March 1913) a copy of which I annex. It appears that the pearling Nakhudas have objections to the innovation and the Shaikh does not like to overrule them, and that in short the position remains very much the same as indicated by my predecessor in his letter No. 524 dated 25th October 1912. ’ The Shaikh sent off his letter just before going away to the interior ; when he comes back I will interview him again and endeavour to make him see that the present proposal though new does not inflict any particular hardship on any body. In the meantime, as the Shaikh has a rooted objection to appearing in the role of an innovator, it would, I think, help matters if I were in a position to be able to inform him that Shaikh Mubarak sees no objection to the procedure and is introducing it in Kuwait, if he is doing so. I therefore ask that, if you see no objection, you will give me some information on this point. I hear that one of the objections of the pearling Nakhudas is based on the point that it frequently occurs that relief crews or additional hands are sent to the pearling boats during the season, some of whom take weapons, and that it may thus happen that neither the number of the crew nor the number of arms on a pearling boat would towards the end of the season coincide with the number shown on the pass. This the Nakhudas say would appear very suspicious to one of His Majesty’s ships and result in much trouble to themselves. Primd facie there appear to be some grounds for this objection, but I will try and go into this point when I next s^e the Shaikh about the matter. Translation of a letter dated the 22nd Rabi /, /jj/ (=7^/ March 1913)1 from Shaikh Esa bin Alt Al Khalifah, Chief of Bahraini to Major A, P. Trevor, C LE., Political Agent, Bahrain. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your esteemed letter No. 85, dated the 8th Rabi 1 , 1331 (=i5th February 1913) and the one following in its continuation No. 108, dated 21st Rabi I, 133* ( == 28th February 1913) and to say that I have duly understood what you mentioned therein on the subject of my issuing an order warning all Nakhudas of the sailing boats and particularly the pearling dhows who are under my government to the effect that they should take passes from me for the arms and cartridges in their boats. I observe firstly that this is a new order which had not been in force before, and secondly that the boat owners who deal in Ghos business neither pay attention to professions other than the Ghos operations nor do they trade in arms. And if they carry a r ms with them, it is only for the sake of protecting their goods and their lives so that they may not be attacked by the pirates wtio live on their evil operation Notwithstanding this, I have talked to some of the principal men in regard to this affair and they all disliked the matter entirely. I therefore do not approve of putting in force of such a new order from which may rise difficulties and com plications and which may create in the minds of people suspicion and general hatred against my Government. &amp; Usual ending. No. 165, dated the 15th March 1913. From—The Political Agent, Bahrain, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. W ith reference to the last sentence of my letter No. 138, dated vd Marrf 1913 regarding the issue of passes by the Shaikh to the Nakhudas of all dhowibelonging to Bahrain, I have the honour to state that I had another conversation with Shaikh Esa on the subject. 2. He stated that the reason the pearling Nakhudas object to the proposal is that, owing to deaths and desertions or to the arrival of additional hands during the season, the number of hands on board at a given moment might not coincide with the number on the pass. Similarly, though to a less degree, the number of arms might not coincide. Such discrepancies would cause difficulties at an inspection by a man-of-war. 3. He said, however, that if the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Shaikh of Trucial Oman were enforcing the order, that would assist him in enforcing it here. I gathered that he would not object to introducing the innovation if he was in a position to assure the leading pearling Nakhudas that the system of passes was being enforced by other Shaikhs. 4. Having warned him that arms in boats not having passes are liable to C u n ^M C f t * 0n ’ We can ’ ^ proceed and confiscate a certain number until the Nakhudas find that it is to their interest to have passes. At the same time as Shaikh Esa is so conservative and so unable to enforce any orders on the principal Dosiri and other pearling Nakhudas, 1 think it will be advisable to pro ceed slowly, and give him a chance of following the lead of Shaikh Mubarak and other more progressive Shaikhs. No. 2oo, dated the 19th May 1913. From—The Political Agent, Kuwait, T°—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to your letter No. 476, dated the 13th February 1913 relative to pearling dhows and ether craft carrying arms for self-defence being provided with passes sealed by the Shaikh and countersigned by the Political Agent. 2. When your letter above quoted was received Shaikh Mubarak was absent from Kuwait, but before leaving for my tour in the hinterland I explained the matter to Shaikh Jabir and left instructions and copies of the suggested form with the Agency Mulla to represent the matter fully as soon as the Shaikh should return. The Mulla carried out his instructions but the Shaikh took no action before my return to headquarters. He was then seriously ill and I was unable to revert to the subject until he had recovered to some extent by which time the pearling fleet was preparing for the season. When I mentioned the matter the Shaikh said that the Agency Mulla had informed him and he hoped to look into it later but felt too unwell at the moment. I was obliged to postpone further discussion and contented myself with reminding him that the boats would soon be leaving and it was advisable in their own interests that they should carry passes to save themselves from easily avoidable attention from His Majesty’s men-of-war, 3. Some days later I heard from other sources that the Shaikh had ordered all Nakhudas to have their arms stamped before leaving Kuw’ait, and as I had observed some boats already leaving the port, I brought up the matter again at my next visit to the Shaikh pointing out that several boats had already started. He then informed me that he had ordered all arms to be marked and after many asseverations that pearling dhows were much too busy diving to be interested in arms, made the statement (not in seriousness I feel sure) that should any of the pearling fleet be inspected for arms by His Majesty’s ships he would despatch a vessel from Kuwait to collect and return with all their weapons leaving the pearling fleet without any. I then pointed out that marking the arms in no wise helped the Navy in their efforts to avoid molesting boats unnecessarily, that the Navy had no knowledge of tribal marks, etc., and that so far as I could see, the course he proposed seemed to be calculated to give the pearling fleet a maximum amount of trouble besides leaving them defenceless. Our object was solely to provide the pearling boats with a means by which the commanders of His Majesty’s ships could be assured of the bo?id Jides of any particular vessel and thereby limit their investigations within the narrowest compass, with the minimum of annoyance and trouble to all concerned. I explained further that it was4 intended that the measure should be applied to all boats, Bahrain, Oman, etc., as well as Kuwait and that if other boats held passes whilst Kuwait had not, he would understand that His Majesty’s ships would be likely to pay particular attention to those unprovided. The Shaikh merely reiterated assurances that Kuwait boats did not traffic in arms and as he showed no intention of complying with the scheme even at this eleventh hour, I warned him that he could hardly expect us to regard seriously any complaints made by them of being searched when our efforts to make matters easy for them were disregarded. 4. Two days ago l again visited the Shaikh, nearly the whole pearling fleet having left for the banks in the meanwhile, and he then produced the letter to your address which I have the honour to forward herewith, had it read over to me and requested me to forward it with my recommendations for the boats to be left unmolested. I replied I would forward the letter and do what I could _ but I anticipated that while the Navy would be careful to interfere with the diving as little as possible, they would be likely to pay particular attention to boats with out passes 5. From one or two Kuwaitis who have asked me the object of the measure and to whom 1 explained it, I gathered that a few boats in order to avoid suspi cion attaching to them have this year sailed without any arms at all. Conse quently I am inclined to think, if His Majesty’s ships do search several Kuwait boats this season and then release them with a plain warning to the effect that being the first year of the measure the absence of a pass has been condoned but that next year any arms found in a boat uncovered by a pass will assuredly be confiscated, that even if the Shaikh himself still continues averse to the measure next year the Nakhudas will themselves probably apply at this Agency for passes independently. While I am inclined, therefore, to recom mend that some leniency may advantageously be shown, complete immunity of Kuwait boats from search during this season is not calculated to hasten the end desired. Dated nth Jamadi II, I 33 1 (=i8th May I 9 » 3 b From— Shaikh Sir Mubarak es-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait, To—L ieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After Compliments. I be&lt;* to adress Your Honour by way of a request and appeal in regard to my poor subjects engaged in diving, who toil under the greatest difficulty for earning their livelihood and distribute considerable sums amongst the divers coming to them from all parts, *&gt;., from Nejd, from amongst the tribesmen and from Basrah—and who trust to God that he will repay them for what they have invested. Their toilsome work lasts from sunrise to sunset and their custom is diving, their diving banks ranging from Ras-al-Zeir to Jabail and to the south of JabaiT at a spot in sight of the coast. The arms they use for self-defence are specially intended for the divers and their number is equal to one-fourth of that of the crew or even less and they are duly sealed. Only the merchants from amongst them place arms (on board vessels) according to the number of their men. I pray that you will afford your kind regards to them so that they may not be interrupted in their diving because when the man-of-war comes to them, they are interrupted in their business ; they are poor people and will be profited by a single hour during which they n ay fish a shell (mother-o’-pearl). They are, God willing, far from being suspected of (participating in) the arms traffic a nd I am pledged for this. This is what was to be stated and I hope that your attention and considera tions will continue and that you will accept an assurance of my esteem. The command rests with your honour, and may you remain preserved. C28FD—44—13-6*13—GCBP SimlaNo 1752, dated Bushire, the 1st (received gth) June 1913.

NOTICE. To all to whom these presents may come. After the sale of the Bombay Persia Company’s steamers the work of transporting of merchandise was confined to the linglish who having seen obstacles in their way, began to exercise every sort of highhandedness n ^ merchants and passengers, increased the passage by 30 per cent, will doubtless increase it hereafter, and, having felt confident that there is no steamer to rival them, they will use every form of highhandedness and pressure, raise a thousan objections^ delay merchandise, give no answer for shortages, annoy travellers an forcibly charge freight on the travellers’ baggage, which has never been cus om ■ ary It is obvious that this matter involves loss and detriment to all the Mussal- mans, especially my Persian brethren, and more particularly to the respected merchants. Therefore, I have resolved, at the persistent request of my friends, to form a Shipping Company under the patronage of the exalted British Government aiK have fixed its capital at 10 lakhs rupees vtz., 4,000 shares of Rs. 250 each As the principal object in forming this Company is to remove foreign highhandedness and conduce ease to my compatriots, I beg to request a. my respected brethr n that they may, with a view to furthering the cause of philanthropy^ and checkin foreign aggression favourably consider the expediency of participating in and helping this Company, and may intimate to me to enter their honourable names in the book of the shareholders and contributors of this Islamic Company and that they may also write the amounts of their contributions, and state^ as to now many shares of the Company they wish to buy, so that they may be informed in due course and pay one half of the contribution to the Bank at present, and the other half when the work is commenced. When the shares and the rules of t e Company have been printed, the shares will be formally forwarded to every share-holder. They should rest assured that the benefits of this Company are far better and more than all other sorts of trades of to-day and will undoubtedly cause our nation and country to progress. If we reflect with care, it will be seen that the multiplied wealth and the high progress of the Franks have been and are due to the blessings of forming Companies, and we hope that we, the Persians, will also realise the benefits o Company-promoting and attain to high degrees by the providence of God and the enthusiasm of our zealous compatriots through the formation of such Islamic Companies, which are the cause of real union ; we shall thus rise to high degrees and be saved the disgrace of humiliation by foreigners.

XXX X Basrah . It is reported that during the month of December, about 200 rifles were imported into Zubair from Kuwait by land. At present there are 12 Kuwait arms- dealers in Zubair who hire houses by the month and on the completion of the sale of their arms, return to Kuwait for more. The nominal Shaikh of Zubair levies an import tax of 5 Dollars per rifle, and an export tax of 1 Dollar. It is reported that the Shaikh of Kuwait levies an export tax of 4 Dollars per rifle on rifles coming to Zubair or Basrah. 2. About December 20th, the Nakhuda of Kuwait bum was caught by the Customs Officials endeavouring to sell 2 Martini rifles, which he had brought to Basrah from Kuwait. Y/hen the case reached the Local Authorities, one, Abdul Aziz-al-Salim, agent of the Shaikh of Kuwait, requested that the case should be squashed on the ground that this Nakhuda was allowed by the Shaikh to carry these rifles for protection on the high seas. On secret enquiry, however, it was ascertained that this Nakhuda makes a practise of bringing ammunition to Basrah from Kuwait, for sale, and is further reported to pay the export taxes, alluded to above, to the Shaikh of Kuwait. 3. It is reuorted that a broken case was found on board the s.s.'Anatolia ' which had contained arms. On this being brought to the notice of one of the Officers of the ship, he informed the tally-clerk that it was not part of the cargo, and he had it immediately removed. This seems to bear out the suspicion that Officers bring up arms privately and sell them.Extract from the Intelligence Officer Bushire's Arms Traffic diary No.15, from December 24th, 1913, to January 10th, 1914. X X XX Iwuhammareh . Arms are now being smuggled into Muhammareh concealed in bags of rice, and shipped on board the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers at Kuwait. They are accompanied by some person who takes charge of them on arrival at lluhammareh and sees them through the Customs. Two rifles were shipped in this manner on board the s.s.'Baroda ” at Kuwait on December 26th, and landed at Muhammareh on December 2’7th. These rifles were accompanied by one Dand, son of Haji Ghanim of Muhammareh, and were shipped at Kuwait by Haji Muhammad-bin-Yakub and his two sons Jasim and Muhammad of Kuwait. On a previous occasion Dand landed 5 rifles in a similar manner and bribed the Customs Officers £ T3 to allow them through. In the present case he gave no bribe and the Customs Officers allowed him to take the bags not through. It is/definitely known whether they were aware of the presence|of rifles in the bags or not.

Firearms were abundantly brought to Masqat,until six years ago,from France and other countries and were thence taken to Mesopotamia and HiJaz,while some of them made their way to the Indian towns via Gfwadar and Jashk,which are two emporiums on the North,the former being under the :^sqat Government and the latter under Persia^, This led the British Government to prohibit their sale at Masqat and other towns on the Persian Gulf,as she feared that they would reach its Indian towns* Subsequently,she made an agreement with Sultan of Masqat and compelled him to com ply with her orders. But there still remained the question of the French subjects who would not abide by the Sultan’s order and who continued the sale of arms in the Masqat market on the strength of such privileges which they enjoyed according to tho agreement which they had concluded with the late Saiyid Faisal. Britain was compelled,therefore,to negotiate with the French Government in regard to this question and pro longed communications took place between them in this connection,until they ended last month in what is compatible with the British interests and its desires. It appears, however, that merchants of this class derive great advantage 8 from this business and that certain Powers have far-reach ing greed and political ends in Arabia and further that they, consequently,allow their sul^jects to import them (arms) therein from different directions, we have heard that arms-dealero have now turned their attention towards the coast of the $ed sea and that they use to bring large quantities and sell them to the HiJaz Arabs,from whom they find their way into the hands of the Arbbs of ’Iraq and the middle of the Peninsula. Our correspondent at Zufair states that ’Ajaimi As-Sa’aduh has lately imported twenty casescabes full of firearms which had boon purchased by Borne of his men from tho neighbourhoods of Al-lXadlnah,and that i the ^Amir Ibn Rashid eoized them whon they were boincr passed through Hail. We do not know if the existence of arms in the hands of the Arabs is useful for the Government and the country or not # becauoe certain thinkers declare,subsequent to the Tripoli incident,that it would be more advantageous to the Government’s interests than to those of the Arabs if the latter possess arms,while many of the Turks contend that the case of Arabia is different from that of Tripoli,because the former adjoins the capita! and is connected with the other Turkish countries,and further that these arms will always be a great source of blood-shed amongst Turkish subjects in Arabia. Perhaps some thinkers will assist us with their views in this important question.'fzt- )l° A copy of the undermentioned letter ia forwarded, with compliments, to the Political Agent,Kuwait, for in formation, with reference to his letter No. C.14 dated 15th April 1914.

G, Grey, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to reply to your endorsement No. 1023, dated the 7th instant. It is presumed that the point upon which my views are invited is whether the time has or has not arrived to resume the systematic search of Kuwait dhows which may be suspected of carrying contraband arms and ammunition. 2. I would first observe that no case for such resumption appears to have been established either from the events reported in the papers sent with your endorsement or from the contents of the Intelligence Officer’s diaries to which ^ reference is made by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief. The names of the Bum and the Nakhuda are not given by the Intelligence Officer, and the most that could be proved against the Nakhuda appears to be that he attempted to sell two rifles from among those that he is permitted to carry for the protection of his vessel and her crew, which, although an offence and one w-hich would doubtless be punishable by the Shaikh w r ere the case brought before him, scarcely amounts to a definite instance of smuggling arms or a contravention of Sir Mubarak’s undertakings with His Majesty’s Government. In regard to the dhow detained by H. M. S. “ Dartmouth ”, the circumstances in which she was considered to have been suspicious are not fully stated, and they were apparently not sufficiently convincing to enable the Senior Naval Officer to authorise a systematic search on that occasion. 3. H. M. S. “ Fox ” called at this port on 29th ultimo, and I discussed the Intelligence Officer’s reports with the Senior Naval Officer. He informed me that he had no further information in this connection either from the Intelligence Officer or from any other source, and we agreed that it would be sufficient to bring to the notice of the Shaikh that there w'as reason to suspect that Kuwait dhow r s were still concerned in this illicit traffic. I did so, and His Excellency assured me that he had given most stringent orders that nothing more of this kind was to be attempted by his subjects. He suggested that in cases of suspicion, wffiich must of necessity now be of rare occurrence, the Captain of His Majesty’s ship should either place some person on board the dhow to remain there until she arrives in Kuwait as had formerly been proposed, or that the Captain should inform the Political Agent, Kuwait, at once so that the dhow might be watched for and inspected immediately on arrival by one of the Shaikh’s trusted officials accom panied by a representative of this office. His Excellency went on to say that whatever might have been the case formerly he wished us to understand clearly that he was now working hand in hand with His Majesty’s Government in every thing and hoped that w r e would take him at his word. 4. Referring to Sir Percy Cox’s telegram to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, No. 149, dated 7th June 1912, it may be remarked that the majority of the reasons given by him for considering that the alienation of the Shaikh and his community would be particularly undesirable still hold good, and they are strengthened by the addition of our proposed water scheme and the approaching ratification of the Anglo-Turkish agreement in regard to Kuwait. It would obviously be deplorable should the reintroduction of the measure which of all others would tend to produce such alienation synchronise with the event last named. 5. At the same time I do not mean to suggest that any relaxation of vigilance on my part or on that of any one else concerned is to be recommended. I am making continual enquiries in regard to the import and export of arms and ammunition but so far am convinced that with the possible exception of the export of two or three rifles and a small amount of ammunition at rare intervals nothing is at present taking place. 6. In all the circumstances I am of opinion that it would be better to make no change at present in the direction under reference.15^) 3 No. 1202, dated Bushire, the 26th April 1914. From— Major S. G.

The relations between the German Government and the Ham- -burg-Anerika Line are to .ay positive and personal know- -ledge very close indeed.

Would a friendly representation to the German Government be possible ?Extract from Arms Traffic diary No.19 from March 15th to ^ *5 April 30th,1914. Kura it. As a result of certain investigations into the arms traffic at Kuwait,it is reported that Shaikh Mubarak,and one Ha^ji ' Abdo Husain,are to all intents and purposes,in partner ship. The latter makes it his business to find out what kinds of arms and ammunition are most marketable locally,and they are then ordered,in the name of the Shaikh,from Masqat. Husain pays Mubarak Rs.180/- for 1 magazine rifle with 100 rounds of ammunition. Generally speaking arms traffic in Kuwait is impossi ble except through Shaikh Mubarak. If these reports are correct, it would seems that there is almost as much danger in consign ments which are legally imported as in any others. At the present time there said to be roughly 600 rifles,100 Mauser pistols,but very little ammunition in Kuwait. Rifles can be purchased openly in the bazars. Arms are now sent from Kuwait by land,and go mostly to Zubair and Basrah,whence a few go to Baghdad and others to Muhammareh. Hajji Najaf the agent of the Shaikh of Kuwait in Masqat, has taken delivery of 451 cases of ammunition which had been received direct from Europe through the Warehouse. Each case contains 2,500 rounds,and the consignment is to be despatched to Kuwait by the slow mail. It is reported that the Shaikh of Kuwait sent a sum of Rs.40,000 for this ammunition during the early part of March. Jibuti . For some time past there has been a suspicion that Jibuti is,to a very small extent,taking the place of Masqat as a distributing centre. I can get no confirmation of a rumour which has reached rne that Jibuti dhows occasionally find their way up the Gulf,except perhaps in a report recently received from Masqat to the effect that a dhow flying the French flag is suspected of having landed arms on the Makran coast near Chahbar. Information has recently reached me from two independent sources that arms a.re sent f-^on Jibuti to Yanbo f ,and other He^az ports,whence they are sent to Al Kadinah. From there they go Northwards’' ■ '•'raearw (fesiCi Northwards by the Hejaz railway,to some point which I have no 1 been able to ascertain,and thence across the desert to Kuwait and Zubair. In this connection it may be noted that 20 cases of rifles and ammunition are said to have been despatched lately from Al Madinah for Ajaymi,Shaikh of the Kuntakif Arabs. Khilst the consignment was en route it was captured by Ibn Rashid’s men,but was subsequently allowed to proceed owing to and understanding having been arrived at between Ibn Rashid and Ajaymi. It is further stated that 13 II.H.rifles were recently imported into Zubair from Al Kadinah,by one,Bin Gadaan of Kaj ma’ah. Basrah. It is reported that some Arabs from Zilfi,in ITajd, imported 40 rifles into Zubair during the month of February. They are said to have brought these arms from Kuwait.(''*5?

Political Masqat reports tbat Sultan continues to enforce warehouse regulations as conscientiously and effectively as formerly and there is no reason to believe leakage occurs. In his opinion insignificant extent to which illicit traffic now exists justifies discontinuance of blockade. I lately spoke to Colonel Grey at Kuwait who supports Shakespear’s view that case against Kuwait is non proven and in any case I see no possibility of naval blockade enforcing cessation of arms traffic at upper end of the Gulf if shaikh permits illicit sales,as long as we are bound,as T think we are to humour him and Muhammareh by occasional licenses to import arms and especially ammunition in fairly large quantities. The one recent instance that makes me hesitate to recommend immediate discontinuance of blockade is Nicomcdia case. Of itself it is of trifling importance but as possible fore-runner of similar importations in future I cannot but regard it with anxiety. I beg therefore that Government will await my report No.1473 of May 17th amd consider question in light of that correspondence. Reports that reach me of worthless ammunitiorJ'n stores on Trucial Coast and in n rsian Makran encourage me to hope that purchasers are themselves disappointed and that in consequence traffic would of itself show some decline. Every one now wants artini black powder ammunition and rifles which are not easily procured. The general situation in Masqat is now easier and there seems no other reason why our naval strength in the Gulf should not be reduced to modest dimensions of 1907,unless GovernmentGovernment consider German development requires careful watching. Maintenance of Intelligence and Police staff should suffice to watch this phase. I do not share view that there would be serious difficulty in reorganising blockade should this unfortunately prove necessary in future.

One Hajji Mansur,a resident of Mandali, imported six 10-shot magazine and 15 Mauser rifles into Muhammareh from Kuwait about the middle of March,through Hajji Faisal. Hajji Mansur himself stated to my informant that he took them by ballum to the S.S. Nusrat, shipping them by soe | K“ &gt; means which however he would not disclose. They were then taken to Ram Hormuz and sold there. He presented a 10-shot rifle to Hajji Faisal. 2.

An informer reports that a slave of one ’Abud Zayar Ziyab,named *Abd,recently went to Kuwait under instructions from his master to purchase 70 ten-shot rifles. Shaikh Mubarak is stated to have told him that this could not be done without a letter from the Sardar-i-Arfa 1 . *Abd however managed to buy 5 rifles which he brought over in a bum,a nd having landed them at Qasabah,took them to the house of one Hajji Sultan.

With reference to my report in A.T. Diary No. 19 concerning trans-Arabian arms traffic, which has since been corroborated by the Basrah newspaper Sada-ad-Dastur , the Political Agent, Kuwait, reports as follows 'It is said that arms are brought out in German steamers 'presumably of the Hamburg Amerika Line, and landed at the 'port of Yanbo, situated on the Arabian coast of the Red 'Sea rather south of Al-Madinah in latitude. They are thence 'transported by caravan to Hail and other places. I cannot vouch personally for the truth of this report, 'but fcfr® Shaikh Mubarak is convinced that the facts are 'as stated and his information is corroborated from other 'sources. It is believed that this arrangement was inaugur ated nearly two years ago'• I am however of opinion that the supply from this source is very limited.Extract from the Intelligence Officer^ Arms Traffic Diary No. 21 for May 22nd to June 11th 1914. Baghdad . The Germans are reported to have brought a large quantity of arms and ammunition to Baghdad by the new railway (sic) and a man named Ghulam Riza Khaki, who went to Baghdad from Bushire, bought a quantity of rifles ahd cartridges from the Germans and took them to Shushtar and Dizful via t Amareh for sale. He returned to Bushire towards the end of May. I hag have received no confirmation of this report. Now that the Germans have boats on the Karun rjver and have leased a wharf and a godown at Ahwaz, they will have no difficulty in trans hipping arms at Muhammareh from their steamers and sending them up ts. the Karun. Lieutenant E.C.Withers, from recent enquiries made in Bagh dad reports 1. Small consignments of arms and ammunition are frequently brought from Beyrouth via Damascus to Baghdad, by former Turkish post carriers. 2. Considerable quantities of arms are brought overland from Kuwait to Zubair, thence to the Euphrates at Samawah and from there by the Gharaf river to the Kut-al-*Amareh. Numbers of these are distributed to the Arabs in the vicinity of the latter place, and the remaining arms are taken to Baghdad by the crews of the Turkish steamers. 3. Two men, Quli Khan and Wahayad-al-Misri, «[ho are in partner ship, import arras and a considerable quantity of ammunition into Baghdad from the Persian Gulf. These arms are brought up the river in narges with the connivance of the crews of the Turkish steamers, and are sold to the local Arab Shaikhs. The prices of these rifles with 2 dozen rounds of ammunition are from 8 to 10 Liras. These two men were imprisoned about a year ago for arms smuggling, but by giving security and bribes to the Turkish Officials were released after serving 3 months. ItIt ia reported that considerable numbers of* these rifles bear the Masqat Warehouse mark, but I was unable to verify this report. 4. Occasional small consigtaments of rifles and large quantities of ammunition are brought to Baghdad in native craft from Basrah. 5. The Arab tribes in the vicinity of the Tigris from Basrah to Baghdad are well armed with modern magazine rifles. 6. I was informed that there is no difficulty experienced in smuggling arms and ammunition into Baghdad, either by land or by river and all the arms dealers in the bazar have certain stocks of rifles which are kept in some conveniently hidden place•(J 7 ^ !U Extract from the Intelligence Officer's Arms Traffic Diary No. 21 from 22nd May to 11th June 1914. General♦ It is observed that passes for further large quanti ties of arms and ammunition are being granted to Shaikh Sir Mubarak. His Majesty's Government, having regard to larger and more vital interests than arms traffic, de sires that Shaikh Sir Mubarak should receive recognition in this and other ways fxa for his loyalty and valuable offices; but from the humbler standpoint tit arms traffic it would certainly be interesting to learn the ultimate destination of these munitions, and what becomes of the old rifles which are replaced. Every year immense quantities of arms and ammunition are imported into Persia by the Persian Government. That there is trafficking in these no one will deny for an instant^ .

I append an extract from a letter/a friendly Khan on amount of truth there is in it, but it might be worth while to ask the Shaikh to make enquiries. The hopeful sign about the possibility of restoration of order in South Persia is the scarcity of ammunition, it is obvious that we should do all we can to limit its coming into Persia, as the more ammunition comes in the longer will the lawless % elements be able to resist the forces of law and order. , The following is the extract mentioned:- ' x x X x I have h^ard that the boats, which take 'water from the Shatt-al-Arab to Koweit, take ammunition 'on board and transfer it at sea to other boats which may 'desire to purchase it. The men of Koweit, who deal in 'ammunition dispose of their cartridges in this manner, 'while the sane course is being followed by the Koweiti 'fishing boats.

This is a good and advan tageous measure, but it is to be seen what sort of man the inspector is. If he oes not accept bribes and hush-money from those who deal in ammunition, it is likely that smuggling will become less. Is it possible to prevent those who have ammunition at Koweit from selling cartridges by having their ammunitiion seized? For it is impossible that the Shaikh of Koweit should not know what persons stock ammunition in their houses. There seems to be an inexhaustible supply of ammuni tion at Koweit. x ' x x x In my letter of the 2nd Shawwal I wrote that ammunition was being exported from Koweit by the boats, which carry water to Koweit from the Shatt-al-Arab; they hand over the ammunition at sea to those with whom they have made previous arrangements.

Sir P. Sykes has strongly represented the need for stopping the supplies at their sources. So far the Basrah administration does not appear to have taken steps to ascertain the channel of supply, and adopt preventive measTires.
