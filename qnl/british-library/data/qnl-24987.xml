The tribe remained wealthy flock-owners, and gradually increased in power till Mir Ali Khan their chief became Amir of Kain, about the 17th century. His son, Mir Ma’sum Khan, is said to have been ip Nadir Shah’s service, and his grandson Mir Alam Khan is said to be the man who deprived Shah Rukh, grandson of Nadir Shah, of his eyesight at Meshed ia 1748. In the disturbances that subsequently ensued Mir Alam Khan gained power and proclaimed himself Amir of Khorasan but was forced to leave the country by Ahmad Shah Abdali. It is said that he was succeeded as Amir of Kain by Mir Ismail Khan II, the grandfather of Mir Alam Khan III, Hashmat-ul-Mulk father of the present chief of Kain, and of- the present chief of Sistan and Tabas, who died in Meshed in 1891. On his death the title of Hashmat ul-Mulk vras given to his eldest son, Mir Ali Akbar Khan, now Hisam-ud-Dowleh, and a new title Shaukat-ul-Mulk was conferred on his second son. By this the family was split up into two and the power of the old Amir propor tionately reduced. The Persian Government has now dropped the title of Amir and designates the sons as Hukmrans of Sistan and Kain. He had no children and appointed his younger brother, -Mir Muhammad Khan Sartip, his heir. On the death of the above in 1905 Mir Muhammad Ibrahim Khan received the title as well as the Governorship of Kain notwithstanding every endeavour on the part of Hisam- ud-Dowleh to prevent it. He was, however, turned out by his brother in October, 1908 but was re-appointed by the Nationalists in 1909. Is a capable man and most friendly to His Majesty’s Consuls. He is a very pleasant man to talk to and ready to do anything he cam for the English traveller. It was said that he had arranged matters so that the local Majlis supports him, instead of acting against him as is the case with the Governor and local Majlis of most of the other towns of Persia. In 1908 Major Kennion was very anxious that the British Minister at Teheran should try and prevent his dismissal as Governor of Kain, but Hisam-ud-Dowleh’s bribes were too powerful a factor for him. The present Shaukat-ul-Mulk was born in 1884 and is Governor of Sistan. He is the recipient of the O. I. E. In June 1919 he offered to bring troops to oppose! v 55 any Afghan incursion.
