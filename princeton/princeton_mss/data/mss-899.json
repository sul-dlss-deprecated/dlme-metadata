Title from fol. 1a (a later addition in purple crayon). Copied by Molla İbrahim bin el-hac Mehmet Remmah Zade, from Antakya, and completed in Rabīʻ al-Awwal 1164 (1751) -- colophon (fol. 148a). 21-23 lines per page. Written in a very casual small to medium small naskh in black ink with use of red for rubrication. From fol. 1 to fol. 42, the text starts off in one style, with written area more narrow and with more lines per page, after which it changes to less lines and the text is inside a frame outlined in a single line of red ink. After fol. 42 the paper changes too. The script in the first section is slightly larger, but the hand is not substantially different and could still be that of the scribe of the rest of the ms. Catchwords on the verso of each leaf. Glazed European paper with watermarks (some of the paper towards the end of the ms has frame-ruled margins). Several short inscriptions on front pastedown and fol. ia. An oblitarated ownership statement and an obliterated oval stamp on fol. 1a.
