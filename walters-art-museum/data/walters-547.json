The richly decorated surface of this ewer features multiple bands of Arabic inscriptions and scalloped medallions enclosing musicians, enthroned figures, hunters, and other scenes characteristic of medieval Islamic art.  \r\n\r\nThe presence of the artist's signature here is noteworthy since the medieval Islamic artisan generally remained anonymous. Yunus ibn Yusuf styles himself al-naqqash, or decorator, probably signifying that he was responsible for executing the inlaid designs. He also ends his name al-Mawsili, meaning \"from Mosul,\" a famous metalworking center in northern Iraq. However, Yunus ibn Yusuf could just as easily have been working in Syria, where metal workshops produced similar inlaid vessels during the 13th century.\r\n", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1917", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/22888", "Keywords": "container; vessel; pitcher; animals; nature; pattern", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1917, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Mamluk Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:15:21.253", "Creator": "Yunus ibn Yusuf, \"al-naqqash al-Mawsili\" (Iraqi or Syrian)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.456_SideA_DD_T15-tms.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.456_SideA_DD_T15-tms.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.456_SideA_DD_T15-tms.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.456_SideA_DD_T15-tms.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.456_SideA_DD_T15-tms.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1489259, 1489420, 1499705", "ExhibIDs": "320, 13, 3338", "Images": "PS1_54.456_3Qtr_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_54.456_3QtrLft_DD_T15-tms.jpg, PS1_54.456_3QtrRt_DD_T15-tms.jpg, PS1_54.456_Back_DD_T15-tms.jpg, PS1_54.456_Bot_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_54.456_DetA_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_54.456_DetB_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_54.456_DetC_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_54.456_DetD", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Third Floor: Islamic Art"}
