Commercial import figures are greatly higher than in the previous year f s quarter, chiefly due to large and more expensive imports of cotton piece goods, tea, sugar and wheat. India, with Rials 1251,769,000 was the most important exporter to |Persia, principally cotton piece goods, tea, sugar and other tissues and yarns. Imports from the U.3.A. were valued at Rls.57,202,000 anc included 14642 tons of wheat and 2600 tons of metals, presumably steel rails. Imports from . &gt;.S. l» were valued at Rls.51,169,000 and included cotton piece goods to the value «of Rls.36.431,0 0. The United Kingdom exported to Persia goods valued at Rls.9,476,000. Imports of German goods (Rls. 4,122,000) and Japanese goods (Rls.13,232,000) were cleared from Customs in the quarter under review. 3.

Commercial imports show an increase prin cipally due to substantial imports of tea, sugar and cotton, the bulk being supplied by India, who was the biggest exporter to Iran with goods of a value of Rls.170,418,000. Imports from U.3.A. are valued at Rls.19,346,000; and the United Kingdom figures were Rls.7,790,000. In the 1941 figures Germany supplied woollens worth Rls.2,433,000. There are still a few goods from GermaBy and Japan being cleared from Customs. 3. Commercial exports show a decrease owing to no goods having been exported to the axis powers. The most important exports to U.S.A. were opium (Rls.41,150,000, weighing °4 tons), carpets, casings and gum. The United Kingdom purchased Gum Tragacanth, valued at Rls.8,780,000. 6.1 \ 4.

I HA\ E tihe honour to report that the Persian Customs Administration have recently published the annual trade statistics for the financial year 1320, which corresponds to the period from the 21st March, 1941, to the 20th March, 1942. This publication is in Persian. The French edition is expected to be published soon and copies will be sent to you as soon as they are available. 2. Persia’s total foreign trade during this period amounted to 2,659,634,719 rials in value, divided up as is shown in the following table :— ^ ci. a, 1 */ '/c V.A, n.o. «S/ //«&gt;. 120 Imports— Commercial imports ...

The Tehran newspapers remark with satisfaction that in spite of the difficult period covered by the statistics—it includes events liable to interrupt commerce temporarily, such as the Anglo-Russian occupation, after which many importers had to change over from Axis to Allied sources of supply—Persian foreign trade has not suffered overmuch from the effects of the war. 4. In fact this country is in the fortunate position of having considerable stocks of certain goods of which a shortage might have been expected because of the war. On the other hand, there is no more than a semblance of price control. 5. The opportunity which Persian traders have enjoyed until quite recently, of continuing to place orders (and consequently open credits) abroad and of obtaining shipping space for other than essential goods, has had its favourable effect on the exchange situation, counteracting in some degree the heavy expendi ture of the British military authorities and the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation in this country. 6. On the other hand, a system of import control based on that of the Middle East Supply Centre has now been imposed by the Persian Government. It remains to be seen whether Persian trade circles will adjust themselves easily [33—62] ~7Uj A//- ' u. tc C.c /V- 71 to the new conditions, under which they will no longer be able to deal in the more piontable superfluities, but will nevertheless receive every assistance in trading m essential commodities and articles. The gain to the Allied war effort is to be measured by the consequent saving of shipping space.

Commercial imports which again show a decrease, due to the fall of imports from Germany, of 100,000,000 Rials, were somewhat compensated by large imports of sugar, metals, tea and wheat. The heavy fall in exports was due to the total absence of exports to Germany and to Japan, and also a 50,000,000 Rials decrease in exports to U.S.S.R. The United Kingdom, India and U.3.A. showed increases. Shipments of oil show a substantial increase. 3.

A memorandum prepared by the commercial secretary on the foreign trade of Persia during the period is enclosed herewith. 2. Commercial imports show a considerable increase, principally due to important imports from Germany and the resumption of trade with the U.S.S.R. Duty-free imports again show a considerable decrease, chiefly owing to much restricted requirements for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. 3. Commercial exports also show an increase, owing to the very large purchases by Germany, whose share of the total exports amounted to 4t -8 per cent. Oil shipments by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company show a decrease of 1.233,750 tons. 4.

WITH reference to Sir Horace Seymour’s despatch No. 166 E . of the 11th May, 1939, I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship, under separate cover, one copy of the Tableau general issued by the Iranian Customs for the nine months the 22nd June, 1938, to the 21st March, 1939. It is obvious that the calculation of the economic year June to June, introduced in 1931, has now been abandoned, and the Persian year, March to March, is to be adopted again. A memorandum prepared by the commercial secretary on the foreign trade of Iran during the period is enclosed. 2. Both commercial imports and exports, exclusive of oil, show a decline, when allowance is made for the three months short, as compared with the previous twelve months. The adverse balance is, however, considerably less, the figure being only £1,220,293 as compared with £3,712,500 in 1938. 3. Duty free imports of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company amounted to the impressive figure of £7,320,315, of which £6,379,300 were from the United Kingdom. Exports of the company’s oils are valued at £16,220,100. 4.

THE Customs Tableau general published in the first week of March 1940 gives statistics for nine months, so presumably the Customs are reverting to the Iranian year and giving up the economic year which was adopted in 1931.

Imports from the U.S.S.R, amounted to 90,938,163 rials (£1.129,667) representing 16-2 per cent, of the total compared with 32-5 per cent, in the previous year.

Soviet imports have been greatly affected by the absence of a trade agreement since June 1938. The principal imports were: sugar, 33,663,200 rials; heavy metal ware, 15,434.000 rials; and cotton piece-goods, 11,889,500 rials (£147.645).

The United States of America imports show a decided decrease to 28.092.825 rials, due to restricted imports of automobiles. Only 407 lorries, valued at 8.169.910 rials; 151 cars, 2,639,640 rials; and tyres and tubes valued at 6,781,980 rials were imported. All these figures are well under half the imports during the previous twelve months. Of Japanese imports amounting to 27,108,020 rials, cotton piece-ooods accounted for 23.141,970 rials (£287,478). Imports, duty free and commercial imports : — The total value of duty free imports is given as 623,895,462 rials (£7,750.250), of which 589,285,462 rials (£7,320,315) represent imports by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the chief suppliers being the United Kingdom. 513,532,720 rials (£6,379,290), mostly pipes, heavy iron-ware, machinery and constructional material : the United States of America supplied automobiles, machinery and spare parts to the value of 39,678,236 rials (£492,900); India'exported to the value of 17,796,500 rials (£221,075); Germany 5,702,450 rials and Iraq 4,173,620 rials. Koweit, Japan, Sweden, Belgium and Holland also supplied the company on a smaller scale.3 United Kingdom. The share of the total duty fi*ee imports from the United Kingdom amounted to 515.318,050 rials (£6,401,342). The value of total imports therefore amounts to 558,231,422 rials (£6,934.551), or 46-2 per cent, of the total of commercial and ^ duty free imports. Germany. Commercial imports and duty free imports amounting to 22,437,688 rials, total, 236.414,810 rials (£2.936.830), or just over 19 per cent. U.S.S.R. The Soviet Union total imports amounted to 93.326,240 rials (£1.159,330), or 7 • 8 per cent. India. Total of all imports amounted to 74,022,800 rials (£919.538), or 6-2 per cent. J a fan.

Exports to the United Kingdom amounted to 50,723,800 rials (£630,110) representing 10-9 per cent, of the total, and compare favourably with 41,970,800 rials in the previous twelve months. Carpets, lambskins and almonds were the principal exports. India also showed an increase with 32,624,200 rials (£405,270). Germany easily heads the list with 205,828,800 rials (£2,507.190), 44-4 per cent, of the total. Dried fruits, raw cotton, casings, carpets, gum tragacanth and wool were the chief exports. Exports to the Soviet Union, excluding the Caspian Fisheries, dropped to the meagre figure of 25,644,750 rials (£318,570), or only 5-3 per cent, of the total. The decreased demand for carpets caused a fall in exports to the United States, the total being 33,388,900 rials (£414,760) or 7-2 per cent, of the total. Exports to Japan were apparently only 937,575 rials, of which cotton and gum tragacanth accounted for 897.370 rials. No opium is shown, though 972 chests were shipped on the 2nd December, 1938, on the Akagisan Maru, declared as for the Far East, but said to be for Macao.

My Lord, With reference to Mr. Eden's despatch of the 4th November 1936 (No. 14409/92/50), and Sir Horace Seymour's despatch No. 339 E of the 28th October, 1939, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith a quarterly return, extracted from the monthly Customs Bulletins,- of Iranian imports and exports during the three months from the 23rd June to the 23rd September, 1939, with comparative figures for the previous year. 2. Imports were about Rials 5,000,000 less than in the similar period of 1938, the Soviet Union figures being greatly decreased. Exports increased, thanks to considerable shipments to Germany and Japan, and the meagre exports to the U.S.S.R* The Japanese figures in the month 24th August to 23rd September 1939 include about 3,000 tons of cotton, valued at Rials 16,817,000 which is about five times the cotton exports in the two previous months. 3. A copy of this despatch and its enclosure is being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade, and to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department.

Imports show a decrease, chiefly due to the diminishing trade with the U.S.B.H., while exports have, in general, impi'oved in spite of the very large fall in Soviet purchases. All the raw cotton (a total of about 4770 tons) during the uarter went to Germany anu Japan.

WITH reference to Mr. Butler’s despatch No. 174 E. of the 2nd May, 1938, I have the honour to transmit to you, under separate cover, three copies of the Tableau g&amp;ieralQ issued by the Iranian Customs for the economic year from the 22nd June, 1937, to the 21st June, 1938. A memorandum by the commercial secretary on the foreign trade of Iran during the period is enclosed. 2. Imports show a considerable increase, but exports, excluding oil, show a decline as compared with the previous year. As usual, a substantial favourable trade balance is shown if exports of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are included, but an adverse balance of about £3,712,500 is shown with regard to “commercial” imports and exports, as compared with the adverse balance of £2,341.438 in 1937. 3. About 57 per cent, of the “ commercial ” imports and about 65 per cent, of “commercial” exports represent trade with the U.S.S.R. and Germany. 4. Imports from the United Kingdom, exclusive of duty-free imports, show an increase over the previous year’s figures, principally due to shipments of gold. Imports from India show a decline owing to a considerable drop in tea imports. 5. Imports of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, duty-free, amounted to about £4,498,100, of which £4,133,950 was from the United Kingdom. 6. Exports of the company’s oil, valued at about £23,319,300, show an increase of nearly £4 million. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, to the Governor of Burma, to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad, and to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire.

Rate of conversion for both years was 80-50 rials to £. Imports. 01 _ .oFni^ merC , ial im P° rts from the U.S.S.R. m 1937-38 are valued at 31o,43o,824 rials (£3,918,457), or 32-5 per cent, of the total of such imports- Germany, with 247,194,475 rials (£3,070,739), supplied 24-4 per cent. These two countries therefore furnished about 57 per cent, of the total commercial imports. Principal Soviet imports were: cotton piece-goods, 112.806,742 rials- sugar, 81,471,890 rials; and metals and hardware, 47,175,460 rials Duty-free imports amounted to 4,119,700 rials, or about £51.176, the bulk being for requirements of the Caspian Sea Fisheries. Imports from Germany included metals and hardware, 68,106,020 rials; machinery, 59,294.410 rials; woollens ^5,739,000 rials. Duty-free imports amounted to 52,115,120 rials 1^647,400) consisting chiefly of machinery and iron and steel hardware. S n l^ d Stat ^ S of America im P or ts amounted to 83,048,340 rials (£1,031,656), the motor business accounting for the bulk as follows : 1.320 lorries • V n 7«d aon 37 i 223 n 5 ^ 7 als; - 387 CarS ’ 5 ’ 834 ’ 260 rials; and tyres and tubes! 20,/84,490 rials. Duty-free imports totalled 21,760,740 rials (£270 320) the bulk representing automobiles and heavy metal ware for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (Limited). lm P orts fl y ri the United Kingdom amounted to 79.397,868 rials (£986,309), including gold bars of a value of 12,280,285 rials. This shows an increase over the previous year’s imports (65,879,920 rials, or £818.385) even after deduction of the bar gold. Apart from the gold, the principal imports were: cotton piece-goods, 28,784,220 rials; machinery, 6,664,640 rials; woollens and mixtures, 4,461,o00 rials; metals and hardware, 4,204,700 rials- tvres and tubes, 4,141,000 rials. Duty-free imports by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company amounting to 362,098,600 rials (£4,498,120), included 332 783 000 rials (£4,133,950) from the United Kingdom. Commercial and duty-free imports from the United Kingdom total 412,181.000 rials (£5,120,200) and repreint 29 5 cent, of the total imports, compared with the U.S.S.R.’s 22-9 per cent and Germany’s 21-5 per cent. r Due to a large drop in imports of tea India’s commercial imports at 1 4,215,1/2 rials (£921,92/) show a decline of 15,330,000 rials. Cotton piece-goods however, show an increase from 6-9 million rials to 11 - 6 million rials. Duty-free imports amounted to 3,587,000 rials, practically all for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Japanese imports at 32,157,500 rials are about 1-5 million rials less than in the previous year. An increase in the case of cotton piece-goods is offset by losses principally in cement and tea. Tables showing the value of commercial imports from the principal exporting countries are attached.i '6 Exports. (A) Mineral Oils .—The value of oil exports of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company increased from 1,557,926,370 rials (£19,353,123) to 1,877,202,430 rials (£23,319,285).

Germany’s share of exports in 1938 being 29-1 per cent., these two countries took just over 65 per cent, of the exports. The principal exports to the U.S.S.R. were cotton, 78 • 9 million rials; lambskins, 36-1 million rials; rice, 25-3 million rials; almonds, 15-6 million rials; gums, 15 -5 million rials and wool, 13-3 million rials. Germany took wool and goat’s hair, 52-7 million rials; casings, 32-8 million rials; hides and skins, 26-6 million rials; carpets, 20 1 million rials; gums, 14-3 million rials, cereals, cotton, dried fruit and opium. Exports to the United States amounted to 55,148,584 rials, the bulk of which represented carpets. United Kingdom figures fell from 60-3 million rials to 41 -9 million rials, which included 20-3 million rials of carpets, as compared with 34-8 million rials last year. Exports to India improved slightly from 28 1 million rials to 31-4 million rials. Exports of opium valued at 24 5 million rials just about doubled the exports to Japan. The following table shows the figures of the principal exports in the last two years (the 22nd June, 1936, to the 21st June, 1938) : Carpets Dried fruits Raw cotton ...

Both imports and exports in the period under review show considerable decreases. Imports from the five principal countries fell heavily—except in the case of India, but the increase here shown is mainly due to higher valuation of tea, the actual quantity imported being less than during the similar period last year. 3. The decrease in exports, exclusive of oil, is mainly due to a fall in exports of carpets of 13,806,530 rials, or about £172,580. 4. Out of the five principal countries only the United Kingdom improved its position as an importer from Iran. This was due to large shipments of hides and skins. 5. It is interesting to note the diversion of cotton exports to Germany instead of to the Soviet Union, presumably owing to the expiry on the 21st June, 1938, of the Irano-Soviet Trade Agreement. 6.

A memorandum by the acting commercial secretary to this Legation on the foreign trade of Iran during the above period is enclosed herein. 2. The figures of both imports and exports have increased, and the adverse balance of “commercial” trade amounts to £2,341,438, as compared with £1,810,360 in the previous year. 3. Imports from the Soviet Union and Germany represented over 50 per cent, of the total commercial imports, and exports (exclusive of oil) to these two countries accounted for about 60 per cent, of total commercial exports. 4. Commercial imports from the United Kingdom show a considerable drop compared with figures for the previous year, due chiefly to German competition, which enjoyed the facilities afforded by the Irano-German payment clearing agreement. ' Even if the duty-free imports are taken into account—about 140-5 million rials from the United Kingdom and about 36 million rials from Germany— total imports from the United Kingdom were about 20 million rials less than the German total. 5. Imports from India show a considerable increase, thanks to large imports of tea, whilst Japan lost ground owing to greatly decreased imports of cotton piece-goods. 6. Oil exports by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were considerably more than during the previous year, the sterling value showing an increase of £4,423,962. 7.

WITH reference to Mr. Butler’s despatch No. 180 E. of the 11 th April, 1936, I have the honour to transmit to you, under separate cover, three copies of the Tableau general issued by the Iranian Customs Administration for the economic year the 22 nd June, 1935, to the 21 st June, 1936,0 together with a memorandum by the acting commercial secretary on the foreign trade of Iran during that period. 2. Imports, both commercial and non-dutiable, have increased considerably, the total being about 206 million rials (£2,370,450) above the previous year’s figure. The increase is due principally to larger imports of machinery, railway material, metals, cement, cotton piece-goods, woollens and mixtures, wearing apparel, haberdashery and motor lorries. 3. Ordinary exports show an increase of about 133 million rials (£1,530,500), but Anglo-Iranian oil shipments were down by 100 million rials (£1,157,170). The figures for commercial imports and exports, exclusive of oil shipments, show an adverse trade balance to Iran of 156 • 3 million rials (£1 * 8 million), as compaied with the adverse balance of 90-5 million rials (£ 1-2 million) in the previous year. 4. Imports from the Soviet Union show an increase, and represented 30 per cent, of the total commercial imports. Cotton piece-goods to the value of £932.700, representing 50 per cent, of the total, were imported. An adverse trade balance to Iran of 41 -5 million rials, about £478,700, is now shown m place of the favourable balance last year of some £342,000. 5. Both imports from and exports to the United Kingdom showed substantial increases, imports of cotton goods and woollens showing satisfactory improvement. Excluding bullion and oil shipments and non-dutiable imports, a trade balance of 3-2 million rials (£36,900) in favour of the I nited Kingdom is revealed. Non-dutiable imports (the origin of which is not shown in the tableau) by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company amounted to 190,477,730 rials (£2.193,685); most of these imports were presumably of British origin. 6 . Trade between India and Iran was almost the same as last year as regards imports, while exports to India increased by nearly 4 million rials (£44,400). 7. The Irano-German clearing agreement and the control of exchange practically doubled the trade between the two countries, and at the 21 st June, 1936, Iran was left with an adverse balance of 37-5 million rials (£432,000). Machinery and railway material swelled the imports, and sheep casings, wool, dried apricots, gum and hides increased the exports. 8 . The United States retained their position of biggest seller of automobiles and accessories, and the best buyer of carpets. 9. Japanese imports of cotton piece-goods represented nearly 32 per cent, of the total Against total imports valued at 78,274,600 rials (£901,470), exports to Japan only amounted to 8,200,000 rials (£94,440), opium and gum tragacanth accounting for practically the whole amount. 10.

The adverse balance of “ ordinary ” imports and exports in 1936 was 156-3 million rials (£1-8 million), as compared with 90-5 million rials (£ 1-2 million) in the previous year. Exports. (A) Mineral Oil Exports. Exports of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (Limited) were valued at 1,296,298,979 rials (£14,929,160), which is nearly 100 million rials less than in 1934-35. The sterling value, owing to the depreciation of the rial, shows a fall of about £3-75 million. The principal countries of destination were :— Million Rials. £ United Kingdom ... 550 (6,334.000) Egypt 235 (2.706,000) Aden 95 (1,094,000) South Africa 82 (944,000) India 68 (783,000) Australia 62 (714,000) (B) Other Exports. Including exports of the Caspian Sea Fisheries, exports to the U.S.S.R. amounted to 199,542,484 rials (£2,298,082) which represented 30-2 per cent, of total exports, excluding A.I.O.C. shipments. In the previous year, with 223-6 million rials (£3,116,700), the Soviet Union absorbed 41-8 per cent, of total exports (exclusive of oil). Decreases are noticeable in exports of cotton (17-7 million rials), rice (4-2 million rials), wheat and barley (4-1 million rials), and gum tragacanth (2 million rials). Exports of live-stock rose from 166,079 head (12-4 million rials) to 307,861 head (20-9 million rials, about £241,450). Exports to the United Kingdom, excluding oil, and shipments of silver amounting to 51,020,980 rials (£587,596), showed the substantial rise of 31 million rials (£360,288) from3 50-4 million rials (£670,000) to ^Bl -? million rials (£940,940), the principal increases being in almonds, gum, hides and cereals. Exports to India were about 4 million rials (£44,400) more than last year. Exports to Germany amounted to 82,694,655 rials (£952,374) as compared with 44,444,459 (£589,590) in 1934-35, the increase being chiefly in sheep's casings, wool, dried apricots, gum tragacanth and tanned hides. Exports to the United States of America were practically the same as last year, the increase in carpets being counterbalanced by a fall in exports of sheep s casings. Exports to Japan were slightly less, opium and gum tragacanth accounting for almost all the amount, which was only a little over 8 million rials (£94,440). Carpets remained the principal export (after A.I.O.C. oil) with a value of 121,192,000 rials (£1,395,740), an increase of nearly 6 million rials over the figures for 1934-35. Cotton comes next with 65,618.000 rials (£755,700) followed by almonds, 49,325,000 rials (£568,060), wool, 43,952,000 rials (£506,180), gum tragacanth, 32,803,000 rials (£377,780) and rice 23,164.000 rials (£266,770), skins and hides, cereals, dates, dried fruit and live-stock. Imports from the U.S.S.R. rose from 193,048,667 rials (£2,586,000) to 241,108,031 rials (£2,777,000), representing 30 per cent, of the total commercial imports. The increase is due to heavier imports of cotton piece-goods, 81,987,350 rials (£932,710), representing 50 per cent, of the total (163,185,000 rials) ; sugar, 57 6 million rials (£664,130) against 29-2 million rials; cement, 23*3 million rials (£268,500) against 13-5 million rials; machinery, wool, metals, &amp;e. Imports of oil products continued to decline. Including exports of the Caspian Sea Fisheries and excluding duty-free imports, trade between Iran and the U.S.S.R. shows an adverse balance to Iran of 41-5 million rials (£478,700) as compared with a favourable balance of 25-5 million rials (£341,700) last year. Dutiable imports from the United Kingdom amounted to 84,905,341 rials (£977,834) compared with 51,995,994 rials (£696,770) the previous year. Duty-free imports were valued at 225.596,796 rials (£2,598,143) of which 190,477,734 rials (£2,193,685) imported by the A.I.O.C., the bulk of which probably was of British origin. Imports of cotton piece-goods increased about 3-5 million rials (£40,100) whilst woollens, at 6 6 million rials (£76,240) were more than double the previous figures. India and Japan participated in the general increase in imports of cotton goods, the figures showing improvements amounting to about 3-2 million rials (£36,860) and 11-6 million rials (£133,640) respectively. The United States of America as usual supplied the bulk of the motor trade, though forty Leyland and forty-five Bedford lorries improved the British figures. Thanks to the Irano-German Payment Clearing Agreement and the control of foreign exchange trade in both directions between the two countries was almost doubled. The chief imports were machinery, railway material and haberdashery. An adverse balance to Iran of 37-5 million rials (£432,000) was the result.'

Comparative figures for the preceding three months, and for the correspond ing three months of last year,are also given. 2 . ija compared with the corresponding period of last year,the returns show a decrease in imports from the united Kingdom arid Japan, and an increase in imports from G-ermany# Imports of cotton piece goods from the united Kingdom increased considerably ,wix;h corresponding decreases in imports from Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Hepublics* British woollens also made further progress,but not so much as those from Germany and Japan, 3 . Exports to the Soviet Ui ion were higher,particu larly raw cotton and livestock. Germany took large quantities of carded wool; this raoy be due to the fact that raw wool is mainly earmarked for the Soviet union. Sxports of carpets to the United Kingdom increased,probably to forestall the carpet monopoly. 4 # i am sending copies of this despatch to the Depart ment of overseas Trade .unnumbered,and to the Foreign Secretary to the Govermaeiit of India o.78.

The statistics show a slight decrease in commercial imports, whilst non- dutiable imports, at 174,822,178 rials (£2,342,519), were nearly double the value in rials of similar imports in the previous year, mainly due to heavy imports by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and for Government requirements. Imports of gold, valued at 44,532,423 rials (£596,709), were considerably less than the abnormal amount of 143,480,553 rials (£1,783,000) in 1933-34. 3 . Exports show healthy increases in commercial merchandise and shipments of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company as well as of the Caspian Sea Fisheries. 4. Excluding oil shipments and non-dutiable imports (including gold), an adverse balance to Iran of 69,763,913 rials (£934,800) is revealed, as compared with an adverse balance of 139 million rials (£1,732,000) in the previous year. 5. The Soviet Union regained ground lost in the previous years, her share of the total trade, exclusive of exports of oil, rising from 20 per cent, to over 30 per cent. She captured, chiefly at the expense of Japan, the United Kingdom and India, nearly 55 per cent, of the cotton piece-goods market. 6 . Imports from the United Kingdom amounted to 94,810,000 (£1,270,394), including 42,810,560 rials (£573,637) of gold bars. Commercial imports fell from 63 million rials (£783,100) to 52 million rials (£696,757), accounted for by the drop in imports of cotton piece-goods. 7. The origin of non-dutiable imports is not shown in the Tableau general, but, as such imports by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company alone amounted to nearly 140 million rials (£1,873,550), actual imports from the United Kingdom must have exceeded imports from the Soviet Union, whose “commercial” imports are shown as 193 million (£2,586,743). Trade between the United Kingdom and Iran, exclusive of gold and non-dutiable imports and of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s oil shipments, resulted in a small adverse balance to Iran of 1,581,000 rials (£21,185). 8 . Imports from India and Ceylon dropped from 64-4 million rials (£805,000) to 57-6 million rials (£771,860) : Germany and Japan also lost ground, whilst the United States of America figures rose partly owing to increased imports of automobiles. 9.

Exports to tftVn im K ' n g dora dropped from 56 million rials (£696,070) to 50 million (£670,000), which represented 9-8 per cent, of the total. Indian purchases were practically the same as the United Kingdom’s in both years Exnorts tntVZZl ell from 77 million rials (£957,100) tf 59 million (£^90 leO) ca^ decrease of nearly 19 million rials (£254.600). A drop in exports of cotton amounting to 22 million rials (£294,790) reduced exports to Germany from 66million (£884,370) to 44 million rials (£589,580). The Japanese share of the export trade diminished from 12-5 million rials (£155,370) to 9 million (£122.000). In spite of a drop from 140-7 million rials (£1,748,900) to 115-3 million (£1,544,900), carpets were still the most important Iranian export after oil products. Cotton, 95 million rials (£1,272,900), comes next, followed by raw wool 29 million rials (£388,600), lambskins 28 million (£375,200), gum Tragacanth 25 million (£335,000), rice 24 million (£321,600), sheep casings, raisins, almonds, fish, opium and raw hides. Commercial imports from the Soviet Union, valued at 193 million rials (£2,586,000) and representing nearly 30 per cent, of the total, show an increase of 47-8 million rials (£640,090) over last year's figures. Cotton piece-goods, up to 73 million rials, were practically double her imports in the previous year. Sugar imports, at 29 million rials (£390.930), improved by 12-5 million rials (£167,500). Mineral oils show a slight increase; railway material was only slightly under 2 million rials (£26,800) as compared with 36 • 6 million (£ 490 , 426 ) in 1933-34, when the large order for rails was delivered. The trade balance between Iran and the Union, exclusive of non-dutiable imports, was in favour of Iran to the extent of 4-8 million rials (£64,300), or, with Caspian Fisheries exports, 25-5 million rials (£341,700). Commercial imports from the United Kingdom, exclusive of gold and non-dutiable imports, amounted to 52 million rials (£696,770), as compared with 63 million (£783,090) in 1933-34. The drop is accounted for by a decrease of 12 million rials (£160.800) in cotton piece-goods. India lost nearly 6 million rials (£80,400) in cotton piece-goods, whilst Japan suffered to the extent of about 24 million rials (£482,400), presumably due to the control by the Cotton Monopoly Company at Tehran. The United States increased their exports of automobiles from 34 million rials (£422,500) to 37 million (£495,800) and spare parts from 13-8 million (£171,530) to 22-8 million (£305,000). Imports from Germany declined by about 5 million rials (£67,000), losing ground on machinery, railway material, colours and dyes, but importing a lot of miscellaneous goods. Imports of cotton yarns dropped further to 5-2 million rials (£69,680), of which India supplied 4 million rials worth (£53,600). Imports of all wool textiles fell from 13-3 million rials (£165,320) to 10 million (£134,000), of which the United Kingdom exported 3-1 million (£41,540), Belgium 2-2 million (£29,480), Italy 2-1 million (£28,140) and France 1 ■ 4 million (£18,760).

Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir John Simon.—(Received May 7.) (No. 166 E.) . Tehran, April 13, 193o. WITH reference to my predecessor’s despatch No. 276 of the 1st June last, I have the honour to transmit to you under separate cover three copies of the Tableau-General issued by the Iranian Customs Administration for the economic year June 1933 to June 1934,together with a memorandum by the commercial secretary on the foreign trade of Iran during that year. 2. The statistics show a large apparent increase in imports, hut this is due mainlv to imports of gold bullion valued at 143 million rials (about £1,783,000) and to increased imports on account of concessionnaires, mainly the Anglo- Persian Oil Company (Limited). If these items are not taken into consideration, the excess of 4t commercial ” imports over exports of Iranian produce, excluding mineral oil, still amounts to 139 million rials (about £1,732,000), as compared with an adverse balance in the preceding year amounting to 89,500,000 rials (about £910,000). The increased adverse balance is due mainly to a falling off of exports in terms of rials, although in terms of sterling exports actually increased. 3. Imports from the United Kingdom increased from 104 million rials (about £1,058,000 at the average rate of exchange for 1932-33) to 137 million rials (£1,706,350). Of this amount, only 63 million rials, or less than one-half, represents ‘ ‘ commercial ’ ’ imports, the balance consisting of goods imported en franchise mainly on account of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited). 4. Soviet imports into Iran fell sharply, particularly those of cotton piece- goods, sugar and mineral oils, and exports to the Soviet Union were also smaller. The Soviet share of Iran’s foreign trade (excluding exported mineral oil) fell to about 20 per cent,, which is the lowest percentage since 1922-23. Imports from Japan, mainly of cotton piece-goods, showed a further considerable increase, and German imports were also higher. 5. Copies of this despatch, with its enclosures, are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade, No. O.T. (B) 76; the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.

THE following table, based on statistics published in the TaMeau-General for 1935, shows the general position of imports and exports during 1933-34, and a comparison with the preceding year : Total imports Exports of Iranian produce, excluding mineral oils and fishery products Mineral oil exports Total exports (FIote .—Average rate of exchange, 1933-34 : 80 45 rials equals £1; average rate of exchange, 1932-33 : 98 -27 rials equals £1.)

Imports en franchise, on account of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company and other concessionnaires, as well as the Diplomatic Corps, amounted in 1933-34 to 92,761,298 rials as compared with 45,913,465 rials in 1932-33. Deducting these amounts, as well as the gold bullion imported, from total imports, the net or ‘‘commercial” imports were 605,494,499 rials in 1933-34 and 611,665,090 rials in 1932-33. The adverse balances, according to this method of calculation, were respectively 139,369,252 rials (£1,732,370) and 89,624,074 rials (£912,020) in 1933-34 and 1932-33. This method of calculation, which is the usual one adopted by Iran, omits the most important of all exports, viz., mineral oils, and if this item were included, a favourable balance of trade for the year amounting to 1,197,571,748 rials (£14,885,910) was achieved. Exports. (A) Mineral Oil Exports. Exports of mineral oils were valued at 1,336,941,000 rials, an increase over the previous year of 193,941,000 rials. The principal countries of destination were the I nited Kingdom, 546 million rials; Egypt, 221 million rials; and France, 110 million rials. (B) Other Exports. Exports to the Soviet Union again declined from 126-5 million rials in 1932-33, or 24 -2 per cent, of total exports, to 90 -2 million rials, or 19-3 per cent, of total exports. In 1931-32 exports to the Soviet Union amounted to no less than 267 million rials, 37 per cent, of the total. The United States figure was fairly well maintained at 77-3 million rials (16-6 per cent.) against 83-5 million rials (16 per cent.) last year, carpets accounting for 59-5 million rials. Exports to the ETiited Kingdom fell from 71 million rials (13-6 per cent.) to 56-5 million rials (12-1 per cent.), and those to British India were about the same- fib-6 million rials (12-1 per cent.) against 55-7 million rials (10-7 per cent.) last year. Germany was a better customer than last year, accounting for 66 • 3 million rials (14-2 per cent.) against 43 million rials. Excluding mineral oils, carpets were again the main export item, but their value declined from 181 million rials to 140-7 million rials, the principal customers again being the United States (59-5 million rials), United Kingdom (26-5 million rials) and Turkey (19-8 million rials). There was an increase, from 44-8 to 80-5 million rials, in exports of raw cotton, which went mainly to Germany, 33-4 million rials; Soviet Union, 28 million rials; and Japan, 12 million rials. Exports of dried fruits, for the stimulation of which heroic efforts continue to be made by the Iranian Government, further declined from 57-9 million rials to 44-1 million rials, of which 33-4 million went to British India. In any trade discussions between British India and Persia, this item would be a useful one to remember. Exports of hides, skins and furs improved, but those of live animals decreased. Rice exports were also lower, while opium exports declined from 33 million rials to 9-17 million. Imports. Imports from the Soviet Union showed a further decline, notwithstanding the trade agreements effected with that country, from 207 million rials (31-5 per cent, of the total) to 147 million rials (21 per cent.). As all trade agreements between Iran and the Soviet Union in the last few years have been based on a more or less exact balancing of imports against exports, it is interesting to note that in the year under review the adverse balance to Iran was approximately 55 million rials, and last year 85 million rials. Total imports from the United Kingdom amounted to the surprising figure of 280-7 million rials, but this presumably includes most, if not all, of the gold bullion imports valued at 143-48 million rials. British imports should, therefore, be shown at approximately 136 million rials (19-48 per cent.), of which 63 million rials represent “com mercial ” imports and 73 million rials duty free imports, mainly for the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. British India’s share of the import trade*further declined from 74 million rials to 64-4 million rials, which includes 3-1 million rials fromCeylon. Japan increased her imports from 52 million rials to 82 million rials (11*7 per cent.), of which 65-3 million rials represented cotton piece-goods and 8-2 million rials cotton yarns; in exchange, Japan imported from Iran goods to a value of only 12-5 million rials, consisting almost entirely of raw cotton, so that the adverse balance to Iran was 69-5 million rials. Japan’s failure to take up opium from Iran during the year must have been a source of disappointment to the Iranian Government. German imports increased from 55 million rials to 70 million rials, the largest single item being machinery valued at 17 million rials. Imports from the United States were higher at 58-3 million rials, of which 52 million rials represented motor vehicles, spare parts and tyres. There was no check to Japanese inroads into the cotton piece-goods market, sales increasing from 32-9 to 65-3 million rials. Soviet imports show a corresponding decrease, from 71 • 3 to 36 • 6 million rials. Imports from the United Kingdom fell from 32-6 to 23-5 million rials, and those from British India from 12-9 to 10-9 million rials. Italian imports suffered even more severely, falling from 14 1 to 3 million rials. It is quite possible that when the Cotton Goods Import Monopoly Company has had more experience, a serious attempt will be made to stem the tide of imports from countries which buy little or nothing in Iran, and in that eventuality Japanese imports of cotton goods will decline, if they have not already begun to do so. Imports of cotton yarn from British India further declined from 16-4 to 12-6 million rials, and those from Japan from 17 to 8-2 million rials. United States supremacy in the automobile trade was even more marked than previously, and the recent improvement shown by the United Kingdom in this line was not maintained, Germany importing trucks to a higher value. Germany led the field in imports of industrial machinery with 17 million rials, followed by Czechoslovakia (11-3 million rials), United Kingdom (5-4 million rials) and Sweden (4-9 million rials). United Kingdom imports of woollen textiles slightly increased, most other countries except Japan showing decreases. The United Kingdom also easily maintained the lion’s share of the market for bicycles. Transit Trade. Statistics of transit trade show the interesting facts that imports for transit of silver bars (mostly from the United Kingdom) totalled 76,678,237 rials; of silver coins 10 million rials; and of precious stones 2-76 million rials. The destination of these articles is not shown, but it is probable that most of them were re-exported to India. Tables are attached showing the value of imports from the more important importing countries, and also the value of certain selected imports with their countries of origin.

Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 19.) (No. 276.) Sir, Tehran, June 1, 1934. WITH reference to my despatch N o. 571 o f the 11th December last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith three copies of the tableau general issued by the Persian Customs Administration for the economic year June 1932 to June 1933,(*) together with a revised memorandum by the commercial secretary on the foreign trade of Persia during that year. 2. The memorandum is on the same lines as that forwarded with my despatch under reference, but certain important alterations were necessary on account of the wide discrepancies between some of the figures given in the tableau general and those culled from the preliminary monthly bulletins. The revised figures show that both imports and exports were lower than indicated in the preliminary returns, and the adverse balance is higher at 135,500,000 rials (equivalent to about £1,379,000 at the average rate of 98 rials 27 dinars to the £). Both imports from and exports to the Soviet Union are now shown to have been higher than previously reported. Similarly, imports from the United Kingdom actually increased from 93,500,000 to 104 million rials (about £1,058,000 at the average rate for the year) and represented 15*8 per cent, of the total imports instead of 12 per cent, as previously reported. The corrected figure for imports from India and Ceylon is 74 million rials instead of 67 million rials. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 81), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Bagdad (No. 37) and to the hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 105). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. June 19, 1934. Section 3. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by the Commercial Secretary, Tehran, respecting Foreign Trade of Persia in 1932-33. THE statistics published in the tableau general for 1934 show such wide divergencies from those obtained from the monthly bulletins and summarised in my memorandum of the 12th December last that it is necessary to rewrite the whole memorandum. The following table shows the general position of imports and exports during 1932-33, and a comparison with the previous year :— 1931-32. Rials. Total imports ... ... 669.220,588 Exports of Persian produce excluding mineral oils ... 718,024,736 Mineral oil exports ... 1,017,948,566 1932-33. Rials. 657,578,555 522,040,916 1,143,279,000 Total exports ... 1,735,973,302 1,665,319,916 Imports declined by nearly 12 million rials as compared with the previous year, but exports of Persian produce, other than mineral oils, fell by no less than 196 million rials. It is customary in Persia to assess the balance of trade by comparing total imports with exports of Persian produce other than oil, and on this basis there is this year an adverse balance of 135-5 million rials, as compared with a favourable balance last year amounting to 49 million rials. If, however, ( 1 ) Not printed. [140 t—3]2 exports of oil products are taken into consideration, a favourable balance of no less than 1,008 million rials was achieved. Exports. (a) Mineral Oil Products .—Exports of mineral oil products were valued at 1,143 million rials, an increase over the preceding year of 125 million rials. Of this total, exports to the United Kingdom accounted for 443 million rials, Egypt for 240 million and France for 126 million rials. (b) Other Exports .—Exports to the Soviet Union declined, mainly as a result of the trade dispute with that country, from 267 million rials or 37 per cent, of total exports last year to 126-5 million rials or 24-2 per cent, this year. The United States took 83-5 million rials of Persian produce, carpets alone accounting for almost 73 million rials of this total. Exports to the United Kingdom, at 71 million rials, were almost the same in value as last year and therefore repre sented a higher percentage of total exports than previously (13-6 per cent.). [ India accounted for only 55-7 million rials (10-7 per cent.), against 87 million last year, and exports to Germany decreased from 63 to 43 million rials. Exports | f° Japan amounted to only 4-6 million rials, which included opium to the value of ! 3^ million rials. Carpets exported from Persia went mainly to the United States (73 million rials), the United Kingdom (35-5 million rials) and Turkey (22-7 million rials). The Soviet In ion was the main buyer of raw cotton (30 million rials), compared with 104 million rials last year, smaller quantities being taken by Germany (6 • 9 million rials) and India (5 million). Towards the end of the economic year, Japan began to buy small quantities of Persian cotton and has since bought considerable quantities, probably largely as a result of the Japanese boycott of Indian cotton. Imports. Owing to the trade dispute with the Soviet Union during the latter half of the economic year, imports from that country fell from 274 million rials, or 41 per cent, of the total, to 207 million rials (31-5 per cent.). Imports from the United Kingdom increased from 93-5 million rials (13-9 per cent.) to 104 million rials (15-8 per cent.). There was a considerable decline in imports from British 1/ India (110 million to 74 million rials). Japanese imports more than doubled &lt;1 during the year, the respective totals being 25 and 52 million rials. Total imports of cotton piece-goods during the year were valued at 168-7 million rials, as compared with 231 million last year. This decrease was pre sumably largely due to the Perso-Soviet dispute, and imports of cotton goods from the Soviet Union declined from 124-7 million rials last year to 71-3 million rials yjj this year. Imports from the United Kingdom fell from 42-2 to 32-6 million W rials, and those from India from 32-7 to 16-4 million rials. In striking contrast 1 to the foregoing figures, imports of cotton piece-goods from Japan increased j from 19-1 to 32-9 million rials, and an appreciable increase was also recorded ; in the case of Italy (9-7 to 14 million rials). Japan also deprived India of her preponderating’ share of cotton yarn imports, the Japanese figures being 4-7 and 17 million rials, whilst Indian imports declined from 27 to 16-4 million rials. Although considerable dissatisfaction has been expressed in the Tehran bazaar at the constant price reductions of Japanese piece-goods, it appears to be the case that these articles have been definitely under-selling the Soviet product, quality for quality. The Soviets are now, however, attempting to regain some of the ground they have lost by considerable price reductions. A certain amount of British trade is certain to be lost, and has already been lost, in face of this severe competition, but the better qualities have not yet been much affected am. will no doubt continue to find a market in Persia in proportion to the degree of prosperity in the country at any given time. The I nited Kingdom obtained an increased share in the imports of machinery, motor cars, trucks, motor cycles and bicycles and woollen piece-goods Tables are attached showing the country of origin of imports of these commodities during the last two years.( J ) A table is also attached showing the value of imports from the six principal importing countries during 1931-32 and 1932-33.(') S.

I HAVE the honour to transmit, herewith, a memorandum by the commercial secretary on the foreign trade of Persia for the economic year 1932-33, prepared from the monthly customs returns. 2. The latter half of the year was ve^ much affected by the Soviet-Persian trading dispute, to the influence of which the figures of trade between the two countries bear eloquent testimony. In view of the very important share which the Soviet Union normally holds in Persia’s foreign trade, it is somewhat surprising to observe that imports into Persia during the last year were little more than 1 per cent, less than in the previous year, but exports other than mineral oil products declined by 24 per cent. As the dispute still continues, its depressing effects will undoubtedly be shown in the eventual returns for the current economic year, notwithstanding the serious efforts now being made by Persia to find alternative markets for heT’^-p^oduce. In respect of one of her important export commodities, Persia has uplo the present been very fortunate, as Japan has purchased considerable quantities of Persian raw cotton in partial replacement of Indian cotton, which she is at present boycotting. Recent reports also suggest that the Soviet Union is now purchasing large quantities of Persian rice, and it is considered in some quarters that this action is probably the harbinger of an impending settlement between the two countries. 3. As has frequently been reported from this Legation, the narrow interpretation of trade policy under the foreign trade monopoly by the Persian Government had led to practical stagnation of the trade of the country, but the recent decision to increase the import quotas by a very considerable amount and to allow the importation of goods previously prohibited (see my despatches Nos. 559 and 567 of the 2nd December and the 8th December respectively) point to the adoption of a more liberal policy, and already much improvement is evident. 4. Apart from the falling-off in Soviet-Persian trade recorded in the enclosed memorandum, probably the most interesting feature is the considerable increase in the importation of Japanese cotton yarn and cotton piece-goods, an increase which has been effected largely at the expense of imports from India and, to a smaller extent, of those from the United Kingdom. This considerable increase was achieved in a year when total imports of cotton piece-goods into Persia had fallen from 231 million rials last year to 164 million rials. The returns do not show any other appreciable imports from Japan, but since the end of the economic year considerable imports of cement from that country have been effected at prices which are said to defy competition. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T. (B) 224), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 103), and to the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 239). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting the Foreign Trade of Persia in 1932-33. THE following notes on Persia’s foreign trade in the economic year 1932-33 (June to June) have been compiled on the basis of the preliminary statistics [15 b—4j2 published in the monthly customs returns for the period. The figures are liable tx&gt; minor changes when final statistics for the year are published, particularly in vievv of the fact that the present returns include imports eM franchise :— Total imports 1931-32. Rials. 669,220,588 Exports of Persian produce, exclud ing material oil products ... 718,024,736 Mineral oil products ... ... 1,017,948,566 1932-33. Rials. 660,277,000 # 535,591,049 1,133,661,951- Total exports 1,735,973,302 1,669,253,000 Imports declined by only 9 million rials as compared with the previous year, whereas exports of Persian produce, other than mineral oils, declined by 182 million rials. It is customary in Persia to assess the balance of trade by comparing imports with exports of Persian produce other than oil, and on this basis there is an adverse balance of 125 million rials, as compared with a favourable balance last year amounting to 49 million rials. If, however, exports of oil products are included, a favourable balance of no less than 1,009 million rials was achieved. Exports. (a) Oil Products. Exports of oil products amounted to 1,133 million rials, an increase over last year of 116 million rials. Of this total exports to the United Kingdom accounted for 544 million rials, Egypt for 240 million and France for 132 million rials. (b) Other Exports. Exports to the Soviet Union declined, mainly as a result of the trade dispute with that country, from 267 million rials or 37 per cent, last year to 103 million rials or 19 per cent, of total exports this year. The United States took 79 million rials worth of Persian produce, carpets alone accounting for almost 73 million rials of this total. Exports to the United Kingdom, at 69 million rials, were slightly less in value than last year, but the proportion of the total (12-9 per’cent.) was higher. India accounted for only 42 million rials (7-5 per cent.), less than half last year s figure, and there was also a decrease in exports to Germany, from 63 to 40 million rials. Exports to Japan were valued at only 6 million rials. Carpets exported from Persia went mainly to the United States (73 million rials), the United Kingdom (36 million rials) and Turkey (20 million rials). The Soviet Union was the main buyer of raw cotton (34 million rials compared with 104 million rials last year), and smaller quantities were taken by Germany (6 -75 million rials) and India (5 million rials). Towards the end of the economic year Japan began to buy small quantities of Persian cotton, and has since bought considerable quantities, probably largely as a result of the Japanese boycott n of Indian cotton. Imports. Owing to the trade dispute with the Soviet Union during the latter half of the economic year, imports from that country fell from 274 million rials, or 41 per cent, of the total in 1931-32, to 169 million rials, or approximately 25 per cent, of the total. Imports from the United Kingdom declined from 93-5 to 79 million rials (12 per cent.), and those from India from 110 to 67 million rials (10 per cent). Japanese imports more than doubled during the year, the respective totals being 25 and 55 million rials (8 • 3 per cent.). Total imports of cotton piece-goods during the year were valued at 164 million rials as compared with 231 million rials last year. This decrease was presumably largely due to the Perso-Soviet dispute, and imports of cotton goods from the Soviet Union declined from 124-7 million rials last year to 70-8 million rials this year. Imports from the United Kingdom fell from 42-2 to 29-8 million rials, and those from India from 32-7 to 11 -8 million rials.3 In stiiking contrast to the foregoing figures, imports of cotton piece-goods from Japan increased from 19-1 to 33-8 million rials, and an appreciable increase was also recorded m the case of Italy (from 9-7 to 14 million rials). Japan also deprived India of her preponderating share of cotton yarn imports, the Japanese figures being 4-7 and 16-8 million rials in 1931-32'and 1932-33 respectively, whereas Indian imports declined from 27 to 16-4 million rials. Although con- ^sideiable dissatisfaction has been expressed in the Tehran Bazaar at the constant .v •Vice reductions of Japanese piece-goods, it appears to be the case that these articles at the moment are actually able to undersell the Soviet product, quality loi quality, and it will be very interesting to see whether the Soviet product is able to recover the lost ground if an eventual settlement of the dispute with Persia is achieved. Although a certain loss of British trade in cotton goods is inevitable m lace of this severe competition, the better qualities are not yet affected, and they are likely to continue to find a market in Persia in proportion to the degree of prosperity in the country at any given time. Imports of woollen goods increased last year, the respective figures for the moic important countiies in 1932—33 and 1931—32 being : Belgium, 5*4 million rials (4-8), France, 4-6 (2-7); United Kingdom, 2-8 (0-86); Italy, 2 (1-4); and Germany, 1 (0-38). The Lnited States accounted for the lion's share of imports of motor cars and lorries, with 189 of the former valued at 3-7 million rials, and 447 of the latter at 17-8 million rials; imports of these two items from the United States of America last year totalled 672 units, valued at 16 -6 million rials. The United Kingdom was the only competitor in respect of imports of cars, 66 of which valued at 910,000 rials were imported against 28 last year, valued at 400,000 rials. Fair progress was also made in imports of lorries 'from the United Kingdom, 93 valued at 2-6 million rials comparing with 16 last year valued at 316,000 rials! Other countries importing lorries were Czechoslovakia, with 19 valued at 1 -5 million rials, and Germany with 7 at 732,000 rials. Tyres and spare parts came mostly from the United States (13-3 and 6’4 million rials respectively), but France (2-9 million rials), and the United Kingdom (1-1 million rials), also supplied a certain quantity of tyres.

I attach a statement showing the balance of trade in both Krans and Pounds Sterling, taking the rate of Krans 90.- which was the official rate during the period, the Bazaar or de facto rate varying between 102 and 110. 3. These statistics are interesting as ueing the first since the trade monopoly law came into force on 25th February 1931, but they do not cover a long enough period to show the full force of the prohibitions especially as prohibited goods, shipped direct to Persia before 1st March of that year, were allowed in against a guarantee to export Persian products within 4 months and so are included in these figures. 4.

Unfortunately no eeparote figures are available for the imports of bullion and specie. 'These, however, only amounted to 42.4 million fcreae in 1929/30 and cannot therefore account for any appreciable part of the reduction in imports which marked the year 1930/1. This should of course be escribed to the dearth of exchange and the fall in the purchasing power of the population resiOiting from the continued slump in the price of silver during the last Persia* year. 3. It will bs noted that there was a general fall in the kran values of all imports and exports in 1930/1 whereas the year before (see ray despatch under reference) there was an actual increase In the kran values of both iraports and exports other uhen oil, although there was a reduction in their sterling values. 4. llie exports of oil no longer help to finance imports, ncm ! that the Gcvemirent not only credit the oil royalty to their gold reserve but alao monopolise the whole of the His Majesty's 1 rind pel Secretary of State for foreign exchange...
