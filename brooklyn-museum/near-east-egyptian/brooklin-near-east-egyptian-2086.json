His feet rest upon a footrest from which descends a tang. He wears a tight-fitting cap and a short kilt. His right hand rests thumb up on his lap. His left hand, also resting on his lap, holds a cylindrical object which is probably to be interpreted as a papyrus roll. \r\n\r\nCondition: Green/black patina. The surface is very shiny, and it may have been coated. Some small spots of bright green and blue indicate reformation of new patina.
