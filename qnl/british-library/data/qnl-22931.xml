As you will see both from A and 3 t if you and your wife axe to visit here at all, and, as 1 said in my telegram, we shall be delighted to put you up, a sloop from the Senior H&amp;val Officer is the only way. There are, 1 believe, technical rules against women travelling on His Majesty’s Ships but these are sometimes waived. If you wish to ask for a sloop the beet way would be for you to do it through the Admiralty. 3. I am afraid that with the limited time at your disposal it would be wiser to out out Shiraz. Though the weather is improving by the end of February the ihiraz- BusUire road sometimes even then becomes impassable for some days at a time owing to enow or rain. 4. it would of course simplify your movements on the Arab aide if you could use an H.A.jP. n* chine.

Lieut .-Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrains 3 m mt' n xl 1 i Foreign Office, S.W.l. January 11th, 1937. ATE. My dear Loch, I have 'been meaning to write to you for a very long time about my projected trip to Arabia, but I have been hoping from day to day that I should be able to get my plans fixed so that I -should tell you something q u i^ definite v/ithout the risk of having to v/orry you with a lot of changes of plan. 1 But although, for reasons beyond my control, my plans are still a little uncertain, I must send you a line^to thank you for your very kind letter (No. D.O.C/559) of December 22nd, and also fbr the pharrning Christmas card which you sent us a little oarly/and which has long adorned our mantelpiece. The position is that the Saudi Minister, who is arranging our journey across Arabia has asked us to do the crossing from East to West/instead of from West to East/ so as to arrive in Jedda sufficiently long after the pilgrimage to be able to see Ibn Saud and his Ministers when the pilgrimage rush is over. On the other hand my time and dates are I strictly limited,because I -iSTnot ^ be away for more than a maximum of six or seven weeks, ert*4 cannot leave before inant-Colonel Percy Loch, C.I.E., the .... Dlitical Agent, Bahrein# ' r &gt; • ■ il.j ! i i ■ 4' *2 the 9th of February, and have to be back here by Easter. Also for various reasons I am not anxious to fly more than is really necessary. We have now provisionally arranged to arrive in Bagdad on February 17th and to get to Koweit on about the 21st. The British India agents here swear that there is a ship (the S.S. 'Bandra') leaving Koweit on February 24th for Bushire and Bahrein^and I am therefore provisionally re serving a cabin in her. This will get «!/to Bushire on February 25th, but vfether zjjfasy there or not depends almost entirely on whether we can get a sloop to take us ^frotn Bushire to Bahrein a few days later. If no sloop is availai we shall, I think, have no choice but to take the 'Bandra' on to Bahrein, merely paying a vist to Fowle of an hour or two while the ship is halting off Bushire. In that eventw should arrive at Bahrein on February 26th. Alternatively if there was any hitch about the 'Bandra' we should fly from Koweit to^eith&amp;ft Thursday, February 25tli or on Sunday February 28th getting to Bahrein the same aftef noon.. I should very much like to avail myself of your kind invitation to spend at least two clear days at Bahrein, ao there are a lot of things X should like to see there, and perhapsperhaps it might even be possible - if there are any R.A-P. aircraft available - for me to get a glimpse of the Qatar peninsula and the much discussed Jebel Nakhsh. But a good deal depends on what arrangements I can make to get away from Jedda. I had counted on the Khedivial mail sailing^on March 17th for Suez.or failing that la doop to get across to Port Sudan in time to catch the /'train for Wadi Haifa and Cairo. But Bullard tells me that all the sailings of the \La— Khedivial mail at^^hopelessly disorganised owing to the returning pilgrims^ and that in any case to travel by the Khedivial would involve all kinds of quarantine difficulties. For some time I hoped to get a sloop to Suez, but I find that^,owing to the necessity of re-fitting at Malta^H.M.S. ’•Londonderry” will have to leave Jedda for the north not later than March 8th\while her successor will not yet have CV'^ cu«_» o~ arrived. I am now trying for an Italian steamer/scheduled to leave Jedda on March 19th; and^if this works out ^right / there will be no further difficulty^,as it will enable us to catch the Imperial Airways service from Alexandria to Brindisi on March 23rd. But I fear I shall not know for a few days yet, so that everything is to some extent still in the melting4 ( If we can get a passage on the Italian ship leaving j e ^ on the 19th we shall not need to cross to Uqair until March 3rd, 4th, or 5th at ,-tho oarlioot^ since a clear fortnight shom&lt; be ample for the journey across Arabia and our visit to Jediia But if there is any snag about the Italian ship and I have to make special arrangements to get across to Port Sudan we might of course have to leave Jedda earlier^and this would mean cor respondingly advancing our crossing to Uqair. I am so sorry that there should be all these complicaticcs and uncertainties, but I hope we shall be able to surmount tha and we are much looking forward to spending two or three days with you as you so kindly suggest. I will telegraph as soon as possible letting you know what we have been able to settle With renewed thanks for your letter. Yours sincerely, ~ JUt.Jeddj •ch |V ■ shoun Jeddj, ve to raiglt AIR mail. i ^ My dear Loch, \! With reference to my letter and to my telegram of yesterday, of January 11th I write to confirm n cor- catiii nt tha days soon ettle, that v,e hope to arrive at Bahrein on March 3rd^since the S.N.O. has very kindly offered to transport us from Bushire in a sloop on March 2nd. I have now been able to alter my arrangements at this end^and have reserved accommodation in an Italian ship leaving Jedda on March 22nd for Suez. This will UAC give us plenty of time (to do the Arabian crossing and to spend a few days in Bahrein^and I therefore propose not to leave Bahrein until March 6th. I hope this will suit you. If by any chance you can arrange with the R.A.P. authrities for me to be flown on either March 4th or March 5th over the Jebel Nakhsh and the Khor-el-Odeid it will be very useful as the frontier question, is, as you know, one of our standing cases here^and there is nothing like seeing the thing on the spot to give one he necessary perspective.

My dear Fowls, Dr.l'awelke, the decretaxy to the German Legation here, recently told a member of my staff ^Mon tgomeryt , who was just off on a trip to the Gulf, that he would himself like to visit Bahrain in the near future. he asked Montgomery to mention the matter to the Political ^igent. Montgomery did so and Loch, tfio was not enthusiastic about the idea, said that he could not in any case agree to the visit unless you were first consulted. If Pawelke were allowed to come, he added, he wuld like to put him up at the Agency in order to be able to keep an eye on him during his stay at Bahrain. heedless to say I shall do nothing to encourage Pawelke in his Wanderlust but if, as seems probable, he returns to the charge, I think it would be difficult, without di acourtesey, to refuse him permission to visit Bahrain, and 1 hope you will agre that this may be given, if necessary. It would be explained to him that there is no suitable place at which he could stay on the island, except at the Pol- -itical Agency, and that Loch, whose accomodation is limited, would have to be given proper warning. Pawelke, who is a personable enough fellow, is inclined, I must admit, to ask embarassing questions, but I do not consider that there is any real harm in him and that he would have eitheror opportuni ty to do anything hurtful to iiritiBh intereata in the courae of a abort flying trip to the Gulf. hi a object ia probably to give the rf/ilhelmatraaae the impreaaion that he ia a very active diplomat! at and peraona grata in Britiah official circle a. i auppoae by the way that he would alao very likely wiah to viait Koweit. tfill you please let me know if you aee any serious objection to 1 awe Ike going to the Gulf ?

He would like to gp down as far as Muscat, if poas- -ible, and at all events to Bahrain and Koweit, but his actual programme must necessarily depend on the movements of Royal Air tforee planes and sloops, in any case he vrould, of course, like to visit Bushire during the course of his tour and, if connections fit, he would be glad to take the opportunity of visiting Lincoln at -Bandar Abbas. He hasn’t attempted to work out any dates yet but I think the most convenient time for him to arrive in the Gulf would be the early part of next month. 2&gt; Would you be so very kind as to send me a short wire to say if you see apy objection ?

As you know our accommodation in the Agency House is limited to four rather small bedrooms, and I suggest therefore that Her Royal Highness and the Karl of Athlone should stay at the Agency (and also the French maid), but that Lord Frederick Cambridge and Gault should go across to the Adviserate where the Bel- graves have very kindly offered to put them up. 3. I shall presumably receive fairly full instructions in due course, but in view of the stress laid on the 'private” nature of the journey the following points occur to me at once: (i) Should I send my launch across to the mainland for ^ ' the party, and if so would it be proper for me to ^ ^, go and meet them there, arrangements being made through Jeddah? (ii) Should there be a semi-official reception at Bah- o rain? We do not know yet whether His Highness the Shaikh will be back by then, though the news of this visit may cause him to hurry somewhat, but I suggest it would be proper for him, or in his ab sence the 1/embers of the Regency Council, to be on the Customs pier to welcomo the party to Bah rain. This might be followed by a formal call on the following morning if time permits. 4 N | *- ji &lt;• r o. t * (iii) I imagine that after the journey from Biyadh the Athlones would like a lazy day or two in Bahrain but would any or all cf the following be consider ed appropriate? (a) a small dinner party, limited to 12, at the Agency. (b) a lunch party at the Palace. (c) a visit to the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s Refinery.

And unless the party is feeling very tired I would venture bo recommend that (b) be accepted since it would give such enormous pleasure in Bahrain, (c) is a very du bious proposition, since a tour round the Refinery is lia ble to be one of the most boring things on earth and one never sees a drop of oil from end to end; but it is after a-.l an 0 PPJ r ^ n ity of seeing a Refinery working direct with an Oil Meld, and one cannot see that everywhere in the world.

WEIGHTMAN His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent Bahrein* ^ Dear Mr. Weight man ; As you undoubtedly know, the Karl and Countess of Athlone are expected to visit our operations here on or about March 16, and from this point will proceed to Bahrein Island. We understand that the party coming across Arabia is composed of seven members. It would give the California Arabian Standard Oil Company great pleasure to have yourself, together with Mrs. Weightman, as visitors to our camp during the time the Karl and Countess of Athlone are here. Should this invitation find acceptance, we will endeavor to have our launch 'Calarabia' at your disposal on the day the Athlone party is expected, to bring you and Mrs. Weigbtman over to Arabia. V/e would appreciate your advising us as soon as con venient as to the possibility of your visit with us here. Further anl definite plans will depend on your reply. Yours very truly,No. C/176-12/9 The 8th March 1938 I believe that you are In charge of the A1 Khobar Camp during Mr. Ohliger* a absence and I am therefore writing to you In reply to his letter of the 7th March 1938. I should like to express first of all my deep appreciation of his kindness in inviting my wife and myself to A1 Khobar during the time that Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and the Karl of Athlone are there. 2 . I fear it will not be possible for my wife to take ad vantage of this very kind invitation as she must remain in Bah rain in order to receive the Athlones* party when th y arrive here. I myself have been instructed to meet the party on the mainland and I have great pleasure in accepting this kind in vitation on my own behalf. 3. I do not wish to give you the trouble of sending over your launch 'Calarabia' to take me to Al Khobar f especially as my own launch will have to proceed there in order to take the party 1 s luggage across to Bahrain. I will therefore come across in my own launch, and if it is convenient to you, I should ex pect to arrive about 6 p.ra. on the 16th March. If you could possibly lend me your launch on the following day in order to bring over the Athlones* party to Bahrain I should be most grateful indeed.

Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to submit the following short re port on the visit of Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and the Earl of Athlone to Bahrain. 2. I received a telegram from Hasa informing me that the party would reach A1 Khobar on the 16th March, and I proceed ed to A1 Khobar on the afternoon of that day. The whole par- ty, myself included, was accommodated in the Camp of the Cali fomia Arabia Standard Oil Company at Dhamman, and on the morning of the 17th an inspection was made of the Company* s operations there. The main item of interest was the new deep well which is at present under a ten-days’ test for pressure and volume. It may be remarked in passing that there is a high spirit of optimism amongst the employees of the Company, and that a beginning has already been made with the deepening of wells which had previously been sunk without result to a depth of 2000 feet only. 3. The passage from A1 Khobar to Bahrain was made in the afternoon of March 17th in the Company* s launch which has infinitely greater speed than my Agency launch. A strong wind was blowing and the passage was uncomfortable, though no casualties resulted. Apprehension regarding this crossing had/-- 2 - had caused the visitors to decline the official reception by His Highness the Shaikh which had been offered at Bahrain; and the evening was spent quietly at the Agency. 4. On the morning of the 18th March His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain accompanied by Shaikh Abdullah bin * Isa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad paid an official call on Her Royal Highness and on the Earl of Athlone at the Agency. This was followed immediately by a return call, in which Her Royal Highness also joined, at the Shaikh 1 s Palace. There a Guard of Honour was drawn up and was inspected, but otherwise formality was avoid ed. The two calls occupied close on two hours and gave the utmost delight to His Highness Shaikh Hamad. The afternoon was spent quietly, and in the evening a small dinner party was held at the Agency to which were bidden Mr. and Mrs. Belgrave, Mr. and Mrs. Van Peursem of the Arabian Mission, and Mr. Thorn- berg, Vice-President of the Bahrain Oil Company. 5. On Saturday the 19th March, the morning began with a call on Her Royal Highness by Her Highness Shaikha Ayesha, wife of the Shaikh of Bahrain. Later the whole party walked for an hour through the more interesting parts of the Manamah bazar where a few purchases were made. The bazar, it might bi mentioned, is firmly convinced that Lord Frederick Cambridge is a younger brother of His Majesty, travelling incognito. Then followed luncheon at Sakhir with His Highness the Shaikh at his country home. The meal was served in Arab fashion, though at a table. His Highness gave expression to his great pleasure by presenting a sword, but he left it delightfully vague whether the presentation was to the Princess or to the Earl of Athlone. Two Arab horses were also presented. From Sakhir the party proceeded to the Bahrain Oil Company* s Refi nery where the more interesting processes were shown and explained. /-explained. On returning to the Agency two of the leading pearl merchants were brought in to display their stocks and the whole process of weighing, appraising and dealing in pearls (as it is known in Bahrain) was explained. Mr. Deacon the Resident Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum CAmpany, and Mrs. Deacon were invited to tea. The evening was spent quiet- ly in preparation for an early start on the following morning. 6 . The visitors left Bahrain in Royal Air Force aero planes at about 7.30 A.M. on the morning of the 20th March. His Highness the Shaikh was present at the aerodrome to bid farewell. 7. Since this was a private visit everything was carried through in as informal a manner as possible. I trust it will not be held presumptuous in me to say that the kindness and friendliness shown by Her Royal Highness and the Earl of Ath- lone to His Highness the Shaikh and the A1 Khalifah Family has created a really amazing impression. His Highness is de lighted beyond words and is retiring today to his hunting lodge at Ramaithah in order to savour again in retrospect, without interruption, the immense happiness of the last two days; and I doubt if anywhere in the East could there be mat ched the devoted loyalty which is burning today in the breast of Shaikh Hamad of Bahrain. If it is not an improper proposal might I suggest that a humble request be made to His Majesty the King that photographs of Their Majesties be s ent to His Highness the Shaikh to commemorate this first visit to Bah rain of Members of the Royal Family? Naturally the Shaikh has no idea that this proposal has been made, but were the re quest to be granted his cup of happiness would indeed be full.

Hope to arrive Bahrain March 9th. 'Dated the 10th March 1940 Thank you very much indeed for your letter of the 9th March 1940 and for telling me about all the arrangements* It is very kind of you and the Company to take so much trouble over this visit and I fully appreciate that you would have looked after us from start to finish if the Qosaibis had not been ordered by the ' ing to take part in the entertainment. 2 . There are one or two points to mention in regard to the details* In the first place I am afraid I cannot guarantee the time at which we shall arrive. The difficulty is that the Political resident arrives in Bahrain on ' ednesday morning by the up fast mail and I have to wait in order to see him for a few minutes before we go across. If the ship arrivesj as it should g[o 9 early in the morning we shall not be delayed and ought to be across at A1 Khobar at any rate by mid-day. If the mail boat is a little delayed I shall have to detain His Excellency in order that he and the Political Resident may meet; but if the mail boat is very late then I think the best plan will be to send His Excellency and his Secretary across with the Oosaibis and I myself will follow. I am arranging with Rodstrom to meet your launch on its way across from A1 Khobar to Panama that morning and to send you a wireless message telling you exactly at what hour we shall be there. I am very sorry that our arrival is so complicated but I am sure you will appreciate that it is due to circumstances over which I have no control. 3/- Ohliger f Esq..

I suggest therefore that we start from Dharan at 9 a.m. as arranged and go straight to Has Tanura, and then return via Hafwa where v/e can have the Arab lunch, proceeding afterwards to A1 Khobar and returning to Manama from as it will also save any inconvenience which might otherwise have been caused through delaying your launches. 5.

I was much impressed by the success of the Politioal Agents and yourself in achieving such a tranquil and pro-British atmosphere. I wish I could learn how to bring about such a satisfactory state of affairs in this restless country* I would like also to mention how kind Captain Howes was to me at Sharja both on my outward and return journeys. I was sorry to have given him a lot of trouble in vain on the latter ocoasion when an excess of zeal in discharging cargo throughout the night frustrated plans for my landing at Dubai* If you, or any other of your people in addition or succession to those I have had the pleasure of thus learning to know, are ever in Bagdad I hope they will give me the opportunity of showing my gratitude in any way I can.

The accommodation was adequate and no doubt the best has been done having regard to the material available and the un certainty of the location of halting places in the future. But if it is likely to remain a place v/here the planes, which land at Sharja and the flying-boats which alight on the creek at Dubai seven or eight miles away, deposit their passengers for the night on the British Empire route it is to be hoped that something more worthy will in due course be provided. The sanitary arrangements in particular seemed to me to be unnecessarily primitive, seeing that fresh water has been discovered and that the Rest House is not like Rutba stuck away in the middle of a remote desert but is at a port served by the British India Steam navigation Company. Sharja is of some importance as a centre for the Royal Air Force. On the night when we were there there were two Blenheims from Karachi and two from Shaiba ^near Basra) which had been out all day searching for the ill-fated Hannibal which had disappeared between Jask and Sharjah on the previous day. *7e were lucky enough to find Captain Hov/es the Political Agent for the Trucial Coast la post / which .- 2 - which has been created for the duration of the present v/ar) stationed at Sharja, and he very kindly took us for a short trip by car. tfe visited a watch-tower in which five or six pictureaq.ue cut-throats were ensconced about halfway up; they let themselves down by a rope in order to greet us and show us their ancient muskets whoch looked as dangerous for the marksman as for his mark. The whole scene was strongly remote from present-day reality elsewhere, in the immediate vicinity hostilities were in progress with the neighbouring tiny Shaikhdom of Dubai. Shaikh Mani a rebellious cousin of the Shaikh of Dubai had taken refuge at Sharja; his presence there was a source of suspicion and offence to the Shaikh of Dubai and had thus resulted in the present hostilities, it might have been prudent or at least tactful of Shaikh Mani to seek refuge further afield, but his flight had been a very natural precaution since not many months ago certain other nota lies of Dubai who were believed by the Shaikh to have conspired against him had had their eyes put out. The whole trouble originated, if i understood the complicated story aright, in an unsuccessful attempt to establish an executive council and thus curtail the Shaikh , s powers. Hostilities between Sharja and Dubai v/ere proceeding in a leisurely fashion and had resulted in four casualties up to that date. The two towns did not seem to be much affected but communications between them ty land were interrupted and i was told that the inconvenience resulting in this and other ways was making the conflict increasingly unpopular. in consequence of it 1 could not visit Dubai from Sharja and 1 refrained from calling on either of the t v/o Shaikhs. Pearling, fishing and a few ragged date plantations seemed to be the economic mainstays of these two little towns, but perhaps smuggling / ^7 3- is also a considerable source of profit* Their hinterlands which have not yet been delimited are extensive and may of course be found to contain oil* The population of Sharjah was estimated by Khan Sahib Abdul Razzaq. the local Residency Agent, an Arab, at betv/een 5,000 and 10,000 and that of Dubai at between 30,000 and 40,000* in the authoritative ••Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf” compiled by J^G^Loriraer, 1.C.S., in 1905 the population of Sharja in 1902 was estimated at 18,000, and that of the whole Shaikhdom at 45,000 v/hile the population of the town alone of Dubai v/as given as 10,000. xxx x xx xxx x xx BAHRAIN * 13. On Sunday, March 10th, we arrived off Manama which is the capital of the main island of Bahrain. This again is an open roadstead where we had to anchor two or three miles offshore • Bahrain consists of a group of small islands of which the two principal are Muharraq to the north and Bahrain Island itself which is far the largest being some thirty miles in length with a maximum breadth of eleven miles. On Muharraq Island is the airport used by the Royal Air Force and by Imperial Airways both for land planes and flying- boats. The landing ground consisting of firm sand is one of the largest in the world; occasionally it is flooded by high tides. There is a considerable population of pearl fishers and other residents and the town of Muharraq is connected with Manama, the capital of Bahrain, by a causev/ay. A gap has had to be left in the causeway to permit v/ater traffic to pass if not also on account of the depth of the / channel-4- m channel at that point and for tidal reasons# This gap is about to be closed by a sY/ing bridge now under construction by Messrs. Holloway Brothers v/ho have just completed two much larger bridges in Bagdad. 14. The population of Bahrain is about 125,000 of v/hom 1,600 are British Indians and some 8,000 or 9,000 are of Persian origin. There is a British community of about fifty including Mr.C.D.Belgrave who is British Adviser to the Sultan, an Inspector of Customs, tv/o engineers, a doctor and 11 1 v ; : : ? : ; &gt; II ? a lady doctor, in the camp of the Bahrain Oil Company there is an American and British staff of 500. in accordance with an understanding when the concession was granted the Amei'icans are being gradually replaced by British subjects. There is also a British naval station, l was told that the Arabs, owing to their laziness and lack of constructive ability have lost the predominance they originally held with the exception of the family of the Shaikh who is achieving complete pre-eminence owing to the large increase in his revenues resulting from oil royalties. Mr,Hugh V/eightman, the Political Agent, was good enough to call in his launch to take us to stay with Mrs. Weightman and himself at the Agency and Consulate. On the following day Mr.Weightman took me to pay my respects to His Highness the Shaikh at one of his palaces some miles av/ay from the capital, where we were entertained to the usual Arab meal. 15. also visited the tombs which are one of the most intruguing features of ancient Bahrain. They consist of a series of large mounds, each one of which seems to &lt;x&gt;nstitute a kind of family mausoleum and to contain a number of graves some evidently for children. The graves face in different directions apparently haphazard, and the one 1 saw which was opened up for the first time in my presence was v/ell made v/ith smooth faced stones for the sides and bottom, the top being / coveredf) • , 4 . &gt; ? covered with large unhewn stones, inside it very little was found, only a few sniall bones • About eighteen months ago in a similar mound the discovery was made of a low circular well- built wall about three feet in height forming a perfect circle, two trenches, over which there had perhaps been a platform, intersected at the exact centre. There were no graves but the earth inside the circle was full of small bones from animals so that presumably this particular mound, the only one so far discovered of its kind, had been a place of sacrifice. Some years ago a good deal of excavation was carried out by archaeologists but i understand that no explanation of these tombs has yet been found, nor any reference to them in ancient records, although this extensive burial place must have been famous at some distant date. A similar burial place exists at Jebrin not far southwards on the mainland. 16 . In the afternoon 1 saw an up-to-date hospital which is being completed in Manama, it is at present in charge of Dr. McDowell, a lady whose brother is a surgeon in Bagdad. A new senior doctor is due to arrive before long. 17. The next day 1 was shown over theoil camp of the i Bahrain Oil Company which is registered in Canada but is purely American and owned by the California Arabia Standard Oil Company. The American manager, Mr.W.Anderson, and a British colleague, Mr. J.S.Black, and the British doctor in charge of an up-to-date hospital, Dr.Kennedy, and other representatives of the company were most kind in showing us over the refinery and the hospital, modem laundry and other up-to-date features of the camp. The incidence of illness was at one time very high but had been, i was informed, brought below what was normal elsewhere, partly by the installation of the modern sanitary laundry, but chiefly by the provision of air-condition ing. The oil wells are at Uio levels, a little over 2,000 feet and a little over 4,000 feet respectively. Their life is /e stimatedeEtinxited at a minimuin of fifteen years and nay prove to be from thirty to forty* The refinery treats 20,000 barrels a day from the Bahrain field and another 10,000 to 12,000 barrels a day shipped from the oil company operating on the mainland* 18* ihe refining process at Bahrin differs from that in operation at Abadan and Khanacjin and produces a petroleum coke ae a by-product* This has not as yet been marketed and a dump of about 150,000 tons has been accumulated* It appears to be excellent fuel and it occurred to me that a F^arket might be found in Iraq where ordinary coal is almost prohibitively expensive costing from £ 6 to £ 8 a ton* i am enquiring whether meanwhile some of it can be made available for consumption in the grates of diplomatic households in Bagdad including my own. BAHRAIN A ND THE COAST OF HASA . 19. On the following day Mr.Weightman, Mr. Man and I crossed from Bahrain in a large motor launch lent by the Shaikh to see an oilfield opened up by the California Arabia Standard Oil Company on the mainland* After rather a rough voyage of tv/o hours we landed at Al Khobar, the small port for the main oil camp at Dhahran located on an elevation about five miles distant. We were accompanied by Saiyid Abdul Aziz al Quosaibi who owns extensive date plantations on the mainland near Qatif and was acting as a kind of unofficial Saudi escort. His occasional attempts to obtain official recognition as a Saudi representative in Bahrain are not encouraged but his action in accompanying us on the present occasion was regarded as a civility to which Mr.Weightman saw no reason to object* At Al Khobar we were received by a guard of honour and various Saudi officials who were most polite and friendly. Our hosts were the California Arabia Standard Oil Company and its most hospitable manager Mr. / Floyd•7- Floyd Ohliger, with whom i stayed for the night, informed me that but for his resistance my whole time would have been taken up at meals and other entertainments arranged for my benefit by the Saudi authorities. We spent the afternoon in seeing the oil camp and some of the oil wells. The houses are small but all are air-conditioned. The wells in this area were at the same depth as the Bahrain deep level wells, that is to say from 4,000 to 4,300 feet. We learnt however that within the last fortnight a well had been brought in at 10,000 feet at /vbu Hadria, an oilfield which is being developed towards the north. From ten to tv/elve thousand barrels were sent over daily from A1 Khobar to the refinery at Bahrain and the remainder from Dhahran was piped to the port of Has Tanura. up to 30*000 barrels a day. The amount being exported from Has Tanura did not exceed 20,000 barrels a day and was often much less according to the tankers available, i understand % that no decision has yet been reached as to whether the oil from the northern field would be piped to Has Tanura or to some nearer port such as Jubail, 20. The road from Dhahran to Has Tanura has to follow a more circuitous route than the pipe-line and is some sixty miles in length, it is only an oiled track but motor cars and lorries can proceed at a good speed except at one or two places where there is loose sand which despite the employment of oversize desert balloon tyres is liable to be an obstacle. It is already possible to reach the northern oil camp from Dhahran by car in about five hours and to go on from there, skirting the neutral zone, to Kuwait in another eight hours. From Kuwait to Basra it is only three and a half to four hours so that a practicable motor route is in process of evolution / from The pipe-line is about forty miles in length and its capacityfrom Basra to Bahrain and beyond* The development of air transpoi t may be equally practicable • -Landing grounds have been provided by nature at amnay places, e.g.Kuwait, Bahrain and Shaija,and others in the interior may v/ell exist or be capable of easy construction and maintenance* Portable wireles outfits are another important aid in the conquest of the desert. Brackish water adequate for cultivation and household purposes already exists at many points e.g.Qatif and Hofuf and further supplies of brackish and even fresh water will perhaps be discovered before long in response to the search which the -ciinerican oil company is making, it looks therefore as though many of the difficulties which for centuries have kept the Saudi Arabian peninsula in isolation may soon be overcome. Even that of the fear or dislike hitherto felt j for alien visitors may soon diminish as the'native inhabitants l become accustomed to American oil prospectors and learn to appreciate the material benefits resulting from their opera tion. Americans are actively engaged in the search for oil and their travels about the country for this purpose will presumably be encouraged in view of the sources of wealth , which may thereby be developed. The scale on which the company is working is shown by the fact that it employs seme 300 to 400 Americans and 3,000 natives. Most of the latter are Arabs but they include Indians and also Christian Chinese to whom the Saudi Arabian Government object less than to Indians. HAS TAPTURA, SAFWA AND QATIF. 21. After spending the night at Dhahran, our hosts motored us to Ras Tanura which lies on a spit of sand connected with the mainland by a strip so narrow as almost to constitute a causeway. Some years ago the hope was entertained that Ras Tanura would develop into a port of some importance and a larg custom house was then built. No development in fact I occurred until theoil company went there. The bay betweenI &gt; 7 between the spit on which Kas Tanura is situated and Qatif can only be used by shallow draught vessels. The tankers take theii oil from a submarine pipe«*lin6 on the north-west side where the anchoarge is deep and fairly well sheltered. The number of storage tanks was being increased and construction was in progress of a small refinery to meet the needs of Saudi territory. The camp is on a much smaller scale than that at Dhahran but i noticed that the American engineers were housed in small portable cabin dwellings which were all fitted with air-conditioning apparatus. 22. On the return journey we stopped in a date plantation for lunch at Safv/a on the property of Saiyid Quosaibi our escort from Bahrain. Safwa lies a few miles to the north of Qatif. It is a good deal smaller but considered to be the best part of the oasis. Warm springs of clear aquamarine water well up at various points and supply plantations of dates extending from Safwa to ^atif and beyond, i was told that a similar and even larger oasis exists at Hofuf in the southern part of Hasa. (Hofuf is the name given on the map but is I was told only the chief town or village amongst a whole group containing a total population of from 100,000 to 20t,000. Arabs commonly refer to this group not as Hofuf but as Hasa so that as used by them the word Hasa may mean either the whole province or this main centre of its population). After enjoying a large Arab luncheon at Safwa and seeing a little of the immediate surroundings which are unusually attractive on account of the pools of clear water and the date groves, we continued our journey on to Q,atif where we were entertained to coffee, tea and incense by the Governor, Saiyid Humud, who received us with a motley guard of honour. An old native town struggled beyond mud walls over a considerable area among the date plantations. Ancient and picturesque Q,atif formed an interesting contrast with modern and efficient Dhahran. it has derived its population and prosperity from dates and pearle but for some years both / thesethese sources have been on the decline* From Q.atif we made our way back to Dhahran and thence to A1 Khobar to rejoin the Shaikh 1 s launch. We were seen off by the Saudi Arabian authorities who could not have been more ftiendly or hospitable. Previously in Bagdad the Saudi Arabian Minister, while making no difficulty about a visit to the oil camp at Dhahran, had suggested that there could hardly be anything which we could want to see at Has Tanura or c^atif • Any hesitation which this may have betokened on his part was in no way reflected in our actual reception on the spot* Amongst the American hosts to . whom we were particularly indebted for their hospitality and great kindness were Mr .Floyd Uhliger the Manager in charge and Mrs .Ohliger, Mr .Edward Skinner, Mr. and Mrs.C.Da vis, Mr.R. Miller in charge of the construction of the Ras Tanura refinery and the Assistant Manager Mr.G.Witherspoon. XXX XX X X x X XCONFIDENTIAL.

Dear J^rior, Dr. Fox, the Director of the Geological Survey of India, has suggested that a good deal of useful help might be given to officers in the Gulf if occasionally officers of the Geological Survey of India were invited to spend two or three weeks with them as mineral advisers. These Geological officers would go on study leave or would make a halt en route to or from leave in the united Kingdom. While at the headquarters of Political Agents, they could read over the files, make contact with the geologists of Companies at work there and perhaps see a little of the country where minerals are believed to occur* in this way it might be possible to avoid mi sunder stauidings here (which local knowledge alone can prevent) and also provide yourself and Political Agents with useful advice. 2. Fox's suggestion appears to us to have much to commend it and we should be grateful for your views. Yours sincerely, ad. .R.hay.

According to the programme Sir Andrew is due to leave Bahrain for Hasa on 20/11/1335. ft 7/'°n the 14th November 1335 Khan Bahadur Abdul ^ziz Qusaibi came to see me and after general conversation said that he would like to invite Sir Andrew Ryan to a meal, jas his brother had received hospitality in Jedda from '-ir Andrew Ryan. I said that 1 would let Bjj? Andrew know |of his kind invitation but that I could not give him any reply as I did not know his plans. G.L.- 16/11/35. Sir Andrew Cyan’s aeroplane came about one hour late ! and 1 had a long talk with R-han ^ahadur Abdul Aziz Qusaibi. 2. In the beginning he mentioned his invitation to dinner and I said that it would be difficult.as I was giving a dinner on one night and the Adviser was giving a dinner on another. He had also mentioned the possibility 'of his giving lunch on board the launch which was to take pir Andrew Ryan to Oqair and I said that I thought that was a very good idea and I was sure that Bir Andre' Ryan jwould accept it with pleasure. ?. Khan Bahadur ^bdul Aziz Qusaibi has arranged for ia good launch to take Sir Andrew to Qatif. I introduced him at the aerodrome and it was arranged that they should leave Bahrain at 0700 hours on Wednesday (20th November). 4. I told Sir Andrew that I had been non-committal54. to Khen,Bahadur Abdul Aziz Qusaibi and had seen ^ *4 that the time was filled up as I was not sure that he v.as a man with whom Sir Andrew Byan should dine. Sir Andrew said that he had received from Hafidh Wahba in Bondon an invitation to dine with Abdul Bahman ^usaibi at Bahrain but he had not committed himself and as Abdul Bahman was in xv iyadh the question did not arise. He thought that the matter was suitably solved by his accepting lunch on the launch. G.L.- 18/11/35. Telegram ^o:239 of 17-11-1935 from Jedda. Telegram N 0 :167 doted 19-11-1935 to Jedda.
