The following enclosures are included with Kemball’s letter:1. Letter no.36 (folios 194-95) from Robinson to Kemball, dated 20 February 1854. In the letter Robinson describes his meeting with Shaikh Sultan ben Suggur [Sultan bin Saqr] on board the
                           Clive, whereupon Shaikh Sultan conceded that there was no substantive evidence against claims of the misappropriation of funds by the British Native Agent at Sharjah Hajee Yacoob [Hajjī Yaqoob]. However, Robinson reports that Shaikh Sultan insisted that he was simply acting upon claims made to him by the inhabitants of Lingah [Bandar-e Lingeh]. Robinson also reports of a reconciliation having taken place between Yaqoob and Abdul Rahman Boo Boosheil, the latter having harassed Yaqoob previously2. Letter no.37 (folio 196) from Robinson to Kemball, dated 20 February 1854. Robinson reports on his discussion with Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr on the recent hostilities between the maritime chiefs of Oman (specifically the chiefs of Abu Dhabi and Dubai). The enquiries relate to the apparent theft of a boat from Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi] to Sharjah by a number of runaway slaves, which Robinson has instructed Yaqoob to make further enquiries into.3. Letter no.105 of 1854 (folios 197-98) from Kemball to Robinson, dated 29 March 1854, in which Kemball requests that Robinson assist in the requisition of the boat alluded to in Robinson's own letter (folio 196). Enclosed with Kemball’s letter is a translated extract of a letter from Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Chief of Rasul Khymah [Ra’s al-Khaymah] to Kemball, dated 19 February 1854. The extract states that inhabitants of Debaie [Dubai] took the boat with its crew and slaves.4. Letter no.39 of 1854 (folio 199) from Robinson to Kemball, dated 20 February 1854, in which Robinson writes of a report he has received from the Native Agent at Sharjah Hajjī Yaqoob, relating to clashes between two tribes in Sharjah, resulting in the deaths of two people. Yaqoob informed Robinson that armed representatives of both tribes had set off by boat to Bandar-e Lingeh to consult with Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr, however, Robinson writes that Yacoob’s fears of hostilities at sea appear to have been unfounded.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000028#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
