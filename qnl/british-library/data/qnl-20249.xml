October 31, 1935. , CONFIDENTIAL, fv^ / S ection 1. / I re. f'lv'if 1 / &lt; ^^ u ^f [E 6419/206/25} Sir Samuel Hoare to Sir A. Ryan (on leave). (No. 317.) Sir, Foreign Office, October 31, 1935. YOU will shortly be the guest of King Abdul Aziz at Riyadh. While there, you will be engaged in further negotiations on the su bject of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, and orTthe subject of slavery, on both of which matters you have already received full instructions. 2. Though it is to be expected that these topics will occupy a great part of the time available for political discussion at Riyadh, nevertheless I request that you will not fail at the same time to use every endeavour to secure an adequate settlement from King Abdul Aziz on the subject of his blockade of Koweit. As you are aware, this blockade has'Tio\^ been maintained for more than ten years, and as long ago as 1929 His Majesty's Government promised the Sheikh of Koweit, in return for his co-operation which was loyally given in the interests of Ibn Saud during the Ikhwan rebellion, that they would do their best to secure an honourable settlement of the question. During his visit to London this year the she ikh received assurances, to which he attaches the highest value, of the interest of His Majesty's Government in his affai rs. I enclose a copy of a telegram from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 892 of the 25th October, 1935), which emphasises how unfortunate would be the reactions in Koweit and in the Persian Gulf generally of any failure to secure a settlement of the blockade question in the course of the Anglo-Saudi negotiations now in progress. On account of the political and strategic importance of Koweit (both actual and potential) His Majesty's Government are anxious to strengthen their friendly relations with its ruler. For this and for other reasons they are bound in pursuance of their promises to him to make every effort to secure a satisfactory settlement and to defend his legitimate interests vis-a-vis his powerful neighbour. 3. You will recollect that the conference between Saudi and Koweiti delegates, held at Koweit in the early part of the summer, dispersed without achieving a settlement. From the series of letters exchanged by the delegations, of which I enclose copies for your convenience, you are aware that King Abdul Aziz was ready to agree to the proposed method of controlling Saudi-Koweiti trade, namely, that trade should be directed to one or more customs posts on the Saudi side of the frontier and th at a ll exports should be provided with manifests issued by the Sheikh of Koweit. You will recall, however, that His Majesty attached to his acceptance the condition that this arrangement should be auto matically terminated if, after its institution, a single Koweiti was detected smuggling. This demand the sheikh could not, of course, accept; but he offered, as an alternative, a guarantee on his honour that he would do all in his power to stop smuggling and would severely punish offenders. King Abdul Aziz then declared this offer to be inadequate and instructed his delegates to break off the negotiations. 4. The matter was then taken up in London during the conversations last summer with Fuad Bey Hamza, the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, at which you yourself were present. It was explained to him that the Saudi Government's demand was most unreasonable, since no State, not even the most highly organised, was in a position to give a guarantee that not a single case would occur of its regulations being evaded, and he was informed that if King Abdul Aziz would accept the sheikh's alternative offer of an honourable under taking His Majesty's Government for their part would do all in their power to ensure its observance. Fuad Bey, before leaving London, promised to look into the matter. 5. After some time had elapsed His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Jedda, acting on my instructions, invited the Saudi Government to give him their views on the matter in the light of the consideration which it had doubtless received [531 hh—T] B QOPY SENTiii consequence of the conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza m London. M r -^3} drew the Saudi Government's attention once more to the importance which His Maiesty's Government and the Government of India attach to a solution o his problem and reiterated the willingness of His Majesty s Government to do a m their power to ensure that the honourable undertaking offered by the sheikh should, if accepted, be observed. . , * x .• 6. Of this communication, which was dated the 12th August, no mention was made when the Saudi Government informed Mr. Calvert in a note dated the 1st September that in view of the increase in smuggling which the Saudi Govern ment alleged had taken place since the breakdown of the Koweit conference (but which was denied from Koweiti sources) they intended to enforce an even closer blockade and virtually to prohibit all movement across the Saudi-Koweiti frontier. The Saudi Government were, therefore, reminded on the 16th September that a reply to Mr. Calvert's previous representations was still outstanding and they were warned that if they insisted on demanding impossible conditions from Koweit they would assume the sole responsibility for the present unsatisfactory situation. Copies of these two notes are enclosed. 7. On the 15th October the Saudi Government addressed to Mr. Calvert a note in reply to the above-mentioned communications. From the summary telegraphed by Mr. Calvert, the Saudi Government appear to have asserted that they had not sought to interfere in the affairs of Koweit and that responsibility for the present situation and for the loss which had been caused to Saudi Arabia thereby thus rested with Koweit and (as it would appear from oral explanations furnished by the Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs) with His Majesty's Government. They maintained, moreover, that the demands made by the Saudi delegation at the Koweit Conference might justifiably have been severer but that they were none the less reasonable in that they would have entailed loss to Saudi commerce and represented the utmost sacrifice which could be made. The Saudi Government expressed regret that such sacrifices should have been characterised as unreasonable, and their note concluded by asserting that agreement on the matter would only be possible if Koweit were to give the required guarantee absolutely to prevent all smuggling. 8. Such arguments are unacceptable to His Majesty's Government, who can only regard this note as evidence of an unsatisfactory and indee(f~obstructive attitude on the part of the Saudi Government. In particular, insistence on a literal acceptance of the condition which King Abdul Aziz seeks to attach to an agreement is manifestly unreasonable. I shall accordingly be glad if you will draw the serious attention of King Abdul Aziz to the matter at Riyadh. 9. You should begin, as on previous occasions, by reminding the King of the unremitting efforts which His Majesty's Government made to improve and oonsolidate relations, first between Saudi Arabia and Iraq and then between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. These efforts proved successful, and have led to settlements which have been to the great advantage of all the parties concerned. His Majesty's Government are now most earnestly desirous of bringing about a similar improvement in the case of relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. Aware of the many bonds which have linked those two Arab States in the past, His Majesty's Government are sincerely anxious to see relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit placed once more on a normal and friendly footing. His Majesty's Government cannot but feel that, with this object achieved, their friendship for both parties will have been most strikingly demonstrated. 10. You should then briefly remind King Abdul Aziz of the recent conference and of the subsequent action of His Majesty's Government, and repeat with as much emphasis as you deem prudent the views of His Majesty's Govern ment on the guarantee demanded oi the sheikh by the Saudi delegation, and now still insisted on in the Saudi Government's note summarised in paragraph 7 above. You aie authorised to point out to His Majesty, if you think fit, that he stands to gam nothing by insisting on an absolute guarantee, since, even if the sheikh were to give it, his Excellency could not, with the utmost goodwill, achieve more than would be his duty under the honourable undertaking which he has offered as an alternative and which His Majesty's Government are prepared to endorse. King Abdul Aziz will appreciate the fact that the sheikh, like any other ruler or Government, could but use his utmost endeavours in either event. Ar . n - , Zll 1 then i nfo ™'he King that, in the considered opinion of His Majesty s Government, the sheikh's offer of an honourable undertaking to do so,3 coupled with their own good offices, would give him all the assurance which is either necessary or obtainable. I trust that these arguments will not fail of their effect, but if they do, you may use your discretion to inform King Abdul Aziz that His Majesty's Government regard this matter as a test of his desire to establish Anglo-Saudi relations on an even more cordial basis than at present, and that it will increase the beneficial effects of your visit to His Majesty if it results in a happy solution of this long-standing and dangerous dispute. 12. There is one further argument of which you may find it possible to make some general use in conversation with King Abdul Aziz or with his Ministers. In his despatch No. 256 of the 10th September, His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires mentioned that Sheikh Muhammad Tawil, the Saudi Director of Customs in Hasa, had expressed himself to a member of His Majesty's Legation as being in favour of a radical reduction of Saudi customs dues, a policy which he professed to have recommended to King Abdul Aziz. There appears to be little doubt that such a policy, if applied, would remove the cause of much of the smuggling which is now carried on into Saudi Arabia from Koweit, by reducing the disparity between the Saudi and the Koweiti customs dues. This policy would also encourage importers to land their goods on the Saudi coast rather than at Koweit, and would thus tend to promote one at least of the objects for which it is understood the present Saudi blockade of Koweit was instituted. I fear that it would be too much to expect that King Abdul Aziz can be easily induced to see the unwisdom of maintaining his customs duties at an almost prohibitive level, fiuTT consider that, subject to your views, there may be advantage in explaining this aspect of the matter to him. I am, &amp;c. SAMUEL HOARE. &gt; ,— fj ^ f i ylJ i (Secret.) Enclosure 1. PoHfical Resident in the Persian Gulf to Secretary of State for India. (No. 892.) . ,a (Telegraphic.) ^ 4 ^ Risher, October 25, 1935. ADDRESSED to Secretary of State for India and repeated to Government of India, Jedda. Copy by mail, Koweit. Jedda telegram No. 192 to the Foreign Office: Koweit blockade. Attitude of Saudi Government, which is apparently still that by which they deliberately torpedoed Koweit Conference, is most disappointing. 2. Sheikh, on my return through Koweit, again appealed to me most earnestly on question of blockade. As result of his conversations in England he has evidently high hope that His Majesty's Government mean to implement their assurance on the subject of blockade, and failure to do so now on our part, even though circumstances may be difficult, will mean that his trust in our good intentions towards him will receive a severe and most undesirable shock, which will have repercussions in other Arab States of the Gulf, v 3. T quite realise the importance of treating Ibn Saud liberally, but I have always felt (see, for instance, my telegram of the 8th June, T-112) that Koweit blockade should be made the acid test of desire of Saudi Government for our friendship. I venture to suggest, therefore, whether, in view of persistent unfriendly attitude of the Saudi Government over this point, it would not be [ ? equitable] for [ ? Ryan] on his coming visit to Riyadh to intimate to Ibn Saud that any new offer from His Majesty's Government regarding the blue line [? to-day] is dependent on Ibn Saud adopting a reasonable attitude towards the eminently practicable suggestion of the sheikh regarding [ ? manifests] et cetera {vide paragraph No. 3 of sub-enclosure to my printed letter of 28th June).

(After compliments.) 1 . 1U IN view of what is known to you and to us, and also to every high-born and poor person, of the good and friendly relations which have existed foi veiy many years between the A1 Sabah and the Al Saud dynasties, more especially between His Majesty King Abdul Aziz and his Excellency Sheikh Ahmad-al-Jabir, and in consequence of the desire of both countries to further strengthen these relations, by removing the trade blockade of Koweit, we have suggested below the most suitable method, as seemed to us, for the resumption of the export trade (from Koweit) with His Majesty's Kingdom. These are as follows ;— (1) That customs collecting centres should be established within the frontiers of His Majesty the King. These may consist of one post or more than one, and in such places as His Majesty the King may choose. (2) That his Excellency Sheikh Ahmad-al-Jabir shall, for his part, assist to the best of his power in the control and guiding of all exports to the above posts or centres. This will be by means of manifests, which will be issued in triplicate; the first copy to go with the goods, the second to be handed over to His Majesty's local agent, Abdulla-an-Nafisi, and the third one to remain in the customs office of the local Government. The above is the opinion we hold, and the procedure is one which is recognised between kingdoms and nations that are good neighbours, as well as by others. II.— Translation of a Letter dated the 23/^ Rabi Auwal, 1354 {June 24, 1935), from the Saudi Delegation to the Koweiti Delegation. ^ (After compliments.) WITH reference to the discussion which we had with you to-day in regard to the resumption of ' Musabalah ' (' trade ') between our country and Koweit, we beg to reiterate in writing, in addition to what we explained verbally, the good intentions of our Government, and the affectionate spirit, friendliness, and good feeling which they have towards the Koweit Government, and to say that they (the Saudi Government) are prepared to continue conversations with a view to arriving at a satisfactory conclusion between both sides, and to discuss measures to remove all misunderstanding for the future. Such conversations, however, must be on the one clear basis, that the Government of Koweit shall give ' guarantee ' (' dhaman ') with regard to goods passing (across frontier) to His Majesty the King's territory (i.e., that nothing is smuggled apart from goods sent under manifests). This, indeed, is what we proposed in the course of our discussions (Usual ending.) with you.Should your esteemed delegation agree to negotiate on this basis, we are prepared once more to discuss the subject in order to arrive at the conclusion sought by both sides. . (Usual ending.) Note by Political Agent. —The above letter, as will be seen, is worded some what differently from what the Saudi delegate laid down as the only basis for future talks (see my telegram No. 211 of the 25th June), namely, that Koweit must agree before anything else to guarantee that not even a single smuggler got across the border. They appear to be playing for safety. The Koweit delegates have not missed this point, and in their reply have pinned the Saudi delegates down to what they actually did say. III.— Translation of a Letter dated the 24^ Rabi Auwal, 1354 {June 25, 1935), from the Koweit Delegation to the Saudi Delegation. (After compliments.) \ WE have received your esteemed letter dated the 23rd Rabi Auwal, 1354 (June 24, 1935), and have understood what you stated as to your good intentions as well as the good intentions of His Majesty King Ibn Saud's Government, namely, that you are prepared to continue conversations with a view to arriving at a satisfactory conclusion between both sides, and to discuss measures to remove all misunderstanding, but that such conversations must from now onward be on the one basis, that the Government of Koweit shall first give ' guarantee ' (' dhaman ') with regard to goods (smuggled) passing across the frontier. You added that if our delegation would agree to the 'guarantee ' condition on behalf of the Koweit Government, then you would be prepared to continue the talks. We wish, therefore, now to make the matter quite clear. The situation is, as we suggested to you in our letter dated the 16th Rabi Auwal, 1354 (June 17, 1935), and as was also discussed with you in yesterday morning's meeting (June 24, 1935). You stated that the ' guarantee ' system was desired by His Majesty's (Saudiyeh) Government, which was that nothing should be smuggled, and only goods exported according to manifests should be allowed to pass into Saudi territory. That should any smuggler be caught, his goods would be confiscated, and the Koweit Government would have to pay the customs duty imposed on same. Also that should this happen more than three times. His Majesty's Saudi Govern ment should have the right to cancel the agreement. At the same meeting we replied to you that the Koweit Government would give you their word of honour to do all in their power to prevent smuggling. And that should any smuggling be discovered (within her territory) the Koweit Govern ment would inflict the severest of punishments on the evil-doer. As regards the '' guarantee '' insisted on by you—with every precaution taken and every goodwill, we say this cannot be realised. Hence it is not reason able of you to make such a condition. That which the Saudi Government is afraid of {e.g., smuggling), should it occur, will be trifling and very small, because of the measures that will be taken by His Majesty's Saudi Government and the Govern ment of Koweit. It should certainly not affect the goodwill, and the desire for a reciprocal agreement between His Majesty the King and his Excellency Sheikh Ahmad-al-J abir. We have every hope, however, that owing to your deep insight you will not allow a doubtful and unreasonable defect to stand in the way of good understanding. We beg for a reply to this, and express the hope that we shall come to a good understanding.

Therefore, we request that you will kindly inform us m cleai mannei as to your final decision, either you should agree to the ' guarantee basis, or decline from it, in this wav the situation will be made quite clear, and we can submit a report to our Government.

WE have received your letter dated the 24th Rabi Auwal, 1354 (June 25, 1935), in reply to our letter of the same date, from which we understand that you consider our reply not to be clearly put, and that you now wish to be informed definitely whether we agree to the '' guarantee '' basis or not, in order that you may submit a report to your Government. Contrary to what you say, we believe that we have made the position quite clear, and have not been obscure. We explained to you that the ' guarantee ' basis, which you demanded in yesterday's meeting, could not possibly be realised, in spite of every good intention and effort on our part; for, as we explained, the first case of smuggling that occurred would not only upset the plan, but would tend to have exactly the opposite result where the good agreement and connexions desired by both His Majesty's Saudi Government and our Government are con cerned. Therefore, you should either make propositions different to the above, or submit your present proposal, together with our reply to it, to your Government. We leave that to you.

WITH reference to the information you imparted to us in to-day's meeting, that His Majesty the King would not agree to the resumption of trade between Koweit and the Saudi Arabia save on the ' guarantee ' basis on the part of the Koweit Government. As you know, we have written a letter to you, dated the 16th Rabi Auwal, 1354 (June 17, 1935), in which we stated the views we considered good for' both countries. On the other hand, in the meeting of the 21st instant (June 22, 1935), you demanded a ' guarantee,' and we stated in our letter of the 24th instant (June 25, 1935) that that ' guarantee ' was impossible to give, as it could not practically or theoretically be enforced. In a second letter, also dated the 24th instant (June 25, 1935), we asked you to submit both your proposition of 'guarantee' and our reply to it. to His Majesty the King.I If His Majesty the King, as you informed us definitely and verbally to-day was the case, does not agree to anything but that we give the '' guarantee '' asked for, then all that is left for us is to make it known that we cannot commit ourselves to any such ' guarantee.' Although we recognise that His Majesty the King and his Excellency the Sheikh Ahmad-al-Jabir are as brothers, and that there is no difference between our two countries and the two peoples, nevertheless we regret the failure of negotiations. We do not entirely despair, however, and still hope for agreement. We look to this conference as a first step to the understanding desired. May God destine agreement. Please acknowledge our letter. (Usual ending.) VII.— Translation of a Letter dated the 27th Rabi Auwal, 1354 {June 28, 1935), from the Saudi Delegation to the Koweiti Delegation. (After compliments.)

I HAVE the honour to refer to the communications which have passed between the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs and this Legation regarding the Koweit Conference, ending with the telephone message from Asad Bey A1 Eaqih of the 7th July last, informing me that the Saudi delegates had returned to Riyadh upon the breakdown of the conference. 2. Your Royal Highness is, of course, aware that this question was recently the subject of further conversations in London between the departments of His Majesty's Government concerned and his Excellency Euad Bey Hamza, who, as a result, undertook to refer the matter again to the Saudi Government for their •consideration. I am now instructed to enquire whether your Royal Highness's Government are in a position to place me in possession of their views on this question, in the light of the renewed consideration they have doubtless given to it consequent upon the London conversations. 3. I feel impelled once more to draw the attention of your Royal Highness to the importance which my Government and the Government of India attach to the settlement of this question, and I would strongly urge the Saudi Government to agree to the proposals put forward by the delegation of his Excellency the Sheikh of Koweit at the recent conference. For their part, I assure your Royal Highness, as his Excellency Fuad Bey Hamza was similarly assured in London, my Government would do all they could to ensure the fulfilment of the honourable undertaking offered by his Excellency the Sheikh, which in their view is all that oan reasonably be demanded.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 317 of the 31st October, regarding the Saudi blockade of Koweit, I transmit to you herewith t he accompa nying c opy of telegram No. 2974 of the 30th October, from the Government of India to the Secretary of State for India, which was received too late to be considered in connexion with my instructions to you, for your guidance in discussing this question during your visit to Riyadh.^) 2. You will observe that the Government of India, with a view to bringing home to King Abdul Aziz the serious view which His Majesty's Government take of his unfriendly attitude towards Koweit, advocate— {a) That you should pursue the suggestion made by Mr. Calvert in his telegram No. 165 of the 8th September (a copy of which is enclosed herein for reference^)) and contrast the very warm assurances of King Abdul Aziz's friendship for His Majesty's Government as the basis for his foreign policy, which were expressed by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in discussing the Italo-Abyssinian controversy with Mr. Calvert early in September last, with the attitude of the Saudi Government over their blockade of Koweit. {h) That you should reinforce this argument by also pointing out the analogy between the Saudi attitude towards the action of the Govern ment of Bahrein in the so-called Ahmedi incident and the point of view of Koweit in regard to the Saudi blockade. J) - I »(b 4 {c) That, if this representation still failed to influence the King's attitude, you should act in accordance with a suggestion made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in his telegram No. 892 of the 25th October (a copy of which was enclosed in my despatch No. 317 of the 31st October), and make the new offer of His Majesty's Govern ment for a settlement of the Saudi frontier in eastern and south eastern Arabia dependent on the Saudi Government adopting a reasonable attitude on the Koweit blockade question. 3. On grounds of principle I do not feel myself able to accept the proposals of the Government of India summarised at {h) and {c) above. As regards (6), there can be no doubt that the policy of the Bahrein Government in trying to penalise the steamship Ahmedi for carrying goods direct to the Hasa coast was at variance with all international usage and was quite indefensible. There is clearly no true analogy between such a policy and the action of the Saudi Govern ment in preventing commercial intercourse between their country and Koweit, which, however unfriendly towards His Majesty's Government and the sheikh, is not inconsistent with international law or practice. It would therefore, in my opinion, be m ; ost unwise to attempt to link up the two matters in any way, nor, having regard to the known feelings of the Saudi Government in regard to the Ahmedi case, does it appear that any result could be looked for other than a further embitterment of Saudi-Koweiti relations. Similarly, for reasons which will be familiar to you, I see strong objection to the suggestion of the Government of India summarised at {c) above. 4. At the same time I agree that there is now considerable force in the main suggestion of the Government of India, summarised at {a) in paragraph 2 above. When Mr. Calvert suggested early in September that attention might be drawn to the contrast between King Abdul Aziz's protestations of friendship and his policy towards Koweit, His Majesty's Government were particularly anxious C 1 ) Not printed.

At the same time it has become even more important that every effort should be made to put relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit on a normal basis, and that no argument shou be neglected which might influence King Abdul Aziz to his present unfriendly and obstructive attitude in maintaining a rigid blockade ot a sheikhdom in such close and special relations with His Majesty s Government. 6.

Eventually Fuad abandoned guarantee previously demanded but asked that agreement on the lines suggested by me should be supplemented by provisions for (1) control of persons engaged in trade who should be classified by nationality and place of residence, (2) precautions against fraud e.g. by persons profess- ing / VL-2- | professing to be bound for Iraq but intending to enter Saudi Arabia, (3) specification of fixed routes, and (4) extension of manifest system to dhows. I undertook to have these suggestions studied. Feeling that suggestions regarding control of persons might conceal fresh attempt to restrict all movements across frontier I made it clear thft I regarded them as applying only to persons handling merchandize who would have to be defined« 4. I found it better tactics to negotiate with Fuad although at one point I threatened to seek audience for discussion of question with King personally, vVhen Fuad reached position described in paragraph 2 above I assumed general sympathetic attitude but was careful not to commit Kuwait to a scheme which it may be difficult to reduce to practical form. I suggest that preliioinary consideration should be given without delay to Fuad^ suggestions but that no decision should be taken pending receipt of fuller record of ray conversations which will go by next bag* - RYAN.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

Kuwait Blockade: Sir Andrew Ryan's conversations at Riyadh# 3479 10148 (2) •5 'IWCTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT ———— — * •: x\ EASTERN (Arabia ). ' v f December 30, 1935. t CONEIDENTIAL. Section 5. [E 7570/206/25] Sir A. Ryan to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received December 30.) {No. 352.) y/- Sir, y Jedda, December 10, 1935. WITH reference to my telegram No. zl6 of the 8th December, I have the honour to forward a record, which I made before leaving Riyadh, of my conversations there regarding the Koweit blockade. 2. I may mention that on the occasion of my first visit to the Sheiikh of Koweit, in presence naturally of the Political Agent, I gave his Excellency renewed assurances of the strong desire of His Majesty's Government to remove his grievance against Ibn Saud in respect of the blockade and told him that I was taking to Riyadh new instructions on the subject. 3. In order to impress on Ibn Saud the importance of this question in the eyes of His Majesty's Government, I put it second only to the eastern frontier question, when informing Fuad Bey and later the King himself, of the subject I wished to discuss during my visit. 4. You will observe that my conversation with Fuad Bey on the 26th November was generally unsatisfactory. I think that he has already seen for himself that the not-a-single-case-of-smuggling condition was absurd, but was mortally afraid of his master. By the next day, he had evidently persuaded the King to be more reasonable. 5. I consider that Fuad Bey's suggestions regarding the control of persons carrying goods require very careful scrutiny. I did not press him to define more precisely what he had in mind, because, while anxious to appear sympathetic once I had gained the main point, I thought it better to wait and see how the suggestion, as stated in general terms by Fuad Bey, would strike the authorities in Koweit from the point of view of practicality. 6. I need hardly say that, if it should be at all possible to meet the views of the Saudi Government as now modified, I hope that the Koweit authorities will do so and suggest practical arrangements. I think it would be best to continue the negotiations through this Legation, rather than suggest a resump tion of the local conference. The great thing, in my opinion, is now to advance as soon as possible to an exchange of notes, in the hope that Ibn Saud may then relax his blockade measures, and to see over a period of six months or a year how the new arrangements work. I think that Ibn Saud was greatly impressed by the argument that his attitude hitherto has been inconsistent with his professions of friendship for His Majesty's Government. 7. I ventured to discuss with Colonel Fowle and the Political iVgents, quite privately and without in any way pre-judging your views, a suggestion of my own that it would strengthen the position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud in discussions affect ing Koweit (and Bahrein), if means could be found to confer upon the Sheikh (and on the Sheikh of Bahrein, for similar reasons) the title of 'His Highness.' As I explained to the Political Resident, I am well aware that this suggestion may present difficulty from other points of view, but I have long felt that, in correspondence with the Saudi Government, in which I have so often to impress on them the importance attached by His Majesty's Government to the position of the Sheikh of Koweit (and that of the Sheikh of Bahrein) as an independent ruler, I should have to use the title of 'His Excellency,' which, however respectable, is normally borne by subjects and which, moreover, has nowhere been so belittled by indiscriminate use as in the Near and Middle East. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Government of India, Bushire and Koweit. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. [581 gg—5] / .-v 2 Enclosure. Koweit Blockade: Discussions at Riyadh. IN my preliminary business conversation with tuad Bey on the 24th November, the day after my arrival, I put this second among the questions which I particularly wished to discuss during my visit. I outlined the views of His Majesty's Government referring to their strong desire to get this question settled, as the Iraq and Transjordan questions had been settled; to the impossible character of the ' guarantee which Ibn k?aud had demanded and to the Sheikh's counter-proposal that he should give his word of honour to do all in his power to prevent smuggling; to the readiness of His Majesty s GrO\ernment to back this; and to their difficulty in reconciling the King's attitude with his repeated professions of friendship towards themselves. fe 2. I mentioned the subject to the King at the outset of my first business audience on the 25th November, but had no opportunity of pursuing it then or at my second business audience next day, as the only subject discussed in detail was that of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers. In the event, as will be seen, I found it better tactics not to tackle His Majesty at all about Koweit but to apply pressure through Fuad Bey. a - f 3. Fuad Bey broached the subject at luncheon 'on the 26th November and stressed the importance of manifests. After luncheon I proved to him that this was provided for in the letter'from the Koweiti delegation to the Saudi delegates at Koweit of the 17th June, 1935. I gave him the translations of that and the ensuing papers in the Foreign Office print enclosed in Foreign Office despatch No. 317 of the 31st October to Jedda:' Fuad Bey then developed the argument that Koweit could not do without smuggling. I demurred to this on the ground that the main advantage which such a place derived from being an entrepot was that its merchants handled trade. I denied that smuggling was essential to the prosperity of Koweit as he had suggested, though I admitted that the temptation to indulge in it was great in cases such as the present when there was so enormous a disparity between the Koweiti and Saudi customs duties. (I had already tried to draw him on the question whether the Saudi Government intended to reduce their duties—see paragraph 12 of the Foreign Office despatch already quoted—but he professed complete ignorance on this subject.) lv 4. luad Bey, who was not, I think, very conversant with what had passed during his absence from this country, tried to make out that the 'guarantee'' demanded by the Saudi delegates at Koweit was not, in fact, a guarantee that not a single case of smuggling should take place. I demolished this suggestion, whereupon Fuad Bey, making no attempt to defend the guarantee, which had been asked for, suggested that other guarantees would be necessary. He outlined a system of passports or identity certificates for persons carrying goods. I said that something might be done on those lines but I rejected a proposal of Fuad Bey s that I should forthwith draft a note embojj^ing not only the two formulae in the Koweiti delegates' letter of the 17th June but a system of further precau tions against smuggling. I pointed out that I could not draft anything except in consultation with the authorities concerned and that, if the Saudi Government wished for further guarantees, it was for them to say what they wanted. Replying to a complaint of his that the Koweiti delegates had made no counter-proposals i egaidmg guarantees, I said that they had had no opportunity of doing so, as the Saudi delegates had taken them by the throat and had made acceptance of tne lorm oi guarantee demanded bv them a condition sine qua non of continuing negotiations. ^ 5 In defending his suggestion that I should draft a note, Fuad Bey let a 1 the incautious remark that he had no interest in the matter and that it was was w io was pressing for a settlement. I told him that he certainly ought to f q! e ^ s e( *- Kowert was the natural source of supply for the adjoining parts o k.au i rabia and it could not be to the advantage of the Saudi Government tf 16 * 1 ! own subjects a' system to enforce which rmjprr.TYim f ^ e . a ca P 1 tal offence. Fuad Bey rejoined that the Saudi nrWinW nf were J udges of how to treat th eir subjects. I invoked general haH nt l vem n 1stI'ation and then said that, in any case, his Government attacTed^hJntZ? m a se ;- tlem ent. His Majesty's Go^rnment, I said, ' inipoitance to the question. Ibn Sand assured them at everyV3 3 turn of his friendship. But, in this particular case, his attitude was inconsistent with his professions of friendship for His Majesty's Government, who were bound to uphold the interests of the Sheikh of Koweit. 6. In the end I again pressed Fuad Bey to tell me definitely what the Saudi Government wanted. Fuad Bey replied that he had no authority to mak^any suggestions and we left the subject. ,S 7. When Fuad Bey called again on the 26th November, I had r^-read my papers and was better prepared for him. I attacked him all along the line, pointing out that the Koweit delegates had in fact offered an alternative guarantee to that demanded by the Saudi delegates. They had offered a pledgery the Sheikh to use all his endeavours to prevent smuggling. His Majesty's Government had since offered to back those endeavours by their own. Fuad Bey asked what form the action of His Majesty's Government would take. Would the Political Agent be responsible ? I said that, if His Majesty's Government gave a pledge it would be for them to judge of the means of giving effect to it, but that doubtless any action that they took would be taken through the Political Agent, /v &lt;M 8. Fuad Bey drew me out as to what I considered would meet the case. I said that in my view all that was necessary was an exchange of notes incorporating heads (1) and (2) in the Koweit delegates' letter of the 17ththine plus the Sheikh's pledge and the assurance that His Majesty's Government would do all they could to ensure its fulfilment. I added that, while I had no instructions about a time- limit and did not know how my Government would view the suggestion, I should be prepared to recommend a provision in the exchange of notes, similar to that in the recent Bahrein transit notes, enabling either party to terminate the arrange ment by an agreed short notice. This would give the Saudi Government a remedy, if smuggling became in fact serious. 9. During this first part of the conversation, I told Fuad Bey that he had shocked me by two of his statements the day before, when he had said that he had no interest in the settlement of the question and later that he had no authority to make suggestions. As regards the first, I repeated what I had said previously. As regards the second, if the effective Minister for Foreign Affairs of the country told me he had no authority, I could only lay the matter before the person who possessed it, i.e., the King. 10. Fuad Bey resorted to one of his favourite devices and begged me to be practical. He then came into the open, having evidently got the King's consent to a partial surrender. He said that four points had already been put forward, viz. :— , (1) Manifests. ^ ^ ^ ^ (2) The Sheikh's pledge. l ' (3) His Majesty's Government's assurance. (4) My personal suggestion regarding time-limit. He said that the King had now decided to abandon the condition proposed by the Saudi delegates at Koweit but considered that, in addition to the above safe guards, means should be found to control persons engaged in trade with reference to whether they were— (a) Subjects of Saudi Arabia coming from Nejd. (5) Subjects of Saudi Arabia resident in Koweit. {c) Koweiti subjects. {d) Subjects of third Powers, like Iraq, Iran, &amp;c. 11. I agreed to submit this proposal for consideration, making it clear that in my opinion it would be necessary to define clearly what persons should be •covered. I pointed out that different classes of persons crossed the frontier for different purposes, regular traders, persons wishing to supply their own needs a.nd others, e.g., sportsmen. I did not exclude the possibility of control on the lines suggested of persons engaged in trade, but I understood it was in accordance with local customs that movements generally across the frontier should be as little restricted as possible. I had been told in Koweit that movement for the purpose of hawking, for instance, was considered quite a special thing, which should be free. 12. Fuad Bey reverted to the questions of manifests. Could they be given in all cases ? And what would happen, if a man took out goods, professing to be bound, say, for Iraq when his real intention was to import them into Saudii Arabia' He thought that the Koweit authorities themselves might find it embarrassing to hav? to supply the Saudi agent, An-Nafisi with all manifests. He considered that there should be stringent penalties for false representations as to destination. 13 Fuad Bey added two further suggestions. Fixed routes, should, he said, be specified. The provision for them implied in the word guiding ' in the Koweiti delegates' letter of the 17th June was not in his view sufficient. Secondly, the manifest system should extend to dhows, as goods might be embarked in dhows. for the Saudi coast. ^ u • ^ 14. Fuad Bey assured me that the King was animated by no spirit of hostility I thanked him for his assurance and said that I was quite willing to have all 'his suggestions examined. I said that in view of what he had told me I no longer considered it necessary to trouble the King pei sonally. ANDREW RYAN.

The supplementary instructions which were sent to him in our despatch No. 324 of 7th November (please see our official letter B 6475/206/25 of the same date) were evidently useful and it is satisfactory to know that ibn Saud seems at least to have realised that we feel strongly on the subject, 2. Our first impression is that the general basis at which Ryan arrived with Fuad Hamza for a resumption of the negotiations is promising, and that we can give it our blessing in principle, subject, of course, to the views of the authorities in the Gulf and to satisfactory arrangements being found possible for the system of control on the Saudi-Koweit frontier envisaged by Fuad Hamza. 3. As regards the particular points in Ryan 1 s despatch, we think that there is much force in the suggestion in paragraph 6 that it would be preferable to resume negotiations through the Legation at Jedda, since we feel that this is likely to lead to their being conducted in a calmer and more reasonable spirit than would be the case if they were left to another local conference between Arab delegations. I am not sure whether I entirely agree with the suggestion which Ryan makes in paragraph 7 that the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrain should have the title of 'Highness' conferred upon them. It is not so much that suggestion itself which I question as the motive on which it appears to be based. . tV 4. C.Walton, Esq., C.B.,M .C. It/It seems to us that there would be considerable risk in doing anything to emphasize the importance of these Sheikhs 'as independent rulers', since, although we wish to emphasize their independence of Saudi Araoia and of Iraq, I think you will agree that we certainly do not wish to weaken in any way their dependence on His Majesty's Government, On the contrary 1 think we are all in agreement that we should aim at tightening up our control over the Sheikhs; and it is surely as part of this policy that we have so long' been insisting that all political correspondence between them and Ihn Saud must pass through us. Apart from this general consideration might it not be very difficult to accord a rise in dignity to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrain v/ithout doing likewise to the Sheikh of Qatar, whose reputation and conduct seems very far from meriting such a distinction? Moreover, the lesser Trucial fry would probably also begin to agitate for a rise in status. 5. The only remaining individual point upon which we wish to comment at this stage is that of a time limit for any eventual agreement with the Saudi Government, which Ryan raises in paragraph 8 of the record of conversations enclosed in his despatch. Je think that Ryan's suggestion may prove a useful inducement to the Saudis to conclude an agreement, and while we naturally would not wish to encourage the Saudis to denounce any agreement that we were eventually able to put through, we feel it is impossible to expect the Saudis to tie themselves down to an agreement of a perpetual character. You will remember that a provision of the nature suggested by Ryan was inserted in the Bahrain Transit Dues agreement in deference to the wishes of the Bahrain Government, and we do not think that we can consistently deny the same privilege to the Saudis if it was to their advantage in the present case. 6. The question now arises of the procedure for pursuing the negotiations further. You will remember that when we saw Fowle's express letter No. 958-S of the 10th December ( a copy3. of which was enclosed in your official letter P.Z.9042 of 18th December), in which he proposed to instruct Dickson to approach the Sheikh of Koweit immediately the full record of Ryan's conversations reached him, we suggested to you that it would be desirable to hold up local action in the Gulf until we had had an opportunity in London to examine the results of Ryan's negotiations, and to prepare a preliminary expression of the views of His Majesty's Government. You agreed with our suggestion and sent your telegram No.4088 of the 24tlfDecember to Fowle, warning him to delay the approach to the Sheikh until receipt of the comments of His Majesty's Government. 7o We have, therefore, now to concert a communication to Fowle giving him a preliminary expression of the views of His Majesty's Government and instructing him to go ahead with the consultation of the Sheikh of Koweit. if you agree generally with the view I have expressed in paragraphs 2-5 above, 1 suggest for your consideration that the best course might now be to prepare in the first instance a draft express letter or telegram to Fowle, in which you would no doubt give us an opportunity of concurring. Obviously any views expressed on the Saudi proposals could only be general and pr eliminary in character, and we shall have to leave it to the authorities in the Gulf to make detailed criticisms and suggestions for the necessary arrangements for putting them into effect, if possible. But, if you see no objection, we should like to take up the three individual points mentioned in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 above. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)

I left the draft of a letter with Dickson, which was to be written to the Shaikh, but perhaps Ibn Saud's visit has delayed its despatch. In order to facilitate matters, I enclose herewith a copy of the draft. As you will see, it consists of a recapitulation of what the Saudi conditions are, and in paragraphs, of the Shaikhs own views. As I was rather in a hurry, I left these blank, to be filled in by Dickson. Please consult him and fill in the blanks, and despatch to the Shaikh. If Dickson has any doubt as to what the Shaikh said, please ask the latter to repeat his views verbally. On receipt of your letter, all the Shaikh has to dc is to confirm that his views as given in it are correct, though doubtless he will daborate them somewhat.

Sir, f- In continuation of ray telegrem No.77, dated the 29th February 1926, I have the honour to say that Eis Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait has agreed in principle to the proposals put forward by the Saudi Arab Government to Sir Andrew Ryan at Riyadh with a view to a settlement of the Kuwait Trade Blockade. S. I enclose copies of letters on the subject exchanged by this Agenqy vd th the Shaikh. 3. It will be seen that His Excellency delayed nearly a month in replying to this Agency letter. This was due partly to the visit of King Abdul Aziz^partly to the fact that at this time of year the Shaikh necessarily spends some time in the desert and outside Kuwait at his country residence, but also because he was obliged to consider carefully where agreement to the proposals would lead him. 4. It should perhaps be said, as the point has not been specifically made in sub para 4 of para 3, that His Slxcellency of course does not agree to the Saudi Arab Trade Agent, or any other Saudi ^rab here, issuing Identity Certificates. On discussing this point with him he thought it should be mentioned if there was any doubt ab out it. 5. His Excellency pointed out that the phrase in lines 8 and 9 of the same sub-para, 'and purchase suppliesE supplies up to certain limits' would in due course imply some careful consideration and mentioned various minor difficulties which might arise, such as leaders arriving at the frontier with less than their manifests stated^ Would they immediately be taken for smugglers? 6. I see no reason why such points should not be covered by the Regulations which will be in due course devised.. 7. You will no doubt honour me with your instructions but a possibility that suggests itself now is the drawing up of a draft 'Kuwait Hegulations for the Control of Caravans trading between Kuwait and L^audi Arabia** to which could be attached a letter of explanations from the Shaikh, I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Political Agent, KuwaitCopy of a oonfidential letter No-G-Sl, dated the 25th January 1926 from the Political Agent, Kuwait to His Excellency tlae Ruler of Kuwait* Subject: Saudi Blockade of Kuwait, After Compliments, As your iibccellency is aware Sir Andrew Ryan, during his visit to His Majesty King iibdul Aziz at Riyadh was to discuss the question of the Saudi trade blockade of Kuwait. In a conversation which the Hon'ble the Political Hesidant had with Your iibccellency yesterday (Friday 24th Januaiy 1936) , at which I v/as present, the Political Resident informed you, as directed by His Majesty T s Govern ment, that Sir Andrew Ryan had duly discussed this question during his visit. He further informed Your Iilxcellency that as a result of Sir Andrew Ryan's discussions the Saudi Government had put forward the following proposals:- (1)That Your Excellency should institute a system of manifests as suggested in head 2 of the letter dated ^ -..15th Rabi Auwal 1554 (17.6. 35) from Your Excellency's delegates at the conference, on this question held at Kuwait. The Saudi delegates wish this manifest system system to be extended to goods carried by dhows. (2)That customs posts should be established as in head (1) of the Kuwait delegates letter referred to above, and that fixed routes should be specified. (3)That Your Excellency should give a pledge as in the J third para of the letter from the Kuwait delegation to the Saudi delegation, dated 24th Rabi Auwal corresponding to the 25th June 1935. (4)That there should be control of individuals who cross the Kuwait-Nejd frontier for purposes of trade. (5)That there s&amp;ould be a provision in the final agreement that either party can terminate it by an agreed short in M'lln i i 5 •-. .■ .-. t notice.Z. His Majesty's Government farther directed the Hon'ble the Political Resident to inform Your Sxcellency that these proposals seemed to them to afford a prospect of a satisfactory settlement to both parties. Your views on the above proposals were as follows:- (1) Your Excellency agreed to the issue of manifests as already proposed, also Your Excellency agreed to extend such xoanifest system to goods carried by dhows. (2) Your Excellency agreed to the establishment of customs posts, as proposed, also that fixed routes should be specified on the manifests. (3) Your Excellency agreed to give the pledge referred to. (4) Your Excellency stated that while the Saudi Government were entirely at liberty to issue any special permits which they chose to caravan leaders, such as issuing of certificates of Identity, authorizing them to proceed to Kuwait and purchase supplies up to certain limits, or pass through certain customs posts on the inward journey to Kuwait, you yourself must definitely decline to issue any fom of Certificates of Identity, or other control documents at the Kuwait end for outgoing caravans or individuals, as there would neither be need for such action nor would it be practicable seeing that caravans exporting goods would come in from Nejd and go out again, and no Kuwaiti caravans would be engaged in such trade. Your Excellency further stated that all you couM agree to was to issue inaniies^s to caravan leaders giving particulars of goods carried, as well as ordering them (the leaders) to proceed to such and such customs posts. That one copy of the mani fest would be given to the caravan leader, a second to the Saudi trade Agent here, and a third kept by the Kuwait Government - Lastly that the Saudi Grovernment must trust to /our iiixcellency s wordtrust to your Exoellency , s word of honour, to play fair, and see that all other caravans proceeding to Kejd, that happened to come in without documents, travel or otherwise, 7 /ould be given manifests and treated as if they had documents. At the end of your talk ?/ith the Political Resident Your Excellency made it quite clear that the manifest system proposed could and would only apply to organized caravans carrying goods for trade purposes to oaudi ^.rabia, and that on no account could Your Excellency agree to the issue of manifests to poor Badawins coming ^up to Kuwait to buy their daily bread and meagre necessities of life. That such form of shop ping was known as 'musabalah', and was a privilege which could not be denied to the unfortunate tribesmen under any circumstances* Your Excellency added that should the iiaudi Government consider that the petty daily food require ments of the poor tribesmen (whether they lived in Kuwait territory or just across the Nejd or Iraq border came under the category of smuggling, then the responsibility for stopping such must lie with the Saudi Government, not witji you, for you feared God. (5)Your Excellency fully agreed to the proposed time limit. 4 # I should be grateful if Your Excellency would confirm these views by letter, which I shall convey to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

The issue of manifests in triplicate, one to be given to the head of the caravan, the other to the trade agent, an Nafisi, and the third to be kept in the local (Government) office at Kuwait. 2. The establishment of customs posts in the Saudi fronti ers. 3. The establishment of a system to control the persons who cross the Kuwait-Nejd frontiers for the purpose of trade. 4. The promise to give our word of honour to give all possible assistance in the interest of both. That we confirm to you our agreement to these proposals as quoted above.

After Compliments. I have the honour to refer your iCxcellency to this Agency^ letter No.G-31 of 25th January and to ask, should you consider it desirable that para 3 sub para 4 should be amended to read as follows:- ^(4) Your iixcellency stated that while the Jaudi (rovernment were entirely at liberty to issue any special permits which they chose to caravan leaders, such as issuing of certificates of identity, authorizing them to proceed to Kuwait and purchase supplies up to certain limits, or pass through certain customs posts on the inward journey to Kuwait, you yourself must definitely decline to issue any form of certificates of identity, out er other control documents at the Kuwait end for/going caravans or individuals, or allow a Saudi Arab Trade Agent or any other person to issue them in Kuwait, as there would neither be need for such action nor would it be practicable, etc. etc 2, Should you agree to this would you be kind enough to repeat in one letter that you agree with and confirm the version of your views given in the letter and with all the proposals therein made except in so far as your views given in the letter modify or show dissent therefrom^ (There is no need for a summary of the various Saudi Arab proposals in your Excellency's reply.) Secondly would you inform me in 'another' letter if you find the amendment now suggested useful and desirable, in which case I will record and insert the amendment in the original letter.

After Compliments, In continuation of my letter No,R-4/2384, dated the 28th Dhil C^dah 1354 (El,2.36) , I beg to inform you that the points comprising what I discussed 'with the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on 24.1.36 on the subject of the iiaadi trade Blockade of Kuwait, and which you reported in your letter No.C-31, dated the 25th January 1936 - that all the views that I have proposed to the Resident, as given in your letter mentioned above, from para 1 to para 5 are in consistency with my desires, I only except one thing: it is the limitation to of the goods that a trader would take according/the permit he holds, as proposed by the 3audi Government. This question I do not consider to be suitable. My view in this connection is that the trader who, for instance, holds a permit to buy ten loads of commodities, and who at this end thinks of taking more, or vice versa - that such a trader should not be prevented from doing so» There should only be a watch kept for what goods he would take, and a full description of such goods should be given in the manifests issued here. This method I consider as suitable for the convenience and the interests of both sides. As to the question of promise, as I have pointed out to you in my above letter, I give my word of honour to do all assistance possible in the interests of both sides.

He does this in no carping way but with a view to covering all the various difficulties i/hich may arise, if therefore the details already mentioned are used we might find that different constructions were put on them by the Shaikh and the oaudi iirab Government and that when it came to embodying them in an article of agreement or regulations, one or the other'accused the other party of going back on his word o # I fancy that as far as the Saudi Arab Government is concerned^beyond the agreement in principle to the proposals, it would be best to keep them in the dark until we are ready to present them with a draft Kuwait regulations for the control of caravans which with its explanatory letter from the bhaikh should show in a clear fashion how the proposals would work out in detail.

Your instructions were to ascertsin precise significance of Saudi proposals this would presumably mean asking Saudi Government to suggest nature of control to 'be imposed on persons and categories of persons to he subject to it. In other respects Saud's proposals were in my opinion clear. Government of India, go rather further and suggest Saudi Government should be asked to put forward precise draft. This would amount to asking them to make preliminary draft of future Kuwait Regulations which can surely best be done by Kuwait authorities. ^ I evidently read too much into words 'Report no,.' 1„ Kuwait tel.gr.. 77 to Polltlfl M.M.nt. L.rt sentence of India Office telegram 260 to Political Resident dnd previous correspondence lead me to expect that Shaikh of Kuwait and British authorities in the Gulf would in the first instance produce scheme which they considered practicable on the basis of Faud's proposals and would assume that control should be by passes or identity papers,*1 ^' I 4. / Apart from considerations mentioned in my telegram 4* 42 I feel strongly that action contemplated in your instruct ions especially if given form suggested by Government of India will encourage Saudi Government to open their mouths as wide as possible and place Shaikh of Kuwait in a much weaker tactical position than if Saudi-G©vea?fiffien% he made his won draft regulations and left Saudi Government to suggest amendments or amplifications, 5. I have now arranged to see Fuad April ISth, We could not in any case discuss this subject in detail before he leaves, I shall therefore unless instructed otherwise confine myself to tell him that formulation of precise scheme in Kuwait has presented difficulty owing to doubt as to scope of his proposals and that I shall pursue matter with Yusuf Yasin. Fresji start will have to be made with latter. 6. As I have informed Fuad of Shaikh of Kuwait's acceptance (mut) of his proposal I trust points requiring elucidattdm are limited to those indicated in para graph 1 above and that Shaikh of Kuwait's acceptance covers pari dealt with in paragraphs 12 and 15 of enclosure of my despatch 7, Shaikh of Kuwait seems to forget that continuance of present situation suits Saudi Government who have been induced only by strong pressure of His Majesty's Govern ment to contemplate termination of blockade.

Letter then refers to points raised orally with me by Yusuf Yasin regarding possibilities of evasion by persons taking goods ostensibly fcr Iraq but actually f'or smuggling into Saudi Arabia. Although only solution would be for Kuwait to inform Saudi Arabia of all goods leaving Kuwait whether for Saudi Arabia or elsewhere, nevertheless in order not to indispose Government of Kuwait by making such request letter suggests modification of Article 1 (for text of which see my immediately succeeding telegran). 3. Saudi Government consider it necessary that there should be agreement as to 'manner' of punishment of smugglers when Kuwaiti subjects and when Saudi subjects. 4. Regarding goods leaving Kuwait by sea, boat owners on return to Kuwait should be in possession of certificate to prove that goods carried to Saudi Arabian ports actually reached their destination. 5.

Jir, KUWAIT - BLOCKADE. f I have-' the honour to refer to your letter No,0-195 of the 2nd October 1956 and to say that I have ascertained His Excellency the Shaiich's reactions to the first four paragraphs of the Saudi Note and that he has in this connectlet written to me a letter k copy of which is attached. v - f ^ A 2 # On handing His Excellency the copy of the first four paragraphs of the Saudi Note I pointed ^o what I said was an obvious slip in drafting in the penultimate sentence of para 2 of the note* The sentence beginning n No bedouin' as it stood would mean if accepted, that no Bedouin even a Kuwaiti camped within two miles of the walls, could leave Kuwait without a pass from a Saudi Arab official. His iixcellency on reauing it said immediately 'Not a slip but intentional'. His Excellency in conversation later informed me that he feared that Ibn Saud instead of being content with the quite adequate regulations devised was, by an amendment, trying to achieve not simply the end of the blootode but increased influence and con tool over Kuwait. 1 | ^ ^ 3o His demand for an official to accompany the , dictated by this reason. Most caravans was he thought qic . f . rnm Neid. and Saudi Arab caravan caravans would start from j icaravan officials would thus predominate over the Kuwait ones in Kuwait, and soon he feared be unnecessarily officious in the exercise of their duties. Agreement to such a condition would also probably encourage the Iraq Government to press anew for their Customs Officer to be established in Kuwait. Para 6 of His Excellency's reply attached seems reasonable♦ It would be inhuman to turn such poor creatures away. Ibn Saud, His Excellency thinks, here again sees a means of forcing the Shaildi of Kuwait into carrying out, as if he were subordinate to Ibn Saud, what is his, Ibn Saud^, own affair; the control of those from within his frontiers, who may wish to cross it either for legal or illegal purposes. His Majesty as is well known already does so most effectively when he wishes. 5 # Para 7 of His Excellency's letter seems reasonable. An additional reason for having more frequent caravans is that camels often find only poor grazing near the walls here and caravans should therefore be free to leave as early as possible after being ready • Perhaps caravans twice a week would be suitable, if there must be fixed times. 6 With regard to the matter of punishment His Sxcellenoy informs that on aooeptanoe of the Regulations he is willing to agree to anything reasonaole which His Majesty would apply to his own subjects, 7&gt; in short His jaccellency's reaction to the note is this. He maintains that in return for a reasonable proposal which would end the blockade and safeguard both parties the Note betrays an anxiety to achieve more and gain what the blockade itself was perhaps largely designed to gain, i.e.- 3 « 88is ^9M. ''30.'; i # e» a degree of Saudi control over 1 Kuwait. 8. His Sxcellenoy thought from what he had heard that it was however only an attempt and that Ibn Saud was in reality prepared to agree to the original draft, if necessary, and particularly at the present time. I have the honour to be, Sir, our most obedient servant, Captain, Political Agent, Kuwait. fTranslation of a confidential letter No.H-5/251, dated the 22nd Rajab 1355, corresponding to the 8th October 1956, from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After Compliments, / I have the honour to reply to your letter No .C-286 dated the 17th Rajab 1S55 CS#10.36), embodying contents of th communication received from His Majesty King Abdul Aziz as- Saud through His Majesty's Government, in connection with the Regulations for the Opening of Trade between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which I have well understood, 2 # I would like to inform you that I appreciate the spirit of sympathy and amity shown during the discussions At the same time I highly appreciate the great efforts that are being made by His Majesty's Government to get to success the question of 'Musabala' between Saudi Arabia Lx \ *io and Kuwait♦ /h s 3 # I assure to your Excellency that the proposals contained in the regulations forwarded under co^^r of my letter No.R-5/67, dated the 2Srd Safar 1355 (14.5.36), will suffice to meet the case for safeguarding the interests of both sides. I again assure to your Excellency that I shall not fail to do the best in my power to protect the rights of all by all possible and effective means# 4. As for the supposition that there might be some people who would export goods in the name of 'Iraq, but who would smuggle them into Saudi Arabia or elsewhere, this very unlikely. Moreover, both ours as well as Saudi -irab officials -will be a^e to keep strict observation over such attempts. Nevertheless, I consider that it is very unlikely that such a matter will arise, because it would be / impracticable®- 2 - b# LOr t ' lie men ' bio ^ in the above communication that every caravan should be accompanied by a special offi cial to the first province, and that such official should hold a list containing the number of camels of the caravan and the names of the persons thereof; should there be among them some person or persons whose names are not included in the list, and who carry goods with them, we would naturally consider them as smugglers, and that they should receive deterrent punishments* But I see no necessity for sending a special official in company with the caravan. The best way would be that the Head of the caravan should be made directly responsible for his caravan. At the same time there should be a strict observation by the officials of both sides. Above all the triplicate manifest will exactly include all the goods, large and small, carried by the caravan. This will be a sufficient substitute for the company of any special official and any bill beside the abovementioned manifests. 6. In connection with the 'Musabala' (Shopping or restocking) of the bedouins, I have no objection to their carrying papers from the Saudi Arab Posts or Stations. But in case of the arrival in Kuwait of individuals or parties of bedouins who could not conveniently call at the abovementioned Stations, for the purpose of taking their provisions from Kuwait, it would not be of any good for either side to prevent such poor bedouins from taking their provisions. 7. I should also like to draw your attention to the fact that limiting the number of Journeys for caravans and notifying the Government of their departure would be a hindrance to the circulation of business dealings, and would affect the state of supply and demand in undue proportion particularly to small traders who are the great majority. I trust that you will sympathize with me in the idea o,.idea of avoiding anything which would tend to generate ooiamercial distress of the public. 8. As to the suggestion that there should be an agreement about the manner in which smugglers should be punished when they are Kuwait subjects, and the manner in which saiugglers should be punished when they are Saudi subjects, such an agreement will be quite possible in the end* 9. As to what would be exported from Kuwait by sea to the Saudi Arab ports, owners of the boats shall be bound to bring the necessary certificates to prove that the goods they carried arrived at their destination.

The Saudi proposal that every caravan should be accompanied by a special officer of the Government of iaiwait or the baudi .arab Government to fixed frontier posts# Your Excellency pointed out that it was not clear whether the Saudi proposal meant that Saudi officials should accompany caravans from the frontier to Kuwait and back to the frontier. If the proposal meant this then Your Excellency could not agree to it since once the caravans were on the Kuwait side of the frontier, the responsibility for their surveillance aod safe conduct v/as obviously yours, and you could not allow officials of foreign Government to exercise authority in your territory. The Resident asked what were your views if 'the baudi Govermient meant that caravans should be accompanied by Kuwaiti officials. our Excellency said that you did not see any useful object in this proposal, as the caravan leaders would be provided with manifests from which the goods with the caravan could easily be checked. However, if the ^auoi uoveinment laid store by this you were prepared to agree, at an?/ 1 ite 01 the trial period of six months which is mentioned be . low. B. .71th re mrd to the oau dl proposal to limit the number of caravans per month#. Your jixcellency stated in paragraph of your letter quoted above that the limitation of caravans would hinder trade. The Resident is of the opinion that some- s - some limitation of caravans is necessary ?or the working of the system, but that their number is a detail which can be settled according to requirements of trade vtien the ^-reement came into force. C /fhat no bedouin shoula be allowed to carry ^ood s from Kuwait unless they hold a special written per- mission rrom the &gt;-ai-ial frontier official concerned , also tliao such -Dedouirj. should leave Kuwait in caravans* Your iSxcellency pointed out timt this was impossible * since large numbers of Bedouin come daily into Kuwait to make small purchases, and it would be quite impracticable to insist that each of them should have written permission for this purpose, or that they should leave Kuwait only in caravans• However Your Excellency was prepared to give a pledge that on this point, as on all others, you were prepared to do in your utmost to see that smuggling did not occur. In this connection Your Excellency pointed out that you and. your officials knew what the needs of the Bedouin were and w© could check any excessive purchases which might be made with intent to smuggle* D. The Saudi su^estion that there should be en agreement about the riBmer in vfliich smugglers should be punished when th qy are Kuwaiti subjects and the manner in which fcmi-^lers should be punished when they are Saudi subjects* Your Excellency 1 s reply to this was thcxt naturally the extent of the penalty would depend on 1iie magnitude of the offence, and that you would use your discretion in inflicting suitable punishments. aaudl pT-nnosal as to control of goods which leave I, Kuwait by sea» Your Bxoellenoy quite agreed that this was reasonable precaution and that owners of boats, on their- 5 - on 'tli g ip i etum uo K ^ ci i g , sliouici oc in posssssion oj T u . certificate to prove that the goods tliey carried to ^auai Arab posts reached their destination. 2» ifinally the -^esident expi*essed the opinion that the best course would be for the systan to be given trial for a period of (say) six months, during which it could be seoi how the regulations worked in practice and whether any further points for settlement, which could not be foreseen now, would arise. At the enc. of that period either party woulc be free to denounce the -ugreenent with a view to the alteration of any part of the regulations which was found to be either unworkable car injurious to its interests. Your iiscellency agreed to this suggestion. 3. I ^iould be grateful if Your Excellency would confirm that the above is a correct statement of your views. 11 Usual ending.5 fs v r.ONFlDENTIAL No. The Political Agent at Kuwait presents his compliments to The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf , BU3HIH.3. and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned document(s), {BUSHIRE^Efiinp: ' sr y ^&lt;FiDZ iTlAL RECORDS POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT.

On the other hand I appreciate the Saudi point of view, which is presumably that by the Bedouin making a large number of small purchases excessive to their needs, stores could be accumulated in the desert to be smuggled across the frontier as oppor tunity offered. The only solution appears to be that suggested by the Shaikh,^that he and his officials will exercise a personal check on such purchases« D of Political Agent ! s letter. I concur with the Shaikh's views, jS of Political Agents letter. No comments. 4* Paragraph 2 of Political Agent 's letter. It seems to me that my suggestion for concluding a provisional agreement for a period of six months might well be given a trial. 5. The situation therefore is as follows. (l) Of the Shaikh's 10 regulations forwarded under jTl ^ my printed letter Ho.403 dated the 19th May 1936 Nos#2 to 10 have been agreed to by the Saudi Government as a basis for discussion f vide paragraph 6 of letter dated the 17th A'V August /August 1936 from Yusuf Yasin to Mr.Calvert. (2). With regard to Regulation I the Saudis have made the additions A and B and E referred to above# A is acceptable to the Shaikh provid ed the officials are Kuwaiti and not Saudi, B can be settled from the experience gained in the working of the Agreement, B is acc epta tie and can be included in the Regula tion* (3), The Saudis have further proposed 0. This is not acceptable to the Shaikh, (4)o The Saudis have also proposed D. This the Shaikh does not consider necessary, nor is it important • 6« It ^ill thus be seen that of their demands the only important one which the Saudi Government do not secure is C. This being so I venture to suggest that they might be asked to conclude a provisional agreement (vide my paragraph 4 above) which does not provide for this desideratum* sd.

Shaikh has already agreed to (a).

It is of course in Shaikh's own interest to facilitate Ambassador's task and His Majesty »s Government can see no objection to (b) particularly since Iraqis can easily obtain information direct from Saudis and it would be much better for them to have it from His Majesty's Government.

In any case we nave never dealt witil tms point and tuat yaudi Government snould rel'er to it again can nardly be considered unreasonable. I snail continue trying to induce tnem to waive it, Tney or course realise tnat W alternative proposal liice any otner rresn point is subject to your approval. Prom tne Kuwai t side Ibn Saud must appear purely obstructive, I can only say tnat according to a conridential message he sent me recently ne regards Snaii^n as directing smuggling and snaring- in its prol its. rusul Yes in states tna t one-third of tne revenue of Hasa is lost by smuggling which is so serious that several smugglers have been executed recently. - BULjARD.

Ho*47* Repeated Political Resident, Bushire, at Muscat* No*d # Dated and received the 24th April, J.937. I7'1 My telegram Ho.39. KUWAIT BLOGKADS, Saudi Grovernment have dropped proposal that caravans should be accompanied officials and only leave on fixed days and that no bedouin should be allowed to maice purchases unless he has a Saudi permit for that purpose but they consider it essential that all retail (omission ? purchaser )s should leave Kuwait in parties and observe caravan procedure. They also require provision to ensure that duplicate of manifest shall reach their agent in Kuwait before departure of caravan or party. 2. They maintain their request that BON VOISINAGE and SXTRABITIOH agreements should come into ferce simultaneous- ly with Trade agreement. To the suggestion that an .., - experimental period of 12 or 6 months might prove their • . — ■ - - ■ - - request to be unnecessary they say such a period would be too short to establish the failure or success of the expensive and elaborate organisation required and that to denounce the agreement however unsuccessful would be highly invidious. They therefore prefer agreement for say three years in the first instance on conditions which they believe to be adequate. I realise that this can be interpreted as desire to secure a permanent hold over Kuwait but please see I i % second paragraph of my telegram No.39. Ub^ ^ 3.

It Is not suggestec that Nejdis coming to Kuwait should come in caravans, s or. that the Shaikh's fears of a large number of Nejdl officials exercising authority in Kuwait appear to be unfounded. Paragraph 6. This is the crux of the matter. 'Jn~ less the Shaikh agrees to some form Sf control of •muEabala' no agreement is likely to result. If Saudi caravans are accompanied by an official, per haps he could be authorised to illo^ casual bedoain to purchase and Join a caravan at Kuwait. Paragraph 7.
