I enclose copies of 2 demi-official letters from McDouall. The first, dated a th Sepatember l o 04, is about the arms. I had just left Bushire on tour when this arrived, and it was opened and kept by Trevor,and subsequently,before returning to Bushire I visited Ahwaz and the question of the arms was broached to me verbally. I think the letter might be kept on record in case the Shaikh should ever revert to the subject. I did not know of it until after I addressed Mr Praser on 2^th January last. The second enclosure is Mr. McDouall's reply to my letter sending him the purport of your communication of 21st April Please note the last sentence. My recollection was that only the question of mortgage on the site of the Consulate had been discussed, but I have no doubt McDouall is correct The Shaikh's object,no doubt, in wishing to mortgage his lands to Crovernment is, on the one hand, to hedge againstagainst possible Persian oppres ion in the future, and at the same time to give Government vested interests in his territory ajid in the preservation of his integrity and immunity from such oppression. I doubt if the suggestion will commend itself to the Government of India any more than that regarding the acquis- ition of arms did, but it is hard to know how to deal vrith is these references and I think it best to report them demi- officially in order to ascertain the views of Government and then let the Shaikh have a definite answer. If I do not they are sure to be repeated at some future time. Yours Sincerely (Sd) ?. Z.

Posr&lt;,tion of the Govt: of India as regards the site. (3). Construction of the buildings, &amp; the terms on which the Govt: of India are to occupy them. The first of these after much discussion appears to be A' fj ifct Ifl:: 1 I H I Kftli I I, I I Our No: 43 of 29-1-06 para 6. fx S For: No: 1252 3.A. of L 29-3-05 para 2a.

The Sheikh would have doubtless been quite willing to sell the land to the Govt: of India, but owing to the attitude of the Persian Govt, its sale outright was impracticable. It was therefore suggested by the Sheikh that he should mortgage the land to us, thereby giving I the British Govt: a vested interest in Ahwaz, which i would be an indirect protection to himself. In commenting on this suggestion the Govt: of India propose that they should 'lend the Sheikh a sum of money on the security of the proposed site, the amount to be not greater than the market value of the site'.In reply r to this Mr. Lorimer points out that the total value of the proposed site would not probably be more than roughl Rs 3677, asum so small that the Sheikh would not have the least desire to borrow it,&amp; which it would be in no way a benifit to us to lend him. He further adds that heM'hmrh.: No: 16 of 22-4-05 para 3. L does not; think any reference will be made to the value of the site unless raised by us, &amp; from a remark fiwnwRtfifl he makes in para 3 of his letter No: 92 of 20-2-05 ' A appears to favour the rent or mortgage rates of the land being included in th® house rent. With this opinion Mr- McDouall agrees remarking that he does not thAnk the question of rent should be raised as separate from Our No: 43 of 29-1-06 para 4. &lt;5 s u/t *3 para 6 B. para 6 B b. 7 £ rent of building. If these opinions are concurred in , it would result in no actual cash passing into the hands of the Sheikh over the transaction, until such time as the cost of the building had been paid off by recovery out of the rent,the Govt; of India*s proposal only pro viding for a loan on the security of the site. This is a result tJae Sheikh might possibly not view with great favour. Construction of th'g buiiaings&gt; &amp; terms on which the Govt: of India are to occupy them. In an interview between Major Cox &amp; the Sheikh, at which Mr. McDouall &amp; Haji Rais were both present, two alternatives were put forward. (A)That the Sheikh should build the houses from our de signs and rent them to us at a fixed percentage on the cost. (B &gt;That the Govt: should »rect the premises at theifc own expense &amp; by their own arrangement, and hand the B houses over when completed to the Sheikh recovering the cost out of the rent, 7 In this interview the Sheikh shewed a preference for the f- Our 502 of 11-4-05 latter course, but (according to Haji Hais)appeared to para 4. A Z 1 7 . , r - have changed his mind later* in favour of the former, (vid^. 9 u/\ r Mr,McDouall 1 s D.O. letter to Mr. Lorimer dated 10-3-05) On reference however by Major Cox regarding this point Awz: No: 145 of Lorimer says that he does not think the Sheikh has ^8-4-05 para 3, /i St in any way repented of his original proposal &amp; would be jj quite willing for Govt; to do tiie building in his namej* For: 1252 3.A. or 27-3-05 paras 2 c • (3. • © • S6A C. c ^ and recover the outlay through thB rent, provided was represented by a man of his own,who could satisfy himself as to the nature of the expenditure &amp; the correctness of the accounts. $ With regard to this part of the question the Govt: of India express their complete willingness to have to have the building constructed at their own expense provided such outlay is repaid at the same time as any loan advanoed on the security of the site &amp; provided that on expiry of such repayment,the Sheikh should enter into an agreement with us leasing the building for a period of say 30 years at rent calculated at say 596 on the total expenditure by Govt: , all repairs to be undertaken by the latter during the period of q such lease. Mr. Lorimer remarks that though ordinary rates of interest in Persia ' 1 are much higher,(Messrs. Lynch paying 15^),he thinks that in view of the large sum involved the Sheikh might well be contented with 5 to 6 ^6. Mr. McDouall agrees with this, (vide his No: 16 of 22-4-05).

S^J S&lt;cA 3) a lih, o does so before a definite understanding has been come t * to between the Sheikh &amp; the Moin regarding ownership of the site. He summarises the opinions expressed by Consuls Ahwaz &amp; iThomrah, the net result of which are ioudt:[ocj ft is (1).That the question of the rent of the site as sep arate from that of the building be dropped. ic~dlrs. H (2).That the site &amp; premises thereon,when built, are the property of the Sheikh. (&amp;) ^ f7 (3). That in consideration of a certain sum of money (which is really the actual original outlay on the buildings),having been loaned to the Sheikh, we shall be allowed to occupy the building for a period of 20 years free of rent, given that if rent wa.a paid it would be at the rate of 5$ on ■ the outlay i.e. the loan. That after this for a further period of 30 years we shall pay rent cal culated at the same rate as above.S faj (4) That on no account is the Sheikh ajs any time to ceds, lease, or sell the site or building without con-f of the Govt: of India. The cash advantages therefore accruing to the Sheikh from the above proposals are that after 20 years,for a piece of land which is at present practically valueless, he will obtain a sure income calculated fixed at a certain percentage on the outlay. 3025 3.A. of 06. /t lt&gt;/ sty n % S Ujx, o r In replyings^he Govt: of India decline giving their approval to the above proposals or the ground that an effort should first be made to induce the Sheikh &amp; the Moin to come to an agreement as to the owner- shdp of the land. 72 This brings us down to the presert time. The only point now to be considered would seem to be whether owing to a settlement having been come to regarding the ownership of the land,any modifications should be introduced into Major Cox's proposals. As the proposals stand we have a more or less solid claim on the land at a fixed rent for a period of 50 years for certain,&amp; a possible extension for a still further period after that.In view of the fact that purchase outright is impracticable I do not see how they could be bettered. Greater security might perhaps be obtained by insert ing in para 4 condt; (b) of our letter 291 of 23-6-05 the words 'and the site on which they are built' after the word 'they' &amp; before the words 'shall be leased'. The prolongation of our claim might be still further secured by the introduction of some vlause to the effect that the only method of repaying the loan shoul be by recovery out of tne rent. This however would I presume toe impracticable as it would undoubtedly rouse the suspicions of the Sheikh. There would seem to be no particular advantage inin obtaining a mortgage on the site. It would inly complicate matters by introducing two separate questio71s into the agreement, viz,(l&gt; a loan on the security of the site &amp; (2&gt; a further loan for the construction of the buildings. ji-1 have not noted on the area or actual dimensions of the consulate site as this is a question which could only be finaSO^ settled by Capt: Lorimer on the spot.

From— M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have tlie honour to refer to the correspondence ending 'with Foreign Department letter No. 2168-E.A., dated 24th May 1906, regarding the acquisi tion of a site for the erection of Vice-Consular buildings at Ahwaz. 'When the latter communication was received Captain Lorimer was on tour at Ispahan, and he had no opportunity of pursuing the negociations further until th(} end of November, when NoTem'beTiooG to Ee8i&lt;3ent ' ^ 0 ^ 654, date&lt;J ^ 5tb he submitted the report, of which a copy is now enclosed. 2. The results of the discussion which took place bet ween the Sheikh, Haji Rais and His Majesty's Yice-Consul, were not of a nature to enable me to lay any definite proposal before Government which had the Sheikh's concurrence. I decided, therefore, before submitting any further statement of the position, to take an early opportunity of interviewing the latter on the subject in the hope of being able to arrive at a more precise understanding with him. I visited him in due course on 15th instant in company with Mr. McDouall, and have the honour to report the result. 3. I should premise hero with reference to paragraphs 9 to 13 of Captain Lorimer's letter enclosed, that while, on the one hand, it seemed to me undesirable to entertain the idea of offering Haji Eais a bribe; on the other I arrived at the decided conclusion, alter discussing the position with Mr, McDouall, that it would be impolitic and probably useless to attempt to ignore him, especially in view of the fact that the recent marriage of the Haji's daughter to Sheikh Khazal's heir-apparent must be considered to have given him a further vested interest in the fortunes of the Ruler of Mohammerah if not a reasonable title to participate in his councils. Haji Eais was accordingly present at our interview with the Sheikh and took part in the negociation. 4. I think the terms now offered must be regarded as the best that we are likely to obtain from the Sheikh, for in the course of our interview I bad let him know in a friendly and confidential way that when Government originally decided upon appointing a Vice-Consul for Arabistan, both Dizful and Similiter as well as Ahwaz had been considered as alternative selections for the head-quarters of the Consulate, and that while I personally favoured Ahwaz as slightly the more convenient place for present requirements, it was quite possible that if the terms obtainable at Ahwaz appeared to them too prohibit tive, the Government of India would revert to the consideration of one of the other centres mentioned. 5. A lengthy discussion resulted in the alternative offers on the part of the Sheikh. Alternative I— («) the Government of India to provide the necessary funds; (i) rent to be assessed at 8 per cent, per annum on the total cost of the buildings; (&lt;?) Of the amount resulting under (b) 4 per cent, to be paid to the Sheikh in 12 monthly instalments. The other moiety to be recredited to Government in liquidation of loan account within 25 years during which the Government of India W'ould have the possession of the house and grounds as their security. {d) On the expiry of 25 years the Sheikh to have the option of revising the terms of the lease before renewal for a further period with the proviso that the Government of India be offered the first refusal of any terms decided upon. Alternaiive IT— (tc) The Government of India to provide the funds as in Alternative T. crystallization of the followingJ (a:) Rent to be nssessed at 6 per cent, instead of 8 per cent, and to be withheld by Government until the expenses of erection are wiped off. (y) In this case the Sheikh to have the option of reTising the terms of the lease after 20 years instead of 25 as in Alternative I. (z) In view of this reduction in the rent percentage from 8 per cent, to 6 per cent, the Government of India to lend Sheikh Khazal, as an entirely independent transaction, a sum of two lakhs of rupees at 5 per cent per annum on the security of the title deeds of property worth that amount belonging to the Sheikh in Turkish territory. The loan to be repayable within 10 years. With reference to these title deeds I may mention that Mr. McDouall informed me confidentially that similar deeds were some years ago secretly deposited with one of Messrs. Lynch's Agents as security for a loan of £5,000 to the Sheikh. The loan was duly repaid and the deeds returned, but in the case of the deposit of such documents with Government as security, the question of the validity of the documents and the transaction, vis a vis the Turkish Government would be a pregnant one. I gather that the Sheikh is not in actual need of this loan for any special purpose, but makes the proposal as a business transaction. *If from a similar point of view the Government of India favour this alternative scheme to that first mentioned, I am inclined to think that the loan of two lakhs to Sheikh Kbazal at 5 per cent, on Ms own bond may be regarded as reasonably safe investment in itself and that the Government of India will probably prefer not to handle the Turkish title deeds, relying upon their general line of policy in regard to the Ruler of Mohammerah to assure the safety of their investment. 6. If either of the two broad proposals formulated above commend them selves for acceptance and the fact is communicated to me by telegram, a detailed agreement might be drafted and submitted for approval, unless the Government of India prefer, as they possibly will, to communicate their reply to Sheikh Khazal's proposal accompanied by a draft agreement drawn up in the Toreign Department in terms which they consider suitable.

Cox, C .I .E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to your No. 1319, dated 12th June 1906, enclosing correspondence dealing with the subject of the arrangement of terms with the Sheikh of Mohammerah for the building of a house for the Vice-Con sulate here. 2. On the 20th Haji Rais called on me and showed me much curiosity on the subject which I showed no great eagerness to gratify, as it was obvious from his tone that he was trying to establish his indispensability as the medium of negociations. When I said that I hop^d to visit the Sheikh a couple of days later when we could all three discuss the matter togetlier, the Rais replied that if I let him know our terms, he would be able to work in our interests on the Sheikh before I met him. Afterwards he recounted at length how he had served Messrs. Lynch Brothers in a similar situation for a sum of three hundred tomans verbally promised but eventually not paid. He then spoke of the contracts which we would have to give for bricks stone, labour, etc., and said he would take them all up at better rates than any one else might offer us. 3. These three things were transparently obvious from his conversation. Pirst, that he is going to prove his indispensability to us in the nejrociations, second, that his recompense for services of this kind 'rendered, must be a consi derable sum in cash guaranteed in advance, third, that he looks forward to .ymaking a srnall fortune by appearance in the cliaracfer of our one and only friend when it comes to practical work. ^ 4. On the 22nd I went and called on the Sheikh at Muzaffariya. The Rais was present. On broaching tlie subject it was at once evident that the Rais had commenced operations and that the Sheikh was primed. Ihe following were the demands made. That the area of the site and the area covered by buildings should be determined, in order that a separate rent should be tixed for tlie land not occupied by buildings. As regards the rent of the building, if Sheikh found the money, the rent was to be calculated at the 15 per cent, on the total expenditure. If the money was lound by us similarly at 10 per cent. In the latter case the loan would be refunded by remission.of half the rent till suoh time as repayment was completed. 5. In reply I said that these terms were quite impossible for us. To give myself some room for yielding, I suggested first that the land only should be leased to us at a fixed rental, and that we should do what work of construction we liked at our own expense. The building remaining ours and the land the Sheikh's. Otherwise we should find the money for the Sheikh to build, and rent at 5 per cent, on outlay should be fixed. TVe should recover the amount of the loan by paying no rent for 20 years. After 20 years the rent should be fixed at, say, 3 per cent, on outlay. The first of these proposals were declared impossible and the latter wholly unprofitable. 6, There was a great deal of talking, with not too much sincerity I think on the Sheikh's part. He said that by buildinsr Caravanserais at Mohammerah, etc., he could get a return of 15 per cent, on his money, VVe suggested 5 per cent. Would the Indian Government lend him 20 or, say, 10 lakhs of rupees at 5 percent.? r I said I thought it very probably would—on adequate security. I would make it a separate matter of reference if he desired. The rent of the Consulate at Mohammerah had been fixed at 12 per cent., and this made it out of the question to discuss lower terms. The cases, it may be remarked, are not parallel. The sum spent on the Mohammerali Consulate must have been comparatively trifling, and a high rate of rent was necessary to make the rental a matter of consideration at all. The value of land would rise in Nasiri and that of the Vice-Consulate building would also increase with time, and w T e are fixing a rent for the inde finite future. I only quote these few remarks as samples from a long and fruitless con versation. On my part I refused all hopes of our accepting a higher rats than 5 per cent., or the imposition of rent tor the unoccupied parts of the site apart from that for the buildings. I eventually took my leave leaving the matter in this position. 8. The crux of the whole affair is Haji Rais. This disreputable but crafty little adventurer has made himself indispensable to the Sheikh, and so has obtained to all appearance decisive control over his counsels. He has long been accustomed to use his position to rob and bully the European and Native inhabitants of Arabistan. He is now determined to turn what he deems our necessities to pecuniary advantage. 9. There are two lines of treatment of Haji Eais open to us. We mav follow his scarcely veiled suggestion to bribe him. His price I have made no endeavour to ascertain having decided for the present to ignore his suggestion, but I do not fancy that less than £300 to £500 would secure him. To what extent he could obtain the satisfaction of our wishes is also at present uncertain, but I incline to think that this rests with himself.4 10 SlioTild this course be decided on, I would be disposed fo require him to arrange that the site be lensed to us either on an arbitrarily fixed rental, or on one fixed in proportion to the expenditure on the buildings, and that the buildings themselves should be erected by us and remain our property so long as we paid rent for the site. On our censing to pay the rent the building to lapse to the Sheikh. Whether the Rais could arrange this is open to question, but it would be worth trying for, and our prMcticnl security would not, I think, be lessened, though we would have not 'bound ' the Sheikh by a loan. Bribery, or to call it by the Rais's name ' Haq-ul-Zahmat ' (claims for seryices or trouble), is objectionable enough in principle, and in the present case to me personally repulsive. 11. The alternative to squaring the Kais- is to ignore him, mnintnin our present claims, and leave the Sheikh and the Rais to solve the dilemma before them of choice between accepting our ^reasonable proposals, and sacrificing some degree of cordiality in our relations to their own pecuniary interests. The Sheikh left to himself would, I think, choose the former. The Rais will be governed by his own interests as he conceives them, and may in turn govern the Sheikh's decision. 12. The Rais has two aims, one to make sure of some money now, the other to secure a large income in the future by obtaining the contracts for labour and material for the building. On the latter head I declined to give him any assurance, and shall continue to decline to do so. The question is, does he think that in the case of arriving at the point of building he can by one means or another compel us to employ him ? If he does, we have only to hold oat in the matter of the terms of the lease and in the end rather than let tlie affair fall through, he will force their acceptance on the Sheikh. On the other hand if he thinks it possible that in the building work we will be able to ignore him and make our own arrangements, then he will certainly not stir a hand to secure our demands at the present juncture, and the decision will rest with the Sheika biassed or controlled in all probability by the adverse advice of the Rais. 13. The actual facts of the cnse I am unable to determine with absolute certainty myself. The Rais's powers of secretly raising obstructions to work in this country are undoubtedly very great, and his powers of assisting work are also very great. 'Whether or not he could without showing his hand create difficulties for us in obtaining supplies or bricks, lime, etc., in Shushter, and render the residence of Shushteri or other outside labourers in Nasiri difficult, or simply raise rates against us all round, he certainly could obtain these supplies and labourers at cheaner rates than any one else and so practically leave us no alternative to accepting his services. Whether in the long run we should be allowed to benefit is another matter. He would want, to turn them entirely to his own sole pecuniary advantage. He is a very hard man in a bargain, and his plausibility and position protect him in fraud. 14. It remains to contemplate the eventual result if, ignoring the Rais, we fail to induce the Sheikh to come round to our terms. In such a case it is open to us either to revise our terms, or to investigate the possibility of leasing or purchasiug a site at Shushter or Dizful. I spe no reason to alter the views put forward at length in my No. 44, dated 25th July 1904, and I continue to regard Ahwaz as the most advantageous locality for the Vice-Consulate, but w r ork could be carried on at these places and this saves us from the necessity of finally giving in to the Sheikh. There is therefore no reason why we should feel ourselves under constraint and act in discussion with the Sheikh as though we thought he held a pistol to our head. G I C. P. 0. No. 5C95 F.

The lower part is built chiefly of kiln bricks, the upper of sun-dried bricks except on outside. Total cost 42,000 Krans, at then rate of exchange Rs. 16,800. Rent at 9 per cent. 3,780 Krans per annum. Details are enclosed. The site was reclaimed from the river, and embankment work was done by forced labour. Bricks were chiefly brought from a distance of one mile only. I am of opinion that this would not be a reliable guide to building at the present day the price of everything having increased and that of the Kran decreased. During the time the house was being built the pound sterling was worth on an average 36 Krans and is now worth about 55 Krans. Cost in sterling would be a more reliable guide.
