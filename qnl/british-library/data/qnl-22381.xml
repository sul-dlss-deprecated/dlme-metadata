Kilmun anchoring opposite Dubai, that when the British Government wished to instal a lighthouse in Tunb at the time of Sir Percy C®x, H.B.M’s Political Agent in the Persian Gulf, he obtained a permission from your late father Shaikh Saqr bin Khalid. Letters were exchanged between your late father and Sir Percy C©x and the letters were inserted in the official agreement till now. It is not known t© the British Government that your father had given the Tunb Island te the Government of Ras al Khaimah. Therefore according te precedent letters the British Government regards that Tunb belongs to the Government of Sharjah, moreover the Ruler ©f Ras al Khaimah does not attend to the Island to appoint his representative ©r to hoist the flag in it every day as you sent to Abu Musa. The warships visited there (Abu Musa) and found the flag and saw the representative, but no one in the Tunb Island. Therefore, H.B.M’s Political Agent and the Admiral instructed me t© ask you t© send at ©nee your representative with a flsg to the Tunb Island in quickest way. I hope that you will send without delay and idleness. The consequence will be praised by the British Government. Usual endingfT ''HV i, ,(9 IN THE NAI'4E OF 00D, THE COMPASSIONATE AND THE MERCIFUL.

I shall now proceed as quickly as possible to try to locate the places mentioned on the ground, and do the same with his neighbours’ claims, and see if the result brings us any nearer to being able to plot a frontier for Sharjah on a map. It is encouraging at first sight to see that Abu Salaf and A1 Sirra in the North and al Habab and al Awair in the South agree with the claims of^ Umm al Qaiwain and Dubai respectively, but a little disconcerting to find quite wide unclaimed tracts at no great distance from the coast - though I do not suppose that they will long remain unclaimed. The best map I have so far seen of the area is the latest Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) 1: 200,000 map, and I should like to use it if I can get a copy, and if you see no oojection to the frontiers being plotted on it.

On its receipt I referred the question of boundaries to Sir Rupert Hay and opined that we should try and fix them provisionally for all the Sheikhdoms. I said that in view of the Dubai-Abu Dhabi precedent, we should not try to obtain the agreement of the Shaikhs to them or their piior.agreement to accept any decision made by us; we would merely announce them and state perhaps that in the absence of any further evidence we would act upon them as announced. We would inform I.P.C. of them, at the same time emphasising that they were provisional. The Saudi attitude makes it impossible for us to finalise them. 2. I would like you now to take up this question with a tfiew to P.O.T.C’s ultimately reporting to me after exa mination of all the factors involved what the boundaries of the Trucial States should be. I think you will find it easier to commence from the northern end where I think there is likely to be less controversy. You probably have copies of such past papers and maps as they are, but at some stage you or ?/ilton (most likely Wilton) will probably have to look for and at previous papers in this Agency and in the Residency - in the latter some of the papers regard ing the Saudi Arabian Frontier negotiations - where I think the Sultan of Muscat has once committed himself so far as to say what he thought his boundaries ought to be. far with this before Wilton returns, but it would probably be helpful if you could start. It is a pity that one officer cannot undertake the work since in that case it might be possible to announce a decision before the begin ning of next hot weather. 4.

At the request of Sir Rupert Hay I am asking Michell to examine this question so that the P.O.T.C. can report in due course what the boundaries should be. We would hope then be able to announce atleast provi sional boundaries which would enable you to get on with your work. Yours sinc 0 ^ 01 - B.H.
