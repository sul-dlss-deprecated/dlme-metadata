The notice was signed by Charles Geoffrey Prior, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 12 September 1939, and issued by the Political Agency in Bahrain on 15 September 1939.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002d9#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002d9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
