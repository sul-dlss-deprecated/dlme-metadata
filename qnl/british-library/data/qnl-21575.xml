General Head Quarters, Indian Expeditionary Force ' D.' 3rd September igif. From GENERAL SIR J. E. NIXON, K.C.B., Commanding Indian Expeditionary Force ' D,' To T he CHIEF of the GENERAL STAFF, ARMY HEAD QUARTERS, INDIA. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a report by Major C. E. H, Wintle, 96th Berar Infantry, on the operations at Dilwar between the 10th and 16th August 1915. A copy of the report submitted to the Admiralty and the Commander-in- Chief, East Indies, by Captain D. St. A. Wake, R. N., Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, is also attached. 2. Owing to certain difficulties in regard to the light, soundings and prevail ing ' shamal ', the landing was delayed until the fourth day after arrival off Dilwar ; the enemy, therefore, had ample warning to make preparations to oppose the landing, of which they appear to have taken considerable advantage. It seems that they were led by a white officer, possibly a Turk, and their bearing and behaviour generally were considerably superior to what had been expected. 3. I consider that Major Wintle and the troops under his command carried out their work in a satisfactory manner, under somewhat trying and difficult conditions. The incident referred to of the salvo falling short, was unfortunate, but under the circumstances explained by the Senior Naval Officer no blame can be attached to any one. Owing to the unrest in Bushire I did not wish the troops to remain away longer than was necessary, nor did I intend that they should become entangled in operations on the mainland in view of the orders of Government. The enemy was pretty severely handled, their losses being estimated at about one hundred. 4. I would specially bring to notice the terms in which Major C, E, H. Wintle is mentioned by the Senior Naval Officer in his report to the Admiralty^ and also the gallant behaviour of Captain S. E. Apthorp, 96th Berar Infantry. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, J. E. NIXON, General^ Commanding Indian Expeditionary Force 'D:* c2898gsbDated Dushire, the 18th August 1915- From—M ajor C. E. H. WlNTLE, 96th Berar Infantry, Commanding Dilwar Field Force, To—The Officer Commanding Troops, Bushire. I have the honour to forward the following report and papers and map con nected with the operations at Dilwar between the 10th August 1915 and the 16th August 19I5. 2. On the 8th August 1915,! received orders from you to embark on H. M. S.' Lawrence ' and H. M. S. ' Dalhousie ' with four Companies, 96th Berar Infantry, and two machine guns, 96th Berar Infantry, and proceed to Dilwar. (Order* No. 1 attached.) •Appendix A. o I embarked all troops on the evening of the 9th August 1915* (Opera tion Orderf No. 1 attached.) fAppendix 1. 4. On the morning of 9th August 19155 ^ S- ' Lawrence and H. M. S. 'Dalhousie', escorted by H. M. S. ' Juno ' and H. M. S. ' I yramus, arrived off Dilwar. The troops were not. owing to various naval difficulties, (copy of Senior Naval Officer H. M. S. ' Juno ^Appendix 2- reportj attached) able to land until the morning of the 13th Aueust 19T5, but the time was not wasted as I was able during this wait to carry out close in shore reconnaissances and locate the flanks of the enemy's sea front position with acc- § Appendix 3, uracy. (See Dilwar Operation Order^ No. 2 attached). 6. I was informed early in the morning of the 13th August 191 5 that the Senior Naval Officer intended to commence landing operations, and the covering party assembled in the boats and left at II A.M. H. M. ships commen ced a bombardment to cover our landing. This covering fire was extremely well done. (See Operation Orderjl No. 3). II Appendix 4. 7. It will be seen in Operation Order No. 3 that I intended to land near Square L-l, (see Map attached), and wheel south down the coast and attack the north flank of enemy's position which rested on a small mound (Square N-y), but, owing to the strength of the tide and the small towing ^ power^of the steamboats, landing had to be effected right on the enemy's position (bquare n -d)- 1 he enemy put up a strong resistance at close range which resulted in a considerable number of casualties in the boats. However, assisted by the ships' guns and the naval machine guns mounted on the boats, a landing was made good, i he enemy then retreated some 2,000 yards inland. At this stage our troops captured a standard which had been erected by the enemy at a point near Square O-io. 8 Owing to the uncertainty of the time of the arrival of the rest of the troops* and stores, I decided not to go further that day, but to establish my Base at Square N-7, and strengthen it for night and day defence. I also established a piquet at Square N -9, and sent out reconnoitring patrols. (See Operation . ^ Orderl No. 4.) \Appendix 5. All troops and stores were landed by 6 P.M. this day. o My reconnoitring patrols reported that the enemy were established in force with their centre in Old Dilwar village and in palm grove at Squares K-12 and 1 ^ and that they also had piquets in entrenchments in a semi-circle around me at about 2,000 yards distance and to north and south of me on the beach. 10. The country being flat and bare of all cover, and strongly held by the enemy, I decided it was not advisable to attack by day but trust entirely to c2898gs32 reaching my future objective under cover of darkness for an attack at dawn. n. I was not definitely aware as to how New Dilwar and fort lay in regard to Old Dilwar, so I decided to make my first objective the palm grove at Square N.-12, from which place I hoped to be able to definitely locate New 3 . , Dilwar. (See Operation Order* No. O •Appendix 6. \ r o / 13. The attacking column started at 3-30 A.M., on the 14th August 1915, and we reached our objective by compass bearing without firing a shot. I ordered the east face of the palm grove to be occupied and entrenched, and it was then found that we had completely surprised the enemy who had evidently run away at our sudden approach, leaving a line of shelters on the east face of the grove, which would hold about 150 to 200 men, with all their goods and chattels lying about. 13. As soon as day broke I was able to place New Dilwar and fort (a massive structure with walls 30 feet high, with one large tower over the gateway) about 1,200 yards to my north-east (Square 1-9), but as the approach to the fort was across a bare open plain and it was strongly held by the enemy, who by this time had opened a hot fire on us from both the villages of Dilwar and fort and from the east and south of us, I decided to stay where I was and commence palm tree cutting operations (which was also part of my orders). 14. Tree cutting operations were commenced by one company (all I could spare from the defence of the grove) as soon as it was daylight and it was found that 65 men could cut down 65 trees in two hours, the number we actually cut down being 72. There were about 750 trees in the grove and as there were five or six more groves like it at about 2,000 yards apart—some smaller and some larger—I concluded that for tree cutting alone I should require at least a week, the trees being much larger and tougher than those at Bushire. Consequently, having opened up communication with the Senior Naval Officer through mv Base, I reported this to him for communication to Officer Commanding Troops, Bushire, and requested further orders in regard to this tree cutting as I had been told our services were even then urgently required in Bushire. 15. The tree cutting was being carried on excellently; our piquets and two machine guns were keeping the enemy off at a reasonable distance. 16. At this stage the enemy having been reinforced in Old Dilwar village (Square J-9) I sent a request to the Senior Naval Staff Officer to bombard that t Appendix 7. P lace - (Copyf of message attached ) It was at this stage that Commander Bloom- field, R.N., and Subadar Dharam Singh, 96th Berar Infantry, were shot. 17. By some error the ships' guns opened fire with lyddite on to the grove we were working in instead of on to Old Dilwar village, the shells dropping some yards short of the grove, knocking out an Indian officer and some of the men with the fumes. ^ The troops behaved splendidly under trying conditions, but I did not think, in view of the fact that 1 did not know how long the ships would continue this mistaken bombardment, that it would be right for me to continue tree cutting operations and expose my men to not only hot fire from the enemy but also from our own lyddite shells. I ordered a retirement and with my reserves took up a covering position some 600 yards nearer my Base camp; it was at this 5tage that Captain Carpenter; Royal Marine Light Infantry, went down with heat stroke and had to be carried into camp. 18. The enemy very quickly spotted my action and came on in spite of heavy loss with great determination, and it was during the preliminary stages of this retirement that most of my casualties and certain brave deeds which I brine to notice at the end of this report occurred. 19. The troops reformed quickly in rear of the position I had taken up and from then on to our Base camp we held the enemy back and effected a good retirement. &amp;3 so. The rest of the day was occupied in reconnaissance work and directing the fire of the ships' guns on the villages as we had now located them. 21. This fire was very effective, especially at Old Dilwar, which the enemy were seen to evacuate hurriedly, and, as it proved afterwards, permanently. 22. Having now obtained all the information I required. I decided to attack New Dilwar fort and village at dawn the follovving morning and destroy them. •Appendix 8. ' . (See Operation Order* No 6.) 23. My attacking column started at 3-30 A M. on the 15th August 1915, and marched by compass bearing on the south corner of Old Dilwar village, and on arrival there unopposed I dropped one company, 96th Berar Infantry, and one machine gun under Captain S. E. Apthorp, 96th Infantry, to take up a position to cover the approaches from the south and south east. 24 It turned out at a later stage that the enemy, anticipating that I would again attack the palm grove at Square K-12 and continue tree cutting opera tions, had occupied this palm grove in great strength with a view to surprising me if I repeated the operation of the previous day, but finding that I had occupied Dilwar Fort instead, they streamed across the open plain to attack me in large numbers and came under a heavy machine gun and rifle fire and lost heavily. 25. Having dropped Captain Apthorp's partv, I continued my advince, halting where I could just see the fort through the darkness. 1 then gave orders that as soon as it was possible to see, the volunteers of the demolition party should go forward and make a breach in the wall of the fort by which the storm ing party could effect an entrance. Soon after I had given these orders and was waiting for light enough to advance, a man of the demolition party accidently discharged his revolver; (this man was shot badly in the leg afterwards so I took no further action in the matter). Further secrecy being futile, I ordered the attack at once and a breach having been blown in the fort wall, it was rushed and occupied without any resistance. 26. I withdrew the storming party from the fort and placed them in position in the village buildings to guard the east and north approaches and proceeded with the demolition of the fort and the burning of the village, and this was continued until all demolition material had been expended. 27. As soon as the first explosion occurred the enemy opened a hot fire from the south and south-east and gradually developed their attack by reinforc ing till they were attacking us from the south, east and north. 28. It was noticed that the enemy utilised a large number of trotting camels to convey their reinforcements from one flank to another. It was also noticed that they were using some sort of pom-pom with a round explosive shell of about \' in diameter; and also that their numbers had very largely increased and that whereas on the day of landing there were only some 150 to 200 opposed to us, on the second day they were some : oo to 400 strong and on this last day they were some 500 to 600 strong, pointing to the fact that it was not only Dilwar opposing us but the whole surrounding country. 29. As soon as the destruction of Dilwar village and fort was finished, my task being completed, I ordered a retirement to camp z'/i north end of Old Dilwar, covered by the force I had placed under Captain Apthorp, 96th Imantry, at that place. This was very ably carried out and we returned to camp with a loss of only six wounded for the day's work. 30. On mv return to my Base I repeated my request as to orders for future action in regard to the cutting down of trees, intending, if allowed, to attack the enemy's stronghold at Square H.-21 the following morning, but I was informed that further operations would cease as our services were required in Bushire and it being considered that the enemy had been sufficiently punished. tAppendix 9. ( See Operation Orderf ho. 7.) 31. In regard to the manner in which the enemy have been punished, not only were they severely handled by the ships' guns but repeatedly came under4 heavy concentrated rifle and machine gun fire in all three land actions and their losses in killed and wounded must have been very heavy—in addition to which their fort and village are in ruins. 32. We re-embarked on to H. M. S. ' Dalhousie' and Lawrence on the night of the 15-16th August 1915, under cover of darkness, the stores being moved gradually by day—the main body under Captain Apthorp, 96th Infantry, at 9-30 P. M. and the covering force under the Officer Command- ine Force at 3-30 a m. without any action being taken bv the enemy ^ to impede our evacuation. (See Operation Order •Appendix 10. g ^ 33. On the 16th, after embarkation, the Senior Naval Officer informed me that it was his intention before returning to Bushire to send a boat expedition up the Hala Kor or Khor Koweir channel .and burn the enemy's dhows. I accompanied this expedition and obtained much useful military information in regard to Chah Tal and Jamsheri villages and the approaches from the south to Guruk. These three places have been used for months past by the enemy for purposes of con centration, and little was known about them. 34. Before closing I wish to draw attention to the able manner in which our naval escort assisted us in every way. 35. All men, both soldiers and sailors—both British and Indian—behaved well and were always cheerful and keen in spite of the fact that there were it cases of heatstroke during these actions in addition to the ordinary casualties, throwing great strain on my small medical establishment, especially during the retirements under heavy fire. 36. I attach a statement! of casualties that have occurred in connection with these operations. tAppendix II. 37.

Sir, &gt; I have the honour to forward the attached report of proceedings relative to operations at Dllwar between 10th August an ^ '6th August 2. I arrived at Bushire on Thursday 5th August at 4 AM., but was unable to take any steps till 10th August, as my officers and men were suffering severely from the heat and required rest and treatment. 3. On Mondy, 9th August, I sent the Lieutenant-Commander (N T ) round to Dilwar to lay down a mark-buoy for H. M. S. ' Juno ' to anchor on, as the survey off that part of the coast is very unreliable. A rough survey had been made by Commander Sutor of H. M. S. ' Lawrence' and this proved of great assistance. It was originally intended to leave Bushire at 11 -0 P. M. on the 9th August, and anchor off Dilwar that night, and carry out the attack early next morning, and 280 troops and 2 machine-guns under Major Wintle of the 96th Berar Infantry were embarked in H. M. Ships ' Lawrence' and ' Dalhousie ' for this purpose that evening. 4. Various difficulties, however, presented themselves after this plan was made. The principal one was the fact that the light is very bad till about 10 A. M. which would prevent the ships guns covering the landing before that hour. Secondly it was found that the soundingrs on the rough survey were not reliable enough and it was necessary to take time so as to move the ships in to the nearest distance from Dilwar compatible with safety. H. M. S. ' Juno ' anchored in 24 feet, H.M.S. ' Pyramus ' in 18 feet, H. M. S. &lt;f Dalhousie ' 16 feet and H.M.S. 'Lawrence' in 12 feet. Thirdly, the question of wind had U) be considered, as, with a shamal blowing, the boats cannot land troops. (The shore is very shelving ) 5. The squadron, consisting of H. M. Ships ' Juno ' (S. N. O.), ' Pyra mus ', ' Lawrence' and 14 Dalhousie ', left Bushire at 4-0 a. M. on Tuesday, 10th August, and anchored off Dilwar the same morning. Anchorage billets were fixed and ships took up positions as • Not submitted with this copy of the :eport. ^ attached chart * On nth August and 12th August, nothing could be done owing to a shamal blowing but, a lull having taken place, on 12th August, the covering party was got into the boats and this practice was very useful. The time, however, was not wasted as many points developed which enabled the scheme of landing to be amended and two reconnaissances to be made in Residency Launch and H. M. S. ' Lawrence 7. On 13th August the weather was favourable and landing operations com menced at 9-30 a. m. The covering party assembled at H.M.S.' Lawrence ' and left at 11 -0 a. m. and at the same time H. M. Ships ' Juno ' Pyramus ' and ' Lawrence ' opened controlled fire with salvoes. The part of the beach marked * * had been found to be strongly guarded with sangars and so it was arranged to land to the northward at * * and boats left in three lines for this purpose under the general command of the Captain of H. M. S. ' Pyramus The tide was running to the southward, and the towing power of steam-boats was small, consequently he decided to run straight for the beach and the boats landed somewhat further to the southward than was intended. (Y). This brought them partly under a very heavy fire from the enemy for a short time and it was then that all the landing casualties occurred. The men behaved excellently and the boats were smartly unloaded as they touched bottom some 100 yards from the beach and the covering party got ashore without further loss. 8. All boats that could do so, four in number, had maxims mounted in the bows and these assisted to keep down the enemy's fire very materially, but the deciding factor was undoubtedly the manner in which H.M.S. 'Juno's ' salvoes were worked along the beach in a systematic manner with a lateral spread for the6-inch guns of about 400 yards and reflects great credit on Lieutenant (G) and his guns' crews. H. M. S. ' Juno ' was lying 9,000 yards off and her fire was directed by me from H. M. S. ' Lawrence ' (.^,500 yards from the shore) where I had hoisted my Senior Officer's pennant. My only signals were 'Right', ' Left ' Over u Short '* Hit ' and Lieutenant Robertson had to work his bracket and fall of shot from that. All the landing party were loud in their praise of the efficient protection rendered by these guns, and from H. M. S. ' Lawrence' the enemy could be seen streaming from his sangars as the salvoes approached. H. M. S. *' Pyramus ' fire was well directed and of much assistance ; H. M. S. ' Lawrence's ' two 4 -inch guns were worked indepen dently of the other two ships, and were directed as seemed necessary at any point not covered by the other two ships. Her principal target was a sandhill and rock where numbers of the enemy were taking cover and directing their fire on the advancing boats. 9. For reasons of light, as before stated, the covering party did not leave H.M.S. ' Lawrence ' till 11 -0 A. M., when all boats advanced in three tows, the guns of H. M. Ships ' Juno ' and ' Pyramus ' opening fire at the same time in salvoes of filled common at 10,700 to 8,700 yards, H.M.S. ** Pyramus' at 7,600 to 7,200 yards. As soon as the range was picked up fire was concentrated on the landing beach till boats were close to it and then salvoes were worked along the beach to the south of the landing place, and, as stated before, were very efficient as a screen. The effect was very noticeable as the shot approached position 'Z', and the enemy was seen to be evacuating his sangars in great haste. 10. As soon as the men started to jump ashore the enemy practically cleared out, leaving his flag near () on the beach—this was taken by Major Wintle. The covering party took up a position and sent out scouts and, later on, established their base at ' Z ' and entrenched. The main body and stores were landed without any trouble and the rest of the day was spent in consoli dating the position chosen for the base. 11. On 14th August the troops advanced at 3-30 AM. and captured the palm grove south of Dilwar, expecting to find the village immediately to the east and close to. Owing to scanty knowledge of the locality this was found not to be the case, and the village was discovered to be 1,400 yards to the north-eastward with a flat plain, intersected by folds in the ground. Piquets were thrown out and tree-cutting commenced. 12. The enemy started a heavy fire and a signal was made to H. M. S. Juno ' to place a salvo on Dilwar village and wait for spotting corrections. The range was taken off the squared map and unfortunately the first and only salvo, three rounds of lyddite, fell in the palm grove occupied by the troops, and short. This necessitated a hurried retirement of the troops and it was here that most of the casualties occurred. However, no one was hit by gun fire from H. M. S. ' Juno and, as stated above, no further salvo was fired. This salvo also had the* effect of making the enemy pause in his advance and gave more time for our troops' retirement. All wounded, maxim- guns, stores, etc., were brought back, but two dead sepoys, had to be left for lack of stretchers. 13. As the enemy was attacking in great force, the cutting down of palms was abandoned and troops returned to camp, the men being, by that time, much exhausted by the heat. It was during this attack that Commander Bloomfield was killed. He was shot through the body and died i| hours later. This officer was in charge of the demolition party but was in the act of conferring with Major Wintle with a view to supporting the fire on the right flank where the enemy was pressing. Captain Carpenter, R. M .L.I., went down with heat -stroke at about the same time. 14. H. M. S. ' Juno fired salvoes of indirect fire during the forenoon (the officers ashore spotting) at ranges from n 500 to 11,000 yards. Again in the afternoon H. M. S. Junos fire was directed on Dilwar Fort, which was struck at a range of 11,600 yards. 15. After getting the report from the Officer Commanding Troops, I decided to go down and confer with the Consul-General at Bushire, as I had been receiv ing several telegrams from Army Commander, Basrah, and Consul-General,11 Bushire, emphasizing the desirability of getting the troops back to Bjshire a? soon as possible owing to the unrest in that place. 1 accordingly went down in H. M S. ' Dalhoasie' leaving the Captain of H. M. S &lt;( Pyramns ' in temporary charge I returned early on 15th August and found the troops had made another early morning attack and had captured and burnt Dilwar village and had blown up the fort and then withdrawn to the camp under cover of gun fire from H. M. S. ' Juno 16. The Consul General and I had decided that a sufficient lesson would have been given to Rais ' Ali, chief of Dilwar, if his village was destroyed, and in view of the number of palm trees, (some thousands), and the time it would take to cut them down being estimated to take at least a week, alsi the fact that H. M. S, (&lt; Juno ' has only 1 10 Japanese rifles and i6,s o 5 rounds of •256 ammunition and that a large part of this had been expended ; it was not desirable to retain troops so long at Dilwar, as the villages of Madoomari and Bashi had joined in with Dilwar. 17. I bombarded both these places with H. M. S. ' Juno's'' and H. M.S. ' Pyramus ' guns ; apparently all the inhabitants of the three villages had fled to the mountains, as no signs could be seen of them, O.ving to the participation of these villages, the resistance to our troops was very much greater than had been anticipated ; also they appeared to be extremely well led. Accordingly I decided to withdraw the Punitive Force and did so undercover of darkness on night of 15th-16th August without any casualties. 18. I attach* reports from Major Wintle of the Q^th Berar Infantry, in • Not submitted with this copy of Senior Naval command of the force asllOiC, alsD a Officer's report. of the anchorage and map showing pnncip u features and squared map, also composition of force and orders issued lor landing, also list of casualties sustained. 19. I have nothing but praise for the way everyone performed their duties under most trying heat conditions, and, in addition to those mentioned by Major Wintle as having come directly under his notice, I beg to bring to your notice the names of Captain George Carpenter, R. M. L. 1., and of Lieutenant Gerard W. T. Robertson, Royal Navy, both of H. M. S. ' Juno '. 1 hese two olhcers did all the staff work of preparation and were invaluable to me. As regards Lieutenant Robertson, I had of necessity to be in H. M. S. ' Lawrence ' and consequently to leave him to run the gunnery work entirely on his own, acting on instructions given by me the day before. For a /oung officer it was no light task to direct the fire o! salvoes cf 6-inch guns at that distance and to keep them as close as possible to the advancing troops without endangering them. Ihis, as I have previously stated, he did most ably and intelligently and I do not consider that the incident of the one salvo dropping near the troops was his fault in any possible way, as the topographical information at our disposal was so inaccurate, and he promptly ceased tire witnout orders when he found his shots had fallen so close. 20. Lieutenant Edward A. Singeisen, R. N. R., was in charge of the Residency Launch taking one tow. This boat is manned by a native crew, and they all bolted below when firing commenced, nearly causing a catastrophe to the boats. Lieutenant Singeisen behaved with great promptitude and handled the boat himself until laid out by a bullet through his lungs, when Petty Officer Ernest Davey, Chatham, 178062, took his place. 21. Commander Viscount Kelburn took charge of all embarking and disembarking operatiors and his assistance was invaluable. I should like to add how much I appreciate the manner in which Major Wintle worked with me and mv officers and met us in every possible way. This officer had a bullet through his helmet and three bullet grazes on his legs and arms. 22. On leaving Dilwar with the squadron, I despatched steam-cutter and gig in charge of a Lieutenant to search Khor Koweir and destroy any '1 angistani dhows. One dhow only was found, and this was burnt. Major Wintle, 96th Berar Infantry, went with these boats and made a reconnaissance of the creek and its approaches and located Chah Tal, which had been one of «12 the headquarters of the German Agent Wassmuss, and also located the village of Jam Sheri which has been utilised by the Tangistanis as a base for their operations. This should prove most useful should it be desired to take further action against this tribe in the future. I l ave the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) D. St. A.
