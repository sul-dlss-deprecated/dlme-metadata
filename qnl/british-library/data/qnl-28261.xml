Previous Papers: — This Who’s Who comes very opportunely, for we have been rather at a loss of late for information as to some of the leading personalities on the Persian stage. At the moment the scene is dominated by the Shah (No. 1) and Taimourtache (No. 2), and so long as the ascendancy of the latter continues, no other Persian politician is likely to be of more than secondary importance. But the following in the list now submitted are of some interest:- No. 7. The titular Prime Minister. No. 8. Prince Firuz, Minister of Finance. No. 12. Daver, Minister of Justice. No. 23. The Persian Minister in London. 2877 1000 6.28 No. 26./No. 26. The Persian representative at the League. No. 27. The late Persian Foreign Minister. No. 29. The editor of the 'Shafaq-Surkh'. No. 34. General Shaibani, late Chief of the General Staff, who was a source of great trouble to us in connection with the air route along the Persian shore of the Gulf.• k o 1. Reza Shah Pahlavi. 1926. Born about 1873. Comes of a small family from Sawad Kuh, in Mazanderan. His father was a Persian and his mother of Caucasian stock, whose parents sought refuge in Persia when certain Caucasian districts were ceded to Russia by the Treaty of Turkomanchai. He entered the Persian Cossack Brigade at the ag 15 and was employed as a stable boy. He rose from the ranks and gamed approval of the Russian instructors of the brigade for his courage and fearlessness, and whenever an expedition was sent to different parts of Persia to chase brigands or quell disturbances, he seems to have taken part therein. By the beginning of the war he had become a colonel, and in 1921, when the Cossock Brigade, previously transformed into a division, was deprived of its Russian officers and was being reformed after having been severely handled by the Bolshevik forces in North Persia, was in need of a resolute leader, the choice fell on Reza Khan. In March 1921 he marched at its head towards the capital, which he took with the greatest ease, installing Seyid Zia-ed-Hin as Premier, himself keeping the command of the army. From that time on he had a rapid rise to power. Six weeks later he became Minister for War, an office which he held until the 31st October, 1925, becoming, in addition thereto, Prime Minister from October 1923 onwards. On the 31st October, 1925, the Majlis deposed Sultan Ahmed Shah and entrusted the provisional direction of the country to Reza Khan Pahlavi. On the 16th December, 1925, in consequence of the decision of the Constituent Assembly, Reza Khan succeeded to the throne of Persia with the title of Reza Shah Pahlavi. He was crowned in April 1926. He is entirely self-educated, but has a natural dignity. He is of strong ctiaracter and has a great deal of ability and energy. Full of ambition, he has set out to extricate Persia from disintegration and from the morass of inefficiency in which she had fallen and raise her to a position of real independence. In spite of tremendous difficulties, he has succeeded already to a large extent, but it is rather entirely and at the same time train others to carry on the work. He is not popular, but feared, which perhaps in an oriental country is the greater advantage of the two. The medal has a reverse side. He is insincere in the sense that he regards prevarication and duplicity as fair weapons, thoroughly suspicious of anybody whom he suspects to be cleverer than himself; he therefore prefers to surround himself with mediocrities for the most part. He is avaricious, and all means by which he can acquire this world’s goods are good to him. Since he has become Shah he has lost some of his physical energy and indulges more in opium and arak, or it may be that these have more effect on him in his sedentary life as a monarch than they had when he was living a life in the open; he has certainly grown stouter and has become more bloated, but his old energy sometimes returns, and then he goes on a journey of some weeks to a far distant part of his country, returning the better for his holiday. Whilst he is feared himself by reason of his rough tongue and sometimes rougher methods of treatment which he personally metes out to his subordinates and sometimes to others of his subjects, he himself is not without fear, and it is said that he never goes to bed without having within reach several weapons, and that he frequently starts up from his sleep to grasp one of them. He is pitiless towards all whom he suspects of having plotted against him, and even where little or no proof of their culpability is forthcoming they are condemned to a lifelong prison. Finally, it may be said that his great skill in dealing with his own compatriots has its counterpart in a sublime ignorance of foreign mentality. Beyond once returning from Khuzistan to Tehran via Bagdad, he has never been out of Persia. 2. Mirza Abdul Hussein Khan Taimmirtache (Serdar Moazzam Khorassani). Born about 1888 of a Khorassan family, he was educated in Russia. Was elected a Deputy to the third, fourth, fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis, although he did not take his seat in the sixth term, as he was appointed Minister of Court to Reza Shah Pahlavi before the sixth Parliament was opened. Was Persian member of the mixed financial commission, 1916-17. Appointed Governor of Gilan in 1919, and remained there one year during the first Persian Cossack expedition against the Jungalis. Minister of Justice, January to June 1922. Governor of Kerman, in the nature of a one-man show. Given a sufficient lease of life, he may succeed 1926.[18830] b 2 September 1923 to April 1924. Minister of Public Works, August 1924—August 1925, and August to the 16th December. After the accession to the throne of Reza Shah Pahlavi on the 16th December, Taimourtache took over the duties of Minister of the Court. In the summer of 1926 went to Moscow on behalf of the Shah a.nd Persian Government to try and arrange the terms of a commercial and trading agreement with the Soviet, but was not successful. Visited Germany, Switzerland . .d France before returning to Persia in December 1926. Speaks French and Russian very well and understands English. In the Majlis he showed himself a good orator, and as a Minister was generally chosen to answer for the Government in Parliament. Clever and energetic, he has pleasant manners and socially is agreeable. He is of a light-hearted disposition, witty, and often flippant, but a sense of responsibility newly acquired would appear to have added a semblance of gravity to a character which until quite recently was fickle and changeable. He is at the same time a confirmed gambler. As Minister of the Court he has acquired the position of the Shah s most intimate political adviser. His influence is ubiquitous and his power exceeds that of the Prime Minister. He attends all meetings of the Council of Ministers, and one might compare his position with that of Reicn’s Chancellor, except that he has no direct responsibility. He is an ardent Nationalist, and is mainly responsible for the recent denunciation of treaties with a view to ending the regime of consular jurisdiction. So long as he holds his position as Minister of the Court he will remain the most powerful man in the country after Reza Shah. 1927. Taimourtache has, on the whole, strengthened his position, and the Shah appears to rely on him even more than before. 1928. Visited Europe in the summer of 1928 and was received by His Majesty King George V in London; also visited Paris, Berlin, Rome and Brussels, where he was entertained by each Government. Returned to Persia at end of September. Granted by the Shah title of “Highness” (Jenab Ashraf) on his return in September as a mark of Royal appreciation of his services. Has maintained, and even increased, his influence and prestige during 1928. 3. Mirza Hassan Khan Mostaufi. 1926. Formerly known as Mostaufi-el-Mamalek. Age about 57. The son of a former Prime Minister and Minister of Finance who died in 1882, Mirza Hassan Khan inherited large estates and much wealth from his father. He was in Europe from 19 ()Q_() 7 ? during which time he squandered most of the riches he had inherited. When he returned to Persia in 1907 he was appointed Paymaster-General of the Army. He was elected to the Majlis in 1908, and became in 1909 first Minister of War and then Minister of Finance. In 1910 he was appointed Prime Minister, but resigned in 1911. In 1913 he was again Minister of War and in 1914 again Prime Minister. Resigning in March 1915, he was again called upon in August, and was Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior until December 1915. From June to December 1917 he was a Minister without portfolio, and from January to April 1918 he was again Prime Minister. In July 1920 he again appeared as Minister without portfolio in the Cabinet of Mirza Hassan Khan Pirnia (Mushir-ed-Dowleh), which lasted until November 1920. He held no further appointment until February 1923. when he again assumed the Premiership until June of the same year. After a lapse of more than three years he again became Prime Minister in June 1926, and held office until May 1927, when he resigned. He is a typical old-time Persian gentleman, fond of hawking and hunting, but a man of weak character and incapable of taking a decision on the most unimportant matter. Completely bereft of any qualities of organisation or administration, he has entirely whittled away the great wealth he inherited from his father. His complete lack of decision was particularly noticeable during his I’remiership in 1915, when he weakly allowed the pro-German party to act just as they liked, andfor which he acquired a reputation of unfriendliness towards Great Britain and her Allies. It may now be stated he was not unfriendly, but he was too weak and lacking in energy to take any action to stop the intrigues of the Central Bowers. His feeble character has not gained any strength by the experience of ^ears. and it he is still incapable of doing bad he is equally incapable of doing good. 1928. Elected as a Deputy for Tehran in the seventh term of the National Assembly (opened the 6th October, 1928), but declined to accept. 4. Mir'za Hassan Khan Pirnia, G.C.M.G. {Mushir-ed-Dowleh). 1926. Born about 1872, eldest son of the late Mushir-ed-Dowleh, who was Foreign Minister for many years and died in 1907. Educated in Russia and speaks Irench and Russian fluently. Appointed Persian Minister to the Russian Court in 1902. In 1906 he joined the Constitutional party, and was one of the Progressives who were instrumental in obtaining Muzaffer-ed-Din Shah’s signature to the Consti tution. He translated from French and Russian many laws on which the Persian Constitution was originally based. In 1907 he went to London as special envoy to announce the accession to the Persian Throne of Mohammad Ali Shah, and was created a G.C.M.G. Became Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs for a few months at the end of 1907 and again at the beginning of 1908. Minister of Justice from July 1908 to January 1909. Has at various times been also Minister of War. Became Prime Minister in March 1915 for a month, in 1920 for four months, in 1922 for six months and in 1923 for five months. He and his brother, Hussein Khan Pirnia, have generally been the two most favoured candidates for the Majlis from Tehran. Mirza Hassan Khan Pirnia is a very intelligent man with a good reputation for honesty among his compatriots, but he is very timorous, and has always preferred to resign liis portfolio than face a crisis. Inherited large properties from his father and is very wealthy. 1928. Elected a Deputy for Tehran in the seventh term of the Majlis (opened the 6th October), but refused to accept. 5. Mirza Hassan Khan Vossuq, G.C.B. (Vossuu-ed-Dowleh). 1926. &gt; Age about 58. Started his career in the Ministry of Finance. Was a Deputy in the first and second Parliaments, and in 1909 was elected a member of the Nationalist Committee which directed the affairs of State on the dethronement of Mohammad Ali Shah. His first Cabinet appointment was as Minister of Justice in October 1909. In the following month he became Minister of Finance, but resigned in July 1910. In July 1911 he became Minister of Interior, but after a few days he took over the portfolio of Foreign Affairs. Was again Minister for Foreign Affairs in January 1913, but left for Europe in June of that year.

Appointed Minister of Finance in June 1926, but resigned in November to take his seat in Parliament. Speaks French, and is a man of great ability and character. Became unpopular over the Anglo-Persian Convention, but regained a large measure of popularity after his return in 1926, especially after a most able and convincing defence in Parliament of his actions as Premier during the period August 1918 to June 1920, Has still some bitter enemies, who do not cease to attack him on all possible occasions and who try to prevent him from acquiring the favour of His Majesty the Shah. The mutual antipathy between His Majesty and Vossuq renders the latter's return to power unlikely.1928. Vossuq's popularity would appear to have increased,and the suspicions formerly harboured by the Shah seem to have diminished. Vossuq was elected as one of the Tehran Deputies to the seventh term of the Majlis and took his seat. He would, however, prefer to occupy a post in Europe, and it is learned privately from a high y^hority that he has been offered the Persian Legation in Berlin. 6. Mirza Mohammad A Li Khan Feroughi (Zuka-ul-Mulk). 1926. Age about 53. Son of Mirza Hussain Khan, and Isfahani converted Israelite. Speaks French and English, and passes as a jurist.

Became Minister of War in Mustaufi’s Cabinet of June 1926 to May 1927. Went to Europe in June 1927. Honest, well read, and an interesting and intelligent conversationalist, but entirely lacking in character, energy and decision. 1927.

Became Minister of Justice in November 1917 and again in January 1918, subsequently becoming Minister of Interior in April 1918, when he abetted the Jangalis in their rebellion against the Central Government, and used his official position to carry on propaganda in the South Persia Rifles, which led to some disaffection. Became Minister of Finance, July to November 1920, and Minister of Public Works, March to June 1923. Deputy in fifth Majlis, 1924-26. Minister of Public Works, June 1926. Chief judge in High Court of Appeal, April 1927, and appointed Prime Minister in June 1927. Is intelligent and well read. His hatred of Russia caused him to favour the German cause in the Great War, and he became as a result very unfriendly towards Great Britain. Of later years he has been more friendly, endeavours to keep away from political intrigue and spends all his spare time in reading and writing.6 1927 Mehdi Quli Khan Hedayet was still Prime Minister at the end of ^ after the departure of Dr. Millspaugh, was in addition appoin e General of Finances. 8. Prince Firuz Mirza, G.C.M.G. (Nusrat-ed-Dowleh). 1926. Born about 1888. Eldest son of Prince Farman Farina, and great-great grandson of Fath Ali Shah.

Elected a Deputy, to the fourth, nltn and sixth terms of the Majlis. Made his peace with His Majesty's Legation in 192J, and was appointed Governor-General of Fars, 1923—24, where he was quite suc^essiu . Appointed Minister of Justice, August to December 1925, and Minister oi Finance in February 1927. , ^ . T £ . Speaks French extremely well and understands English. Is one oi the utost intelligent Persians of his age, and a very clever politician. Is not popular with his compatriots, who are jealous of his intelligence and resent his unscrupulousness. Received the contents of his own gun in the right arm whilst out hunting m 1922, and has been thereby deprived of the normal use of his right hand. He is, I fear, a very fickle friend of Great Britain, and 1 have as little confidence in his honesty as the majority of his countrymen have. Like 1 aimourtache, whose most intimate friend he is, he is a born gambler. He owes money in every direction including tailors’ bills in London, which he declines to pay, and for which he would be liable to prosecution should he at any time return to England. At the same time, his ability marks him out as one of the leading men m the country, whether in the Cabinet or in the Majlis, and the Shah, who probably does not trust him, recognises his usefulness. 1927. Firuz Mirza, thanks to the support received from his friend, Taimourtache, has been able to maintain his position as Minister of Finance and, perhaps, even to strengthen it, in spite of much opposition. 9. Mirza Ali Quli Khan Ansari (Mushaver-el-Mamalek). 1926. Age about 54. Was for many years a secretary in the Persian Legation in Petrograd, becoming Charge d’Affaires there in 1911. Returned to Persia in 1913 and was appointed Secretary-General in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, becoming Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in June 1913. He became Minister for Foreign Affairs in Farman Farma’s Cabinet, December 1915-February 1916. In 1917 he was appointed assistant to Governor-General in Khorassan. In January 1918 he was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in Mustaufi’s Cabinet and retained that portfolio in the following Cabinet formed by Najaf Quli Bakhtiari (Samsam-es- Sultaneh) in May 1918. The Cabinet was reconstructed after a month and a half, and Ansari was replaced only, however, to return as Minister for Foreign Affairs in Mirza Hassan Khan Vossuq’s Cabinet formed on the 7th August, 1918. At the end of that year Eersia sent a mission to Paris to attend the Peace Conference, and at Ahm^ Shah’s instigation Ansari was appointed as head of that mission. The mission was abortive and Ansari was appointed in 1.919 Persian Ambassador to Constantinople. In 1920 he was appointed to Moscow, and with Taqizadeh wasinstrumental in drawing up the Perso-Soviet Treaty of February 1921. Ansan remained as Ambassador in Moscow until July 1926, when he returned to Tehran to take up the appointment of Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. He returned to Moscow on a special mission in March 1927, and is still there. He talks Russian and French fluently and is quite a pleasant man socially. He i^Jairly intelligent but carries little weight and is not too truthful. He has a r^itation amongst his compatriots for demagogy, lack of character, and for making money out of appointments to posts in the service under his authority. As Minister for Foreign Affairs he is most unsatisfactory, and one need never hope to get anything settled through his good offices. 1927. Mirza Ali Quli Khan Ansari was able to bring the Russo-Persian negotiations over outstanding questions to a successful issue by the autumn, and has remained on in Moscow as Special Ambassador whilst still nominally Minister for Foreign Affairs in Tehran. 1928. Visited Warsaw, where he put the finishing touches to the Perso-Polish Commercial Treaty, Czechoslovakia and Berlin early in 1928. Again appointed Persian Ambassador in Moscow in May 1928. 10. Mirza Hussein Khan Pirnia (Mutamin-ul-Mulk). 1926. Born about 1875, the second son of Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Educated in France and speaks French and English fluently. On his return to Tehran in 1902 became secretary to his father, who was then Minister for Foreign Affairs. Received his first appointment in the Cabinet as Minister of Education in 1918. Minister without portfolio in 1920. He has generally preferred a parliamentary to a ministerial career, and he has been elected to every Parliament since the beginning of the Constitution. Was elected President for the whole term of the third and fourth Parliaments and for the greater part of the fifth, and again in February 1927 succeeded Tadayun as President of the sixth Parliament; is a very impartial and firm President. He is an intelligent man of firm character, but of a modest and retiring nature. Is studious and well read. 1928. Was elected as one of the Tehran Deputies to the seventh Majlis, but declined to accept. 11. Mirza Hassan Khan Mushar (Mushar-ul-Mulk). 1926. Born about 1874. Started his career in the Ministry of Finance and rose to be an accountant. Became Minister of Finance, 1916-17, and again in 1918 in Mirza Hassan Khan Vossuq’s Cabinet, exchanging that post later for the one of Minister without portfolio until June 1920. Appointed Minister of Court by Seyid Zia-ed- Din in 1921. Elected a Deputy to the fourth term of the Majlis, 1921, but was suspected of plotting against Reza Khan, then Minister of War, and was obliged to resign and go to Europe. He returned in 1924, his innocence having been mean while established. Became Minister for Foreign Affairs from August 1924 until December 1925, when he resigned. Speaks no foreign language. Is a man of great common sense and is intelligent. As Minister for Foreign Affairs was extremely friendly to His Majesty’s Legation and used his best endeavours to effect the settlement of outstanding questions. Is not popular with many of his compatriots in high places owing to his straightforward character and outspokenness. 12. Ali Akber Khan Barer. 1926. Born about 1887. A son of a subordinate official in the private treasury of Muzaffer-ed-Din Shah, he was educated in Tehran. He started his career as Chief of8 ? Cabinet to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in 1909, and subsequently transferred to the Ministry of Justice, where he rose to be a Public Prosecutor. In 1910 he accompanied some Persian children to Switzerland as their tutor and then stayed there to study law, finally taking his degree at Geneva, lie returned to Persia in 1921 and edited a newspaper. He was elected a Deputy to the fourth, fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis, and in addition exercised his profession as a lawyer. Elecja^J to the Constituent Assembly in December 1925, he was elected by the members A that assembly to revise the constitutional law in a way which would permit the accession of Reza Khan as Shah. He did so, and successfully defended the revision before the assembly in open session, for which he earned the Shah s gratitude. He was appointed Minister of Public Works, December 1925 to June 1926, when he took his seat in Parliament. Daver is a studious, intelligent and well-read man, a capable lawyer, and speaks French very well. He has founded a Radical party in Persia which has many adherents. Is generally regarded as a t: coming man ' by his compatriots, although he is not entirely free from those common sins so frequently found a mongs t Persian p olitician s—demagogy and untruthfulness. As Minister of Justice, to which post heTvaslippointed in February 1927, he displayed a feverish energy in sweeping away the old Adliyeh Courts and paving the way for the Shah's declaration in April that the Capitulations would be abolished. He is likely to remain Minister of Justice for the present, whatever Cabinets may come and go, so long as he retains the Shah's confidence. 13. Seyed Mohammad Tadayun. 1926. Born about 1884.

Was one of the principal protagonists of the Republican movement in 1924, and is said to have appropriated for himself a large part of the funds put at his disposal for the realisation of that object. As President of the Majlis he was quite a success, being impartial and strict in upholding the rules of the House. He is undoubtedly an intelligent man and has a very pleasant manner. Speaks no European language, although he is now learning French. 1927. Seyed Mohammad Tadayun resigned his portfolio on the 3rd December on finding that his opinions did not coincide with those of his colleagues in the Cabinet, but he resumed office nine days later at the request of the Shah. 1928. Resigned his portfolio as Minister of Public Instruction on the 7th January, it is said, at the order of His Majesty the Shah. He appears to have fallen into disfavour on account of the personal animosity towards him of Taimourtache, the Minister of Court. He tried to obtain election to the seventh term of the Majlis, but the Court vetoed his candidature. The set-back may, however, only be a temporary one, and at the end of 1928 there are signs that he may return to favour. 14. Mirza Seyid Mehdi Khan Fatemi (Imad-es-Sultaneh). 1926. Born about 1886. Has had an official career in the Ministry of Finance, and in 1918 rose to be representative of that Ministry in his native city of Isfahan, where he enjoyed a certain amount of influence through his own family and that of his wife, who was a daughter of Prince Zill-es-Sultan.

Started his career as a religious teacher, and dabbled in politics for years before he entered Parliament as a Member for Isfahan in 1914. He was a leading member of the Provisional Government set up by the Muhajerin, or pro-German exiles, at Kermanshah in 1915, and went to Constantinople, only returning to Persia early in 1918. look refuge in the mosque at Shah Abdul Azim as a protest against the Cabinet of Samsam-es-Sultaneh in the summer of 1918 and worked hard to bring in the Vossuq-ed-Dowleh Cabinet of that year. Quarrelled with Vossuq over the Anglo- Persian Convention, and gained much popularity thereby. Has been a prominent Deputy in each succeeding Parliament. Mudarris, more than any individual Persian, caused the failure of the republican movement in 1924. He leads a very simple life and is much revered by the lower classes, who frequent his house greatly. They find in him a ready friend, and he is always willing to help them in their troubles. He is quite fearless and frank and expresses his opinions openly and freely. Nobody escapes his criticisms, from His Majesty the Shah to the lowest in the land. This fearlessness nearly cost him his life in October 1926, when a serious attempt to assassinate him was made one day in the very early morning in a narrow street a few yards away from an extremely busy thoroughfare. He was badly wounded in three places, but recovered. He is extremely cute and, for a cleric of his upbringing, far-sighted, but at times a demagogue and very obstinate; an ardent patriot, but lacking in that cultured intelligence which alone can prevent his obstinacy from degenerating into narrow-mindedness. His greatest desire is to be the counsellor of Kings-and Cabinets 1928. Was not allowed to be elected as a Deputy for the seventh term of the Majlis. Exiled to Khorassan in October 1928. 19. Mirza Hassan Khan Isfandiari (Mohtesham-es-Sidtaneh). 1926. Aged 64. Entered the Foreign Office, and after a short time was appointed secretary to Persian Legation in Berlin.

Minister of Education, June 1922 to June 1923, and Minister of Finance, September 1926 to January 1927. Hostile to the Allied cause in the Great War, he was bought by the Germans in 1915, but that did not prevent him obtaining money from the Russians as well. An intriguer and dishonest. When Minister of Finance in 1917, he caused the grain in the Government depositories to be sold to pay up arrears of salaries due to Government servants, and by this act was partly responsible for the mortality caused1L in Tehran by the famine which followed the crop failure in 1917. Speaks a little French; has now partly lost his sight, and is unlikely to take any further active part in the political life of Persia. 20. Suleiman Mirza. ^26. Born about 1875. An obscure Qajar Prince, he was one of the leaders of the Democrat party in the early years of the Persian Constitution. Was a member of the third Majlis and left Tehran with the pro-German clique in 1915 for Bagdad and Constantinople. On the capture of Bagdad by the British forces, he took refuge with the Sinjabi tribe on the Perso-Traq frontier, and from that haven of refuge he conducted a system of espionage against the British army. On the Sinjabis refusing to surrender him, they were attacked in 1918, and Suleiman Mirza was captured and sent to India. He returned in 1921 and was again elected to the Majlis, where he led the very small Socialist group. Was again elected to the fifth term of the Majlis and was leader of the Minority. Since the establishment of a Soviet Legation in Persia he has been on very intimate terms with the Bolshevik representatives. Was made Minister of Education in 1923, but did nothing except fill posts of that Ministry wdth Socialist friends. Was not elected to the sixth Majlis in 1926, as by that time he had lost any popularity he ever had. Speaks no foreign languages, fs a demagogue and time-serving politician. His Socialist party has broken down rather badly and may be said to be almost non-existent. 1927. Was invited to attend the tenth year celebration of the Bolshevik regime at Moscow in October, and thence visited Berlin and Paris, where he renewed acquaintance with old Socialist friends. 21. Mirza Ahmad Khan (Qawam-es-Sultaneh). 1926. A brother of Mirza Hassan Khan Vossuq, and like him passed the earlier years of his career in the Ministry of Finance.

Banished to Europe in October 1923, being accused of having plotted against the life of Reza Khan, now Reza Shah. Has never returned to Persia. A clever man, but sly, intriguing and unreliable. Has been generally friendly to His Majesty’s Legation during his political career. 22. Mirza Daoud Khan Miftah, K.C.M.G. (Miftah-es-Sultaneh). 1926. Born about 1870. Started his career in Persian Foreign Office. Accompanied the late Ala-es-Suitaneh on special mission to London in 1905, was received by King and created a K.C.M.G.

Appointed Persian consul-general in India in 1911 and remained there until 1920, when he was appointed Persian Minister in London, which post he occupied until 1925. Returned to Tehran early in 1925 and was appointed Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Appointed Persian Minister at Washington in 1926. Speaks English and French fluently, and has much charm of manner. After vears of service abroad, he was unable to accustom himself to life in his own country and prefers to occupy a post in a foreign country. [18830] c 223. Hovannes Khan Massehian. 1926. Born about 1864 and entered the service of the Persian Foreign Office whilst very young. Is a Persian Armenian. Was attached to the Persian mission which attended both Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria. Was confidential secretary to Nasr-ul-Mulk when Prime Minister and Regent during the minority of Ahmj^ Shah. Sent in 1910 to Berlin as Charge d’Affaires, subsequently being appointeu Minister there. In 1916 he was recalled at instance of German Government, who accused him of pro-British sentiments. He left for Paris and London, staying mostly in the latter place until the end of 1925, when he returned to Persia. In 1926 was elected as Armenian representative to the Majlis. Hovannes Khan is a well-read man and somewhat of a litteraire. He has translated many of Shakespeare’s works into Armenian and has a great desire to complete that work. Has been and still is the protege, friend and confidant of Nasr-ul-Mulk, wffiose political views he shares. Talks English and French fluently. In consequence of his long absence from Persia and consequent loss of touch with the more modern political circles there, his political influence is not great, but he is highly respected. 1927. Was appointed Persian Minister to the Court of St. James in July, and left to take over his duties there in August. 24. Mirza Mahmud Khan Alamir (Ihtisham-es-Sultaneh). 1926. Born about 1865. A member of the Qajar tribe, brother of the late Ala-ed- Dowleh. Member of the Special Embassy to Russia for Czar's coronation in 1895. Consul-General in Bagdad 1895-97. Director-General and Under-Secretary in the Foreign Office 1897. Persian Minister in Germany 1901-06.

Returned to Persia in 1922. Appointed Minister of Interior September 1926. Speaks German and French and understands English. Has a certain amount of determination, but is very irritable and easily angered and then loses control of himself. Is quite useless as a Cabinet Minister, having entirely lost touch with his country after so many years of residence abroad. 25. Seyid Hassan Taqizadeh. 1926. Born in Tabriz about 1880, the son of a small preacher in the mosque. Educated in Tabriz, he used to haunt the booksellers shops in that town, where he show r ed great eagerness to obtain knowdedge. In his early youth he was an ardent Nationalist and was connected with the Nationalist movement in Persia from its inception. He founded the Azerbaijan Club in Tehran and was one of the most prominent members of the first Majlis. Mohammad Ali Shah hated and feared him particularly, and when the Shah made his coup d'Etat in June 1908 against the Majlis, Taqizadeh took refuge in His Majesty’s Legation. The Shah demanded that he should be given up, but the demand was refused and Taqizadeh finally received an amnesty on condition that he left Persia for a time. He went to London and Cambridge, but returned to Tabriz at the end of 1908. He w^as elected a member of the second Majlis in 1909. He was a member of the Nationalist Committee formed after the taking of Tehran in July 1909 by the Nationalist force and the abdication of Mohammad Ali Shah, to arrange the government of the country. He left Tehran for Europe in July 1910. He was elected to the third and fourth Majlisses,but did not take his seat. He travelled in Europe and America between 1914 and 1923, staying for years in Berlin, where he edited a newspaper called “Kaveh.” During this time the mujtehids excommunicated him for having printed certain articles which they alleged were in contravention of Islam. He negotiated the Perso-Soviet Commercial Treaty in Moscow in February 1921, and returned finally to Persia in13 1924. He was elected to the fifth term of the Majlis, 1924^26, and to the sixth term in 1926. He went to America in 1926 as Persian representative at the Philadelphia Exhibition. Taqizadeh is a well-read man and widely travelled, but no longer enjoys the popularity which he once did in the early days of the Constitution. He no longer shows the zeal and energy which formerly gained him many adherents, and although a^limes his speeches in the Majlis mark him as a man of common sense and moderation, he seems unwilling to wish to play a role in the politics of the country. This desire to take a back seat is in sharp contrast to the enthusiasm and zeal of the fiery young orator of the first days of the Constitution and gives his countrymen the impression that he is played out. He has been mentioned as a possible Minister in more than one recent Cabinet, and it is said that definite offers were made to him. but if they were, they were never accepted, and he has been content to sit in the Majlis. 26. Mirza Hussein Khan Ala {Moin-el-Vezareh), 1926. Porn about 1884. Son of the late Prince Ala-es-Sultaneh, for many years Persian Minister in London. Educated at Westminster School and talks English and French most fluently. Created a C.M.G. in 1905, when he returned to London with his father bearing presents from Muzaffer-ed-Din Shah to the late King Edward VII. Appointed Chief of Cabinet in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1906, when his late father was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs. He remained as Chief of Cabinet to successive Foreign Ministers until 1915. Minister of Public Works in Mustaufi’s Cabinet, January 1918, and also in Samsam-es-Sultaneh's Cabinet, May to August 1918. This Cabinet abrogated the Treaty of Turkomanchai and announced its intention of abolishing exterritorial privileges. Mirza Hussein Khan was particularly hostile to Sir C. Marling, His Majesty’s Minister, and used his brother, then Persian Minister in London, to make complaints to the Foreign Office. He accompanied the abortive Persian Mission to the Peace Conference in 1918 at Paris, Appointed Persian Minister in Madrid in 1919 and Minister in Washington in 1920. Conducted negotiations in Washington in 1921-22 for the American Financial Mission to Persia, after his abortive attemps to obtain the Northern Persia oil concession first for the Standard Oil Company and afterwards for the Sinclair Corporation. Returned from Washington in 1925 and took his seat in the fifth Parliament as a Deputy for Tehran. Is a narrow-minded and bigoted Nationalist, and is, moreover, very anti-British, and particularly spiteful to people he does not like. He is not popular with his compatriots, but, as a former colleague of Mustaufi, was appointed in May 1927 to the post of Minister of Public Works, vacated by Mehdi Quli Khan Hidayet on appointment as president of the Supreme Court of Appeal. He has unfortunately a pernicious influence with the American Legation and Financial Mission. Owing to his original connexion with the latter and his command of English, he is on intimate terms with Dr. Millspaugh and his coadjliters. For the first time for many years he came to His Majesty’s Legation on the occasion of the King's Birthday party on the 3rd June. It is possible he may be appointed before long to replace Prince Arfa as Persian representative at the League of Nations. 1927. Mirza Hussein Khan Ala married the daughter of the late Mirza Abul Ghassem Khan, Nasr-ul-Mulk, ex-Regent of Persia, in July, and was shortly after wards appointed Persian Minister in Paris and first Persian delegate to the League of Nations. 1928. Attended the League Assembly in September 1928 as second Persian delegate. Attended the Afes^fffily at Lugano in the same capacity in December 1928. 27. Mirza Fathullah Khan Pakramn (former title Amir Arfa’). 1926. Born about 1885. First came into public view as a member of the second Ma jlis in 1909. and shortly afterwards obtained the post of Persian consul-general inConstantinople, although he had no previous career in any Government department. From Constantinople he went to Egypt as consul-general, and later became rersian Minister there, until he returned to Tehran early in 1925. In 1925 he became C ue of the Russian and Turkish Section in the Ministry for Foreign Ailairs ibe Soviet Embassy protested against this appointment at first on the score tha , i lvn1 ^ been very many years in Egypt, he must be a British Agent. Finally, the ov^ Embassy withdrew its objections, and, when Ansari became Foreign Minis cr^i July 1926, Pakravan had become so persona grata with the Soviet representatives that, it is said, they asked Ansari to appoint him Under-Secretary. He has occupied the post of Under-Secretary ever since, and has been in charge of the Ministry during Ansari’s absence in Moscow. He is a pleasant and conscientious young man, who appears to try his best to discharge his duties. He, however, has not very much influence, and can hardly be described as clever. Having been absent from Persia for sixteen years, he still teels rather out of touch with things Persian, and makes no secret of his desire to have another congenial post in Europe as soon as one falls vacant. 1928. Appointed as Persian Minister to Rome in December 1928. 28. Mirza Zein-ul-Abidin Rahnama (formerly known as Sheikh-Araqein Zadeh). 1926. Born about 1888. The son of the late Sheikh-ul-Araqein, a Persian subject and a small mujtehid of Kerbela. Rahnama was educated in Iraq and came to Persia about 1910.' He was a member of the Democrat organisation, and edited, firstly, the newspaper “Rahnama,” and, subsequently, the semi-official paper “Iran.” He was elected a Deputy to the fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis. Went to Europe in 1923 on a mission intended to “boom ” Persia, and stayed most of the time in Paris. Was appointed Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Public Works at the end of 1926 and Under-Secretary to the Ministry of the Interior in April 1927. In June 1927 he became assistant to the Prime Minister. Rahnama is an ambitious young man with plenty of ‘‘ push. ’ ’ In 1926 he found that he could not realise his ambition of obtaining a Government post, which he hopes may culminate in a Ministry, unless he discarded his turban and gave up his designation of “sheikh.” He accordingly adopted the usual Persian head-dress and became simply Mirza Zein-ul-Abidin Rahnama, and immediately resigned his seat in the Majlis to occupy successively three posts of the rank of Under-Secretary. He is certainly clever, in certain ways, and intelligent. As a journalist he was fairly scrupulous, and certainly did not indulge in the campaign of blackmail, which most of his journalist colleagues did, during the years 1921-25. He is typical of the modern young Persia, ambitious, enthusiastic and unreliable. Speaks a little French. 1928. Was dismissed from his post as assistant to the Prime Minister in January 1928 and fell from favour. He, as a journalist, accompanied the Shah on his journey to Khuzistan in October 1928, and he appears to be working his way back to favour. 29. Sheikh AH Dashti. 1926. Born about 1887. Educated in the Holy Places of Iraq. Returned to Persia about 1922 and edited a newspaper called the “ Shafaq Surkh ' (the ruddy twilight). As an editor he became notorious for slanderous abuse and the extortion of blackmail, and his abuse of Great Britain and British statesmen was frequently the subject of complaint from His Majesty’s Legation to the Persian Government. Elected a Deputy to the fifth Majlis, his letters of credit were turned down and he was refused a seat by the Parliamentary Commission, whose duty it was to scrutinise his election proceedings. He was prominent in the abortive republican movement in 1924, and is said to have received and pocketed large sums from the Serdar Sepah (Reza Shah), on whose behalf he worked. Having acquired a fair share of thisworld’s goods, he became more human and ceased the abuse and vituperation for which he had become notorious. He espoused the cause of Reza Shah as against Ahmed Shah, and was elected a Deputy to the sixth term of the Majlis (1926). He still edits his paper, for which he receives privately a subsidy from His Majesty. He, like Rahnama, has abandoned his sheikh’s turban for an ordinary Persian Pm and has the same ambitions to obtain a ministerial post. A hot-headed fire brand with neither scruples nor principles, and to whom all means are good if they will help him to attain his ends. 1927. Dashti was invited to Moscow in October to attend the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Bolshevik regime. From there he went to Berlin and Paris, and was still absent from Persia at the end of the year. 1928. Returned from Europe early in 1928. Elected a Deputy to the seventh term of the Majlis (opened the 6th October, 1928). 30. Mirza Hussein Khan Samiyi (Adib-es-Sultaneh). 1926. A native of Resht. Born about 1878. Has a career in the Ministry of Interior and has been Governor of Resht. In 1921 was appointed Minister of Public Works in the Cabinet of Mirza Ahmed Khan (Qawam-es-Sultaneh), and held the same post in the Cabinet of Mirza Hassan Khan Pirnia (Mushir-ed-Dowleh) which followed. In March 1923 he became Acting Minister of Interior until June of the same year. When Serdar Sipah became Prime Minister, Samiyi was appointed as his assistant until, in August 1924, he was appointed Minister of Justice. At the beginning of 1926 he was appointed Governor of Tehran and held that post until June 1927, when he was appointed Minister of Interior. Is a pleasant man, but of little influence. He speaks no foreign language and is not very active or intelligent. 31. Amir Lashkar Abdullah Khan Tahmasm. 1926. Born about 1878, the son of Mirza Hassan of Demavend in the Tehran district. Entered the cadet school of the Persian Cossack Brigade at the age of 20. Served in the Cossack Brigade and gained rapid promotion, largely through Ahmed Shah’s patronage. In 1919 he was A.D.C. General to Ahmed Shah and commander of his bodyguard. After Reza Khan's coup d Etat in 1921, he was removed from the Shah’s staff, as Reza Khan distrusted his influence. He succeeded in gaining his confidence, was given the rank of Sartip in the reorganised army, and sent to Tabriz. Was promoted to the rank of Amir Lashkar and to the command of the North-Western Division. He acquired considerable influence in Azerbaijan and aroused the apprehensions of Reza Khan, who was not convinced that he did not harbour some sentiments of loyalty to the Qajars. He was recalled to Tehran in July 1925, and on Reza’s accession to the throne was appointed Minister for War. His elevation above the heads of his brother generals aroused a storm of jealousy, and a successful intrigue brought about his downfall. He was restored to favour before long, and is employed by the Shah on delicate missions. He is an able man of wider outlook and much more reasonable views than other senior officers of the Persian army. He is generally respected by the troops and has a less unsavoury reputation among civilians than other military commanders. He speaks Russian well and French, but has little to do with any Europeans. He has acquired comfortable wealth and owns property at Demavend. 1927. Amir Lashkar Abdullah Khan Tahmaspi was appointed Minister of Public Works on the 2nd November, 1927. 1928. Ambushed by Lurs between Burujird and Khoremmabad on the 3rd April, 1928, and mortally wounded. Died the 4th April at Burujird.16 r 32. Sartiy Morteza Khan. 1926. Born about 1891, the son of Mirza Ali Akbar, a small shopkeeper in the village of Sardasht, near Tehran, who afterwards acquired an unsavoury reputation. In 1907 Morteza Khan entered the Cossack Cadet School. Received his comniis^uon in 1912. Learnt Russian, early showed strong pro-Russian sympathies, and sequently gained rapid promotion. Became Naib Sarhang (lieutenant-colonel) in 1919, and Sarhang (colonel) in 1920. During all his service he had been intimate with Reza Khan. Accompanied him to Tehran for the d’Etat of 1921. Was promoted Sartip and given command of the Central Division. He is at present (1927) a very loyal supporter of Reza Shah, but will acknowledge no other master. He is active, a strict disciplinarian, intelligent, very ambitious and jealous. His military ideas and his general education are ver y limited, but he is anxious to learn. He is not popular, but is feared and respected by the troops. Keeps aloof from foreigners generally, but is at heart friendly to Russians of the old regime. A strong opponent of foreign interference in Persia. If anything were to happen to Reza Khan, he would probably attempt to make himself Dictator of Persia, and might then welcome foreign support. In spite of his determination and energy, it is doubtful if he has the qualities necessary for success. 1927. Sartip Morteza Khan fell from favour in July 1927 and was put under arrest for a short time for an unknown reason. His accounts were examined, but nothing was found against him. He was released shortly afterwards, but has consistently refused to seek reinstatement. The Shah would, by this act, appear to have turned a loyal servant into an enemy. 1928. Returned to favour in the autumn of 1928, being appointed Inspector of the Army. Created an Amir Lashkar (General of Division), November 1928. 33. Ami?’ Lashkar Ahmad Agha. 1926. Born about 1884, son of Taqi Agha Khan, who reached the rank of colonel in the old Persian regular army. The family comes from Ardebil, and were before that immigrants from the Caucasus. In 1899 Ahmad Agha enlisted in the Persian Cossack Brigade. In 1900 he was sent to the Cadet School; commissioned into the cavalry in 1904, promoted Sultan (captain) in 1906, yavar (major) in 1916 and sarhang (colonel) in 1919. He took part in the operations against the Jangalis, was promoted sartip in 1921, appointed to command the Western Division and promoted Amir Lashkar in 1923. Was recalled on account of his shameless robbery, and particularly for his treacherous oppression of the Lurs, but, being a favourite of Reza Shah's, was appointed to the command of the amnieh (gendarmerie). In July 1926 he was sent to replace the General Officer Commanding the North-Western Division, whose conduct was unsatisfactory, and he now (1927) combines the command of this division with the command of the gendarmerie. He is a man of considerable energy and ambition. Like his great rival, Mqrteza Khan (q-v.), he will accept no master but the Shah. He is determined, intelligent, but ill-educated, inclined to be tyrannical and socially quite agreeable. He likes European society, and has on a few occasions been friendly and helpful to British interests. In his early days of power he robbed shamelessly, but he has now learnt to rob with tact. 1927. Recalled from his command of the North-Western Division in October, but still retains command of the gendarmerie. 1928. Appointed in the spring of 1928 to command the Persian army in Luristan. He was able to pacify Luristan by the beginning of the summer.* 17 34. Sartip Habibullah Khan Shaibani. 1926. Born about 1885, the son of Nazm-ed-Dowleh, who belonged to a middle-class family of Kashan. In 1906 he went to St. Cyr, graduated in 1910 and joined a - ^Ju;eneh regiment. Returned to Persia in 1913 and was commissioned into the k. /edish gendarmerie as a sultan (captain). Was highly regarded by the Swedish officers, and was promoted to yavar (major) in 1914. Had strong anti-Russian and consequently anti-Ally sympathies, and joined the Muhajirin in 1915. Returned to Tehran in 1918 and re-entered the gendarmerie. He appears to have got into touch with Reza Khan in 1920, and, previous to the coup d'htat, he was working in his interests. He became sarhang (colonel) in 1921, served in the operations against the Jangalis and against Simko. Promoted sartip (brigadier-general) in 1922, and in 1923 he was sent to France in charge of Persian military students. He entered the French Staff College and graduated with distinction in 1925. Was Persian repre sentative at the League of Nations Arm^Traffic Conference of 1925, and was very sore at the success of the British representative in getting the Persian Gulf included in the maritime zone. In 1926 he was appointed Acting Chief of the General Staff. He is a man of independent views, inclined to narrow-mindedness and rigidity. He has a strong sense of discipline, does not play at all to the gallery and is opposed to Persia making hasty attempts to play the role of a civilised nation. His military ideas are conservative and sound. He is perhaps the only French-trained officer who has not been led away from a realisation of realities. He regards Russia as a dangerous enemy, other European Powers, with the exception of Great Britain, as being of little importance to Persia. He has a fair understanding of the motives underlying British policy, and believes that Great Britain will always sacrifice Persia for her own interests. He thinks Great Britain can and should help Persia in her own interests. He is patriotic, and will stubbornly oppose anything he considers derogatory to Persian sovereignty or detrimental to Persian independence. He is remarkably honest. He is free from some of the worst Persian failings, but also lacks some of the Persian graces. He is comparatively prompt in action and direct in speech. He has little sympathy with the upper classes of his country, particularly with Persian officialdom. In the army he is often nicknamed “ Farangi,” more on account of his un-Persian characteristics than for any imitation of Europeans; but he is acquiring increasing respect. 1928. He resigned the post of Chief of the General Staff in March owing to a disagree ment with certain orders issued by the Shah. Was appointed Minister of Public Works in May 1928. 35. Amir Lashkar Amanullah Mirza Jahanbani. . 1926. Born about 1890, the son of Amanullah Mirza, Zia-ed-Dowleh (a descendant of Path Ali Shah), who committed suicide in the British consulate in Tabriz, where he had taken refuge, in 1917. The present Amanullah Mirza joined the Persian Cossack Artillery School in 1907. In 1910 he was sent to the military school in Moscow, graduated in 1913, and was for two years attached to the Imperial Guard. In 1916 he rejoined the Persian Cossack Division with the rank of sultan (captain). He was then saturated with Russian ideas and popular with Russians of the old regime. He backed Reza Khan at the time of the coup d’Etat and subsequently distinguished himself in the operations against Simko, mainly by having the sense to take the advice of certain Tsarist Russian officers whom he had attached to his staff. He became Chief of the General Staff in 1922. He visited France and England in 1923. He was carefully watched during the manoeuvres that led to the deposition of the Qajars, but showed no disposition to oppose the ejection of his royal cousin. He was removed from the post of Chief of the General Staff in 1926 for taking things too easily. Again acquired the Shah’s favour and was appointed to command the Eastern Division in August 1926. He is a pleasant and agreeable man, when he is not suffering from wdnd in the head, which is regrettably often. He is intelligent, fairly well-educated, is enthusiastic about sport, a fair polo and tennis player, and has done much to [18830] dencourage sport in the Persian army. He likes amusement and European women, particularly Russians. He is of an easy-going temperament, lacking in determination of character and definiteness of opinion; but conciliatory, and does not fleece or oppress the people. Lacks judgment, and is prone to adopt new ideas and new machines without considering their suitability; but is gradually acquiring sense. He is inclined to imitate Westerners without discrimination. He is not unfriendly to Englishmen, but finds Frenchmen and Russians of the old regime more congenw*? 1928. Organised and commanded the expedition for the pacification of Persian Baluchistan in the autumn of 1928. Created an Amir Lashkar (General of Division) in November 1928 for his services. 36.

He enlisted in the Cossack Division in 1895 and, through his father’s influence, eventually received a commission in the Supply Department. There he happily spent his years of service until he was promoted sartip in 1919. He joined Reza Khan in the coup d’Etat, and was appointed to command the Southern Division with the rank of Amir Lashkar in 1922. His principal characteristic is an unquestioning devotion to Reza Shah. He takes no interest in politics, regards all Europeans alike and has nd strong objection to any of them; will take an unlimited quantity of bribes, but does not go out of his way to extort them. On the other hand, he is too easy-going to check oppression by his subordinates. He has probably never heard of strategy; his tactics are limited to firing off his guns. He has retained his position principally by allowing his clever and energetic Chief of the Staff to do the work. 1928. Recalled from his command of the Southern Division in July 1928, which was divided up into separate units. 37. Sartiv Muhammad Khan Shahbakhteh. 1926.

He attached himself to Reza Khan, whose influence with Starosselski secured his promotion to sarhang (colonel) in 1919. After Reza Khan’s coup d’Etat he was given command of the Ahan regiment of infantry; in 1925 he was promoted sartip and given command of an infantry brigade in Tehran; and in 1926 he was sent to command the Western Division. He is almost entirely uneducated, is boorish in manner, has no conception of politics, has no relations with foreigners and is said to be fanatical. The Shah regards him as a stupid, but soundly practical, officer and a loyal follower. 1928. Recalled in the spring of 1928 for accepting too many bribes. Came to Tehran and managed to ingratiate himself with the Shah. Was appointed to command the Persian troops in Kurdistan shortly afterwards. 38. Mirza Yahya Khan (Itimad-ed-Doirleh) 1928.

PERSIAN MINISTER OF THE COURT. 1 3 z a a l, 8 e »r n b a i- ill n-. ys [E ) His Highness Mirza Abdul Husein Khan Timurtash, Minister of the Court to the Shah of Persia, is due to arrive in London to-day. His Highness is on a short visit to Europe and is coming to England for the first time. Although his visit is unofficial in character, he will be present at the Royal Garden Party at Buckingham Palace this afternoon. His Highness has had an interesting career, and as Minister of the Court holds a position of great importance as head of the Royal Household, a post which is independent of the rise and fall of Cabinets and brings him into the closest and most confidential relations with his Sovereign. Timurtash Khan, who comes of a distin guished Persian family with large estates in Khorassan, was educated in the Corps de Cadets in St. Petersburg and afterwards in a Russian military academy. He returned to Persia at the time of the introduction of the Constitution in 1906, joined the Young Persia Party, and sat for Khorassan in the second, third, fourth, and fifth Parliaments, in which he became a prominent member. In 1919 Timurtash Khan, who was given the title of fSardar Muazzam, was appointed Governor-General of Gilan, but after about a year he returned to Parliament, again as member for Khorassan, and entered the Cabinet rank for the first time as Minister of Justice in the Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s Cabinet (January-May, 1922), and became Minister of Commerce, Agriculture, and Public Works under the present Shah when he was, as Riza Khan, the Sardar Sipah, Prime Minister (October, 1923), before his accession to the throne of Persia in December, 1925. Soon after the coronation of the present Shah in April, 1926, Timurtash Khan was appointed Minister of the Court, and has held that position since with great ability and distinction. In August, 1926, his High ness was sent by the Shah on a special mission to Moscow, and in November of that year to Angora. In collaboration with Sir Robert Clive, the British Minister in Teheran, he has been instrumental in adjusting various out standing matters between Great Britain and Persia and in reaching the agreements which were announced by Sir Austen Chafnberlain in the House of Commons on May 14, when ce spoke of “ the energetic collaboration which the Persian Minister of the Court has shown.”m jd Minute Paper. 4 / SECRET.

Owing to the sudden and unexpected death of Amid the newly appointed Acting Minister for foreign Affairs, he was appointed to succeed him in february 1929.

Is an agreeable and well educated man. Speafcs French fluently. He owes his new appointment entirely to the Minister of Court with whom he is on terms of intimate friendship. It remains to be seen whether he will instil any life into the Ministry or expedite the transaction of current affairs.ffiJSSEIB QUU KEAH NIMI QAEAGO^IOU• (AEIE NIZAH)^; Born in 1883, eldest son of the late Amir Nizam, A member of the Qaragozlou family of Hama dan and a nephew of the late Regent, Nasr-ul-Mulk.

Being a rich man he was imprisoned by Seyid Zia at the coup d'etat in 1921 and made to pay some Tomans 20,000 for his release. Nizam was so disgusted at this treatment that he left Persia and vowed never to return. During his stay in Europe he lost much money at Monte Carlo and Deauville. Teymourtaohe persuaded him to return to Persia when he met him in Europe in 1928. Appointed Grand Master of Ceremonies at the Court in March 1929.

Comes of a small family from Sawad Kuh, in Mazanderan. His father was a Persian and his mother of Caucasian stock, whose parents sought refuge in Persia when certain Caucasian districts were ceded to Russia by Treaty of Turkomanchai. He entered the Persian Cossack Brigade at the ag^r 15 and was employed as a stable boy. He rose from the ranks and gained the approval of the Russian instructors of the brigade for his courage and fearlessness, and whenever an expedition was sent to different parts of Persia to chase brigands or quell disturbances, he seems to have taken part therein. By the beginning of the war he had become a colonel, and in 1921, when the Cossock Brigade, previously transformed into a division, was deprived of its Russian officers and was being reformed after having been severely handled by the Bolshevik forces in North Persia, was in need of a resolute leader, the choice fell on Reza Khan. In March 1921 he marched at its head towards the capital, which he took with the greatest ease, installing Seyid Zia-ed-Din as Premier, himself keeping the command of the army. From that time on he had a rapid rise to power. Six weeks later he became Minister for War, an office which he held until the 31st October, 1925, becoming, in addition thereto, Prime Minister from October 1923 onwards. On the 31st October, 1925, the Majlis deposed Sultan Ahmed Shah and entrusted the provisional direction of the country to Reza Khan Pahlavi. On the 16th December, 1925, in consequence of the decision of the Constituent Assembly, Reza Khan succeeded to the throne of Persia with the title of Reza Shah Pahlavi. He was crowned in April 1926. He is entirely self-educated, but has a natural dignity. He is of strong character and has a great deal of ability and energy. Full of ambition, he has set out to extricate Persia from disintegration and from the morass of inefficiency in which she had fallen and raise her to a position of real independence. In spite of tremendous difficulties, he has succeeded already to a large extent, but it is rather in the nature of a one-man show. Given a sufficient lease of life, he may succeed entirely and at the same time train others to carry on the work. He is not popular, but feared, which perhaps in an oriental country is the greater advantage of the two. The medal has a reverse side. He is insincere in the sense that he regards prevarication and duplicity as fair weapons, thoroughly suspicious of anybody whom he suspects to be cleverer than himself; he therefore prefers to surround himself with mediocrities for the most part. He is avaricious, and all means by which he can acquire this world’s goods are good to him. Since he has become Shah he has lost some of his physical energy and indulges more in opium and arak, or it may be that these have more effect on him in his sedentary life as a monarch than they had when he was living a life in the open; he has certainly grown stouter and has become more bloated, but his old energy sometimes returns, and then he goes on a journey of some weeks to a far distant part of his country, returning the better for his holiday. Whilst he is feared himself by reason of his rough tongue and sometimes rougher methods of treatment which he personally metes out to his subordinates and sometimes to others of his subjects, he himself is not without fear, and it is said that he never goes to bed without having within reach several weapons and that he frequently starts up from his sleep to grasp one of them. He is pitiless towards all whom he suspects of having plotted against him, and even where little or no proof of their culpability is forthcoming they are condemned to a lifelong prison. &amp; Finally, it may be said that his great skill in dealing with his own compatriots has its counterpart in a sublime ignorance of foreign mentality. Beyond once returning from Khuzistan to Tehran via Bagdad, he has never been out of Persia. 2. Mirza Abdul Hussein Khan Teymoustache (Serdar Moazzam Khorassani). 1926. i B J 0rn ^ ab0ut 1888 of a Khorassan family, he was educated in Russia Was elected a Deputy to the third, fourth, fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis, although he dl( inot take his seat in the sixth term, as he was appointed Minister of Court to Reza Shah Pahlavi before the sixth Parliament was opened. W^as Persian member of the mixed financial commission, 1916-17. Appointed Governor of Gilan in 1919 and remained there one year during the first Persian Cossack expedition against the Jungahs. Minister of Justice, January to June 1922. Governor of Kerman.3 September 1923 to April 1924. Minister of Public Works, August 1924-August 1925, and August to the 16th December. After the accession to tne throne of Reza Shah Pahlavi on the 16th December, Teymourtache took over the duties of Minister of the Court. In the summer of 1926 went to Moscow on behalf of the Shah and Persian Government to try and arrange the terms of a commercial and trading ^reement with the Soviet, but was not successful. Visited Germany, Switzerland a^Sl France before returning to Persia in December 1926. Speaks French and Russian very well and understands English. In the Majlis he showed himself a good orator, and as a Minister was generally chosen to answer for the Government in Parliament. Clever and energetic, he has pleasant manners and socially is agreeable. He is of a light-hearted disposition, witty, and often flippant, but a sense of responsibility newly acquired would appear to have added changeable. He is at the same time a confirmed gam! As Minister of the Court he has acquired the position of the Shah's most intimate political adviser. His influence is ubiquitous and his power exceeds that of the Prime Minister. He attends all meetings of the Council of Ministers, and one might compare his position with that of Reicn’s Chancellor, except that he has no direct responsibility. He is an ardent Nationalist, and is mainly responsible for the recent denunciation of treaties with a view to ending the regime of consular jurisdiction. So long as he holds his position as Minister of the Court he will remain the most powerful man in the country after Reza Shah. Teymourtache has, on the whole, strengthened his position, and the Shah appears to rely on him even more than before. Visited Europe in the summer of 1928 and was received by His Majesty King George V in London; also visited Paris, Berlin, Rome and Brussels, where he was entertained by each Government. Returned to Persia at end of September. Granted by the Shah title of “Highness” (Jenab Ashraf) on his return in September as a mark of Royal appreciation of his services. Has maintained, and even increased, his influence and prestige during 1928. and his satellites, Firuz Mirza (No. 8) and Daver (No. 12), on the one hand and on the other hand Mohammad Khan, chief of police, and Kerim Agha Buzurjmihri (No. 45), helped by the Shah’s principal wife. The struggle ended with the arrest and confinement of Prince Firuz in June and with that of Mohammad Khan in December. The break-up of the Teymourtache triumvirate and the latter's inability to help Prince Firuz in his trouble has lessened the glamour of Teymourtache's influence in the eyes of the public, but the Shah still appears to hold him in high favour. The disappearance from the arena of his arch-enemy must have counterbalanced to a certain extent the loss of Prince Firuz. Formerly known as Mostaufi-el-Mamalek. Age about 57. The son of a former Prime Minister and Minister of Finance who died in 1882, Mirza Hassan Khan inherited large estates and much wealth from his father. He was in Europe from 1900-07, during which time he squandered most of the riches he had inherited. When he returned to Persia in 1907 he was appointed Paymaster-General of the Army. He was elected to the Majlis in 1908, and became in 1909 first Minister of War and then Minister of Finance. In 1910 he was appointed Prime Minister, but resigned in 1911. In 1913 he was again Minister of War and in 1914 again Prime Minister. Resigning in March 1915, he was again called upon in August, and was Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior until December 1915. From June to December 1917 he was a Minister without portfolio, and from January to April 1918 a semblance of gravity to a character which until recently was fickle and 1927. 1928. 1929. During this year a struggle for influence with the Shah between Teymourtache 3. Mirza Hassan Khan Mostaufi. 1926. [20718] b 2■—i A he was again Prime Minister. In July 1920 he again appeared as Minister without portfolio in the Cabinet of Mirza Hassan Khan Pirnia (Mushir-ed-Dowleh), which lasted until November 1920. He held no further appointment until February 1923, when he again assumed the Premiership until June of the same year. After a lapse of more than three years he again became Prime Minister in June 1926, and held office until May 1927, when he resigned. ^ He is a typical old-time Persian gentleman, fond of hawking and hunting, buT a man of weak character and incapable of taking a decision on the most unimportant matter. Completely bereft of any qualities of organisation or administration, he has entirely whittled away the great wealth he inherited from his father. His complete lack of decision was particularly noticeable during his Premiership in 1915, when he weakly allowed the pro-German party to act just as they liked, and for which he acquired a reputation of unfriendliness towards Great Britain and her Allies. It may now be stated he was not unfriendly, but he was too weak and lacking in energy to take any action to stop the intrigues of the Central Powers. His feeble character has not gained any strength by the experience of years, and if he is still incapable of doing bad he is equally incapable of doing good. 1928. Elected as a Deputy for Tehran in the seventh term of the National Assembly (opened the 6th October, 1928), but declined to accept. 4. Mirza Hassan Khan Pirnia, G.C.M.G. (Mushir-ed-Dowleh). 1926. Born about 1872, eldest son of the late Mushir-ed-Dowleh, who was Foreign Minister for many vears and died in 1907. Educated in Russia and speaks French and Russian fluently. Appointed Persian Minister to the Russian Court in 1902. In 1906 he joined the Constitutional party, and was one of the Progressives who were instrumental in obtaining Muzafler-ed-Din Shah’s signature to the Consti tution. He translated from French and Russian many laws on which the Persian Constitution was originally based. In 1907 he went to London as special envoy to announce the accession to the Persian Throne of Mohammad Ali Shah, and was created a G.C.M.G. Became Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs for a few months at the end of 1907 and again at the beginning of 1908. Minister of Justice from July 1908 to January 1909. Has at various times been also Minister of War. Became Prime Minister in March 1915 for a month, in 1920 for four months, in 1922 for six months and in 1923 for five months. He and his brother, Hussein Khan Pirnia, have generally been the two most favoured candidates for the Majlis from Tehran. Mirza Hassan Khan Pirnia is a very intelligent man with a good reputation for honesty among his compatriots, but he is very timorous, and has always preferred to resign his portfolio than face a crisis. Inherited large properties from his father and is very wealthy. 1928. Elected a Deputy for Tehran in the seventh term of the Majlis (opened the 6th October), but refused to accept. 1926 ^ Mirza Hassan Khan Vossuq, G.C.B. (Vossuq-ed-Dowleh). Age about 58. Started his career in the Ministry of Finance. Was a Deputy in the first and second Parliaments, and in 1909 was elected a member of the Nationalist Committee which directed the affairs of State on the dethronement of Mohammad Ali Shah. His first Cabinet appointment was as Minister of Justice in October 1909. In the following month he became Minister of Finance, but resigned in July 1910. In July 1911 he became Minister of Interior, but after a few days he took over the portfolio of Foreign Affairs.

Appointed Minister of Finance in June 1926, but resigned in November to take his seat in Parliament. Speaks French, and is a man of great ability and character. Became unpopular 4 jer the Anglo-Persian Convention, but regained a large measure of popularity after his return in 1926, especially after a most able and convincing defence in Parliament of his actions as Premier during the period August 1918 to June 1920. Has still some bitter enemies, who do not cease to attack him on all possible occasions and who try to prevent him from acquiring the favour of His Majesty the Shah. The mutual antipathy between His Majesty and Vossuq renders the latter’s return to power unlikely. Vossuq’s popularity would appear to have increased, and the suspicions formerly harboured by the Shah seem to have diminished. Vossuq was elected as one of the Tehran Deputies to the seventh term of the Majlis and took his seat. He would, however, prefer to occupy a post in Europe, and it is learned privately from a high authority that he has been offered the Persian Legation in Berlin. Age about 53.

Mehdi Quli Khan Hedayet (Mukhher-es-Sultaneh). 1926.i; * Was very pro-German, and secretly aided their agents in Persia during the governorship of Pars. Became Minister of Justice in November 1917 and again in January 1918, subsequently becoming Minister of Interior in April 1918, when he abetted the Jangalis in their rebellion against the Central Government, and used his official position to carry on propaganda in the South Persia Rifles, which led to soqj^ disaffection. Became Minister of Finance, July to November 1920, and Minister or Public Works, March to June 1923. Deputy in fifth Majlis, 1924r-26. Minister of Public Works. June 1926. Chief judge in High Court of Appeal, April 1927, and appointed Prime Minister in June 1927. Is intelligent and well read. His hatred of Russia caused him to favour the German cause in the Great War, and he became as a result very unfriendly towards Great Britain. Of later years he has been more friendly, endeavours to keep away from political intrigue and spends all his spare time in reading and writing. 1927. Mehdi Quli Khan Hedayet was still Prime Minister at the end of the year, and, after the departure of Dr. Millspaugh, was in addition appointed Administrator- General of Finances. 8. Prince Firuz Mirza, G.C.M.G. (Nusrat-ed-Dowleh ). 1926. Born about 1888. Eldest son of Prince Farman Farma, and great-great grandson of Fath Ali Shah.

Went to Europe in 1912 and studied law\ Returned to Persia in 1915 and became Under-Secretary in the Ministry of JiivStice and Minister of Justice in 1916. Again Minister of Justice in 1918 and Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1919; he accompanied Saltan Ahmed Shah to Europe in 1919, was received by His Majesty King George and created a G.C.M.G., in return for his pro-Ally attitude during the war and his support of the Anglo- Persian Convention, which he helped to negotiate. Returned to Persia at the end of 1920. was arrested with his father by Seyid Zia-ed-Din in February 1921, but was released when Seyid Zia fell from power a few weeks later. He blamed His Majestv’s Government for having allowed him to be arrested, and on his release showed violent anti-British sentiments. Elected a Deputy to the fourth, fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis. Made his peace with His Majesty’s Legation in 1923, and was appointed Governor-General of Ears, 1923—24, v r here he was quite successful. Appointed Minister of Justice, August to December 1925, and Minister of Finance in February 1927. Speaks French extremely well and understands English. Is one of the most intelligent Persians of his age, and a very clever politician. Is not popular with his compatriots, wffio are jealous of his intelligence and resent his unscrupulousness. Received the contents of his own gun in the right arm whilst out hunting in 1922, and has been thereby deprived of the normal use of his right hand. He is, T fear, a very fickle friend of Great Britain, and I have as little confidence in his honesty as the majority of his countrvmen have. Like Teymourtache, whose most intimate friend he is, he is a born gambler. He owes money in every direction, including tailors’ bills in London, which he declines to pay, and for which he would be liable to prosecution should he at any time return to England. At the same time, his ability marks him out as one of the leading men in the country, whether in the Cabinet or in the Majlis, and the Shah, who probably does not trust him, recognises his usefulness. 1927. Firuz Mirza, thanks to the support received from his friend, Teymourtache, has been able to maintain his position as Minister of Finance and, perhaps, even to strengthen it, in spite of much opposition. 1929. Arrested in June 1929 on the Shah’s orders for reasons which have not been disclosed, and kept in confinement in his own house.9. Mirza Alt Quli Khan Ansari (Mushaver-el-Mamalek). 1926. Age about 54.

He became Minister for Foreign Affairs in Farman Farma’s Cabinet, December 1915-February 1916. In 1917 he was appointed assistant to Governor-General in Khorassan. In January 1918 he was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in Mustaufi’s Cabinet and retained that portfolio in the following Cabinet formed by Najaf Quli Bakhtiari (Samsam-es- Sultaneh) in May 1918. The Cabinet was reconstructed after a month and a half, and Ansari was replaced only, however, to return as Minister for Foreign Affairs in Mirza Hassan Khan Vossuq’s Cabinet formed on the 7th August, 1918. At the end of that year Persia sent a mission to Paris to attend the Peace Conference, and at Ahmed Shah’s instigation Ansari was appointed as head of that mission. The mission was abortive and Ansari was appointed in 1919 Persian Ambassador to Constantinople. In 1920 he w T as appointed to Moscow, and w T ith Taqizadeh was instrumental in drawing up the Perso-Soviet Treaty of February 1921. Ansari remained as Ambassador in Moscow until July 1926, when he returned to Tehran to take up the appointment of Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. He returned to Moscow on a special mission in March 1927, and is still there. He talks Russian and French fluently and is quite a pleasant man socially. He is fairly intelligent but carries little weight and is not too truthful. He has a reputation amongst his compatriots for demagogy, lack of character, and for making money out of appointments to posts in the service under his authority. As Minister for Foreign Affairs he is most unsatisfactory, and one need never hope to get anything settled through his good offices. 1927. Mirza Ali Quli Khan Ansari was able to bring the Russo-Persian negotiations over outstanding questions to a successful issue by the autumn, and has remained on in Moscow as Special Ambassador whilst still nominally Minister for Foreign Affairs in Tehran. 1928. Visited Warsaw', where he put the finishing touches to the Perso-Polish Commercial Treaty, Czechoslovakia and Berlin early in 1928. Again appointed Persian Ambassador in Moscow in May 1928. 10. Mirza Hussein Khan Pirnia (Mutamin-ul-Mvlk). 1926. Born about 1875, the second son of Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Educated in France and speaks French and English fluently. On his return to Tehran in 1902 became secretary to his father, who was then Minister for Foreign Affairs. Received his first appointment in the Cabinet as Minister of Education in 1918. Minister without portfolio in 1920. He has generally preferred a parliamentary to a ministerial career, and he has been elected to every Parliament since the beginning of the Constitution. Was elected President for the whole term of the third and fourth Parliaments and for the greater part of the fifth, and again in February 1927 succeeded Tadayun as President of the sixth Parliament; is a very impartial and firm President. He is an intelligent man of firm character, but of a modest and retiring nature. Is studious and well read. 1928.

He returned in 1924, his innocence having been mean while established. Became Minister for Foreign Affairs from August 1924 until December 1925, when he resigned. Speaks no foreign language. Is a man of great common sense and is intelligent. As Minister for Foreign Affairs was extremely friendly to His Majesty’s Legation and used his best endeavours to effect the settlement of outstanding questions. Is not popular with many of his compatriots in high places owing to his straightforward character and outspokenness. 1929. Appointed Minister of Finance in November 1929. 12. Ali Akber Khan Daver. 1926. Born about 1887. A son of a subordinate official in the private treasury of Muzaffer-ed-Din Shah, he was educated in Tehran. He started his career as Chief of Cabinet to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in 1909, and subsequently transferred to the Ministry of Justice, where he rose to be a Public Prosecutor. In 1910 he accompanied some Persian children to Switzerland as their tutor and then stayed there to study law, finally taking his degree at Geneva. He returned to Persia in 1921 and edited a newspaper. He was elected a Deputy to the fourth, fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis, and in addition exercised his profession as a lawyer. Elected to the Constituent Assembly in December 1925, he was elected by the members of that assembly to revise the constitutional law in a way which would permit the accession of Reza Khan as Shah. He did so, and successfully defended the revision before the assembly in open session, for which he earned the Shah's gratitude. He was appointed Minister of Public W'orks, December 1925 to June 1926, when he took his seat in Parliament. Daver is a studious, intelligent and well-read man, a capable lawyer, and speaks French very well. He has founded a Radical party in Persia which has many adherents. Is generally regarded as a coming man ” by his compatriots, although he is not entirely free from those common sins so frequently found amongst Persian politicians—demagogy and untruthfulness. As Minister of Justice, to which post he was appointed in February 1927, he displayed a feverish energy in sweeping away the old Adliyeh Courts and paving the way for the Shah’s declaration in April that the Capitulations would be abolished. He is likely to remain Minister of Justice for the present, whatever Cabinets may come and go, so long as he retains the Shah’s confidence. 13. Seyed Mohammad Tadayun. 1926. y Born about 1884. A native of Birjand, educated in Tehran, where he graduated and became a schoolmaster.

Was one of the principal protagonists of the Republican movement in 1924, and is said to have appropriated for himself a large part of the funds put at his disposal for the realisation of that object. As President of the Majlis he was quite a success, being impartial and strict in upholding the rules of the House. He is undoubtedly an intelligent man and has a very pleasant manner. Speaks no European language, although he is now learning French. 1927. Seyed Mohammad Tadayun resigned his portfolio on the 3rd December on finding that his opinions did not coincide with those of his colleagues in the Cabinet, but he resumed office nine days later at the request of the Shah.9 1928 . Resigned his portfolio as Minister of Public Instruction on the 7th January, it is said, at the order of His Majesty the Shah. He appears to have fallen into disfavour on account of the personal animosity towards him of Teymourtache, the Minister of Court. He tried to obtain election to the seventh term of the Majlis, &gt;Ht the Court vetoed his candidature. The set-back may, however, only be a wnporary one, and at the end of 1928 there are signs that he may return to favour. 14. Mirza Seyid Mehdi Khan Fatemi (Imad-es-Sultaneh). 1926. Born about 1886.

As a young man he was addicted to the use of opium and fond of gambling, but since he has reached Cabinet rank he appears to have cast aside to a certain extent his former bad habits, with beneficial results to his health and intelligence. As a Deputy and as a Minister he has been uniformly popular and successful. Is socially agreeable, although he speaks no foreign language but Persian and is friendly to His Majesty’s Legation. 1928.

Started his career as a religious teacher, and dabbled in politics for years before he entered Parliament as a Member for Isfahan in 1914. He was a leading member of the Provisional Government set up by the Muhajerin, or pro-German exiles, at Kermanshah in 1915, and went to Constantinople, only returning to Persia early in 1918. Took refuge in the mosque at Shah Abdul Azim as a protest against the Cabinet of Samsam-es-Sultaneh in the summer of 1918 and worked hard to bring in the Vossuq-ed-Dowleh Cabinet of that year. Quarrelled with Vossuq over the Anglo- Persian Convention, and gained much popularity thereby. Has been a prominent Deputy in each succeeding Parliament. Mudarris, more than any individual Persian, caused the failure of the republican movement in 1924. He leads a very simple life and is much revered by the lower classes, who frequent his house greatly. They find in him a readv friend, and he is always willing to help them in their troubles. He is quite fearless and frank and expresses his opinions openly and freely. Nobody escapes his criticisms, from His Majesty the Shah to the lowest in the land. This fearlessness nearly cost him his life in October 1926, when a serious attempt to assassinate him was made one day in the very early morning in a narrow street a few yards away from an extremely busy thoroughfare. He was badly wounded in three places, but recovered. He is extremely cute and, for a cleric of his upbringing, far-sighted, but at times a demagogue and very obstinate; an ardent patriot, but lacking in that cultured intelligence which alone can prevent his obstinacy from degenerating into narrow-mindedness. His greatest desire is to be the counsellor of Kings and Cabinets 1928. Was not allowed to be elected as a Deputy for the seventh term of the Majlis. Exiled to Khorassan in October 1928. 19.

Hostile to the Allied cause in the Great War, he was bought by the Germans in 1915, but that did not prevent him obtaining money from the Russians as well. An intriguer and dishonest. When Minister of Finance in 1917, he caused the grain in the Government depositories to be sold to pay up arrears of salaries due to Government servants, and by this act was partly responsible for the mortality caused in Tehran by the famine which followed the crop failure in 1917.

He returned in 1921 and w T as again elected to the Majlis, where he led the very small Socialist group. Was again elected to the fifth term of the Majlis and was leader of the Minority.

Was not elected to the sixth Majlis in 1926, as by that time he had lost any popularity he ever had. Speaks no foreign languages. Is a demagogue and time-serving politician.

Hovannes Khan is a well-read man and somewhat of a litteraire. He has translated many of Shakespeare’s works into Armenian and has a great desire to complete that work. Has been and still is the prot^gd, friend and confidant of Nasr-ul-Mulk, whose political views he shares. Talks English and French fluently. In consequence of his long absence from Persia and consequent loss of touch with the more modern political circles there, his political influence is not great, but he is highly respected. 1927. Was appointed Persian Minister to the Court of St. James in Julv, and left to take over his duties there in August. 1929. Recalled from London in June 1929 and replaced by Taqizadeh.

Born in Tabriz about 1880, the son of a small preacher in the mosque. Educated in Tabriz, he used to haunt the booksellers shops in that town, where he showed great eagerness to obtain knowledge. In his early youth he was an ardent Nationalist and was connected with the Nationalist movement in Persia from its inception. He founded the Azerbaijan Club in Tehran and was one of the most prominent members of the first Majlis. Mohammad Ali Shah hated and feared him particularly, and when the Shah made his coup d’Etat in June 1908 against the Majlis, Taqizadeh took refuge in His Majesty’s Legation. The Shah demanded that he should be given up, but the demand was refused and Taqizadeh finally received an amnesty on condition that he left Persia for a time. He went to London and Cambridge, but returned to Tabriz at the end of 1908. He was elected a member of the second Majlis in 1909. He was a member of the Nationalist Committee formed after the taking of Tehran in July 1909 by the Nationalist force and the abdication of Mohammad Ali Shah, to arrange the government of the country. He left Tehran for Europe in July 1910. He was elected to the third and fourth Majlisses,but did not take his seat. He travelled in Europe and America between 1914 and 1923, staying for years in Berlin, where he edited a newspaper called “ Kaveh.” During this time the mujtehids excommunicated him for having printed certain articles which they alleged were in contravention of Islam. He negotiated the Perso-Soviet Commercial Treaty in Moscow in February 1921, and returned finally to Persia in 1924. He was elected to the fifth term of the Majlis, 1924-26, and to the sixth term in 1926. He went to America in 1926 as Persian representative at the Philadelphia Exhibition. Taqizadeh is a well-read man and widely travelled, but no longer enjoys the popularity which he once did in the early days of the Constitution. He no longer shows the zeal and energy which formerly gained him many adherents, and although at times his speeches in the Majlis mark him as a man of common sense and moderation, he seems unwilling to wish to play a role in the politics of the country. This desire to take a back seat is in sharp contrast to the enthusiasm and zeal of the fiery young orator of the first days of the Constitution and gives his countrymen the impression that he is played out. He has been mentioned as a possible Minister in more than one recent Cabinet, and it is said that definite offers were made to him, but if they were, they were never accepted, and he has been content to sit in the Majlis. 1929. Appointed Governor-General for Khorassan in January 1929. Recalled in May 1929 and appointed Persian Minister in London, whither he went in July. 26. Mirza Hussein Khan Ala (Moin-el-Vezareh). 1926.

He remained as Chief of Cabinet to successive Foreign Ministers until 1915. Minister of Public Works in Mustaufi’s Cabinet, January 1918, and also in Samsam-es-Sultaneh’s Cabinet, May to August 1918. This Cabinet abrogated the Treaty of Turkomanchai and announced its intention of abolishing exterritorial privileges. Mirza Hussein Khan was particularly hostile to Sir C. Marling, His Majesty’s Minister, and used his brother, then Persian Minister in London, to make complaints to the Foreign Office. He accompanied the abortive Persian Mission to the Peace Conference in 1918 at Paris. Appointed Persian Minister in Madrid in 1919 and Minister in Washington in 1920. Conducted negotiations in Washington in 1921-22 for the American Financial Mission to Persia, after his abortive attemps to obtain the11 Northern Persia oil concession first for the Standard Oil Company and afterwards for the Sinclair Corporation. Returned from Washington in 1925 and took his seat in the fifth Parliament as a Deputy for Tehran. . . , Is a narrow-minded and bigoted Nationalist, and is, moreover, very anti-Dritisn, and particularly spiteful to people he does not like. He is not popular W1 fh bis compatriots, but, as a former colleague of Mustaufi, was appointed in May 1927 the post of Minister of Public Works, vacated by Mehdi Quli Khan Hidayet on appointment as president of the Supreme Court of Appeal. He has unfortunately a pernicious influence with the American Legation and Financial Mission. Owing to his original connexion with the latter and his command of English, he is on intimate terms with Dr. Millspaugh and his coadjutors. For the first time for many years he came to His Majesty’s Legation on the occasion of the King’s Birthday party cm the 3rd June. It is possible he may be appointed before long to replace Prince Arfa as Persian representative at the League of Nations. 1927. Mirza Hussein Khan Ala married the daughter of the late Mirza Abul Ghassem Khan, Nasr-ul-Mulk, ex-Regent of Persia, in July, and was shortly after wards appointed Persian Minister in Paris and first Persian delegate to the League of Nations. 1928. Attended the League Assembly in September 1928 as second Persian delegate. Attended the Assembly at Lugano in the same capacity in December 1928. 27 Mirza Fathullah Khan Pakravan (former title Amir Arfa'). 1926. Born about 1885. First came into public view as a member of the second Majlis in 1909, and shortly afterwards obtained the post of Persian consul-general in Constantinople, although he had no previous career in any Government department. From Constantinople he went to Egypt as consul-general, and later became Persian Minister there, until he returned to Tehran early in 1925. In 1925 he became Chief of the Russian and Turkish Section in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Soviet Embassy protested against this appointment at first on the score that, having been very many years in Egypt, he must be a British Agent. Finally, the Soviet Embassy withdrew its objections, and, when Ansari became Foreign Minister in July 1926, Pakravan had become so persona grata with the Soviet representatives that, it is said, they asked Ansari to appoint him Under-Secretary. He has occupied the post of Under-Secretary ever since, and has been in charge of the Ministry during Ansari’s absence in Moscow. He is a pleasant and conscientious young man, who appears to try his best to discharge his duties. He, however, has not very much influence, and can hardly be described as clever. Having been absent from Persia for sixteen years, he still feels rather out of touch with things Persian, and makes no secret of his desire to have another congenial post in Europe as soon as one falls vacant. 1928. Appointed as Persian Minister to Rome in December 1928. 28. Mirza Zein-ul-Abidin Rahnama (formerly known as Sheikh-Araqein Zadeh). 1926. Born about 1888. The son of the late Sheikh-ul-Araqein, a Persian subject and a small mujtehid of Kerbela. Rahnama was educated in Iraq and came to Persia about 1910. He was a member of the Democrat organisation, and edited, firstly, the newspaper “Rahnama,” and, subsequently, the semi-official paper “Iran.” He was elected a Deputy to the fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis. Went to Europe in 1923 on a mission intended to “boom ” Persia, and stayed most of the time in Paris. Was appointed Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Public Works at the end of 1926 and Under-Secretary to the Ministry of the Interior in April 1927. In June 1927 he became assistant to the Prime Minister.Rahnama is an ambitious young man with plenty of “ push.” In 1926 he found that he could not realise his ambition of obtaining a Government post, which he hopes may culminate in a Ministry, unless he discarded his turban and gave up his designation of kC sheikh.’' He accordingly adopted the usual Persian head-dress and became simply Mirza Zein-ul-Abidin Rahnama, and immediately resigned his f ^it in the Majlis to occupy successively three posts of the rank of Under-Secretary. e is certainly clever, in certain ways, and intelligent. As a journalist he was fairly scrupulous, and certainly did not indulge in the campaign of blackmail, which most of his journalist colleagues did, during the years 1921-25. He is typical of the modern young Persia, ambitious, enthusiastic and unreliable. Speaks a little French. 1928. Was dismissed from his post as assistant to the Prime Minister in January 1928 and fell from favour. He, as a journalist, accompanied the Shah on his journey to Khuzistan in October 1928, and he appears to be working his way back to favour. 29. Sheikh All Dashti. 1926. Born about 1887. Educated in the Holy Places of Iraq. Returned to Persia about 1922 and edited a newspaper called the t£ Shafaq Surkh ” (the ruddy twilight). As an editor he became notorious for slanderous abuse and the extortion of blackmail, and his abuse of Great Britain and British statesmen was frequently the subject of complaint from His Majesty’s Legation to the Persian Government. Elected a Deputy to the fifth Majlis, his letters of credit were turned down and he was refused a seat by the Parliamentary Commission, whose duty it was to scrutinise his election proceedings. He was prominent in the abortive republican movement in 1924, and is said to have received and pocketed large sums from the Serdar Sepah (Reza Shah), on whose behalf he worked. Having acquired a fair share of this world’s goods, he became more human and ceased the abuse and vituperation for which he had become notorious. He espoused the cause of Reza Shah as against Ahmed Shah, and was elected a Deputy to the sixth term of the Majlis (1926). He still edits his paper, for which he receives privately a subsidy from His Majesty. He, like Rahnama, has abandoned his sheikh’s turban for an ordinary Persian hat, and has the same ambitions to obtain a ministerial post. A hot-headed fire brand with neither scruples nor principles, and to whom all means are good if they will help him to attain his ends. 1927. Dashti was invited to Moscow in October to attend the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Bolshevik regime. From there he went to Berlin and Paris, and was still absent from Persia at the end of the year. 1928. Returned from Europe early in 1928. Elected a Deputy to the seventh term of the Majlis (opened the 6th October, 1928). 30. Mirza Hussein Khan Samiyi (Adib-es-Sultaneh). A native of Resht. Born about 1878. Has a career in the Ministry of Interior and has been Governor of Resht. In 1921 was appointed Minister of Public Works in the Cabinet of Mirza Ahmed Khan (Qawam-es-Sultaneh), and held the same post in the Cabinet of Mirza Hassan Khan Pirnia (Mushir-ed-Dowleh) which followed. In March 1923 he became Acting Minister of Interior until June of the same year. When Serdar Sipah became Prime Minister, Samiyi was appointed as his assistant until, in August 1924, he was appointed Minister of Justice. At the beginning of 1926 he was appointed Governor of Tehran and held that post until June 1927, when he was appointed Minister of Interior. Is a pleasant man, but of little influence. He speaks no foreign language and is not very active or intelligent.31. Amir Lashkar Abdullah Khan Tahmaspi. 1926. Born about 1878, the son of Mirza Hassan of Demavend in the Tehran district. Entered the cadet school of the Persian Cossack Brigade at the age of 20. Served in the Cossack Brigade and gained rapid promotion, Targelv through Ahmed Shahls patronage. In 1919 he was A.D.C. General to Ahmed Shah and commancr of his bodyguard. After Reza Khan's coup d’Etat in 1921, he was removed from the Shah’s staff, as Reza Khan distrusted his influence. He succeeded in gaining his confidence, w r as given the rank of Sartip in the reorganised army, and sent to Tabriz. Was promoted to the rank of Amir Lashkar and to the command of the North-Western Division. He acquired considerable influence in Azerbaijan and aroused the apprehensions of Reza Khan, who was not convinced that he did not harbour some sentiments of loyalty to the Qajars. He was recalled to Tehran in July 1925, and on Reza’s accession to the throne was appointed Minister for War. His elevation above the heads of his brother generals aroused a storm of jealousy, and a successful intrigue brought about his downfall. He w r as restored to favour before long, and is employed by the Shah on delicate missions. He is an able man of wider outlook and much more reasonable views than other senior officers of the Persian army. He is generally respected by the troops and has a less unsavoury reputation among civilians than other military commanders. He speaks Russian well and French, but has little to do with any Europeans. He has acquired comfortable wealth and owns property at Demavend. 1927. Amir Lashkar Abdullah Khan Tahmaspi was appointed Minister of Public Works on the 2nd November, 1927. 1928. Ambushed by Lurs between Burujird and Khoremmabad on the 3rd April, 1928, and mortally wounded. Died the 4th April at Burujird. 32. Sartip Morteza Khan. 1926. Born about 1891, the son of Mirza Ali Akbar, a small shopkeeper in the village of Sardasht, near Tehran, who afterwards acquired an unsavoury reputation. In 1907 Morteza Khan entered the Cossack Cadet School. Received his commission in 1912. Learnt Russian, early showed strong pro-Russian sympathies, and con sequently gained rapid promotion. Became Naib Sarhang (lieutenant-colonel) in 1919, and Sarhang (colonel) in 1920. During all his service he had been intimate with Reza Khan. Accompanied him to Tehran for the coup d'Etat of 1921. Was promoted Sartip and given command of the Central Division. He is at present (1927) a very loyal supporter of Reza Shah, but will acknowledge no other master. He is active, a strict disciplinarian, intelligent, very ambitious and jealous. His military ideas and his general education are very limited, but he is anxious to learn. He is not popular, but is feared and respected by the troops. Keeps aloof from foreigners generally, but is at heart friendly to Russians of the old regime. A strong opponent of foreign interference in Persia. If anything were to happen to Reza Khan, he would probably attempt to make himself Dictator of Persia, and might then welcome foreign support. In spite of his determination and energy, it is doubtful if he has the qualities necessary for success. 1927. Sartip Morteza Khan fell from favour in July 1927 and was put under arrest for a short time for an unknown reason. His accounts were examined, but nothing was found against him. He was released shortly afterwards, but has consistently refused to seek reinstatement. The Shah would, by this act, appear to have turned a loyal servant into an enemy. 1928. Returned to favour in the autumn of 1928, being appointed Inspector of the Army. Created an Amir Lashkar (General of Division), November 1928.17 1929. Appointed to the chief command of the Persian amnieh (gendarmerie) vice General of Division Amir Agha. 33. Amir Lashkar Ahmad Agha. 1926. Born about 1884, son of Taqi Agha Khan, who reached the rank of colonel in the old Persian regular army. The family comes from Ardebil, and were before that immigrants from the Caucasus. In 1899 Ahmad Agha enlisted in the Persian Cossack Brigade. In 1900 he was sent to the Cadet School; commissioned into the cavalry in 1904, promoted Sultan (captain) in 1906, yavar (major) in 1916 and sarhang (colonel) in 1919. He took part in the operations against the Jangalis, was promoted sartip in 1921, appointed to command the Western Division and promoted Amir Lashkar in 1923. Was recalled on account of his shameless robbery, and particularly for his treacherous oppression of the Lurs, but, being a favourite of Reza Shah’s, was appointed to the command of the amnieh (gendarmerie). In July 1926 he was sent to replace the General Officer Commanding the North-Western Division, whose conduct was unsatisfactory, and he now (1927) combines the command of this division with the command of the gendarmerie. He is a man of considerable energy and ambition. Like his great rival, Morteza Khan (q-v.), he will accept no master but the Shah. He is determined, intelligent, but ill-educated, inclined to be tyrannical and socially quite agreeable. He likes European society, and has on a few occasions been friendly and helpful to British interests. In his early days of power he robbed shamelessly, but he has now learnt to rob with tact. 1927. Recalled from his command of the North-Western Division in October, but still retains command of the gendarmerie. 1928. Appointed in the spring of 1928 to command the Persian army in Luristan. He was able to pacify Luristan by the beginning of the summer. 1929. Made a field-marshal in April 1929 in recognition of his services in Luristan. 34. Sartip Habibullah Khan Shaibani. 1926. Born about 1885, the son of Nazm-ed-Dowleh, who belonged to a middle-class family of Kashan. In 1906 he went to St. Cyr, graduated in 1910 and joined a French regiment. Returned to Persia in 1913 and was commissioned into the Swedish gendarmerie as a sultan (captain). Was highly regarded by the Swedish officers, and was promoted to yavar (major) in 1914. Had strong anti-Russian and consequently anti-Ally sympathies, and joined the Muhajirin in 1915. Returned to Tehran in 1918 and re-entered the gendarmerie. He appears to have got into touch with Reza Khan in 1920, and, previous to the coup d'Etat, he was working in his interests. He became sarhang (colonel) in 1921, served in the operations against the Jangalis and against Simko. Promoted sartip (brigadier-general) in 1922, and in 1923 he was sent to France in charge of Persian military students. He entered the French Staff College and graduated with distinction in 1925. Was Persian repre sentative at the League of Nations Army Traffic Conference of 1925, and was very sore at the success of the British representative in getting the Persian Gulf included in the maritime zone. In 1926 he was appointed Acting Chief of the General Staff. He is a man of independent views, inclined to narrow-mindedness and rigidity. He has a strong sense of discipline, does not play at all to the gallery and is opposed to Persia making hasty attempts to play the role of a civilised nation. His military [20718] Dwm i, 'T 18 ideas are conservative and sound. He is perhaps the only Frencn-trained otiicer who has not been led away from a realisation of realities. He regards Russia as a dangerous enemy, other European Powers, with the exception of Great Britain, as being of little importance to Persia. He has a fair understanding of the motives underlying British policy, and believes that Great Britain will always sacrifice Persia for her own interests. He thinks Great Britain can and should help Persia in h^^ own interests. He is patriotic, and will stubbornly oppose anything he consider derogatory to Persian sovereignty or detrimental to Persian independence. He is remarkably honest. He is free from some of the worst Persian failings, but also lacks some of the Persian graces. He is comparatively prompt in action and direct in speech. He has little sympathy with the upper classes of his country, particularly with Persian officialdom. In the army he is often nicknamed “Farangi,” more on account of his un-Persian characteristics than for any imitation of Europeans; but he is acquiring increasing respect. 1928. He resigned the post of Chief of the General Staff in March owing to a disagree ment with certain orders issued by the Shah. Was appointed Minister of Public Works in May 1928. 1929. Placed en dis'ponibilite in December 1928. Appointed a member of the High Military Council in January 1929. Appointed an Amir Lashkar in June 1929, and given the command of the Southern Division to deal with the rebellion in Pars, where he has remained in chief command. ' 35. Amir Lashkar AmanuUah Mirza Jahanbani. 1926. Born about 1890, the son of Amanullah Mirza, Zia-ed-Dowleh (a descendant of Fath Ali Shah), who committed suicide in the British consulate in Tabriz, where he had taken refuge, in 1917. The present Amanullah Mirza joined the Persian Cossack Artillery School in 1907. In 1910 he was sent to the military school in Moscow, graduated in 1913, and was for two years attached to the Imperial Guard. In 1916 he rejoined the Persian Cossack Division with the rank of sultan (captain). He was then saturated with Russian ideas and popular with Russians of the old regime. He backed Reza Khan at the time of the coup d’Ltat and subsequently distinguished himself in the operations against Simko, mainly by having the sense to take the advice of certain Tsarist Russian officers whom he had attached to his staff. He became Chief of the General Staff in 1922. He visited France and England in 1923. He was carefully watched during the manoeuvres that led to the deposition of the Qajars, but showed no disposition to oppose the ejection of his royal cousin. He was removed from the post of Chief of the General Staff in 1926 for taking things too easily. Again acquired the Shah’s favour and was appointed to command the Eastern Division in August 1926. He is a pleasant and agreeable man, when he is not suffering from wind in the head, which is regrettably often. He is intelligent, fairly well-educated, is enthusiastic about sport, a fair polo and tennis player, and has done much to encourage sport in the Persian army. He likes amusement and European women, particularly Russians. He is of an easy-going temperament, lacking in determination of character and definiteness of opinion; but conciliatory, and does not fleece or oppress the people. Lacks judgment, and is prone to adopt new ideas and new machines without considering their suitability; but is gradually acquiring sense. He is inclined to imitate Westerners without discrimination. He is not unfriendly to Englishmen, but finds Frenchmen and Russians of the old regime more congenial. 1928. Organised and commanded the expedition for the pacification of Persian Baluchistan in the autumn of 1928. Created an i^mir Lashkar (General of Division) in November 1928 for his services.19 36. A mir Lashkar Mahmud Khan Airom. 1926. Comes of a family of immigrants from the Caucasus. He was born about 1880, the son of Sartip Mahmud Hussein Khan of the old regular Persian army. He ^'''Misted in the Cossack Division in 1895 and, through his father s influence, eventually received a commission in the Supply Department. There he happily spent his years of service until he was promoted sartip in 1919. He joined Reza Khan in the couip d’fitat, and was appointed to command the Southern Division with the rank or Amir Lashkar in 1922. His principal characteristic is an unquestioning devotion to Reza Shah. He takes no interest in politics, regards all Europeans alike and has no strong objection to any of them; will take an unlimited quantity of bribes, but does not go out of his way to extort them. On the other hand, he is too easy-going to check oppression by his subordinates. He has probably never heard of strategy, his tactics are limited to firing off his guns. He has retained his position principally by allowing his clever and energetic Chief of the Staff to do the work. 1928. Recalled from his command of the Southern Division in July 1928, which was divided up into separate units. 1929. Arrested and confined to his house in June as a result of the rebellion in Ears, where during his command of the Southern Division he was accused of peculation.

He attached himself to Reza Khan, whose influence with Starosselski secured his promotion to sarhang (colonel) in 1919. After Reza Khans coup d tjtat he was given command of the Ahan regiment of infantry; in 192o he was promoted sartip and given command of an infantry brigade in Tehran; and in 1926 he was sent to command the Western Division. He is almost entirely uneducated, is boorish in manner, has no conception of politics, has no relations with foreigners and is said to be fanatical. The Shah regards him as a stupid, but soundly practical, officer and a loyal follower. 1928. Recalled in the spring of 1928 for accepting too many bribes. Came to Tehran and managed to ingratiate himself with the Shah. Was appointed to command the Persian troops in Kurdistan shortly afterwards. 1929. Transferred to command the troops in Ears in December 1928; afterwards superseded by General Shaibani. 38. Mirza Yahya Khan (liimad-ed-Dowleh). 1928. Son of the late Baha-ul-Mulk Qaragozlu.

Owing to the sudden and unexpected death of Amid, the newly-appointed Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, he was appointed to succeed him in February 1929.

Is an agreeable and well-educated man. Speaks French fluently. He owes his new appointment entirely to the Minister of Court, with whom he is on terms of intimate friendship.

Dismissed in November 1929 for allowing publication in press of judicial safeguards accorded to foreigners in 1928. Reinstated in December 1929. 44. Hnssein Qnli Khan Nizam Qaragozlou (Amir Nizam). 1929. Born in 1883, eldest son of the late Amir Nizam. A member of the Qaragozlou family of Hamadan and a nephew of the late Regent, Nasr-ul-Mulk.

Rose from the ranks and served tor years as a brothei offitei of Shah 1 ahlavi. followed the fortunes of the latter, who, when he became Minister of War, used his influence to make Kerim Agha Director of the Tehran Municipality, which post he still holds as well as the portfolio of Minister of Public Works, to which he was appointed’in September 1929. He has given considerable personal attention to the modernising of Tehran, widening the streets by forcing the owners of houses and shops to pull down their antiquated properties and rebuild them on modern lines further back, and making over to the municipality at a very low price the amount of frontage necessary for street improvement. His methods have not been strictly legal, and a^first caused a considerable amount of discontent amongst property owners, but he has without doubt improved the aspect of the town, and, as the newly- constructed properties are bringing in to their owners considerably enhanced rents,the former discontent'has ^'.gradually given .way to a feeling of .satisfaction. High-handed methods were perhaps necessary to force the Tehranis to co-operate in the modernisation of their city, and Kerim Agha’s driving power has proved invaluable. He is, however, a man of no education, and his standard of intelligence is below that necessary for a Minister of Public Works. He caused the Railwju Syndicate so much trouble, even going so far as to refuse to pay the monek^^ instalments as they fell due, that the latter were compelled to give him an ultimatum threatening to close down if he persisted in being obstructive. This caused the Shah to invoke the help of Teymourtache, who was able to smooth matters over and satisfy the syndicate; consequently as Minister of Public Works he has not proved the success which he did as Director of the Municipality. Before he attained ministerial rank he was in charge of the Shah’s private properties, which he is said to have enlarged considerably at the expense of neighbouring estates and by methods which will not bear too close scrutiny.

As a result of the rebellion in bars in 1929 he was arrested and confined to his house on the accusation of peculation during the period of his divisional command. He was eventually made to refund a. large sum of money and dismissed from the army. While on service he had an unquestioning devotion to Reza Shah.

He was too easy-going to check oppression by his subordinate officers. His knowledge of strategy is non-existent, and his idea of tactics is limited to firing off his guns. He retained his command of the Southern Division chiefly by allowing his clever and energetic Chief of Staff to do the work. Speaks no foreign language. ALA, Mirza Hussein Khan, C.M.G.

This Cabinet abrogated the Treaty of Turkomanchai, and announced its intention of abolishing extra-territorial privileges. Mirza Hussein Khan was particularly hostile to Sir Charles Marling, His Majesty’s Minister to Persia from 1915 to 1918, and caused repeated complaints to be made to the Foreign Office through his brother, who was then Persian Minister in London.

This last Cabinet was reconstructed after one and a half months, and Ansari was omitted. He, however, was reappointed Foreign Minister in Vossuq’s Cabinet, formed on the 7th August, 1918. At the end of 1918 he was appointed president of the Persian mission to the Paris Peace Conference. This mission was abortive, and in 1919 Ansari was appointed Persian Ambassador to Turkey. In 1920 he was appointed as Ambassador to Moscow, and, with Taqi Zadeh, was instrumental in drawing up the Perso-Soviet Treaty of February 1921. Ansari remained in Moscow until July 1926, when he returned to Tehran to take up the appointment of Minister for Foreign Affairs. He returned to Moscow on a special mission in March 1927 in order to settle certain outstanding questions between Persia and the U.S.S.R., in which he was successful. Early in 1928 he visited Warsaw to finish negotia tions for a Ptrso-Polish commercial treaty, after which he visited Czechoslovakia and Germanv. In May 1928 he was again appointed Persian Ambassador to the U.S.S.R. Ansari talks Russian and French fluently, and is socially quite a pleasant and agreeable person. He is intelligent but lazy, untruthful, and carries little weight. He has a reputation amongst his compatriots for demagogy, lack of character, and for making money out of appointments to posts in the service under his direction. As Minister for Foreign Affairs he was most unsatisfactory and never tried to settle the smallest question. ASSAD, Jafer Quli Khan. Born about 1882. Eldest son of the late Serdar Assad Bakhtiari, who led the Bakhtiaris to the taking of Tehran in 1909, which culminated in the dethronement of Mohammad Ali Shah. A prominent leader of Bakhtiari irregular cavalry in 1911-12 in operations against rebellious tribesmen and partisans of the dethroned Shah, which operations he brought to a successful conclusion.

Is the most influential of the younger Bakhtiari Khans and resides in Tehran in order to look after Bakhtiari interests in the capital. Is in favour with Shah ^ Reza Pahlavi, who formerly served with him in various military operations. He has lost his former energy and has become indolent and conceited. As a Minister he is not a success, for he leaves the work of the War Ministry to the Chief of Staff as he left the work of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs to the Under secretary. Is friendly to His Majesty’s Government. Speaks no foreign language, but understands a little French. BUZURJMEHRI, General Kerim Agha. Born about 1878. Formerly a non-commissioned officer in the Cossack Brigade. Rose from the ranks and served for years as a brother officer of Reza Shah Pahlavi. He followed the fortunes of the latter, who, when he became Minister of War, used his influence to make Kerim Agha Director of the Tehran Municipality. In September 1929 Kerim Agha was made Minister of Public Works in addition to his directorship of the municipality, but in March 1930 the Ministry of Public Works was, divided up into the Ministries of Public Economy and of Roads and Communications and after that Kerim Agha retained only the municipality. He has given considerable personal attention to the modernising of Tehran, widening the streets by forcing the owners of houses and shops to pull down their antiquated buildings and reconstruct them on more modern lines after ceding to the municipality lor a mere song the amount of frontage necessary for enlarging the streets. His methods have not been strictly legal and at first caused a considerable amount of discontent amongst property owners, but he has without doubt improved the aspect of the capital and as the newly-constructed properties are bringing in to their owners considerably enhanced rents the former discontent has gradually died down. High-handed methods were perhaps necessary to force the Tehran is to co-operate in the improvement of the city and Kerim Agha's driving power has proved invaluable. He is a man of no education and his standard of intelligence is below that necessary for a ministerial post. He caused the Railway Syndicate so much trouble, even going so far as to refuse to pay the monetary instalments as they fell due, that the latter were compelled to give him an ulti matum threatening to close down if he persisted in being obstructive. This caused the Shah to invoke the help of Teymourtache, who was able to smoothe matters over and satisfy the syndicate. As Minister of Public Works he was certainly not the success that he was as Director of Municipality. Before he attained ministerial rank he had been in charge of the private estates of the Shah and is said to have enlarged them considerably at the expense of the owners of neighbouring estates and by methods which will not bear too close scrutiny He speaks no foreign language, but understands a little Russian BADGER, M irza Hussein Khan.

T S. « * ^ DASHTI, Sheikh Ali. Born about 1887. Educated in the schools of the Holy Places of Iraq. Returned to Persia about 1922 and edited a paper called the “ Shafaq Surkh.” As an editor he became notorious for slanderous abuse and the extortion of money by blackmail, and his abuse of Great Britain and British statesmen was frequently the subject of complaint from His Majesty’s Legation to the Persian ^Government. He was elected a Deputy to the fifth Majlis in 1924, but he was refused a seat by the Parliamentary Commission whose duty it was to scrutinise his election proceedings. He was prominent in the abortive Republican movement in 1924 and is said to have received and pocketed large sums from Reza Pahlavi, on whose behalf he w T orked. After acquiring a share of this world’s goods he appeared to become more human and ceased the abuse and vituperation for which he had become famous. He espoused the cause of Reza Pahlavi against Ahmed Shah and was elected a Deputy to the sixth Majlis in 1926. He was invited to Moscow in October 1927 to attend the tenth anniversary of the Soviet regime. From Moscow he went to Berlin and Paris and returned to Persia early in 1928.

He still edits his paper and receives subsidies in money or in paper, now from the Shah and now from the Soviet Embassy. He has put aside his turban for the Pahlavi hat and aspires to a ministerial post. He is a hot-headed firebrand with no scruples and no principles and is capable of the basest villainy if it will help him to attain his ends. He speaks no European language DAVER, Mirza Ali Akber Khan. Born about 1887. The son of a subordinate official in the private Treasury of Muzaffer ed-Din Shah. He was educated in Tehran.

Elected to the Constituent Assembly in December 1925, e was chosen by the members of that Assembly to revise the constitutional law 7 in a way which would permit of the accession of Reza Pahlavi as Shah.

He was appointed Minister of Public Works from December 1925 to June 1926 when he took his seat in the Majlis. He w 7 as appointed Minister of Justice in February 1927 and displayed feverish energy in sweeping away the old judicial courts and paving the way for the Shah's proclamation in April of the impending abolition of the capitulations. Daver is a studious, intelligent and well-read man, in addition to being a capable lawyer. He founded a Radical party in Persia which attracted many adherents but which subsequently died away. He has w T orked unremittingly at the modernisation of the judiciary and has succeeded extremely well. He is a pleasant man to meet socially although he frequents European society rarely, being entirely taken up with his work. He is not entirely free from demagogy and untruthfulness.

Neither as Minister for Foreign Affairs nor as Minister of Finance did he show the smallest initiative, but merely carried out the orders of the Minister of Court; in fact he has no initiative nor does he carry any weight and has probably little lust for work. As Minister for Foreign Affairs he appeared in the role of a polite obstructionist. Seems to lack energy both of mind and body. He speaks French and German. FATEMI, Mirza Sayyid Mehdi Khan. Born about 1888.

On the 12th June he was released from the State prison nominally for reasons of health and permitted to finish the period of imprisonment in his ovm house. Firuz Mirza was generally reckoned as one of the most intelligent and able of the young Persians and was a very clever politician; he is, however, extremely unscrupulous and is hated by most of his compatriots. Although he made his peace with this Legation in 1923 he rarely missed an opportunity of creating annoyances for Great Britain and there w 7 as little room for confidence in him; in fact he seems to possess all the qualities that are bad and there is hardly a thing to he said in his favour. His condemnation to the loss of civil rights is likely to remove him from politics for a time if not for ever, but even should he come back it is difficult to believe that he will play so important a role as in the past. Speaks French fluently and a little English. GHAFFARI, Hassan Ali Khan. Born about 1890, son of the late Moavin-ed-Dowleh, a former Minister for Foreign Affairs. Educated in Europe.

Appointed Persian Minister to Washington in 1926, and remained there until April 1930, wdien he w T as recalled, ow in ( T to some trouble with the personnel of the legation. He has much charm of manner, but lacks force of character. After years of servme abroad, he finds i^ difficult to accommodate himself to life in Persia. Speaks English and French fluently. MUDARRIS, Sayyid Hassan. Born about 1870, a native of the Province of Isfahan. He started his career as a religious teacher and dabbled in politics for years before entering Parliament as a member for Isfahan in 1914. He was a leading member of the Provisional Government set up by the Muhajerin or pro-German exiles at Kermanshah in 1915 and went to Constantinople, only returning to Persia early in 1918. He took refuge in the mosque at Shah Abdul Azim, near Tehran, as a protest against the Cabinet of Nejef Quli Khan Bakhtiari in the summer of 1918, and worked hard to bring in the Cabinet of Mirza Hassan Khan Vossuq in the summer of that year. He later quarrelled with Vossuq over the Anglo-Persian Convention, thereby gaining much renown and popularity. Was a prominent Deputy in the fourth', fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis, but was not allowed to be elected a Deputy to the seventh term when the elections were strictly controlled by the Government. He was exiled to Khorasan in October 1928 and has never been allowed to come back to Tehran. He was responsible more than any other individual in bringing about the failure of the Republican movement in'1924. He leads a very simple life and is much revered by the lower classes, who used to frequent his house and ask his advice on all sorts of questions. He is quite fearless and frank and expresses his [5090] c10 opinions freely, and nobody, not even the Shah, escaped his criticisms. An apparently organised attempt to assassinate him was made in October 1926 one morning in the street, but, although wounded in three places, he managed to escape with his life. For an old-fashioned cleric, he is cute and far-sighted, but is a demagogue and obstinate. Speaks no European language. MUHSIN, Suleiman Mirza. Born about 1875. An obscure Qajar Prince, probably descended from the / ~ s numerous progeny of Path Ali Shah. In the early years of the Persian Constitution he was one of the leaders of the Democrat party. Elected a Deputy to the third Majlis, and left Tehran with the pro-German clique in 1915 for Bagdad and Constantinople. On the capture by the British forces of Bagdad, Suleiman Mirza took refuge with the Sinjabi tribe on the Perso-Iraq frontier, whence he conducted a system of espionage against the British army. On the Sinjabis refusing to surrender him, they were attacked in 1918 and Suleiman Mirza was captured and sent to India. He returned to Persia in 1921 and was again elected to the Majlis, where he led a small Socialist group. Was again elected to the fifth term of the Majlis and was leader of the minority party. Appointed Minister of Education in 1923, but did nothing beyond filling the posts of that Ministry with his Socialist friends. Since the establishment of a Soviet representation in this country Suleiman Mirza has been on terms of close friendship with the Soviets, but he has lost any popularity he ever had and his Socialist party has broken down badly. In October 1927 he went to Moscow to be present at the tenth anniversary of the Soviet regime, and afterwards he visited Berlin and Paris, returning to Persia in the winter of 1920. He is a demagogue and time-serving politician, for whom modern Persia has little use. Speaks no European language MUSHAR, Mirza Hassan Khan. Born about 1874. Started his career in the Ministry of Finance and rose to be an accountant. Appointed Minister of Finance in 1916, and again in 1918 in the Cabinet of Mirza Hassan Khan \ossuq, subsequently exchanging that post for that of Minister without portfolio until June 1920. Appointed Minister of Court by Sayyid Zia-ed-Din in 1921. Elected a Deputy to the fourth term of the Majlis in 1921, but, being suspected of plotting against Reza Khan Pahlavi, then Minister of War, he was obliged to resign and go to Europe. He returned to Persia in 1924, his innocence having been meanwhile established. Appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in August 1924 and resigned in December 1925. Appointed Minister of Finance in November 1929, but resigned in April 1930, having found that the interference of the Minister of Court in financial administration rendered his position untenable. He is a man of common sense and intelligence. As Minister for Foreign Affairs, he showed himself very friendly to His Majesty’s Legation and used his best endeavours for the settlement of outstanding questions. He is not popular with many of his compatriots in high places owing to his straightforward character and outspokenness. Speaks no foreign language. MUSSADIQ, Dr. Muhammad Khan. Born about 1885. Is a nephew of Farman Farmayan. Has studied law in Paris to a certain extent and poses as a jurist. Appointed Governor-General of tars in 1920 Appointed Minister of Justice for four months in July 1920. Appointed Minister of Finance in .June 1921 and sought and obtained authority from Parliament to purge and reform that Ministry. However, during his six months’ tenure of that portfolio he destroyed indiscriminately the good with the bad, and at the end the organisation was worse than before, as he proved himself entirely incapable of making reforms. Appointed Governor-General of Azerbaijan in 1922, and in 1923 became Minister for Foreign Affairs for a period of four months. Elected as a Deputy to the fourth, fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis from Tehran. Owing to his opposition to the Government in the sixth term, steps were taken to prevent him from being elected to later terms of the Majlis. He is a demagogue and a windbag. Speaks French fluently.MUSSAYED, Hovhannes Khan. A Persian Armenian, born about 1864. Entered the Ministry for Foreign Affairs very early. Was attached to the Persian missions which attended both Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria. Was confidential secretary to the late Nasr-ul-Mulk when the latter was Prime Minister and Regent during the minority of Ahmed Shah. Sent to Berlin in 1910 as Charge d’Affaires, subse quently becoming Persian Minister there. In 1916 he was recalled at the instance of the German Government, which accused him of pro-British sentiments. He remained until 1925 in London and Paris, and only then returned to Persia. Elected as one of the two Armenian Deputies to the Majlis in 1926. Appointed to be Persian Minister in London in July 1927 and remained at the post until dune 1929. In 1930 he was appointed Persian Minister to Japan and left in April to take up his appointment. Hovhannes Khan is a well-read man and somewhat of a litteraire. He has translated many of Shakespeare’s works into Armenian and has a great wish to complete that work. He is greatly respected by his compatriots, and is the only Armenian who has represented Persia abroad in recent years. Talks English and French fluently. MUSTAUFI, Mirza Hassan Khan. Born about 1870; formerly known as Mustaufi-el-Mamalek. His father, Mustaufi-el-Mamalek. was a former Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, who died in 1882, leaving large estates and a considerable fortune. Mirza Hassan Khan went to Europe in 1900 and stayed there seven years, during which period he squandered most of the wealth he had inherited. When he returned to Persia in 1907 he was appointed Paymaster-General of the Army. He was elected a Deputy to the Majlis in 1908, and became in 1909 Minister of War and subsequently Minister of Finance. In 1910 he became Prime Minister, but resigned the following year. In 1913 he again became Minister of War, and in 1914 again Prime Minister. Resigning in March 1915, he was again called upon in August and was Prime Minister and Minister of Interior until December 1915. From June-December 1917 he was a Minister without portfolio, and from January-April 1918 he was Prime Minister. In July 1920 he was again a Minister without portfolio until November 1920. He held no post until February 1923, when he again became Prime Minister until June of the same year. In June 1926 he was again Prime Minister until May 1927, when he resigned. He was elected a Deputy for Tehran in the seventh term of the Majlis (October 1928), but he refused to accept. He is a typical old-time Persian gentleman, fond of hawking and hunting, but he is a man of weak character and incapable of taking a decision on the most unimportant matter. He is universally liked but has no qualities of administra tion or organisation. He has entirely squandered the fortune he inherited. His lack of decision was very noticeable during his premiership in 1915, when he weakly allowed the pro-German party a free rein. He acquired thereby a reputation for unfriendliness towards the Allies, but it may be stated that he was not unfriendly but simply lacking in energy. His character remains the same. He understands and speaks a little French. NIZAM QARAGOZLU, Hussein Quli Khan. Born in 1883, the eldest son of the late Amir Nizam. A member of the Qaragozlu family of Hamadan and a nephew of the late Regent, Nasr-ul-Mulk. Educated in England and Austria, Passed through the Military Academy at Vienna and served with a commission in an Austrian infantry regiment for three years. Inherited large estates from his father in the district of Hamadan, but owing to his absence in Europe from 1921 to 1929, these estates have been allowed to deteriorate. Was appointed Governor of Kermanshah by Vossuq in 1919, where he was very popular on account of his honesty and integrity. Being a rich man he was imprisoned at the time of the coup d'Etat in 1921 and made to pay 20,000 tomans as the price of his release. He was so disgusted at this unmerited treatment that he left Persia and vowed never to return. During his stay in Europe he lost heavily at Monte Carlo and Deauville. Teymourtache met him in Europe in 1928 and persuaded him to return to Persia, which he did the following year. Appointed Grand Master of Ceremonies at the Court in March [5090] d1929. Sent to Europe on private business for the Shah in March 1930 and returned at the end of December. An extremely agreeable and likeable man with more than a veneer of European culture. Is the best type of educated young Persian and is noted for his honesty and integrity. Speaks fluently French, German and English. PAKRAVAN, Mirza Fathullah Khan. Born about 1885. First became known as a member of the second Majlis, where it appears that he was the laughing-stock of his colleagues. In 1910 he obtained the appointment of Persian consul-general in Constantinople although he had had no previous career in any Government Department. From Con stantinople he went to Egypt as consul-general and later became Persian Minister there until he returned to Tehran early in 1925. In 1925 he was appointed Director of the Russian and Turkish Section in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Soviet Embassy objected to this appointment at first on the score that Pakravan, having been many years in Egypt, was probably a British agent. Finally, the Soviet Embassy withdrew its objection and Pakravan became 'persona grata with the Russians so much that when Ansari became Minister for Foreign Affairs in July 1926 the Soviet Embassy asked that Pakravan be appointed Under-Secretary. He duly received this appointment and was in charge of the Ministry during Ansar is absence in Moscow until he was appointed Persian Minister in Rome in December 1928. When he assumed charge of the Foreign Ministry the first impression he conveyed was that of an agreeable and conscientious young man, but closer contact proved him to be a garrulous nonentity. Teymourtache exercised a close super vision over matters relating to the Foreign Ministry and it was evident that Pakravan carried no weight and was but a figurehead. Teymourtache was at no pains to hide the fact that he considered Pakravan merely an amiable fool. Interviews with him were mere waste of time, and during the twenty months that he was in charge of the Ministry affairs remained at a standstill. Speaks French fluently. PAHLAVI, Reza Shah. Born about 1873. Comes of a small family from Sawad Kuh, in Mazanderan. His father was a Persian and his mother of Caucasian stock, whose parents sought refuge in Persia when certain Caucasian districts were ceded to Russia by the Treaty of Turkomanchai. Fie entered the Persian Cossack Brigade at the age of 15 and was employed as a stable boy. He rose from the ranks and gained the approval of the Russian instructors of the brigade for his courage and fearlessness, and whenever an expedition was sent to any part of the country to round up brigands or quell a disturbance, he seems to have taken part in it. At the beginning of the war he had been promoted colonel and in 1921, when the Cossack Brigade, previously transformed into a division, was deprived of its Russian officers and was being reformed after a severe defeat at the hands of the Bolshevik forces in North Persia, was in need of a resolute leader, the choice fell on Reza Khan. In March 1921 he marched at its head towards Tehran, which he took with the greatest ease, installing Sayyid Zia-ed-Din as Premier, keeping the command of the army himself. Thereafter, his rise to power was rapid. Six weeks later he became Minister of War and held that office until the 31st October, 1925, becoming Prime Minister as well from October 1923 onwards. On the 31st October, 1925, the Majlis deposed Sultan Ahmed Shah and entrusted the provisional direction of the country to Reza Khan Pahlavi. On the 16th December, 1925, in consequence of the decision of the Constituent Assembly, Reza Khan succeeded to the Throne of Persia with the title of Reza Khan Pahlavi. He was crowned in April 1926. He is an entirely self-educated man with a natural dignity. He has a strong character and has a great deal of ability and energy. Full of ambition, he has set out to extricate Persia from disintegration and from the morass of inefficiency into which it had fallen, and to raise it to a position of real independence. In spite of tremendous difficulties, he has already succeeded to a large extent. He may succeed entirely if he lives long enough, but he has not succeeded in changing the national character of sloth and idleness, and it is therefore doubtful if. after his demise, the work will be carried on. He is not popular but is feared, and this in an oriental country is the more advantageous.13 [5090] d 2 He is insincere, in the sense that he regards prevarication and duplicity as fair weapons; he is thoroughly suspicious of anybody whom he suspects of being cleverer than himself, and he does not hesitate to put into retirement any army commander who has shown himself too successful in the field. He cannot be said to have endeared himself to any of his sub jects nor to have attracted them to himself in such a way that he could count on their fidelity in any awkward situation. Since the beginning of 1930 the Minister of Court has made access to the Royal presence more and more difficult, with the result that the Shah is much less in contact with public opinion than formerly. Reza Shah is avaricious and greedy of wealth, and all means whereby he can acquire money and lands are good to him. He indulges in opium and native, spirits and has become stouter and more bloated since becoming Shah than he was when he led the active life of an army commander. Whilst feared by his subjects by reason of his rough tongue and his rougher methods of treatment, he himself is not without fear, and it is said that he never goes to bed without having within reach several weapons and that he frequently starts up from his sleep to grasp one of them. He is without pity towards all whom he suspects of plotting against him, and mere suspicion is often enough to condemn them to lifelong prison, if not to death. Finally, it may be said that his great skill in dealing with his own compatriots has its counterpart in a sublime ignorance of foreign mentality. Beyond once returning from Khuzistan to Tehran via Bagdad, he has never been outside Persia. He speaks a little Russian, learnt during his service under Russian officers of the Persian Cossack Brigade. PIRNIA, Mirza Hassan Khan, G.C.M.G. Born about 1872, the eldest son of the late Mushir-ed-Dowleh, who was Foreign Minister for many years and died in 1907. Educated in Russia. Appointed Persian Minister to the Court of Russia in 1902. He joined the Constitutional party in 1906 and was one of the Progressives who were instru mental in obtaining the signature of Muzaffer-ed-Din Shah to the Constitution. He translated from the French and Russian many laws on which the Persian Constitution was based. In 1907 he was sent to London as Special Envoy to announce the accession to the Throne of Persia of Muhammad Ali Shah and w r as created G.C.M.G. Appointed Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs for a few r months at the end of 1907 and again at the beginning of 1908, and Minister of Justice from July 1908 to January 1909. He has also at various times been Minister of War. He became Prime Minister in March 1915 for a month, in 1920 for four months, in 1922 for six months and in 1923 for five months. Hb and his brother, Hussein Khan Pirnia, have generally been the two most favoured candidates from Tehran for the Majlis, but thev refused to take their seats in the seventh term of the Majlis as, in their opinion, the elections had not been freely held. Mirza Hassan Khan Pirnia is a very intelligent man with a good reputation for honesty among his compatriots, but he is very timorous and has always preferred to resign office rather than face a crisis. He inherited large estates from his father and is very wealthy. He speaks French and Russian fluently. PIRNIA, Mirza Hussein Khan. Born about 1875, the second son of the late Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Educated in France. After finishing his studies he returned to Persia in 1902, and became secretary to his father, who was then Minister for Foreign Affairs. Received his first Cabinet appointment in 1918 as Minister of Education. Was appointed a Minister without fortfolio in 1920. He has generally preferred a parliamentary to a ministerial career, and was elected to every term of the Majlis since its inception until the seventh term. To that term, also, he was elected, but refused to take his seat, as he did not consider the elections to have been held freely. He was chosen as president for the whole terms of the third and fourth Parliaments and for the greater part of the fifth term and for half of the sixth term, and he showed himself to be firm and impartial.14 He is an intelligent man, of firm character, but of a modest and ictiring ^ disposition. He is studious and well-read. He talks French and English fluently. QARAGOZLU. Mirza Yahya Khan. Born about 1890, son of the late Beha-ul-Mulk Qaragozlu. Educated in France, where he spent many years. Was once an Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Interior. Appointed in 1927 a counsellor in the Court of Appeal, under the reorganised judiciary. In January 1928 appointed Minister of Public Instruction, but has shown little aptitude in the affairs of his Ministry to judge from the press attacks on the educational system. Qaragozlu is very friendly with Teymourtache and Firuz Mirza, and it was by reason of that friendship that he was appointed Minister of Education. Is a landowmer in the Hamadan district and is well off. He has a reputation for honesty and is conceited. Chosen as special Persian representative at the Persian National Art Exhibition to be held in London in January 1931 and left Tehran for London in December 1930. Speaks French fluently. RAHNEMA, Mirza Zein-ul-Abedin Khan. Born about 1888, one of the sons of the late Sheikh-ul-Araquein, a Persian subject and small Mujtehid of Kerbela. Rahnema was educated in Iraq and came to Persia about 1910. He was a member of the Democratic party and edited first the newspaper “ Rahnema ' ’ and subsequently the semi-official paper “Iran.” He was elected a Deputy to the fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis. Was sent to Europe in 1923 on a mission to “boom ” Persia, and stayed most of the time in Paris. Was appointed Under secretary to the Ministry of Public Works at the end of 1926 and Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Interior in April 1927. In June 1927 he became assistant to the Prime Minister, but was dismissed in January 1928 and fell from favour. From that time he has confined himself to journalism and accompanied the Shah on his journey to Khuzistan in October 1928 as press representative. He appears to have worked his way back to favour, and his paper is regarded as the Government organ. Rahnema is an ambitious young man, with plenty of “push.” His great ambition has always been to obtain a Government post, which he hoped would culminate in a ministerial appointment. With that object in view, he discarded his turban and gave up his title of “ sheikh.” This brought him three different Under-Secretaryships in succession. He is intelligent and clever in a certain sense. As a journalist he has always been fairly scrupulous, and took no part in the campaign of blackmail in -which most of his journalist colleagues indulged in the years 1921-25. Speaks a little French. SAMIYI, Mirza Hussein Khan. Born about 1878, a native of Resht. Has spent his early career in the Ministry of Interior and was once Governor of Resht. Appointed Minister of Public Works 1921 to June 1922. In March 1923 he became Minister of Interior for three months. When the present Shah became Prime Minister in October 1923, Samiyi was chosen as his assistant, until, in August 1924, he was appointed Minister of Justice. Early in 1926 he was appointed Governor of Tehran and held that post until he was appointed Minister of Interior in June 1927. Samiyi is a pleasant man, but of little influence. He is not very energetic nor highly intelligent. He speaks no foreign language. SHAHBAKHTI, General Muhammad Khan. Born about 1882, the son of a peasant inhabiting the village of Ishtihar, near Tehran. He enlisted in the Cossack Brigade about 1901, distinguished himself by bravery in the field, and received a commission. In 1914 he was a captain. He15 &amp; attached himself to Reza Khan, whose influence with General Starosselsky secured him promotion to the rank of colonel in 1919. After the coup d'Etat of 1921 he was appointed to command the Ahan regiment of infantry. In 1925 he was promoted general and given command of an infantry brigade in Tehran. In 1926 he was sent to command the Western Division, but was recalled in the spring of 1928 for corruption; he, however, managed to ingratiate himself with the Shah, and was appointed shortly afterwards to command the Persian troops ^)in Kurdistan. In December 1928 he was sent to command the troops in Fars, but was superseded by General Shaibani. Shahbakhti is almost entirely uneducated and boorish in manner. He eschews politics, has no relations wdth foreigners, and is reputed to be fanatical. The Shah regards him as a stupid but practical officer and a loyal follower. Understands a little Russian, a relic of the days when he served in the Cossack Brigade under Russian officers. SHAIBANI, General Habibullah Khan. Born about 1885, the son of Nazm-ed-Dowleh, who came of a middle-class family of Kashan. In 1906 Shaibani went to St. Cyr, where he graduated in 1910 and joined a French regiment. Returned to Persia in 1913, and was commissioned into the Swedish-officered gendarmerie as a captain. He was highly regarded by the Swedish officers, and was promoted major in 1914. He was strongly anti- Russian, and consequently anti-Ally, during the war, and he joined the Muhajerin (the pro-German party), and remained in Turkey until 1918, when he returned to Tehran and re-enterea the gendarmerie. He appears to have made contact with Reza Khan about 1920, and was working in his interests before the coup d'Etat. Promoted colonel in 1921, he served in the operations against the Jangalis and against Simitko. Promoted General of Brigade in 1922, and in 1923 went to France in charge of Persian military students. He entered the French Staff College and graduated with distinction in 1925. He attended the Arms Traffic Conference at the League as Persian representative in the autumn of 1925, and was very sore at the success of the British representative in getting the Persian Gulf included in the Maritime Zone. In 1926 he was appointed acting Chief of the General Staff. He resigned that appointment in March 1928 owing to his disagreement with certain orders issued by the Shah. Appointed Minister of Public Workjs in May 1928 until December, when he lost that appoint ment and was placed en disponibilite. Appointed a member of the High Military Council in January 1929. Promoted General of Division in June 1929, he was' sent to command the army in Fars to deal with the rebellion in that province. He was successful in restoring order, as the Qashgai, although in a fighting mood, were short of munitions. In 1930 he commanded the operations in the Mamasenni district and against the Kuhgeluis, and by October he had succeeded in reducing the Kuhgeluis, only one of their khans still refusing to make his submission to the Government. Shaibani is a man of independent views, and is somewhat rigid and narrow minded. He is a strict disciplinarian, and does not play to the gallery. His military ideas are conservative and sound, and he is perhaps the only French- trained officer who has not been led away from the realisation of realities. He regards Russia as the enemy of Persia; of the motives underlying British policy he has a fair understanding, and he thinks that Britain cap and should help Persia in her own interests, but he believes that Britain will always sacrifice Persia if it should be in her interest to do so. He is intensely patriotic, and will stoutly oppose whatever he considers to be derogatory to Persian sovereignty or detrimental to Persian independence. At the same time he views with disfavour Persia’s hasty efforts to play the role of a civilised nation. He is remarkably honest, direct in speech, and prompt in action. He has little sympathy with Persian officialdom. His nickname in the army is “ Feranghi,” not by reason of any imitation of Europeans, but rather because of the un-Persian nature of his character. He speaks French fluently. TADAYUN. Sayyid Muhammad. Born about 1884, a native of Birjand in East Persia; educated in Tehran, where he graduated and became a schoolmaster. After the split up of the16 original Democrat party in 1912, Tadayun became the leader of one of the more* important Democrat factions. He was elected a Deputy from Tehran to the fourth term of the Majlis, and from Birjand to the fifth and sixth terms. Was elected president of the Majlis in the second half of the fifth term and again at the beginning of the sixth term. In February 1927 he was appointed Minister of Education, but in December he resigned that appointment owing to disagree ment with his colleagues in the Cabinet, but he resumed office nine days later at the personal request of the Shah. On the 7th January, 1928, the 8&gt;hah ordered him to resign, and his fall was said to be due to the personal animosity towards him of Teymourtache, who even vetoed his candidature as a Deputy to the seventh term of the Majlis. In June 1930 he was appointed Governor of Kerman, and appears to have recovered the Royal favour to a certain extent. Tadayun was one of the principal supporters of the Republican movement in 1924, and is said to have appropriated to himself a large part of the funds put at his disposal for the realisation of that object. As president of the Majlis he was a success, being impartial and strict in upholding the rules of the House. He is undoubtedlv an intelligent man and has a very pleasant manner. He knows a little French. TAQIZADEH, Sayyid Hassan. Born in Tabriz about 1880, the son of a small preacher. He was educated in his native town and used to haunt the booksellers' shops, where he showed great eagerness to acquire knowledge. In his early youth he was an ardent Nationalist, and was connected with the Nationalist movement in Persia from the beginning. He was elected to the first term of the Majlis and was one of its most prominent members. Mohammad Ali Shah hated and feared him, and when the Shah made a coup d'Etat in 1908 against the Majlis, Taqizadeh took refuge in His Majesty’^ Legation. The demand made by the Shah that he should be given up was refused, and Taqizadeh was eventually amnestied, on the condition that he went to Europe. He visited London and Cambridge, but returned to Tabriz at the end of 1908. He was elected to the second term of the Majlis in 1909, and after the caoture of Tehran by the Nationalist forces and the abdication of Mohammad Ali Shah in July 1909, Taqizadeh became a prominent member of the Nationalist Committee, which was set up to decide on the Government of the country. Went to Europe in 1910. He was elected in his absence to the third and fourth terms of the Majlis, but did not take his seat. He stayed in Europe and America during the whole of the period from 1914 to 1923, and was for years in Berlin, where he edited a paper called “Kaveh.” For publishing certain articles of an anti-Islamic nature, he was excommunicated by the mujtahids. lie negotiated the Perso-Soviet Commercial Treaty in Moscow in February 1921. and finally returned to Persia in 1924. He was elected to the fifth term of the Majlis 1924-26, and to the sixth term in 1926. He visited America again in 1926 as Persian delegate to the Philadelphia Exhibition. Appointed Governor-General of Khorasan in January 1929; he was recalled in May and appointed Persian Minister in London, where he remained until April 1930, when he returned to Persia and became Minister of Roads and Communications. In August 1930 he was apoointed Minister of Finance, in addition. Taqizadeh is a well-read man and has travelled extensively. He is no longer so notably ponular as he was in the early days of the Constitution, and the years have tempered his excessive energy and zeal. His speeches in the Majlis mark him as a man of common sense and moderation, and are in sharp contrast to the utterances of the former fiery young Nationalist. He may well prefer the life of a Deputy to that of a Minister, and he has wrought no miracles since he attained Cabinet rank. He is married to a German and talks German fluently. He speaks English and French less well. f TEYMOURTACHE, Mirza Abdul Hussein Khan. Born about 1888 of a Khorasan family. Educated in Russia. Elected a Deputy to the third, fourth, fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis. He did not take his seat in the sixth term as he was appointed Minister of Court to Reza Shah Pahlavi before the sixth term opened.' He was elected also to the seventh term! 7 and accepted, but did not sit. Was Persian member of the Mixed Financial Commission 1916-17. Appointed Governor of Gilan in 1919 and remained there for one year. Minister of Justice, January to June 1922. Governor of Kerman, September 1923 to April 1924. Minister of Public Works from August 1924 to .December 1925. After the accession to the Throne of Reza Shah on the 16th December, 1925, Teymourtache took over the duties of Minister of Court. In the summer of 1926 he went on an official mission to Moscow, to try and arrange the terms of a commercial and trading agreement with the Soviet, but was not successful. Visited Germany, Switzerland and France before returning to Persia in December 1926. In the Majlis he showed himself to be a good orator, and as a Minister in the Cabinet he was generally chosen to answer for the Government before the Majlis. Quick-witted and energetic, he has pleasant manners, and is socially agreeable. He is of a light-hearted disposition, witty, but often too flippant; however, a sense of responsibility appears to add sometimes a semblance of gravity to a character which is essentially fickle. He is, moreover, a confirmed gambler, and is not sparing in the use of alcoholic drink. In addition, he works extremely hard, and has been more than once on the verge of a breakdown. He visited Europe in the summer of 1928, and was received by King George V in London. He was also entertained in Paris, Rome, Berlin and Brussels, and returned to Persia in September, when the Shah granted to him the title of “ Highness.” As Minister of Court he has acquired the position of the Shah’s most intimate political adviser. His influence is ubiquitous and his pow r er exceeds that of the Prime Minister. He attends all meetings of the Cabinet and his position may be compared to that of Reich Chancellor except that he has no direct responsibility. He is an ardent nationalist and was responsible for the denunciation of the special treaties which governed the regime of consular jurisdiction. His influence over the Shah appears to he as strong as ever and he has succeeded in encircling His Majesty, only allowing those of whom he is sure to approach him alone. With his compatriots he has become most unpopular as he is known to be responsible for the absurd restrictions on monetary exchange which, since their inception in the spring of 1930, have slowly paralysed all commercial affairs, and which wdll lead to an economic disaster if persisted in. The condemnation of his friend, Prince Firuz, in the spring of 1930 for corruption and his inability to help him, appeared to weaken his position for a moment, but if it did so he quickly recovered. As regards his integrity, many rumours accuse him of feathering his nest, but if such rumours are true Teymourtache is too clever not to cover up the traces of his transactions. Speaks French and Russian fluently and understands English. VOSSUQ. Mirza Hassan Khan, G.C.B. Born about 1868. Began his career in the Ministry of Finance.

Elected as a Deputy from Tehran to the seventh term of the Majlis, 1928-1930. A man of great ability and character He became unpopular over the Anglo-Persian Convention, but after a most able and convincing defence of his acts as Prime Minister during the period 1918-1920 before the Majlis, he regained a large measure of popularity. Still has some bitter enemies who seem to have prevented him from acquiring the favour of the Shah. His name has been frequently mentioned for diplomatic appointments abroad, but he seems to prefer to live quietly in Tehran. Speaks French fluently, also a little English.VOSSUQ, Mirza Ahmed Klian. A brother of Mirza Hassan Khan, Vossuq, than whom he is younger by a few years. Began his career in the Ministry of Finance. Became Minister of War July to October 1910 and Minister of Interior July to November 1911 and again in December 1911. Minister of Finance July to August 1914, and Minister of Interior November 1917 to January 1918.

Banished to Europe in October 1923, being accused of having plotted against the life of Reza Khan, now Reza Shah. Was allowed to return to Tehran at the end of 1929 and arrived in March 1930, when he went to reside quietly on his property at Lahijan, near Resht. A clever man, but sly, intriguing and unreliable. Has generally been friendly to His Majesty’s Legation. Speaks a little French. YEZDAN PENAH, General Murteza Khan. Born about 1891, son of Mirza Ali Akbar, a small shopkeeper in the village of Serdasht. In 1907, Murteza Khan entered the Cossack Cadet School. Received his commission in 1912, showed strong pro-Russian sympathies and consequently gained rapid promotion. Made lieutenant-colonel in 1919 and colonel in 1920. During the whole of his service he was intimate with Reza Khan and accompanied him on the march to Tehran in February 1921 which culminated in the coup d'Etat. Was promoted general and given the command of the Central Division. In July 1927 he fell from favour and was put under arrest for a short time for an unknown reason. Whatever the suspicions against him were, they appear to have been unsubstantiated for he was released very soon. In the autumn of 1928, he was appointed inspector of the army, and in the following year he was placed in command of the gendarmerie, but was superseded in 1930 and left without any active command. Murteza Khan was always regarded until 1927 as a very loyal supporter of Reza Shah, but since his arrest in 1927 for no apparent reason he appears to have lost confidence in the Shah. He is active, intelligent, ambitious and a strict disciplinarian. His military ideas and his general education are very limited, but he has shown anxiety to learn. He is not popular amongst the troops but is feared and respected. Holds aloof from foreigners and is a strong ooponent of foreign interference in Persia. In the event of anything happening to Reza Shah Murteza Khan might again come to the fore.

He was eventually made to refund a large sum of money and dismissed from the army. While on service he had an ui'njuestioning devotion to Reza Shah. He took no interest in politics and regarded all Europeans alike, having no strong objection to any of them. He was always willing to accept bribes, but did not extort them. He was too easy-going to check oppression by his subordinate officers. His knowledge of strategy is non-existent, and his idea of tactics is limited to firing off his guns. He retained his command of the Southern Division chiefly by allowing his clever and energetic Chief of Staff to do the work. Speaks no foreign language. 2. Airom, General Muhammad Hussein Khan. Aged about 50. Of Caucasian extraction, and related to Amir Lashkar Mahmud Khan Airom. Educated partly in a military school at Tiflis.

This Cabinet abrogated the Treaty of Turkomanchai, and announced its intention of abolishing extra-territorial privileges. Mirza Hussein Khan was particularly hostile to Sir Charles Marling His Majesty s Minister to Persia from 1915 to 1918, and caused repeated complaints to be made to the Foreign Office through his brother, who was then Persian Minister m London. He accompanied the abortive Persian mission to the Paris leace Conference in 1918. Appointed Persian Minister at Madrid in 1919 and at \\ ashmgton in 1920.

He is particularly spiteful to people that he does not like - He was on intimate terms with the Millspaugh Financial Mission, but his influence with Dr. Millspaugh was not advantageous to the latter. He is held in high esteem by Teymourtaehe, the Minister of Court, and may well become Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs at some future time. He speaks English and French fluently. 4.

He is determined and intelligent, though not well educated. He is tyrannical, but socially quite agreeable. He accepts no master but the Shah.

In January 1918 he again became Minister for Foreign Affairs in Mustaufi’s Cabinet, and retained that portfolio in the following Cabinet formed by Nejef Quli Khan Bakhtiari in May 1918. This last Cabinet was reconstructed after one and a half months, and Ansari was omitted. He, however, was reappointed Foreign Minister in Vossuq's Cabinet, formed on the 7th August, 1918. At the end of 1918 he was appointed president of the Persian mission to the Paris Peace Conference. This mission was abortive, and in 1919 Ansari was appointed Persian Ambassador to Turkey. In 1920 he was appointed as Ambassador to Moscow, and, with Taqi Zadeh, was instrumental in drawing up the Perso-Soviet Treaty of February 1921. Ansari remained in Moscow until July 1926, when he returned to Tehran to take up the appointment of Minister for Foreign Affairs. He returned to Moscow on a special mission in March 1927 in order to settle certain outstanding questions between Persia and the U.S.S.R., in which he was successful. Early in 1928 he visited Warsaw to finish negotia tions for a Perso-Polish commercial treaty, after w r hich he visited Czechoslovakia and Germany. In May 1928 he was again appointed Persian Ambassador to the U.S.S.R.4 Ansari talks Russian and French fluently, und is socially quite a pleasant and agreeable person. He is intelligent but lazy, untruthful, and carries little weight. He has a reputation amongst his compatriots for demagogy, lack of character, and for making money out of appointments to posts in the service under his direction. As Minister for Foreign Affairs he was most unsatisfactory and never tried to settle the smallest question. Appointed Persian Minister in London in May 1931. 7. Assad, Jafer Quli Khan. Born about 1882. Eldest son of the late Serdar Assad Bakhtiari, who led the Bakhtiaris to the taking of Tehran in 1909, which culminated in the dethronement of Mohammad Ali Shan. A prominent leader of Bakhtiari irregular cavalry in 1911-12 in operations against rebellious tribesmen and partisans of the dethroned Shah, which operations he brought to a successful conclusion. Was Ilbeggi of the Bakhtiari tribe in 1914. Governor of Sultanabad in 1917, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs January to April 1918. Governor-General of Kerman 1919-20. Governor-General of Khorasan 1923. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs August 1924 to June 1926. Minister of War June 1927. Visited Europe, including England, in the summer of 1927 on account of his wife’s health and returned to Tehran in December 1927. Is the most influential of the younger Bakhtiari Khans and resides in Tehran in order to look after Bakhtiari interests in the capital. Is in favour with Shah Reza Pahlavi, who formerly served with him in various military operations. He has lost his former energy and has become indolent and conceited. As a Minister he is not a success, for he leaves the work of the War Ministry to the Chief of Staff as he left the work of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs to the Under secretary. Is friendly to His Majesty’s Government. Speaks no foreign language, but understands a little French. 8. Buzurjmehri, General Kerim A gha. Born about 1878. Formerly a non-commissioned officer in the Cossack Brigade. Rose from the ranks and served for years as a brother officer of Reza Shah Pahlavi. He followed the fortunes of the latter, who, when he became Minister of War, used his influence to make Kerim Agha Director of the Tehran Municipality. In September 1929 Kerim Agha was made Minister of Public Works in addition to his directorship of the municipality, but in March 1930 the Ministry of Public Works was divided up into the Ministries of Public Economy and of Roads and Communications and after that Kerim Agha retained only the municipality. He has given considerable personal attention to the modernising of Tehran, widening the streets by forcing the owners of houses and shops to pull down their antiquated buildings and reconstruct them on more modern linesafter ceding to the municipality for a mere song the amount of frontage necessary for enlarging the streets. His methods have not been strictly legal and at first caused a considerable amount of discontent amongst property owners, but he has without doubt improved the aspect of the capital and as the newly-constructed properties are bringing in to their owmers considerably enhanced rents the former discontent has gradually died down. High-handed methods were perhaps necessary to force the Tehranis to co-operate in the improvement of the city and Kerim Agha’s driving power has proved invaluable. He is a man of no education and his standard of intelligence is below that necessary for a ministerial post. He caused the Railway Syndicate so much trouble, even going so far as to refuse to pay the monetary instalments as they fell due, that the latter were compelled to give him an ulti matum threatening to close down if he persisted in being obstructive. This caused the Shah to invoke the help of Teymourtache, \yho was able to smoothe matters over and satisfy the syndicate. As Minister of Public Works he was certainly not the success that he was as Director of Municipality. Before he attained ministerial rank he had been in charge of the private estates of the Shah and is said to have enlarged them considerably at the expense of the owners of neighbouring estates and by methods which will not bear too close scrutiny. He speaks no foreign language, but understands a little Russian.D. Dadger, Mirza Hussein Khan. Born about 1882. First came into prominence as a member of the Democratic party in the third Majlis (1914-15). In 1916 he turned against the party.

Returned to Persia about 1922 and edited a paper called the “ Shafaq Surkh.’' As an editor he became notorious for slanderous abuse and the extortion of money by blackmail, and his abuse of Great Britain and British statesmen was frequently the subject of complaint from His Majesty’s Legation to the Persian Government. He was elected a Deputy to the fifth 'Majlis in 1924, but he was refused a seat by the Parliamentary Commission whose duty it was to scrutinise his election proceedings. He was prominent in the abortive Republican movement in 1924 and i&amp; said to have received and pocketed large sums from Reza Pahlavi, on whose behalf he worked. After acquiring a share of this world's goods he appeared to become more human and ceased the abuse and vituperation for which he had become famous. He espoused the cause of Reza Pahlavi against Ahmed Shah and was elected a Deputy to the sixth Majlis in 1926. He was invited to Moscow in October 1927 to attend the tenth anniversary of the Soviet regime. From Moscow he went to Berlin and Paris and returned to Persia early in 1928. He was elected a Deputy to the seventh Majlis in 1928, and to the eighth Majlis in 1930. He still edits his paper and receives subsidies in money or in paper, now from the Shah and now from the Soviet Embassy. He has put aside his turban for the Pahlavi hat and aspires to a ministerial post. He is a hot-headed firebrand with no scruples and no principles and is capable of the basest villainy if it will help him to attain his ends. He speaks no European language 11. Daver, Mirza Ali Akber Khan. Born about 1887. The son of a subordinate official in the private Treasury of Muzaffer-ed-Din Shah. He was educated in Tehran. He began his career as Chief of the Cabinet to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in 1909 and subse quently transferred to the Ministry of Justice where he rose to be a public prosecutor. In 1910 he accompanied some Persian children to Switzerland as tutor and stayed there to study law, finally taking his degree at Geneva. He returned to Persia in 1921 and edited a newspaper. He was elected a Deputy to the fourth, fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis, and, in addition, exercised the E rofessron of a lawyer. Elected to the Constituent Assembly in December 1925, e was chosen by the members of that Assembly to revise the constitutional law in a way which would permit of the accession of Reza Pahlavi as Shah. He revised the law and successfully defended it before the Assembly for which he earned the gratitude of Reza Pahlavi. He was appointed Minister of Public Works from December 1925 to June 1926 when he took his seat in the Majlis. He vras appointed Minister of Justice in February 1927 and displayed feverish energy in sweeping away the old judicial courts' and paving the way for the Shah's proclamation in April of the impending abolition of the capitulations. Daver is a studious, intelligent and well-read man, in addition to being a capable lawyer. He founded a'Radical party in Persia which attracted many adherents but which subsequently died away. He has worked unremittingly at the modernisation of the judiciary and has succeeded extremely well. He is a pleasant man to meet socially although he frequents European society rarely, being entirely taken up with his work. He is not entirely free from demagogy and6 untruth fulness. Left for Europe in August 1930 to undergo an operation; returned to Tehran in October. He speaks French perfectly. 12. Esfendiari, Mirza Hassan Khan. Born about 1862.

Hostile to the Allies in the war, he was bought by the Germans in 1915, but that did not prevent him taking money from the Russians as well. Reputed to be dishonest and an intriguer. When Minister of Finance in 1917 he caused the grain in the Government stores to be sold in order to pay up arrears of salaries due to Government employees, and by this act was partly responsible for the mortality caused in Tehran by the famine which followed the crop failure of 1917.

Appointed Persian Minister to Germany in May 1930, and left for Berlin on the 25th June. Neither as Minister for Foreign Affairs nor as Minister of Finance did he show the smallest initiative, but merely carried out the orders of the Minister of Court; in fact he has no initiative nor does he carry any weight and has probably little lust for work. As Minister for Foreign Affairs he appeared in the role of a polite obstructionist. Seems to lack energy both of mind and body. Recalled to Tehran in December 1931 as a result of the Persian Government’s dissatisfaction with certain articles published in a Munich newspaper in criticism of the Shah and the Pahlavi regime. He speaks French and German. 14. Fatemi, Mirza Sayyid Mehdi Khan. Born about 1886.

He was first Persian delegate to the League m the September 1928 Assembly and was Persian delegate at Locarno in December 1928.

He was recalled from Turkey in March 1930 and was appointed Minister of National Economy in April and in the following month was, in addition, appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs. Honest, well-read and an interesting and intelligent conversationalist, but entirely lacking in character, energy and decision.

Born about 1888, the eldest son of Prince Farman Farmayun and great-great grandson of Fath Ali Shah. He was educated in Beirut and in France and is a member of the Paris Bar.

Again appointed Minister of Justice in 1918 and Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1919 Accompanied Sultan Ahmed Shah to Europe in 1919, was received by His Majesty King George and created a G.C.M.G. During the European War his sentiments were pro-Ally, and he was one of the three negotiators of the Anglo-Persian Convention of 1919. He returned to Persia at the end of 1920. and together with his father, was arrested by Sayyid Zia-ed-Din after the coup d'FAat in^the sprm^ of 1920. When the Sayyid fell from power a few weeks later he was released He blamed His Majesty's Government for having allowed his arrest and after his release he showed violent anti-British sentiments. Elected a Deputy to the fourth fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis. Made his peace with His Majesty’s Legation m 1923 and was appointed Governor-General of Fars 1923-24, where he was quite successful.

He was kept in confinement in his house until April 1930 when he was prosecuted for bribery and corruption in connexion with the deficit found in the Government granaries. He was found8 guilty of having taken 1,936 tomans and on the 1st May was sentenced to a fine of three times the amount of the sum involved, to imprisonment for four months and loss of civil rights. On the 12th June he was released from the State prison nominally for reasons of health and permitted to finish the period of imprisonment in his own house. Firuz Mirza was generally reckoned as one of the most intelligent and able of the young Persians and was a very clever politician; he is, however, extremely unscrupulous and is hated by most of his compatriots. Although he made his peace with this Legation in 1923 he rarely missed an opportunity of creating annoyances for Great Britain and there was little room for confidence in him; in fact he seems to possess all the qualities that are bad and there is hardly a thing to be said in his favour. His condemnation to the loss of civil rights is likely to remove him from politics for a time if not for ever, but even should he come back it is difficult to believe that he will play so important a role as in the past. Speaks French fluently and a little English. 17. Ghaffari, Hassan Ali Khan. Born about 1890, son of the late Moavin-ed-Dowleh, a former Minister for Foreign Affairs. Educated in Europe.

He was dismissed in November 1929 for permitting publication in the press of the judicial safeguards accorded to foreign subjects in 1928, after the abolition of the extra-territorial privileges, but was reinstated in December 1929. He owed his appointment and reinstatement to Teymourtache, the Minister of Court, witih whom he is on terms of intimate friendship.

His hatred of Russia caused him to favour the German cause during the European War, and as a result he was often very unfriendly towards Great Britain. Of later years he has become more friendly, and endeavours to eschew political intrigue. As Prime Minister he is but a figure-head, and carries out the policy which Teymourtache dictates. He is addicted to opium smoking, and is rapidly becoming more enfeebled in both mind and body.r 19. Jam, Mirza Mahmud Khan. Born about 1882.

Previously known as Nasr-ul-Mulk. Born about 1880, the son of the late Mukhbir-ud-Dowleh, K.C.I.E., who helped to introduce telegraphs into Persia and was for many years Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Kama!

He was well educated and speaks French fairly well. He understands a good deal of English when he hears it, but cannot speak English freely. He was prominent in the political events associated with the Constitutional troubles of 1909-11, and became a member of the second Majlis in 1913. In March 1915 he was appointed Minister of Posts, Telegraphs, Commerce and Public Works, and in that capacity was suspected (in common with his uncle, [470 c—2] c (the present Prime Minister) of pro-German leanings. He held various ministerial posts in the subsequent years : being again Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in 1917, Minister of Justice in 1918, and again in 1920, Minister without portfolio in 1920, Minister of Public Works in 1921.

Three months afterwards he was appointed to the post of Governor-General of Ears, and in December 1927 went to Bagdad as acting consul-general. His tenure of office at Bagdad was not a success : he fell foul of the Residency owing to certain discourteous omissions in his conduct towards the Residency officials. Whether or not these trans gressions were performed on his own responsibility or under instructions from his Government, the latter soon recalled him in some disfavour. Thereafter he was unemployed until December 1931, when he was appointed Persian Minister at Tokyo in succession to the late Hovhannes Khan Mussayed. He is a pleasant and intelligent little man. His relations with British consular officers at Isfahan and Shiraz were always cordial and friendly, but he is not a great personality. 22. Kazemi, Seyed Bag her Khan. Born about 1887.

Born about 1870, a native of the Province of Isfahan. He started his career as a religious teacher and dabbled in politics for years before entering Parliament as a member for Isfahan in 1914. He was a leading member of the Provisional Government set up by the Muhajerin or pro-German exiles at Kermanshah in 1915 and went to Constantinople, only returning to Persia early in 1918. He took refuge in the mosque at Shah Abdul Azim, near Tehran, as a protest against the Cabinet of Nejef Quli Khan Bakhtiari in the summer of 1918, and worked hard to bring in the Cabinet of Mirza Hassan Khan Vossuq in the summer of that year. He later quarrelled with Vossuq over the Anglo-Persian Convention, thereby gaining much renown and popularity. Was a prominent Deputy in the fourth, fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis, but was not allowed to be elected a Deputy to the seventh term when the elections were strictly controlled by the Government. He was exiled to Khorasan in October 1928 and has never been allowed to come back to Tehran. He was responsible more than any other individual in bringing about the failure of the Republican movement in 1924. He leads a very simple life and is much revered by the lower classes, who used to frequent his house and ask his advice on all sorts of questions. He is quite fearless and frank and expresses his opinions freely, and nobody, not even the Shah, escaped his criticisms. An apparently organised attempt to assassinate him was made in October 1926 one morning in the street, but, although wounded in three places, he managed to escape with his life. For an old-fashioned cleric, he is cute and far-sighted, but is a demagogue and obstinate. Speaks no European language. 26. Muhsin, Suleiman Mirza. Born about 1875. An obscure Qajar Prince, probably descended from the numerous progeny of Fath Ali Shah. In the early years of the Persian Constitution he was one of the leaders of the Democrat party. Elected a Deputy to the third Majlis, and left Tehran with the pro-German clique in 1915 for Bagdad and Constantinople. On the capture by the British forces of Bagdad, Suleiman Mirza took refuge with the Sinjabi tribe on the Perso-Iraq frontier, whence he conducted a system of espionage against the British army. On the Sinjabis refusing to surrender him, they were attacked in 1918 and Suleiman Mirza was captured and sent to India. He returned to Persia in 1921 and was again elected to the Majlis, where he led a small Socialist group. Was again elected to the fifth term of the Majlis and was leader of the minority party. Appointed Minister of Education in 1923, but did nothing beyond filling the posts of that Ministry with his Socialist friends. Since the establishment of a Soviet representation in this country Suleiman Mirza has been on terms of close friendship with the Soviets, but he has lost any popularity he ever had and his Socialist party has broken down badly. In October 1927 he went to Moscow to be present at the tenth anniversary of the Soviet regime, and afterwards he visited Berlin and Paris, returning to Persia in the winter of 1930. He is a demagogue and time-serving politician, for whom modern Persia has little use. Speaks no European language. 27. Mushar, Mirza Hassan Khan. Born about 1874. Started his career in the Ministry of Finance and rose to be an accountant. Appointed Minister of Finance in i916, and again in 1918 in the Cabinet of Mirza Hassan Khan Vossuq, subsequently exchanging that post for that of Minister without portfolio until June 1920. Appointed Minister of Court by Sayyid Zia-ed-Din in 1921. Elected a Deputy to the fourth term of the Majlis in 1921, but, being suspected of plotting against Reza Khan Pahlavi, then Minister of War, he was obliged to resign and go to Europe. He returned to Persia in 1924, his innocence having been meanwhile established. Appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in August 1924 and resigned in December 1925 [470 c—2] c 212 Appointed Minister of Finance in November 1929, but resigned in April 1930 having found that the interference of the Minister of ( ourt in financial administration rendered his position untenable. He is a man of common sense and intelligence. As Minister lor Foreign Affairs, he showed himself very friendly to His Majesty’s Legation and used his best endeavours for the settlement of outstanding questions. He is not popular with many of his compatriots in high places owing to his straightforward character and outspokenness. Speaks no foreign language. 28. Musaddiq, Dr. Muhammad Khan. Born about 1885. Is a nephew of Farman Farmayan. Has studied law in Paris to a certain extent and poses as a jurist. Appointed Governor-General ot Fars in 1920. Appointed Minister of Justice for four months in July 1920. Appointed Minister of Finance in June 1921 and sought and obtained authority from Parliament to purge and reform that Ministry. However, during his six months’ tenure of that portfolio he destroyed indiscriminately the good with the bad, and at the end the organisation was worse than before, as he proved himself entirely incapable of making reforms. Appointed Governor-General of Azerbaijan in 1922, and in 1923 became Minister for Foreign Affairs for a period of four months. Elected as a Deputy to the fourth, fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis from Tehran. Owing to his’opposition to the Government in the sixth term, steps were taken to prevent him from being elected to later terms of the Majlis. He is a demagogue and a windbag. Speaks French fluently. 29. Mustauft, Mirza Hassan Khan. Born about 1870; formerly known as Mustaufi-el-Mamalek. His father, Mustaufi-el-Mamalek. was a former Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, who died in 1882, leaving large estates and a considerable fortune. Mirza Hassan Khan went to Europe in 1900 and stayed there seven years, during which period he squandered most of the wealth he had inherited. When he returned to Persia in 1907 he was appointed Paymaster-General of the Army. He was elected a Deputy to the Majlis in 1908, and became in 1909 Minister of War and subsequently Minister of Finance. In 1910 he became Prime Minister, but resigned the following year. In 1913 he again became Minister of War, and in 1914 again Prime Minister. Resigning in March 1915, he was again called upon in August and was Prime Minister and Minister of Interior until December 1915. From June-December 1917 he was a Minister without portfolio, and from January-April 1918 he was Prime Minister. In July 1920 he was again a Minister without portfolio until November 1920. He held no post until February 1923, when he again became Prime Minister until June of the same year. In June 1926 he was again Prime Minister until May 1927, when he resigned. He was elected a Deputy for Tehran in the seventh term of the Majlis (October 1928), but he refused to accept. He is a typical old-time Persian gentleman, fond of hawking and hunting, but he is a man of weak character and incapable of taking a decision on the most unimportant matter. He is universally liked but has no qualities of administra tion or organisation. He has entirely squandered the fortune he inherited. His lack of decision was very noticeable during his premiership in 1915, when he weakly allowed the pro-German partv a free rein. He acquired thereby a reputation for unfriendliness towards the Allies, but it may be stated that he was not unfriendly but simply lacking in energy. His character remains the same. He understands and speaks a little French. 30. Nizam Qaragozlu, Hussein Quli Khan. Born in 1883, the eldest son of the late Amir Nizam. A member of the Qaragozlu family of Hamadan and a nephew of the late Regent, Nasr-ul-Mulk. Educated in England and Austria. Passed through the Military Academy at Vienna and served with a commission in an Austrian infantry regiment for three years. Inherited large estates from his father in the district of Hamadan, but owing to his absence in Europe from 1921 to 1929, these estates have been allowed to deteriorate. Was appointed Governor of Kermanshah by Vossuq in 1919, where he was very popular on account of his honesty and integrity. Being a rich man13 (?V jt y {§5 he was imprisoned at the time of the coup d'Etat in 1921 and made to pay 20,000 tomans as the price of his release. He was so disgusted at this unmerited treatment that he left Persia and vowed never to return. During his stay in Europe he lost heavily at Monte Carlo and Deauville. Teymourtache met him in Europe in 1928 and persuaded him to return to Persia, which he did the following year. Appointed Grand Master of Ceremonies at the Court in March 1929. Sent to Europe on private business for the Shah in March 1930 and returned at the end of December. An extremely agreeable and likeable man with more than a veneer of European culture. Is the best type of educated young Persian and is noted for his honesty and integrity. Speaks fluently French, German and English. 31.. Paki avan, Mirza Fathullah Khan. Born about 1885. First became known as a member of the second Majlis, where it appears that he was the laughing-stock of his colleagues. In 1910 he obtained the appointment of Persian consul-general in Constantinople although he had had no previous career in any Government Department. From Con stantinople he went to Egypt as consul-general and later became Persian Minister there until he returned to Tehran early in 1925. In 1925 he was appointed Director of the Russian and Turkish Section in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Soviet Embassy objected to this appointment at first on the score that Pakravan, having been many years in Egypt, was probably a British agent. Finally, the Soviet Embassy withdrew its objection and Pakravan became persona grata with the Russians so much that when Ansari became Minister for Foreign Affairs in July 1926 the Soviet Embassy asked that Pakravan be appointed Under-Secretary. He duly received this appointment and was in charge of the Ministry during Ansari’s absence in Moscow until he was appointed Persian Minister in Rome in December 1928. When he assumed charge of the Foreign Ministry the first impression he conveyed was that of an agreeable and conscientious young man, but closer contact proved him to be a garrulous nonentity. Teymourtache exercised a close super vision over matters relating to the Foreign Ministry and it was evident that Pakravan carried no weight and was but a figurehead. Teymourtache was at no pains to hide the fact that he considered Pakravan merely an amiable fool. Interviews with him were mere waste of time, and during the twenty months that he was in charge of the Ministry affairs remained at a standstill. Appointed Persian Ambassador to the U.S.S.R. in February 1931. Speaks French fluently. 32. Pahlavi, Reza Shah. Born about 1873. Comes of a small family from Sawad Kuh, in Mazanderan. His father was a Persian and his mother of Caucasian stock, whose parents sought refuge in Persia when certain Caucasian districts were ceded to Russia by the Treaty of Turkomanchai. He entered the Persian Cossack Brigade at the age of 15 and was employed as a stable boy. He rose from the ranks and gained the approval of the Russian instructors of the brigade for his courage and fearlessness, and whenever an expedition was sent to any part of the country to round up brigands or quell a disturbance, he seems to have taken part in it. At the beginning of the war he had been promoted colonel and in 1921, when the Cossack Brigade, previously transformed into a division, was deprived of its Russian officers and was being reformed after a severe defeat at the hands of the Bolshevik forces in North Persia, was in need of a resolute leader, the choice fell on Reza Khan. In March 1921 he marched at its head towards Tehran, which he took with the greatest ease, installing Sayyid Zia-ed-Din as Premier, keeping the command of the army himself. Thereafter, his rise to power was rapid. Six weeks later he became Minister of War and held that office until the 31st October, 1925, becoming Prime Minister as well from October 1923 onwards. On the 31st October, 1925, the Majlis deposed Sultan Ahmed Shah and entrusted the provisional direction of the country to Reza Khan Pahlavi. On the 16th December, 1925, in consequence of the decision of the Constituent Assembly, Reza Khan succeeded to the Throne of Persia with the title of Reza Shah Pahlavi. He was crowned in April 1926.He is an entirely self-educated man with a natural dignity. He has a strong character and has a great deal of ability and energy. Full of ambition, he has set out to extricate Persia from disintegration and from the morass of inefficiency into which it had fallen, and to raise it to a position of real independence. In spite of tremendous difficulties, he has already succeeded to a large extent. He may succeed entirely if he lives long enough, but he has not succeeded in changing the national character of sloth and idleness, and it is therefore doubtful if, after ^ his demise, the work will be carried on. He is not popular but is feared, and this in an oriental country is the more advantageous. He is insincere, in the sense that he regards prevarication and duplicity as fair weapons; he is thoroughly suspicious of anybody whom he suspects of being cleverer than himself, and he does not hesitate to put into retirement any army commander who has shown himself too successful in the field. He cannot be said to have endeared himself to any of his subjects nor to have attracted them to himself in such a way that he could count on their fidelity in any awkward situation. Since the beginning of 1930 the Minister of Court has made access to the Royal presence more and more difficult, with the result that the Shah is much less in contact with public opinion than formerly. Reza Shah is avaricious and greedy of wealth, and all means whereby he can acquire money and lands are good to him. He indulges in opium and native i spirits and has become stouter and more bloated since becoming Shah than he' was when he led the active life of an army commander. Whilst feared by his subjects by reason of his rough tongue and his rougher methods of treatment, he himself is not without fear, and it is said that he never goes to bed without having within reach several weapons and that he frequently starts up from his sleep to grasp one of them. He is without pity towards all w horn he suspects of plotting against him, and mere suspicion is often enough to condemn them to lifelong prison, if not to death. Finally, it may be said that his great skill in dealing with his own compatriots has its counterpart in a sublime ignorance of foreign mentality Beyond once returning from Khuzistan to Tehran via Bagdad, he has never been outside Persia. He speaks a little Russian, learnt during his service under Russian officers of the Persian Cossack Brigade. 33. Pirnia, Mirza Hassan Khan, G.C.M.G. Born about 1872, the eldest son of the late Mushir-ed-Dowleh who was Foreign Minister for many years and died in 1907. Educated in Russia Appointed Persian Minister to the Court of Russia in 1902. He joined the Constitutional party in 1906 and was one of the Progressives who were instru mental in obtaining the signature of Muzaffei:-ed-Din Shah to the Constitution. He translated from the French and Russian many laws on which the Persian Constitution was based. In 1907 he was sent to London as Special Envoy to announce the accession to the Throne of Persia of Muhammad Ali Shah and was created G.C.M.G. Appointed Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs for a few months at the end of 1907 and again at the beginning of 1908, and Minister of Justice from July 1908 to January 1909. He has also at various times been Minister of War. He became Prime Minister in March 1915 for a month in 1920 for four months, in 1922 for six months and in 1923 for five months. ’He and his brother, Hussein Khan Pirnia, have generally been the two most favoured candidates from Tehran for the Majlis, but they refused to take their seats in the seventh term of the Majlis as, in their opinion, the elections had not been freely held. Mirza Hassan Khan Pirnia is a very intelligent man with a good reputation for honesty amongst his compatriots, but he is very timorous and has alwavs preferred to resign office rather than face a crisis. He inherited large estates from his father and is very wealthy. He speaks French and Russian fluently. 34. Pirnia, Mirza Hussein Khan. Born about 1875, the second son of the late Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Educated in France. After finishing his studies he returned to Persia in 1902, and became secretary to his father, who was then Minister for Foreign Affairs. Received his first Cabinet appointment in 1918 as Minister of Education. W^as appointed aMinister without fortfolio in 1920. He has generally preferred a parliamentary to a ministerial career, and was elected to every term of the Majlis since its inception until the seventh term. To that term, also, he was elected, but refused to take his seat, as he did not consider the elections to have been held freely. He was chosen as president for the whole terms of the third and fourth Parliaments and for the greater part of the fifth term and for half of the sixth term, and he showed himself to lx? firm and impartial. He is an intelligent man, of firm character, but of a modest and retiring disposition. He is studious and well-read. He talks French and English fluently. 35. Qaragozlu, Mirza Yahya Khan. Born about 1890, son of the late Beha-ul-Mulk Qaragozlu. Educated in France, where he spent many years. Was once an Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Interior. Appointed in 1927 a counsellor in the Court of Appeal, under the reorganised judiciary. In January 1928 appointed Minister of Public Instruction, but has shown little aptitude in the affairs of his Ministry to judge from the press attacks on the educational system. Qaragozlu is very friendly with Teymourtache and Firuz Mirza, and it was by reason of that friendship that he was appointed Minister of Education. Is a landowner in the Hamadan district and is well off. He has a reputation for honesty and is conceited. Chosen as special Persian representative at the Persian National Art Exhibition to be held in London in January 1931 and left Tehran for London in December 1930. Speaks French fluently. 36. Rahnema, Mirza Zein-ul-A bedin Khan. Born about 1888, one of the sons of the late Sheikh-ul-Araquein, a Persian subject and small Mujtehid of Kerbela. Rahnema was educated in Iraq and came to Persia about 1910. He was a member of the Democratic party and edited first the newspaper “ Rahnema ’ ’ and subsequently the semi-official paper “Iran.” He was elected a Deputy to the fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis. Was sent to Europe in 1923 on a mission to “boom ' Persia, and stayed most of the time in Paris. Was appointed Under secretary to the Ministry of Public Works at the end of 1926 and Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Interior in April 1927. In June 1927 he became assistant to the Prime Minister, but was dismissed in January 1928 and fell from favour. From that time he has confined himself to journalism and accompanied the Shah on his journey to Khuzistan in October 1928 as press representative. He appears to have worked his way back to favour, and his paper is regarded as the Government organ. Rahnema is an ambitious young man, with plenty of “push.” His great ambition has always been to obtain a Government post, which he hoped would culminate in a ministerial appointment. With that object in view, he discarded his turban and gave up his title of “ sheikh.” This brought him three different Under-Secretaryships in succession. He is intelligent and clever in a certain sense. As a journalist he has always been fairly scrupulous, and took no part in the campaign of blackmail in which most of his journalist colleagues indulged in the years 1921-25. Speaks a little French. 37. Sadiqi, Mirza Sadiq Khan. Born about 1865. Educated at Constantinople. Was a secretary at the Persian Embassy in Turkey for many years. Elected a Deputy from Tabriz, his native town, to the First Majlis in 1906. Elected President of the Second Majlis in 1909. An ardent Constitutionalist he was arrested by Mohammad Ali Shah in 1908 and imprisoned until January 1909. Elected a member of the committee which was convened to draw up the Electoral Law. Appointed Minister of Interior in 1911, Minister of Posts in 1914 and 1915, and again Minister of Interior in 1915 and in June 1917. In the following Cabinet he was a Minister without portfolio.mmm ' v',' ■ h ■■m ^ ir&gt; Before the war he was pro-Russian, but when war broke out he espoused the cause of Germany and Turkey and was one of the most extreme of “ Enemy partisans.’’ After the war His Majesty’s Legation demanded that he be exiled to some outlying province of Persia. From that time, with the exception of a short period in 1921 when he was a Cabinet Minister without portfolio, he lived a retired life and had little or no influence. Appointed Persian Ambassador to Turkey in January 1931. Speaks French and Turkish. 38. Samiyi, Mirza Hussein Khan. Born about 1878, a native of Resht. Has spent his early career in the Ministry of Interior and was once Governor of Resht. Appointed Minister of Public Works 1921 to June 1922. In March 1923 he became Minister of Interior for three months. When the present Shah became Prime Minister in October 1923, Samiyi was chosen as his assistant, until, in August 1924, he was appointed Minister of Justice. Early in 1926 he was appointed Governor of Tehran and held that post until he was appointed Minister of Interior in June 1927. Samiyi is a pleasant man, but of little influence. He is not very energetic nor highly intelligent. He speaks no foreign language. 39. Samiyi, Mirza Inayatullah Khan. Formerly known as Mudabbir-ud-Douleh. One of the younger school : Born about 1887. Educated partly in Belgium. Is a member of a well-known Persian family, and is related to Mirza Hussein Khan Samiyi. Began his career in the Ministry of the Interior. Appointed Director of the Eastern section of that Ministry in 1919. In 1923, when the present Shah was Prime Minister, was confidential secretary to his Highness, and appears to have retained ever since the latter’s confidence : He was appointed his “ chef de cabinet ” in 1924. Promoted Under secretary to the Ministry of the Interior in 1927, and subsequently became Under secretary at the Ministry of Public Instruction. In 1929, when the Persian Government first accorded full recognition to Iraq, he was appointed first Persian Minister at Bagdad. He did not occupy that post long, and does not appear to have made a great success of it. He disliked Bagdad and when the Persian Ministry of National Economics was first started (in January 1931) he was recalled to become the first official in charge of that post, with the rank of acting Minister. On the imposition of the new Trade Monopoly Laws in June 1931, however, he either resigned or was dismissed, and was then unemployed until appointed in December 1931 Persian Minister at Berlin. He speaks French and a little English, but rarely frequents European society. He appears to be a clever (perhaps “ cunning ” would be a more appropriate word) young man of the ultra-Nationalist type. 40. Shahbakhti, General Muhammad Khan. Born about 1882, the son of a peasant inhabiting the village of Ishtihar, near Tehran. He enlisted in the Cossack Brigade about 1901, distinguished himself by bravery in the field, and received a commission. In 1914 he was a captain. He attached himself to Reza Khan, whose influence with General Starosselsky secured him promotion to the rank of colonel in 1919. After the coup d'Etat of 1921 he was appointed to command the Ahan regiment of infantry. In 1925 he was promoted general and given command of an infantry brigade in Tehran. In 1926 he was sent to command the Western Division, but was recalled in the spring of 1928 for corruption; he, however, managed to ingratiate himself with the Shah, and was appointed shortly afterwards to command the Persian troops in Kurdistan. In December 1928 he was sent to command the troops in Fars, but was superseded by General Shaibani. Shahbakhti is almost entirely uneducated and boorish in manner. He eschews politics, has no relations with foreigners, and is reputed to be fanaticaL The Shah regards him as a stupid but practical officer and a loyal follower.Understands a little Russian, a relic of the days when he served in the Cossack Brigade under Russian officers. 41. Shaibani, General Habibullah Khan. Born about 1885, the son of Nazm-ed-Dowleh, who came of a middle-class family of Kashan. In 1906 Shaibani went to St. Cyr, where he graduated in 1910 and joined a French regiment. Returned to Persia in 1913, and was commissioned into the Swedish-officered gendarmerie as a captain. He was highly regarded by the Swedish officers, and was promoted major in 1914. He was strongly anti- Russian, and consequently anti-Ally, during the war, and he joined the Muhajerin (the pro-German party), and remained in Turkey until 1918, when he returned to Tehran and re-entered the gendarmerie. He appears to have made contact with Reza Khan about 1920, and was working in his interests before the cou'p d'Ktat. Promoted colonel in 1921, he served in the operations against the Jangalis and against Simitko. Promoted General of Brigade in 1922, and in 1923 went to France in charge of Persian military students. He entered the French Staff College and graduated with distinction in 1925. He attended the Arms Traffic Conference at the League as Persian representative in the autumn of 1925, and was very sore at the success of the British representative in getting the Persian Gulf included in the Maritime Zone. In 1926 he was appointed acting Chief of the General Staff. He resigned that appointment in March 1928 owing to his disagreement with certain orders issued by the Shah. Appointed Minister of Public Works in May 1928 until December, when he lost that appoint ment and was placed en disponibilite. Appointed a member of the High Military Council in January 1929. Promoted General of Division in June 1929, he was sent to command the army in Pars to deal with the rebellion in that province. He was successful in restoring order, as the Qashgai, although in a fighting mood, were short of munitions. In 1930 he commanded the operations in the Mamasenni district and against the Kuhgeluis, and by October he had succeeded in reducing the Kuhgeluis, only one of their khans still refusing to make his submission to the Government. Shaibani is a man of independent views, and is somewffiat rigid and narrow minded. He is a strict disciplinarian, and does not play to the gallery. His military ideas are conservative and sound, and he is perhaps the only French- trained officer who has not been led away from the realisation of realities. He regards Russia as the enemy of Persia; of the motives underlying British policy he has a fair understanding, and he thinks that Britain can and should help Persia in her own interests, but he believes that Britain will always sacrifice Persia if it should be in her interest to do so. He is intensely patriotic, and will stoutly oppose whatever he considers to be derogatory to Persian sovereignty or detrimental to Persian independence. At the same time he views with disfavour Persia’s hasty efforts to play the role of a civilised nation. He is remarkably honest, direct in speech, and prompt in action. He has little sympathy with Persian officialdom. His nickname in the army is “ Feranghi/’ not by reason of any imitation of Europeans, but rather because of the un-Persian nature of his character. He speaks French fluently. Tried by a military court-martial in the autumn of 1931, on a charge of military inefficiency in his 1930 operations against the Mamasenni and the Boir Ahmedi tribes, resulting in some 500 Persian casualties. Sentenced to two years' imprisonment and deprivation of all his ranks and dignities. 42. Tadayun, Sayyid Muhammad. Born about 1884, a native of Birjand in East Persia; educated in Tehran, where he graduated and became a schoolmaster. After the split up of the original Democrat party in 1912, Tadayun became the leader of one of the more important Democrat factions. He was elected a Deputy from Tehran to the fourth term of the Majlis, and from Birjand to the fifth and sixth terms. Was elected president of the Majlis in the second half of the fifth term and again at the beginning of the sixth term. In February 1927 he was appointed Minister of Education, but in December he resigned that appointment owing to disagree ment with his colleagues in the Cabinet, but he resumed office nine days later atthe personal request of the Shah. On the 7th January, 1928, the bhah ordered him to resign, and his fall was said to be due to the personal animosity towards him of Teymourtache, who even vetoed his candidature as a Deputy to the seventh term of the Majlis. In June 1930 he was appointed Governor of Kerman, and appears to have recovered the Royal favour to a certain extent. Tadayun was one of the principal supporters of the Republican movement in 1924, and is said to have appropriated to himself a large part of the funds put at his disposal for the realisation of that object. As president of the Majlis he was a success, being impartial and strict in upholding the rules of the House. He is undoubtedly an intelligent man and has a very pleasant manner. He knows a little French. 43. Taqizadeh, Sayyid Hassan. Born in Tabriz about 1880, the son of a small preacher. He was educated in his native town and used to haunt the booksellers shops, where he showed great eagerness to acquire knowledge. In his early youth he was an ardent Nationalist, and was connected with the Nationalist movement in Persia from the beginning. He was elected to the first term of the Majlis and was one of its most prominent members. Mohammad Ali Shah hated and feared him, and when the Shah made a couf d'Etat in 1908 against the Majlis, Taqizadeh took refuge in His Majesty's Legation. The demand made by the Shah that he should be given up was refused, and Taqizadeh was eventually amnestied, on the condition that he went to Europe. He visited London and Cambridge, but returned to Tabriz at the end of 1908. He was elected to the second term of the Majlis in 1909, and after the capture of Tehran by the Nationalist forces and the abdication of Mohammad Ali Shah in July 1909, Taqizadeh became a prominent member of the Nationalist Committee, which was set up to decide on the Government of the country. Went to Europe in 1910. He was elected in his absence to the third and fourth terms of the Majlis, but did not take his seat. He stayed in Europe and America during the whole of the period from 1914 to 1923, and was for years in Berlin, where he edited a paper called “Kaveh.” For publishing certain articles of an anti-Islamic nature, he was excommunicated by the mujtahids. He negotiated the Perso-Soviet Commercial Treaty in Moscow in February 1921, and finally returned to Persia in 1924. He was elected to the fifth term of the Majlis 1924-26, and to the sixth term in 1926. He visited America again in 1926 as Persian delegate to the Philadelphia Exhibition. Appointed Governor-General of Khorasan in January 1929 ; he was recalled in May and appointed Persian Minister in London, where he remained until April 1930, when he returned to Persia and became Minister of Roads and Communications. In August 1930 he was appointed Minister of Finance, in addition. Taqizadeh is a well-read man and has travelled extensively. He is no longer so notably popular as he was in the early days of the Constitution, and the years have tempered his excessive energy and zeal. His speeches in the Majlis mark him as a man of common sense and moderation, and are in sharp contrast to the utterances of the former fiery young Nationalist. He may well prefer the life of a Deputy to that of a Minister, and he has wrought no miracles since he attained Cabinet rank. He is married to a German and talks German fluently. He speaks English and French less well. 44. Teymourtache, Mirza Abdul Hussein Khan. Born about 1888 of a Khorasan family. Educated in Russia. Elected a Deputy to the third, fourth, fifth and sixth terms of the Majlis. He did not take his seat in the sixth term as he was appointed Minister of Court to Reza Shah Pahlavi before the sixth term opened. He was elected also to the seventh term and accepted, but did not sit. Was Persian member of the Mixed Financial Commission 1916-17. Appointed Governor of Gilan in 1919 and remained there for one year. Minister of Justice, January to June 1922. Governor of Kerman, September 1923 to April 1924. Minister of Public Works from August 1924 to December 1925. After the accession to the Throne of Reza Shah on the 16th December, 1925. Teymourtache took over the duties of Minister of Court. In the summer of 1926 he went on an official mission to Moscow, to try and arrange the terms of a commercial and trading agreement with the Soviet, but was notsuccessful. Visited Germany, Switzerland and France before returning to Persia in December 1926. In the Majlis he showed himself to be a good orator, and as a Minister in the Cabinet he was generally chosen to answer for the Government before the Majlis. Quick-witted and energetic, he has pleasant manners, and is socially agreeable. He is of a light-hearted disposition, witty, but often too flippant; however, a sense of responsibility appears to add sometimes a semblance of gravity to a character which is essentially fickle. He is, moreover, a confirmed gambler, and is not sparing in the use of alcoholic drink. In addition, he works extremely hard, and has been more than once on the verge of a breakdown. He visited Europe in the summer of 1928, and was received by King George V in London. He was also entertained in Paris, Rome, Berlin and Brussels, and returned to Persia in September, when the Shah granted to him the title of “ Highness. As Minister of Court he has acquired the position of the Shah’s most intimate political adviser. His influence is ubiquitous and his power exceeds that of the Prime Minister. He attends all meetings of the Cabinet and his position may be compared to that of Reich Chancellor except that he has no direct responsibility. He is an ardent Nationalist and was responsible for the denunciation of the special treaties wdiich governed the regime of consular jurisdiction. His influence over the Shah appears to be as strong as ever and he has succeeded in encircling His Majesty, only allowing those of whom he is sure to approach him alone. With his compatriots he has become most unpopular as he is known to be responsible for the absurd restrictions on monetary exchange which, since their inception in the spring of 1930, have slowly paralysed all commercial affairs, and which will lead to an economic disaster if persisted in. The condemnation of his friend, Prince Firuz, in the spring of 1930 for corruption and his inability to help him, appeared to weaken his position for a moment, but if it did so he quickly recovered. As regards his integrity, many rumours accuse him of feathering his nest, but if such rumours are true Teymourtache is too clever not to cover up the traces of his transactions. Accompanied the Crown Prince, Shahpur Muhammad Reza, to Europe in September 1931, and stayed some months in Europe, visiting various capitals on State business, including London. Speaks French and Russian fluently and understands English. 45. Vossuq, Mirza Hassan Khan, G.C.B. Born about 1868. Began his career in the Ministry of Finance. Elected a Deputy to the first and second terms of the Majlis, and in 1909 chosen to be a member of the Nationalist Committee which directed the affairs of State after the abdication of Mohammad Ali Shah. His first Cabinet appointment w T as as Minister of Justice in October 1909. In the following month he became Minister of Finance, but resigned in July 1910. In July 1911 he became Minister of Interior, but after a few days he exchanged for the portfolio of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Again Minister for Foreign Affairs in January 1913, he left for Europe in June of the same year. Minister for Foreign Affairs July-August 1914 and Minister of Finance August-December 1915. Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs August 1916 to May 1917. Prime Minister and Minister of Interior from August 1918 to June 1920. Negotiated the Anglo-Persian Convention of 1919. Visited Europe in June 1920 and only returned to Persia at the beginning of 1926. Appointed Minister of Finance in June 1926, but resigned in November to take his seat in Parliament. Elected as a Deputy from Tehran to the seventh term of the Majlis, 1928-1930. A man of great ability and character. He became unpopular over the Anglo-Persian Convention, but, after a most able and convincing defence of his acts as Prime Minister during the period 1918-1920 before the Majlis, he regained a large measure of popularity. Still has some bitter enemies who seem to have prevented him from acquiring the favour of the Shah. His name has been frequently mentioned for diplomatic appointments abroad, but he seems to prefer to live quietly in Tehran. Speaks French fluently, also a little English. 46. Vossuq, Mirza Ahmed Khan. A brother of Mirza Hassan Khan, Vossuq, than whom he is younger by a few years. Began his career in the Ministry of Finance. Became Minister of War July to October 1910 and Minister of Interior July to November 1911 and againin December 1911. Minister of Finance July to August 1914, and Minister of Interior November 1917 to January 1918. Appointed Governor-General of Khorasan April 1918 and remained there for three years, during which he administered the province with uniform success during troublous times. Became Prime Minister and Minister of Interior June 1921 to January 1922, and again Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs from June 1922 to ^ February 1923. Banished to Europe in October 1923, being accused of having plotted against the life of Reza Khan, now Reza Shah. Was allowed to return to Tehran at the end of 1929 and arrived in March 1930, when he went to reside quietly on his property at Lahijan, near Resht. A clever man, but sly, intriguing and unreliable. Has generally been friendly to His Majesty’s Legation. Speaks a little French. 47. Yezdan Penah, General Murteza Khan. Born about 1891, son of Mirza Ali Akbar, a small shopkeeper in the village of Serdasht. In 1907, Murteza Khan entered the Cossack Cadet School. Received his commission in 1912, showed strong pro-Russian sympathies and consequently gained rapid promotion. Made lieutenant-colonel in 1919 and colonel in 1920. During the w r hole of his service he was intimate with Reza Khan and accompanied him on the march to Tehran in February 1921 which culminated in the coup d'Etat. Was promoted general and given the command of the Central Division. In July 1927 he fell from favour and was put under arrest for a short time for an unknown reason. Whatever the suspicions against him were, they appear to have been unsubstantiated, for he was released very soon. In the autumn of 1928, he was appointed inspector of the army, and in the following year he was placed in command of the gendarmerie, but was superseded in 1930 and left without any active command. Murteza Khan was always regarded until 1927 as a very loyal supporter of Reza Shah, but since his arrest in 1927 for no apparent reason he appears to have lost confidence in the Shah. He is active, intelligent, ambitious and a strict disciplinarian. His military ideas and his general education are very limited, but he has shown anxiety to learn. He is not popular amongst the troops, but is feared and respected. Holds aloof from foreigners and is a strong opponent of foreign interference in Persia. In the event of anything happening to Reza Shah Murteza Khan might again come to the fore. Speaks Russian.r / Nos. 2, 21, 22, 23, 37 and 39 in this list are new.

HoareoTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. April 5, 1944. CONFIDENTIAL. ’ Section 1. ^ [E 2118/2118/34] Copy No. Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—[Received hth Aprili) (No. 118.) Sir, Tehran, \±th March, 1944. WITH reference to my despatch No. 213 of the 2nd July, 1940, I have the honour to transmit herewith a revised List of Personalities in Persia. 2. The list has been compiled by Mr. Trott, oriental secretary, from the material accumulated since his return to Persia at the end of 1940. Since the departure of Reza Shah, in September 1941, the available material has greatly increased, both owing to the greater number of consular and other officials in the country who have been able to render reports, and owing to the lifting of the restrictions on intercourse with foreigners which was one of the most tiresome features of the regime of Reza Shah. I regret that the compilation of this record has been so greatly delayed : the delay has been due not only to the great ** increase in the available material but to the continual demands on the oriental secretary’s time which have made it difficult for him to devote much time to compiling records of officials who occupy most of his office hours in long interviews. 3. Mr. Trott has endeavoured to keep track of all persons who have come to see him, and to record all available details.about them in a series of files which will remain on record for his successor. To include them all would have swollen the Personalities List to unwieldy dimensions. He has, therefore, only included the most important in this list. It comprises 236 persons in all; three of the old names have been omitted as the persons concerned seemed of little or no importance; and twenty-seven of those on previous lists have died. Forty-six new names, including a fair number of promising members of the younger genera tion, have been added. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to the Government of India and to the Minister Resident m the Middle East. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure.

His son even married a sister of the Queen; he subsequently died of a mysterious disease. Ayrom left suddenly for Germany, ostensibly for medical treatment, in the summer of 1935. Serious charges of taking bribes and of all kinds of trickery have since been made against him. and Reza Shah, furious with c£ tire only one of my trusted servants who has hitherto deceived me,” tried to secure his extradition.

Son of the late Prince Ala-es-Saltaneh, for many years Persian Minister in London. Educated at Westminster School, where he seems to have received rough treat ment, which resulted in a strong anti-British bias, at any rate for the next few years. Created C.M.G. in 1905, when he accompanied his father on a special mission to London for the coronation of the late King Edward VII. Appointed “chef de cabinet ” in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1906, his late father being then Minister for Foreign Affairs. He remained as “chef de cabinet” to various Ministers until 1915.

This Cabinet abrogated the Treaty of Turkmanchai.

Was also very active in the organisation of the “ Red Lion and Sun, and in the Ferdausi Memorial Committee. In 1931 his transfer to the post of Minister in London was mooted, though it did not materialise. On that occasion His Majesty’s Government were unwilling to receive him, on the ground that his attitude in reporting a libel on His Majesty King George V rendered it difficult to suppose that he was then animated by friendly sentiments. Appointed Minister in London, July 1934. Recalled in the summer of 1936; returned to Tehran in October. Appointed Supervisor of Monopoly Companies, December 1936. Director-General of Commerce in 1937, and given the new appointment of Minister of Commerce in September 1937. Removed from this appointment, April 1938.

Ala was one of the first of her generation to leave off the veil. President of the National Bank, October 1941. Minister of Court, October 1942, but appears to have done nothing to curb the young Shah’s evident intention to rule the country in much the same way as his father did. A hard worker and a staunch patriot; intelligent and well-read; interested in the literature of many countries and quite a good pianist. Has a perfect command of English and speaks good French. In the past he has had a reputa tion for anti-British sentiments. In 1943 and 1944, however, his relations with the British Legation were good; he seems a good deal more anti-Russian than anti-British, and is doubtless more pro-Persian than either. 8.

Townley obtained for him the governorship of Sistan and Qain in 1913. Visited Tehran for some months in 1925, when he kept in close touch with this Legation. He presented Reza Shah with an expensive gift on the occasion of the latter’s coronation in 1926. Since then his power and local influence have been on the decline in proportion as the power of the Central Government has increased. In 1930 he entertained His Majesty the Shah and his suite in a very lavish manner, thereby drawing the Royal attention to his position in East Persia; the consequences of which imprudence nearly ruined him. In 1932, however, he received the second class of the “ Humayun ” order for his services in connexion with the Helmand boundary commission, the whole of the expense of which he bore himself. Visited Tehran in May 1932, to thank the Shah for his order. He was detained at the capital for several months and selected to accompany the Shah in visits to Mazanderan and Shiraz; and was only permitted to return to Birjand in October 1932, when arrangements had been initiated to distribute the lands of the Sistan Sardars (including the Shaukat and several of his relatives) among the peasantry, the theory being that all the land in question was Crown land, which the Sardars had usurped or occupied by force. Appointed Governor-General of Ears, September 1937 until October 1938. Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Tele phones, February 1939.

Opposed the Government during the term of the fifth Majlis and was an opponent of the change of regime. An attempt was made on his liie when the debate on the change of regime took place in the Majlis; but another unfortunate man who resembled him was the victim. Seyyid Hasan Mudarris helped him to get elected to the sixth Majlis. Nothing much was heard of him during Reza Shah’s reign, except that he composed some odes in celebration of the Firdausi centenary in October 1934, and translated into Persian verse a poem by John Drinkwater on that occasion. He has been exiled from Tehran on more than one occasion. In spite of a fondness for opium has been fairly active at Tehran since the change of regime in 1941. Up to August 1942 he and Massoud Sabeti actively supported Qawam-es-Saltaneh’s candidature for the post of Prime Minister. After the latter’s fall early in 1943, Bahar seems to have swung over to the Soviets. He obtained newsprint from the Russians with which he kept his paper No-Bahdr going, and published a series of articles apparently critical of but really supporting Qawam. In fact a shifty and over-subtle politician. Acknowledged to be a leading poet, and a practical newspaper writer. He himself maintains that he is above all anti-Russian, and that that fact is the only source of the false accusation of pro-German feelings often made against him. 42. Bahman, A li A kbar .—Born in Tehran about 1880. Educated in Tehran, as well as in Paris and Russia. On his mother’s side is a descendant of Bahman Mirza, a Qajar prince who emigrated to Russia and declared allegiance to the Tsar.

The author of a work on the principles of prison administration. An honest and capable official, though his nickname “ The Cow ” is not an inapt description of his person, and perhaps of his intelligence. 44. Bahrami, Farajullah (Dabir-i-A ‘zain ).—Born about 1890. A member of a well-known and numerous Tehran family. Munshi or secretary to Reza Shah before and after his accession to the throne in 1925.

After the change of regime in 1941 he has been a prominent member of the Adalat party. Minister of the Interior in January 1943, but he very soon became involved in a quarrel with his chief, Qawam es Saltaneh, which led to the collapse of the latter’s cabinet. His criticisms of his chief in that episode did not create a good impression on this Legation; he is evidently self-opinionated and stubborn. Is very alarmed at the Soviet menace to the independence of Persia. Governor- General of Isfahan, April 1943.

Head of the municipality again July 1943; suspended from his functions during the Tehran elections at the end of 1943 owing to accusations of illegal intervention in the elections, but resumed his functions January* 1944. A large individual with some energy; but he seems to have made a good deal of money by dubious land transactions when head of the municipality. Obstinate like all the Bahramy family. 46. Bakhtiari, Murteza Quli Samsam. —The son of the famous Samsam-us- Saltaneh. Born probably about 1875. Took part in operations against Salar-ud- Douleh in 1911.

Appointed Governor of Bakhtiari early in 1943 and did well, suppressing various upstarts like Abol Ghassem, and establishing order in that tribal area. A clever16 man, not above intrigue. Served Reza Shah well. Very pleasant to meet, but not the sort of man one can trust very far, as he is very much in the hands of his strong-minded wife and also places implicit trust in a worthless agent, Misbah Fatemy. 47. Bayat, Murteza Quli (Saham-es-Sultan). A landowner from Sultanabad, born about 1882. Owns considerable property. Member of the Majlis on several occasions, and Minister of Finance 1926 to 1927.

Keenly interested in mercantile affairs, and helped to float the monopoly company for the landing of cargo in the port of Khorramshahr in 1937. Unpopular with his subordinates. Quick and hot tempered, but less so than formerly. Uses his position for his financial advantage. Not very intelligent, but very hard-working. Speaks French and Italian. Does not appear to like the British. 49. Bushihri-Dehdashti, Agha Javad {Amir Humayun). —Born in Tehran 1898. Second son of the late Haji Muin-ut-Tujjar. Educated at Tehran and in Europe. Speaks French and English. Married a daughter of the late Haji Amin-uz-Zarb. Elected a member of the seventh Majlis. More interested in politics than his elder brother Agha Riza.

Finally got away to Stamboul in 1942 with the help of Count Schulenburg and returned to Tehran March 1943. Arrested and sent to Sultanabad as a suspect in June 1943. A clever man who in the past has always maintained friendly relations with British officials. 50. Bushihri-Dehdashti, Agha Riza. —Born in Tehran, 1896; the eldest surviving son of the late Haji Moin-et-Tujjar. Educated in Tehran and Europe. Married Mme. Lianozoff in 1922.

Speaks French, English and Russian. A go-ahead merchant, always ready for new schemes for making money. Quite pleasant to get on with. 51. Buzurjmehri, General Kerim Agha. —Born about 1878. Formerly a non-commissioned officer in the Cossack Brigade. Rose from the ranks and served for years as a brother officer of Reza Shah Pahlavi. He followed the fortunes of the latter, who, when he became Minister of War, used his influence to make Kerim Agha Director of the Tehran Municipality. In September 1929 Kerim Agha was made Minister of Public Works in addition to his directorship of the municipality, but in March 1930 the Ministry of Public Works was divided into the Ministries of Public Economy and of Roads and Communications, and after that Kerim Agha retained only the municipality. He has given considerable personal attention to the modernising of Tehran, widening the streets by forcing the owners of houses and shops to pull down their antiquated buildings and reconstruct them on more modern lines, after ceding to the municipality for a mere song the amount of frontage necessary for enlarging17 [52—42] d the streets. His methods were not strictly legal, and at first caused a considerable amount of discontent amongst property owners, but he without doubt improved the aspect of the capital, and as the newly-constructed properties are bringing in to their owners considerably enhanced rents, the former discontent has gradually died down. High-handed methods were perhaps necessary to force the Tehranis to co-operate in the improvement of the city, and Kerim Agha’s driving power ^ proved invaluable. He is a man of no education and his standard of intelligence is below that necessary for a ministerial post. He caused the Railway Syndicate so much trouble, even going so far as to refuse to pay the monetary instalments as they fell due, that the latter were compelled to give him an ultimatum, threatening to close down if he persisted in being obstructive. This caused the Shah to invoke the help of Teymourtache, who was able to smoothe matters over and satisfy the syndicate. As Minister of Public Works he was certainly not the success that he was as Director of the Municipality. Before he attained ministerial rank he had been in charge of the private estates of the Shah, and is said to have enlarged them considerably at the expense of the owners of neighbouring estates, and by methods which will not bear too close scrutiny. Commanded a division of the Tehran Garrison in 1937. Visited the Legation once in 1942, but takes no part in politics, and spends most of his time in his village. He speaks no foreign language but understands a little Russian. Kerim Agha is a typical product of the Cossack Brigade and a man of similar character to Reza Shah. He can be very suave and agreeable when he likes, but he is a robber at heart. 52. Dadgar, Hussein (Adl-ul-Mulk). —Born about 1882. First came into prominence as a member of the Democratic party in the third Majlis (1914-15). In 1916 he turned against the party.

President of the seventh Majlis. Elected a member of the eighth Majlis 1930. Left Persia suddenly in the summer of 1935 under circumstances which have never been officially explained. It is said that the Shah suspected him of allowing subversive activities among certain Deputies of the Majlis; or else that he took bribes. Understood to be living in straitened circumstances in Paris 1943. A rumour that he was founding a “ Free Persia ” movement there appears to be unfounded. Outwardly very friendly, but liable to be touchy about protocol questions of precedence; rather vain and stupid. Speaks a little French. 53. Dadvar, Mehdi {Vussuq-es-Saltaneh). —Born about 1874. Entered the service of the Ministry of War when quite young. Chief of Accounts of the Mazanderan Regiments 1905. Joined the Nationalists and came to Tehran with the Nationalist forces.

Attached to one of ephemeral parties in the Majlis in 1942-43, but having failed in his ambition to become once more Minister of War he is devoting some of his time to promoting trade with India. A voluble politician, well disposed towards us, but carrying little weight in the Majlis. 54. Dargahi, Muhammad. —Born about 1886 in Zinjan. His ancestors lived in the Caucasus, and he has been heard to say that he looks forward to the time when the Caucasus will return to its rightful owners, the Persians.

Active and energetic, and extremely vigilant in detecting con spirators against the Shah; vindictive and cruel, and quite unscrupulous in fabricating evidence. A dapper little man in appearance. Living in retirement at Tehran 1943. He has not returned to the limelight since the fall of Reza. 55. Dashti, Ali .—Born about 1887. Educated in the schools of the Holy Places of Iraq. Returned to Persia about 1922 and edited a paper called the Skafaq Surkh. As an editor he became notorious for slanderous abuse and the extortion of money by blackmail, and his abuse of Great Britain and British statesmen was frequently the subject of complaint from His Majesty’s Legation to the Persian Government. He was elected a Deputy to the fifth Majlis in 1924, but he was refused a seat by the Parliamentary Commission, whose duty it was to scrutinise his election proceedings. He was prominent in the abortive Republican movement in 1924, and is said to have received and pocketed large sums from Reza Pahlavi, on whose behalf he worked. After acquiring a share of this world’s goods he appeared to become more human and ceased the abuse and vituperation for which he had become famous. He espoused the cause of Reza Pahlavi against Ahmed Shah, and was elected a Deputy to the sixth Majlis in 1926. He was invited to Moscow in October 1927 to attend the tenth anniversary of the Soviet regime. From Moscow he went to Berlin and Paris and returned to Persia early in 1928, He was elected a Deputy to the seventh Majlis in 1928 and to the eighth Majlis in 1930. Edited or controlled his paper till about July 1935, receiving subsidies now from the Shah and now from the Soviet Embassy. He is a hot-headed firebrand with no scruples and no principles, and is capable of the basest villainy if it will help him to attain his ends. He speaks no European language, except a little French. In July 1935 he fell into disgrace and was said to have uttered disparaging remarks about the present regime. His paper was suppressed and he himself was allowed to plead sickness and to retire to a Government hospital, where he was made to pay well for his maintenance. At liberty again at the end of 1936. In charge of the Press Bureau of the Ministry of Interior in 1937. Since the fall of Reza has returned to the forefront of Tehran politics. A severe critic of Furughi and Soheily in 1942, .he worked hard for the return of Qawam-es-Saltaneh as Prime Minister. When the latter came back to power and did not make Dashti a Minister, he turned against him and criticised him in many speeches. Dashti is certainly a persuasive orator, who holds the attention of the Majlis as few other persons can do. A prime mover in the Adalat partv, he now utters the most enthusiastic praise of democracy on the British model, and evidently hopes that his past will be forgotten by us. As he appears to have much more audacity and forensic ability than most of his rivals, he may well go a good deal further than his present position as a Majlis Deputy/ Backed by the Shah as candidate for the fourteenth Majlis, 1943. 56.

Always very apprmchable and desirous of enlisting British help for his schemes; and a mine of information about the foibles of his countrymen, whom he divides into two sharply distinct categories : (1) The old gang who are hopelessly corrupt^, and (2) his party members who are sublimely honest.

Recalled temporarily in 1943 to give explanations about the conduct of Muzaffar Firuz. He survived' the ordeal and attributed the unfounded accusations against him to the enmity of Nasrullah Entezam.

He is, of course, disliked by most of the capitalists of Isfahan, though some of them accept him as a fairly single-minded man.

Then Minister of Finance in Qawam-es-Saltaneh’s Cabinet of August 1942, but resigned before its fall in circumstances which did him little credit.

Malik, Haji Hussein Agha. —Born about 1873. A large landowner of Khorassan, with properties in the Tehran summer resort of Shimran, and a noted collection of books and MSS.

A Persian and Arabic scholar, with a slight knowledge of French, Russian and English. An amiable and pleasant old man, very generous; he is now nearly deaf, and leads a retired life.

Mansur, (Rajah) Ali, C.B.E. (Mansur-ul-Mulk). —Born about 1888. Educated in the School of Political Science at Tehran. Began his career in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and was emplo/ed in the English section. He subsequently transferred to the Tribunal section, where he rose to be Director of the Civil Court.

As the result of the subsequent events he resigned in September 1941.

Consul-General at Baku in 1929. Governor of Luristan 1936. Governor of Western Azerbaijan at Reza'ieh in 1942 and again in 1943. On Soheily’s proposing him for the post of Governor- General at Tabriz the Russians objected to him as pro-Turkish. It is unlikely, however, that he is either pro-Turkish or pro-Soviet; he has seen both countries at very close -quarters and knows their peculiarities intimately. A queer-looking little man with a large bald head and a withered hand; equally at home in French, Turkish, Russian and Persian. Clever and very [ well-disposed towards us; on the other hand, his open opposition to the Russians at Reza'ieh in 1942 went a little too far. 128. Marzban (Marzuban), Dr. Ismail (Amm-ul-Mulk ).—Born about 1875, at Resht. Studied medicine in France, and has practised as an oculist at Tehran for about the last forty years. Visited London in connexion with the Constitu tional movement in 1906.

President of the Iran Club after Jam, a post which he still holds. Universally liked and respected as an honest old gentleman.

Governor-General of Fars 1922-23, and again in 1929. Arrested shortly after the fall of Firuz Mirza in 1929, and kept under surveillance near iehran lor several months. Thereafter lived quietly in Tehran till 1932, when he was allowed to return to his vast properties in and around Isfahan. Killed his own mother at his father’s instigation on a point of honour in 1906. He seems to have lived down the odium of this deed. Has been several times to Europe and has visited England. Speaks English and French fluently and is pleasant mannered, clever and intelligent. The two-fold stigma of being pro-British and a Qajar prevented him coming back to power during the regime of Reza Shah. Since the fall of Reza Shah he has continued aloof from public affairs, though he has kept in toudh with what is going on, and has now become the unofficial controller of almost everything in Isfahan. He takes a great pride in his model village at Asgharabad, near Isfahan, and may very easily have a part to play in shaping Persia’s future in the next few years. Has one surviving son, and a daughter. A famous hunter. 130. Mas'udi (Massoudi), Abbas. —Born in 1895 in Tehran. Educated in Tehran, and for a year in France. A journalist by profession and by nature. Proprietor with his brother, Jamal Massoudi, of one of the two principal vernacular daily papers in Tehran (the Ittila'at) and of the Frepch daily paper Journal de Tehran. He accompanied the present Shah, when Crown Prince, to Iraq. Syria and Egypt on his wedding tour as press representative, and kept the Tehran press supplied with a stream of accounts of the Prince’s doings, in that quasi-religious style that alone is permitted to Iranians when speaking of their monarchy. A Deputy in the eleventh and twelfth Majlis. A career in Persian journalism is a poor recommendation. In the thirteenth Majlis came out strongly in opposition to Qawam-es- Saltaneh, being severely beaten by some of his opponents in the riots of the 8th December, 1942. Visited Palestine and Egypt in May-June 1943. 131. Matin-Daftary, Dr. Ahmad. —Born in Tehran, 1898. A nephew of Dr. Musaddiq, whose daughter he has married. Educated in Tehran, partly at the American College. Entered the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1918. Persian secretary to the German Legation in Tehran 1920-23.

Member of the mission to Egypt for the Crown Prince’s marriage, February-April 1939. Prime Minister, October 1939. The Shah made him resign in June 1940, and his conduct of the various negotiations which had taken place while he was Prime Minister gave rise to a strong suspicion that he was favouring the Germans. In fact, in the speech which he made to journalists and Majlis Deputies shortly after Matin-Daftary's dismissal, Reza Shah accused him of not reporting fully to the Shah. However, it is difficult to believe this, and the reports that he connived at and failed to report certain German propaganda and fifth-column activities are difficult to believe; the Shah being an absolute autocrat, receiving detailed reports from numerous sources, it seems unlikely that any Prime Minister would risk the royal wrath by suppressing anything. He himself says it was the Shah who ordered37 him to favour the Germans. Retired into seclusion in June 1940 until two years \ later. In 1943 was evidently hoping to re-enter the political arena. Arrested as a suspect June 1943. Speaks French and German, and a little English; he has travelled in England. A very hard-working and conscientious official, always very helpful when approached. A good speaker, with a thorough knowledge of local legal administration. Has taken a leading part in the Persian League of Nations Union, being secretary of that organisation. 132.

Vice-Governor • of Isfahan 1925, where he fell out with the Governor, Nasar-ul-Mulk, who accused him of taking bribes. Governor-General of Khuzistan in 1940 and again in where he did well in asserting Government authority over hoarders and speculators. He also intervened to great effect in the elections, being successful in netting the Government candidate elected for Dasht-i-Mishun, but putting in a o-reat friend of his, Niqabat, for Abadan, in defiance of the Government’s wishes. Speaks English and French, and seems to get on well with the authorities of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company; but a man who should not be trusted too far. Very voluble and plausible. 135.

A landowner in Fars and considered a specialist in agriculture. 1929-33 head of the municipality at Shiraz. 1934-43 Deputy of the Majlis for Jahrum, and candidate for Shiraz in the elections for the 14th Majlis, 1944. An active and intriguing little man, who was of great use to Soheily in many ways; he did well as rayforteur of the Finance Commission in piloting the income-tax ’ bill through the Chamber at the end of the 13tJh Majlis. Qawam-ul-Mulk, however, considers him a venal and untrustworthy politician. 136. Muazid (Moazed), Mas‘ud {Mass(md).—^Born about 1890. Educated in the School of Political Science at Tehran.

In 1912 entered Government service and till 1927 was employed in Government offices in Ears, reaching the rank of Assistant Governor.

On the resignation or dismissal of Mirza Yahya Khan Gharagozlou from the post of Minister of Education in June 1933, Dr. Muhsini became acting Minister of Education. In this post he was not a success, being old-fashioned and conservative in his methods. The Cabinet resigned in September 1933; and Dr. Muhsini was relegated to the comparatively unimportant post of Governor of Kermanshah in the following November. Relieved of his duties at Kermanshah July 1935, since when he has been in retirement at Tehran. Dr. Muhsini is rather a wind-bag with a great sense of his own importance. Married to a daughter of Mirza Suleiman Khan Meykedeh, and therefore has many connexions with the Germans; nevertheless always makes a parade of his pro-British feelings. He made a good deal of money when in England by teaching and translating, and he evidently looks back with pleasure on his stay there. Speaks English. 140.

Then served under the Sipahbud in Luristan; and then in Kuhgilu. Returned to Ahwaz in December 1930 as General Officer Commanding the Khuzistan Brigade; promoted to Brigadier-General (Sartip) in 1933, and Major-General (Sarlashkar) in 1938. An energetic and forceful personality, who since 1930 has taken a very prominent part in the affairs of Khuzistan, and has been the leading and most influential personality of Ahwaz. He is extremely hardworking in training his troops and in the administration of his charge. He has seen a good deal of actual fighting in Persia and is proud of a bullet-wound through his ear. Very popular with officers and men who serve under him. At Ahwaz has a finger in every pie, civilian or military. Said to be a favourite of Reza Shah.

On the fall of Reza Shah in September 1941 he retired to Kerman, and then to Kermanshah, but was summoned to Tehran and tried on charges of compassing the death of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, Mudarris, Nusrat-ed-Douleh and others. The trial attracted a great deal of attention and Mukhtar was eventually sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment, though he very naturally argued in his own defence that whatever he had done had been under the direct orders of Reza Shah. He was, no doubt, an efficient and very obedient Chief of Police, and the popular indignation which was vented upon him was almost entirely an expression of the pent-up feelings of resentment against the oppression of Reza Shah. 142. Mukri, Murteza. —Born about 1882. A military officer. During the 1914^18 war was engaged on intelligence duties on the Russian frontier. Acting Governor-General, Khorassan 1924—27.

Being an old friend of Reza Shah he was retained in the army and in June 1942 was made Governor-General of Azerbaijan, on account of his local knowledge and alleged ability to get on with the Russians. However, being himself a land- owner in the district he became involved in all sorts of chicanery concerning his wheat, and failed to produce the much-needed grain for Tehran. He was also accused of giving in to the Russians about the election candidates and other matters,, and was summoned to Tehran in May and finally dismissed in August 1943; he appears to have resisted for some time the order to report to Tehran : instead of obeying he retired to his estates near Karagheh. Muqaddam gives the impression of being a clever though cautious old soldier, unable to resist the temptation to make money whenever possible. His daughter is married to Reza Qawam, son of Qawam-ul-Mulk. 145. Musaddiq, Dr. Muhammad (Musaddiq-us-Saltaneh). —Born about 1885; a nephew of Farrnan Farma.

Appointed Minister of Finance in November 1929, but resigned in April 1930, having found that the interference of the Minister of Court in financial administration rendered his position untenable. He is a man of common sense and intelligence. As Minister for Foreign Affairs, he showed himself very friendly to His Majesty’s Legation, and used his best endeavours for the settlement of outstanding questions. He is not popular with many of his compatriots in high places owing to his straightforward character and outspokenness. In 1931 he was appointed steward of the Royal estates in Mazanderan, a post which appears to have occupied all his energies till 1935.

As there appears little likelihood that he could ever return to Persia after his record of oppression and misrule, and at the age of over 70, all that is necessary to record is that he remains hale and hearty in his exile in Johannesburg. His son, the present ruler, retains a warm filial regard for his father and pays him the compliment of imitating him as much as possible; he also initiates propaganda in favour of Reza, but it is not taken seriously. 166. Pahlavi, Shah Muhammad Reza .—The eldest son of Reza Shah by the daughter of Teymour Khan; this lady was the ex-Shah’s chief consort and was known as the “ Malikeh.” Born on the 26th October, 1919, and proclaimed Vali-ahd, or heir-apparent, on the 1st January, 1926. Educated in Tehran under tutors at first, and then in Switzerland at La Rosey, under the direction of Dr. Moadeb Naficy. Returned to Persia in the spring of 1936. Extremely keen on football and other sports. Speaks excellent French and good English. Betrothed in June 1938, and married Princess Fowzieh, sister of King Farouk of Egypt, at Cairo on the 15th March, 1939. The marriage was preceded by a very pompous journey through Iraq, Syria and Egypt. The principal wedding festivities took place in Tehran in April, on the couple’s arrival, and were attended by delegations from many countries, including the Earl of Athlone and Her Royal Highness Princess Alice, the Duke of Spoleto and General Weygand. The only offspring so far is one daughter, Shahnaz, born in 1940. The Shah succeeded to the throne, on the abdication of his father, in September 1941. He has fulfilled the duties of his office with distinction and charm, though it is as yet too early to say whether he will be able to establish the Pahlavi dynasty on a permanent basis in the face of the reaction against Reza Shah which was such a remarkable feature of what are now called, the “ events of 1941.” He speaks well and makes a good impression on visitors. On the other hand he is determined to interpret literally the provision of the Constitution which says that the Shah is the commander of the armed forces, and has hitherto delegated little if any responsibility in army matters to the Minister for War. As yet he has no male heir and he has not yet declared any of his brothers to be the “ Vali-ahd ” or next in succession to the throne. His attitude in the riots of the 8th December, 1942, and in the re-shuffle of Soheily’s Cabinet in December 1943, showed him to be on the one hand prone to listen to the advice of worthless subordinated, and on the other hand deter mined to emulate his father and (in the reported words of Stalin to him at the Tehran Conference of November-December 1943) ” be a King in fact as well as in name.” His admiration for his father, and the influence of his bitterly anti- British mother; must both tend to make him believe the theory which his mother instils into him, that the British expelled Reza Shah, whereas in actual fact the i latter abdicated at the advance of Russian troops on Tehran. 167.

Has also been in charge of the passport section. Consul-General at liflis 1934. Returned to Tehran 1936. Head of the Minister’s Oftice at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs 1937 until 1938. Counsellor in Kabul 1941. Speaks a little French. Always very friendly, but many years of coping with the cyphers of the Ministry have blunted the edge of his intelligence. 169 Pakravan, Fathullah (Amir-i-Arfa'). —Born about 1885. First became known as a member of the second Majlis, where it appears that he was the laughing-stock of his colleagues. In 1910 he obtained the appointment ot Pei sian consul-general in Constantinople, although he had had no previous career in any Government Department. From Constantinople he went to Egypt as consul-general, and later became Persian Minister there until he returned to lehran early in 1925 In 1925 he was appointed Director of the Russian and lurkish section m the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The .Soviet Embassy objected to this appointment at first, on the score that Pakravan, having been ma ^ year V n u £ yP ^’ was P robabl y a Britisb agent. Finally, the Soviet Embassy withdrew its objection, and Pakravan became persona grata with the Russians so much that when Ansari became Minister for Foreign Affairs in July 1926 the boviet Embassy asked that Pakravan be appointed Under-Secretary He duly received this appointment, and was in charge of the Ministry during Ansari’s absence in Moscow until he was appointed Persian Minister in Rome in December Wben be assumed charge of the Foreign Ministry, the first impression he nroved ed hb^ S an a g reeable and conscientious young man, but closer contact proved him to be a garrulous nonentity. Teymourtache exercised a close twp 18 ! 1011 ° Ver mat ^ ers relating to the Foreign Ministry, and it was evident that Pakravan carried no weight, and was but a figurehead. Teymourtache was at no pains to hide the fact that he considered Pakravan merely an amiable fool Interviews with him were mere waste of time, and during the twenty months that he was in charge of the Ministry affairs remained at a standstill. f Appointed Persian Ambassador to the U.b.S.R. in February 1931. Was accredited also to Finland and Estonia as Minister in 1932.

He was chosen as piesi ent for the whole terms of the third and fourth Parliaments and for the grea er pait of the fifth term and for half of the sixth term, and he showed nimself to be firm and impartial. Has not come back to politics since the fall of Reza Shah, though he is often | men icned in terms of extravagant praise as the most honest man, if not the oil y lonest man, in Persia. He refused to form a Government on the fall of the t^awam-es-Saltaneh Government in February 1943, in spite of the insistent request of the Deputies; and similarly refused to be head of the Committee of ?n-P e u V1S10n , ±or Tehran elections to the Majlis in 1943.

Governor of Kermanshah in 1897- of Zinjan in 1899 aaid 1900, and of Arabistan from 1901 to 1904, where he married the daughter of a local chief. Fled from Tehran to Luristan in April 1904 but was brought back and appointed Governor of Kurdistan in 1905. Collected tribesmen from Luristan and rebelled against Muhammad Ali Shah in June 1907. A fight occurred in that month between his followers and the Shah’s troops outside Nihavend. He was defeated and took refuge at the British consulate at Kermanshah, but was handed over to the Persian authorities under a promise of personal safety. Thereafter he was placed under surveillance and was considered mentally deranged. Expelled to Europe after couv d'Etat of 1908. f ^ Entered Persia again in May 1911 from the direction of Bagdad. In the following July he seized the capital of Kurdistan and advanced on Kermanshah Having arrived there he collected a large force of Lurs, including the Kalhur tribe, and marched on Tehran via Sultanabad. Bakhtiaris and Armenian irregulars were sent against him and inflicted a severe defeat on him near Nubaran in September 1911. He then retreated to Luristan and was again defeated in November 1911. Having been at large in Kermanshah and Kurdistan for some time, he suddenly appeared near Tehran and threatened, but did not actually attack, the capital. He then betook himself to Asterabad whence, with the assistance of Russian influence, he carried on negotiations with the Persian Government to be appointed Governor of Gilan. After some further adventures he was persuaded to leave Persia with a pension from the Persian Government and resided in Switzerland till 1918. In that year he formed a project to enter Persia through Transcaspia and raise a revolt in the Asterabad district. He was caught by a British detachment in about December 1918 before crossing the Persian frontier, and was sent via48 Kazvin to Bagdad where he was interned till the following autumn, when he was again allowed to return to Switzerland. He slipped over the Iraq-Persian frontier in June 1926 somehow avoiding the Iraq police authorities. His presence caused considerable embarrassment to the new Pahlavi Government who realised that Salar, however mad, was a possible rallying point for the forces of reaction. However, after fruitless negotiations with various Kurdish chiefs, during which he contracted marriage^ with the daughters of some of them, he left Persia in the autumn of 1926. The Persian Government from that date paid him a subsidy of 1,500 rials per month from secret funds up to September 1933. Salar was persuaded to settle down at Haifa after having given an ambiguous promise to behave himself. On the cessation of his subsidy in 1933 he was informed by British authorities that he was free to do what he liked. In 1935 living at Alexandria, where he has employed lawyers to press his claims against His Majesty’s Government. Speaks French. Scatter-brained and under-sized. Still reported to be at Alexandria 1943; has not attempted to return to Persia after Reza Shah’s fall; but his two sons, who have been living in penury at Tehran for many years, are now trying to get back some of the family properties. 175. Qaraguzlu, All Reza (Baha-vl-Mulk). —Born about 1880. Owns property at Hamadan, and is a cousin of the late Nasir-ul-Mulk. Has lived in Europe for a number of years and is a graduate of the School of Political Sciences of Paris. Elected to the fourth Majlis as member for Hamadan. Appointed Minister of Finance in 1923, though he had held no Government office before. Resigned in April 1923, as he found that he was controlled by Dr. Millspaugh. President of the Government Supervisorv Board of the National Bank of Persia 1929-32. Minister of Justice in Qawam-es-Saltaneh’s Cabinet of August 1942; resigned in the following January without having accomplished anything valuable. An honest politician, but much too old to learn anything new or useful. Lives in Tehran; used frequently to visit Paris. A queer and eccentric man, with a reputation for honesty. 176. Qaraguzlu, Hussein AH .—Second and younger son of the late Nasir-ul- Mulk, Regent of Persia. Born in 1900. Educated at Harrow and Balliol College, Oxford. Married the daughter of Teymourtache in 1931; and divorced her in 1935. An attache at the Legation in London 1931. In the same capacity at Paris 1932. Returned to Tehran at the end of that year, and since employed in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, at first in the ■ Treaty Department, and from the end of 1936 in the Protocol Department. Transferred to the Ministry of Interior at the end of 1937. Resigned from Government service in 1938 and took to chicken farming. After the fall of Reza Shah was not employed in Government service until he became secretary to Dr. Millspaugh at the end of 1942; and in May 1943 was employed at Court, his brother-in-law, Ala, being Minister of Court. Charming but ineffective; his failure to fulfil his early promise has been a disappointment. Speaks perfect English and French. 177. Nizam-Qaraguzlu, Hussein Quli {Amir Nizam ).—Born in 1883, the eldest son of the late Amir Nizam. A member of the Qaragozlu family of Hamadan and a nephew of the late Regent, Nasir-ul-Mulk. Educated ' in England and Austria. Passed through the Military Academy at Vienna, and served with a commission in an Austrian infantry regiment for three years. Inherited large estates from his father in the district of Hamadan, but owing to his absence in Europe from 1921 to 1929 these estates have been allowed to deteriorate. Was appointed Governor of Kermanshah by Vossuq in 1919, where he was very popular on account of his honesty and integrity. Being a rich man he was imprisoned at the time of the cowp d’Etat in 1921, and made to pay 20,000 tomans as the price of his release. He was so disgusted at this unmerited treatment that he left Persia and vowed never to return. During his stay in Europe he lost heavily at Monte Carlo and Deauville. Teymourtache met him in Europe in 1928, and persuaded him to return to Persia, which he did in 1929. Appointed Grand Master of Ceremonies at the Court in March 1929. Sent to Europe on private business for the Shah in March 1930 and returned at the end of December. A reputation for honesty saved him from sharing his friend Teymourtache’s fall. Grand Master of Court Ceremonies (Foreign) 1938. Dismissed owing toroyal irritability during the Crown Prince’s wedding celebrations in April 1939, and. retired to his estate at Kabud-Rahang, near Hamadan. An extremely agreeable and likeable man, with more than a veneer of European culture. Is the best type of educated Persian, and is noted for his honesty and integrity. Speaks fluently French, German and English. 178. Qaraguzlu, Muhsin. —Eldest son of the late Nasir-ul-Mulk, Regent of ^Persia. Born about 1895. Spent about fourteen years in Europe with his late father, and received most of his education there. Elected a member of the seventh and eighth Majlis for Hamadan. Appointed Court Chamberlain when his brother-in-law, Ala, was Minister of Court at the end of 1942; accompanied the Pahlavi Princesses on various visits to Cairo. Well-disposed but lazy. Charming manners, but neither energetic nor useful. Speaks English and French. Unmarried. 179. Qaraguzlu, Taqi. —Born in Hamadan about 1891. The youngest brother of Ali Reza Qaragozlu. Educated in France. Owns large properties round Hamadan. Employed in the A.P.O.C. office at Paris 1928-29. Entered the service of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1929 and sent to Rome as secretary. Returned two years later. Deputy Master of Ceremonies at the Court in 1934. Speaks French and. English. A handsome man with charming manners; pleasant, but ineffective. 180. Qashqai, Ali (Salar Hishmat). —Born 1889. Son of a former Ilbegi of the Qashqai tribe. Half-brother to the late Ismail Khan Soulat-ud-Douleh and full brother to the late Ahmad Khan Sardar Ihtisham. Appointed Ilbegi by the Farman Farma in 1918, he thereafter sided with the British troops against their inveterate enemy Saulat-ud-Douleh. Gave up the Ilbegiship in September 1920. In 1922 resided in Eastern Fars, where his followers committed certain depredations. In the following year he lived in Shiraz, claiming the restoration of certain villages seized by his half-brother, but got no redress. In 1929 he took an active part in the Qashqai rebellion, leading the Qashqai tribesmen in their revolt against their Military Governor. With a small band of followers he remained for the most part at Siyakh, south of Shiraz, while other khans were treating with the Government forces. Through the influence of Soulat-ud-Douleh the anti-Government movement fizzled out, but Ali Khan remained more or less actively in opposition to the Government, acting as a centre of the many recalcitrants. A force of 500 troops was sent from Shiraz to round him up in 1932; it does not appear, however, that he was defeated in battle. In 1933 he came to Tehran, having come to terms with the Government; he is believed to have been given a safe-conduct in return for a promise of good behaviour. Allowed to come to Tehran from Kerman at end of 1942; and sent to Shiraz to help the Government troops in their campaign against the Qashqais in June 1943, in return for which he hoped to recover his family estates in Fars. He has the reputation of being the most courageous of his family in the field. However, he has no talent for organisation and administration; in fact, according to most observers, he is scatter-brained and foolish. 181. Qashqai, Muhammad Nasir. —Born about 1895. The eldest son of the late Ismail Qashqai (Soulat-ed-Douleh). Elected to the eighth Majlis as a member for the Qashqai tribes. Ilkhani of those tribes for a short time during 1930. Deprived of parliamentary immunity and arrested for conspiracy September 1932. Fled from Tehran during the general disorder in September 1941, and since then has been at large in the south of Persia, carrying on a wordy warfare with his own Government about the return of his lands and restitution for his wrongs. At the same time he has seized all the lands he can lay hands on with the help'of his tribesmen and endeavours, through the agency of friends in the Majlis and elsewhere (such as the notorious Nawbakht), to make himself out to be a very patriotic and well-intentioned person. Having expressed fears lest we might be against him by way of revenge for the deeds of his father, our great enemy in the last war, Soulat-ed-Douleh, His Majesty’s Minister sent to him a document assuring him that we had nothing against him provided he submitted to his own Government. It seems certain that he had two Germans with him in 1943 and that he made a landing-ground intended for German aeroplanes near Farrash- [52—42] H50 band. Attacked by troops under Marshal Shahbakliti in May 1943, but the operations were very half-hearted and soon fizzled out. His youngest brother, Khosro, is actively assisting him in his intransigent attitude. Two other brothers, Malik Mansour and Ahmed, were in Germany at the outbreak of war but were in Stamboul at the end. of 1943. Observers before his escape in 1941 considered him reasonable and intelligent, but he now seems as cunning and unreliable as his anti-British father. Speaks English. 1 182. Qawam, Ibrahim (Qawam-ul-Mulk ).—Born 1888. The son of Murza Habibullah Khan Qawam-ul-Mulk, who was killed accidentally in May 1916. During the war of 1914-18 was very friendly to us, and carried on his father’s traditional policy of opposition to the powerful Qashqai group of tribes headed by the late Ismail Khan Soulat-ud-Douleh. Having inherited vast properties in Ears from his father, as well as the titular headship of the “ Arab ” tribes of that province, he wielded immense authority in the south of Persia at the time of the cowp d’Etat of 1921. Reza Khan (late Reza Shah) when Minister for War met the Qawam at Isfahan in August 1923 and expressed a wish that he should reside at Tehran; he therefore became elected to the Majlis as member for the Khamseh (Arab) tribes and thereafter has resided a good, deal in Tehran. Always on terms of close friendship with His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, the Qawam engaged in 1926 a British agricultural expert to develop his vast estates; the experiment proved a failure through local opposition and the Qawam’s stinginess; the British expert left in 1928. In 1929 fled to Europe, doubtless having foreseen the Qashqai revolts of that year. Visited London 1929. Returned to Tehran the following year, having put his two boys to school at Beirut. His vast properties were left in the hands of his servants, who remitted him a monthly subvention. In 1929 various questions of validity of title to property were raised by the Ministry of Finance; and in 1931 the whole question was settled by the exchange of lands. The Qawam was given crown lands in Nishapur, in the neighbourhood of Tehran, and elsewhere in the centre of Persia, in exchange for his Ears properties. It is believed that he did well out of these transactions, and that he is one of the wealthiest landowners of Persia at present. In the ninth Majlis of 1933 he was a Deputy for Baluchistan. He had also accompanied Reza Shah on several of his journeys, and was generally supposed to enjoy His Majesty’s full confidence. In November 1933, however, on the arrest of the Minister of War, Sardar Asad, while in attendance on the Shah at the Turcoman races, the Qawam seems to have become the object of suspicion, and he was placed under arrest with Asad. He is an attractive personality to meet. Very pro-British in sentiment, he sent his two sons (Ali Muhammad Qawam and Muhammad Reza Qawam) to England to be educated. Until his arrest he appeared to have settled down permanently as a peaceful courtier at Tehran. He plays polo, but does not mix much in society. Quiet in voice and retiring in manner, he is yet capable of driving a very hard bargain with his own countrymen. He does not appear to have much ambition. Though his name is still a household word at Shiraz, he cannot be considered a tribal leader in the sense that the Qashqai chiefs are; he is best considered as a Persian noble whose family had for some time held suzerainty over a group of tribes and who attained great wealth and influence in Ears, partly through backing the right side in the 1914 war. His son, Ali Muhammad, married Princess Ashraf Pahlavi in March 1937, but the marriage was dissolved. He had previously been an undergraduate at Bristol University, where he did very badly. A daughter married Assadullah ‘Alam, son of Muhammad Ibrahim ‘Alam (Shaukat) in 1939. Played his part in the “events of 1941 ”; he and his family at one time “ took bast ” in the British Legation at Gulhek; and when Reza Shah abdicated and went to Isfahan it was Qawam who was sent by the Government to obtain Reza’s signature to documents handing over his properties and private fortune to the State and to his son respectively. Visited India 1941-42 and bought a house at Bangalore. Sent back to Shiraz to help Marshal Shahbakhti with his attack on the Qashqais in June 1943. x His elder son, Ali Muhammad, went to Washington as Assistant Military Attache at the end of 1941. , y Appointed Governor-General of Ears September 1943. but could not agree with any of the military chiefs about tribal policy, and returned to Tehran November 1943, still holding the office of Governor-General.183. Qavam (Ghavam), A timed {Qawam-us-Scdtaneh). —A brother of Hassan Vossuq, than whom he is younger by a few years. Began his career in the Ministry of Finance. Became Minister of War, July to October 1910, and Minister of Interior, July to November 1911, and again in December 1911. Minister of finance, July to August 1914, and Minister of Interior, November 1917 to January 1918. Appointed Governor-General of Khorassan April 1918 and ^ remained there for three years, during which he administered the province with uniform success during troublous times. Became Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, June 1921 to January 1922, and again Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs from June 1922 to February 1923. Banished to Europe in October 1923, being accused of having plotted against the life of Reza Khan (Reza Shah). Was allowed to return to Tehran at the end of 1928 and arrived in March 1929, when he went to reside quietly on his property at Lahijan near Resht. Came back to live in Tehran after the fall of Reza Shah. Prime Minister, August 1942, after the fall of Soheily. Worked hard, but gradually surrounded himself with his own relations and friends. Tried hard to gain control of the Ministry of War, but failed to counteract the young Shah’s enthusiasm for the control of the army. The Shah’s opposition to him was shown in the disturbances of the 8th December, 1942, in which Qavam did extremely well and undoubtedly performed a great public service in re-establishing governmental authority. Thereafter, however, he became more and more involved in petty intrigues and favouritism, and had to resign in February 1943; since when he has been more or less openly accused, of being the real instigator of the riots of December 1942. Seems really to be too old-fashioned and unbending to adapt himself to the changed political life of to-day. Believed to have been in touch with the Japanese Legation early in 1942, and to have received, when Prime Minister in 1942, messages from persons whom he knew to be German agents, without informing us This was brought to the notice of the Shah in January 1944. A clever man, but sly, intriguing and unreliable. Has generally been friendly to His Majesty’s Embassy. Speaks a little French. 184. Quds (Ghodse), Hussein. —Born about 1892. Graduate of the Tehran School of Political Science. Has held various posts under the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and was secretary in London for five years.

Secretary in London March 1937. Consul, Izmir, 1939. Counsellor in London early 1943. Speaks English and French. A quiet and level-headed official. 185. Raf'uti (Raffety), Hussein. —Born about 1906. Educated mostly in England.; studied at London University and acquired an Oxford accent. An instructor at the Officers’ College. Very thrilled with his English education and anxious to return to England whenever possible. A solid and capable man. Interested principally in literature. 186.

Shahbakhti, General Muhammad. —Born about 1882, the son of a peasant inhabiting the village of Ishtihar, near Tehran, but has now been heard to describe himself as a native of Azerbaijan, possibly to cover up his humble origin. He enlisted in the Cossack Brigade about 1901, distinguished himself by bravery in the field, and received a commission. In 1914 he was a captain. He attached himself to Reza Khan, whose influence with General Starosselsky secured him promotion to the rank of colonel in 1919. After the coup d'Etat of 1921 he was appointed to command the Ahan regiment of infantry. In 1925 he was promoted general and given command of an infantry brigade in Tehran. In 1926 tie was sent to command the Western Division, but was recalled in the spring of 1928 for corruption; he, however, managed to ingratiate himself with the Shah, and was appointed shortly afterwards to command the Persian troops in Kurdistan.

Shaibani, General Habibullah. about 1885, the son of Nazm-ed- Dowleh, who came of a middle-class family of Kashan. In 1906 Shaibani went to Saint-Cyr, where he graduated in 1910 and joined a rench regpment Returned to Persia in 1913. and was commissioned into the Swedish officered gendarmerie as a captain. He was highly regarded by the Swedish officers and was promoted major in 1914.

In 1930 he commanded the operations in the Mamasenni district and against the Kuhgelus, and by October he had succeeded in reducing the Kuhgelus, only one of the khans still refusing to make his submission to the Government. Shaibani is a man of independent views, and is somewhat rigid and narrow minded. He is a strict disciplinarian, and does not play to the gallery. His military ideas are conservative and sound, and he is perhaps the only French- trained officer who has not been led away from the realisation of realities. He regards Russia as the enemy of Persia; of the motives underlying British policy he has a fair understanding, and he thinks that Britain can and should help Persia in her own interests, but he believes that Britain will always sacrifice Persia if it should be in her interest to do so. He is intensely patriotic, and will stoutly oppose whatever he considers to be derogatory to Persian sovereignty or detrimental to Persian independence. At the same time he views with disfavour Persia’s hasty efforts to play the role of a civilised nation. He is remarkably honest, direct in speech, and prompt in action. He has little sympathy with Persian officialdom. His nickname in the army is “ Feranghi,” not by reason of any imitation of Europeans, but rather because of the un-Persian nature of his character. He speaks French fluently. Tried by a military court-martial in the autumn of 1931, on a charge of military inefficiency in his 1930 operations against the Mamasenni and the Boir Ahmedi tribes, resulting in some 500 Persian casualties.

His Cabinet fell in July 1942, partly owing to lack of support from the Court and the army. Again Prime Minister on the fall of Qawam-es- Saltaneh in February 1943, once more unexpectedly; this time it was largely because Mu’tamin-ul-Mulk could not stand and the Majlis did not want the Shah’s candidate, Saed. Proved himself once more a hard worker, but carried little weight in the country and had to maintain himself by various “ combinations ” and political deals with Majlis Deputies. A very reasonable, matter-of-fact person, with a businesslike manner. Hard working, and a good deal more approachable than some of his colleagues. In his contacts with this Legation he has always given the impression of his willingness to help and to arrive at reasonable settlements. Has a Caucasian wife with a “ past,” and is universally suspected of having taken a great many bribes. 218. Sur, Qasim (formerly Sur-i-Israfil). —^Born in Tehran about 1880. The son of Haji Mirza Hassan Khan Mustaufi. Editor of the paper Sur-i-Israfil during the period of the first Majlis.

Recalled in 1927 and offered a post as a judge in the High Court of Appeal, but did not accept it. Speaks French. Said to be intelligent and hard-working. Was more or less under arrest for about ten years in Tehran until the fall of Reza Shah 1941. Gradually entered political life after that and initiated and fostered the only Liberal party of Persia, called the “ Millat ” party (“ The Nation ”). In his old age has become very garrulous, but is shrewd, and is one of the few Persiai^ politicians who tries to bridge the gap between the die-hard Conservatives and the young socialistic hot-heads. Head of the Election Committee for Tehran 1943-44, and himself elected Deputy. Aspires to becoming Prime Minister, but, though intelligent, has ruined his health by excessive opium-smoking. 222. Tabatabai, Seyyid Zia-ud-Din .—'Born about 1893. Son of the late Seyyid Ali Yazdi Tabatabai. Edited the newspaper Rad {Thunder) in Tehran in 1915-16. Played a considerable political role in 1917-18. Sent to Baku by Vosuq-ud-Dowleh in 1919 as Persian representative to Caucasian Azerbaijan; returned to Tehran in May 1920. Carried out coup d'fitat with the help of the Cossacks in February 1921, and seized the reins of office. Appointed Prime Minister with full powers by Ahmed Shah on the 1st March, 1921, and effected numerous arrests. His reforms were too radical for the country and the time, and he fell from power in June, fleeing the country. He has been in the tobacco business while exiled. Took a prominent part in the Pan-Islamic Congress at Jerusalem in 1933. Said to have assisted Kazemi in the negotiations with Iraq at Geneva during 1935. In 1942, being by that time the owner of a very prosperous farm near Chazza in Palestine, which he had developed himself, he began to think of returning to his native country, and Muzaffar Firuz began with great energy and indiscretion to run a newspaper campaign in his favour in Tehran. He published a letter from the Seyyid in which the Russians were praised in fulsome language. His name came forward a good deal in the Tehran press during 1943, and quite a number of Deputies in the 13th Majlis seem to have favoured his return. The Russians and the Shah, however, were steadfastly opposed to his return, the former because they mistrusted Firuz’s unfortunate letter, and the latter through fear that the Seyyid might become a dictator. However, he returned to Tehran in September 1943 and was elected to the 14th Majlis from Yezd, his native place. Caused annoyance by insisting on wearing a woollen hat of Caucasian style, and alienated some of his friends by an appearance of stubborn ness and obstinacy. But he may yet have a part to play in controlling Persia’s destinies. Speaks French and English. Has something of the mystic in him. 223. Tadayun, Seyyid Muhammad .—Born about 1884, a native of Birjand in East Persia; educated m Tehran, where he graduated and became a schoolmaster. After the split up of the original Democrat party in 1912, Tadayun became the leader of one of the more important Democrat factions. He was elected a Deputy from Tehran to the fourth term of the Majlis, and from Birjand to the fifth and sixth terms. Was elected President of the Majlis in the second half of the fifth term, and again at the beginning of the sixth term. In February 1927 he was appointed Minister of Education, but in December he resigned that appointment owing to disagreement with his colleagues in the Cabinet, but he resumed office nine days later at the personal request of the Shah. On the 7th January, 1928, the Shah ordered him to resign, and his fall was said to be due to the personal animosity towards him of Teymourtache, who even vetoed his candidature as a Deputy to the seventh term of the Majlis. In June 1930 he was appointed Governor of Kerman, and appears to have recovered the Royal favour to a certain extent. Tadayun was one of the principal supporters of the Republican movement in 1924, and is said to have appropriated to himself a large part of the funds put at his disposal for the realisation of that object. As President of the Majlis he was a success, being impartial and strict in upholding the rules of the House. He is undoubtedly an intelligent man, and has a very pleasant manner. He knows a little French. He was recalled from Kerman in March 1931, and he appears to believe that one reason for his recall was the fact that he was too friendly withLieutenant-Colonel Noel, then British consul. However, he appears to nourish no anti-British grievance on that score. Returned to politics on the fall of Reza Shah; was Minister of Education in heroughi s Cabinet of 1941-42, and spoke eloquently in favour of the tripartite treaty of 1942. Minister of Food after Farrukh in 1942; resigned in July 1943, becoming a Minister of State. Minister of the Interior September 1943, and did well in running the elections. But was not included in the reshuffled Cabinet of December 1943. The Russians, who for some reason are against him, seem to have secured his exclusion. 224. Taheri, Dr. Hadi .—Born at Yezd about 1888. Son of a mulla. Land- owner and proprietor of various concerns at Yezd. A great rival of the Nawwab family of Yezd. Elected to the Majlis on various occasions, and has served as president of the Financial Commission of the Majlis. In the 13th Majlis was one of the vice-presidents and was considered one of the leading members of the Majlis. Served on the Committee of the Anglo-Iranian Relief Fund, 1943, and was helpful in providing local knowledge. Was largely responsible for the success of Seyyid Zia-ed-Din in the Yezd elections of 1943, thereby incurring the dislike and distrust of the Shah. Very friendly to us. Accused of various peculations at Yezd, but nothing has been proved, and he is considered one of the most solid and reliable Deputies. 225. Tajbakhsh, Mehdi Quli .—'Born about 1885.

He was educated in his native town, and used to haunt the booksellers’ shops, where he showed great eagerness to acquire knowledge. In his early youth he was an ardent Nationalist, and was connected with the Nationalist movement in Persia from the beginning. He was elected to the first term of the Majlis and was one of its most prominent members. Mohammad Ali Shah hated and feared him, and, when the Shah made a coup d’Etat in 1908 against the Majlis, Taqizadeh took refuge in His Majesty’s Legation. The demand made by the Shah that he should be given up was refused, and Taqizadeh was eventually amnestied, on the condition that he went to Europe. He visited London and Cambridge, but returned to Tabriz at the end of 1908. He was elected to the second term of the Majlis in 1909, and, after the capture of Tehran by the Nationalist forces and the abdication of Muhammad Ali Shah in July 1909, Taqizadeh became a prominent member of the Nationalist Committee, which was set up to decide on the Government of the country. Went to Europe in 1910. He was elected in his absence to the third and fourth terms of the Majlis, but did not take his seat. He stayed in Europe and America during the whole period from 1914 to 1923, and was for years in Berlin, where he edited a paper called Kaveh. For publishing certain articles of an anti-Islamic nature he was excommunicated by the Mujtehids. He negotiated the Perso-Soviet Commercial Treaty in Moscow in February 1921, and'finally returned to Persia in 1924. He was elected to the fifth term of the Majlis 1924r-26, and to the sixth term in 1926. He visited America again in 1926 as Persian delegate to the Philadelphia Exhibition. Appointed Governor-General of Khorasan in January 1929; he was recalled in May and appointed Persian Minister in London, where he remained until April 1930, when he returned to Persia and became Minister of Roads and Communications. In August 1930 he was appointed Minister of Finance, in addition. Taqizadeh is a well-bred man, and has travelled extensively. He is no longer so notably popular as he was in the early days of the Constitution, and the years have tempered his excessive energy and zeal. His speeches in the Majiis marked him as a man of common sense and moderation, and were in sharp contrast to the utterances of the former fiery young Nationalist. Taqizadeh fell from grace in September 1933, for reasons which are obscure. The Shah is said to have suspected him of intrigue with Majlis members inconnexion with the purchase of gold. He was, however, soon re-employed, as he proceeded to Paris as Minister in December 1933. Recalled from Paris in August 1934, but obtained prolonged leave of absence and did not return to Persia. Appointed Iranian representative at the Congress of Orientalists at Rome in September 1935. But an article which he wrote for the official Journal of the Ministry of Public Instruction, in which he said the^ revision of the Persian language must proceed gradually and without the use of^ force, annoyed the Shah and caused the suppression of the paper. He is married to a German, and talks German fluently. He speaks English and French less well. Appointed Minister in London by Feroughi 1941, and has been suggested as Prime Minister on more than one occasion since then, but he has always preferred to stay in London.

He became unpopular over the Anglo- Persian Convention, but, after a most able and convincing defence of his acts as Prime Minister during the period 1918-20 before the Majlis, he regained a large measure of popularity. Still has some bitter enemies, who seem to have prevented him from acquiring the favour of Reza Shah. Went to Europe for a serious operation 1940; survived it, and is now reported to be living in Switzerland (1943), unable to return to Persia; he was appointed ambassador to Turkey by his brother Qawam-es-Saltaneh in 1942. but could not proceed.

During the whole of his service he was intimate with Reza Khan, and accompanied him on the march to Tehran in February 1921 which culminated in the cou'p d’Etat. Was promoted general and given command of the Central Division. In July 1927 he fell from favour, and was put under arrest for a short time for an unknown reason. Whatever the suspicions against him were, they appear to have been unsubstantiated, for he was released very soon. In the autumn of 1928 he was appointed inspector of the gendarmerie, but was superseded in 1930 and left without any active command. Murteza Khan was always regarded until 1927 as a very loyal supporter of Reza Shah, but after his arrest in 1927 he appeared to have lost confidence in Reza Shah. He is active, intelligent, ambitious, and a strict disciplinarian. His military ideas and his general education are very limited, but he has shown anxiety to learn. He is not popular amongst the troops, but is feared and respected. Holds aloof from foreigners, and is a stron'g opponent of foreign interference in Persia. Inspector of Infantry in 1932. Commandant of Tehran Cadet College, 1933. On the fall of Reza Shah, Murteza Khan came again to the fore. He soon became Chief of the General Staff, and gradually worked as a loyal supporter of the young Shah. On the appointment of Amir Ahmedi as Minister of War in 1943 it became apparent that the two could not work together, and Murteza’s department became quite separate from that of the Minister of War; in fact, the Shah took to giving orders to the Chief of the Staff without the knowledge of the responsible Minister. Murteza took two months’ leave in June 1943, but was soon appointed commander of the Tehran garrison. On the whole, was a disappoint ment, and was suspected of having sold himself to the Germans.

I cannot yet appreciate the effect on the political situation of Prime Minister's formation of a new party. 2. It is however noteworthy that his broadcast coincided with a declaration by Tudeh and Persian parties announcing formation of a •’united front of freedom lovers” to overcome the reactionary and combative influence of imperialism in Persia. iJavam’s initiative cannot fail to take a lot of wind out of the sails of this 11 freedom front”. 3.

P, &amp; .f/T &amp; * 0 -13 2. A fshar, Reza. Born at Urumieh (now Reza'iyeh) about 1888. Joined the Ministry of Finance as a young man, and during Mirza Kuehik Khan’s rebellion in Gilan acted as financial agent to him; and soon after the war he got away with certain funds from the Finance (M&amp;ce in Resht. With these he bought carpets and them to America for sale. Served also under Sir P. Cox, who paid him well. Returned to Persia in 1921, full of American ideas and education. Joined the staff of Dr. Millspaugh, the American financial adviser. A staunch supporter of the Pahlevi regime; elected to the 5th 6th and 7th Majlis. Opposed Firuz Mirza when the latter was Minister of Finance. Governor of Gilan in 1929. While at that post he organised the Gilan Import and Export Company, which was founded in opposi tion to Russian trade monopoly methods. As a result he incurred the hostility of the Russian interests there. Governor-General of Kerman in 1981. Minister of Roads in February 1932. Resigned in the following July, being unable to build the Chalus road fast enough for the Shah. Governor of Isfahan September 1932 to December 1933. Since then unemployed. Was put under surveillance in Tehran in 1935 owing to supposed inefficiency (perhaps complicity) in connexion with the Bakhtiari plots in 1934. Sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and permanent exclusion from Government service, in June 1936, for accepting a bribe when Minister of Roads. Governor-General of Isfahan, May-June 1944, until Supreme Court of Appeal decided he was ineligible for office on the grounds of the sentence passed on him in 1936.

Minister of Justice, July 1940, and again in Furughi’s Cabinet of September 1941 and Soheily’s of May 1942. Ambassador to U.S.S.R., August 1942. As Minister of Justice he was largely responsible for the details of the law concerning the restitution of the ex-Shah’s properties to their former owners. In those discussions he showed more attention to detail than to principle and the resulting cumbrous and complicated enactment pleased few except the lawyers who tried to understand it and interpreted it in various ways. Speaks Russian, French and a little German. Married a Russian or Polish Jewess. Able, hard working, and friendly to foreigners in general. 4. Airom {Ayrora), General Muhummad Hussein. Born about 1882. Son of an emigrant from Erivan. Educated in Tehran and in Russia. Commissioned into the infantrv of the Cossack Division about 1901. In 1912 colonel and staff officer at the Cossack Division headquarters. Fell into disgrace in 1918 as the result of intrigues with women. A favourite of Reza, he was re-employed in 1922 and appointed to command the Northern Independent Brigade at Resht. While in that command he showed enterprise, energy and some power of organisation, and kept Bolshevik intrigues under severe control. He also did a great deal for the improvement of the city*of Resht. Appointed commander of the troops at Tabriz in 1925. Fell again into disgrace a'year later, probably through his inability to abstain from intrigue. Chief Inspector of the army in 1927, and in the police of Tehran during 1928. Went to Europe; then returned to be chief of inspection missions in 1930 and 1931. Appointed chief of police in April 193J. At one time, Ayrom was looked upon as having greater power than any member of the Cabinet and to be the Shah’s right-hand man. His son even married a sister of the Queen; he subsequently died of a mysterious disease. Ayrom left suddenly for Germany, ostensibly for medical treatment, in the summer of 1935. Serious charges of taking bribes and of all kinds of trickery have since been made against him, and Reza Shah, furious with ‘ ‘ the only one of my trusted servants who has hitherto deceived me,” tried to secure his extradition. But he got large sums of money out of the country, and was heard of in 1942 living on the Riviera as a Count of Lichtenstein. Has an Italian wife, whom no one saw while he was at Tehran. Speaks Russian and a little German. A strong disciplinarian; he had no use for bolshevism and organised a kind of Ogpu in Tehran to counteract Soviet spying. C.M.G. (Mu‘in-ul- 5. A la, Hussein, Vizareh). Born about 1884. Son of the late Prince Ala-es- Saltaneh, for many years Persian Minister in London. Educated at Westminster School, where he seems to have received rough treatment, which resulted in a strong anti-British bias, at any rate for the next few years. Created C.M.G. in 1905, when he accompanied his father on a special mission to London for the coronation of the late King Edward \ II. Appointed ” chef de cabinet ” in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1906, his late father being then Minister for Foreign Affairs. He remained as ‘‘ chef de cabinet ” to various Ministers until 1915. Appointed Minister of Public Works in January 1918, and continued to direct that Ministry during the Cabinet presided over by Samsam-us-Saltaneh, which was in power from May to August 1918. This Cabinet abrogated the Treaty of Turkmanchai. Ala was hostile to Sir Charles Marling, His Majesty’s Minister from 1915 to 1918, and caused repeated complaints to be made to the Foreign Office through his brother, who was then Persian Minister in London. He accompanied the abortive Persian mission to the Paris Peace Conference in 1918. Appointed Persian Minister at Madrid in 1919, and at Washington in 1920. Conducted nego tiations in Washington in 1921-22 for the American Financial Mission to Persia, after he had failed to obtain the North Persia Oil Concession first for the Standard Oil Company and then for the Sinclair Corporation. Returned from Washington in 1925 and took his seat in the fifth Majlis as a Deputv for Tehran. Minister of Public Works for a short time in ^May 192/. Second delegate to the League of Nations for some time. Attended Locarno 1 ' in that capacity in December 1928. Appointed Minister at Paris in 1929. One of the Persian delegates selected to represent Persia before k 0the League of Nations in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute in 1933. Returned to Tehran early in 1933 to take over a high post in the National Bank of Persia, though he had no particular know ledge of banking. Was also very active in the organisation of the “ Red Lion and Sun, and in the Ferdausi Memorial Committee. In 1931 his transfer to the post of Minister in London was mooted, though it did not materialise. On that occasion His Majesty’s Government were unwilling to receive him, on the ground that his attitude in reporting a libel on His Majesty King George V rendered it difficult to suppose that he was then animated by friendly sentiments. Appointed Minister in London, July 1934. Recalled in the summer of 1936; returned to Tehran in October. Appointed Supervisor of Monopoly Companies, December 1936. Director-General of Commerce in 1937, and given the new appointment of Minister of Commerce in September 1937. Removed from this appointment, April 1938.

Ala was one of the first of her generation to leave off the veil. President of the National Bank, October 1941. Minister of Court, October 1942, but appears to have done nothing to curb the young Shah’s evident intention to rule the country in much the same way as his father did. A hard worker and a staunch patriot; intelligent and well-read; interested in the literature of many countries and quite a good pianist. Has a perfect command of English and speaks good French. In the past he has had a reputation for anti-British sentiments. In 1943 and 1944, however, his relations with the British Legation were good; he seems a good deal more anti-Russian than anti- British, and is doubtless more pro-Persian than either. He is a sensitive Persian Nationalist who realises the failings of his fellow-countrymen. Tends to overrate the virtues of the Shah. Appointed Ambassador to Washington in August 1945 when status of Persian Legation there was raised to that of an embassy. Was very active in giving publicity in the United States to the Persian case over the Azerbaijan problem and showed ability in presenting Persia’s case to the Security Council. 6. A mini, Dr. A li. Fourth son of Mohsen Ammi (Amin-ed-Douleh). Born at Tehran in 1903. Educated in Persia and in France. Studied law at Paris. Married one of the daughters of Hassan Vussugh (Vussugh-ed-Douleh).

Secretary to Qawam-es-Saltaneh when Prime Minister in 1942. Appointed as head of a commer cial mission to Washington by the latter, but did not proceed.

A mirahmedi (or A hmedi), A hmed A gha. Born in Tehran about 1880. Comes from an Ardebil family, his forbears having emigrated from the Caucasus. Enlisted in the Cossack Brigade in 1899 and received speedy promotion; he was soon commissioned, and was a general in 1920. Took a prominent part in operations against the Jang^I in 1919. When the army was reorganised in l^P he was given the rank of Amir Lashkar (chief of a division) and placed in command of the Western Division with headquarters at Hamadan. W T as recalled on account of his shameless robbery and for his treacherous oppression of the Lurs; but, being a favourite of Reza Shah’s, he was appointed to command the amnieh or road guards. Appointed in 1926 to command the North-W T est Division, while retaining command of the amnieh. Recalled the next year, and appointed to command in Luristan in the spring of 1928.

Resigned December 1943 when Soheily reformed his Cabinet and at the Shah’s instance appointed Zand, a civilian, as Minister of War. Refused command of the Southern division as he considered he would not be properly supported in Tehran in that appointment. Suspected by the Russians and disliked by the Shah and Yazdan-Panah for his attempt to insist on the authority of the Ministry of War and to limit the Shah’s intervention in matters of command and administration. Ambitious and always hopeful of becoming Prime Minister. Though his record of bribe-taking and his sketchy education do not make him a satisfactory candidate for a head of Government, he has shown himself a man of action and determination in times of crisis, and has been very friendly to us since Reza Shah’s departure. Minister of War in Qavam’s Cabinet, February 1946. Speaks Russian. His accumulated wealth and large properties appear to have satisfied his desires, so that he seems to have got over his youthful inclination towards robbery. 8. A miri (A mery) Jar ad.

In 1945 he showed an inclination to turn to the Embassy for support against Russian pressure. A talkative demagogue, fond of working himself into passionate indignation about subjects which he does not understand. For instance, he opposed the Tripartite Treaty and caused the Feroughi Cabinet a great deal of trouble. But he is amenable to argument, and, though pig-headed and vain, is not entirely without good ideas. 10. Ansari (Ansarie), Abdul Hussein Mas‘ud (Massoud).

When he was in charge of the Economics Section it proved impossible to get much useful information out of him, and as the head of the Third Political Depart ment he was not particularly helpful.

A member of the third, fourth and fifth Majlises from Meshed, and of the sixth from Tehran. Edited his paper No-Bahdr in Tehran during the war of 1914-18, and was pronouncedly pro-German. Nevertheless, he supported Vossugh-ed-Douleh’s Cabinet of 1918-20 during which time he edited the Iran newspaper. Opposed the Government during the term of the fifth Majlis and was an opponent of the change of regime. An attempt was made on his life when the debate on the change of regime took place in the Majlis; but another unfortunate man who resembled him was the victim. Seyyid Hasan Mudarris helped him to get elected to the sixth Majlis. Nothing much was heard of him during Reza Shah s reign, except that he composed some odes in celebation of the Firdausi centenary in October 1934, and translated into Persian verse a poem bv John Drinkwater on that occasion. He has been exiled from Tehran on more than one occasion. In spite of a fondness for opium has been fairly active at Tehran since the change of regime in 1941. Up to August 1942 he and Massoud Sabeti acti\ eh supported Qavam-es-Saltaneh’s candidature for the post of Prime Minister. After the latter’s fall early in 1943, he obtained newsprint from the Russians with which he kept his paper No-Bahdr going, and published a series of articles apparently critical of but really supporting Qavam. In fact a shifty and over-subtle politician. Acknowledged to be a leading poet, and a practical newspaper writer. He himself maintains that heis above all anti-Russian but has been associated with the Tudeh for some years. On Committee of Russo-Persian Cultural Relations Society, March 1944. Minister of Education in Qavam’s Cabinet, February 1946. 26. Bahraini, Farajullah (Dahir-i-A l zam). Born about 1890. A member of a well-known and numerous Tehran family.

In July 1980 appointed Governor of Isfahan, and a year later Governor-General of Ears. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in March 1932. Resigned on the fall of the Hedayat Cabinet in September 1933, and was sent to Meshed as Governor-General in the following January. Superseded as Governor-General of Khorasan in October 1934, for reporting that adequate facilities did not exist at Meshed for the accommodation of the orientalists attending the Ferdausi millenary. Since that time under a cloud. In the summer of 1935 he w r as suspected of complicity in some plot and was exiled to Malayir. Allow’ed to return to Tehran under surveillance, October 1936. After the change of rdgime in 1941 he has been a prominent member of the Adalat party. Minister of the Interior in January 1943, but he very soon became involved in a quarrel with his chief, Qawam- es-Saltaneh, which led to the collapse of the latter’s Cabinet. His criticisms of his chief in that episode did not create a good impression on this Legation; he is evidently self-opinionated and stubborn. Is very alarmed at the Soviet menace to the indepen dence of Persia. Governor-General of Isfahan, 1943-44. A very friendly person, who always appears to do what he can to help British consular officers. Has great aspirations to literary eminence; a great admirer of Hafiz. As Minister he incurred some criticism from his fellow-countrymen for inaccessi bility and lack of hospitality. Speaks very little French. Businesslike and hard-working. 27. Bohr ami, Fazlullah. Born about 1897. For some time a colonel in the police, and in charge of the detective force. Acting chief of the Tehran Municipality in 1937. Director of Census and Civil Status, January 1938.

Head of the municipality again July 1943; sus pended from his functions during the Tehran elec tions at the end of 1943 owing to accusations of illegal intervention in the elections, but resumed his functions January 1944. A large individual with some energy; but he seems to have made a good deal of money by dubious land transactions when head of the municipality. Obstinate like all the Bahramy family. Governor-General of Kerman 1944-45 where he showed great initiative by organising various schemes for improving water supply, raising money for orphanages, &amp;c.—popular there. Offered post of Governor-General, Kermanshah, in August 1945, but refused. Health undermined by malaria. Friendly and co-operative when in Kerman.

He escaped the fate of his fellow Khans, and has assisted the Government in their policj 7 of inducing the Bakhtiari tribe to abandon their traditional nomadic habits. Appointed Governor of Bakhtiari early in 1943 and did well, suppressing various upstarts like Abol Ghassem, and establishing order in that tribal area, thereby serving British interests well during the war. A clever man, not above intrigue. Quick tempered, jovial and obstinate. Served Reza Shah well. Very pleasant to meet, but not the sort of man one can trust very far, as he is very much in the hands of his strong-minded wife and also places implicit trust in a worthless agent, Misbah Fatemy. By the end of 1945 he had, however, become unpopular with the other tribal Khans who agitated for his removal. Relieved of his appointment by Qavam-us-Saltaneh for leaving Tehran for his properties in the south despite explicit instructions not to do so until he had reached agreement with the other Khans. 29.

Speaks a little French. A highly respectable and polite man. Minister without Portfolio in Sa’id's Cabinet March-August 1944. Prime Minister November 1944-April 1945. He sought to improve relations with the Russians but his efforts only resulted in the paralysis of the administration of the country.

Joined Qavam’s Cabinet in February 1946 as Minister of Finance. 30. Bayendor, Ghidam Hussein. Elder brother of Ghulam Ali Bayendor.

Governor-General Tabriz, February 1944. Recalled February 1945. Friendly and pleasant in manner. When in Tabriz invariably took the line of least resistance and was regarded as nothing more than an amiable figurehead. Seemed to be completely amenable to the wishes of the Russians. A voluble talker but carries no weight. 33. Dashti, Ali. Born about 1887. Educated in the schools of the Holy Places of Iraq. Returned to Persia about 1922 and edited a paper called the Shafaq Surkh. As an editor he became notorious for slanderous abuse and the extortion of money by blackmail, and his abuse of Great Britain and British statesmen was frequently the subject of complaint from His Majesty’s Legation to the Persian Government. He was elected a Deputy to the fifth Majlis in 1924, but he was refused a seat by the Parliamentary Commission, whose duty it was to scrutinise his election proceedings. He was prominent in the abortive Republican movement in 1924, and is said to have received and pocketed large sums from Reza Pahlavi, on whose behalf he worked. After acquiring a share of this world’s goods he appeared to become more human and ceased the abuse and vituperation for which he had become famous. He espoused the cause of Reza Pahlavi against Ahmed Shah, and was elected a Deputy to the sixth Majlis in 1926. He was invited to Moscow in October 1927 to attend the tenth anniversary of the Soviet regime. From Moscow he went to Berlin and Paris and returned to Persia early in 1928. He was elected a Deputy to the seventh Majlis in 1928 and to the eighth Majlis in 1930. Edited or controlled his paper till about July 1935, receiving subsidies now from the Shah and now from the Soviet Embassy. He is a hot-headed [78—62] firebrand with no scruples and no principles, and is capable of the basest villainy if it will help him to attain his ends. He speaks no European language, except a little French. In July 1935 he fell into disgrace and was said to have uttered disparaging remarks about Reza Shah’s rdgime. His paper was suppressed and he himself was allowed to plead sickness and to retire to a Government hospital, where he was made to pay well for his maintenance. At liberty again at the end of 1936. In charge of the Press Bureau of the Ministry of Interior in 1937. Since the fall of Reza has returned to the fore front of Tehran politics. A severe critic of Feroughi and Soheily in 1942, he worked hard for the return of Qawam-es-Saltaneh as Prime Minister. When the latter came back to power and did not make Dashti a Minister, he turned against him and criticised him in many speeches. Dashti is certainly a persuasive orator, who holds the attention of the Majlis as few other persons can do. A prime mover in the Adalat party, he now utters the most enthusiastic praise of democracy on the British model, and evidently hopes that his past will be forgotten by us. As he appears to have much more audacity and forensic ability than most of his rivals, he may well go a good deal further than his present position as a Majlis Deputy. Elected to fourteenth Majlis 1943. Since the oil crisis of 1944 he has opposed the spread of Russian influence in Persia, and has strongly supported the ‘‘ resistance ” Cabinets preceding Qavam-us-Saltaneh’s. Was consistently attacked by Tudeh press during this period. Trusted little even by his friends who regard his excessive attachment to vcomen (which he publicly displays) as not in keeping with high office. 34. Daulatshahi, A bid-Fath. Born about 1879.

Appointed Governor of Luristan in 1925, but did not proceed; Governor- General of Fars 1936, from which appointment he was dismissed in September 1937, and was arrested for numerous corrupt practices. An easy-going spendthrift, up to his ears in debt, but not without intelligence. Since 1941 has come out of his shell and is evidently hoping for employment, but was disappointed at failing to get elected to the fourteenth Majlis from Kermanshah. 35. Diba, Abut Hassan {Siqat-ed-Douleh). Born in Tehran 1898. Son of the late Vakil-ul- Mulk; a half-brother of Hishmat-ud-Douleh and of Dr. Musaddiq. His mother is a sister of Farman Farma.

Has planned a model village at Veramine, of which he is very proud. Minister of Agriculture in Sa'id’s Cabinet, March 1944, but only retained office for a few days. Helpful and business-like, though inclined to be too optimistic and to imagine that all Persia’s agricultural difficulties can be solved by tractors. 42. Fateh, Mustafa. Born in Isfahan about 1897. Son of Fateh-ul- Mulk, a servant of the Prince-Governor of Isfahan, Zill-us-Sultan. Educated at Tehran and at Colombia University, United States, where he graduated in economics.

He also has an international outlook and a considerable knowledge of world politics, particularly those of the Left. In 1943 founded the Hamrahan party, with the express object of combating communism, though the party’s programme contained elaborate socialistic ideals far beyond anything which wall be practicable in Persia for some time. Always very approachable and desirous of enlisting British help for his schemes; and a mine of information about the foibles of his countrymen, whom he divides into two sharply distinct categories: (1) The old gang who are hopelessly corrupt, and (2) his party members who are sublimely honest. Few other people believe in this dichotomy, and he had many enemies who accused him of devoting the oil company’s funds to the purposes of his party and its newspaper, Imrooz ve Farda. The Hamrahan party never came to anything and died a natural death. Has a son in England and a daughter married to Asghar Mirza, the son of Sarem-ud-Douleh, who surely w^ould come in category (1). His wife was a daughter of the Zill-us-Sultan’s head secretary, Siraj-ul-Mulk. 43. Fatimi, Mehdi {Imad-us-Saltaneh). Born about 1886. Has had an official career in the Ministry of Finance, and in 1918 was financial11 representative in his native city of Isfahan, where lie is influential both through his own family and through that of his wife, who is a daughter of the late Prince Zill-es-Sultan.

He and another, named Hussein Saadat, wrote a book against Islam. In order to marry his present wife, who is well off, became a Bahai. Farmandar (Governor) of Shiraz 1941^43; then resigned, apparently because he had amassed too much money there. His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, considered him energetic, helpful and capable. Then returned to Isfahan as candidate for the Majlis for Najafabad, and though he had little real following in that area success was engineered for him by Morteza Quli Bakhtiari and Sarem ud Douleh. Intelligent, entirely unscrupulous, and very ambitious; speaks good English and has studied English and English literature, and can remember many extracts. At present (1944) it suits him to appear pro-British; he is certainly anti-Russian. Has many enemies, both Persian and British, but is a man who can, when he wishes, make himself very useful. Was largely responsible for organising the anti-Tudeh Workers’ Union in Isfahan. Before Qavarn came into power in 1946, he pretended to be passionately opposed to him (a ruse enacted to please the British). In fact he almost certainly supported him as was shown by an article appearing in his brother’s paper Bakhtar on the day that Qavam was elected. After the demise of the 14th Majlis he went on a visit to the United States. 45. Ferouhar, A bbas. Born about 1895. Though his junior in age, is an uncle of Abul-Qasim Ferouhar.

Ferouhar, unlike his colleagues at the Court, survived the ordeal of the Crown Prince’s wedding celebrations. Sent to Beirut with the vague title of “ Del^gud ” at the end of 1942. Recalled temporarily in 1943 to give explanations about the conduct of Muzaffar Firuz. Charge d’Affaires to Greek Court in Cairo, June 1944. A talkative but somewhat too oily little man. 46.

Worked for a time in the Soviet Consulate-General at Isfahan in connexion with the sale of Soviet textiles in Isfahan. From 1940 onwards has devoted most of his energies to bettering the lot of the Isfahan factory workers and has done much to help them, as he has become the chief workers’ representative in disputes about conditions of work. Founded a primitive sort of trade union for the protection of workers’ interests, including insurance. Elected to the fourteenth Majlis for Isfahan 1943, being supported by the Tudeh party, of which he is a member, though he disclaims being a Communist and is not looked upon favourably by the Tudeh party in Tehran owing to his moderate views. He is' thought not to have had any direct relations with the Soviet authorities concerning the elections. He is, of course, disliked by most of the capitalists of Isfahan, though some of them accept him as a fairly single- minded man. His main political following is among the factory workers and guilds and small bazaar men, who are naturally opposed to domination by the few rich families of Isfahan. Lost his political following among the factorv workers of Isfahan during 1944^-45 when the Isfahan workers’ union broke away from the Tudeh. On coming to Tehran as a Deputy he immedaitely fell under Soviet influence. In April 1946 succeeded in re-establishing Tudeh influence in the Isfahan factories. 48. Firuz, Muhammad Hussein. Born about 1895. The fourth son of the late Farman Farma. Educated at the military college at Petrograd. Entered the Persian army during the 1914-18 war, and was regarded as one of the c 212 4* promising young officers of the army. Appointed Ciiief of Staff of the Southern Division in 1925, and did very good work in organising the troops in Fars and enforcing discipline and efficiency. Sent to Delhi as representative of the Persian army at the Indian army manoeuvres early in 1925. Fell under suspicion for some reason about 1929 and resigned his commission. His Qajar origin was no doubt the cause of his collapse. Very attached to his brother Firuz (Nusrat-ed-Douleh) but not on good terms with his father. Married a Miss Xamazi, who was educated in Hong Kong and speaks English perfectly. Returned to Persia late in 1941, and was sent to Fars as G.O.C. and Governor-General in March 1942. Superseded in both appointments by Marshal Shahbakhti a year later. He had succeeded in keeping a rather precarious order in Fars, but never succeeded in repressing Nasir Qashqai’s rebellious movement. Head of the air force, 1943. Again appointed Governor-General of Fars in early summer of 1944 but did not get on with the influential Qavam-ul-Mulk or the Qashqai Khans. His enemies accused him of weakness and of truckling too much to the Tudeh, but His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, on the contrary, considered that his refusal to take unnecessarily repressive measures against the Tudeh was more sound. Appointed Minister of War in Sa'id’s reconstituted Cabinet in August 1944 but refused the appointment. Minister of Communications in Hakimi’s Cabinet November 1945. Resigned a month later. Returned to the same Ministry in Qavam’s Cabinet in February 1946. Speaks very good French and some English; intelligent and enlightened. A brilliant talker, he seems capable of proving with most convincing reasons that he is always right—but one feels sometimes that he is too convincing. 49. Firuz, Muhammad Vali. Third son of the late Farman Farma. Born about 1893. Educated at Beirut and Paris. Sent to Tabriz as head of the Finance Department, 1915. Said to have taken many bribes while in that appointment. Is very thrifty and has large properties both in Tehran and Tabriz. Elected a Deputy to the fourth, fifth and sixth Majlises for Tabriz. On the fall of his brother, Nusrat-ed- Douleh, in 1931, he retired from public life and was seldom seen. Has been in Europe a good deal Elected to the thirteenth Majlis for Sarab in September 1941, and again to the fourteenth in November 1943. His appearance being that of an underfed bird of prey, seems to keep him in the background, but he has a good deal of his father’s intelligence. 50. Firuz, Muzaffar. Born about 1910, grandson of Farman Farma, brother of Muhammad Shah, and accordingly uses the title of Prince in social life. Educated at Harrow and Cambridge. Speaks excellent English and fair French: is bitterly hostile to the Pahlavi dynasty and his sole raison d'etre is to avenge the murder of his father by Riza Shah. His hostility has recently been sharpened by the fact that his wife’s relation, Ismit-ul-Muluk, one of the wives of Reza Shah, was recently evicted from the palace on a charge of improper behaviour. At one time employed in Persian Legation in Washington, whence, it is believed, he was removed at the request of the United States Government for abuse of diplomatic bag privileges. It was Firuz who went to Palestine and brought from there Sayyid Zia’s first manifesto. He remained an ardent supporter of Sayyid Zia until May 1945 when he broke with him. He says that the breach was caused by Sayyid Zia’s becoming more and more dictatorial but Sayyid Zia’s version was that they had to part because Firuz would not abandon his newspaper campaign, in the newspaper Ra'd-i-Imruz which he owns and edits, against the Shah, and Sayyid Zia felt that it was impossible to fight the Russians and the Shah at the same time. Towards the end of 1945 he became one of the chief supporters of Qavam-ul-Saltaneh. A^a reward for this Qavam, when he became PriF^ Minister in February 1946, appointed Firuz Political Under-Secretary, an office apparently created for the purpose, and Director of Propaganda. A lackey by nature he needs a master which he found first in Sayyid Zia and second in Qavam. He has a bent for propaganda and sensational journalism. At present, May 1946, he has succeeded in making himself extremely unpopular even with his colleagues. His madness is enhanced by a titanic conceit which enables him to believe that he is leading the Tudeh and the U.S.S.R. by the nose. Impartial observers consider the contrary to be the case. Rash, unbalanced, dishonest, untruthful and malicious, would probably sacrifice anything to bring about the downfall of the Shah. The Shah is aware of this and will find it difficult to work with a Prime Minister who could make such an appointment. 51. Ghaffari, Amir Saham ud Din (Zuka- ud-Daideh). Born in Tehran about 1880.

He was dismissed in November 1929 for permitting publication in the press of the judicial safeguards accorded to foreign subjects in 1928, after the abolition of the extra territorial privileges, but was reinstated in December 1929.

Head of the Mortgage Bank 1939. Realised one of his ambitions when he became president of the National Bank of Iran (Banque Mellie) in September 1942. In that post he has worked hard and been of great service to us in many ways. He seems to be one of the few Persian financiers with intelligence, ability and energy. On the other hand he is hasty, hot-tempered and easily upset, and his persistence in an unwise legal attack on the Imperial Bank of Iran (a suit which he eventually lost) seems to show that he bears that institution a grudge.

He is pleasant and agreeable, though inclined to suffer from swelled head. Intelligent and fairly well educated, he is enthusiastic about sport, which he has done much to encourage in the Persian army; plays polo and tennis moderately well. Fond of European society, easy-going, and somewhat lacking in determination. He does not fleece the populace as do many of his colleagues.

Minister of War, March 1942, and employed in the autumn at court as a kind of aide-de-camp in general to the Shah.

In 1925 he was appointed Governor-General of Isfahan. In June 1927 he was appointed Governor-General of Fars, and in December 1927 went to Bagdad as acting consul-general. His tenure of office at Bagdad was not a success; he fell foul of the Residency owing to certain discourteous omis sions in his conduct towards the Residency officials. Whether or not these transgressions were performed on his own responsibility or under instructions from his Government, the latter soon recalled him in some disfavour.

Kazemi is socially agreeable and friendly, and speaks English and some French. As Minister for Foreign Affairs he was not a success.

Minister of Public Health, December 1941 to March 1942. Then Minister of Finance in Qawam- es-Saltaneh’s Cabinet of August 1942, but resigned before its fall in circumstances which did him little credit.

His anti-British bias, a legacy from 1922, led him into intrigues with German agents and in August 1943 he fled from Tehran to avoid arrest. He was arrested by British security authorities in June 1944 and confessed to having helped German agents. Released in August 1945. He nurses a bitter enmity towards the British. 81.

Selected by Reza Shah for the post of Prime Minister June 1940, it was to him that the joint Russo-British ultimatum was delivered on the 25th August, 1941. As the result of the subsequent events he resigned in September 1941.

The two-fold stigma of being pro-British and a Qajar prevented him coming back to power during the regime of Reza Shah. Since the fall of Reza Shah he has continued aloof from public affairs, though he has kept in touch with what is going on, and has now become the unofficial controller of almost every thing in Isfahan. He takes a great pride in his model village at Asgharabad. near Isfahan, and may very easily have a part to play in shaping Persia’s future in the next few years.

He accom panied the present Shah, when Crown Prince, to Iraq, Syria and Egypt on his wedding tour as press representative, and kept the Tehran press supplied with a stream of accounts of the Prince’s doings, in that quasi-religious style that alone was permitted to Persians when speaking of their monarchy.

Member of the mission to Egypt for the Crown Prince’s marriage February- April 1939. Prime Minister, October 1939. Reza Shah made him resign in June 1940, and his conduct of the various negotiations which had taken place while he was Prime Minister gave rise to a strong suspicion that he was favouring the Germans. In fact, in the speech which he made to journalists and Majlis Deputies shortly after Matin-Daftary s dismissal, Reza Shah accused him of not reporting fully to the Shah. However, it is difficult to believe this; the Shah being an absolute autocrat, receiving detailed reports from numerous sources, it seems unlikely that any Prime Minister would risk the Royal wrath by suppressing anything. He himself says it was the Shah who ordered him to favour the Germans. Retired into seclusion in June 1940 until two years later. In 1943 was evidently hoping to re-enter the political arena. Arrested as a suspect June 1943, but soon released. Minister without Portfolio in Qavam’s Cabinet, February 1946. Speaks French and German, and a little English; he has travelled in England. A very hard-working and conscientious official, always very helpful when approached. A good speaker, with a thorough knowledge of local legal administration.

He is not popular with many of his compatriots in high places owing to his straightforward character and outspokenness. In 1931 he was appointed steward of the Royal estates in Mazanderan, a post which appears to have occupied all his energies till 1935.

He is personally very charming and cultivated, speaking French and well read in French literature. Has always been on good terms with members of His Majesty’s Legation, to whom he has consistently shown hospitality, even when it would appear against his interests to do so. In November 1933, as a result of an article in the Daily Mirror alluding to the Qajar family, a press campaign against that family began in the Tehran press, and Nusrat-us-Saltaneh, as the principal Qajar in Tehran, wrote a letter to the press stating that the numerous members of that family, who resided in Persia, were completely satisfied with the Pahlavi regime.

He is determined to interpret literally the provision of the Constitution which says that the Shah is the commander of the armed forces, and has hitherto delegated little if any responsibility in army matters to the Minister for War. As yet he has no male heir and he has not yet declared any of his brothers to be the “ Vali-ahd ” or next in succession to the throne. His attitude in the riots of the 8th December, 1942, and in the re-shuffle of Soheily’s Cabinet in December 1943, showed him to be on the one hand prone to listen to the advice of worthless subordinates, and on the other hand determined to emulate his father and (in the reported words of Stalin to him at the Tehran Conference of November-December 1943) “be a King in fact as well as in name.’’ His admiration for his father, and the influence of his bitterly anti-British mother! must both tend to make him believe the theory which his mother instils into him, that the British expelled Reza Shah, whereas in actual fact the latter abdicated at the advance of Russian troops on Tehran. He has neither intelligence nor courage but a boundless capacity for intrigue. In public utterances and official interviews he is plausible enough, but he is utterly without will, has no discrimination in the choice of his advisers and tends to take the advice of the last person he sees. The weakness of successive Governments in Persia since he mounted the throne has been largely the responsibility of the Shah. Completely lacking in courage or any sort of moral fibre himself, he25 has consistently discouraged all who made a firm stand against the Russians from Sa‘id to Hakimi. During the latter’s tenure of office, he completely collapsed and spent much of his time weeping on his mother’s shoulder. At heart he is bitterly opposed to Qavam-us- Saltaneh, probably because only they know the secret of the bloody events of the 8th December, 1. Even so he dared not do anything to oppose his coming into power in February 1945. Before the departure of Queen Fauzieh, his immorality was notorious, but he is said to have curbed his desires since. He is unlikely ever to make a capable monarch, constitutional or otherwise. He has spent enormous sums of money on worthless political parties and papers, but during the 1946 crisis was unwilling to give a single penny to curb the activities of the Tudeh. 122.

K.C.M.G. 123. Pak-Nazar, Jaafar (Ihtisham-ul- Vizareh). Bom about 1888. An employee of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In charge of the section dealing with cyphers for many years.

Counsellor in Kabul 1941. Consul-General Herat 1943. Inspector in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs 1945. Speaks a little French. Always very friendly, but many years of coping with the cyphers of the Ministry have blunted the edge of his intelligence. [78—62] 124. Pakravan, FathuUah (Amir-i-Arfa'). Born about 1885. First became known as a member of the second Majlis, where it appears that he was the laughing-stock of his colleagues. In 1910 he obtained the appointment of Persian consul- general in Constantinople, although he had had no previous career in any Government Department. From Constantinople he went to Egypt as consul- general, and later became Persian Minister there until he returned to Tehran early in 1925. In 1925 he was appointed Director of the Russian and Turkish section in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Soviet Embassy objected to this appointment at first, on the score that Pakravan, having been many years in Egypt, was probably a British agent. Finally, the Soviet Embassy withdrew its objection, and Pakravan became persona grata with the Russians, so much that when Ansari became Minister for Foreign Affairs in July 1926 the Soviet Embassy asked that Pakravan be appointed Under secretary. He duly received this appointment, and was in charge of the Ministry during Ansari’s absence in Moscow until he was appointed Persian Minister in Rome in December 1928. When he assumed charge of the Foreign Ministry, the first impression he conveyed was that of an agreeable and conscientious young man, but closer contact proved him to be a garrulous nonentity. Teymourtache exercised a close supervision over matters relating to the Foreign Ministry, and it was evident that Pakravan carried no weight, and was but a figurehead. Teymourtache w’as at no pains to hide the fact that he considered Pakravan merely an amiable fool. Interviews with him were mere waste of time, and during the twenty months that he was in charge of the Ministry affairs remained at a standstill. Appointed Persian Ambassador to the U.S.S.R. in February 1931. Was accredited also to Finland and Estonia as Minister in 1932. Has a Russian wife. Recalled from Moscow in February 1934. Appointed Governor-General of Khorassan November 1934. Order of the Humayun, 1st class, May 1937. In Khorassan he showed that, if backed by the Shah, he is prepared to ride roughshod over all opposition. After the fall of Reza Shah, was relieved by Ali Mansour in February 1942 and was brought to- Tehran under arrest on various charges of pecula tion and irregular conduct while Governor-General of Khorassan; but managed to get out of prison on bail after a few months. At present living at Tehran unemployed; it is unlikely that the popular indignation against the many arbitrary acts which he had to commit by order of the ex-Shah will soon permit his re-employment. Nevertheless he was one of the very few Persian officials who stood his ground when the Russians invaded the Meshed district in August 1941, and he deserves credit for preventing a good deal of destruction by his firmness on that occasion. Speaks French fluently. Has a Russian wife who speaks fluent English. Appointed Ambassador to Italy late 1945. Left to take up appointment May 1946. 125. Pirnazar, Hassan. Born in Tehran about 1895.

Received his first Cabinet appointment in 1918 as Minister of Education. Was appointed a Minister without Portfolio in 1920. He has generally preferred a parliamentary to a ministerial career, and was elected to every term of the Majlis since its inception until the seventh term. To that term also he was elected, but refused to take his seat, as he did not consider the elections to have been held freely. He was chosen as president for the whole terms of the third and fourth Parliaments and for the greater part of the fifth term and for half of the sixth term, and he showed himself to be firm and impartial. Has not come back to politics since the fall •of Reza Shah, though he is often mentioned in terms of extravagant praise as the most honest man, if not the only honest man, in Persia, He refused to form a Government on the fall of the Qawam-es-Saltaneh Government in February 1943, in spite of the insistent request of the Deputies; and similarly refused to be head of the Committee of Supervision for the Tehran elections to the Majlis in 1943. Elected for Tehran 1944 but refused to take his seat. Has property in Tehran. Wealthy. Not interested in politics; is influential and respected. Religious and anti-foreign. Has retired from public life but force of circumstances may bring him back. Head of the Pirnia family. 127. Pishavari, Mir Jafar.

Governor of Kermanshah in 1897; of Zinjan in 1899 and 1900, and of Arabistan from 1901 to 1904, where he married the daughter of a local chief. Fled from Tehran to Luristan in April 1904, but was brought back and appointed Governor of Kurdistan in 1905. Collected tribesmen from Luristan and rebelled against Muhammad Ali Shah in June 1907. A fight occurred in that month between his followers and the Shah’s troops outside Nihavend. He was defeated and took refuge at the British consulate at Kermanshah, but was handed over to the Persian authorities under a promise of personal safety. Thereafter he was placed under surveillance and was considered mentally deranged. Expelled to Europe after ccmp d’Etat of 1908. Entered Persia again in May 1911 from the direction of Bagdad. In the following July he seized the capital of Kurdistan and advanced on Kermanshah. Having arrived there he collected a large force of Lurs, including the Kalhur tribe, and marched on Tehran via Sultanabad. Bakhtiaris and Armenian irregulars were sent against him and inflicted a severe defeat on him near Nubaran in September 1911. He then retreated to Luristan and was again defeated in November 1911. Having been at large in Kermanshah and Kurdistan for some time, he suddenly appeared near Tehran and threatened, but did not actually attack, the capital. He then betook himself to Asterabad whence, with the assistance of Russian influence, he carried on negotiations with the Persian Government to be appointed Governor of Gilan. After some further adventures he was persuaded to leave Persia with a pension from the Persian Government and resided in Switzerland till 1918. In that year he formed a project to enter Persia through Transcaspia and raise a revolt in the Asterabad district. He was caught by a British detachment in about December 1918 before crossing the Persian frontier, and was sent via Kazvin to Bagdad where he was interned till the following autumn, when he was again allowed to return to Switzerland. He slipped over the Iraq-Persian frontier in June 1926 somehow avoiding the Iraq police authorities. His presence caused considerable embarrassment to the new Pahlavi Government who realised that Salar, however mad, was a possible rallying point for the forces of reaction. However, after fruitless negotiations with various Kurdish chiefs, during which he contracted marriage with the daughters of some of them, he left Persia in the autumn of 1926. The Persian Government from that date paid him a subsidy of 1,500 rials per month from secret funds up to September 1933. Salar was persuaded to settle down at Haifa after having given an ambiguous promise to behave himself.27 (IIV On the cessation of his subsidy in 1933 he was informed by British authorities that he was free to do what he liked. In 1935 living at Alexandria, where he has employed lawyers to press his claims against His Majesty’s Government. Speaks French. Scatter-brained and under-sized.

Qaraguzlu, Hussein Ali. Second and younger son of the late Nasir-ul- Mulk, Regent of Persia. Born in 1900. Educated at Harrow and Balliol College, Oxford.

Charming but ineffective; his failure to fulfil his earlv promise has been a disappointment, but a believer in Anglo-Persian co-operation. An idealist with a certain intelligence and a reputation for honesty. Speaks perfect English and French. 133. Nizam-Qaraguzlu, Hussein Quli (Amir Nizam). Born in 1883, the eldest son of the late Amir Nizam. A member of the Qaragozlu family of Hamadan and a nephew of the late Regent, Nasir- ul-Mulk.

Inherited large estates from his father in the district of Hamadan, but owing to his absence in Europe from 1921 to 1929 these estates have been allowed to deteriorate. Was appointed Governor of Kermanshah bv \ossuq in 1919, where he was verv popular on account of bis hones t\ and integrity. Being a rich man he was imprisoned at the time of the coup d’Etat in 1921, and made to pay 20,000 tomans as the price of his release. He was so disgusted at this unmerited treatment [78—62] that he left Persia and vowed never to return- During his stay in Europe he lost heavily at Monte Carlo and Deauville. Teymourtache met him in. Europe in 1928, and persuaded him to return tO' Persia, which he did in 1929. Appointed Grand Master of Ceremonies at the Court in March 1929.. Sent to Europe on private business for the Shah in March 1930 and returned at the end of December. A reputation for honesty saved him from sharing his friend Teymourtache’s fall. Grand Master of Court Ceremonies (Foreign) 1938. Dismissed owing to royal irritability during the Crown Prince s wedding celebrations in April 1939, and retired to his estate at Kabud-Rahang, near Hamadan.

Born 1904. The eldest son of the late Isma’il Qashqai (Saulat-ud-Dauleh). Elected to the 8th Majlis as a member of the Qashqai. Ilkhani and the most influential chieftain of his tribe for a short time during 1930. Deprived of parliamentary immunity and arrested for conspiracy in 1932. Fled from Tehran during the general disorder in September 1941 and recovered his old position in Fars where he is now the accepted but not entirely undisputed, leader of the Qashqai. Is the onl\ one of the four brothers who is married. Does not smoke or drink and is a model family man. Tall, broadly built, staring eyes, slight smallpox marks on face, of commanding presence. A fast talker and a good raconteur. Fond of town society and, when living in civilised surroundings, is very reasonable and amenable. When living with the tribes he seems to lost his balance (where matters outside the parochial affairs of the tribes are E 228 ■ r •concerned) and to be easily misled. This instability probably results from his varied earlier experiences including imprisonment in Tehran with his father who died in captivity. Until the summer of 1945, when he eventually screwed up courage to come to Tehran, he seems to have been generally in fear of re-imprisonment. His anxiety to consolidate his position leads him, at the prompting of others, to see in himself a future Governor-General of Fars, Prime Minister and even Shah of Persia. Speaks a little English and understands much. He had two Germans with him in 1943 and made a landing ground intended for German aeroplanes near Farrashband. He rebelled in 1943 and was attacked by troops under Marshal Shahbakht but the operations were very half-hearted and soon fizzled out. In April 1944 he handed over the Germans who had taken refuge with him and undertook to co-operate with the Allies. Expresses hatred, disgust and distrust of the Persian Govern ment and says the army only moves to widen its range of extortion. Nasir visited Tehran in the summer of 1945 and was received in audience by the Shah from whom he is said to have received a general amnesty for the tribes.' One of his brothers, Muhammad Hussain, was a Deputy in the 14th Majlis, for Abadeh. Studied in England but left because of chronic asthma and studied economics at Berlin University. Voluble .speaker and very excitable, unreliable and not to be trusted. Khusru, another brother, is the youngest son of Saulat-ud-Dauleh and was born in 1921. The reprobate of the family. Great personal bravery and recklessness. Inherits his father’s cruelty and sadism: credited with a number of wanton killings. Was appointed Governor of Firuzabad in November 1943 but is never at his post, preferring to make frequent trips to Tehran. Made large sums of money by selling monopoly goods destined for the tribes at an enormous profit in the open market. Has personal charm, considerable powers of persuasion and a boundless capacity for making mischief. Is generally described as a “ child ” which is intended by some in excuse of his excesses and by others to mean that it is time he grew up. The fourth brother, Malik Mansur, was born in 1907 and studied at Heading University. Tall and lithe, hawk-like appearance, very attractive per sonality, talks much but slowly and tends to repeat himself. Speaks good English, German and a little French, Turkish and Turki. Reported to be loved by the tribespeople where Nasir is feared. Devoted to tribal pursuits of hunting and riding. Says that he will do his utmost to oppose any Government attempt at interference with the tribe and that he is prepared to fight the army. 137. Qawam, Ibrahim (Qawam-uZ-Mulk). Bom 1888. The son of Murza Habibullah Khan Qawain-ul-Mulk, who was killed accidentally in May 1916. During the war of 1914-18 was very friendly to us, and carried on his father’s traditional policy of opposition to the powerful Qashqai group of tribes headed by the late Ismail Khan Soulat-ud-Douleh. Having inherited vast properties in Fars from his father, as well as the titular headship of the “ Arab ” tribes of that province, he wielded immense authority in the south of Persia at the time of the coup d’Etat of 1921. Reza Khan (late Reza Shah) when Minister for War met the Qawam at Isfahan in August 1923 and expressed a wish that he should reside at Tehran; he therefore became elected to the Majlis as member for the Khamseh (Arab) tribes and thereafter has resided a good deal in Tehran. Always on terms of close friendship with His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, the Qawam engaged in 1926 a British agricultural expert to develop his vast estates; the experiment proved a failure through local opposition and the Qawam’s stinginess; the British expert left in 1928. In 1929 fled to Europe, doubtless having foreseen the Qashqai revolts of that year. Visited London 1929. Returned to Tehran the following year, having put his two boys to school at Beirut. His v^- properties were left in the hands of his servanva, who remitted him a monthly subvention. In 1929 various questions of validity of title to property were raised by the Ministry of Finance; and in 1931 the whole question was settled by the exchange of lands. The Qawam was given crown lands in Nishapur, in the neighbourhood of Tehran, and elsewhere in the centre of Persia, in exchange for his Fars properties. It is believed that he did well out of these transactions, and that he is one of the wealthiest landowners of Persia at present. In the ninth Majlis of 1933 he was a Deputy for Baluchistan. He had also accompanied Reza Shah on several of his journeys, and was generally supposed to enjoy His Majesty’s full confidence In November 1933, however, on the arrest of the Minister of War, Sardar Asad, while in attendance on the Shah at the Turcoman races, the Qawam seems to have become the object of suspicion, and he was placed under arrest with Asad. He is an attractive personality to meet. Very pro-British in sentiment, he sent his two sons (Ali Muhammad Qawam and Muhammad Reza Qawam) to England to be educated. Until his arrest he appeared to have settled down permanently as a peaceful courtier at Tehran. He plays polo, but does not mix much in society. Quiet in voice and retiring in manner, he is yet capable of driving a very hard bargain with his own countrymen. He does not appear to have much ambition. Though his name is still a household word at Shiraz, he cannot be considered a tribal leader in the sense that the Qashqai chiefs are; he is best considered as a Persian noble whose family had for some time held suzerainty over a group of tribes and who attained great wealth and influence in Fars, partly through backing the right side in the 1914 war. His son, Ali Muhammad, married Princess Ashraf Pahlavi in March 1937, but the marriage was dissolved. He had previously been an under graduate at Bristol University, where he did very badly. A daughter married Assadullah ‘Adam, son of Muhammad Ibrahim ‘Alam (Shaukat) in 1939. Played his part in the “events of 1941’’; he and his family at one time “ took bast ’’ in the British Legation at Gulhek; and when Reza Shah abdicated and went to Isfahan it was Qawam who was sent by the Government to obtain Reza’s signature to documents handing over his properties and private fortune to the State and to his son respectively. Visited India 1941-42 and bought a house at Bangalore. Sent back to Shiraz to help Marshal Shahbakhti with his attack on the Qashqais in June 1943. His elder son, Ali Muhammad, went to Washington as Assistant Military Attach^ at the end of 1941. Appointed Governor-General of Fars September 1943, but could not agree with any of the military chiefs about tribal policy, and returned to Tehran November 1943. He still enjoys considerable influence in Fars but resides generally in Tehran. The general tendency among his own family, whose obedience but not consciences he commands, is to regard him with the utmost respect as the survival of a day that is gone. He himself does not seem to be conscious of, or will not admit, this passage of time. His elder son, Ali Muhammad, has now returned from Washington.29 138. Qavam (Ghavam), Ahmed (Qawam-us- Saltaneh). A brother of Hassan Vossuq, than whom he is .younger by a few years. Began his career in the Ministry of Finance. Became Minister of War, July to October 1910, and Minister of Interior, ^^y to November 1911, and again in December ^^.1. Minister of Finance, July to August 1914, and Minister of Interior, November 1917 to January 1918. Appointed Governor-General of Khorassan April 1918 and remained there for three years, during which he administered the province with uniform success during troublous times. Became Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, June 1921 to January 1922, and again Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs from June 1922 to February 1923. Banished to Europe in October 1923, being accused of having plotted against the life of Reza Khan (Reza Shah). Was allowed to return to Tehran at the end of 1928 and arrived in March 1929, when he went to reside quietly on his property at Lahijan near Resht. Came back to live in Tehran after the fall of Reza Shah. Prime Minister, August 1942, after the fall of Soheily. Worked hard, but gradually surrounded himself with his own relations and friends. Tried hard to gain control of the Ministry of War, but failed to counteract the young Shah’s enthusiasm for the control of the army. The Shah’s opposition to him was shown in the disturbances of the 8th December 1942, in which Qavam did extremely well and undoubtedly performed a great public service in re-establishing governmental authority. Thereafter, howeyer, he became more and more involved in petty intrigues and favouritism, and had to resign in February 1943; since when he has been more or less openly accused of being the real instigator of the riots of December 1942. Believed to have been in touch with the Japanese Legation early in 1942, and to have received, when Prime Minister in 1942, messages from persons whom he knew to be German agents, without informing us. This was brought to the notice of the Shah in January 1944. A clever man, but sly, intriguing and unreliable. Has generally been friendly to His Majesty’s Embassy. Became Prime Minister in February 1946 with additional offices of Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Interior. His policy was to seek reconciliation with the Soviet Government. For this purpose he went to Moscow in February 1946. Responsible for the arrest of Sayyid Zia and General Arfa in March 1946, probably at Russian insistence.

He attached himself to Reza Khan, whose influence33 with General Starosselsky secured him promotion to the rank of colonel in 1919. After the coup d’Etat of 1921 he was appointed to command the Ahan regiment of infantry. In 1925 he was pro moted general and given command of an infantry brigade in Tehran. In 1926 he was sent to com mand the western division, but was recalled in the spring of 1928 for corruption; he, however, managed ingratiate himself with the Shah, and was appointed shortly afterwards to command the Persian troops in Kurdistan.

In his old age he seems to have become more arrogant and unapproachable. Sus pected of taking large bribes when at Kermanshah. An almost entirely uneducated survival from the Cossack Brigade, resembling in appearance and manners the more famous product of that corps, Reza Shah. Placed on retired list October 1943. 160. Shaibani, General Habibullah. Born about 1885, the son of Nazm-ed-Dowleh, who came of a middle-class family of Kashan. In 1906 Shaibani went to Saint-Cyr, where he graduated in 1910 and joined a French regiment. Returned to Persia in 1913, and was commissioned into the Swedish officered gendarmerie as a captain. He was highly regarded by the Swedish officers, and was promoted major in 1914.

He appears to have made contact with Reza Khan about 1920, and was working in his interests before the coup d’fitat. Promoted colonel in 1921, he served in the operations against the Jangalis and against Simitko. Promoted general of brigade in 1922, and in 1928 went to France in charge of Persian military students. He entered the French Staff College and graduated with distinction in 1925. He attended the Arms Traffic Conference at the League as Persian representative in the autumn of 1925, and was very sore at the success of the British representative in getting the Persian Gulf included in the Maritime Zone.

Appointed Minister of Public Works in May 1928 until December, when he lost that appointment and was placed en disponibilite. Appointed a member of the High Military Council in January 1929. Promoted general of division in June 1929, he was sent to command the army in Fars to deal with the rebellion in that province. He was suc cessful in restoring order, as the Qashgai, although in a fighting mood, were short of munitions. In 1930 he commanded the operations in the Mama- senni district and against the Kuhgelus, and by October he had succeeded in reducing the Kuhgelus, only one of the khans still refusing to make his submission to the Government. Shaibani is a man of independent views, and is somewhat rigid and narrow-minded. He is a strict disciplinarian, and does not play to the gallery. His [78—62] military ideas are conservative and sound, and he is perhaps the only French-trained officer who has not been led away from the realisation of realities. He regards Russia as the enemy of Persia; of the motives underlying British policy he has a fair understanding, and he thinks that Britain can and should help Persia in her own interests, but he believes that Britain will always sacrifice Persia if it should be in her interest to do so. He is intensely patriotic, and will stoutly oppose what ever he considers to be derogatory to Persian sovereignty or detrimental to Persian independence. At the same time he views with disfavour Persia's hasty efforts to play the role of a civilised nation. He is remarkably honest, direct in speech, and prompt in action. He has little sympathy with Persian officialdom. His nickname in the army is “ Feranghi, ” not by reason of any imitation of Europeans, but rather because of the un-Persian nature of his character. He speaks French fluently. Tried by a military court-martial in the autumn of 1931, on a charge of military inefficiency in his 1930 operations against the Mamasenni and the Boir Ahmedi tribes, resulting in some 500 Persian casualties.

Was Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry at the beginning of 1944. In February 1944 was Acting Minister of Commerce and Industry for a short while after the resignation of Nakah’l. He was removed from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in the summer of 1944 and remained without an appointment until August 1945, when he was appointed head of the Caspian Fisheries, a post which brought him into close touch with the Russians. Closely associated with Qavam-us- Saltaneh and joined the Cabinet as Minister for Commerce and Industry in 1946. An incorrigible intriguer and extremely corrupt even by Persian standards. He has tiae reputation of being a Russian spy, which is probably not underserved. 167. Suhaili (Soheily), Ali. Born about 1890. Educated partly in Russia and talks Russian well, also French and a little English. His career has been in various Govern ment administrations. In January 1931 vv^ appointed Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Roa^S and Communications under Kazimi. In September 1933 he was transferred to the Ministry for Foreign as Under-Secretary, when Kazimi was appointed Minister. Soheily had also served as chief Persian representative on the board of the Caspian Fisheries Directorate. Several times Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in the absence of his chief. Minister in London, March 1937. Minister for Foreign Affairs, May 1938, but dismissed in July, owing to the late Shah’s displeasure over a telegram concern ing the Paris Exhibition. Ustandar (Governor- General) of the VIHth Ustan (Kerman) February 1939. Ambassador, Kabul, October 1939. Became Prime Minister, rather unexpectedly, in March 1942, after having been Minister for Foreign Affairs in Feroughi’s Cabinet from September 1941 (during which time he was the Persian signatory of the Tripartite Treaty of February 1942). His Cabinet fell in July 1942, partly owing to lack of support from the Court and the army. Again Prime Minister on the fall of Qaw T am-es-Saltaneh in February 1943, once more unexpectedly; this time it was largely because Mu’tamin-ul-Mulk could not stand and the Majlis did not want the Shah’s candidate, Saed. Proved himself once more a hard worker, but carried little weight in the country and had to maintain himself by various “ combina tions ” and political deals with Majlis Deputies. A very reasonable, matter-of-fact person, with a businesslike manner. Hard working, and a good deal more approachable than some of his colleagues. In his contacts with this Legation he has always given the impression of his willingness to help and to arrive at a reasonable settlement. He is notoriously corrupt and has a well-deserved reputa tion of being a liar. He is quite prepared to agree to do anything but rarely keeps his word. During 1944^-45 he was frequently a strong candidate for the Premiership, but was suspected by many of being too well-disposed towards the Russians. Went to Egypt in the summer of 1945 and was made a member of the Persian delegation to U.N.O in January 1946. Remained in London. Still there May 1946. Has a Caucasian wife with a “ past ” and is universally suspected of having taken a great many bribes. 168. Sururi, Muhammad. Born about 1900. Served in various Government Departments, being one of the favoured young men selected by Davar, then Minister of Justice, when he revised the organisation of the Ministry in 1929. Has been judge in the Tehran courts, and Under secretary at the Ministry of Justice. Director of the Agricultural Bank 1942, but removed from that post June 1943. Posted to the Ministry of the Interior to look after it till Hajhir’s return, January 1944. Minister of Interior in Sa'id’s Cabinet of August 1944 and again in Bayat’s Cabinet in November 1944-Mune 1945. He did well, but in curred the displeasure of the Tudeh party when he arrested the worst of the professional toughs of Tehran and imprisoned them in Bandar Abbas. Businesslike and said to be honest. Lacking in real initiative, but carries out orders efficiently. 169. Taba, Dr. A bdul Hussein. Born in Tehran about 1911. Educated in medicine in England and qualified in medicine35 \Z3) and surgery after eight years in Birming ham and at Guy’s Hospital, lieal name is Tabatabai, of the Yezdi family of that name. Employed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company as a doctor 1940-42, and since practising in Tehran. A bright young man who seems keen on his pro fession. Married the youngest daughter of Vosugh- ediDouleh. 170. Tabatabai, Muhammad Sddiq. Second son of the late Seyyid Mohammad Tabatabai, who was a prominent figure in the Nationalist movement of 1906 to 1910. Born in Tehran about 1880. Elected to the third and fourth Majlises. In close touch with pro-Germans during the war of 1914-18. Emigrated to Turkey in 1916. Returned in 1918 and co-operated with Suleiman Mirza in forming the Socialist party. During this phase he was in close touch with the Soviet Embassy. Ambassador to Turkey 1924^-27. Recalled in 1927 and offered a post as a judge in the High Court of Appeal, but did not accept it. Speaks French. Said to be intelligent and hard working. Was more or less under arrest for about ten years in Tehran until the fall of Reza Shah 1941. Gradually entered political life after that and initiated and fostered the only Liberal party of Persia, called the “ Millat ” party (“ The Nation ”). Head oi the Election Committee for Tehran 1943-44, and himself elected Deputy. Aspires to becoming Prime Minister, but, though intelligent, has ruined his health by excessive opium-smoking. Elected President of the fourteenth Majlis. An opium addict for thirty years, he frequently found it difficult to keep awake when he was pre siding over the Majlis. Moreover, sessions could not last till after 1-30 p.m. because the time for his pipe had come. An incorrigible intriguer he stands close to the Shah to whom he has always offered bad advice, favouring a conciliatory policy towards Soviet aggression. His “ liberal ” ideas are not to be taken seriously. He and his friends pride them selves on their patriotism and the pursuit of the middle way between Britain and the U.S.S.R. For reasons unknown he is generally regarded as a “ national ” figure. Would like to be Prime Minister. 171. Tabatabai, Seyyid Zia-ud-Din. Born about 1893. Son of the late Seyyid Ali Yazdi Tabatabai. Edited the newspaper Rad (Thunder) in Tehran in 1915-16. Played a con siderable political role in 1917-18. Sent to Baku by Vosuq-ud-Dowleh in 1919 as Persian represen tative to Caucasian Azerbaijan; returned to Tehran in May 1920. Carried out coup d'fitat with the help of the Cossacks in February 1921, and seized the reins of office. Appointed Prime Minister with full powers by Ahmed Shah on the 1st March, 1921, and effected numerous arrests. His reforms were too radical for the country and the time, and he fell from power in June, fleeing the country. He has been in the tobacco business while exiled. Took a prominent part in the Pan-Islamic Con gress at Jerusalem in 1933. Said to have assisted Kazemi in the negotiations with Iraq at Geneva during 1935. In 1942, being by that time the owner of a very prosperous farm near Chazza in Palestine, which he had developed himself, he began to think of returning to his native country, and Muzaffar Firuz began with great energy and indiscretion to run a newspaper campaign in his favour in Tehran. He published a letter from the Seyyid in which the Russians were praised in fulsome language. His name came forward a good deal in the Tehran press during 1943, and quite a number of Deputies in the thirteenth Majlis seem to have favoured his return. [78—62] The Russians and the Shah, however, were stead* fastly opposed to his return, the former because they mistrusted Firuz’s unfortunate letter, and the latter through fear that the Seyyid might become a dictator. However, he returned to Tehran in September 1943 and was elected to the fourteenth Majlis from Yezd, his native place. Caused annoy ance by insisting on wearing a woollen hat of Caucasian style, and alienated some of his friends by an appearance of stubbornness and obstinacy. Founded a political party which in the summer of 1945 was officially launched under the name of “ Iradeh-i-Milli ” or National Will. His followers claimed that the party numbered about 9,000 in Tehran, at the end of 1945. Is the particular bug bear of the Tudeh and the Russians, who never tire of vilifying him as the arch-enemy of his country and the principal tool in Persia of imperialists, reactionaries, &amp;c. During the near-panic which prevailed in Tehran in November-December 1945 as a result of the approach of the Azerbaijan Democrats towards Qazvin many leading politicians and Deputies began seriously to consider that Seyyid Zia should be exiled from Persia as a sop to the Russians. Arrested by Qavam-us-Saltaneh on the 19th March, 1946. It is no exaggeration to say that Seyyid Zia rallied the anti-Tudeh forces in Persia and thus made it possible to resist intensive Soviet pressure when it came. Alone among Persians he has never allowed personal or even party interest to interfere with his policy. By his uncompromising resistance to Russian encroachments he became the symbol of Persia’s will to resist. Though suspicious of Sa‘id when he first came to power, he nevertheless sup ported him wholeheartedly when he proved that he was determined to resist Soviet demands. Simi larly, he strongly supported Hakimi’s foreign policy, although his party suffered severely at his hands. Again, when Qavam-us-Saltaneh did not surrender to the Soviets he gave him his support, although the latter has a personal feud with him since he was one of those imprisoned by him in 1921. A man of outstanding singleness of purpose and courage. Personally attractive, religious without being fanatical or obscurantist, he is at the same time short-tempered and impatient of criticism. These defects, however, were very much less notice able during the last few months of the fourteenth Majlis. He is both honest and energetic—a very rare combination in Persia. In matters non-political he tends to have very wild ideas which he defends with unreasonable obstinacy. The comparative lack of success of his party was due first to furious Soviet opposition, secondly, to his having been out of contact with the country for twenty-three years, and thirdly to the impossibility of reconciling his progressive ideas with the con servatism of many of his followers on whose financial aid he was dependent Speaks French and English. Has something of the mystic in him 172. Tadayun, Seyyid Muhammad. Born about 1884, a native of Birjand in East Persia; educated in Tehran, where he graduated and became a schoolmaster. After the split up of the original Democrat party in 1912, Tadayun became the leader of one of the more important Democrat factions. He was elected a Deputy from Tehran to the fourth term of the Majlis, and from Birjand to the fifth and sixth terms. Was elected President of the Majlis in the second half of the fifth term, and again at the beginning of the sixth term. In February 1927 he was appointed Minister of Edu cation, but in December he resigned that appoint ment owing to disagreement with his colleagues in the Cabinet, but he resumed office nine days later G36 U&lt; at the personal request of the Shah. On the 7th January, 1928, the Shah ordered him to resign, and his fall was said to be due to the personal animosity towards him of Teymourtache. In J une 1930 he was appointed Governor of Kerman. He was recalled from Kerman in March 1931, and he appears to believe that one reason for his recall was that he was too friendly with Lieutenant- Colonel Noel, then British Consul. Returned to politics on the fall of Reza Shah; was Minister of Education in Eeroughi’s Cabinet of 1941-42, and spoke eloquently in favour of the Tripartite Treaty of 1942. Minister of Food after Farrukh in 1942; resigned in July 1943. Minister of the Interior, September 1943, and did well in running the elections. But was not included in the reshuffled Cabinet of December 1943. The Russians, who for some reason are against him, seem to have secured his exclusion. 173. Tahei'i, Dr. Hadi. Born at Yezd about 1888. Son of a mulla. Land- owner and proprietor of various concerns at Yezd. A great rival of the Nawwab family of Yezd. Elected to the Majlis on various occasions, and has served as president of the Financial Commission of the Majlis. In the thirteenth Majlis was one of the vice-presidents and was considered one of the leading members of the Majlis. Served on the Committee of the Anglo-Iranian Relief Fund, 1943, and was helpful in providing local knowledge. Was largely responsible for the success of Seyyid Zia-ed- Din in the Yezd elections of 1943, thereby incurring the dislike and distrust of the Shah. Very friendly to us. Accused of various peculations at Yezd, but nothing has been proved, and he is considered one of the most solid and reliable Deputies. In the fourteenth Majlis he was, with Sayyid Kazim Jalili Yazdi, the most influential Deputy. Bitterly anti-Soviet he worked hard to maintain the Majlis majority against Soviet pressure. Though very slow in speech and manner he is extremely astute and had a profound knowledge of his Majlis colleagues and particularly of their weak points. Though patriotic he would not allow his patriotism to interfere unduly with his personal interests in Yezd. He has a congenital aversion to the obvious course and delights to achieve his objectives by devious means through the agency of others. It would be idle to pretend that he has progressive ideas. Although ostensibly on excellent terms with Sayyid Kazim Jalili, he is secretly jealous of him, a sentiment that is reciprocated. 174. Taqizadeh, Hassan. Born in Tabriz about 1880, the son of a small preacher. He was educated in his native town, and used to haunt the booksellers’ shops, where he showed great eagerness to acquire knowledge. In his early youth he was an ardent Nationalist, and was connected with the Nationalist movement in Persia from the beginning. He was elected to the first term of the Majlis and was one of its most prominent members. Mohammad Ali Shah hated and feared him, and, when the Shah made a coup d’fAat in 1908 against the Majlis, Taqizadeh took refuge in His Majesty’s Legation. The demand made by the Shah that he should be given up was refused, and Taqizadeh was eventually amnestied, on the condition that he went to Europe. He visited London and Cambridge, but returned to Tabriz at the end of 1908. He was elected to the second term of the Majlis in 1909, and, after the capture of Tehran by the Nationalist forces and the abdication of Muhammad Ali Shah in July 1909, Taqizadeh became a prominent member of the Nationalist Committee, which was set up to decide on the Government of the country. Went to Europe in 1910. He was elected in his absence to the third and fourth terms of the Majlis, but did not take his seat. He stayed in Europe and America during the whole period from 1914 to 1923, and was for years in Berlin, where he edited a paper called Kaveh. For publishing certain articles of an anti- Islamic nature he was excommunicated by the Mujtehids. He negotiated the Perso-Soviet Com mercial Treaty in Moscow in February 1921, ^md finally returned to Persia in 1924. He was ele^d to the fifth term of the Majlis 1924-26, and to the sixth term in 1926. He visited America again in 1926 as Persian delegate to the Philadelphia Exhi bition. Appointed Governor-General of Khorasan in January 1929; he was recalled in May and appointed Persian Minister in London, where he remained until April 1930, when he returned to Persia and became Minister of Roads and Communi cations. In August 1930 he was appointed Minister of Finance in addition. He is no longer so popular as he was in the early days of the Constitution, and the years have tempered his energy and zeal. His speeches in the Majlis marked him as a man of common sense and moderation. Taqizadeh fell from grace in September 1933, for reasons which are obscure. The Shah is said to have suspected him of intrigue with Majlis members in connexion with the purchase of gold. He was, however, soon re-employed as Minister in Paris. Recalled from Paris in August 1934, but obtained prolonged leave of absence and did not return to Persia. Appointed Iranian representative at the Congress of Orientalists at Rome in September 1935. He is married to a German and talks German fluently. He speaks English and French less well. Appointed Minister in London by Feroughi 1941, and has been suggested as Prime Minister on more than one occasion since then, but he has always preferred to stay in London. Became ambassador in 1944. Headed Persian Delegation to the U.N.O. in London in January 1946 and ably presented the Persian case when the Security Council considered the Perso-Russian dispute about Azerbaijan. Appointed to act as Persian representative in winding up the League of Nations in Geneva, March 1946. 175. Vasiqi (Vassighi), Sadiq (Sadegh). Born in 1898 at Tabriz, but of a Mazanderan family. Employed for many years in the Depart ment of Commerce of the Ministry of Public Works, and in the Ministry of Commerce since the former ministry was divided up. Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Commerce until April 1938, when he became Acting Minister on the dismissal of M. Ala. He has paid several visits to Europe, notably to Germany when the Clearing Agreement with that country was negotiated in 1935, and to Moscow in 1939, when the question of renewing the Russo- Iranian Trade Agreement arose. Head of Agricul tural Bank in 1942, but was removed to make room for one of Qawam-as-Saltaneh’s political nominees. Member of the board of the Iran Insurance Com pany, February 1943. Head of Mortgage Bank, December 1943. Secretary of the Perso-Soviet Cultural Relations Committee, February 1944. Member of the National Bank Supervisory Board, August 1945. Educated in Tehran at the Ecole Polytechnique (Dar-ul-Funun), and speaks French and English. 176. Vossuq, Hassan, G.C.B. (Vossuq-ed- Dowleh). Born about 1868. Began his career in the Ministry of Finance. Elected a Deputy to the first and second terms of the Majlis, and in 1909 chosen to be a member of the Nationalist Committee,37 which directed the affairs of State after the abdi cation of Muhammad Ali Shah. His first Cabinet appointment was as Minister of Justice in October 1909. In the following month he became Minster of Finance, but resigned in July 1910. In July 1911 he became Minister for Foreign Affairs. Again Minister for Foreign Affairs in January 1913, he left faz Europe in June of the same year. Minister for ■P’eign Affairs, July-August 1914, and Minister of Finance, August-December 1915. Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, August 1916 to May 1917. Prime Minister and Minister of Interior from August 1918 to June 1920. Negotiated the Anglo-Persian Convention of 1919. Visited Europe in June 1920, and only returned to Persia at the beginning of 1926. Appointed Minister of Finance in June 1926, but resigned in November to take his seat in Parliament. Elected as a Deputy from Tehran to the seventh term of the Majlis 1928—30. Appointed President of the new ‘ ‘ Academy ’ ’ for the revision of the Persian language, December 1935. A man of great ability and character. He became unpopular over the Anglo-Persian Convention, but, after a most able and convincing defence of his acts as Prime Minister during the period 1918-20 before the Majlis, he regained a large measure of popu larity. Went to Europe for a serious operation 1940; survived it, and is now reported to be living in Switzerland (1946), unable to return to Persia; he was appointed ambassador to Turkey by his brother, Qawam-es-Saltaneh- in 1942, but could not proceed. Speaks French fluently, also a little English. 177. Yezdan Penah, General Murteza. Born about 1891; son of Mirza Ali Akbar, a small shopkeeper in the village of Serdasht. In 1907 Murteza Khan entered the Cossack Cadet School. Eeceived his commission in 1912, showed strong pro-Russian sympathies, and consequently gained rapid promotion. Made lieutenant-colonel in 1919 and colonel in 1920. During the whole of his service he was intimate with Reza Khan, and accompanied him on the march to Tehran in February 1921 which culminated in the coup d’Etat. Was promoted general and given command of the Central Division. In July 1927 he fell from favour, and was put under arrest for a short time for an unknown reason. Whatever the suspicions against him were, they appear to have been unsubstantiated, for he was released very soon. In the autumn of 1928 he was appointed inspector of the gendarmerie, but was superseded in 1930 and left without any active command. Murteza Khan was always regarded until 1927 as a very loyal supporter of Reza Shah, but after his arrest in 1927 he appeared to have lost confidence in Reza Shah. He is active, intelligent, ambitious, and a strict disciplinarian. His military ideas and his general education are very limited, but he has shown anxiety to learn. He is not popular amongst the troops, but is feared and respected. Holds aloof from foreigners, and is a strong opponent of foreign interference in Persia. Inspector of Infantry in 1932. Commandant of Tehran Cadet College, 1933. On the fall of Reza Shah, Murteza Khan became Chief of the General Staff, and worked as a loyal supporter of the young Shah. On the appointment of Amir Ahmedi as Minister of War in 1943 it became apparent that the two could not work together, and Murteza’s department became quite separate’ from that of the Minister of War ; in fact, the Shah took to giving orders to the Chief of the Staff without the knowledge of the responsible Minister. Murteza took two months’ leave in June 1943, but was soon appointed commander of the Tehran garrison. Appointed adjutant-general to the Shah, autumn 1943, a post he still retains. Member of the Perso- Soviet Cultural Relations Committee, February 1944. Speaks Russian and has a Russian wife. Leader of military contingent chosen to represent Persia at Victory Parade in London, June 1946. Honest, genial and staunchly patriotic, he urged the Shah strongly to oppose the candidature of Qavam-us-Saltaneh in February 1946, but without success. Although he is one of the Shah’s closest advisers, he does not have a very high opinion of him personally, though he is devoted to the monarchy. He is one of the few senior army officers who are incorruptible. He is reputed to have had close relations with the Soviet Embassy, but this is most probably untrue. 178. Zahidi, Fazlvllah (Basir-i-Divan). Bom in Hamadan about 1883. His father was for many years in charge of the late Nasir-ul- Mulk’s property at Hamadan. Joined the Consti tutional movement and was wounded. Joined the Cossacks and thus came into contact with Reza Khan, under whom he served. Rose to the rank of general in 1921.

Turned his attention to business and became a partner in the “ Kazadema ” Ford agency. Reinstated in the rank of general 1932 and made A.D.C. to the Shah. Member of the Iranian commercial delegation to Russia in April 1935, and subsequently visited Central Europe. More of a politician than a soldier. Made a good deal of money in Khuzistan. Being capable of generosity he was not unpopular with the troops under his command. Married the daughter of Hussein Pimia (Mo’tamen-ul-Mulk) in 1927. Commanded troops at Isfahan 1942, and gradually took charge of all departments of Govern ment; proof was found that he was working with the Germans, and he was arrested by British troops and taken out of Persia in the autumn of 1942. Released in 1945. 179. Zand, Ibrahim (Ebrahim). Born about 1890. Educated at the Cadet College at St. Petersburg. Then sent to study law in France, where he was a contemporary and friend of Jawad Amery. Towards the end of the last war became an active member of the Musawat party in Azerbaijan, and in 1919 became a member of the short-lived Azerbaijan Government. After its fall he went back to France, and a few years after returned to Persia, where Davar employed him in the Ministry of Justice as an adviser. He was subsequently transferred to the Ministry of Finance, and in 1938 became a member of the board of the National Bank. On the appointment of A. H. Ebtehaj as director of that bank he left the bank and was employed at Court as Comptroller of the Royal accounts. Minister of War in Soheily’s third Cabinet, December 1943.

Educated at the Political School in Tehran, and employed in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in subsidiary posts for several years. In 1923 and 1924 was head of a section of the Ministry and was always very courteous and helpful whenever referred to by members of this Embassy. Served as “ chef de cabinet ” to Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan Feroughi while the latter was Minister for Foreign Affairs. He was subsequently posted to Washington, where he spent more than a year as secretary to the Persian Legation. He was recalled to Tehran in about 1927, and served in the Ministry of Justice for a time under Davar, at the time when the Ministry was being funda mentally reformed. He was for a time a judge of the Cour de Cassation.
