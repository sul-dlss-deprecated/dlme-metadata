Secret. Trans-Persian Railway. Minute by the Marquess of Crewe. ft is quite true that the question for our prompt decision is, “ must we regard the Railway as inevitable?” using the phrase, of course, in its technical application to any political future that can be foreseen and for which we ought to be prepared. If the answer is in the negative, we must definitely face the enquiry, “ Do we, and do the Government of India, prefer on the whole to see the Railway made ? ” I agree that the Government of India argue on the basis ol inevitability, not of preference, for the making of the line; and that if we are prepared to face the odium from some quarters and the disappointment from other quarters which will follow a plain statement that we see no prospect of granting our share of the concession, the Government of India will he relieved. The action to avoid is that which commits us so deeply that we have the choice of granting the concession while hating it. or of submitting to a plausible accusation of having lured the promoters to follow a will-o’-the-wisp. And w'e seem to me to be not far from such a position. 1 have always held that if there is to be a thorough connection, it ought to come about as most through connections have, by the building of service able local lines, and the linking of them as circumstances demand. That is the way in which one gets to Edinburgh, or Brindisi, or Petersburgh, or Constantinople, The Pacific and Siberian lines are on a different basis, and are really through lines ; but in those cases there was a distinct objective on a distant coast, and we do not admit that India offers an objective of that kind, or that she needs one.
