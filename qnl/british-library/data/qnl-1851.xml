To The Most Hon’ble the MARQUESS of CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 31st July 1913. Mr Lord Marquess, With reference to Your Lordship’s Secret despatch No. 9, dated the 10th February 1911, on the subject of the establishment of a regular Post Office at Kuwait, we have the honour to enclose, for Your Lordship’s inform- Letter No. 1485, dated the llth May 1913, with ution, the Diaiginally cited letter from euclosuro - the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. The need for a regular British Post Office at Kuwait has long been recognised and has been pressed upon us with some insistence by the local political authorities. The project has, however, hitherto been held in abeyance, lest the official announcement of the opening of a British Post Office might rouse the opposition of the Ottoman Government and prejudice the favourable settlement of questions which have formed the subject of the recent negotia tions with the Porte. 3. Now, however, that these negotiations are practically completed and a Convention seems likely to be concluded under which the Ottoman Govern ment expressly recognises the validity of our Postal Agreement of the 28th February 1904 with the Shaikh, the objections which have hitherto existed to the establishment of a Post Office no longer hold good. We trust, therefore, that Your Lordship will authorise us to take the necessary steps to substitute a. regular Post Office for the present informal arrangements so soon as the draft Convention has been ratified. 4. We consider that, as there can be no | question of competition with the post offices of other countries, Indian inland and Imperial Penny Postage rates may suitably apply as in the case of the post offices at Bahrain, Maskat and Gwadur, and we presume that the expenditure involved in the establishmentA— ' 1 2 of the post office, which will amount approximately to Bs. 1,170 a year, will be divisible between Home and Indian revenues.

Fro m CAPTAIN W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending will your Second Assistants endorsement No. 159, dated the 17th lanuarv idlt regarding the provision of an Indian Inland Post Office at this port. 2. Since my letter No 499, dated the iSth December 19.2 was written ; number of British subjects have come to Kuwait for work as carpenters, divers etc., and they find the greatest difficulty in remitting money to their families ii India, not having agents and others such as merchants on whom they mi&lt;rh draw as is done by the wealthier Arabs. The hardship is a very real one and 1 am compelled thereby to accept money orders from them for transmissioi hrough the Bushire Post Office, although the accommodation throws a consi derable amount of extra work on my office staff. 3. The trade of the town has increased by over 30 per cent during the past year from which fact it will be understood that a corresponding if not larger increase results in the postal work which still has to be performed by my office. Moreover more steamers call at the port now and have to be met for the ex- change of mails, entailing further reduction of the time available to my office establishment for its legitimate work. 4. The need of a post office is by far the most pressing necessity and dis advantage owing to the growth in its population, and to the expansion of its trade under which this town now labours and I would earnestly beg that you will k® s .° as^ to urge upon the Government of India the urgent necessity for alleviating what is one of the most hampering restrictions to the' general pros perity of this growing port, by the issue of very early orders for the establish- rnent of an Indian Inland Post Office similar to that at Bahrain. A room for the office, quarters for the Postmaster, furniture and office requirements are all available on the spot and as it would never be permitted that a Foreign Govern ment should establish a post office at this port I venture to think that no further grounds now exist for delaying any longer a most beneficial and, I would add, inevitable measure.

With reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 610, dated 24th. March, I have the honour to enclose, for the information of the Government of India, a further report from the Political 4y Agent at Kuwait, on the subject of the postal needs of that port. 2. In view of the fact that our negotiations with the Porte have apparently f been suspended for an indefinite period, and our postal agreement with the Sheikh of Kuwait has been communicated to the Porte wnthout raising any I specific protest from that quarter, there would seem to be ample justification for the regulation of our present postal arrangements at Kuwait on the lines suggested by Captain Shakespear without further delay. 3. As Captain Shakespear points out, the importance of the port is becom ing steadily enhanced, and its commerce, which is almost entirely with India, is now r increasingly hampered by the inadequate postal facilities which we are able to afford. There seems no necessity at present to make any formal announcement of the opening of the office: all that seems to be required is the deputation of a | postal official, nominally as clerk to Agency, and the unostentatious initiation of the postal facilities enjoyed by Maskat and Bahrain. 4. There seems no reason to anticipate that such action would cause any remark locally and in any case the situation has now so far changed that the considerations which were urged in 1910 by His Majesty’s Embassy, against the Tr&gt;J . r, • ^ . 1 formal opening of the post office would No. 475-E.A., dated 7th March i 9 ii. seem to nave lost much ot their weight. 5. The Superintendent of Post Offices, Persian Gulf Division, will shortly be visiting Bushire, and I beg that, should (Government take a favourable view of the above proposal, I may receive telegraphic intimation of the fact, in order to be in a position, if possible, to discjss the arrangements with him personally. No. 499 , dated Kuwait, the 18 th December 1912 . From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence regarding the provision of a regular Indian Post Office at this port ending with your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 1776 dated the 10th August 1912, and I would venture to enquire whether the early establishment of a Post Oifice, similar to that at Bahrain, may shortly be expected. 2. It will be remembered that Mr. J. B. Wood, C.I.E., when visiting Kuwait in March last on special duty concerned with the reduction of establishments, was sufficiently impressed with the extent of the postal work carried out at this port by my office to recommend the retention of a second clerk until such time as a regular Post Office should be opened. This recommendation the Govern ment of India were pleased to endorse and a second clerk was accordingly retained. 3. I venture now to revert to the subject at the urgent request of the small European community now established in Kuwait and of the large body of local merchants who find their business hampered to a very considerable degree by the want of the usual postal facilities which a town of a quarter of the size of Kuwait enjoys not only in India bat elswhere in the Persian Gulf. The only facilities at present available to the Kuwait public are the despatch and receipt C75FDof their letters at the exceedingly expensive Union rate of postage^ annas per letters containing curZcyTotnn^valuatle documents : they are also unable are delayed^at'least” a weelfin Bushire. How adversely ‘ h ' s dela y affe o« the mercantile community can be imagined when it is remembered that consignees are unable to clear their goods without production of Bills of Lading, which, instead of the present usual delay would reach Kuwait in registered let ers by the same mail ^ ‘he goods they cover if a local Post Office existed which could transact Registration work on the spot. The town is growing rapidly m commercial importance, a process which would he furthered by the extension of postal facilities, and I am convinced with profit to the Postal Department itself. a. No political considerations would now appear to stand in the way, for we have been under an agreement with the Ruler of Kuwait for over eight years To provide his port with a Post Office, whilst it is unthinkable that we should ever permit any Foreign Power to undertake that duty of civilization. Kuwait is now a port with a trade amounting to 63 lakhs of Rupees per annum, with a population of at least 40,000 souls, with a branch of the American M.ssion who are about to build a fully equipped hospital, with a weekly mail steamer service, with trade interests of sufficient magnitude to require a European Agent in Messrs. Gray Paul and Company’s business, with other interests of _ sufficient importance for the Government of India to contemplate openmg in the immediate future a wireless telegraph station and yet the port remains without the elementary necessity of a regular Post Office. A regular Post Office has become a vital necessity to Kuwait and for the reasons given above and those urged for many years past I would sohcit your most earnest support in bringing to the notice of the Government of India this most urgent need of the port of Kuwait. In conclusion I would beg that the Post Office may be opened at a very early date, at least with the beginning of the new financial year, and be similar to that in Bahrain, viz an Indian Inland Post Office.’ CONFIDENTIAL. No. 3521, dated Bushire, 29th December 1912, (received 6th January I9 1 3 ) F rom _-LiEUTENANT-COLONEL Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. In continuation of my letter, No. 3450, dated 22nd December 1912, regard ing the regularization of our existing postal arrangements at Kuwait, 1 have the honour to bring to the notice of the Government of India a specific case where we have informally established a British Post Office, not at a place which has a special status and with which we have special relations, but at a point on admit- tedly Turkish soil where Turkish officials are and have for many years been stationed. 2. I refer to Fao, where for many years we have maintained an^ informal postal service, postal business of various kinds being transacted, mails landed and despatched, etc., by an officer of the Indo-European Telegraph Department charged with the postal duties there, though Fao does not appear in the list of Indian Post Offices. At the present day sometimes as many as 40 bags are landed and a like number despatched during the week, as mails for Kuwait are landed at Fao fortnightly by the fast mail and transferred to the Agency launch for despatch to Kuwait. 3. My records do not show for how many years this system has been in force: it appears to have grown up gradually, and as far as l am aware never been challenged by the Turkish authorities, who recognize its existence in vari ous ways. I mention it not with the idea of suggesting any alteration of the system, which I should greatly deprecate, as its continuance is a great convenience locally, and of importance in connection with present and prospective postal arrangements, but simply in order to show that there are good grounds for the anticipation, expressed in my letter under reference, that the regularization and extension of postal facilities with Kuwait would not lead to any difficulties with the Porte, whose attention is unlikely to be drawm thereto.

With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department No. lOi. dated 6th March 1912, a.d eneloaorea. ^ ^ 0 ' 20'36.Est. A dated 10th July 1911, 1 venture with the highest respect to lay before Government a further report from the Political Agent at Kuwait on the subject of the needs of that port in the direction of postal facility. 2. In their communication above cited the Government of India accepted the view of the Post Office authorities that the postal work performed at Kuwait was very light and that even the modest facilities now afforded entailed considerable loss on the postal department. I cannot but think that a perusal of the present report will enable the Government of India and the Director General of the Post Office to modify their conclusions in regard to both these bearings of the question. 3. As to the extent of extra labour devolving on the 2nd Clerk of the Agency, the Foreign Department will now have before them incidentally the conclusions arrived at independently by Mr. J. B. Wood, O.I.E., who has lately paid a visit of inspection to the Kuwait Agency; while as to the business aspect of the project, the figures, presented by Captain Shakespear seem difficult to reconcile with conditions involving considerable loss. At least it would appear that the postal business which would fall to a fully fledged Post Office in Kuwait would he sufficient to enable the institution to pay its way. 4. It remains to consider the present aspect of the proposal to substitute a formal British Post Office for the unofficial arrangement of the past, from the political point of view. In this regard I am not unmindful of the misgivings entertained by His Majesty’s Embassy as late as the date of Mr. Marling’s despatch of 21st December 1910 to His Majesty’s Foreign Office, but since then the atmosphere has apparently cleared ; the text of our Postal Agreement with Shaikh Mubarak has in fact been communicated to the Porte with the Foreign Office Note of 24th October 1911 to the Ottoman Ambassador. I trust, therefore, that as soon as the state of the negotiations now in pro gress with the Turkish Government admits of the change politically, the Govern ment of India will see their way to proceed with it.

Buahire letter No. 1188, dated 7th May 1911. Foreign Department letter No. 2036-Fst. A., dated 10th Jmy 1911. 2. It is with some diffidence that I venture to revert to the subject in view of the decision of Government previously expressed, but the matter has now assumed such importance that in the interests of the community and o our own political and commercial position in Kuwait lam constrained to plead for a reconsideration of the project. 3 . I have attached hereto a tabular statement and an explanatory memo randum in an endeavour to show by figures the enormous increase in the postal2 business of the port. The figures of actuals cover 26 consecutive months and have been carefully checked. This check led to the discovery of some errors in the statement forwarded with my letter No. 180 of the 16th April 1911 which however, do not affect tne conclusions then reached. I venture to submit that the figures showing the increases per centum for each period over that preced ing are sufficiently striking in themselves to warrant fully my assertion that there has been an enormous increase in the postal work done by my office establishment. J 4. From letter No. 2036-Est, A., dated the 10th July 1911, from the Gov ernment of India in the Foreign Department, to your address, I gather that the postal authorities consider the work at Kuwait extremely light and that its execution already entails a loss to the Post Office. So far as I am aware this work costs the Post Office only Rs. 240 per annum (the salary of the postal peon) and some of the time of the Postmaster at Bushire, the rest of it bein? performed by my head clerk without remuneration. When the sale of post age labels at Kuwait alone exceeds Rs. 400 per annum I confess that, without further figures not available to me, the loss seems inexplicable iu present cir 5. There remains the consideration of the political reasons for which I understand the project of a regular post office in Kuwait was in the main negatived. IVly office is treated by the local public exactly as a post office there is a special room for the work, and the usual red letter-box fixed in a wall so that to all outward appearance there is already a post office, and that this impression prevails in Basrah and elsewhere there seems to be no doubt The formal opening of a regular post office would not attract particular notice! whether notification to the International Bureau would be remarked upon and noticed by the Ottoman Government in any seriously prejudicial manner cannot be foretold with any certainty, but nothing beyond a formal protest, and perhaps some of the usual allegations of the anti-British press in Con- stantinople, appears likely. On the other hand British protests in defence of o laik i Mubaiak s rights do not appear hitherto to have met with such atten tion as to make us sensitive to Turkish susceptibilities. Moreover we have earned on the postal work in Kuwait now for over seven years, and presumably would not i egard with equanimity its transfer to any other hands. Further the settlement of the American Mission, the increase in trade, the continual growth of the town and its commercial prosperity make the matter of urgent importance as affecting our predominent share in its trade. the merits of the proposal itself with the data available and sub- nutied herewith I would plead for a re-consideration of the subject with he lecommendation that the Post Office, should the Government of India see then way. to establishing one, may be an Indian inland office similar to that at Bahrain. 7. In this letter I have not adverted to a former proposal with regard to the retention of my second derk for the work if a regular post office should still be found infeasible, for the reason that (though my office work together w ith the postal work will be beyond the capabilities of one head clerk) it is now of far more importance than formerly in the commercial interests of the town that a regular post office should be established without delay.Sub-Enclosure 2. Memorandum on postal toork done at Political Agency, Kuwait, Attention is invited to tbe attached tabular statement as showing at a glance the very great increase in postal business in Kuwait. The first part of the statement gives the actual figures for three periods of 4 months, 11 months /) and 11 months respectively, but a better comparison is furnished by the latter half in which these actual figures have been expanded into the form of annual averages. 2. Column (a) of the statement gives the outward money-order business and it is worth noting that the figures represent only those money-orders booked on behalf of the Agency Staff, as no money-orders are accepted from the general public, though the office is continually being asked to book them. A regular post office would do an immense amount of business in this branch as I believe is the case at all other Persian Gulf post offices especially at those on the Arab Coast. 3. The same remarks apply to outward parcels business. 4. The increase in inward money-orders, parcels and registered articles is enormous (455, 173 and 130 percent in eleven months respectively). It is this work particularly which takes so much of the time of my office establish ment from its legitimate work ; payments have to be made, receipts obtained and accounts furnished weekly to the Eushire Post Office. 5. It has not been possible to take account of the inward letters, but the increase judging roughly by quantity has been on the same scale. A count of a few outward mails gave an average of 227 letters a week, that is some 12,000 per annum. A large number, however, are posted on board steamers to obtain a lower rate of postage and are not included in these figures. Although not all tbe stamps affixed to outward letters are actually bought in Kuwait there has been a heavy increase of 119 per cent in the last eleven months in the stamps sold to the public. Another column, that for overdue and bearing postage recovered, for which unfortunately I have no previous figures, serves to give an idea of how heavy tbe inward mail must be, when no less than Its. 94 is recovered in eleven months on this account alone. 6 . So much for the figures available which it would be interesting to com pare with other Gulf ports. Lingah would furnish the best comparison as having, like Kuwait, an insignificant through post to other places in the interior. On the score of population however, Kuwait, with at least 40,000 inhabitants as against some 12,000 in Lingah, would seem likely to furnish a better return on the necessary expenditure of a post office. Moreover, the town is growing, trade is increasing and as the amenities of civilization become better appreciated, the need of ordinarily free postal facility becomes more and more urgent. The recent establishment of a branch of ihe American Mission, with three Europeans resident in Kuwait makes that need more than ever apparent. During the last four months (November to February) the increase in the inward mail has been remarkable, over 1,000 parcels, over Rs. 1,700 in money- orders and over 1,200 registered articles having been received; these figures show no signs of remaining stationary, much less of diminution, and urgently proclaim the insistent want of a regular post office. 7. If the figures given above and in the attached statement are those obtainable from and in spite of the work being carried on in an office which by its nature cannot undertake any of the revenue-paying business of the post office, how much more is the establishment of a regular post office likely to expand postal business and revenue, especially if the present Union rates are lowered to the inland Indian rates prevailing at Maskat and Tahrain.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Despatch No. 357 of the 9th instant, relative to the proposed establishment of a British post office at Koweit. As you are hware, the late Sir N. O’Conor deprecated this proposal in 1904 as being likel} 7 - to have a bad effect and to prejudice our chances of obtaining recognition for the Sheikh of Koweit’s claims over Bubiyan, and the effect of such a step at the present moment would, in my opinion, be still more prejudicial. The national ideals of the Committee Govern ment of Constantinople run counter to our vested interests in Koweit and other places at the head of the Persian Gulf, and the young Turks consequently expect us to oppose the realisation of those ideals, but they are marking time until they feel themselves financially strong enough to take overt action. The present time may therefore be regarded as a period of truce, but the official announcement of the opening of the British post office at Koweit would be interpreted by. the Ottoman Government as an open act of hostility on the part of His Majesty’s Government, and an acute anti-British agitation in the press would probably be worked up, with results probably injurious to our interests in Mesopotamia and elsewhere. It would thus seem to be for His Majesty’s Government to decide whether the advantage to be derived from converting an unofficial post office into an official one is sufficient to counterbalance the increase of ill- will in Young Turkey circles which such action would occasion. It is to be remembered that the Turks regard the status quo in Koweit as meaning that that district is an integral portion of the Ottoman Empire, and they probably expect that the question of their sovereign rights, now in abeyance, will be settled in their favour simultaneously with the solution of the question of the Persian Gulf-Bagdad section of the Bagdad Railway.

What brought the matter to Hakki Pasha’s mind was no doubt Sir Henry’s aUusion to Ismail Hakki Babanzades recently published reports on Mesopotamia and the neighbouring regions, and more particularly the violent article from his pen which appeared m the ^ Tanm ” of the 28th December, and which was specially devoted to British action in Koweit and British relations with the Sheikh of Mohammerah fsee y 15 ° f ,? akki Paska kad &gt; however, just previously spoken of mav^be^i^e^red^th' ^^°f Koweit, a gam reverted to it, s^ that it may be inferred that the Grand Vizier for. the moment had, as was suggested in Sir Gerard Lowther s despatch No. 603 of the 29th August last, like the Young Turks conceived the idea of making the solution of the two questions interdependent no T lt 1 s ® ems P roba ble that the question of Koweit will be raised at no d stant date, if indeed it is not, as Ismail Hakki counsels, forced upon us. This fnt mg + n ’ Cy p S ’ 1 thmk ’ unllkel y &gt; but I venture to suggest that it might be well for His Majesty s Government to consider whether in the event of the Porte inviting us to djscuss the Koweit question it will be more expedient to enter into pourparler! attitude^f °the ^ eg0tiaPon % f T ° T r little time. Looking at the present aggressive eG and Pr0gress ’ whicl1 ’ as are aware &gt; is Ibe real L fpr ,- ga d p g affairs of Turkey, postponement would seem the wiser course.

It is not, perhaps, out of place to remark here that [1852 i—l] * Already printed: see [636] and [637].2 by her recent pourparlers with Germany Russia appears inclined to disinterest herself in the southern sections of the railway. In my despatch No. 942 of the 29th ultimo I expressed the opinion that too much importance need not be attached to the advances made by Rifaat Pasha to us for a renewal of negotiations for a solution of the railway question, but it is quite possible that if that question and that of Koweit were treated together we should find genuine and effective desire on the part of the Turks to come to an agreement. T1 ^ prospect of gaining something at Koweit would be a powerful inducement to them to obtain from the Germans the latitude requisite for them to satisfy our requirements in the railway question. It should be remembered that the main object in view when eleven years ago, we entered into relations with Sheikh Mubarak was to prevent the Bagdad Railway from reaching the shores of the Gulf except under conditions consonant with our interests, and I venture to suggest that it is worth while considering whether the moment is not now approaching when we should endeavour to turn our acquired position at Koweit to account, and whether, if we do not now seize the opportunity, we may not eventually find that we have saddled ourselves with responsibilities towards the sheikh involving us in particularly thorny questions vis-d-vis of the Turks, without having reaped any commensurate advantage. Our position as regards the actual terminus of the railway at Koweit may still be secure owing to the agreement of October 1907, but we might now use the leverage offered to us by the Turkish anxiety to settle the Koweit question to secure our interests on the Bagdad-Bussorah sections; whereas if we do not, and if we allow the line to reach Bussorah under purely German control, it appears to me that a very awkward situation might arise. A great difficulty in seeking a solution of the Koweit question at present will be to find a basis of negotiation. Turkish aspirations will, of course, be satisfied with nothing short of an acknowledgment of Ottoman sovereignty over the sheikh and his dependencies, but we have unfortunately, if I may say so, been led into such intimate relations with him that it would be impossible for us, with the examples of Albania and Macedonia before us, to abandon him to the tender mercies of the Turks. The loss of reputation to us both in Arabia and Persia would be immense, nor would the native mind be capable of appreciating the importance of the advantages we should have gained in connection with the railway, but would readily credit the Turkish version that we had been compelled to yield to the superior power of the present Government of Turkey. But on the importance of this in relation to our position in the Persian Gulf His Majesty’s Government will no doubt take the opinion of the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING.The Secretary to the Government ol India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. i'U With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter Eo. 2330-1.A., dated 2nd lovemher 1910, I have the honour to forward a copy of a further lo. 652, dated 22nd lovember 1910. | communication from the political Agent, Kuwait, in which he again presses the question of the establishment of a regular Post Office at Kuwait under Indian “Rules as at Bahrain.

I have the honour to invite a reference to the orreBpondenee, regarding the institution oi a regular Post Office at Kuwait, ending with your First Assistant's endorsement No. 3059, dated the 15th November 1910 E. I find that the postal work is increasing steadily and fudging from the increased sale of stamps I am inclined to think that the figures given in the memorandum attached to my letter No. 346 of the 30th May 1910 give v an estimate which is considerably below the actual work as it exists now. 3. I am, however, constrained to submit this letter by the frequent questions addressed to me in conversation by leading and other merchants, anxious in their business interests, to know why a regular Post-Office is not provided at Kuwait as at Bahrain, with the same facilities of ' ngBSS&amp;BBBSSBBBBHHBaMBHof the Indian Inland rates of postage; - at present the official Post-Office for Kuwait is pushire and oonsaquent- ly all postal matter, inward and outward, is subject to the comparatively heavy tjnion rates of postage. The point occurred to me when addressing you before but I did no. then presskt; after further consideration, however, I would submit that if His Majesty's lovermaent approve the principle of a regular Post-Office in Kuwait, the ofxice should be established under postal rules for postage etc., analagous to Bahrain and Easkat. Buch a course has the further advantage oi avoiding any appearance of tacitly acknowledging Turkish authority as might he argued from an office working under rules for postage etc., similar to those of the Basrah and Baghdad Offices. 4. The lower rates of postage would he a great boon to the community and with a regular Post-Office would lead to a larwe increase in the postal matter and consequently I revenue. As the institution of an office so closely affects our own political interests as well as the com- mercial prosperity of the port I would earnestly heg your support in recommending the early opening ox regular Post- Office with Indian Inland postage rates similar to Bahrain and Maskat.

My Lobd, We have the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty’s Government, copies of the papers cited in the annexed schedule on the subject of the proposed opening of a Post Office at Koweit. 2. The question was first considered by Lord Curzon’s Government in 1902, and it was decided* to let the * Enclosures i to 4. matter lie over until a regular steamer service had been opened with Koweit. It was again raised in Lord Curzon s telegram, dated the 16th January 1904, to the address of Your Lordship s prede cessor, when it was proposed to appoint a Native medical subordinate to hold charo-e of a Post Office and also to do medical work. In reply, His Majesty s Government, in a telegram dated the 19th February 1904, approved the proposal, and considered that the Sheikh should undertake not to allow the establish ment of Post Offices of other countries in Koweit. Such an undertaking was obtained! from the Sheikh, and steps were t Enclosure 5 . taken to depute an Assistant Surgeon and a postal peon to Koweit.

Persian Gulf Residency, but, as we understood that Your Lordship was not prepared to consider the scheme for a2 cable communication with Koweit, referred to in our Secret despatch, No. 116 (External), dated the 11th July 1907, it was consequently considered undesir able at the moment to re-open the Post Office question. 3. Colonel Cox now submits a further representation* from the Political Agent at Koweit in favour of the • Enclosures. establishment of a regular Post Office. The Political Agent urges that postal work has been steadily growing, and that bis office has become practically a Post Office and is recognised as such in Koweit. Colonel Cox considers the project in any case of sufficient importance politically to make it worth our while to proceed with it. 4. We understand that the representations which have, from time to time, Vide our Secret despatch No. 116 (External), dated been addressed to the Porte by His the nth July 1907. Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, regarding the maintenance of a Turkish military post on the island of Bubiyan, have not been successful. Further, His Majesty’s Government recently decided not to raise the question of the Sheikh of Koweit’s rights to Bubiyan, which t vide letter from sir n. O'Conor to th. ^ be Briti9h Ambassador had put forwardf Marquis of Lansdowne, No. 372 (Confidential), dated in 1904, but which the Porte Contested. the ioth May 1904. jj. j s p 0ss jt)le, therefore, that there is no longer the same need as in 1904 to refrain from putting forward the proposal regarding the establishment of a Post Office at Koweit, especially in view of the previously expressed wish of the Sheikh, the commercial convenience which it would afford to the public as evidenced by the increasing amount of postal work, and the possible establishment in the future of a wireless tele graphic installation at Koweit. We accordingly trust that His Majesty’s Government will agree to the establishment of a regular Post Office. The Director-General of the Post Office of India sees no objection to the proposal from a postal point of view, though he is unable to approve the suggestion in paragraph 3 of Colonel Cox’s letter No. 1628, dated the 19th June 1910, that international notice of the opening of the Post Office should be deferred until the improved arrangements have been working for some time. 5. In the event of the proposal being approved by His Majesty’s Gov ernment, we presume, with reference to Your Lordship’s telegram dated the 3rd June 1910, that expendituie incurred in connection with the establish ment of the Post Office will be divisible between the Home and Indian Gov ernments, and we propose to submit a further report on the subject on receipt of Your Lordship’s reply.

It is unnecessary for me to express any opinion on the conduct of the Postmaster, which will, I have no doubt, he judged by his official superiors, hut I can vouch for the fact that there has been, even in my own household, a good deal of discontent with the way withdrawals from the Post Office Savings Bank have been dealt with and, in the opinion of those making withdrawals, the frivol ous objections raised and the delay caused thereby. 3. I do not allude to this discontent with a view of making trouble for the local Postmaster, Bushire, but because I venture to think that it affords argu ment for the establishment of a regular post office in Koweit. Many of the former objections now no longer exist. I trust this summer to see good and commodious building erected in the dispensary quarters which will afford ample room for the proper transaction of postal affairs, and I would ask that the question of establishing a regular post office may be again taken up and that any possible diplomatic difficulties may be removed before the cold weather, so that during his cold weather tour in the Gulf, the inspecting postal authority may be able to open a regular post office here. I can confidently promise that there will be no local difficulty.From— Lieutenant-Colonel P.Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, -The Hon’ble Mr. S. H. Butler, C.S.I, C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Residency letter No. i 49 °&gt; d a t e d 17th May I9°8, to your address on the subject of existing postal arrangernents at Koweit, and to submit a further representation from the Political Agent in favour of the establishment of a regular office. 2. We are already credited by the Turkish authorities and the public with having a Post office at Koweit, so that it is not a question of our breaking fresh ground. All we shall be doing will be to convert a very partially effective arrangement into a more fully effective one. 3. The course suggested in Captain Shakespear’s concluding paragraph commends itself to me as best calculated to enable us to introduce the new office with the least trouble ; and it would, I think, be additionally convenient if it were possible for the Postal authorities, by withholding some technical but unimport- and attribute essential to a “ regular ” office under international rules, to delay international notice of the opening of the office until the improved arrangements have been working for some time. 4. I do not feel in a position to say much as to the prospects of a regular office from a financial point of view : but whether it is likely to be self-supporting or not for the first few years, the establishment of one appears to me to be suffi ciently important politically to make it worth our while proceeding with the project in any case, I trust therefore that the Government of India will now feel able to give the proposal their favourable and lively consideration. No. 346, dated Koweit, the 30th May 1910 (Confidential). From— CAPTAIN W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.L, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to submit for reconsideration the subject of the establish ment of a regular Post office at Koweit. 2. My predecessor advocated the opening of a properly equipped office in his letter No. 135, dated the 25th March 1908, and his proposal had the support of the Residency, but Government were then not prepared to proceed with the matter. 3. To obtain some idea of the extent of postal work at present carried out in my office 1 caused the records to be scrutinized and mails to be counted. From the results obtained the attached memorandum of the annual postal work has been compiled, in order that a definite basis may be available for estimating cost and expenditure. 4. The Postmaster-General will be able to form a better estimate than I can of the probable revenue from the figures in the attached memorandum,^ but I would observe that hitherto the most valuable sources, viz., registration, of letters and parcels, sale of postage-labels, and booking of money-orders have yielded practically nothing, and it is the want of these very facilities that is most felt by the public. The population of the port is estimated at anything between ^ 30,000 and W&gt;oo, and it has large dealings with Indian, Bahrein and other Persian Gulf Ports ; it would seem certain, therefore, that the postal revenue would not be below that of Bandar Abbas or Bahrein. k. I am not able to form an estimate of the establishment in the event of an office being opened but submit the following considerations as likely to influence an estimate (a) A 4:00m for a Post office can be made available in the Agency if s ®^ ' in a convenient position for the public and consequently there would be no charge for rent. Office furniture has already been suppliedcomplete for a branch Post office, forms, seats, etc., and is all available on the spot (vide letter No. 1575-E.A., dated the 13th May 1904 , from the Under Secretary, Foreign Department, Gov ernment of India, to the Chief Secretary, Government of Bengal, forwarded under your endorsement No. I 573 &gt; dated the 26th December 1904 ). (b) The Postmaster would have to find lodging in the town outside the Agency premises for there is no spare accommodation at present and none could be made available without acquiring more ground. (t) There is at present a mail peon attached to the Agency whose salary (amounting to Rs. 20 per mensem) is met from the Agency Budget. This peon could be retained as he knows the work and his salary would be charged to the Postal Department. (cf) The mails are taken to and from steamers at present ^ by my Head clerk in the Agency boat. There would be no objection to this procedure being continued with the substitution of the Postmaster for the Agency clerk. Or, if preferred, arrangements could be made for the transport of the mails in the B. I. S. N r Company’s Agent’s boat as is done at other ports. The above gives all the details which I can at present foresee as likely to affect an estimate of revenue and expenditure. 6 I will turn to former objections to the office which I understand to have been political and raised by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. Ihe present system has been in force since the inception of this Agency and the work has grown year by year until my office has become, in addition to its legitimate rdle practically (with the exceptions noted above in paragraph 4) a Post office and is regarded as such in Koweit. The Sheikh would not, I feel convinced, have any objection to the establishment of a regular Post office, even if it is considered necessary that he should be consulted in the matter, a course which in my opinion is quite unnecessary and one which would only invite opposition in a hope that some more tangible benefit might be extracted from Government. Some opposition may be expected from the Turkish Government when the opening 01 a Branch Post office at Koweit is notified under International Postal Rules but, in the circumstances, it does not appear possible for it to be serious, nor indeed difficult to meet. In Basrah it is well-known that the postal arrangements ot Koweit are in our hands and I imagine it is generally presumed that a regular Post office already exists. The Wali himself is aware of it, judging by a conver sation with him which Sheikh Mubarak reported to me some time ago, and in view of the existence of British Indian Post offices in^ Baghdad and Basrah to gether with our exceptional commercial and political position in Koweit, he wou have some considerable difficulty in finding any solid argument against our office. If I may venture to hazard a suggestion for bringing about the desired object with as little ostentation as possible it would be that Government request the Postmaster General to detail a Sub-Postmaster for Koweiton arrival he should take over my Head clerk’s postal duties, his presence being explained to the Sheikh by me as the result of the increase in postal work and consequently Government’s decision to put it on a proper footing. Having assumed his charge, the Postmaster-General could then issue the necessary notification dec laring a Branch Post office open in Koweit. The Post office will thus be a “ fait accompli' before any objections can be raised, to combat which we have the cogent arguments outlined above. » Memorandum of postal work at Koweit Political Agency. The following figures have been arrived at from a scrutiny of the records for the first four months of 1910. A count was also taken for 5 consecutive mails of the number of letters despatched in the Agency bags. f\( 0 ) Value of money-orders despatched from Koweit, via, the Bushire Post office (5) Value of money-orders received for delivery and pay ment in Koweit ... ... ... ... (r) Value of stamps sold in 1909 ... ... ... Value of stamps sold in 5 months of 1910 ... (d) Number of parcels received for delivery ... ... (e) Number of registered articles received for delivery ... (f) Number of letters despatched from Koweit 4 , 35 ° per annum. 150 per annum. 131 101 470 per annum. 740 per annum. 7&gt;3 10 P er annum. To explain these figures further it may be added that the value of^ (a) money-orders despatched represents only the value of value-payable articles recovered and such money-orders as members of the establishment wish to send. Money-orders from the public are not accepted. The same remark applies to (0) for Koweit not having been notified as a Post office money-orders are not accep ted in India or elsewhere for the port. (c) The value of stamps sold is considerably below the actual number of stamps used on correspondence despatched from Koweit as numbers of the people at present obtain their supply of postage labels from friends in Bushire or India and the figures given represent little more than the consumption of the Agency Establishment. No parcels for despatch nor articles for registration are accepted and con sequently nothing can appear under these heads though from the figures for receipts of these two items for delivery an idea can be formed that there would be a considerable amount of such postal business. The number of letters despatched (f) does not nearly represent the total correspondence leaving Koweit for a considerable number of letters are earned personally by passengers for posting on board or e sewbere to obtain the benefit of a lower rate and also frequently for want of stamps. The tmmber of letters received I have not been able to have counted, but it is certainly not far short of double the outgoing number. The above details are given in order that an approximate estimate of revenue maybe possible. Koweit ; jolh May igio ' ] W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Captain, Political Agent, Koweit. h t. B. C 2063 F.

Sir, _ Foreign Office, October 17, 1910. I HAVE received your Excellency’s despatch No. 003 of the 22nd August and other reports, in which you enumerate repeated instances of the arbitrary and vexations treatment of British subjects in Asiatic Turkey, and, further, draw my attention to the number of incidents of political aggression, all tending to a disturbance of the status quo, which have recently marked the conduct of the Ottoman authorities in the region of the Persian Gulf. It will be convenient to deal first with the injustice to which British commercial iiiterests have been subjected. In July the representative of Messrs. Lynch and Co. at Bagdad was informed that certain property of his firm would, under a municipal regulation, be demolished as insecure and dangerous. The British Consul-General found that the property, which he took an early opportunity of inspecting, was perfectly safe. A few days later a notification was made to Messrs. Abdul Ali, a British-Indian firm, respecting the projected demolition, on similar grounds, of their principal shop and the arbitrary expropriation of the site, which is a valuable one. This property was likewise found, on inspection, to be in excellent condition and in no wise dangerous. The British Consul-General hereupon visited the President of the Municipality and protested vigorously against the wanton destruction of property on a false pretext of danger to the public. The conclusion drawn by His Majesty’s Consul-General was that, in the absence of funds to meet the cost of legal expropriation, the procedure complained of had been adopted. Notwithstanding that your Excellency had in the meantime made urgent representations through the Minister of the Interior, an extensive demolition of Messrs. Lynch’s property, including their chief office, was begun on the 7th August, and more recently His Majesty’s Consul-General has reported that the property of British subjects already demolished and threatened means a loss of some £ T. 5,000; while he learns that it is proposed to enforce further expropriations, at great loss to many British subjects resident in Bagdad. On the 29th September your Excellency reported that British-Indian property at Kazimia and Kerbela had likewise been demolished, and that the Yah had declined any indemnification on grounds which are wholly unconvincing. His Majesty’s Government must emphatically protest against this procedure ; they must further, in view of the fact that it has originated with the Vali, hold the Ottoman Government themselves responsible for the damage already inflicted, and, after receiving a report as to its precise extent from His Majesty’s Consul-General, your Excellency should present a detailed claim to the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs. Before leaving the question of these expropriations, I think it necessary to advert to the rumoured intention of the Yali of Bagdad to cause a new road to be constructed through the middle of the grounds of His Majesty’s Consulate-General, whereas by making a slight deviation it might be made to follow an existing road : it is true that after your Excellency had made representations to the Sublime Porte, the Yali asserted to His Majesty’s Consul-General that no interference with the Consulate buildings had been in contemplation: I feel constrained to observe that the local evidence to the contrary effect is of a conclusive character. Two further cases of unwarrantable interference with British interests have also recently occurred at Bagdad :— In the first of these cases Messrs. Abdul Ali, the British-Indian firm already referred to, were suddenly ordered to sell the ice manufactured by them at a reduced rate of 10 paras a kilogramme instead of 20 paras an oke, their usual charge : I understand that owing to non-compliance with this arbitrary order the local authorities have threatened to close by force two ice factories belonging to British Indian subjects. [2930 r—4] \9 In the second case two British firms, Messrs. Blockey Cree and Co. and Messrs. Blanev and Solomon, were informed that they must transfer their factories to the outskirts of the town, on the pretext of a regulation 46 years old concerning steam- eno-ines and boilers, whereas, as vour Excellency has pointed out to me, the factories m question are run by smokeless oil-engines, which are m no respect dangerous. / There is clearly therefore, no ground whatever for the application of the regulation to these factories, and its enforcement would be wholly unreasonable and very burdensome to the owners. Your Excellency should insist upon satisfaction being accorded to all these British subjects and afford to them the full and effectual piotection of His Majesty s Government who cannot admit a continuance of the oppression to which they are being subjected. You should add that His Majesty’s Government cannot be expected to acquiesce in the helplessness expressed by the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs with regard to the illegal proceedings of the Bagdad authorities, and that such helplessness on the part of the central authorities amounts to an abdication of Government I have already furnished your Excellency with full instructions on the subject of the forcible and unjust intervention of the Ministry of Public W oiks m the dispute which has arisen between the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company and the Societe des Quais: it is matter for grave concern to His Majesty’s Government that, apart from this particular incident, the Board of this Company should be compelled to complain that “for the past two years the attitude of the Ministry of Commerce and Public Works has been increasingly overbearing and harassing,” and that they should have claimed the active protection of His Majesty s Government not only on account of the important material interests involved in the piesent case, but also m view of the systematic and continuous attempts which aie now being made to encroach on the Company’s rights and privileges as laid down in its Conventions with the Imperial Ottoman Government.” I pass now to the incidents of political aggression. On the 30th May, 1909, I informed your Excellency that the Turks had some time previously occupied the island of Zakhnuniyeh, which lies some 10 miles south-east of Ujair; that they had hoisted the Turkish flag on a fort, and had arranged to keep a guard there ; that the Sheikh of Bahrein had protested to His Majesty’s Government against this occupation, his father having built the fort, where he used to keep a garrison, fifty years ago ; and that the island, which had no permanent inhabitants, had been regularly visited for purposes of fishing, by natives of Bahrein. I do not propose to enter upon a detailed review of British relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs, since the matter is one which in no wise concerns the Ottoman Government: I need simply observe that those relations have been the foundation of the maritime peace which has now been maintained in the Persian Gulf for well-nigh a century. Moreover, as your Excellency is aware, in November and December 1871 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs himself gave assurances that his Government had no intention of attacking or obtaining any supremacy over Bahrein or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, and similar assurances had alreadv repeatedly been given to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. But apart altogether from the assurances of the Ottoman Government to which I have referred, Ujair, in the district of El Katif, is the most southerly point which His Majesty’s Government have ever recognised as being under Turkish influence on the coast of the Persian Gulf. In these circumstances your Excellency was instructed to request the Ottoman Government to withdraw the garrison from Zakhnuniyeh on the ground of terminating a disturbance of the status quo ; and your representations were to be based not only on the title of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the island, but also on the fact that it is situated some distance to the south-east of Ujair, the furthest limit of Ottoman jurisdiction. Although the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs informed your Excellency that the garrison had been withdrawn in June 1909, it has since been reinstated in the island, and, according to the latest reports, has quite recently been reinforced : and the Ottoman authorities in regard to this question seem set upon disregarding your Excellency’s repeated representations on the subject. I have accordingly to instruct your Excellency to request that orders may be issued for the immediate and permanent withdrawal of the garrison. The next point upon which I desire to address your Excellency is the treatmento O to whicli the Sheikh of Koweit has been subjected by Suleiman Nazif Bey, the late Vali of Bussorah, with regard to the property which he purchased, in the course of last year, from Ahmed Pasha-el-Zoheir at a price of £ T. 48,000 which was duly paid down. When, however, Sheikh Mubarek took steps to register the transfer at the Turkish Land Office he was informed that he must register himself as a Turkish subject: such a demand in reference to a transfer of land had never before been made. Your Excellency should inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government regard the conduct of the late A ah in this matter as an attempt to modify the status quo with regard to Koweit, which is the basis of the understanding between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government in this important question. It appears, moreover, from reliable and circumstantial reports, that the late Vali tried by tortuous methods to instigate the vendor of the Fedaghia property to impugn Sheikh Mubarek’s title. The vendor remonstrated with the Yali, pointing out the absurdity of repudiating the sale in the face of the title-deeds held by the Sheikh, which, besides the signature of the vendor, bore those of all the Bussorah notables as well as that of the British consul. His Majesty’s Government rely upon the Ottoman Government to bring about a satisfactory settlement of the registration of this property; they have no wish to raise difficulties with regard to the past conduct of an official who has since been recalled ; but I must add that the incident is vexatious, and serves to deepen the impression entertained by His Majesty’s Government of ill-will on the part of the Turkish officials. In his recent dealings with the Sheikh of Mohammerah the conduct of the late Vali of Bussorah has been in the highest degree violent, vindictive, and unjust. It is known to His Majesty’s Government from reports received from His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah that there were no disturbances of importance on the Shat-el-Arab during last winter, that the Sheikh recently exercised his good offices in the endeavour to promote a reconciliation between the Vali and an important Arab chief of Turkish nationality, and that the Sheikh has, in fact, carried his conciliatory attitude towards Nazif Bey so far as to acquiesce without complaint in the destruction of houses belonging to him at Bussorah. It is further known through His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah that Sheikh Khazal has endeavoured to promote friendly relations between Nazif Bey and the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh. Such was the situation at the end of March last when the Sheikh and the Vali appeared still to be on the best of terms. Shortly afterwards, however, the Vali brought against the Sheikh certain accusations into the nature of which it is unnecessary to enter in detail, since your Excellency is already familiar with it from the correspondence which has passed on the subject. No serious proof of the truth of these accusations was ever offered, nor was any opportunity ever given to the Sheikh to disprove the charges brought against him, which he was perfectly able and willing to do. On the contrary, the Vali totally ignored a friendly and conciliatory letter addressed to him by the Sheikh, expressing the intention of proceeding to Bussorah to discuss the matters in dispute, and, further, on the Sheikh’s arrival there on the 18th April, most unjustifiably and discourteously refused to receive Tll TYl citi fl.11 The Sheikh had no alternative but to return to Mohammerah. On the 24th April the Vali issued circular instructions to the local officials under his jurisdiction summarily to remove all headmen dependent on the Sheikh, and on the ^25th April, during the latter’s absence at Ahwaz, the Turkish gun-boat Marmaris, acting on the orders of Nazif Bey, shelled the village of Zain belonging to the Sheikh, which was afterwards looted and destroyed by Turkish soldiers. In the course of this attack the house of the Sheikh’s mother was burnt, and one of his wives died from shock caused by the bombardment. i • n On the 26th April the Vali, in two official letters addressed to the Persian Lonsul at Bussorah, went so far as to threaten action against Mohammerah itself in the event of failure to comply with his demands. . In spite of the injury and provocation which he had leceived, Sheikli Ivhazal continued to be guided by the advice of His Majesty s Government by maintaining a conciliatory attitude, by restraining his agents and supporters fiom any aggressive action, and by adopting their suggestions with respect to the wording of his communications with the Vali. The latter, on the contiary, displayed strong resentment at the attempts made by His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah, under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, to promote an undeistanding between him and the Sheikh.i 4 Nazif Bey, it is true, finally 'accepted Sheikh. Khazal’s explanations and agreed to consider the incident closed, hut he unconditionally refused to^ express regret for the death of the Sheikh’s wife and the destruction of his mother s house, or to pay any compensation for the losses suffered by the Sheikh in consequence of the unjustifiable bombardment of Zain. Further, at the very moment when he was M considering the Sheikh’s explanations with which he owned himself satisfied, his agents were occupied m subjecting the Sheikh to further petty annoyances in the matter of the renewal, contrary to the Vali s promise, of the lawsuit against the servant of Marza Hamza, the Sheikh s agent at Bussorah, of the unjustified destruction, for the third time since the dispute between the Sheikh and the Vali began, of the former’s house property on the Ashar Creek and of the raid on iVlirza Hamza s house and the seizure of his property, on the ground that he had disregarded a summons for debt which had been issued against him. There can be little doubt that Hazif Bey was the real instigator of these vexatious proceedings. A further injustice to the Sheikh has now been committed by the decree recently issued by the Sublime Porte forbidding the registration of land in the vilayet of Bussorah in the name of the Sheikh or his representatives, a measure which appears to be actually contrary to Ottoman law. Your Excellency should bring these facts to the notice of the Turkish Government, and inform them that His Majesty’s Government are bound, by agreement with the Sheikh, to use their good offices on his behalf in the event of a dispute with a foreign Power,’ that they have most carefully considered the circumstances of his recent dispute with the Vali of Bussorah, and cau see no justification whatever for the &lt; harsh and aggressive action of the latter, especially in the matter of the attack^ on Zain, nor for the recent decree of the Porte regarding the registration of land in the vilayet of Bussorah. You should add that, in view of their obligations towards the Sheikli, they cannot allow the status quo on the Shat-el-Arab to be altered to his detriment, and you should express the hope that a satisfactory arrangement will be arrived at with the Sheikh, who has displayed anxiety to live on good terms with his neighbours, and has shown, throughout recent events, great self-restraint and patience, in marked contrast—as His Majesty’s Government observe with regret—with the attitude of the Turkish authorities. These occurrences, which individually have been the cause of painful surprise to His Majesty’s Government, have produced, in their cumulative effect, an unfavourable impression as to the present attitude of the local Ottoman authorities,—an attitude which appears to be one of hostility and aggression. His Majesty’s Government cannot believe that this attitude has the approval of the Central Government, or is based upon their specific instructions. I therefore have decided to instruct you to communicate a translation of this despatch to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in order that his Excellency may be fully apprised of the views of His Majesty’s Government and of their causes of complaint: in taking this step your Excellency should explain that His Majesty’s Government have decided to make friendly representations, believing that the Ottoman Government will redress the grievances referred to, for a situation of very considerable gravity would of course arise if they proved to be the result of deliberate and unfriendly policy. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. oSir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received August 29.) ^ Therapia, August 22, 1910. ON the 5th July I-received a telegram from His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah to the effect that, according to information from the resident at Bushire, Turkish soldiers had again returned to the island of Zakhnuniyeh and that the Turkish flag was hoisted therein Fridays, and later received the despatch from Mr. Crow, copy of which is enclosed herewith. _ , . • I immediately brought the matter to the notice of the Minister for r oreign Artairs and renewed my representations of the spring of last year on the lines of the instructions conveyed in your telegram of the 30th May, 1909, pointing out that the island is situated some 10 miles to the south-east of Ojair, the point recognised by His Majesty’s Government as the furthest, limit of Ottoman jurisdiction in LI Hassa, and that this violation of the status quo would only needlessly create a fresh incident. His Excellency promised to study the question and let me know the result later on, but from the evasive nature of his replies to my repeated representations of last summer I have some doubt about obtaining a definite settlement as desired by His Majesty s Government, and suspect that the withdrawal of the military post, reported by me on the 27th September, 1909, was merely owing to the termination of the fishing season, durino- which the Turks pretended the presence of their gendarmes to be necessary to maintain order among the Dowasir fishermen from Bahrein who frequent the ismnd. In a report received by the Porte from the Mutessarif of El Hassa the latter, after giving the dimensions, &amp;c., of Zakhnuniyeh, maintained that it was practically part ol the mainland, thus revealing the pretensions of the Turks not only to the island but to the coast south-east of Ojair. , ^ ^ Mr. Crow, in his telegram of the 6th August, 1910, reported that the van o± Bussorah has now appointed a mudir, or sub-governor, at Odeid. All this seems to point to a determination to assert and extend Ottoman sovereignty m the neighbour hood of El Katr and it seems to me only prudent that His Majesty s Government should make up its mind as to the attitude to be adopted towards T oimg ^ ur my s general forward policy in the regions of the_ Gulf. Under the old regime we temporised, but it seems that now a more definite and direct attitude may ^ecom expedient, if not necessary. The vigorous action of the Vah of Bussorah m dealing with the Sheikh of Mohammerah and in the bombardment of Zein showed a deter mination to assert Turkish sovereign rights ; while Mr. Lonmer, m ^ telegram of the 16th August, records his conviction that the high-handed methods employed _ by the authorities of Bagdad in the matter of the demolition of Messrs, ^nch s P~s and the threatened encroachments on the residency were intended ^ de ^ foreign subjects and interests are at their mercy. This policy, if not checked, may be extended to the sepoy guard of the residency and to the “ ^ of which is highly distasteful to Turkish national sentiment, whilst it is not imposs that we may Eventually find a boycott, as in the case of the started against Lynch’s steamers with the object of driving ns p icallV its foreign flag off Turkish internal waters. The old regime was economically o fashioned and negative as regards the assertion of its sovereign ri gms. After the change in July 1908, and while the Cabinet was composed of the Elder Liberal statesmen who had preserved the traditions o e . . i q enions t r ations Pashas of the time of the Crimean war and alter, we a pi Turkov under reflecting the views of the^ men in power, and it was e a g - D0S t^ 0n a t their guidance, would shrink from raising awkward ques ions eminent Koweit, Bagdad, Cyprus, Egypt, &amp;c. But it was noticed committeemen took no part in these demonstrations, an seeme r f fAvernment the them, and when in 1909 the committee took over the machinery of Elder Liberal statesmen and pro-British demonstrators were pu present rulers and their voices and sentiments silenced by the state of siege ^ ^ £ younger have to reckon with them to a certain extent. The committee men, is more modern and businesslike, while it is also more po- ^ i [2853 jf —1] imiurrm nimnniirirr-A''9 as regards the vindication of its “ national ” rights. It is not swayed by sentiment but has adopted the doctrine of “ Real-Politik,” and not unnaturally believes that Youno- Turkey has to play a prominent, if not the principal, part in the Asiatic revival and work in sympathy with cognate forces in Persia, Egypt, and India. In its internal form the committee appears to be a Judaso-Turkish dual alliance the Turks supplying a splendid military material and the Jews the brain, enterprise' money {e.g., Djavid Bey’s recent loan in Paris),fand a strong press influence in Europe • while, as shown by Sionist literature since the revolution, the Jewish world seems to have now turned its eyes towards Mesopotamia as the land best suited to Jewish colonisation and the ultimate formation of a Jewish autonomous State. The Jews who now seem to inspire and control the inside machinery of the State, and are bent on the economic and industrial capture of Young Turkey, appear determined that no important enterprise shall be started in Mesopotamia without their participation, if not control and it is perhaps significant that the attacks on Sir William Willcocks have been led by a Jew in a Jewish organ here, and the opposition to the Lynch scheme in Turkish circles was mainly the work of Sassoon Effendi, the Jewish deputy for Bagdad. The Jews, in order to maintain their position of influence in Young Turkey circles, have to play up to, if not encourage, Turkish “nationalist” tendencies, and the two elements make a distinctly strong combination which has to be reckoned with, especially bv those interested in Mesopotamia. It must, moreover, not be forgotten that the present form of constitutionalism in Turkey is not one which the masses have risen up and demanded, but is rather a form which a freethinking oligarchy have imposed on the masses at the point of the bayonet. This minority, who are also in a sense anti-clerical, have felt the necessity of replacing the old theocratic conception of the deeply religious Mussulman by a new Pan-Islamic and Pan-Asiatic creed. Again the purely Turkish element, inspired by its past traditions of conquest and its martial superiority, naturally arrogates to itself the role of protector of other Asiatic and Islamic peoples. The resuit is a strong anti-Russian current, as, in their phraseology, Russia “has usurped and oppresses’^ Asiatic Mussulmans, and a similar, if less strong anti-British current, owing to our position in India, Aden, Egypt, the Persian Gulf, and especially owing to the Anglo-Russian entente regarding Persia and Afghanistan. Thus the natural corollary of this perfervid Asiatic-cum-Islamic sentiment is a community of interest between Russia and England, more particularly in Persia, while France, owing to her position in Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco also, though in a lesser degree, comes in for a share of Young Turkey’s resentment. Had. Turkey’s “ constitutioualism ” been an approximation to real liberal and popular institutions, allowing a certain amount of free play to the different elements, she would, like Austria, have formed internally a natural equipoise of races, and would have felt no necessity to adopt a chauvinistic attitude in her foreign politics—an attitude which is, so to speak, potentially aggressive. The Turkish masses put up with thirty odd years of the despotism of Yildiz, and especially the severer form which obtained during the second half, i.e., since the Armenian massacres, practically without a murmur, and there is no reason wdiy they should nou similarly endure for a considerable period the more go-a-head despotism of the committee. But should the position of the latter be shaken owing to an explosion or internal disaffection or external shock, or a combination of both, we should almost certainly see a repetition of the pro-British demonstrations of 1908, somewhat embar rassing as they were. v ^ however, take facts as they are, and, as far as Mesopotamia is concerned, oung 1 in key s policy is to spare neither energy nor money to create a strong military orce m those regions, to disarm the refractory tribes and bring them under effective contio , and, m a word, to impress the Arabs and show them that the Turk is master against all comers, native or foreign. It must, too, be remembered that the present mi itary Governor-General of Bagdad’s semi-viceregal powers run from Hekkiari in the norm to Mohammerah and. to El Katr in the Arabian peninsula, and the Turks have a natural desire and pretension to pose as the protectors of the weaker Asiatic Mussulman state m Persia. The committee has been compared to a steam-roller, which, in a semi-republican manner, _is determined to level all privileges, starting with those of the palace. It has done so m Albania and Roumelia, and is now busy in Syria. It also, somewhat logically, reels _ a desire to apply the same levelling process to the privileged or predominant position of foreigners, e.g., of the British in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. Had they proceeded slowly and gradually their policy would have been more successful and encountered less objection and resistance. But what appears to natives and forehmers as undue haste and abruptness of method seems to be the prevailing characteristics of3 the new regime, and the recent action of the authorities at Bagdad in the matter of the r arbitrary demolition of Lynch’s premises and their intention of unnecessarily running a v road through the grounds of His Majesty’s consulate-general are only instances in point. One cannot help sympathising with the desire of a regained consciousness of national independence to assert itself, but the present mental attitude of the Young Turks is rather destructive and devoid of a feeling of give and take. Given this frame of mind it would seem only prudent of us not to remind them either in the public press or privately of our commercial or political predominance in Irak or the Gulf, as such assertions only nerve them to further attempts to diminish our prestige and undermine our predominance. The external manifestations of our special position in those regions which wound their susceptibilities are, apart from the general situation in the adjoining districts of South Persia, the size of our residency buildings and grounds at Bagdad, the sepoy guard, the R.I.M.S. “ Comet,” the British flag flown by two of Lynch’s steamers on Turkey’s internal waters, the status of the Sheikh of Koweit, and his influence and position as regards the Mumtefik, Ibn Saoud, &amp;c., Bahrein, and El Katr, if not, indeed, the Trucial Coast and Muscat. The sepoy guard and the “ Comet,” which are the survival of a state of things which is passing away in proportion as Bagdad becomes accessible to ^ the outside world, are in a way incompatible with an effective assertion of Turkey’s territorial sovereignty, and give a certain legitimate ground for umbrage to the Turkish authorities ; but until the new regime is able to stand alone without the prop of martial law in the capital, if not, indeed, until the time comes to do away with the Capitula tions, it would seem premature to consider any suggestion towards abolishing them, except, perhaps, as part of a general bargain or liquidation of our position ms-a-ms of Turkey in the upper reaches of the Persian Gulf. . After the revival of the constitution an attempt was made to settle the^ question ox the British flag on Lynch’s steamers by fusing the latter with the Mehrieh Ottoman Company, and, had Kiamil Pasha or Hilmi Pasha retained power, the scheme would doubtless have been sanctioned; but, as will be remembered, a section of the committee took up an uncompromising attitude, the project fell through, and it only remains for the present to endeavour to protect Lynch’s acquired rights, but the possibiiit} o± friction ending in an anti-Lynch boycott cannot be excluded. . As regards Koweit and Sheikh Mubarek’s sphere of _ influence, His Majesty s Government in 1902 contended that he had always been independent and that ins father had specially stipulated such independence when he allowed Tmdash troops to cross his territory during Midhat Pasha’s expeditions to El Hasa (called Nejd by the Turks) The Turks maintained that Koweit was an integral portion of the Ottoman Empire, and pointed to the Turkish flag flown there, and the grade of pasha accepted bv the sheikh. To this latter argument my predecessor replied that these were mere y emblems of the sheikh’s spiritual dependence on the Caliph, and the status quo^ basis was agreed to, but the Turks interpreted it as meaning that Koweit was an Integra part of their territory. In their mind England’s interference there was due to our rivalry with Germany over the terminal section of and point of the Bagdad Kailuaj and they expect to get the question settled favourably to their contention when final arrangements are made for the completion of that enterprise. As regards Zakhnuniyeh, El Katr, and Bahrein which m a way form one group the active forward policy of the Young Turk Mali of Bussorah and the Mutessanf of El Hasa (Nejd) have already brought us into sharp conflict, and there seems no doubt that we should insist on Turkish exclusion from the district south of If ^ Minister for Foreign Affairs, after studying the question of Za^ in the beginning of the sixteenth century “^n-^emnl &amp;e Kab annexed Gwadur, in South Baluchistan, and sai e up ue , ’ ' , They chiefs to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Ottoman Sultan &lt; , p • W further feel that as the dominant Islamic power they have ^e fi ned h&gt;“ * ^ - under their allegiance and to protect the small Arab Moslem tribes, Ac., Penl Thh second claim is of course untenable from an international point o^iew and is a strange derogation from the much-vaunted principle of Ottomamsm, !opposed to Islamism, supposed to be tbe keystone of tbe new regime. Tbe first claim is barred by the absence of effective occupation for close on three centuries, and is- ^ consequently inadmissible, as shown by the arrangements_ with Germany by which His Majesty’s Government acknowledged the latter’s rights in the Cameroons, South- West Africa, &amp;c. Should the present Turkish Government prove obdurate m the matters of Zakhnuniyeh and the Mudir of Odeid, it would be well, I think, to remember that in applyino- the methods of coercion, employed under the old regime, it was a question of bringing pressure to bear on a Sultan who did not allow such incidents to be discussed in the native press ; whereas the present rulers, who owing to youthful, inexperience have perhaps less sense of caution and responsibility, may, through the native press—which is not allowed to criticise their acts—rouse public opinion by appeals to the fanaticism and ultra-national feelings of the ignorant masses, and by depicting England as aggressively hostile to Islam. I do not, however, think that we should be deterred by such methods. Young Turkey is now on fairly friendly terms with Austria, despite the amputation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while, though the Russian Embassy have been extremely complacent and apparently m relations of most intimate friendship with the leading members of the committee, the latter’s organs have not refrained from fierce attacks on Russia and hei policy. Again, dm mg the last nine months the blandishments showered by the french Embassy and Government on the Young Turks have not deterred them fiom taking up a line of sharp antagonism to French semi-official finance m the matter of a lecent loan, and courting the displeasure of French Government circles by lathei 'violent criticisms m tliG ** Tanm 55 &amp;c. On p. 22 of the Confidential memorandum of February 1908, respecting British interests in the Persian Gulf, the Trucial Coast is said to extend to El Odeid, and the Abu Dthabi are reckoned among the Trucial chiefs, while on p.^ 42 Colonel Pelly is quoted as having in 1872 regarded El Odeid as properly belonging to Aber Dthabi.. In 1904, after the appointment by the Turks of a mudir at Wakra had been cancelled, the Government of India expressed forcibly their view that a treat}' should be negotiated with Sheikh Ahmed, but this course was deprecated by my predecessor, Sir N. R. O’Conor, who regarded the conclusion of the proposed treaty as then inopportune. Should His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India now decide on the expediency of making such a treaty, there would seem to me no objection from the Constantinople point of view, and the time may not be far distant when, as advocated by Lord Lansdowne in February 1905, a comprehensive, as opposed to piecemeal, treatment of outstanding questions in the Persian Gulf, including the withdrawal, absolute or against some quid 'pro quo, of the Turkish post at El Bidaia, may become imperative, if, indeed, it is not forced upon us. In their despatch of the 21st February, 1907, the Government of India expressed the view that the chances of Turkey re-establishing her authority in Eastern Arabia to be remote, and even contemplated the prospect of the Turks disappearing altogether from the whole of Arabia south of Zobehr. The revival of the Turkish constitution in 1908 and the events of the last two years have considerably, if not profoundly, modified the situation in the near East. The Turkish revolution was not merely a change of regime and reign, as it appeared to some, but meant the awakening of new and powerful forces on the lines of an Asiatic or Turkish revival. In 1903 our position in the Gulf seemed threatened by Russia, and Lord Lansdowne’s declaration in the House of Lords had in view the possible aggressive expansion of other Powers than Turkey ; but the latter is now bent on an active and forward policy there, and after the recent acquisition of money in Paris and additions to her fleet from Germany, we may soon see one or more Turkish naval units cruising in the Gulf. A ship flying the Turkish flag will certainly produce a greater effect on the Arabs than did the “ Variag,” 'while the meddlesome tactlessness of Turkish naval officers and their desire to have coaling stations, &amp;c., may give rise to troublesome incidents. I was recently confidentially informed of the drift of a report on the Persian Gulf and England’s position there compiled by Mahmoud Bey, the Ottoman consul-general at Bombay, and his subordinate Jelal Bey, both of whom seem to be keen and active officials. The report sketches the way in which Great Britain has built up her influence by generous pecuniary treatment of the Arab chiefs at Muscat and elsewhere, and urges that the Ottoman Government should employ similar methods, 'which, it says, ought to be more successful than those of England, owing to the Islamic tie between the Arabs and the Turks. Some remarks in this despatch may sound like severe criticism of the policy of the present rulers of Turkey, and I may perhaps point out that my official and 'private.relations with those in power are quite cordial, while their professions of friendship for Great Britain are frequent and, I have no doubt, genuine ; hut I feel that this should C not blind us to the main trend of Young Turkey aspirations, and to the likelihood that the prosecution of their national programme will bring British and Ottoman real or fancied interests into conflict in several parts of the Arab world, and perhaps, especially, in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. Hussein Jahid Bey, deputy for Constantinople, the “ fidus Achates ” of Djavid Bey, the Minister of Finance, and the spokesman of the committee in the “Tanin,” has recently told us in a couple of signed articles that Young Turkey must strain every nerve to increase her land and naval forces, and that when the Minister of War can dispose of 1,500,000 bayonets, and the Minister of Marine of a considerable naval force, Turkey’s Minister for Foreign Affairs will be considered as one of the greatest of European statesmen, and Turkey will then “ wreak vengeance on those who do not now treat her with proper regard.” Some officers in high positions have been heard indulging in similar outbursts, and an aide-de-camp of the Minister of War recently declared to an Englishman here that Turkey would, if put to it, light the Islamic torch from Calcutta to Morocco. These and other such expressions of a crescentade spirit need not be taken too literally, but they cannot be entirely ignored, as they are indicative of strong undercurrents. In this connection, I have the honour to enclose copies of three articles which have recently appeared in the “ Jeune Turc,” a committee-inspired paper, which, like the “ Neue Freie Presse ” of Vienna, is financed and directed by Jews. The latter’s detes tation of Russia, which is one of the features of Young Turkey, is frequently reflected in its columns, and in one of the enclosed articles A. A. (i.e., Ahmed Agaief, a Mussulman from the Crimea) represents English statesmen as having of recent years adopted a policy inconsistent with British traditions by concluding pertain ententes alluding to the Anglo-Russian entente. The articles inveigh against what they erroneously call the Triple Entente, and try to make Young Turkey incline towards the Triple Alliance. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. i! Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

Without questioning the advantage of the new Postal arrangement I would venture to submit to Your Lordship's consideration that it would be advisable under the existing conditions to delay sending an official to assume control of the Post Office until we see, probably in a few months time the result of my representations respecting the Military Post on Bubian Island.I presume that, should my representations meet with no result.

The question of the Sheikh of Koweit's claim to sovereignty over Urn Kasr is so closely connected with his claim to Buhian Island, that it may not he out of place to call attention to two statements in con nection with that place which occur in Captain tU Smyth's report upon the Adana-Persian Gulf Railway, which was submitted to Your Lordship s dep^- c-..en hy the Intelligence Department of the War Office in their letter of the 6th ultimo.

Confidential. 1900. KOWEIT. Historical .—Koweit (or Grane) is a large town of some 20,000 to 25,000 inhabitants (one authority, M. Stavrides, puts the population at 50,000), situated on tbe north-west shore of one of the best harbours in the Persian Gulf. It has for long been regarded as the possible terminus of a projected Euphrates Valley Railway. When in 1871 a Turkish force was sent to the assistance of Abdullah bin Feysul, Amir of Vejd, against his brother—an expedition -which was under taken in spite of representations by Her Majesty’s Government, and which resulted in the establishment of Turkish suzerainty in El Hasa and Katif— the .Koweit Sheikh was an active ally of the Turks, who subsequently, according to Colonel Telly’s report, established a custom house at Koweit. The suzerainty of the Sultan over the portion of the littoral of the Persian Gulf north of Ojair (a place opposite the island of Hemam, just south of Office to Sir Katif) has never been formally acknowledged by Her Majesty’s Government. A. Layard, There are indications, however, that the British Government would have been ready to welcome Turkish authority on that part of the coast if 1888 effectually exerted in the interests of order. Tenacious, however, as they have shown themselves of their shadowy rights, the Turks have done nothing towards establishing their authority in any part of the western sea board of the Turkish Gulf; and have confined themselves to the location of small garrisons at Katif, and at El Bidaa (where the British Government has declined to recognise their authority), and to the grant of the titles of Kaimakam and Mutessarif to certain local chiefs. 1896. Attention was prominently drawn to Koweit in 1896 by a memorandum written by M. Stavrides, Legal Adviser to the British Embassy at Constan tinople, who represented that much excitement had been caused in the Sultan’s entourage by a report that Mubarak, a son of the late Sheikh of Koweit, had at the instigation of the British Resident* murdered his brother and usurped the chiefship. M. Stavrides described Koweit as an independent Arab State, but stated that, owing to the possession by the ruling family of landed property near Busrah, the Sultan had usually accorded his sanction to the succession of each Chief to the throne, and granted to him the title of Kaimakam. A visit of H.M.S. “ Sphinx ” to Koweit in July 1896 con firmed the report of Mubarak’s usurpation. Commander Baker reported that Koweit, though nominally independent, was in reality greatly under Turkish influence, more especially since Mubarak s accession, and that the luikish flag was flying there. Jn December 1896 the Consul at Busrah reported that he was satisfied that Koweit subjects were concerned in a piratical attack on the British dhow “Haripasa.” It was at first proposed, and the Indian Government were inclined to favour the proposal, to hold the Turkish and Persian Governments responsible—a proposal which would, in the circumstances, have involved a recognition of Turkish authority over Koweit; but it was eventually decided not to adopt this method of procedure on the ground of the improbability that any satisfaction would be obtained by it. 1897. The Sheikh of Koweit was eventually seriously warned by the Resident that he would be held responsible for the misconduct of his subjects. In February 1897 a proposal was made by the Constantinople Sanitary Board to establish a Turkish quarantine station at Kov/eit. The Government of India had no objection, but nothing appears to have been done to carry out the proposal efiectively, though a so-called sanitary authority is stationed ■tli ere. t Political, 612/96. 805/96.

On the 27th February the Government of India reported that Mubarak was making overtures for an interview with the Resident, and permission was given for the interview to take place. Colonel Meade reported the result of' the interview in his letter of the 25th September 1897. It appeared that tie Sheikh wished to place himself under British protection such as was enjoyed by Bahrein. He had previously endeavoured to secure recognition from the Turks, and it was doubtful whether his advances to us were bond fide or designed to put pressure on the Turks. On the whole, Colonel Meade was in favour of meeting the Sheikh’s wishes, but recognised that difficulties would arise from Turkish claims. In the meantime Captain Whyte, lately Consul at Busrah, had sent in a memorandum showing strong reasons against M. Stavrides’ assertion that Koweit was independent of Turkey. The Foreign Office had accordingly instructed Sir N. O’Conor (with reference to a proposal that the British Consul should intervene in consequence of an attack which had been made on Koweit by Sheikhs Jassim of Katr and Yusuf Ibrahim) that, though we- had never acknowledged Koweit to be under Turkish protection, it seemed doubtful whether we could deny that in fact it was under Turkish influence. The Consul was accordingly instructed not to intervene unless the peace of the Gulf was threatened. This attitude was consistently maintained by Her Majesty’s Government^ notwithstanding rumours that the Turks intended to intervene and that a son of the murdered Sheikh had invoked British assistance and protection, and a representation by the Government of India that, whereas Koweit was at present a dangerous piratical centre and emporium for the slave trade, Sheikh Mubarak was anxious to accept our protection. The receipt of Colonel Meade’s report, and of a letter from the Admiral on the East India Station advocating the strengthening of our hold over Koweit, did not affect the attitude of Her Majesty’s Government, though it was laid dowiy that there was nothing’ in the status of Koweit to hamper naval officers in bringing home to the Sheikh responsibility for piratical acts committed by his subjects (telegram to India, dated 4th December 1897). 1898. Late in 1897 and early in 1898 reports were received of movements of Turkish troops near Busrah, of an alleged Russian mission to Baghdad, and of an intention on the part of Russia to acquire a coaling station on the- Persian Gulf, possibly Koweit. These reports induced the India Office to- ask the Foreign Office (11th February 1898) whether they were in possession of amy information as to designs of Foreign Powers, which might make it desirable to modify the policy of non-intervention in Koweit. To this letter no reply was received till the 5th December 1898. In the interval Mr. (now Lord) Curzon had been inquiring into the subject, but officially the question had been allowed to rest; and nothing had occurred to bring it again into prominence until the receipt of Sir N. O’Conor’s Despatch °e •^'( )vem ^ er 1898, which enclosed a Consular Report to the effect t. H 16 ^ a li °f Busrah, by sanction of the Porte, had appointed a commis sion to settle the quarrels between Sheikh Mubarak and his nephews. The India Office then addressed a letter to the Foreign Office (dated 23rd November 1898) drawing attention to the issues raised in the letter of the llth e ruary. The Foreign Office in reply expressed their readiness to support the oyernment of India by diplomatic action, should that Government consider a a protectorate over Koweit might be asserted and undertaken by it on its so e lesponsibdity without difficulty or inconvenient extension of police duties m e Gulf.

Egypt, or Athe Persian Gulf.] i 1899. About this time came news that Count Kapnist’s application for a concession to build a railway from Tripoli to Koweit was likely to prove successful; and, in order to take precautions against any territorial claims which Russia might possibly base upon that concession, it was decided (without waiting for the reply of the Government of India to the telegram of the 24th December) at the instance of the Foreign Odice (letter 4th January 1899) to instruct the Viceroy to procure an engagement from the Sheikh “ not to cede, lease, mortgage, or otherwise alienate or give for occupation ‘ £ any portion of his territories to the Government or subjects of any other “ Power without previously obtaining the consent of Her Majesty’s Govern- “ ment.’’ The consideration was to be a sum of 5,0007. to be advanced by India, the question of the ultimate incidence of the charge being reserved (telegram to Viceroy, dated 6th January 1899). The Viceroy reported that he had instructed the Resident accordingly (telegram, 9th January 1899); and added “ Proposed negotiations, if successful, seem to involve ultimate protectorate.” After some discussion as to the form of the engagement, the Government of India were finally instructed (telegram, 17th January 1899) to adopt as a model the Muscat Agreement of 20th March 1891, and Colonel Meade was authorised to promise an annual subsidy of Rs. 3,000, if he considered it desirable, instead of a lump sum of 5,000/. as originally proposed. Colonel Meade reported his procedings in his letter of the 30th January 1899 (Enclosure in India Secret Letter, Vo. 7, 23rd February 1899). He met Sheikh Mubarak on the 23rd January, and showed him the draft agree ment,* in which (in excess of the Government of India’s instructions) a clause had been inserted binding the Sheikh not to receive the representatives of Foreign Powers. Before signing a document which might get him into trouble with Turkey, the Sheikh asked for some assurance of British pro tection and assistance, especially in regard to the family property situated in Turkish territory. Colonel Meade promised him a letter assuring him of “the good offices of Her Majesty’s Government” so long as he and his successors observed the conditions of the bond, and promising him a sum of Rs. 15,000. On receipt of this letter, the Sheikh signed the agreement. His brothers, however, refused to sign in the absence of a distinct undertaking that Her Majesty’s Government would protect the family estates. The conclusion of the Agreement was notified in the Viceroy’s telegram of the 30th January, and its terms were communicated in his further telegram of the 12th February. This latter telegram asked (1) whether, with a view to conciliate the Sheikh’s brothers, Colonel Meade should be instructed to give an assurance that their “ interests in regard to the Turkish estates will be looked after and receive consideration of Her Majesty’s Government;” (2) whether the Agreement should be ratified. The Foreign Office (14th February) agreed to Colonel Meade “ holding out a hope that Her Majesty’s “ Government will do what they can to protect the family estates of the Sheikh “ of Koweit at Fao,” and considered that the Agreement should be ratified. This decision was communicated to the Viceroy by telegraph on the 14th February. The Government of India were informed by Despatch of the 30th March 1899 that Colonel Meade’s action was approved; but it was observed that he had not been authorised to insert a proviso about the representatives of other Powers. As this proviso had been introduced, it might remain in force; but its operation, especially with reference to the Sheikh’s relations with the Turkish Government, would require careful attention. Meanwhile, on the 3rd February, the Government of India, having learned that there was a possibility of armed interference by the Turks, asked for permission to instruct the naval authorities to forbid it. This was granted; and the Admiral reported that, if time were given to collect ships, Koweit Kapnist concession. Political, 1G57 !)'). 151/99. 155/99. 31999.

(Political, 2292/99.) would be defensible by the Navy alone. Arrangements were made that Her Majesty’s Government should have the earliest possible notice, in the event of preparatory measures being found necessary, in order to give a serious warning to Turkey before forcible measures were actually taken. It was also decided, contrary to the view of the Government of India, that the Admiral should take no steps to prevent Turkish transports leaving the Shat-ul-Arab without orders from the Admiralty, which would only be issued when the occasion arose. During the month of February further reports were received of visits of Russians to Koweit. Consular reports from Busrah also made it clear that the suspicions of the Turks had been excited by Colonel Meade’s visit. A formal complaint was made by the Constantinople Board of Health that Colonel Meade had landed by force in defiance of sanitary regulations* the Nakib of Busrah proceeded to Koweit ostensibly on private business* Mubarak was reported to be distrusted ; and it appeared probable that the Vali of Busrah, might espouse the cause of Mubarak's nephews. Sir N. O’Conor considered that it might be desirable to warn the Porte that Her Majesty’s Government would view with displeasure any expedition against Mubarak* but further reports induced him to modify his opinion (No. 292, dated 6th June), and it was decided merely to authorise the Consul at Busrah to warn the Vaii (to Sir JS 1 . O’Conor, dated 17th June), and to enjoin on the Sheikh of Koweit caution in his language (telegram to Viceroy, dated 20th June 1899). Meanwhile the Government of India (No. 101, dated 1st June) had supported a suggestion of Colonel Meade, that diplomatic action should be taken with a^ view to an early understanding with the Porte in respect to the status of Koweit, in order to prevent local complications. Colonel Meade’s letter of the 14th May (Enclosure 5) reported an allegation that the Turks were inciting other Arab Sheikhs, especially the Sheikh of Nejd, to attack Koweit, so as to give them an excuse for interference. Further reports received from the Consul at Busrah induced Sir N. G Conor (No. 328, dated 5th July 1899) to think it possible that the Sultan might himself broach the subject of Koweit; and he suggested, that in that case, while avoiding as far as possible a definite statement respecting the inaependence of Koweit, he might say that it would be a satisfactory arrangement for both England and Turkey if the Sultan would agree not to cede any of his rights in those parts to other Powers. This proposal was approved, subject to a limitation proposed by the India Office (18th July 1899) that nothing should be said which might hamper us in giving effect to our obligations under the Koweit Agreement (to Sir N. O’Conor, dated 25th July 1899). Before, however, this permission could be acted upon, reports were received from the Consul at Busrah, that the Turks had appointed a harbour master to Koweit; that the Sheikh had declined to receive him ; that a renewed attempt to appoint a native of Koweit as harbour master had been oidered iioin Constantinople; and that the Turkish military authorities weie advocating strong measures. It was also rumoured that the Turks proposed to establish a custom house at Koweit. The India Office (7th September 1899)^ in view of the embarrassment which might be caused by acquiescence in such an exercise of the rights of sovereignty by the Porte recommended to the Foreign Office that the Turkish Government should ; informed that Her Majesty’s Government had entered into engagements with the Sheikh of Koweit as an independent ruler, and were not disposed : to lecognise any infringement of his independence; or, at least, that it should be intimated that the authority of no Turkish official at Koweit would be recognised. The Foreign Office thereupon instructed Sir N. O’Conor to wain the Porte at once that, while Her Majesty’s Government had them selves no designs on Koweit, they had friendly relations with the Sheikh ; and that a very inconvenient and disagreeable question would be raised if an attempt were made to establish Turkish authority or customs control at Koweit witnout previous agreement with Her Majesty’s Government. At the same time they requested the Admiralty to send a ship to Koweit to protect the b eikn against overt acts of aggression by the Turkish authorities ; but, on leceipt or a telegram from Sir N. O’Conor representing the inexpediency ofthis latter step in the existing circumstances, H.M.S. “ Sphinx ” was ordered merely to call at Koweit and proceed without making any stay. In his Despatch ISTo. 440 of the 13th September 1899, Sir IST. O’Conor reported that he had carried out his instructions, and had received an assurance from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that no further attempt would be made to insist upon the appointment of the harbour master; that Admiralty to Foreign Office, dated 14th Sept. 1899. Political, 2299/99. the Ottoman Government had no intention of establishing a custom house at Koweit; and that the despatch of a military expedition was not in contem plation, as, though such an expedition had been proposed by the Yali, the Sultan did not consider it worth the risk or expense. In a Despatch written on the following day Sir K. O’Connor reported that it had been represented to him by Anthopoulo Pasha that the &gt;ultan was much disturbed by his (Sir JNf. 0.Conor’s language with regard to Koweit, which appeared to indicate a desire on the part of Her Majesty’s Government to interfere with His Majesty’s liberty of action in Turkish territory. Sir K. O’Conor replied that it would be better to leave no door open for mis understanding, and he repeated his language of the previous day, emphasising the points that Her Majesty’s Government had no aggressive intentions in those parts, and that it depended on the Ottoman Government not to raise an intricate and unpleasant question without necessity. He added that Her Majesty’s Government were in most friendly relations with the Sheikh of Koweit and could not pass without notice any hostile action taken against him ; but he avoided the direct issue of the territorial dependency of the Sheikh. In a further Despatch Sir N. 0’Conor reported that he had had a further conversation with Tewtik Pasha, in which he again impressed upon the Foreign Minister the desirability of not now raising a question about Koweit, reminding him that in 1883 Lord Granville had informed Rustem Pasha that the Turkish right of sovereignty over the El Katar Coast had never been admitted by Her Majesty’s Government. Tewfik Pasha agreed in considering it inexpedient to raise this awkward question. The language held by Sir N. O’Conor was approved by Her Majesty’s Government. 2332-3/99.

O’Conor 2332 / 99 . reported the steps taken by the Consul at Busrah in fulfilment of the promise that Her Majesty’s Government would do what they could to protect the estates of the Koweit chiefs at Fao. Mr. Wratislaw had on the 26th July, in accordance with instructions conveyed to him by Sir IST. O’Conor in July, expressed to the Yali a hope that an equitable settlement would scon be ( 2l04 / 99 -) arrived at of the rival claims of Sheikh Mubarak and of the sons of the late Sheikh, it being a matter in regard to which Her Majesty’s Government were not indifferent. From the conversation which followed, it appeared that Mubarak had made totally inadequate proposals; and the Consul was of opinion that he had been treated by the Porte with “ surprising tenderness,” considering that 1m had declined to submit to the jurisdiction of the Turkish Courts, within which the estates in question undoubtedly lie, and had for three years appropriated the whole of the revenues. The Consul, notwith standing his instructions (see telegram to Sir N. 0’Conor, dated 17th June), had not thought inopportune on this occasion to warn the Yali against taking- hostile action against Mubarak till indications of the necessity of such a warning, which were not then apparent, should present themselves. The 2297/99. warning was subsequently delivered to the Yali on the 8th September 1899. 9 . qo/ Ender the date of the 5th October (No. 474) Sir N.

This result appears, from Consul Wratislavv’s Despatch, above referred to (No. 46), to have been connected with a new development in the Kuweit situation which was first reported by Sir N. O'Conor in his telegram of the 5th January 1900, viz., that a Commission (including the German Consul- General at Constantinople and the Chief Engineer of the Anatolian Railway) in connection with the German scheme for a railway to Bagdad, which had just arrived at Busrah, intended to try for a concession of a port at Koweit and that it would start for Koweit in a few days with this view. In a subsequent telegram* from Sir N. O’Conor it was reported that the German promoters appeared to intend to negotiate direct with the Porte, mnomia* the Sheikh. A further report, however, was received through the Viceroy from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, who visited Koweit on th*e 13th January, to the effect that the Germans proposed to acquire three or four miles of land at Kathama Bay; that the Sheikh had been asked by Mohsin Pasha to befriend the German mission; and that Captain Denison had delivered to Sheikh Mubarak a message from the Resident, Persian Gulf (sent with the Viceroy’s permission!) to the effect that the Sheikh must inform him (the Resident) of any proposals made to him by the (Hermans and abide by the decision of the Government of India in the matter. To this message Mubarak had replied on the 21st January stating that he was under our protection and would do all that we desired. The Sheikh’s account of his interview with the Commission, which took place on the 20th January, is given in Mr. Gaskin’s report of the 5th February. The Commission had stated that they held a concession from the Sultan, who was largely interested in the undertaking, to make a railway in Turkish territory, and that they desired to extend it to Kathama Bay, which they wished to buy, obtaining certain other lands on lease ; that their present visit was only preliminary in order to secure Mubarak’s co-operation and support with the Arab Sheikhs through whose territory the line would pass; that he would be handsomely paid for any land purchased or leased from him \ that the trade and importance of Koweit would be greatly enhanced and that he would ^joy protection of the German Government. Mubarak represented himself as having declared that he was territorially independent of the Sultan ; that the Arabs would not consent to alienate their land, and that he could not help the Germans with the Arab Chiefs. He said that the Com mission finally offered him presents, which he refused, and went away the same day promising further communications from the German Ambassador at Constantinople. The Germans, on the other hand, wrote to their friends at Busrah stating that they were well received by the Sheikh and would certainly take their line to Koweit. Meanwhile, on the 19th January, the Foreign Office had asked for Sir N. O Conor s opinion as to whether it would be preferable to warn the Porte against taking any decision in this matter without consulting Her MajestVs Government, or to speak to his German colleague confideatiallv of our relations with Koweit. Si! N. 0 uonorj was of. opinion that the moment was not opportune for aking either of these courses. He suggested as a third course that a hint should be conveyed privately by Sir E. Law to the concessionaires, that any aiiangement which would ignore British relations with Koweit would mmit m delaying the enterprise. This course was sanctioned by the Foreign Office m their telegram No. 27 of the 26th January. Nothing, however, came of it. ' j » On the 2nd March the Admiralty communicated to the Foreign Office an extract from a letter (dated 27th January) from the Senior Naval Officer in tie lersian Gulf, reporting the proceedings of the German Commission, and representing that it would be a great blow to our prestige in the Gulf were any other Power allowed to acquire the port of Koweit. On the 12th March, in view of the visit of the Russian gunboat “ Gilyak,” with the Russian Consul at Bagdad on board, to Koweit, H.M.S. “ Sphinx” v as mtiered to proceed to Koweit and remain there for a few days. The ‘ brought a present from the Russian Consul to the Sheikh.On the 20th March Sir JST. O’Conor was authorised to inform the Turkish Political, Government and the German Ambassador how matters stood between the 18o6 / 190 °- British Government and the Sheikh. In his Despatch No. 130 of the 10th April, Sir N. O’Conor reported a 2027/1900. conversation he had had with Tewfik Pasha on the 9th April regarding the visit of the German Commission to Eoweit, in which he again stated that Her Majesty’s Government would not regard with indifference any action which would alter the existing state of things or give to another Power special rights or privileges in Koweit. Tewfik Pasha evinced no desire to discuss the matter, and Sir Nicholas concluded that the Ottoman Government had already a fairly correct knowledge of our agreement with the Sheikh. On the same day Sir N. O’Conor informed the German Ambassador that Her Majesty’s Government had an agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit, which, while leaving the statics quo unimpaired, prevented the Sheikh from alienating his territories without the consent of the British (government. Baron von Marschall, who betrayed some dissatisfaction at this statement, said that he supposed such an agreement would not prevent the construction of the railway, but that he was quite alive to the disadvantages of alienating British capital. Sir Nicholas replied that he thought there would be no difficulty in reconciling our interests with those of the liailway Company, and referred to negotiations between the Anatolian Bail way and the Euphrates, Tigris and British India Companies. Sir N. O’Conor’s action was approved in Lord Salisbury’s Despatch No. 89, of the 24th April. On the 21st April a report (dated 29th March 1900) was received from the Yice-Consul at Bahrein that the Anatolian Bailway Company was already making preparations for the construction of a pier at Koweit, and this report received some confirmation from a naval report, dated 26th March, to the effect that the Sheikh had stated that the Germans had been surveying. Sir N. O’Conor was not prepared to address the Porte upon these rumours, which he considered improbable, but he suggested the appointment of a British secret agent at Koweit to keep a watch upon the Sheikh and secure his fidelity. The rumours were ultimately reported not to have been confirmed. (Viceroy’s telegram, 7th June.) The reports, however, of German activity were such as to cause special instructions to be proposed for .the guidance of Her Majesty’s ships in the event of collisions between the Germans and the Arabs. 2056/1900. 2123/1900. 2048/1900. 2056/1900. 592/1900. 2123/1900. With regard to the proposal to send a secret agent to Koweit, the India Office were of opinion that, before this step should be taken, it would be advisable to decide what attitude Her Majesty’s Government should adopt in case the Turkish and German Governments combined in pressing for the cession of a site lor the railway terminus at Koweit.. They further suggested that it would be well to explain the position more precisely to the Porte and to consider whether some arrangement might not be arrived at with the German Government, under which the construction of the railway works at Koweit might be permitted, subject to a full reservation of the political position acquired by Her Majesty’s Government under the agreement. The I proposal to send a secret agent was then dropped. At the end of May a proposal was made on behalf of the British India Steam Navigation Company that a weekly service of steamers to Koweit should be arranged. The Poreign Office approved ; and on the 3rd July Mr. Lyle, a re presentative of the Company, proceeded to Koweit, and had an interview with the Sheikh, who agreed to the scheme, provided no quarantine difficulties were involved. However, in the middle of August the Sheikh wrote to Mr. Lyle notifying his withdrawal from the scheme, probably owing to pressure put upon him by Syed Ahmed, an influential member of the family of the Nakib of Busrah. ^ In the meantime a move of importance had been made at Berlin, when o] the 15th June Sir P. Lascelles had mentioned the Koweit question to Coun Bulow (much in the same terms as Sir N. O’Conor had done to Baro; M arse nail but admitting the “technical” supremacy of the Porte), am had requested that Her Majesty’s Government might be furnished with earl information if the idea of the Koweit terminus was to be entertained. Coun India Office to Foreign Office, dated 10th May 1900. (Political 2056/1900.) Sir N. D’Conor, No. 291, dated 1oth Aug. 1900.

Lascelles' action was approved (No. 126, dated 22nd June). On the 18th June Sir N. O’Conor forwarded an extract from the report of the German Commission, which was in favour of the selection of Kathama Bay as a terminus. The report showed the impression left upon the minds of the Commissioners as to the status of the Sheikh. On the one hand, they stated that he had taken such an independent attitude that there could be no question of Ottoman authority in the district. On. the other, they said that Kathama Bay was undoubtedly Turkish territory, and that “it would not be difficult for the Turks to establish their sovereign rights.” They had seen no sign of the Sheikh intending to place himself under the protection of a foreign Power, as had been rumoured.

(that of Mohsin Pasha) at Busrah, Mubarak’s relations with the Turks improved. In June it was reported that he had been created a Pasha and had received a decoration from the Sultan, and the various projects which had been set on foot by Hamdi Pasha for establishing Turkish authority at Koweit, and which were so distasteful to Mubarak, had been dropped. Further, his promised visit to Busrah was not for the time insisted upon. It may he mentioned incidentally that the Resident reported early in May (telegram to India dated 10th May) a probability that certain arms which had been confiscated by the Chief of Bahrein, and which were about to be restored to Messrs. Fracis Times &amp; Co., would be disposed of at Koweit. The Resident was authorised to negotiate an agreement with Sheikh Mubarak to absolutely prohibit all importation and exportation of arms at Koweit. This agreement was readily accepted by the Sheikh on the 24th May, and he issued on the same day notifications to carry it out. Her Majesty’s Government approved of these proceedings on the understanding that without special instructions no effect should be given to the powers granted to British ships by the Sheikh to search vessels in Koweit waters.

Early in October a report was received that raids bad been made on Nejd territory by Sheikh Abdur Rahman bin Faisal, a member of the Sand dynasty of Riadh, which had been ousted in 1886 by its vassal, Mohammed bin Rashid, Sheikh of the Jebel Shammer tribe. Mohammed bin Rashid had established himself as de facto ruler of Nejd, and had been succeeded by his nephew Abdul Aziz bin Rashid in December 1897. On the 8th October 1900 the Viceroy reported that fighting seemed probable in the neighbourhood of Koweit, and proposed to send Colonel Kemball to|Koweit to report and to warn the Sheikh against action likely to cause interference by the Turks. Her Majesty’s Government approved ; and from Colonel Kemball s report (dated 3rd November and received 10th December 1900) it appeared that Mubarak was absent from Koweit when he arrived, and that his son came off to meet Colonel Kemball in a boat flying the Turkish flag. Colonel Kemball was, therefore, unable to deliver the proposed warning, but he gleaned the following information. Abdur Rahman bin Faisal had been for some years (since 1891) living at Koweit under Mubarak’s protection. On the other band Sheikh Abdul Aziz of Nejd had espoused the cause of Mubarak s enemy, Yusuf bin Ibrahim, and of the sons of Mubarak’s murdered brothers. 'When, therefore, Abdur Rahman appealed to Mubarak for assistance, the latter ordered the Bedouin tribes subject to Koweit to support Abdur Rahman in bis raids upon Nejd from the East. Simultaneously Sadun Pasha, a Turkish subject and chief of the Montefik Bedouins, had raided Nejd from the north, whether at Mubarak’s instigation, or not, it was not clear. A Despatch* from Consul Shipley carried the story somewhat further. It appeared that the Emir of Nejd with a large force appeared within two and a half days march of Busrah and demanded satisfaction for Sadun Pasha s raid.^ To this the Vali agreed, and the Emir retired, hut his future intentions with regard to the Koweit raid “were left in doubt. The main facts of Consul Shipley’s report were telegraphed by Mr. de Bunsen on the 1st November, with a recommendation that a gunboat should go to Koweit to watch events^ A previous telegram*]* from Consul Shipley had reported matters at Koweit to be quiet and hostilities suspended ; and a subsequent message (dated 2nd November) from Mr. de Bunsen withdrew his recoin-217) 1900.

On the 9th November, therefore, the India Office recommended to the Eoreign Office that no further action should be taken tor the present; but, a less reassuring account of the state of affairs having been received from the Admiralty on the following day (10th November) the India Office again addressed the Eoreign Office (14th November) suggesting that a British Agent should be sent in a ship of war to ascertain the true state of affairs and to endeavour to warn the Emir of Nejd that no attack on Koweit would be allowed. It was further suggested that should it prove impossible to resist a land attack with the force available at the moment, the Sheikh should be offered a refuge and steps taken as soon as possible to repulse the invaders. Further news was received on the same day that an attack on Koweit by the Emir of Nejd was considered improbable, but possible ; and that the Turks were reinforcing their garrison at Basrah. The -foreign Office agreed to the despatch of a gunboat, but added that no active measures should be taken without further reference to Her Majesty's vrovernment. The Government of India were then instructed accordinMv and it was suggested that Colonel Kemball should again proceed to Koweit’ On the loth November a telegram (dated 14th November) from Consul ohipley was forwarded by Mr. de Bunsen reporting that Mubarak's forces had joined those of Sadun Pasha, and that the Turks were sendum a force to intervene and compel the combatants to return home. On the 16th November, the Admiral reported that he had taken steps to 2538/1900 strengthen the naval force available in the neighbourhood of Koweit. On the same day (in a telegram received from Constantinople, 17th) Consul Shipley reported that the crisis was over, both forces being on their oi:tQ ,, nnn way home; and that Mubarak was to meet the Yali about 30 miles from 5 ; 9 °‘ Busrah on the following day, this being regarded as his promised visit. On the 19th November, Consul Shipley reported that Mubarak had returned to Busrah with the Yali, and that they had both been eimao'ed for several hours communicating with Constantinople by tele g r aph. A Report subsequently received (dated 13th November) showed that Mubarak was contmuing his endeavours to ingratiate himself with the Porte, and was meeting with some success. • ° rl t f' e , (Yl! November), the Viceroy reported that lie had 1256 / 1900 . instructed Colonel Kemball to go to Koweit and, if still necessary, to convey a warning to the Emir of Nejd. ' J On the 26th November, the Yiceroy further reported that Colonel Kemball deprecated a visit to Koweit at present on the ground that it would probably encourage Mubarak to take further action against the Emir, who had real giievances against him. The Yiceroy concurred; and, the same view bein 0, taken by Her Majesty’s Government, instructions w^ere sent that the visit should be postponed for the present. In this connection it should be mentioned that on the 13th October last the French Consul at Bagdad, M. Bouet, proceeded to Koweit in the French Government vessel “Drome,” returning via Fao. The visit appears to have been arranged suddenly after an interview with the Yali, but the object of it has not as yet transpired. Here the matter stands at the present moment. The position of the Turks has been much improved in Koweit since Mohsin Pasha’s appointment as Yali, and it is clear that it was Turkish influence which averted the recent crisis. Moreover, by his recent visit to Busrah, Mubarak has to some extent recognised Turkish suzerainty, and is further stated (Consul Wratislaw’s No. 44, dated 22nd November 1900) to have given the Sultan an assurance of his fidelity, and to have promised to cease “ coquetting with foreign Powers.” S. 36.

It may be added that, a question having arisen out of the seizure of arms on the “ Hathor,” the shipper of which was said to be a merchant of Koweit it was decided by Her Majesty’s Government that, “ as Koweit is not under “ formal British protection, natives of that country cannot be claimed as “ British protected persons or be justiciable to British Consular tribunals in “ Persia.” C.

P.S .—The question of financial liability for the arrangement with Koweit has not been discussed in this paper. It may, however, be convenient to record that on the 18th January 1899 the Foreign Office addressed a letter to this Office, in which they stated that the non-alienation agreement with the Sheikh which they had proposed in their letter of 4th January 1899 should be considered separately from the question of a British Protectorate, in regard to which they had stated, in their letter of the 5th December 1898, that action must depend on the power of the Indian Government to afford material support for the maintenance of the Protectorate. They regarded their proposal for a non-alienation engagement as falling short of a proposal for a Protectorate engagement; and they did not contemplate, in asking the assistance of the Indian Government towards obtaining the former engagement from the Sheikh, that that Government “ would in the slightest “ degree pledge themselves to take any action, or to accept any liability, “ under any circumstances that might arise in the future.” The local authorities rather exceeded their instructions, and an extended agreement and not merely a non-alienation agreement was concluded. It was however, ratified by the Viceroy with the sanction of the Foreign Office, conveyed in their letter of the 14th February 1899. Bs. 15,000 were paid on ratification to the Sheikh, of which the Foreign Office repaid 500Z. to Indian revenues. The question of liabilities, if any are incurred hereafter, in respect to the agreement finally concluded will depend upon the letter of the 18th February 1899 mentioned above.Translation of Arabic Bond.
