Subjects Dues of ^r. Abdur Rahman Khan, ex. Administrator CrVfadur, Oman State. 0 With reference to your endost. No. 3-375/50, date* the 28th Sept. 1950, I have the honour to state that on being approached the Accountant General Pakistan Revenues, Karachi, has informed that they have received intimation about the adjustment of Rs. 835/11/- (Rs. Sight hundred thirty five -/ll/-) and R's. 1129/1/- (Rs. One thousand one hundred twenty nine -/l/-) vide letter No. AC.290-1-62/SHH dated November nil, I960, from the High Commissioner of Pakistan in U.K. Ha also informed me that the Kascat Govt, had credited the amounts inquestion in Indian currency. This would mean that when the payment is made to me in Pakistan currency, I will stand to lose about Rs. 600/- without any obvious fault of mine. These amounts are due to me when both the currencies Were at par. The devaluation came much later and if settlement of my dues had been made earlier I would not have lost this large sum. 2 . Un&amp;ar cue above explained circumstances, I feel justified to approach you with the request that Muscat Govt, may be requested at an early date to pay me these amounts either in Pakistan currency or as an alternative credit the amounts with the firm Haji Musa Juma of Muscat who have got a branch in Bela, from where I can receive these amounts provided an Intimation is sent by the above firm to their branch at Bela for payment of these dues to me. . * 3 . In-view of the difficulty already experienced it will not he out of place to point-out here that the A.G.P.R* may be informed to bear the fact in mind when raising necessary debit against the Muscat Govt, on account of my leave and pension contribution.
