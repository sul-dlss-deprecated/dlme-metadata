The service thus provided for traffic between the U.K. and Bahrein in^ both directions, and also between Bahrein and Karachi in both directions. The B.O.A.C. have just represented to us that in the light of experience since the inception of the service, the shuttle between Bahrein and Karachi is^ not only not earning its keep , but the traffic carried has recently been practically negligible. ^ On economic grounds, therefore, there is no justification for its retention, and the Corporation have sought our approval Continued. P. A. K. Harrison Esq. S ul ( .■ MMk to its withdrawal at an early date. The once weekly U.i,./Bahrein service would, of course, continue. As you know, we must take the economic aspect into account in the operation of Air Services, anc 7 ^^ unless there are overridi'ng political considerations requiring the continuance of a hopelessly uneconomic service such as this, we are bound to consider talcing it off. Our original idea, when considering the means by which we could seive Bahrein, was to operate a flying boat service between U.K. and Bahrein only. The addition of the shuttle service between Bahrein and India was somewhat of an after thought, and has no doubt served a useful purpose to the small extent that it has, in fact, been used. In the circumstances, however, we propose to acquiesce in B.O.A.C.'s suggestion for its withdrawal and shall be grateful if you will give forewarning to the political resident of this intention. Y/e have in mind in this connection an earlier complaint by the pol itica l resid e nj; that he sometimes only learnt of changes in B.O.A.C.'s plans and services after the event, and his plea that he should be given reasonable notice of any changes. We will, of course, welcome the views of the political resident on the proposed withdrawal of the Bahreir/Karachi shuttle service and they will certainly be taken into account, but I think it is only fair to say that we may not be able to regard them as finally decisive in face of the economic factors. iU - Yours2n Clair 3 CIVIL ..VI^TION DISTlIHJTIOI, TOQm B.&gt;MGKQK TO FORIIGN QITICC. ivir.

Our Ref;- R, 27771A6/B.O.AU. 8th April, 1%7. r Dear Harrison, Ci 1- . Will you please refer to my letter of the 20th March about the proposed flying boat service to Bahrein. ' In paragraph 3 I stated that the route between Cairo and Bahrein had not yet been definitely decided upon but an intermediate call would be made either at Basra or Abadan. B.O.A.C. have not up to the present made up their minds on this point but they have informed us that for the time being the service, from the date of its introduc tion, will follow the existing route, i,e. calling only at Basra between Cairo and Bahrein. They state, however, that although they are prepared operationally to make a call at Abadan (and thus satisfy the Oil Company’s demands) instead of Basra, they are not sure of the political implica tions. In this connection, I should perhaps mention that we have not yet passed on to B.O.A.C. the remarks made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in his telegram No. 339 dated 28th March. This may, of course, turn the scales F.A.K. Harrison, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.lin favour of Basra as the permanent intermediate call instead of Abadan, but we should be grateful for your advice as to yhether there would likely to be any political implications in scheduling the call at Abadan before we discuss the matter further with B.O.A.C.

Yours faithfully,Lt. Gol. W.R. Hay CSI, OIS, Political Reside t for the Persian Gulf, the Residency, Bahrein, heard that I was comi and met me at Kuwait. I also met Major M.P&lt;&gt; O’Go inor Ta dy, Political A^ent, Kuwait. BOaC have withdrawn their flying boat service up the Persian Gulf in spite of the fact that, according to Gol. Hay, there is a vast amount of traffic. The Sheikh of Bahrein has cabled the India Office to know what is being done to replace it. The answer has been that Air India (Tata’s) will shortly start a service. The Sheikh demands a British service. On beino told that this was impossible, he said that he would run a British service himself. The Sheikh really wa v ts someone to run a regular service, but Col. Hay says that he will definitely be interested in a regular charter, whereby we provide the aircraft and. crews and the Sheikh orovides the ground handling arrangements. ' Gol.

In the last paragraph of the letter, reference is made, inter alia, to resumption of stops at Sharjah or Dubai. We have already written to you about the proposals for serving Bahrein in the future, and you are aware that it will not be practicable to make a call with Plymouth or Hythe flying boats at Dubai. I imagine*that you have sufficient information to enable you to reply to the Political Agent with regard to these latest representations. Yours sincerely. P.A.K. Harrison, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.r We have had one or two telephone conversations about the means by which we are to provide an air service for Bahrein, now that the 'C' Glass flying boats have been withdrawn. I am sorry it has not been possible for us to give you our firm proposals before now, but I am glad to be able to tell you that B.O.A.C. will operate a flying boat service starting early in May, once-weekly between the United Kingdom and Bahrein, with a once-weekly shuttle service between Bahrein and Karachi. It is intended to use a tt Plymouth” type of flying boat, which unfortunately cannot call at Dubai, since the Creek there does not provide a sufficient depth of water. The tt C H Class boats could go there because they had a shallower draft. The section from Bahrein to Karachi will therefore, I am afraid, have to be flown non-stop. This will mean that Bahrein will have to depend upon the proposed Indian service for intermediate traffic. Our information about the Indian service is that Tatas are shortly going to operate through to Basra, and we think they have planned Sharjah as a point of call on their route. This should care for the situation. The route between Cairo definitely been decided upon, but made either at Basra or Abadan. and Bahrein has an intermediate The choice will not yet call will be depend upon /traffic P.A.K. Harrison, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.traffic requirements, and we will let you know B.O.A.C.'s recommendation in due course.

SERVICE Since the BOAC has discontinued the use of its 'C Class flying boats in its local service, without substituting other planes, the Company has experienced extreme difficulty in the normal movement of personnel. Examples of the difficulties encountered are as follows. 1. Usual routing for employees and their families proceeding from the United Kingdom to Bahrain is by sea to Egypt and then by air to Bahrain. The last party to proceed by this route, numbering thirteen, were forced to remain in Egypt for fourteen days before the Company was able to arrange their onward passage by TWA aircraft. A further party numbering eighteen is now en route to Egypt and the Company expects to experience similar delay as its on carriage from Egypt has not yet been arranged. 2. On occasion, it is possible to arrange for charter aircraft to move parties such as the above, but unless the capacity of the particular craft can be utilized both to and from Bahrain, the resultant cost per passenger is excessive. 3. Thus far the Company has been able to move its personnel from Bahrain to Cairo but since this movement has been on an 'as avail able' basis, no forward planning has been possible and generally the passengers have been sent out early to ensure malting connection in Egypt with resultant increases in lost time and costs. 4. Eastbound aircraft have generally been filled to capacity, resulting not only in the difficulties in moving personnel from Egypt as mentioned above, but also in making it virtually impossible to move personnel to India by air. In mentioning the difficulties experienced by the Company, no criticism of the local office of the BOAC is intended as this office has been entirely co-operative and has done its utmost to take care of the Company's needs. However, the Company will appreciate any representations which you may deem advisable to make toward improving the local air service for Bahrain.M 'V* X. dislocation caused at Basra and Karachi by cessation of 'C' class service but it is probably considerable* '5« I have already forwarded representation received from Bahrein Petroleum Go® and am now forwarding one from PoG^L. ^ 6 a I have heard rumours that BhDeA.C* hope shortly to start a service -from London terminating at Bahreino This will help but as figures in para: Noo 2 show there is considerable traffic Bahrein - Libai - Karachi and this link is of great.importance ta local Arab merchants, Bahrein ^ Pibai (or Shargah) link is also important for P&gt;C e L* operations.

February, 1947 • Dear Harrison, Our telephone conversation of yesterday evening reminded me that I ought to have written before now to let you know how we were progressing with our examination of the possibility of serving Bahrein by an air service, now that the H C” Class flying boats have been withdrawn. As I explained, our silence does not mean that we have been inactive. In point of fact we have considered a number of alternative ways in which air communications with Bahrein could be restored, but up to this moment have not arrived at a satisfactory solution. I described to you on the telephone one or two of the alternatives we had explored, and the latest proposal for putting on as soon as possible, a flying boat service which would operate between the U.K. and Bahrein, with a shuttle service between Bahrein and Karachi. It is, however, too early to announce this proposal to Bahrein, since if we do this the build-up of the flying boat service to Hong Kong, which is of paramount importance, would be delayed. On the other hand, we do realise the importance of making the necessary provision for Bahrein, at the earliest possible moment, and we would be reluctant to see the Bahrein Government making arrangements otherwise than through B.O.A.C. ,to meet her requirements.As far as we can see at the moment, it is unlikely that any of the proposals which we have already explored, ,—, could be effective until the end of April, I hope, however, to be able to give you some definite information in the very near future.

We entirely agree that such information should be provided and we have, in fact, ever since the inauguration of the Empire Air Mail Scheme been under the impression that Imperial Airways and. subsequently B.O.A.G's local representatives have kept the political authorities in the Gulf fully informed of material changes in their services. In addition, we do, as you know, keep the India Office in the picture as regards proposals for material alterations to the Corporation’s services, for example see ny letter of 15th October reference R. 6557 / 45 /B.O.A. Div. addressed to Miss Holdgate, of which I sent France a copy, relating to the withdrawal of the ’’C” class services. With regard to paragraph 3 of Col. Hay's letter, I am afraid that we too were unaware that this service was laid on by the Corporation, until after the event. In aiy case it was short lived being withdrawn on the 1st February with only three return flights operated.We will, however, ask B.O.A.C. to instruct their representative at Bahrein to notify the Political Resident tVsre at the earliest possible moment of all proposed changes on tj) Corporation's services passing through the Persian Gulf areaT As presumably the India Office will also pass on to Bahrein ary relevant information in this connection that we let you have, I trust Col.

In return the company ply the aircraft to specified places under conditions of lift, load, etc. which they lay down. 3. Regarding the point that we, and not the Bahrain (jovernment should conduct the negotiations, personally I don»t see how we can do it. We should have no position unless we negotiated on behalf of His Majesty's Government. I thiiuc it would be better for us to instruct the Bahrain Government, but a point which occurs to me is that possibly B.O.A.C. should invite the co-operation of a purely British company in maintaining a Persian Gulf feeder-service. one gathers that B.O.A.C. consider that they have a monopoly for Bahrain, but this indeed is not so in fact. 'hey nave an ’ established position, but this does not give them the right to transfer good-will earned over a long period of yoars to a non-British concern. 4. *C f Class has already ceased and it is most unlikely that it can be re-started, and unless B.O.A.C. can laake satisfactory arrangements early to carry passengers and freight under British auspices, they will increase the bitter local disappointment at the sudden cessation of the public carrying service which they have operated for some dosen years. They will not only have let the public down - I am speaking for the Bahrain Agency area only - but will have driven travellers to seek passages with foreign lines. Travellers are already using T.W.A. and I hear that in the quite near future K.L.M. are to re-conaaence their passenger service using Dhahran. I think, therefore, that either the Bahrein Government or B.O.A.C. should commence/to institute a Gulf feeder-service and this could well be the lines I have already suggested.

I enclose a copy of a letter I have received from the Bahrain Government. k. There is no doubt that the gap in communica tions caused by the cessation of the *C T Class will be seriously felt, particularly because of the paucity of shipping. This break is looked upon as failure of the British to fulfil their unwritten obligations to Bahrain and its people. It is quite true the Shaikh has none a lot to assist air facilities in Bahrain, even to the extent of presenting a portion of the Muharraq landing-ground, and I fully sympathise with his reluctance to allow Bahrain to become dependent on a non-British Air-Line. Further, I appreciate his pro-British attitude. 3. The situation as I see it is that in 1946 His Highness agreed to amendments to the Civil Air Agreement, and under the new paragraph 4 he ceded to His Majesty*s Government the right to grant on his behalf to foreign aircraft the use of the aerodrome for special pifl?poses. It* was not at that time contemplated for a moment in Bahrain that His Majesty’s Government would permit a non-British Company to take over local passenger and freight traffic. In any case the reservation was made that His Highness would be previously informed of the arrangement made, vide Residency Express Letter No.391-S dated the 5th April, 1946. I request, therefore', confirmation that, in fact. His Majesty’s Government have given local air carrying rights to Tata Air Lines or £11 India so that I can inform the Shaikh officially. 4. I understand that the British Overseas Airways Corporation have notified the Bahrain Government concerning the transfer of traffic on this route to one or the other of the above mentioned concerns. This is in contravention of paragraph 5 of the Civil Air Agreement and I request that B.O.A.C. be so informed, and asked, as regards the air trans port facilities for Bahrain, to address me and not the Bahrain Government direct. 5. In addition to the complaint made in the enclosure to this letter, the Shaikh has spoken to me on the subject, and also Abdulla bin Isa has represented the matter. They would both like an air-line to be based on Bahrain and from the air-passenger lists only it is patently ' clear that local passenger traffic is sufficient to warrant the continuation of a regular Persian Gulf Air-Service. I suggest that this should be entrusted to a British Company under inclusive charter to the Bahrain Government. This might be on the lines of the A.I.O.C. charter service, and I request authority to inform the Bahrain Government that they may make enquiries. (SGD .J A.C.GnunGWiiY # Political Agent, Bahrain.

Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Goverhment of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. His Britannic Majesty»s political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that His Highness Shaikh Sulman has instructed me to write to you on the subject of the cessation of 'C' Class flying boats which will apparently result in local air services between Bahrain, Iraq and Karachi being discontinued for an indefinite period. His Highness is disappointed and gravely concerned by the failure of the B.O.A.G. to maintain the air services between India and Iraq upon which the people of this State have come to rely when travelling on commercial business and for other reasons. The cessation of the air service and the immense difficulties which are encountered by persons who wish to travel on the B.I. steamers will render Bahrain almost inaccessible. This is a matter which will seriously affect the pearl industry as the pearl merchants and brokers are compelled to travel constantly between , Bahrain and India. His Highness wishes me to remind you that from the very beginning he has always done all that was possible to assist Imperial Airways and then the British Overseas Airways Corporation to establish themselves in Bahrain and has facilitated their work here and he considers that even a temporary suspension of the air service to and from Bahrain should have been avoided and that due regard should be paid to the needs and the interests of the people of his country. His Highness now regrets that the American air service which is established in Saudi Arabia does not operate in Bahrain. His Highness would like immediately to open negotiations with Air Misr or any British'air line which is operating in this locality with a view to inducing another Air Company to inaugurate an air line connecting Bahrain with Karachi, Iraq and the Gulf ports. His Highness is not disposed to become dependent on the Tata Air Line but would prefer to see some other British air line undertake the Gulf services which until nov: have been provided by British Overseas Airways Corporation.

NQ. 88 -S the 14th JsfiTrsry, , 194^. I am desired to refer to your Express Letter N o.C/54 dat ed 7th January 1947 and to say that, with reference to paragraph 4, Colonel Hay agrees with you that should not adaress the Bahrain Government direct in other than routine matters. He observes that, since the Civil Air Agreement was concluded in 1934, it is possible that its provisions have not come to the notice of the local b.Q.A.C. management. He would be grateful if you would bring them to the notice of Parker and ask him to be guided by them in future. 2, With regard to paragraph 5 of your letter I am to ask you to be good enough to explain the meaning of the term 'inclusive charter'. I am to add that prima facie Colonel Hay is opposed to the Bahrain Government’s negotiating with any Air Transport Company or similar organization except through us. He also considers any action on the lines suggested premature until it is known that our representations for the continuation of 'the ’C’ Class service or some thing similar in its place have failed. 3.

Althougja^we are not bound under agreement to give the Rulers of Bahrain and Sharjah prior information of the establishment of any air service, my predecessor undertook to give the Shaikh of Bahrain such information in respect of any foreign air service authorised to operate through his territory and I consider as a matter of courtesy that we should give the Rulers concerned prior notice of all air services landing in and serving their territories, if only to enable them to inform their subjects of any passage and mail facilities that may be made available. 5. For instance, I have learnt casually through local officers that since the cessation of the T C f Class service it has been arranged that a Lockheed aircraft should travel between Karachi and Sharjah regularly every Wednesday carrying mails and passengers. Surely I ought to have been informed officially of the establishment of this service both in view of its possible use for Government purposes and to enable me to inform the public through the Shaikh of Sharjah? 4. If you see no objection I should be grateful if action could be taken to ensure that I am given prior notice of the establishment of any new air service landing in the Gulf States and of any subsequent alterations in its schedule.

Mr. Curran American Civil Air Attache saw the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Civil Aviation during his visit to Cairo and enquired as to the British attitude towards the Arab League policy of refusing the fifth freedom rights over the routes adequately served by local Air lines. He said that the United States Dutch Ethiopians and Persians had refused the suggestion of the Arab League pattern of Air Transport Agreement and also the French though they might in his opinion give way on this point. He assumed that His Majesty^ Government would refuse to sign the Arab League type of Agreement and the State Department had tentatively suggested that all foreign countries concerned should form common front against the Arab League policy. Egyptian authorities had assured him that until this point had been settled United States would be granted three monthly extension of their authorisations to operate. He assumed that the Egyptians would finance the grant of same concessions to other foreign countries. Finally Curran said he would expect the Egyptian Government to delay ratification of the United States Egyptian Air Transport Agreement. He explained that while the agreement CypKer/OTP CIVIL AVIATION DISTRIBUTION FROM CAIRO TO FOREIGN OFFICE \ V ^°.197 X. V 22nd January, 1947.

I am afraid there is no prospect of continuing the 'C' Class flying boat service, which hitherto provided facilities for the carriage of passengers in and out df Bahrein. As you probably know, this was the so-called 'Horseshoe” service, and the ”C” Class flying boats used thereon have been in service for nearly 10 years. They have reached the end of their useful life for lack of spares,and much as we regret their withdrawal, it is technically impracticable to keep them going any longer. We are now examining with B.O.A.C. whether, and to what extent, the gap, so far as Bahrein is concerned, can be filled. The Hythes which operate a thrice weekly service to Australia, a once weekly service to Singapore and a once weekly service to Hong Kong, all pass through Behrein, and there will be no difficulty in arranging for them to carry Bahrein mail, both Eastbound and V/estbound. E.P. Donaldson, Esq. , C India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W. 1. /Tov 5 l To find capacity for passengers to and from Bahrein, however, is the difficulty. The Hythe services primarily serve Australia, Malaya and Hong Kong, and because the demand for passenger accommodation far exceeds the available capa* 1 *^', the whole of the 22 seats with which the Hythes are equipped are filled with end to end traffic. Whether it will be possible to allocate some of the space for local traffic in and out of Bahrein at the expense of long haul traffic from end to end of the routes, is at least doubtful, but we are giving the question close examination, and will write again as soon as possible.© iI.

DONALDS(» 7 f &lt;■ %Mr .Donaldson I am sorry to have delayed this. I was hoping to discuss it with Mr .Maxwell of B.O.A.C., as he and I used to deal with matters of this kind on the Middle East Air Transport Board when I was in Cairo. Now I understand Mr .Maxwell is in Cairo himself, and will be there for the next few weeks, which rather fortifies what follows. A year or two ago this matter would have been dealt with by the Middle East Air Transport Board, which is in a much better position than anyone else to assess the various needs and to allocate resources in accordance with various needs in that part of the world. B.CJUC. I think regards itself as concerned primarily with the main through routes, and would prefer, or at least would be perfect*#ly ready, to leave the local and regional stuff to the territorial authorities with whom they, the B.O.A.C., might be associated in promoting aviation enterprises.. .Thus, a joint Anglo-Egyptian enterprise is contemplated for the U.K.-Egypt traffic. And the Middle East traffic, including the Gulf traffic, might similarly be catered for by an Egyptian or Indian concern with which B.O.A.C. might be associated. Now, however, B.O.A.C. seem to be withdrawing one of their main line services of the past, namely what was called the Horseshoe Service, from South Africa northwards to Cairo, and then eastwards and beyond to India, and it looks as if they were doing this without arrangements having been made to cater for the local traffic. I think you might add to the draft something /likelike this:- H We understand that in recent years a matter like this would have been dealt with in the first instance at least by the Middle East Air Transport Board in Cairo, which was in a position to assess needs within the Middle East area and to allocate resources in accordance with those needs. We are not sure whether the MJC*A.T.Board still functions, and^ if what its views are as regards this question of the Persian Gulf traffic. If this question has not been dealt with by the M.E JUT .Board, would it not be advisable that it should be aokud to dcr e&gt;C4^C, I think we might send a copy of this correspondence to the Foreign Office with a view to their weighing in on our side. I am sure it would be a great misfortune if the Gulf and other parts of the Middle East were to be let down in this way, but of course the Ministry of Civil Aviation is not really in a position to judge ,of that, and needs to have it impressed upon it. without delay?' 13.147/ I attach the file a out J. 0. ..0, services in the Persian G-ulf fran which you will see that we have seen in ccrrespondence with the h inis try pi Civil Aviation but have had no very satisfactory replies as yet.

Jiwani, Shargah,- Bahrain and Basr of this, ' &gt; but nothing further has been heard 4* Cessation of ”0' Class service linking Egypt, Iraq., Persian Gulf and India will cause serious inconvenience to all classes of passengers and in particular will make communicating both •passenger and mail between Bahrain and the Trucial Coast very difficult. This is a serious matter in view of the fact that the Political Agent, Bahrain, is responsible for the Trucial Coast and there is considerable activity there owing bbth to P.C.L. ! s operations and friction between the local Sheikhs. 5* I understand that when 'C' Glass service ceases a few passages may be made available in Sunderlands plying between the United Kingdom. Cairo and In.dia for passengers to and from Bahrain, but these will inevitably be reserved for high priority passengers, mostly officials. Employees of Oil Companies and the commercial classes generally will be severely handicapped, especially in view of present execrable steamer service &gt; 6 .

Should the Air Officer Commanding address me as I suggest I will refer the case formally with my comments. Meanwhile I would only remark that under the agreement of the 23rd July, 194^, between the Royal Air Force and the Bahrain Petroleum Company (of which I have not even got a copy) the latter clearly have the first option to purchase the installation and I see no reason why they should be willing to forego this option. 4.

Dated the 21st of January, 1947 To: With reference to the correspondent Political Resident, Persian Gulf. I with my printed Letter No.C/1334 dated the 27th November. 1946 . I enclose a copy of letter No. ASLO/ 1701/5/w dated the 12th January, 1947, from the Air Staff Liaison officer from which you will see that I am requested to acquaint the Chief Local Representa tive with the Air Ministry’s proposition to lease the bulk fuel installation at Muharraq to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company for the supply of aviation fuel to B.O.A.C. aircraft. I am also asked to obtain the Bahrain Petro leum Company’s approval to the proposition. 2. The proposition to lease the tanks is new and does not seem to have figured in previous discussions. Relevant points and comments are: (I) that by the Political Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company the areas used by His Majesty’s Government for defence purposes are excluded from the Deed of Further Modi fication. In view of the fact that the Royal Air Force consider that they can now dispense with the installations it is diffi cult to maintain that the tanks are required for defence purposes. (ii) Article I of the Civil Air Agreement gives His Majesty’s Government the exclusive right to establish and maintain aerodromes and ancillary services. The tanks are certainly an ancillary service. (iii) In the Deed of Further Modification the Bahrain Petroleum Company are given the exclusive right to operate storage tanks. This right is, however, subject to the terras of the political Agreement /Ji) abov^Z. (iv) The Bahrain petroleum Company in direct correspondence with the Air Staff Liaison Officer agreed, vide extract from agreement covering the erection by BAPCO of the fuel installations at the Royal Air Force Station Muharraq, that ’•Should the Royal Air Force aviation fuel installation referred to in this con tract at a future date no longer be required for Royal Air Force purposes, the contractor /will be given....- 2 - ■f', will be given the first option to purchase the tanks, pumps or other equipment at such prices as may be mutually agreed between the contractor and the Air officer Commanding, Royal Air Force, »lraq &amp; Persia, having regard to the original purchase prices paid by the Air Ministry under this contract,” The Royal Air Force now state that the 'Muharraq installation is not an economical proposition, and that the installation could now be dispensed with”. I find it difficult to see how - in view of the condi tion made as recently as 1945 - the Royal Air Force can ask me to make a proposition denying the Bahrain Petro leum company the option to purchase. While it is problem atical whether or not BAPCO will wish to take up the option they should, I think, be given the opportunity. The only way I can see to avoid this would be for the Royal Air Force to wi&amp;hdraw the words '’could now be dispensed with”. 3, The Royal Air Force negotiated the agreement of 23rd July, 194A, direct, and before either I or the Air Staff Liaison Officer can make the proposition to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the point in paragraph (iv) above needs clarifying, and I should be grateful for instructions that I may take the point up with the Air Staff Liaison Officer. 4. A further point is that the R,A.F. letter states ”for the refuelling of 3.0.A.C, aircraft'’, and does not take into consideration foreign aircraft, presumably it is intended that all aircraft shall be refuelled from the tanks. I should be grateful for instructions if I should taice this point up also wish the Air Staff Liaison Officer. 3d./- A.C. GALLOWAY Political Agent, Bahrain. ATTESTED . Sd./- N.

Reference is invited to this office's corres^ of even reference dated 14th and 24th of October, 1946. drawing their requirements of 100 octane aviation fuel for refuelling B. O.A.C. aircraft from the R.A.F. bulk fuel installation at MUharraq, and future policy as to whether such a procedure should be continued is now under considera tion at Air Ministry. 3. The R.A.F. consumption of this grade of fuel at Bahrain is daily decreasing, and in the circumstances, it is thought that to continue the use of the Muharraq installa tion is not an economical proposition, and that the installa tion could now be dispensed with. Future R.A.F. requirements would be met from barrelled stocks despatched from Abadan as necessary. At the same time there is a suggestion from Air Ministry to let the Muharraq tanks on hire to the Anglo- Iranian oil Company, who at the present time, import 100 octane fuel for the conjoint use of B.O.A.C./R.A.F. 4. Before this installation can be hired to Anglo-Iranian Oil Company however, the approval of the Bahrain Petroleum Company must be obtained, and it would be appreciated if you would acquaint the Chief Local Representative of BAPCO with the Air Ministry's proposal and obtain this approval. 5. The two main points at issue are:- (a) Violation of the clause in the agreement between BAPCO and the Sheikh of Bahrain per taining to BAPCO’s exclusive right of bulk storage in Bahrain. (b) Section 7 of the agreement between the Royal Air Force and BAPCO regarding the erection mt&amp;y BAPCO of the R.A.F. fuel installation at Muhar raq. This section pertains to BAPCO's option to purchase the tanks when no longer required for R.A.F. purposes. R.A.F. AVIATION FUEL TANKAGE - MUHARRAQ . 2.

Air transport is now a normal mode of travel. The Kuwait Oil Company have for some years past been using aircraft in Kuwait territory, and Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., have been accorded permission to use it in all the Gulf Shaikhdoms (Resi- Y-fdency express letter No.95_3*-iL# dated the 23rd November 1945,and connected correspondence!. The American Arabian Oil Company,of which the Bahrain Petroleum Company is now part, may therefore complain of discrimination if their request is refused. Moreover, while article 4(b) of the Deed of Modification, dated 29th Dec ember 1934, does not specifically confer the right to use air craft or to construct landing grounds, it should in ntf opinion, be interpreted generously and in the light of present day conditions, particularly as it would be difficult to resist a request on the part of the Bahrain Petroleum Company to modify this article so as to confer such rights. 3. Under the Civil Air Agreement with the Ruler of Bahrain H#M.Government possess the exclusive right to construct aerodromes in Bahrain territory. Provided it is made clear to the Bahrain Petroleum Company that the construction of a landing strip at Awali is a concession and not a right, in view of the distance between Awali and the landing ground at Muharraq I see no objection to such permission being accorded. 4* I should be glad to learn whether H.M.Government concur in the views expressed above, in which case permission will be accorded (a) to the Arabian American Oil Company for their private aeroplane to land in Bahrain and (b) to the Bahrain Petroleum Company for the construction of a landing strip at Awali.

ARAMCO have requested permission for their small privately owned aeroplane to make trips to Bahrain for co ordination of work with their affiliate company - BAPCO. They wish to save time and inconvenience of launch trip for their own and top managerial staff of BAPCO and other important personages. They would not use the *plane as an ordinary personnel carrier. They would wish to build a small landing strip at Awali. 3. As regards the flights! In view of the existence of the launch service to and from the mainland I see no objection and I should be grateful for early confirmation to wnich if received before the amendments to the Civil Air Agreement are completed, I would obtain His Highness* con sent. If received after the completion of the amendments this would not be necessary. 4. As regards the landing strip to be located in BAPCO area at Awali. It appears fcanra to me that ‘BAPCO have the right under Article 4(b) of the Deed of Further Modifications to construct a landing strip if they think one necessary. Although they have not communicated with me on the subject of the strip officially I am aware that they do wish to co-operate with ARAMCC and probably would apply to me if permission were not accorded. In the circumstances I think the terms of the Civil air Agreement apply and I should be grateful for confirmation that His Majesty’s Government have no objection. ATTLSTKD . Sd./- A.C.

There is no record here of any such possibility having been considered by the Bahrain Government. The statement that the outlay would be an investment is hardly correct since the aerodrome would never return a commen surate dividend. From the Bahrain Government point of view, therefore, it cannot be considered practical, much as they may wish to assist in the development of air communications in the Gulf.

It therefore covers a range of related topics such as the amendment and renewal of the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement, money due to the Ruler of Bahrain under the agreement, amendments to landing fees, aviation facilities at Bahrain, and alterations to be made to British Overseas Airways Corporation services (BOAC) to/from Bahrain. The topic covered in the most depth is the termination of the BOAC Class C (Calcutta) flying boat service, and the consequences of the subsequent reduction in services for Bahrain. The file also includes correspondence on proposals for the provision of alternative services, and the final introduction by BOAC of a replacement Plymouth flying boat service. The provision of services by alternative air lines is also briefly considered.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (William Rupert Hay), the Political Agent at Bahrain, officials of the India Office (from August 1947 the Commonwealth Relations Office), and officials of the Ministry of Civil AviationThe file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
