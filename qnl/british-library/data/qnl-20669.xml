Dear Mr. G-idson, A short while ago I mentioned to you the desire of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to mstal and to operate in Bahrein 3 ..'ireless Transmission Apparatus which will permit of voice and hey transmission between the Company’s Station in ^ . ... Bahrein and the Mainland of Saudi-Arabia. These means of communication are found l-o be necessary to the businesses of both Companies; they would be available and, without doubt, used at all times throughout the day and night. As you know, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company is a Corporation of United States American origin, operating on the Arabian Mainland under a Petroleum Concession held from king Ibn Sa’oud. The Company is now in the course of erecting a Wireless Station at Dammam for use in the general purposes of its business. In addition, various working parties, scattered as they are over a wide area without any other means of communicatioi with each other or with Headquarters or with Bahrein, are being equipped with portable Wireless Transmission and Receiving Sets so that their progress may be facilitated and their well-being assured in the event of trouble arising in any way, including accidents of a serious nature. The view of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company is that a radio installation at Bahrein with a radiophone frequency over 30 megacycles and of low power, and being highly directional between Stations, would be sufficient for all practical purposes and be unlikely to interfere with any other Wireless Operations in the Gulf, and if there were no objection from His Majesty’s Government to it, that is the Installation the Company would instal in Bahrein. Both/2 . Both the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited believe that it vould be of advantage to them if the 7ireless Apparatus in Bahrein could, in case of need, be connected to the Telephone System by which The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited receives and transmits ordinary 1and line communications at and from its Camp at A7a1i. The use of the Apparatus would not be in any way competitive with Cable &amp; Wireless Limited. Lvery effort would be made by both Companies at all times to avoid interference with the operations in the Gulf of His Majesty’s Air Force and Navy. No approach has yet been made by the Company to the Government of Bahrein and unless you think it advisable to do so, the Company does not intend to make any such approach until the views of His Majesty’s Government are made known to the Company. Might I ask you now to accept this letter as a formal request addressed to His Majesty’s Government by California Arabian Standard Oil Company with the concurrence of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited for permission to erect and use on Bahrein Island, the Apparatus referred to above ? If you require any further information from either the California ^rablan Standard Oil Company or The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited and you wi11 let me know, we shall be pleased to endeavour to supply it.

In reply to your letter P.Z.7433/1936 of the 11th November last about the proposal submitted by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to set up a ^ — wireless transmitter at Bahrein? I have now received the views of members of the Imperial Communications Committee? which are as follows. the erection of a wireless transmitter as proposed? provided that it would cause no interference with such wireless stations as may be maintained by His Majesty's Government? or with the Cable and Wireless Station at Bahrein? and that it limits its messages to those between the Company's representatives on the mainland or travelling between the mainland and Bahrein? and confines such messages to the legitimate business of the Company. The Air Ministry suggest that the right should be reserved to curtail the operation of the station at any time? should circumstances ever arise to demand it? and their agreement to its installation is covered by the proviso that it will not encroach upon the rights of Cable and Wireless Limited under any existing agreement. The Ireasury have consulted the Chairman and Secreuary of the Imperial Communications advisory Committee The Service Departments see no objection to and have ascertained that Cable and v/ireless Limited are themselves ? prepared to make the necessary arrangements for the/the inauguration of a wireless telegraph service between Bahrein and Damman, subject to the concurrence of all parties concerned. n copy of a letter from the Chairman of the Company to Sir Campbell Stuart is attached. The next step, therefore, appears to be for you to invite the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to get into touch with Cable and Wireless Limited to discuss details, such as hours of service and wave lengths, as suggested in Mr. Wilshaw’s letter.

The statement in paragraph 2 of that Express letter does not appear to be correct, the reason being that neither the Local Rep resentative of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company nor the Local Manager of Cable and Wireless Limited hatsk been informed of the facts by their respective Companies. It now appears that the Oil Company obtained permission over a year ago from King Ibn Saud to operate a private radio telephone on condition that they could arrange that the installation in Bahrain was the property of and was managed by the Oil Company. It is rumoured that the reason s. 6.

On the other hand Cable and Wireless are apparently unwilling to come to any arrangement which does not provide for their possession and control of the installation in Bahrain. I understand that the matter has been discussed in London by the two Companies, Major Monroe representing Cable and Wireless Limited and Mr. Hamilton representing the Oil Company. 3.

It has been Explained to me that the reason for this new line of approach is the Interminable delay which has ensued since December 1958 when, on the advice of the India Office, negotiations w^ere opened between the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and Cjible and Wireless [limited, in London, (cf. (Dndia Office Printed Letter No# P#Z# 3565 dated the 50th December 1958). The Oil Company’s representa tives inform me that these negotiations now rest with a statement nade at a meeting between the two Companies in May 1940 that Eable and Wireless Limited had instructed their Local Manager in Karachi to tf get in touch with Bahrain and to assist the California Arabian /- (Signature) ui L4. (Designation)2 Arabian Standard Oil Company in the direction they wanted 11 . y* IT? As you are aware from my Express Letter No. C/430 dated the 22nd May Cable and Wireless actually sought from me confirma tion that they would remain sole concessionaires for tele graphic work in Bahrain. 3. I have not of course consulted the Bahrain Government pending further instructions. The matter is of some complexi ty since on the one hai it appears highly doubtful from your Express Letter No. 572-S dated the 6th June 1940 whether Cable and Wireless have in fact a monopoly position here, and (b) there are obvious benefits from our point of view in facilitating the establishment of direct wireless telephonic communication between the two Oil Companies; while on the other hand (a) there are equally obvious disadvantages in ini tialing the principle that oil companies in two separate territories may establish direct telephonic communication (cf. possibility of Petroleum Concessions Limited applying for similar facilities with Qatar, Kuwait, the Trucial Coast and possibly even Kirkuk) and (b) all external communications, save those established for Service purposes in w&amp;tine, should be concentrated in one organisation in order to avoid inter national complications, 4. I am however impressed by the importance, from the point of view of His Majesty 1 ^ Government in wartime, of facilitating telephonic communication between Bahrain and Dhammann The Bahrain Refinery is now able, subject to the availability of tankers, to dispose of one million barrels of refined products per month. To the best of my knowledge and belief the Bahrain field cannot safely produce more than a rough average of 20,000 barrels a day and the balance must therefore come from Arabia. A single company cannot operate efficiently without interior telephonic communica tion with its various branches, and it seems obvious that this /-this internal communication must be expanded when the Company draws a considerable part of its crude supplies from another company. The possibility might also be borne in mind that as there is now considerable doubt whether a large refinery will ever be constructed at Has fanura the expansion of the Bahrain Refinery might conceivably result. It would almost certainly not result if inter-Company telephonic com- munication were not assured. 5. It appears that direct negotiations between the two Companies have reached an impasse. The Oil Company have per mission from Ibn Saud to instal wireless telephonic communi cation with Bahrain only on condition that it communicates direct with the sister oil company in Bahrain. The object of Cable and Wireless Limited is to make communication with any other organisation in Bahrain but their own an impossibili ty. It may, I think, be accepted that C.A.S.O.C. woi^irl iic T little hope of succeeding in any effort to induce Ibn oaud to modify his decision^ but on the other hand I a.m not aware what obligations His Majesty*s Government are under so far as Cable and Wireless are concerned. Possibly however these obligations would not extend to causing His Majesty*s Govern ment to abandon interests of their own merely to support a commercial company. It need not I think be feared that tele phonic communication between the tw/o Oil Companies will serve to diminish the revenue of Cable and Wireless in Bahrain and even In the very improbable event of there teing some minor loss Cable and Wireless could till regard with considerable satisfaction their immense takings from the two Oil Companies for cables to other parts of the world. 6. Possibly a solution might be found on the following lines. I have been informed that Ibn Saud insists on con trolling the proposed wireless telephone in Dhahran, that is to /-- 4 to say his own men would «call« Bahrain for all conversa tions and would be able to listen in. Similarly on the Bahrain side His Majesty^s Government, as controller of Bahrain* s external communications, might well insist on controlling contacts with Dhahran and, for purposes of censorship in wartime, on listening in to conversations. His Majesty*s Government might find it convenient to employ, at the Oil Company*s expense, men provided by Cable and Wireless; and if the Bahrain installation wrere in the Oil Company*s camp Ibn Saud should not object to this arrangement. Admittedly such an arrangement is a little complicated, but not only might it well le found workable and so serve our interests as suggested in para- appear an unattractive precedent to others with less important commercial interests here. Political Agent, BahrainCopy or letter dated 25th June 1940 from M.W. Thornburg, hohrain Petroleum Company Limited, to Political Agent, Bah** rain. Dear Sir, me eiforts we are making to insure uninterrupted operation au lull capacity of our oil production, refining ouic, shipping at Bahrain makes it urgently necessary that our operations here be closely co-ordinated with those a ' ev/ m il€S away in Saudi Arabia. Hot only are we faced with tne possibility of losing considerable numbers of our British employees for active service, but the uncertainty of shipping makes the replacement of both men and of essential materials and supplies uncertain. only .it is/by the closest possible co-ordination of oper ations between the Bahrain Petroleum Company and The Caliiornia Arabian Standard Oil Company (of identical own ership) that the full benefit of their combined resources can be assured. To this end the parent companies at home have issued general instructions that uninterrupted full capacity operation at Bahrain is to be fiven priority over all other parent company interests in this area. while the shortest distance between Bahrain and the mainland is only about 15 miles our launch route from A1 Khobar to Manama is 28 miles, through a treacherous area of imefs and shoals, and made more hazardous by sudden and severe winds and cross currents. The passage is never Made at night except by shallow draft native launches. As you know we c,re s P arin o no exiort to find and mark hetber channels, but j communication by boat will for a long time limit us to practically independent operation of tnese two neighbouring companies. You /-2 - -ou know too that more than one third of our crude supply for Bahrain Refinery is brought over from Arabia by barge when conditions permit and by tanker from Has Tanura vdijn necessary. Most of this supply muct be continued if our Refinery here is to maintain full output. view gi uiicse circumstance's we request permission irom the ^anrain Government to install and operate a small wireless set 9 in our office here, capable of direct and con tinuous communication with company headquarters in Dharan* we wish wo use this means of communication solely for internal companv business, in the same way that we use our own tele phone system between our offices and refinery or shiooinn wharf here. As for t he possibility of interfering with Imperial Airways' communication, no real ground for objection can exist. v.e have had many wireless sets operating in thisiimmediate area for a long time, both in Arabia and within our own Bahrain concession, with absolutely no history of interference. We are not asking for permission to install a more powerful station, but merely for permission to use the ones we now have for talking across our concession boundary. ' e recognise that in present circumstances provision must be made for censorship over such communications and are ready to meet any reasonable demands to that end; such as providing a listening station in any Bahrain Government or office, or paying for a censor assigned to full time supervision of conversations at our station. ?or your information, Irtie Saudi Arabian Government has consented to operation of such communications between our offices, with the proviso that the company station in Arabia shall work only with our private company station in'■r sjc 3 - i * Bahrain, and not with a commercial or any other station here, they recognize the importance of having an inter-company communication system for the conduct of our local affairs but will not permit this to be extended - for example - by involving Cable and Wireless in what they consider, as we do, purely a local operating service. /e have xkx on hand all equipment necessary to put this communication system into effect, and because of our urgent need for it we hope that this request will receive prompt attention.«— t™ ■y ■ W, GOVERNMENT OP INDIA. ; SUSMI^c i y':''-:. ■ 110 Date.

So far Bahrain Petroleum Company and California Arabian Standard Oil Company have got on very well without telephone. The journey by launch only takes about l-a/ 2 to 2 hours even in rough weather. They are two foreign owned companies whose profits are entirely enjoyed by and remitted to the United States of America. Their products have hitherto either been exported to Italy or to destinations which compete with Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, and the moment it suits them to mstal a refinery at Has Tanura they will do so, no matter what action we take. Bahrain has ample oil to provide for greater royalties than its Shaikhs can spend reasonably and if any more oil is required from this area Anglo-Iranian Oil Company will be delighted to produce any quantity with marked political advantages for ourselves. 6# My views therefore are that (a) Cables and Wireless have a monopoly of external traffic in Bahrain and should keep it.

As the previous reference is in Ziarat, I am unable to take any action; but have sent a copy of the letterto Mr. Weightman by air mail, to enable him to address you without delay. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant for Political Agent, Bahrain4 ?'' Copy of a letter Wo. PA-50 dated, the 17th August 1940, from K.B. Thornburg, Esquire, to Political Agent, Bahrain. You are aware that v/e have applied for permission to operate a short-wave telephone communication system between here and our associated Company office in Dharan, solely as a means of gaining effective coordination of our closely related operations at these two places. This letter is to inform you that we do now have a transmitter and receiver installed in our offices at Awal for use when and if the requested permission is obtained and arrangements for censoring are completed; and to inform you that this set has not been used since we com pleted our marine exploration woek several months ago, and that it has never been used for communicating with Saudi j Arabia or any other point outside the limits of our concess] ion. Then it is used it will be only in connection with our own internal operations and under strict executive supervision to insure that no conversations of an undesir able character are held. In connection with our application, I invite your attention to the fact that two days ago we were obliged to reduce our refinery throughput below its maximum capacity for the first time since the war began. This was because i every tank was filled and no ships in to lift our products. The immediate reason for the shut down, from the operating viewpoint, was that we have set aside one large tank for holding Admiralty fuel in readiness to avoid any delay such as was unfortunately necessary a few weeks ago; and that we must keep two large tanks in crude service to receiv crude by tanker from Has Tanura. Perhaps nothing can be done about the first of theset but we can make the two crude tanks available by increasing^ the movement of crude by barge from A1 Khobar to Zellaq by putting lights along the channel for night hauling and generally increasing the capacity of this system to allow i discontinuance of the tanker haul from Has Tanura to Sitra. This work was started several days ago and should be comple ted shortly. It will cost us around 2 30,000 for install ation and about # 50,000 a year increased operating cost, compared to tanker movements, none of which can be justifieJ if we consult only our own commercial interests. I will add that the day before yesterday I cabled for and promptly received authorisation to proceed with the construction of 227,000 barrels additional storage. This represents an investment of about # 300,000 which will be without commercial value to us for a long time to come. This tankage, however, will not be available for six to ten x months. I am most reluctant to proceed with night hauling from A1 Khobar until we have telephonic communication i established. We have 'already lost four employees’ lives between here and A1 Khobar directly because of lack of l communication. /- !•i&lt; * # * * * - 2 - Communication, The channel is dangerous even in daytime, because of reefs, currents and weather. Cur barges are 20 years old and because of the gassy crude must be towed with long lines to avoid fire risk. iUven with all daylight hauling they hang up on a bar or reef about twice a month. Under present conditions we arevilling to take unusual risks with our men and equipment, but urge that consideration be given to the efforts we are making. ■ou know,of course, that we are dependent upon Arabia for more than one third of our regular crude through put; that is, the Bahrain field is not capable of pre- due ing quite two-thirds of our present refining capacity.( * I C c L? f kfidential Ho.C/714.

Sir, I havethe honour to attach copies of a telegram which v^as handed t o me this morning by Mr. F.W. Ohliger, of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. 2. Mr. Ohliger informed, me that on a.previous occasion a telegram which his Company regarded as being of extreme % importance, had taken nearly a week to reach San Francisco; and it was therefore his intention that the master of the r.V. lf El Segundo' 1 (Panamanian registry) should send the pre sent telegram as soon as she got to sea, i.e. in the course of that afternoon. I 3. I asked Mr, Ohliger whether he had considered the possible consequences of infringing the monopoly of Cable and.Wireless Limited, and also the international aspect of the situation. Mr. Ghliger replied that he knew that it had been agreed that masters of merchant ships in East Indian waters should not send messages other than those originating on board; and even instanced the Cairo Conference of 1933 on, apparently, this subject. He said, however, that he2 knew of many instances in which its provisions had been broken. step, whatever the consequences, he must understand that I could not give any kind of consent to his proposal, if that was his object in coming to see me. He replied that he had merely co^-e f, as a matter of co-operation”, in spite of the nothing said to anyone. 5. After hr. Chliger's departure, I telephoned Commander May, the Secretary to the Senior Havitl Officer; and conveyed to him the gist of this letter, as the Senior Ziaval Officer was not then ashore. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. 4.

Subject - Communication by radio telephone between the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, Sir, Reference correspondence on the subject cited above resting with my Express letter No.T/115-10/15 dated the 31st August 1940, I enclose apopy of a letter, No. CON-664 dated the 27th October 1940, from the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 2. After the air raid temporary and provisional permission was given by the Assistant Political Agent for the Oil Company in Bahrain to communicate with Dhahran by radio telephone in order (a) to obtain immediate information of damage done there and (b) to co-ordinate efforts of both Companies in securing transport for the evacuation of American women and children. The management of the Bahrain Petroleum Company at the time seemed able to think of little else gut the instant removal of American wives and families and it was clear at the time that they would not return to normal until some arrangements had been made. Evacuation will shortly be complete and communication for this purpose will cease. It was impossible at the time to arrange for the proper censoring of conversations between the two Companies but the Assistant Political Agent was kept fully informed /- j———informed of what was being said and a warning was given that conversations should be strictly limited to the subject of evacuation arrangements and that movements and names of ships other than neutral ships should not be mentioned* 3. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company at Dhahran are in constant communication with parties operating in the oil field by means of radio telephone equipment* These parties who are often operating at considerable distances from Dhahran will be on the watch for aircraft in order to warn the Company 1 s headquarters at Dhahran* It is now known that the aircraft which carried out the raid approached from a westerly direction and it seems highly desirable that use should be made of these listening posts in Arabia in order to obtain some warning of an air raid on Bahrain* 4. It is therefore suggested that after evacuation arrange ments have been completed permission should be given to the Bah rain Petroleum Company to use their radio telephone equipment purely for alarm purposes.

CON-664 His Brtiannic Majesty^ Political Agent, Bahrain. Dear Sir, As you know, we have with the permission of the Acting P.A. and the S.N.O., been in radio-telephonic communication with Casoc since this morning after the air raid. The radio messages fall in two groups (i) Conversations about personnel matters, such as methods of evacuation, who is to be evacuated, and so on. These are extremely useful at present as a n interchange of letters takes up to 48 hours. As soon as evacuation is completed this method of communication may cease. (ii) A wave band from Casoc to Awali is constantly open for alarm purposes. All Casoc outstations have radio transmitting sets and in the event of anyone hearing or seeing aircraft A1 Khobar and Awali can be instantly warned. With luck we may get as much as half an hours warning of a raid: even a warning from Casoc headquarters would give us time to close down the Refinery and get our women into shelters. The S.N.O. and A.L.O. have asked for any such warning to be passed to them without delay. We would be glad of an expression of your opinion. Yours very truly, Sd/- R.A. Kennedy.

As regards the risk fiat.tne Oil Company might exert covert pressure on the Shaikh as as the case in the negotiations for the Unallotted Area, this also ppears somewhat unlikely since in that case there was the question t' a rival company entering the same field which would naturally beet trie Company much more quiokl$T than the present case.

Q. No ♦ D* 7447-N/^Q Will you please refer to correspondence ending with Prior’s telegram No. T*554, dated the 12th November 1940, dealing with the desire of the Bahrain Petroleum Oil Company and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to establish direct wireless communications between their offices in Bahrain and Dhahran respectively* One argument which might have irdtftied us to view the proposal of the Oil Companies with favour was that California Arabian Standard Oil Company were thinking of constructing a refinery at Has Tanura am for the time it is no aoubt true, as Prior points out in paragraph 4 of his telegram, that the recent Italian air raid has altered the position. Nevertheless we t'eel that there are certain other considerations which deserve careful study on a longer view before it is decided rigidly to support the monopoly claim of Cable and Wireless Limited. 2. It is presumably desirable on a long view to ao everything possible in an anaeavour to concentrate refinery installations in Bahrain. Developments suggest that the potential output of the fields in Saudi Arabia is much greater than that of the Bahrain field and, if the oil companies are to concentrate refining in Bahrain, they will no doubt require some auch^ inducement as is offered by an agreement to direct communica tion between Ba].ir^in and the mainland; by wireless. 3. Apart from- this, although Cable am tireless might hope to secure some additional revenue if this direct short- distance traffic were partly in their Lanas, one must remember that, even if they agree to the oil companies 1 proposal, it would not divert any existing traffic which they are handling and might indeed be expected to increase their traffic between Bahrain and the outside world. It is also conceivable that a completely negative attitude may result in their losing the monopoly position which they hold in respect of Daudi Arabia s communications with the outride world under the agreement of 1935, which is terminable after each five years. 4. Whan till is said, policy in such a matter would appear to fall to be determined largely by the attitude with which we regard the encry of American oil interests into the Persian Gulf, There seems to us much to be said for the view that the presence of American oil companies in the Gulf has strengthened the British position in those waters, and will do so even more if their main activities can -be concentrated in Bahrain, which is after all a veiled protectorate. The oil companies are a hostage to fortune and their interests lie in the maintenance of the status quo . I remember, for instancy in 1934/35 in connection with tbe Arms Traffic Convention, ^ the United States Government were induced to refrain from •' * making an embarrassing reservation regarding an Iranian claim to sovereignty over Persian G ulf waters, and there was some reason to believe at the time that their final attitude was mainly determined by the emergence of American oil interests in that area, 5.

Dear Terry The attached cables are generally self-explanatory* I shall not go into any detailed discussion of the points touched upon as I do not know whether anyone in Ban Francisco is trying to keep closely posted on this matter. If anyone is - and wants further information - please let me know. Briefly, the present plan is to come to the necessary agreement with the Cable Company covering both Bahrein and Arabia, and then, within whatever freedom this arrangement allows us, to deal with the Saudi Arabian Government and clear the matter with them# Practically speaking, our arrangements with the Cable Company will automatically include approval by the British Government and the Bahrein Government since our negotiations with the Cable Company are being conducted under the eye of The India Office. It is quite possible that in the end we shall have to exchange letters with both I IMG and the I Bahrein Government confirming these arrangements because our present rights touching the use of wireless are defined in our I Concession Agreement with the Shaikh and in our recent Political Agreement with HMG# As I understand the situation, you and Fred Davies and everyone else concerned in California are expectto work direct with Ballantyn© and, of course, with Bahrein towards reaching an agreement with the British Government, the Bahrein Government and the Cable Company - but not with the Gaucii Arabian Government - under which Bapco and Casoc will be permitted to communicate with each other under the best terms that can be arranged. I understand that I am to carry this on to the point where a definite proposal is ready for final approval - at which point it will be ref exuded to your company before any final action is taken# / An arrangement*0 2 An arrangement 'between Gasoc and the Saudi Arabian rovernment will stillremain to be negotiated - possibly .nvolving the Gable Company. I understand that all of this &gt;usines8 will be taken care of by Casoc* Presumably it will tave to be done, or at least the principles to be determined, &gt;efore we fully execute the other agreement. If there is any difference in opinion as to how this msines8 should be handled please let me know right away, feedless to say, I shall keep you currently posted on every itep I take, and shall refer all questions of importan€cto '■ou for your opinion.

Twitcheir*, After that, the nearer of the two speakers who was address- omeone named George, said he would now check over the list of ces and his interlocutor should let him know if he had received all. He then proceeded to read something which sounded like :traet from a ship’s manifest, begin ing at item No,3990 and nuing to beyond 4050, giving the names of such firms as:- Gadbury, Reckitt, Firestone, United Exporters, Dunlop, plan, Doulton, Applin &amp; Barrett, Heins:, Pyrene, Brooke B.ond, I Explosive, Nobel Chemical, Chiswick Polish, etc. Time did not permit me to stay till the end of the broad- ng to identify the station, but it occurs to me that part of message must yiave contained shipping information. The name Twitchell leads me to believe that the station robably in Saudi Arabia or the Yemen where Ur. Twitcheli, who present on leave in the U.S.A., is a moving spirit of many eering and mining enterprises including the Saudi Arabian g Syndicate.” Captain Foths adds that when on the Red Sea Coast some ago, he frequently picked up speech from a transmitter of the Arabian Mining Syndicate in Saudi Arabia.

The Casoc parties which have been working in the north and west of their concession have been recalled so there is now no possibility of getting early warning of the approach of aircraft from these directions. A warning emanating from A1 Khobar is believed to be useless, as it is thought that an aeroplane flying from there to Bahrein would arrive so soon after the warning as to render the warning valueless. For these reasons it is considered uneconomic to pay for the services of a 24 hour staff at the Casoc transmitting station and we have been informed that all transmissions from that station will cease between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. Will you please inform the Naval authorities that no air raid warnings will be sent from Casoc by wireless, so their offer to act as listeners is of no avail.No* C/2-10/15 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 2nd January £941 To The Chief Local Representative!

Sir, I have the honour to attac^ copies of a -p'W telegram which was handed to me this morning by Mr. P.W.Ohliger, of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. 2. Mr. Ohliger informed me that on a previous occasion a telegram which his Company regarded as being of extreme importance, had taken nearly a week to reach Sail Prancisco; and it was therefore hie intention that the master of the T.V. *B1 Segundo* (Panamanian registry) should send the present telegram as soon as she got to sea, i.e. in the course of that afternoon. 3. I asked Mr. Ohliger whether he had considered the possible consequences of infringing the monopoly of Gable and Wireless Limited, and also the inter national aspect of the situation. Mr. Ohliger replied that he knew that it had been agreed that / masters2 roasters of merchant shi x s In East Indian waters should not send roessages other than those orginating on board, and even instanced the Cairo Conference of 1933 on, apparently, this subject. He said, however, that he knew of many instances in which its provisions had been broken. 4. I told Mr. Ohliger that as he had decided to take this step, whatever the consequences, he roust understand that I could not give any kind of consent to his proposal, if that was his object in coming to see roe. He replied that he had merely coroe ft as a matter of co~ope ration*, in spite of the fact that the ship could easily have sent the message with nothing said to anyone. 5. After Mr. Ohliger* s departure, I telephoned Commander May, the Secretary to the Senior Kaval Officer; and conveyed to him the gist of this letter, as the Senior Naval Officer was not then ashore. 6.

He stated that the launch in question was one that had come out from Holland under its own power, and that it was perfectly entitled to use its wireless in any way it saw fit outside territorial waters. He added that the messages sent concerned only the Company 1 8 Internal affairs, that the Saudi Arabian Government were aware of the practice and had raised no objection and that the great delays imposed on their traffic by Cable and tireless Limited left them no alternative if they wished to receive reasonably early replies from their Head Office.

As the correspondence which he has sent to you discloses, e take objection to the practice adopted by the California Arabian tandard Oil Co. in Hasa of using a short wave wireless transmitter itted in one of their launches to communicate direct with the cited States of America. It is quite true that a ship on the high 2 as which is duly authorised to carry wireless by the country of 3g is try is entitled to work with any wireless station it pleases, at the practice of handing over telegrams from land, where there s an international system of communication^ to a ship or launch to 2 transmitted after it has gone beyond territorial waters, as we see t is irregular and contrary to the intention of the International agulations. We are not concerned to preserve Cable and Wireless ights in Saudi Arabia, but we are concerned to ensure that no cformation should be transmitted by wireless en clair or in an rdinary commercial code which might be of value to the eneny. robably 95% of the messages sent by the Oil Co. refer solely to eternal administrative details which are of no value whatsoever to lyone except themselves, but the odd 5% may convey information, Dssibly about the movement of tankers, which it is most important lat the eneny should not learn. • '• ■ - SZJQ j'.-'' . The refusal of the local officials of the Oil Co• to &gt;mply with the wishes expressed by the Political Agenti -Bahrain, i our behalf denotes a somewhat unexpected deterioration in their tandards of cooperation. Ashley, whom we asked to intervene, is a ilifornia Standard man and was extremely surprised to hear of the ttitude adopted by Dhahran. He himself offered to communicate with head office in the U.S.A. and stated the belief that if he did &gt; there would be little doubt that instructions would be issued to lahran to comply with our wishes. As however his expectation has &gt;t been fulfilled, we would now suggest that the matter be raised Lth the Company *s representative in London. We do not wish to be *avy-handed over this matter, though presumably it would be &gt;ssible to ask Ibn Baud to prohibit the use of wireless istallations in launches based on any port in Hasa in view of Cable id Wireless's rights in Arabia and the Oil Company's obvious itention of defeating those rights. Perhaps if you would be .lling to discuss with Ballantyne the matter could be settled lie ably enough.

Dear Zambra, I understand that Ballantyne now asks what security measures would be required if the Oil Companies should a-’ree with Cable and Wireless upon arrangements for wireless communication between the Oil Companies' representatives on Bahrein an I on the Arabian mainland. You were good enough to comment on this side of the pro Hem in your letter of the 20 th February Our views are as follows. r 2. The local authorities will consider it essential to have some form of control over communications between Bahrein and the mainland while the war lasts. ’This is S not necessarily from distrust of the Oil Companies, but because important information might be given away quite unwittingly. a. It seems that control can be arranged only by cohtinual listening in, and if such control is to be exercised effectively and conveniently it will oe necessary to require that - all“communications xrom Bahrein x ^ 'X U TiFl£i£l tlirOllich O Ceiltr&amp;l Zarnbra.

Sir Campbell Stuart’s understanding at our last meeting was that both these applications were suspended, but I shall be grateful if you will kindly confirm this so that there may be no mi sap rehension. At the same time. Sir Campbell Stuart would be glad if you would be Itind enough to state what wireless activities, if any, the two oil companies propose to maintain.

Dear Major Zambra, / r Thanlc you for your letter of the 22nd April, a copy of which I note you have sent on to Mr. Gibson. Did xqy suggestion come quite as it seems to have strud you from the first paragr ph of your letter under reply? I thought I had suggested that it might be much more satisfactory to the Government if my Companies suspended their applications during the war, thus short-circuiting the need to go into the quevstion of safeguards and also relieving the Authorities of ary need to trouble about the control of International communications between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. That is what I really meant. If ny suggestion were accepted, then I should put both the safeguards ashed for and my suggestion up to my Companies for instructions, urging acceptance of my recommendation. To reply to the quest!ons put^ (a) Yes, the original application was by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, and following the meeting which took place on the 12th November, 1940, the application then took the form of one from the Bahrein Petroleum Company limited to use its small portable wireless sets, both on land and sea, for communication with the Mainland. . * » * (b) Had we proceeded beyond the discussion of the safeguards required by Government, I was going still further to modify the application by making it a joint one on behalf of both of these Companies for the use of portable sets on land and sea. (c) Sir Campbell Stuart's understanding at our last meeting is quite correct in that this application (the exact form of which I did not go into then) should be suspended. In other words, as I put it to Sir Campbell Stuart, I thought it would be much better for all parties ooncerned if the whole matter were suspended until after the end of the War (d)/Imperial Communications Advisory Committee, L'lectra House, Victoria Embankment, London, A.C .£* 1st May, ID41. letter of tiie B5th April, I enclose a copy of a further letter to Baliantyne. Bear Gib With r« Yours sincerely, (3d.) arren Z ambra J.l. Gibson, Esq.1st May, 1941 Bear Mr* Ballantyne, I have now heard further from Sir Edward Wilshaw, who says that while he will be prepared to agree that all the applications of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and the Bahrein Petroleum Company should be suspended for the period of the war, he is not yet clear about the position* The point which apparently is not clear is that he underocards that the small portable sets have already been used for communication with the mainland, and he would therefore be glad if you could obtain some definite information of the wireless activities which the two oil companies would propose to undertake from now on. I think perhaps the point could be cleared up if you could give me an interpretation of the sixth paragraph in your letter of the 4th December to Mr. Gibson, in which you say 'I think confusion has arisen from the fact that Cable &amp; tireless Ltd* knew nothing of the power of these two Companies to use portable sets for the purposes of their local operations and that they were, in fact, using such sets n My interpretati Petroleum Company uses portable sets within the confines of Bahrein, and that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company uses portable sets on the mainland of Saudi Arabia, but that there was, and is at present, no communication by means of these portable setsbbtween Bahrein and Saudi Arabia* Sir Edward Wilshaw' apparently is not sure whether the phrase in your letter 6f the 24th April, 1941, para graph (d), in which you say that you imagine n that the two Companies would go on as hitherto, namely, confine themselves ! to wireless for local operations, each Company within itspwnsphere of influence ”, definitely means that’ there would be no suggestion of communicating by the portable wireless sets between Bahrein and Saudi Arabia. on of this was that p th 'lb 1 he Bahrein u0 P m KTK)U3Xi Ga TV;I';Y LI-ITISD, 11, Jirc -in Lane, London, E*G*3. intorpretatl^, ie the correct one. tLe California :'xabian taxid^cd^ Gil^Cu-pa-ny an office at Ltciraan, at o - = possible ‘to receive ■ freru the uinl&amp;nd (I believe tLcy wore, _ in fact, received), but it mr not poxmtted to tlioia to tr^ns:.-it rvacsages by way of reply or otherwise to tuo iv,ai.ul-eid» I should not think that w iii@mational !J wireless ccf-iiwic utio.n being indulged is. si the oresent tiu© and, inost certaiiily, if my suggestion as to suspension were accented by all parties concerned, it would follow tael chore would be no ;i tornetiorul wireless coisausiicntions excepting tiirougn the medium of Cable and ireless Limited.

C. • : Dear Sir Cajpbell Stuart, ^ Tha;ik you for your letter of yesterday's date regarding the Oil Companies* proposals as regards comnunication to and from Bahrain* I am afraid I have serious doubts auout the good faith of such Companies* attitude. At every stage of the protracted negotiations ever since 1938 a different proposal has e erged and I cannot avoid coning to the conclusion that this is deliberate for the purpose of circumventing idiat to understand to be our co unieatioii rights^ in Bahrain. A perusal of the various letters I have exchanged on the' subject mth ou will corrooorate the above. I do not see any need for any apparatus to be located at the Oil Company*s office at Awali* Ae have alj that is required ior International co? onmication at Bahrain, unless this nebulous proposal now made refers to radiotelephony&gt; which to have been informed not recjuired now. ^ „. v 4 further: tore; you ini'on ed me in you' letter of 9th April that the local authorities consider it essential to have sow 0 control over communications between Bahrain an the_random '.hile the war lasts. This, I thin:, - lakes it all the tore desxraule apparatus shfeuld be in our office and that no api^aratus be allege, i the island, other than under our control, which 10 capaole of coi iiaunicating with outside points. I am some^t-concerned over this business. I told you in my letter of 25thlarch last of the 3 tatet«nt rnde^r on# of the Bahrain Petroleum Company 1 s employees to one of om ' , aj munication Persian Gulf of the use of one of their Adit™l with America direct. «««*^ whichtus iraparted by the inforuiation has come to hand, xni oration same er^ployee: -To overcone local restrictions tte J^fit out launch.

They have a lot of -work apparently and the launch goes out for some hours every day or at least every other day. They employ three commercial wireless operators,” This may be some boastinr; statement of the employee in question as we have not yet been able to intercept any such illicit transmissions. On the other hand, Bahrain is ver busy and ray not have had the opportunity of listening in at the psychological i ament. • \ In any case, I have nothing to add to ny previous statements, i.e, that international con lunications should be carried through our intermediary, whether with the mainland or elsewhere. » ^■'5 C V,e made, as you are aware from the copy of our letter to Ilr. Ballantyne of 19th Decei her 1940, certain compromise proposals to which we have not received a reply. In view, however, of the statement in your letter of 9th April to which I refer above, this compromise could not operate .during the period of the war. Yours' sincerely.

The delay between 9th April and 29th Kay was due to the fact that, when the sugaestion of suspension ms put us to .able and Wireless Limited, a correspondence ensued with BallantyiK in ^ -* clear up certain points raised by Cable and ircleas Lim - ■■ ■■ exactly what applications it was proposed to suspend, ana ; « wireless Ihivifes the oil companies intended to continue during the war.

(3) The schem for the diversion of theJ»rslan ^ J vm - ore discussing last week on the I.C.C. mil enhance tiie -^e of iratoein as a conunications centre, and xr, v-ou therefore appear all the more advisable &lt;to exercise the fud possible control over the wireless activities of i.he oil companies. -IT VOU ai&gt;ree with these points it hardly seems necessary to have .Ji Sir Caeobell Stuart could write to Ballantyne statin ihat^it is the view of the Government that all 'international comuvac 2S pass though an installation located in the offices of Cable and YLreless* ! irdted, and that if the oil capanies wish after all to proceed with their applications they must negotiate with Cable and tireless Limited on that basis.

CQIJUMICATIONS A visit was made to the haval Base by Bes Snyder and L. Deane this date, and the information requested by the Senior Maval Officer,Persian Gulfwas handed to Commander King and his W/T expert,who was called in. The information presented is attached. It was the wireless rating's opinion that the frequencies that we proposed to use would not interfere with any of the frequencies now regularly used by themselves or the R*A*F., who have just recently established wireless facilities at Bahrain. The only possible conflict that he mentioned was our frequency 328? K.C, They had recently experimented with a frequency of 3285 K.C .which would conflict with this,but he said this experimental frequency did not work out very satisfactorily and he was satisfied that it could be dropped. Me pointed out that 3287 K.C. was an import ant frequency for us because of the number of crystals we have on hand for operation on this frequency. After this, Commander King was told the following (1) - that communications would be required 24 hours per day. (2) - that the requirement for the communication was based on the oil barging between ninja and Zellaq,which would be increased for purposes of helping the war effort, to a almost double the present capacity. (3) - that it is required as a safety precaution in handling personal between the two siaes, and (4) - for notification in cases of enemy action in Arabia. It was further stated that only staff personnel would have access to our sending and receiving equipment and that would be limited to a selected few staff personnel in the Arabian organisa tion, and as far as Bahrain was concernea to men in the Secretarial staff of the Management. V/e further stated that we would at all times be co-operative with them in changing any wave length on which conflict might develop. We strongly stressed the necessity for reasonably quick approval for this service to be commenced.1.

It was recognised that where the telegragh rates were high senders could effect some saving by handing thsr messages to ships’ ersonnel for transmission after the ship had sailed. The Postmaster General had sr viously written to the principal companies operating wireless installations in ships registered in the united Kingdom pointing out that the practice was irregular and requesting them to issue suitable instructions to operators on ships under their control so as to prevent any organised service of the kind. Regulations (1932) were in force and while the practice was clearly contrary to the spirit of the reforwarding provisions contained in Article 31 of those Regulations, there was nothing in the Regulations which enabled a really effective control to be ©xerci.se&amp;. At the Cairo Radio communication Conference of 133*8 the matter was raised by other Administrations and the views of the Conference are expressed in the n VGue n reproduced at page 21 / ox the Xitoxxiational Radio communication Regulations 1933» Tuis voue recommends, inter-alia, that Administrations do all At that time the Madrid Telegraph / they H.
