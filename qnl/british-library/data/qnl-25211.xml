Having secured guarantees re quired in Tehran which you find adequate, it now remains to present to Persian government, as desiderata of government of India to be taken into account during conference at Bushire, suggestions made at the end of paragraph 1 and in paragraph 2 of Foreign Office tele gram No. 114. I consulted Sir A. Wilson personally as regards paragraph 3 of that telegram who considers preferable that he should himself if possible attend conference as representative of general British commercial in terests in the south and not Anglo-Persian Oil Company particularly. I concur in this view. I think that there will be far less difficulty in securing arrangements satisfactory/ to government of India through local negotiations at Bushire than by demanding any further binding guarantees of Central government- 2 - government owing to unfavourable a too sphere at Tehran. I therefore propose to make a communication to Persian government in the sense outlined in above adding that you will let me know in due course at what date Bushire conference will suit you.

Your Highness, By rny note of March 17th I had the honour of informing His Excellency Hakira-ul-Hulk, Minister for joieign .ci^iairs, ^uat His *.*aj 3Sty ? s Governiiient had been punctually ano. ^ully informed of the desires expressed by the Persian Government in regard to the Southern Post Offices and of their proposals for dealing /ith that question: I further observed that, having regard to the necessity of consulting several different and widely separated administrations, an immediate decision could not oe expected, out that everything possible v/as being done to secure one at an early moment. I am glad to say that the exchange of views on these complicated matters had been con cluded and that I am now in a position to acquaint Your Highness . T itn the attitude of His -.iajestj, r T s Government. As Your Highness is well aware the Post Offices in the Gulf Ports hitherto worked by the Indian Postal Adminis tration have the sanction of time to justify their operation, some indeed having bien in existence for over fifty years. They were the pioneers of the postal service in Persia, they have maintained the services entrusted to them at a high level of efficiency, at no cost to the Persian Govern ment or taxpayer but at a loss to the Indian Administration, vhile the sea-borne mails to and from Persia have been carried m British Shipping free of all charge to the Persian community. Your Highness and every reasonable man will comprehend from these Highness Hushir-ed-Dowlah, President of the Council of Ministers.© these few leading facts that these post offices have rendered an inestimable service to Persia, to her inhabitants and to her trade, as well as to the foreign residents on her soil. This being the case Your Highness will readily realize the dee anxiety felt by His Majesty’s Government that whatever postal adminivStration replaces the existing one should provide adequate and durable guarantees that the services hitherto rendered shall continue to be performed in the future with the same punctuality, the same regularity and the same efficiency as heretofore. ere such anxiety a purely British concern I should not bring it to your notice so prominently, but I do so because the matter is one which closely and vitally affects the daily needs of Persia and of each one of her inhabitants, whether official, private or engaged in commerce or industry: for it is a ' eli-mnown and universally accepted fact that a good postal service is an indispensable element in the progress of any nation, and that an inferior one is a very grave hindrance to its proper development. I have therefore been directed to inform the Imperial Persian Government that Hir llajesty’s Government agree in principle to the abolition or transfer to the Imperial Postal administration of the Post Offices in question, provided that the Persian Government will give me an assurance that it is their settled purpose to maintain, under the supervision of an European or American Director General of Posts, a postal servica equally efficient and comprehensive as^that hitherto provided by the British Inc-ian Offices. I trust that Your Highness, fully appreciating the friendly consideration which has prompted the decision of His Ilajesty's Government now communicated and their earnest desire to ensure, in the best interests...inter 3Sts of ?or r ia herself, continuity and permanency in the Persian Postal service in the chanced circumstances, /ill he willing to give me in the name of the Imperial Persian Government, the required urence, in 'hich case I aft authorised to arrange with the Imperial Government for the assembly of a joint commission of experts at Pushire, representative of the Persian, Indian and T Irap Postal Administrations, to discuss and settle the procedure to he followed for the surrender of the post offices, and also to acquaint you with certain matters of detail in connection with this procedure to which the Government of India wish me to draw your special attention. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration. (Signed) Percy Loraine.DRAFT TELEGRAM. SECRETARY OF STATE ks. TO VICEKOY, FOLiEIGN DEPARTMENT.

Your telegram No. 1004-S., of 2nd July. As regards Post Offices at AJiwaz and oil fields I concur in their transfer to Indian system. As regards combined Postal and Telegraph Offices at Mohammerah and Abadan, except difficulty of separation there is no objection in principle to transfer of postal work to Indian Post Office. On the other hand the two offices were established during war by Indian Expeditionary Force “ D ” telegraphs from Basrah as part of Mesopotamian system. Persian telegraphs have no cognizance of them and Indo-European nothing to do with them. They are a very convenient and useful asset to Anglo Persian Oil Company and to British Commercial interests in general especially as between them and Mesopotamian offices inland rates are in force. Moreover it is of strategi cal importance Abadan should be in safe telegraph touch with Basrah. If action is taken which will call attention to these offices result will be that we shall either have to do away with them altogether or hand them over to Indo- European or Persian Telegraphs conditionally without which case of inland rates will no longer be possible. Obviously simple course is to leave present arrangement undisturbed except that if desired we could run postal side of offices for Govern ment of India furnish accounts to them and cut them out of Mesopotamian budget.(47) Telegram R., No. 911-S., dated the 29th (received the 30th) July 1921.

Postal Department of Persian Government are now pressing for Ahwaz and Oil Fields Post Offices to be returned to them claiming that these offices are not re quired any longer for war purposes. From my point of view this claim is incontes table and unless India assumes control I fear I shall have to hand them back. Please telegraph your wishes urgently. This is with reference to your telegram 2169-S. of the 10th September. (50) Telegram P., No. 1556, dated the 15th (received the 16th) September 1921. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. (Repeated Baghdad.) It seems highly desirable that the two offices at Ahwaz (and ?) Oil Fields at least should be taken over by India as Persia has not so far as I am aware any interna tional money order system, and money orders are chief source of business. Also if Indian Post Office were to take over these offices it would be possible to intro- * duce V.-P. P. service which is very popular. A. jrropos V.-P. P. I am informed that the loss of it is very much felt by people of Mohammerah. I think they and Abadan also would welcome reintroduction of Indian Post Office but unless practice of separate post and telegraph offices is reverted to, the telegraph difficulty appears insuperable. This is with reference to your telegram 2169-S., and High Commissioner’s telegram 1002-S.mmmm (51) Telegram P., No. 1623, dated the 1st (received the 2nd) October 1921. From— The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. a ip+tpr has been received from Anglo-Persian Oil Company conveying a very strong protest against idea of British Post Offices Ahwaz and Oil Fields being closed or hailed over to Persian Postal Department. Ground of Potest is that it the oresent regular and safe postal mail service is discontinued and \ ,-P. P., Savings piik and S Money Order facilities totally stopped after these have been enjoyed fortx years arihwaz and at Fields great hardship will be inflicted on the Com- nanv’s Employees (some hundred British and 500 Indians at former and 200 British and 3 000 Indians at latter) and serious discontent will be caused. Money Order and V-P P. business in past was very Considerable. In addition Company state that mails are carried by them to Ahwaz without profit and to Oil Fields entirely at their own expense while at latter place the post office is housed in one of their bungalows and staffed by one of their clerks. Company add that they cannot allow Persian Post Office to be opened on their land at Oil Fields. Copy of the letter is being sent to you to-day by mail. , Other British and British Indian subjects at Ahwaz would suffer. I earnestly hope that, in the circumstances, Government of India will see its way to take over offices concerned. . „ ^ , This is with reference to my telegram 1556 of the 15th September.

F Subject.— Post Offices at Ahwaz and the Oil Fields. With reference to my telegram of the 15th September 1921, I have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India copv of a letter da tori the 25th September 192! from the Anglo-Fersian Oil Company togatolmg the dtua ' bihty of the Post Offices at Ahwaz and the Oil Fields being tlken over bv the Indian Post Office, and their refusal to permit the maintenance of a Persian Post Office on the Company s property at the Oil Fields. 2. It seems to me that there are only two possible courses to pursue : one is for the Indian Post Office to take over the two existing Mesopotamian offices at Ahwaz and the Oil Fields, and the other is to close them down entirely. 3 The reasons adduced by the Company for following the first course and transferring these two post offices to the Indian system are in my opinion verv cogent indeed and it certainly would be a very great hardship to the employees of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and other Britisji firms, and all British and British Indian residents, who are now so numerous at these places, if thev were to lose the advantages derived from V.-P. P., Savings Banks, and Money Order faci- htms, which are not provided by the Persian Post Office. In addition the loss of these facilities would undoubtedly cause serious dissatisfaction with local conditions among the Indian employees of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and other firms with consequent damage to British interests. 1 ^ ^ 4 The Money Order business through the Offices at Ahwaz and the Oil Field* is so heavy, amountmg according to the figures given bv the Com no™ ok Z Rs. 30,000 per mensem that thesl Offices ^..ull^Ls^ se.SuTportmg ff no an appreciable source of revenue to the Indian Post Office. 8 5. If the Indian Post Office, however, cannot take over these offices there seems to be no alternative but to follow the second course proposed above Them is already a Persian Post Office in existence at Ahwaz, so it will not be necessarw OBfieW r nffl T PO nr ian 0fi ? ce t0 L the Persian PostaI Department. As regS the Oilfields Office it will be seen that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company do not to ahow the opening of a Persian Post Office on their land at and surrounding the Oilfields and I think their pounds for this attitude are reasonable. The unde iZ ability from the Company s and indeed from a political point of view of having fn' mifn r , rUptandl f? g ^ ngsubordinate P ™ postal officials preSa! the Oilfields is obivous, and I think the Company are right in refusing toll W fb! opening of a Persian Post Office on their property/ ^ * ng to allow the 6.

In reply to your telegram* No. 1563 (confirmation copy attached) I have the *Not received. honour to offer the following observations :— f- 1. As regards Maidan-i-Naftan. Under no circumstances could the Anglo- Persian Oil Company agree to the transfer to the Persian Post Office of the present Indian Post Office. The Company have, as explained in previous years, the strong est objection on political and general grounds to the existence on the Maidan-i- Naftan Oil Field, their private property, of subordinate Persian officials, and there is every reason to believe that their objections would be shared to the full by the Bakhtiari Khans. 2. As regards Ahwaz, there can scarcely be any question of handing over the existing Indian Post Office to the Persian Post Office. The building is rented temporarily ; the staff would not remain, and the Persian Government’s Post Office could not, in the absence of an agreement with the Indian Post Office, take over the most important part of the work from the point of view of this Company, viz., V.-P. P., S. B., and M. 0. work. 3. The question at issue therefore appears to be whether or not the Indian Post Offices at Maidan-i-Naftan and Ahwaz can be closed without grave detriment to the interests of this Company. 4. On this subject I beg to submit the following remarks (a) The staff of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Maidan-i-Naftan consists of about 200 British and 3,000 British Indian subjects and this number is constantly increasing. I believe that this is a larger number than is served by any two Indian Post Offices in the Gulf. (b) The number of Anglo-Persian Oil Company employees at Ahwaz is about 100 and some 500 British Indian subjects. To this must be added the British and British Indian community not members of the staff of this Company : this again is a considerably greater number than is served by any Gulf Office except Mohammerah and Bushire. (c) For six years at Ahwaz and for four years at the Fields these communi ties have enjoyed the advantages of immunity from delayed letters and thefts and of a definite Postal address : of a regular Mail service, both parcel and letter, V.-P. P., S. B., and M. O. facilities. In this connection it will be remembered that the Persian Post Office have no facilities for handling parcels above Mohammerah and no Parcel post agreement with foreign Ports, nor any 4 M. 0., S. B., or \. P. P. service. (d) The figures of M. 0. business through these two Post Offices are not available at the moment but I understand that they jointly amount to something like Rs. 30,000 a month— sometimes much more. These Post Offices would therefore presumably be a source of profit to the Government of India if taken over. ie) I understand that the Government of India had actuall} agreed to start a Post Office at Ahwaz before the War and only technical difficulties prevented its establishment in 1913 or 1914. (f) The Persian Post Office used to send their Mails by runner to Ahwaz, and still do so : the Indian Post Office Mails could not be carried thus, but it is not likely that for a long time to come the Persian Post Office could be induced to initiate proper arrangements. (q) The main reason, apart from the inefficiency of the Central Government, why the Persian Post Offices in the Gulf have always been bad is that it has been impossible to induce educated and competent Persians from Central Persia to make their homes in the Gulf. This difficulty is as great now as ever.5. If these Post Offices are abolished, the effect on the British, Canadian, and Indian employees of the Company will be serious ; discontent with local conditions, which the Company has been making most earnest efforts to allay, will increase : Indian employees in particular will be chronically in difficulties and anxieties, and it can scarcely be doubted that the abolition of the Post Office would be keenly resented by them as severing their only certain link with India. 6. Moreover the abolition of these Post Offices would only be the prelude for a demand for the abolition of the Abadan Post Office, which would be equally objectionable to the Company. This Post Office serves 70 Europeans and 5,000 Indians. 7. The recent discontinuance of S. B. and V.-P. P. work by Post Offices dependent on Mesopotamia has caused great inconvenience to British and British Indian employees : if the Post Offices under consideration were transferred to the control of India these much desired facilities would no doubt be granted afresh. They are particularly needed in Arabistan, where few European or Indian neces saries can be locally purchased. 8. As to whether in the event of abolition the Company could “ run a bundo- bast of its own ” I have little doubt that the Company would be compelled to initiate a Postal service of its own, auxiliary to Mohammerah, borrowing if need be competent Postal officials for the purpose, but my Directors would. I feel sure, be most reluctant to adopt this step, which would weaken the position of Indian Post Offices at Mohammerah and Abadan and could scarcely fail to create trouble with the Central Government. 9. I venture to conclude by pointing out that from Mohammerah to Ahwaz the Mails are carried by the Company’s Agents under a contract with the Mesopotamian Post Office which is certainly not a source of profit to us and is likely shortly to be run at a loss. From Ahwaz to Maidan-i-Naftan the Mails are carried at the sole cost of the Company. At Maidan-i-Naftan the Post Office occupies a building belonging to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and is staffed by a clerk supplied by the Company, the Post Office paying him nothing in spite of the very considerable business which is being done through the Office.

In this connection I beg to forward for their information a copy of he marginally noted letters which have passed on the subject. It will be seen that the letter of His Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz, describes an interview with His Excellency the Governor General of Arabistan at which the question of the post offices was raised and encloses a letter from the Karguzar of Arabistan protesting against the retention of the British post offices at Abadan, and the Fields, and against the retention ol the Mesopotamia telegraph office in Mohammerah Consulate. In his letter Captain Peel inclines to the view that in the long run it would be better not to adopt a non-possumus attitude in regard to the post offices, but to hand over the offices at Ahwaz and the Oil Fields to the Persian Government.On the other hand the Anglo-'Persian Oil Company continue to press that the offices should be maintained and taken over by the Government of India. In my letter No. 242-S., dated 30th September, I submitted the views of the 'Anglo-1 ersian Oil Company and the reasons why they desired the Government of India to lake charge of these offices in detail, and the second enclosure to this letter shows another reason why the change is desired—wz., the extraordinary delays in the money order service between the Mesopotamia post offices and India. The great advantages of the Indian system to Anglo-Persian Oil Company employees and other British subjects are the value-payable parcels and the money order systems and parcel post. If the Indian Post Office were to take over the offices in Arabistan these could be run efficiently. On the other hand if the offices are closed the Persian Post Office has no parcel post convention and no value-payable parcel post system, while the money order system is by no means efficient. In the circumstances T think it would be advisable ii possible to get the 1 ersian Government to agree to the retention of these offices until the Persian post offices oan provide an efficient Foreign Parcel Post and Foreign Money Order system, as to close the offices would cause great inconvenience to British subjects, especially the Indians employed by the Anglo-Persian.Oil Company. In the meanwhile in order to secure the advantages of the value-payable parcel post system and greater expedition in money order business, and also because the greater pait of the busi ness of these post office is with India, I would urge that the post offices should be taken over bv the Indian Post Office again. 1 he post office at Mohammerah itself is on a different footing from the offices at Abadan, Ahwaz, and the Jil Fields, having been opened when the \ ice-Consulate was started at Mohammerah in 1891 bv permission of the Persian Government. M hatever happens m regard to the three other offices, the post office at Mohammerah should not, in my opinion, be closed or handed over to the Persians unless and until all the Indian post offfi;es in the Gulf are closed or handed over. I strongly recommend that this post office be taken over at once by the Indian Post Office ; the reason it was not taken over some months ago was that it was a combined post and telegraph office, but I under stand that this reason no longer exists, the telegraph and post offices having been separated again from 1st December 1921. In the circumstances I hope that the Mohammerah post office will be handed to the Indian Post Office as soon as possible. To sum up I beg to recommend— (1) that the Mohammerah post office be retained in any case and taken over by the Indian Post Office; (2) that we should endeavour to get the Persian Government to agree to the retention of the British Post Offices at Abadan, Ahwaz, and the Oil Fields until such time as the Persian Post Office can provide effi cient Foreign Parcel and Money Order services, on the ground that the interests of a large number of British subjects would he adversely affected if they were closed. If necessary we could endeavour to restrict their business to British subjects and the employees of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In the meanwhile these offices should be taken over by the Indian Post Office ; this will only affect A ha dan and Ahwaz as the office at the Oil hields is entirely staffed and lun by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. A copv of this letter is being sent to His Excellency the High Commissioner, Baghdad, His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, and the Consuls at Ahwaz and Moham- merah. Enclosure.

With reference to the correspondence ending with Captain Wallis * telegram No. 591, dated 2&lt;5th September 1921, on tSIot received. subject of the British Post Offices at fhwaz and the Oil Fields, I beg to enclose a translation of a lei ter which I have now eceived from the Karguzar of Arabistan on the same subject.10 It will be seen that the Karguzar refers to post offices establishedjiuring the war, which would include Ahwaz, the Od f p e ^^; t W az wa” the Persian °and Indian Governments, the former Government naturally regards it as a war-time institution. . - A T • + . ori . In conversation with the Karguzar and the new Governor-General of Arabistan I a+atprl that the Question of the Arabistan post offices could not be considered apar address ' His Excellency agreed that the case of British post offices m Arabistan SXn 8 “.;.nfc [ „v other part of the n ent could not reasonably demand the closing down of British post omces Arabistan until it was prepared to make adequate Ak ad fed th hi of narcels and letter mails between Mohammerah and Ahwaz. He added tnar was sure ht Government could and would make adequate arrangements and that it would be prepared if necessary to enter into a contract wit h Messrs, .tuck. an7coinpanv for the use of a postal launch on the lines of the contract made between that Company and the Mesopotamian Government during the war. To mv Query as to whether the pressure now being applied by the lersia Governmentwas^due to political or financial reasons His E^eUency Zahir-vd- Mnlk stated that he thought the reasons were mainly financial. As an instance of tL W in which the British postal and telegraph offices in Arabistan were j ‘ 4 -^ flip intprosts of the Persian Government he cited the case of tho tXMe g le‘b?h office if MlLmmerah to which merchants in Mohammerah take „ nv fplecri'nins addressed to Baghdad and Basrah m preference to the 1 ersian. teleeraphOffice wherfthe rates Ire higher. He put the. loss to the Persian Gov- ernment &lt;on this head at Tomans 10,000 a year, but the Karguzar has now estimated it at Tomans 5,000 a month, which seems an absurd figure. In these circumstances I shall be glad to know what reply I should commu- nicate officially to th^ Karguzar. Provided that the Persian Government guarantees to make adequate arrai^e- ments for the handling of parcel and letter mails between Mohammerah and Ahwaz I am inclined to think that on a long view it would be a mistake for us to adopt a nonvossumus attitude so far as the post offices at Ahwaz and the Oil Fields are concerned since the existence of these post offices (and more especially the post office at Ahwaz) lends colour to the constant complaints of British interference Arabistan. . , , The post office here has hitherto not been so efficiently conducted that any great loss P will be felt locally if it is abolished. At the present time there are no f - iUties for Saving Bank or Value-Payable Parcel Post business Facilities for monev order remittances to India are of course essential for the \AoiiTf dfte of the Oil Company, and should the post offices at Ahwaz and the On Fiel . closed down altogether, the Company would be compelled to provide facilities for sir ill remittances to India either through Messrs. Shaw Wallace and Company in Bombay or through the British Post Office at Mohammerah. Moreover to J ud ge from the correspondence which preceded the establishment ol the post office a Ahwaz it might be difficult to induce the Indian Postal Department to open up on a scale which would really meet the present needs of the Company s larg staff in this district. ^ 1 , Owing to my increased establishment I can no longer offer to house the post office in the Consulate buildings.

In accordance with instructions which I have received and in continuation of our previous conversation I have the honour to address you on the subject of the removal of the post offices which were established in Arabistan by the respresenta- tives of the British Government during the world-war. It will be admitted that the aforesaid post offices were established as a tem porary measure only during the world-war, that the war has since terminated, and that the establishment of these post offices in Persian territory besides being contrary to the postal agreements in force between the two Government has involved and does still involve exceptional loss to the Persian Government. In these circumstances in order to preserve the integrity of the treaties and agreements between the two Governments and in order to obviate the exceptional loss in which the Government is involved, I would request you to be good enougn to take the necessary steps forthwith to abolish the temporary offices as soon as possible in order that a return may be made to the pre-war basis in respect ot mails and other postal transactions and that the regulations of the Persian (Postal) Department in Arabistan may be observed. Finally I would draw your attention to the case of the telegraph offices which fall in the same category of war-time institutions. Their removal was lately agreed on and carried into effect, but one of them still exists in Mohammerah and accepts and transmits Foreign messages from the inhabitants, thereby causing a loss ot more than 5,000 tomans monthly to the Government. I would request 7 011 the ^' fore to take early steps for the removal of the said telegraph office so that the te - graphs may be restored to their former condition and no further loss from these • two sources be caused to the Persian Government. I rely confident y on your good nature to take early steps to settle these two questions and to inform me ot the result.

I have the honour to forward herewith two copies of a letter received from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company regarding the administration of ^ at Maidan-i-Naftan, Ahwaz, Mohammerah, and Abadan. I may add that the Acting Consul at Mohammerah mentioned the matter to me independently, when I was at Mohammerah recently, saying that money orders from Mohammerah often take as much as five weeks to reach India. The present delay between the payment of money into the Post Offices in Arabistan and its payment in India is a very real hardship on the Indian employees of the Company, and bv creating discontent amongst them will but lead to labour difficulties I earnestly trust theiefore that Your Excellency will see your way to move the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Baghdad, to remove this grievance.

The Fields Manager attributes the steady decrease in Money Order receipts to the increasing delay amounting to five weeks over the payment of money into the Post Office on a Money Order and its payment in India. The writer is of the opinion that the same applies to all Arabistan Offices. When worked by the Government of India payment was ensured within a fortnight. The Fields Manager also reports that an adequate supply of Money Order lorms was not sent to the Fields in November, increasing the difficulties of remitters. We enclose spare copies of this letter for transmission to His Excellency the High Commissioner and the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Baghdad, if you see no objection. Maidan-i-Naftan .. Ahwaz ..

Certain of the offices (notably at Bunder Abbas, Bushire, Lingah) are of 50 years standing or more, and were set up as necessary adjuncts to the Consular establishments when first located at these places, i.e. long before Persia joined the Postal Union. Others (e.g. at Abadan) were established shortly before the war, as the extension of British interests required; these can hardly be defended on the score of prescriptive right and their origin is later than Persia*s enury into the Postal Union. Others again, in the interior of Arabistan, were an outcome of military operations between 1915 and 1918 and as they are now administered by Iraq (not India) as the successor of the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Porce, they are particularly obnoxious to Persian sentiment. On the broad issue that the Offices, whatever their age, are now an anomaly and an infringement of Persia’s sovereign rights all parties concerned are more or less agreed, the Government of India with reluctance. On the question that they are of value to the public all parties are likewise agreed. The negotiations proceeding between His Majesty’s Minister and the Persian Government and the consequential correspondence between this Office, the Foreign Office, the Government of India, the Legation at Tehran and the High Conmissioner Baghdad, are on the assumption that the Offices are to be surrenderedsurrendered or transferred to Persia; the question is how this is to be done without courting inefficiency and ^n'|niry to 0 ^ the public’s interests* Provided that the Persian Postal Administration continues to be supervised by Iluropean (or American) experts the question becomes one of arrangement of matters of detail / to be discussed by postal experts. But the recent dismissal of the Belgian Director General (LLl^olitor) renders it desirable at this juncture to secure guarantees of an efficient and adequately supervised Persian postal service (capable of discharging all the functions performed by the British Indian offices), before tne surrender actually takes place* It is quite certain that Persia unaided will not be competent to give an efficient service, and the Resolution taken at Washington 7 over the analogous question of foreign Post Offices in China affords a / useful lever for enforcing our demand for guarantees from Persia.any further communication ,his subject, please quote t ' &gt; -. r 13.36/36^1^ and^iddress, r '4 n % not to any person by name, ^ hut to- 1 260 !

His Majesty»s Minister at Peking has been instructed to report in detail on the steps to be taken to abolish the British postal agencies in China in accordance with this resolution. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, 9he Under secretary of state, India Office.F Vt 6/36/10) Enclosure V* 1260 ^ REGARDING FOREIGN POSTAL AGENCIES IN CHINA * A* Recognising the justice of the desire expressed by tlie Chinese Government to secure the abolition of foreign postal agencies in China, save or except in leased territories or as otherwise specially provided by Treaty, it is resolved: (1) The four powers, having such postal agencies, agree to their abandonment, subject to the following conditions: (a) That an efficient Chinese postal service is maintained: (b) That an assurance is given by the Chinese Government that they contemplate no change in the present postal administration so far as the status of the foreign co-director general is concerned* (2) To enable China and the Powers concerned to make the necessary dispositions, this arrangement shall come into force and effect not later than January 1st, 1923. agencies the four powers concerned severally undertake to afford full facilities to the Chinese customs authorities to examine in those agencies all postal matter (excepting ordinary letters whether registered or not, which upon external examination appear plainly to contain only written matter) passing through them, with a view to ascertaining whether they contain articles which are dutiable or contra band, or which otherwise contravene the customs regulations or laws of China* Dear Sir: With regard to the proposed abolition of foreign postal agencies I am happy to inform you that my Government have no objection to the initiation of the arrangement as from the date in the draft resolution; that is, not later than January 1st 1923. In announcing this agreement of ray Government, I B* Pending the complete withdrawal of foreign postal Senator Lodge read the following letter: Japanese Delegation, Washington. December 9th 1921.am instructed to state before the Committee the ip desire concerning the maintenance of efficient * V! Chinese postal service substantially to the following effect: Taking into account the fact that the proposed change in the postal regime in China cannot fail practically to affect the Japanese to a much greater extent than any other nationals, the Japanese Government wish to place on record their desire that a suitable nomber of experienced Japanese postal officers be engaged by China in the interests of the efficiency of the Chinese postal administration. The reasonableness of this desire will readily be appreciated,when it is considered that the towers concerned have recognised the need of effective foreign assistance in the uhinese postal administration, and that no less than 70 British subjects and 20 Frenchmen are in that service, while only 2 Japanese experts are employed in it. Yours respectfully, (Signed) M. Eanihara. Honble. Henry Cabot Lodge, Chairman, Sub-committee for Foreign Post Offices in China. Mr. Sze made the following statement: ”Since the establishment of her national postal service, China has at all times handled with efficiency all foreign mail. She appreciates that, with the withdrawal of foreign post-offices from her soil, the amount of foreign mail to be handled by her own postal system will be increased. This increase she undertakes to handle with the same efficiency by making such additions to the personnel and equipment of her postal service as will be required. As soon as the Siberian route is reopened for the transportation of foreign mail matter between Asia and Europe, steps will be taken to make arrangements for the transportation of such mail matter as was formerly transported by this route, as regards actual railway transportation of such mail China will hold herself responsible for uninterrupted service upon those railways or sections or railways within her jurisdiction which are under her own control and operation.V USD DRAFT TELEGRAM.

V... _ T *■— J I am directed by the Postmaster General to acknowledge the receipt of your further letter of the 25th of last month transmitting a copy of previous correspondence regarding the British Indian Post Offices on Persian Territory. If it is decided to withdraw the Agencies for administrative reasons or on general political grounds, the Postmaster General is of course not concerned; hut he may perhaps be permitted to remark that undue weight appears to have been given in the India Office letter of the 12th of January and the draft telegram which accompanied it to the circumstance that a specific mention of the Agencies was omitted from Article XLIV (now XLIII) of the Detailed Regulations to the Postal Union Convention. As the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is aware, the Postal Union Congress has always held that it is outside its competence to deal with the question of the legality of Agencies of one Country in the territory of another. The Turkish declarations regard ing the foreign Agencies in Turkey will be remembered as cases in point. The Postal Union Congress at Madrid was no exception in this respect. The declaration made by the Persian delegate, in which he attempted to attach a political significance to the new drafting of the Article XLIV, was received without comment. and/ The Under Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICE.- 2 and cannot be considered as more than an ex parte statement. In the Postmaster General’s view the inter pretation put by the Persian delegate on the new text of the Article in question is untenable. The reasons for the alteration are stated in the documents of the Congress, It was made on a French proposal the object of which was merely to simplify the text by excluding the enumeration of the various Agencies maintained by Union Countries.(which was considered unnecessary and out of place) and by in cluding a specific statement that such Agencies in Non-Union Countries formed part of the Union, a point * on which there might be doubt. The list of Agencies was in any case incomplete; and, as it was constantly requiring revision it was convenient to omit it. No reference to any political reason was made in the printed ’motif* of the French proposal, which was adopted without discussion simply as an improvement in drafting. The Congress had certainly no intention of implying that, in its opinion, Agencies in Union Countries had ceased to be legal. It need only be stated that such Agencies are still included as belong ing to the Union in the documents which are issued by the International Bureau of the Postal Union giving particulars of postal rates and other details of the postal service throughout the Union. In these circumstances the Postmaster General desires me to express his dissent from the doctrine enunciated in the second paragraph of the India Office letter and in the concluding paragraph in which it is sta.t ed that a claim to maintain the Agencies could not be supported/- 3 - 1100 supports* if challenged in the International Union. This view ascribes to the Postal Unioh a competence which it does not possess. The Postmaster General is also unable to see that any material difference arises from the fact that the Iraq Administration which now maintains some of the Agencies may not now be in the Postal Union - a point which in any case is for the moment uncertain. It has doubtless not escaped the attention of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that if the inter pretation given to the new wording of Article XLIII of the Detailed Regulations is accepted in the case of Persia it would presumably also be valid in the case of the British Agencies in Morocco, China and Turkey. The point is of little importance in the case of China in view of the decisions of the Washington Conference but it seems to be of material interest as regards Turkey and Morocco. I am, etc., (Sgd.)

Persia. The amende by Sir P. Lorai ents now reported ne to have been proposed by the| Persians in the draft memorandum of tne procedure to be followed appear to Mr. Secretary Montagu to afford a suitable basis for detailed negotiations by experts from either side and he shares Sir P. Moraine’s hope that the contents of this telegram may go far to remove the objections expressed by the Government of I nidi a in their telegram '204 S of 11th February. He had been expecting a furtner expression of opinion by the Government of India in the light of the telegram of 15th February from His Majesty’s Minister, but none having been received, he is communicating to them his own view as expressed in the foregoing sentences and elsewhere in this letter. A copy of telegram/is enclosed.llrflM* .?■ llr.

In recommending their abandon ment ^Mr. Montagu)had intended, as the Government of India have stipula ted, that it should b|p conditional on the Persian Administration under- taking to continue, with or without • outside assistance, thfc facilities hitherto afforded by these offices; for it is beyond question that their efficient conduct has been of great • value to British and Indian commercial interests in 8. Persia. Mr. Secretary Montagi^therefore deprecates the proposal of the Marquess Curzon, expressed in paragraph 2 of your to ! ; letter of 21st January,/refuse any assistance to the Persian Government in administering the offices to be transferred. He considers that it 7/GUld Dra 50® I Draft Paper. Department. would be more to the interests of His Majesty’s Government to render - and not too unostentatiously - any assistance required temporarily by the Persian Postal Administration and to secure that that Administration is maintained at the requisite state of efficiency. For the latter object, he ventures to express the view that Sir P. Loraine’s suggestion to seek a guarantee from the Persian Government of the continued supervisio n by European or American experts, is a sound one; and that the proposal (made irDparagraph of his telegram No. 20 and repeated in his telegram No. 110) to enlist the support of such of his colleagues, particularly the American Minister, as represent countries members of the Postal Union, merits approval. Mr. Secretary Montagu hopes that Lord Curzon will, on further consideration, agree. As regards the position of the wni ch Anglo-Persian Oil Company/is of course considerably affected by the transfer of the British offices to Persia, I am to incite Lord Curzon’s 5042—2 2000 1/22 attention to the correspondence with Sir A.!. Y/ilson of which a copy was forwarded toj^our Department under this Office letter P. 645 of 20th February. fFebruary. It appears to Mr .^Montagu ^ that the Anplo-Persian Oil Company, like^ His Majesty’s Government, would be well advised tot to stand aloof from the Persian Governments attempt to act up to its responsibilities as a member of the Postal Union, but to co-operate actively. By so doing, and by taking part, if the government of India -eoc no obiection7( vi-de tclcrrnm enoloocd)* in the negotiations between the Persian and Indian-Postal Administrations^the Company’s local representative would be likely-most readily to secure such special arrangements in respect of t ik (U concession areas as %rr ey requires without causing further friction with the Persian Government.

I have received, simultaneously with government of India's telegram unnumbered of February 11th, note from Persian government which comes a considerable way towards meeting objections which I formulated to Molitor on January 10th in the sense of paragraphs 4 and 5 of my telegram No.20. Present Persian government states that in the spirit of friendly conciliation it modifies riders of late govemnent(see my telegram No.19 bracketed paragraphs following 1C, 2C and 2D) for which fol lowing should bo respectively substituted. 1. Declaration of Persian government in paragraph C is not (/maintained) as regards date of July 1st fixed for complete suppression of Indian post offices in Persian Gulf. Persian and Indian postal administra tions shall fix date for entry into force of arrange ments to be concluded in virtue of paragraphs B and C of chapter 1 and Persian govoramont will take the necessary steps to avoid all interruption or disturb ance in special services in question during and after the transfer. • R. 9.15 a.m. 17th February No. 110. 2. Iraq postal administration will cease to operate on Persian territory as soon as possible. 3. Question...- 2 - 3. Question of compensation claimed is disconnect ed from that of suppression of Iraq post offices and will he subject Ff special negotiations between Persian government and His Majesty’s legation* Molitor further informs me that new Persian government withdraws its predecessor’s requesu for Tehran as seat of negotiations for closure of Gulf post offices, and present suggestion is that technical Persian delegate should go first to Bagdad and Arabistan to settle matters affecting Iraq postal administration and proceed thence to Calcutta for Gulf post offices negotiations. «\ It seems to me that procedure thus modified approximates’to that proposed in paragraph 2 of government of India’s telegrems Nos. 28 end 29 S, sno I had hoped therefore that it might be acceptable to government of India* I fear there is no prospect of Persian govern- mant admitting prescript!w‘right-tc -argue, as for them it is a (jaestion of sovereigntyj and- they are further convinced that their assumption o. : - all postal, services will materially increase their revenues. Result of Madrid convention has been tacitly to deprive Gulf post offices of their international status precisely hy their emission from detailed regulation of convention. Moreover Persian govern ment axe confident of their ability eventually to ensure the same facilities both to native and foreign interests which existing foreign post offices provide | and are prepared for examination of guarantees to that effect...r p ' ^784 - 3 - effect during the projected negotiations for transfer of services to their own postal administration. ■X think that government of India’s first line of arguments might have produced effect a year ago tut matters had gone too far by the time I arrived here. Goverment of India concede, though with reluctance which I fully understand, points of principle on whicn Persian government take their stand and that point necessarily becomes the basis of any negotiations. My willingness to sutmit proposals on that basis has enabled me po avert formal complaint to international postal union at Berae contemplated by Persian govern ment which might have seriously embarrassed government of India and His Majesty's Government, and in my opinion negotiations between technical delegates on the new basis offered in deference to my objections, present best opportunity for securing what is after all, principal British interest, namely efficiency of postal service. I adhere however to the opinion expressed in 'paragraph 7 of mj telegram No.20 that the interested members of postal union should•support our request for guarantees and it would be best for guarantees, when obtained, to be formally notified to union itself as I surety for their fulfilment.

Trevor and I will not go over.the ground afresh; it has na^oubt been fully covered officially by Lt-Jol Trevor already. I sincerely trust that the Lohammerah Office at least nil be retained (by India not by ’Iraq): it has been in existence since 1895 or so (vide appendix Persian Gulf gazetteer Vo! ) and H.i .Government may be regarded, as having acquired prescriptive rights in this connection by ilong usage. as regards Abadan. The admiralty and other Offices concerned arranged for a wireless installation at Abadan in 1913-14. To aeetjfce needs of I.ii.P. this was transferred m January 1915 to Basrah, and abaden was connected un bv A' «/ land line to Basrah. A new wireless plant for abadan is pow on order. Tntil it is executed and in working order it is essential^ that the Telegraph Office at aba dsn should be retained; it ix were removed abddsn would be unable to com municate with Tankers at the bar and at Gea and a very ■ i^^rous state of affairs in the Jhatt-el-arab owing to Overcrowding at abed an etc might result. 2he A.i'.G.O. were told when their wireless were token FWP ' 7 ' / that would be given land line connections withi Besrah r-nc 7 I think that it is up to K,B f s Government see that this undertaking is implemented. ^s regards the P.G. at the Gil Fields. It is of course Persian Government as it is on our private property* The same Persian Government have no Parcel Post convention with India and I suggest that until such a convention The monthly gross Postal receipts at these places for September last were Telegraphic receipts at Lohammereh for September were re^rcs Telegraph: I suggest that the T Irao Government should stipulate through rid f s 1 inister or other wise for the maintenance of the existing telephone service from «hadsn and I ohammerah to Basrah, as being essential for the commercial needs of .Basrah, which depends on Abadan for Gil Fuel. The n elegraph service is not adequate for the transmission of messages in regard thereto as it is not a £4 hour/service and involves - hours of delay - during which the Gil barges etc. would arrive at Basrah - unheralded, and would constitute a danger to the Port. You may think it best to let sleeping dogs lie, but should this point be raised I trust that either the !

I have discussed the whole question of southern post offices with Mr. Mo litor. We reached an understand ing as regards possible basis of procedure, which he undertook to draft. He has now sent me the following draft unofficially, having meanwhile submitted it to the council of ministers. Latter interpolated various pro visions which for distinction are placed between brackets hereinafter. 1. Gulf post offices. a. From date of protocol to be drawn up, these offices will cease to accept, despatch, receive, or distribute all correspondence and ail postal parcels governed by Persian postal monopoly and by conventions of universal postal union. b. These offices shol 1 continue to operate international exchange of money orders, (?paper post), 'and other special services which Persian post does not at present perform, but only until, in accordance with special arrangements to be concluded by postal administrations concerned, Persian post undertakes these ser vices. Until then these special services, although entrusted to agents of Indian posts, will be regarded as being conducted for the account of Persia. c. Administration concerned will forthwith appoint two delegates to settle as soon as possiole terms of special arrangements mentioned in 'b”, which will be immediately submitted to respective governments for ratification. As soon as Persian administration begins to carry out these special arrangements - savings bank always excepted - Indian post offices will be abolished forthwith. (Arrangements *of special services must be made so as to be put in force by 1st. July/( 2 ) July 1922. If the Government of India fail to send a technical delegate to Tehran in time for signature and ^ratification of arrangements by 1st May and enforcement by 1st July 1922, Indian post offices shall, nevertheless, be closed from 1st July). d. Persian postal administration agrees to take into its service in the southern offices any employees of Indian offices, being Persian subjects, who may so desire. e. It is a matter of course that when provisions of 'a” have been carried out by the Indian offices transit expenses payable by Persian post to Indian in respect of correspondence and mail bags transported by shipping and other services dependent on (? administration) will be calculated on the basis of new statistics to be compiled by mutual agreement between administrations concerned, and in accordance with mall convention of the univer sal postal union. 2. Mesopotamian offices in Arabistan. a. Prom 1st January 1922 all postal operations conducted by Mesopotamian offices in Persian Arabistan are undertaken for the account end benefit of the Persian government until their abolition or cession to Persian administra tion. b. Persian administration will send as soon as possible an expert delegate to Bagdad empow ered to determine in accord with Mesopotamian postal administration ways and means for abolition or (? cession) to Persia of these posts and also terms of an arrangement to be made by the two administrations for the redumption and continuation of special services - as in l.b. - now exploited by those offices. Arrangements etc. thus concluded to be communicated by delegate to the Persian government for approval. c. When terms of 'b' have been carried out, Persian delegate and an expert from Mesopot amian administration shall proceed forthwith to Arabistan end there take, in mutual agree ment. all steps necessary for carrying out provisions mentioned in 'b', and for handing over to the Persian treasury net receipts from Mesopotamian offices from 1st. January 1932 up to date of complete cessation of Mesopotamian dealing with postal matters in Persian territory. (This complete cessation must come/i (3) come about by 1st July 1922 at the latest). r' d. The same provisions as in l.d. (As regards 2.a. Persian government makes a reservation as regards compensation legally due to Persia for damage sustained through all kinds of postal operations conducted prior to 1st January 1922, first by Indian and later by Mesopotamian post offices in Persian Arabistan in (? violation,of)Persian postal monopoly - this includes offices at Abadan, Ahwaz, Maidoninaftun, Mohammerah and Oilfields).

In reply to request for postponement of action pending my arrival, Persian government state that according to arrangements made at postal congress at Madrid 'post offices in south' must be handed over to it on January 1st. next or abolished. As regards post offices at Mohammerah Ahwaz Abadan, oilfields, and Masjidi Suleiman Persian govern ment repeats that they were established without its consent and are alleged to belong to Mesopotamia whose political status has not yet been definitely settled. Their ( continued ) existence under Mesopotamian administration is contrary to political rights of Persian government. Note concludes by expressing confidence that before Persian government finds itself obliged to demand restoration of its rights by other means, I will put an end to long negotiations on the subject by giving immediate instructions for abolition of post offices. No indication of principle as regards Arabls- tan post offices has yet been (grp: om:) to Persian government/- 2 • government and I suggest informing it that as soon as necessary arrangements are made hy it with a view to ensuring facilities required hy Anglo-Persian Oil Company and for payment for transport of malls hy British India Navigation Company, see Mr. Bridgeman ? e telegram No.603 November 1st., post offices will he handed over. As regards Gulf post offices, I am informed that under Madrid convention of 1920 these win cease on January 1st. next to belong, as they have hitherto done, to international postal union so that any postal functions which they perform after that date would he in contraven tion of Persian law of Ramagan 15, 1333, establishing a postal monopoly in Persia. I am likewise informed hy Belgian director of posts that Indian postal authorities have instructed British Indian mailships in Gulf to accept postal hags from, and to deliver them to, Persian post offices in Gulf ports direct as from January 1st. If facts are as represented to me, and I know of no confirmation or otherwise from British sources, grounds for any negotiation such as Government of India suggest in their telegram No. 28 (? 28)-s of December 17th have been knocked from under our feet and no alternative seems open hut acquiescence in closure of Gulf post offices. Belgian postmaster-general declares that postal revenues will he amply sufficient to enable it to pay transport dues more especially as Government of India will become indebted to it in respect of considerable parcel post service from India to Persia greatly in excess of corresponding service from India to Persia (sic). Persian government calculates that surrender of Biltish post/'post offices v/ill increase its annual postal revenue by at least 60,000 tomans. I am urging suspension of any action by Persian government pending a reply to this telegram. Addressed to Foreign Office, Sent to India, No.718. 1 Repeated Bagdad, No.428.

The conditions of this class of conveyance are regulated by mutual con sent between the Administrations con cerned. Moreover, in all cases where the tran sit, either by land or by sea, is at present gratuitous or subject to more advan tageous conditions, such state of things is maintained. 7. Les frais de transit et d’entrepot sont a la charge de F Ad ministration du pays d’origine. 8.

Lorsque le solcle annuel des de- comptes des frais de transit et d entiepot entre deux Administrations ne depasse pas 1,000 francs, F Administration debi trice est exoneree de tout payement de ce chef. 7. The expenses of transit and ware housing are borne by the Administration of the country of origin. 8.

Les conditions du transport sont deter- minees de gre a gre entre les Administra tions interessees. Toutefois, les frais de transit afferents a chaque parcours effectue par voie aerienne sont uniformes pour toutes les Administrations qui font emploi de ce service sans participer aux frais d’exploitation. Article 5. Aerial Services. Aerial services established for the conveyance of correspondence between two or more countries are considered as analogous to the extraordinary services to which Article 4, § 6, refers. The conditions of conveyance are settled by mutual consent between the Administrations concerned.

Si Fenvoi a ete livre au destinataire sans encaissement du montant diy rem- boursement, Fexpediteur a droit a une indemnite, a moins que le non-encaisse- ment ne soit du a une faute ou une negligence de sa part. L indemnite ne pourra depasser, dans aucun cas, 1c mon tant du remboursement. 11 en est de meme si la somme encaissee du destina taire est inferieure au montant du rem boursement indique. Par le fait du payement de Findemnite, 1 Administra tion est subrogee dans les droits de Fexpediteur pour tout recours eventuel contre le destinataire ou les tiers. La responsabilite incombe a F Office du pays de destination, a moins que celui-ci ne puisse prouver que le non-encaisse- ment du remboursement ou F encaisse ment d’une somme inferieure est du a la non-observation d’une disposition regle- mentaire par F Office du pays d origine. 6.

Fhe compensa tion may not, in any case, exceed the amount of the trade charge. The same rule applies if the amount collected from the addressee is less than the amount of the trade charge indicated. By paying compensation the Administration takes over the rights of the sender in any action which may be taken against the addressee or third parties. The responsibility rests with the Office of the country of destination, unless the latter can prove that the failure to collect the trade charge or the collection of a smaller sum is due to a breach of the regulations by the Office of the country of origin. 6. As regards articles marked with trade charges of which the amount has been duly collected from the addressee but not forwarded to the sender, the Office of origin is authorised to pay this amount to the proper person within a year at latest from the day following the date of application.

The payment is also made on account of the Office of destination, if the responsibility rests with that Office by virtue of the provisions of § 5 above. The same rules apply if the Office of destination, duly informed of the applica tion, has let six months pass without settling the matter. This period is ex tended to nine months in relations with over-sea countries. The periods include the time necessary for the despatch of the request to the Office of destination and its return to the Office of origin. The Office of origin may, however, postpone exceptionally the compensation of the sender beyond the period before mentioned, when, at the expiration of this period, it has not been definitely informed as to the disposal of the article with trade charge, or as to the responsi bility incurred. The Office of destination is bound to repay to the Office of despatch the sums advanced under the conditions prescribed in § 5 above. Article 9. Cartes d’identite. 1.

Toutefois, les Administrations sont degagees de toute responsabilite pour la perte d’envois recommandes dont le con- tenu tombe sous le coup des interdictions prevues a Farticle 18, § 2, de la presente Convention. 2. Les pays disposes a se charger des risques pouvant deriver du cas de force majeure sont autorises a percevoir de ce chef sur Fexpediteur une surtaxe de 50 centimes au maximum pour chaque envoi recommande. 3. L’obligation de payer Findemnite incombe a FAdministration dont releve le bureau expediteur. Est reserve a cette Administration le recours contre F Admin istration responsable, c’est-a-dire contre FAdministration sur le territoire ou dans le service de laquelle la perte a eu lieu. En cas de perte, dans des circon- stances de force majeure, sur le territoire ou dans le service d’un pays se chargeant des risques mentionnes au paragraphe precedent, d’un objet recommande prove- nant d’un autre pays, le pays ou la perte a eu lieu en est responsable devant F Office expediteur, si ce dernier se charge, de son cote, des risques en cas de force majeure a Fegard de ses expediteurs. 4.

Article 10. Responsibility for registered Articles. 1. In case of the loss of a registered article, and except in cases beyond control, the sender is entitled to an indemnity of 50 francs. Administrations are, however, relieved from all responsibility for the loss of registered articles of which the contents fall within the prohibitions prescribed by Article 18, § 2, of the present Convention. 2. Countries prepared to undertake risks arising from causes beyond control are authorised to collect from the sender, on this account, a supplementary charge of 50 centimes at most for each registered article. 3. The payment of the indemnity must be undertaken b}^ the Administra tion to which the despatching office is subordinate. That Administration can make a claim on the Administration responsible, that is to say, against the Administration on the territory or in the service of which the loss took place. In case of the loss,under circumstances beyond control, on the territory or in the service of a country undertaking the risks mentioned in the preceding paragraph, of a registered article sent from another country, the country in which the loss occurred is responsible for it to the despatching Office, if the latter under takes risks in cases beyond control in dealing with its own public. 4. Until the contrary is proved, re sponsibility rests with the Administration which, having received the article without making any observation, and being fur nished with all the particulars for enquiry prescribed by the regulations, cannot establish delivery to the addressee or regular transfer to the following Adminis tration, as the case may be. For articles addressed “ Poste Restante,” or held at the disposal of the addressees, responsi bility ceases on delivery to a person who has proved his identity according to the rules in force in the country of destina tion, and whose name and description B 3 x iocs:)14 qualite sont conformes aux indications de I’adresse. 5.

Ce delai est porte a neuf mois dans les relations avec les pays d’outre- mer. L’Office expediteur a la faculte de differer exceptionnellement le reglement de I’indemnite au dela du delai precite lorsque, a son expiration, il n’est pas encore fixe sur le sort de I’objet recherche ou lorsque la question de savoir si la perte de Tenvoi est due a un cas de force majeure n’est pas encore tranchee. Toutefois, 1’Office d’origine est au- torise a desinteresser 1’expediteur pour le compte de F Office intermediaire ou des- tinataire qui, regulierement saisi, a laisse s’ecouler six mois (neuf mois dans les relations avec les pays d’outre-mer) sans donner de solution a Faffaire. L’Office responsable ou pour le compte duquel le payement est effectue en con- formite de Falinea precedent est tenu de rembourser a F Office expediteur le mon- tant de Findemnite et, le cas echeant, des interets dans le delai de trois mois apres avis du payement. Ce rembourse- ment s’effectue sans frais pour FOffice crediteur, soit au moyen d’un mandat de poste ou d’une traite, soit en especes ayant cours dans le pays crediteur. Passe le delai de trois mois, la somme due a F Office expediteur est productive d’inter ets a raison de 7 % Fan, a dater du jour de Fexpiration dudit delai.

Il est entendu que la reclamation n’est admise que dans le delai d’un an, a compter du jour qui suit le depot a la poste de Fenvoi recommande; passe ce terme, le reclamant n’a droit a aucune indemnite. 7. Si la perte a eu lieu en cours de transport sans qu’il soit possible d’etablir sur le territoire ou dans le service de quel pays le fait s’est accompli, les Adminis trations en cause supportent le dommage par parts egales. 8.

The payment of the indemnity by the despatching Office must take place as soon as possible, and at the latest cv within six months of the date of the application. This period is extended to nine months in relations with over-sea countries. The despatching Office may excep tionally postpone settlement of the in demnity beyond the period mentioned when, on its expiry, it has not been definitely informed as to the disposal of the article enquired for, or when the question whether the loss of the article is due to a cause beyond control is not vet decided. %/ The Office of origin is, however, authorised to settle with the sender on account of the Office, whether inter mediate or of destination, which, duly informed of the application, has let six months (nine months in relations with over-sea countries) pass without settling the matter. The Office responsible or on whose account the payment is made in accord ance with the preceding paragraph is bound to repay to the despatching Office the amount of the indemnity and, if occasion arise, interest, within a period of three months after notice of payment. This repayment is made free of cost to the creditor Office, by means of either a money order or a draft, or in coin current in the creditor country. After the period of three months, the sum due to the despatching Office bears interest, at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum, dating from, the day of expiry of the said period. In case an Office of which the responsi bility is duly proved has at first declined to pay the indemnity, it must, in addi tion, bear all the necessary charges resulting from the unwarranted delay in payment. 6. It is understood that the applica tion for an indemnity is only entertained if made within a year, counting from the day following the posting of the registered article; after this term the applicant has no right to any indemnity. 7. If the loss has occurred in course of conveyance without its being possible to ascertain on the territory or in the service of what country the loss took place, the Administrations concerned bear the loss in equal shares. 8. Administrations cease to be respon sible for registered articles for which the owners have given a receipt and accepted15 cr\ i livraison, ainsi que des envois dont elles ne peuvent rendre compte par suite de la destruction des documents de service pour cause de force majeure. delivery, as well as for articles which they cannot account for in consequence of the destruction of official documents through a cause beyond control.

The .tritish I&lt;egation is informed that according to the statement made by the Indian Director General of Posts at Madrid the Anglo-India,n post offices which had been pro- visionally established, during the international war, at Mohajnmerah, Ahwaz and Obbadan have been transferred to the Mesopotamian postal administration and therefore they have been deprived of the right of taking part in the postal union. The transfer of the above mentioned post offices to the Postal Administration of Mesopotamia has already been formally announced by the International Office at Eerne, of the ^©stal Union on the part of the Indian Postal Adminis tration, to all the departments of the Postal Union. The above mentioned oost offices being in Persia, which is a. member of the Postal Union, and their transfer to the postal administration of Mesopotamia, which so far has not been received by the Postal Union and that country being still without political principles, justify Persia to demand the immediate abolition of the said offices which originally had been established during the war solely as military necessity. In view of the conclusion of the war it is hoped that, a.s it ha,s been repeatedly promised by the Legation, necessary steps will be taken as soon as possible for the abolition of the above mentioned offices so that the Imperial Govern ment may not suffer any more losses.

It points out that as Mesopotamia is not a member of International Postal Union, these offices do not enjoy the privileges to which Persian membership of the Union entitles them. The following objections have been raised by Anglo- Persian Oil Company to the surrender of fees to Persian postal department. 1. Deprivation of regular and safe postal service. 2. Loss of value payable post. 3. Loss of money order system. 4. Loss of savings bank system. With regard to these objections, Persian Post master General mokes the following observations. 1. There will be no controller if offices are handed over as desired by Persian Governmen'u. If offices are closed, Persian postal administration will create new ones. Postmaster General expresses the opinion that total closure would harm British prestigeprestige and hopes for surrender rather than clomaru of such. 2.

They demand office and housing accomodation from the Anglo Persian and then proceed to pocket all profits. The post office is a disgrace to any community. It consists of a small room in a tin shed. The floor is always littered with registered parcels and letters as well as ordinary correspondence. To obtain admittance it is necessary to walk over these parcels which seem to be severely battered. (rovemment packages also receive the same treatment.. The staff is composed of two Indian natives and a boy. Telegrams in code are badly mutilated and lose their meaning in consequence. When the population of some 14 f 000 Indian, Persian and Arab employees is taken into consideration, it seems nothing short of a marvel that any letters are received at all. The postal requirements also of the Company are enormous including telegrams. All parcels have to be sent to the Persian Customs who attend to them when they think fit. ?ome of these parcels return to their owners but a large number do not. I have never seen anything so deplorable as the Abadan Post Office. (signed) A. H. Field. Admiralty Inspector of Oil Fuel. Abadan, PEPSIA. 26.5.21. No.A.P.l/ll. c r *»'ia'&gt; v n 2 4 8 9 (32) ' .

Since Mr. Norman wrote his despatch circumstances have , , thp An^l n-P&lt;= rsian n onv° nt ^ o a changed a good c*el in Persia, * - of 1919 is a dead letter, th-e has been a coup d’etat at Teheran and there is ne^regirne there. It ? possible that the new Government will not press the matter of the Post 3 Tquite see that the various arguments put forward for the retention of our Post Offices ere not very convincing 0 the Persian Government, but on the oth T •- t , there is no question of getting the Persian Government to agree to the Angl o-Persian Convention, there seems to ce no reason why we should give up the British Indian Post Offices i n Persia until the Persian Government can snow tust cient offices can replace them. 4. A. .. , can aaa Pe-a.an Pet Ottica authoCt:ea chiefly meant the pmaanc, at the Bdtl.h Ottlcs at ^ AbadanAbadan anc the oil fields on account of the la^ge revenue said to he derived from the Money Order and v alue Payable Parcel receipts at th/se places. I am Inclined to thi ik that \ jf these two offices were handed over to the Persian Post Office, the P e rs1an Gove rnment wouId not 1 ns 1st o n t ak1ng over the other offices. If I am correct In this view, and If the Persian Government continue to pr^ss the matter f perhaps they rrrVht be conciliated by closing the t™c offices above- mentioned. It would, I think, be possible(though not very satisfactory) to do this, nd get the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany to arrange privately for remittances on behalf of such of their employees who do not trust the Persian Post Office to be made to the Company 1 s Head Office at Mohammerah, and then have the money orders despatched from Mohammerah. that I am aw a from persona] ^xperienc 0 when at Mohammerah that this 1 ? unsatisfactory r s great delays in despatch o money orders and wrong delivery or loss of parcels odten takes place, and I only suggest this as a pis aller. It would, however, have the advantage that the Persian Government system became efficient it would gradually absorb all the business and acquire the revenue to be made out of it. 5. I fancy, however, that the Postal services in the Persian Gulf and South Persia hardly pay their ^ay, no 3 C this is the case, and the Persian Government can be convinced ot it, a. Should hardly think that they will insist on assuming exclusive control of the Gulf Offices. 6. As the control of our Interests In Arabistsa has teen handed hack to the Government of India, and as Mesopotamia wj 11 probably become an Arab State before long,' prps.-me the Post and Telegraph Offices in Arabian will he hand ed hack to the Indian Post Office and Indo-European Telegraph Department respectively, as it ^11 be anomalous to maintain them as part of the Mesopotamia Post and Telegraph Pep -nn^it. t po vp the honour to be, -IJ y Your most obedient gcrvent, gd A P Trevor ,Li eut. -Col. , Political Resident In the Persic se nt to II.

It appears from Sir Esme Howard's despatch that the Persian Minister at Madrid / acting on instructions which had been previously received from the Persian Government (and which owing to telegraphic delays were not cancelled as promised by the Persian Prime Minister to ivir.Norman in Teheran ) / made in the Postal Congress a declaration of which but slight notice was taken and which appears to have given rise to no discussion. 5. The British Post Offices in the Persian Gulf have, however, now been declared anomalous, seeing that they are no longer excluded from the Postal Union as they were before. It will, therefore, be necessary for Mr.Norman to negotiate with the Persian Government for the means whereby their position will be rendered less anomalous before the next Congress meets. 4. Lord Curzon, therefore, proposes, subject to the concurrence of Ivir • Montagu, to instruct Mr .Norman that he should, on hearing from the Government of India, with whom he has already been in correspondence, enter into negotiations with the Persian Government in the matter.

I think we may be rather thankful that the difficult position of British Indian Post Offices in the Persian Oulf was kept out of discussion at hie Congress.' observe, reasonable and anodyne both in matter and expression, end I think the Persian l Inister deserves credit for the way in which, at &amp;r.

First Committee of Postal Congress have accepted without any opposition a modification in text of Article 44 detailed in principal convention of Rome omitting clauses 1, 6, (? 7) 8, 9, 11 end 12.

It is almost certain that revised text will be accepted by full Congress and I consider it useless to try and make any special exception for British Indian post offices in Persia.

My Lord, 1 have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship’s letter Ho. C 10425/8811/34 dated the 15th instant, regarding the British Indian Post Offices in Persia. The negotiations between the Persian Government and the British Legation in Tehran, on the subject, which have been mentioned in Your Lordship’s letter must have been taken olace bef'ji e t ne Persian Government sent a Delegation to the Postal Congress at Madrid. I understand that the Persian Delegation have been instructed by the Persian Government to put the matter before the Congress. The Persian Delegation, however, before doing so approached the Delegation of the Government of India for the purpose of bringing about a friendly settlement. The matter has been discussed between the two parties; the Delegation of the Government of India agreed with the Persian Delegation, but stated that they required instructions from the British Government to settle tne matter. Therefore they have referred to the British Government which have been awaiting a reply from the Government of India and from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. These, however, have not been received before the 12th instant (the day of the meeting of the Congress at Madrid). According to a telegram received from the Persian Delegation, a copy of which has been sent to Your Lordship enclosed in my previous letter, the Persian Delegation v/ill wait until the 22nd instant (the last meeting of the Postal Congress) before bringing the case before the Congress. The Persian Delegation trust that ^nis delay will give Your Lordship sufficient time to hear from tne Government of India and from the British Minister at Tehran. I have, etc., r (Signed) M.

MOST URGENT . oOo From your telegram No. 74 6 (of 16th November), it is not evident whether instructions to Persian postal delegates at Madrid are of nature to secure complete and final removal of question from agenda of Congress. This is eminently desirable. Secretary of State for India endorses views of Government of India in their telegram No. 1305 S. of 10 th November which has been repeated to you, and urges that you should make representations to Persian Government in sense of first two paragraphs thereof and press for cancellation of any instructions to delegates to raise matter. Urgent action is essential as delegates have threatened to bring matter forward on 22nd November. PI ease act according^. You should add that immediate attention is being given to complaints made of action by offices infringing Postal Union rules. We realize that if your representations are successful as re ards Madrid Congress it will still be necessary to discuss with Persian Government future maintenance of offices and administrative questions arising therefrom.

Further, in event oi non success ol above representations Mr. Clarke might state frankly that continuance of these offices appears to His Majesty*s Government matter for settlement by diplomatic channels and that his instructions preclude him from discussing them at a postal congress. We are rather doubtful whether any appeal of above nature will move M. Molitor and his Persian colleague.

Five older post-officers namely Bushire, Lingah, Bandar Abbas, Jask and Mohammerah date back from 30 to 50 years and our claim to maintain them is based on prescriptive rights of Local usage and custom while recently opened offices in Arabistan are essential to contentment of large Indian Staffs employed on Oilfields. Although we may admit that our Postal rights in GAlf are some what anomalous when judged by rules of postal Union we contend that for hostorical reasons these post offices occupy a privileged position, which ought not to be judged by or made to confbra to the rules of other nations. For these reasons the questions have always ’ been treated as subject, for diplomatic representation rather / than from purely postal point of view. Two.

We should regret it extwemely for Comnercial and Political reasons if these post offices were closed. Main reasons for their maintauence are as follows. First. Indian Comnercial interests in Persia have been built up almost entirely on combined Parcel Post, Money Order and value payable system. Bills of Lading being sent value payable. Persian Post Office does not at present provide for any of these but only for letters; nor is it probableprobable that Persian Staffs available would be able to 2. conduct these systems efficiently for many years. Abolition of British Post Offices would therefore be very Their contentment depends largely on maintenance of this facility and also regular receipt of Indian letters. certainly not secure this and grave discontent would follow which would be matter of Imperial Importance. ‘of start money-order system would involve serious difficulty. 3. As regards five points raised by Molitor we comaent as follows:- (l) Competition^ complained of is due pasted in the nine British Indian post offices stamped with Indian stamps from which India gets the revenue. I* was agreed some time ago that any articles posted in these places in the Persian post offices should also be forwarded but probably British India post offices get the bulk of the traffic owing to their greater effiency. There is no way post offices remain open* (2) Under Union Regulations I 1*^ feut &lt; &amp; L*4 14*. ^ Persian clainu is reasonable. ” We can only justify ^^ ^ concession on tlie ground tliat it lias been long acQuiesed in, *v, a + Mail Steamer service is entirely subsidised by M- k/Aii. l J i the S &amp; I. and that concession is a graet convenience to ships in the anchorage and to general public and business firms who are able to post them at last moment.

British Embassy 25th October,1^20.Q My Lord:- The new Persian Minister to Madrid, Mirza Hussein Khan Alai called on me to-day. He is no doubt well known to all those British Diplomats who have been stationed at Tehran as he occupied, I believe, for a long time a position equivalent to that of Permanent Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. He is a brother to the Persian Minister in London and was educated altogether in England and speaks and writes English perfectly. The Belgian Minister here, Baron de Borchgrave, knew him intimately in Tehran and tells me that he looked on him as exceptionally intelligent, and as | almost the only honest Persian he had ever met. I But Baron de Borchgrave says he is strongly nation- lalist in sympathy and possibly for that reason very anti-British. The Persian Minister, who is also Persian Delegate to the Postal Conference, let me know through Mr. Clarke, Delegate of the Government of India, that he would like to call on me oefore he present ed his letters to the King of Spain as he wished to talk to me on matters connected with the Conference, and I, of course,replied that I should oe very glad to see him. His object in coming to see me was naturally/ The Earl Curzon of Kedleston, K.G.,-2- naturally to discuss the question of the British Indian Post Offices in the Persian Gulf about which I have already reported to Your Lordship in my telegram ITo. 344 of October 14th. As soon as he broached the subject I told him that I was not in any way qualified to discuss the question and had only acted as a means of communication between Mr. Clarke and His Majesty’s Government. He then gave me the Persian view of the question, with which Your Lordship is no doubt al ready acquainted, saying that if His Majesty’s Government agreed to the abolition of these Post Offices this would be received with great satis faction in Persia as evidence that Great Britain was sincerely anxious to assist Persia in obtain ing the full administrative independence which was her right. I asked whether this was not rather a political question to be dealt with oy direct negotiation between the two Governments than one to be submitted to the Postal Conference. He replied that as the Postal Conference of Home of 1906 had recognised the existence of these Indian Post Offices as forming part of the Union, it was tc -M' ^ -kwl | necessary for the Conference to withdraw tneir recog- } iC^ h I n ition if they were to be abolished. If, he said, the Conference did not do so, the Persian Government proposed to bring the matter before the League of 'Nations. He seemed, however, genuinely anxious that the abolition should take place by agreement with His Majesty’s Government and that the Persian Delega tion should/tion should not have to act in opposition to His Majesty’s Government either at the Conference or possibly later by appealing to the League of Hat!ons. I repeated that, though I v^as, of course, interested in what he had told me I had neither authority nor capacity to discuss the matter. He left me with a memorandum on the subject by Mr. Molitor, the Belgian Official in charge of the Persian Post Office who is also here, copy of which I have the honour to enclose.

Tt was there- fore in these circumstances that the Council of Ministers in Teheran approved of the following Instructions being given to their delegates at the Postal Conference: 'si la f dlligatlon ne recolt avant le 5 Octubre 192 avis de Teheran 1'informant de ce que le louvernement de 1'Inde Brltarmique a consentl d suprrlmer les bureaux de post# Anglo-Indian itablls en Perae, la d4l^g»tlon de Perse entrera sana d4lai en pourparler offlclel avec le* delegations de 1'Tnde Bri^annique et de la brands Lretagne en vue d'obtenlr 1'acceptatlon de la suppression de* bureaux prementionm's.\ *n cas de en tout ca&lt;§ si Is delegation de Perse ne . rec^it p*s satisfaction par une communication offlcielle de la Post© de 1'Tnde Britannique confirmee par une coi’minication officielle. du Winistre des Poles et dea Telegraphies de Perse elle soumettra la question au Oongr^s Postal.'’ In the light of these Instructions the Persian Pelegation telegraphed to Teheran on the 4th October asking whethe the discussion with Hr.

Your telegran No. 189, Before I have had time to communicate contents to Mr. Clarke Persian Minister called on me this morning and I ventured to speak to him in the sense of your telegram. He said that he would be very glad if his Government sent instructions that it was unnecessary to bring matter before the Conference, but that he had specific instructions to do so if question ms not settled diplomatically beforehand and that probably latest date up to which he could defer action here would be November 12th. If Indian Government has no objection in principle to abolition of Post Offices m question, as appears to be the case, and there is good hope of a diplomatic arrangement, it might be advisable to ask Persian Government to instruct their representative here that action at Conference is unnecessary.Previous Papers :—In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. C ^19/8811/34 8 nd address, Akot to any person by name, torfto— \ J “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.

Palace Hotel, Madrid, 15th October, ; Dear Mr. Oliphant, At last I have arrived here and taken up my duties. After a rest at Svian and Territet , I came here on the 11th instant, with instructions to represent Persia at the Postal Congress. Monsieur Molitor who is also a delegate, and is well-known to you, had already come into touch with Mr. G.R, Clarke, Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, representing India; he had, in accordance with powers given him by the Persian Government, discussed witi his Indian Colleague, and handed him a memorandum on, the question of the Anglo-Indian post offices established in Persian territory, in the Gulf, by the Indian postal authorities. This matter, as you are aware, has often been tne subject of representations made to your Legation in Teheran, and in view of the Madrid Conference the Persian Government have again recently approached Mr. Norman with a request that the position be put right and this long-* standing grievance which hampers our administration and weighs on our minds be finally removed. I have no doubt tnat the matter has already come before you and is receiving tfre earnest attention of His Britannic Majesty’s Government. I understand that Mr. Clarke is satisfied that our demands are perfectly legitimate, and that the closing of the Anglo-Indian office at Abadan, Ahwaz, Hendjam and Chahbar, of recent creation, and the handing over to the Persian postal administration of the services established some years ago at Bouchir, Bander-Abbas, Djashk, Lingah and Mohammerah are eminently desirable. He has reported m /in a favourable sense to Your Ambassador at Madrid, and His Excellency has, I am told, telegraphed on the subject to the Foreign Office. In instructing Monsieur Molitor and myself to discuss the situation with the Delegate of the Government of India, the Persian Government have no doubt the* desire to arrive at a speedy and amicable solution; they consider, moreover, that an international congress is one of the rare opportunities which render possible, not only a direct and useful exchange ofviews between the respective heads of departments, but also the equitable adjustment of any I|differencesthat may exist between any two countries. I venture to submit this matter to you very frankly and privately, because I have had experience of your friendship -Tor Persia and of your sense of justice. I feel sure that you will use your great influence to have the necessary powers given sur un pied administratif to Mr • Clarke to negotiate with Monsieur Molitor the transfer of the Indian postal service in Persia to the Persian Administration. I enclose under a separate cover a copy of the memorandum handed on the 11th instant by Monsieur Molitor to Mr. Clarke, and I would add that the measure contemplated will in no way be detrimental to the interests and require ments of merchants, residents and others who still use the Anglo-Indian offices, for it is quite understood that the Persian postal administration will, in agreement with the Indian postal authorities, take steps to maintain and extend any advantages and facilities which the public may have enjoyed under the present regime; for instance the exchange jof postal money-orders with the rupee as unit will not be interfered with as well as the despatch of insured letters and small boxes and parcels etc. On the other hand the parcel/' fr parcel-post and ordinary postal traffic in general has been going on regularly for a long time between Persia and India in accordance with the regulations of the Postal Union. Mr. Clarke’s opinion and the satisfaction expressed by all members of the Union in their relations with us testify to the efficiency of the Persian postal administration and should convince you that our postal intercourse with India and with other foreign countries via the Gulf will continue unimpaired and be further improved. Finally, I need not expatiate on the excellent impression which Great Britain’s decision to hand over these offices - consistently with the respect for Persia’s independence and the new spirit which is the outcome of the War - will make in Teheran as well as on the 66 States whose representatives are assembled at Madrid. Your Country^ prestige and the great faith which we as well as other members of the League of Nations have always had in it’s sense of fair play, will be considerably enhanced. With Monsieur Molitor’s kind regards and hoping to hear from you very soon, I remain, etc., (Signed) Hussein Alai.I■fT' . . “~!k 23 j0T!920 H.Molitor,Director-Generalof Fosts in Persia,has v/arned me privately that he has received instructions from the Persian Government to make the following pro posals to the Universal Postal Congress at Madrid,in case no understanding is arrived at regarding the clos ure of the British-Indian post offices in the Persian Gfclf.

Tnere are y post offices,namely, Mohammerah, Abadan, Ahwaz, Bushire, Bandar Abas, Chahbar, Henjaia, Jask and Linga, which are in Persian territory and under British-Indian administration. Recently,however,for purposes of admini strative convenience,the control of the 3 offices in Persian Arabistan,namely,MOhamnierah,ADadan ana Ahwaz, has been transferred to the Postal Administration of Mesopotamia,to which territory these offices are in close proximity. The history or tne establishment or post oiflces in Lae Persian GujlI* dates DacK to 1 u o4 when an office was estaoxisned at aushlre in connection with the Con sular mans, ufflees were opened at Linga and Bandar Abas m 166? ana at Jasic m Ibow. The post office at Moharamerah was opened in 1oy2 with the express consent of the Shah of Persia. Post offices were opened at Henjam in Chahbar in 1^14 and at Abadan and Ahwaz in 1y15. The establishment of the British-Indian post offices in the Persian Gulf up to 1692 was due to the necessity for dealing with Consular mails as no Persian postal service existed. The Director-General of posts in Persia has tried on many occasions to secure the closure of these post offices on the ground thatjPersia has joined the Universal Postal Union and established an efficient postal service of its own. in 1906 the Persian delegation at the Universal Postal Congress at Rome Joined the Turkish delegation in protesting against the existence of foreignpost offices in territories belonging to countries which had joined the Postal Union. The protest was duly noted but no other actionwas taken on it With respect to the points raised by M.Molitor,the following action has been taken by the Indian Govern ment to ensure that the British-Indian post oriices in .Persia shall not enter into unfair competition with Persian post offices:- Coinpjtlnt* Redress. 1• Complaint by M.

Mohammerah. To rerslan poet office Bushire; Bandar Abas; Mohammerah* a 19 M U tf Bushire; Bandar Abas; Linga. It mayjalso be pointed out that these mails are con- veyed in the mail steamers of the British India Steam I^avigdtion Go.,to which the Indian G-overnment pays every year a large subsidy quite out of proportion to the value of the mail service and that the Persian jpostal Admini stration is not called upon to pay any charge whatsoever for the|conveyance of its mails by these steamers. In conclusion I should observe that the points which M.Moiitor proposes to refer to the Congress at .xadrid have only been placed before me on the 11th October, 1920. They raise a very important diplomatic question re garding the status of British-Indian post offices in the ' Persic^rjG-ulf, with which I,as a postal of ficer, cannot deal and concerning which the Postal Congress is hardly in a position to offer any opinion. Unfortunately the very existence in Persia of these post offices,which have not been established under any Treaty,enables the Persian Administration to point out that all mails received at and despatched from these offices are dealt with contrary to the terms of the International Postal Conventions and albo gives it an opportunity to propose certain special auditions to the Articles of those Conventions designed to meet conditions which are not provided for in the postal relations recognised between countries which are members of the Universal Postal Union.- . - '- 5 - «S 3 B / X &gt; ' / Tn any further communication on this subject, please quote ./* No. j. / ami address, not to any person by name, but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Otfice, London, S.W.LIn any further communication on this subject, please quote and address— not to any person by name, but to- ^ Ui &gt; “ Tl^ Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. 7661 19^0 © Confidential THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to fiC and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop^ of the under-mentioned paper.

They relate to negotiations between the British Government, the Government of India, and the Persian Government, over the status of British Indian post offices in south Persia, which took place before, during, and after the Congress of the Universal Postal Union, held in Madrid in November 1920. The volume’s principal correspondents include: the British Ambassador to Madrid (Sir Esme Howard); the Persian Minister to Madrid (Hussein Khan Alai); India Office staff (David Taylor Monteath; Leonard Day Wakely; John Evelyn Shuckburgh); Foreign Office officials (including Lancelot Oliphant); the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs in India (Geoffrey R Clarke); and the British Minister at Tehran (Herman Cameron Norman; Sir Percy Lyham Loraine).The correspondence centres on a threat by Persian Government officials to raise an official objection against the continued presence in Persia of British Indian post offices at the Madrid Congress. British Government officials were anxious to avoid such a move, fully appreciating the ‘anomalous’ position of their Persian post offices under the regulations of the Universal Postal Union. The correspondence indicates the Government of India’s amenability to handing over certain postal operations to the Persian authorities (folio 251), and the concerns held by many in the British Government over such a prospect (ff 288-289), not least their doubts over whether the Persian authorities could run an efficient postal service themselves.The volume includes:a commentary of proceedings at the Madrid Congress, including copies of the speeches given by Persian ministers (ff 247-249), description of their reception (f 251), and a printed copy of the Madrid Convention (ff 143-158);correspondence relating to the impact of changes in Anglo-Persian relations (after the 1921 coup d’état in Persia) on Persian demands for the abolition of British Indian post offices in Persia (ff 217-218);throughout 1921, continued demands from the Persian Government for the transfer of British Indian post offices to Persian control, and in particular those now under (post-war) Mesopotamian administration (Abadan and Mohammerah [Khorramshahr]) and the post office at Ahwaz [Ahvāz];from January 1922, debate amongst British officials (Government of India, the Minister in Tehran, Foreign Office, India Office) and negotiations between British and Persian Government officials over arrangements for the transfer of British Indian postal services in Persia to Persian administration, with a view to the transfer taking place on 1 January 1922. Included is a copy in French of the agreement between British and Persian officials for the proposed transfer, dated 5 January 1922 (ff 54-57), discussion relating to the importance of sustaining a postal service for areas serving the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) oil fields, and reports of the dismissal of the Director of the Persian postal service (Camille Molitor) in March 1922, causing consternation amongst British officials (ff 47-49, ff 84-91);British officials’ examination of events at the Washington Conference (1921/1922), which provided an analogous diplomatic situation to their own (negotiations for the withdrawal of United States post offices from China) (ff 81-83);the British Government’s assent, in April/May 1922, to the abolition or transfer to the Persian authorities of its post offices in Persia and Arabistan (ff 20-22, ff 66-70).Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Universal Postal Union</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Spain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Minister to Madrid</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director-General of the Persian Postal Service</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director General of Posts and Telegraphs, India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Postal services</topic></subject><subject><topic>Madrid Congress (1920)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Washington Conference (1921-1922)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000089#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
