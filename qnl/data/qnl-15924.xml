The correspondence also discusses the Persian Government's disinterest and unwillingness to engage with the British Government on the matter and the question of what the Resident in the Persian Gulf's powers and responsibilities should be in preventing incidents at sea from occurring.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023652099.0x000001#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023652099.0x000001#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023652099.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
