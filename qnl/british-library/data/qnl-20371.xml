King Ibn Saud's protest against the visits of motor cars to the frontier and neutral zones and against the flights of aeroplanes over Nejd territory is somewhat singular in view of the fact that, as reported by Sir Edward Ellington in his telegram No. 558 (No. 617, to Resident, Bushire, and Political, Kuwait) (Enclo. 3 to Serial No. 62), dated the 18th of November 1927, no aeroplane or armoured car had up to the date of the attack on Busaiyah been near the Nejd-Iraq frontier or the neutral zone since last April. His Majesty's letter on the subject is not very definite and it occurs ro me that he may have had in mind the proposed Arabian air route from Basrah to Karachi, his objection to which as you are aware he has already based on the alleged military activities of the Iraq Government on the Nejd frontier. 4. Provided you agree, I do not propose to reply to either of these letters until a reply is received from King Ibn Saud to the communication referred to in your telegram No. 409, dated the 14th of November 1927. 5. I would invite your attention in this connection to Sir Edward Ellington's secret despatch, dated the 21st of October 1927, forwarding a translation of an earlier letter from King Ibn Saud on the subject of the Busaiyah post. Materials for a full reply to this letter have been collected, but the attack on the Busaiyah post occurred before the reply could be des patched, and consequently it has not been sent. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to His Majesty's Political Agent, Kuwait,4 Enclo. VIII to Serial No. 67. Translation. Letter fegm Abdtjl Aziz Bin Abdul Eahman al Faisal al Saud, to • His Excellency the British High Commissioner for Iraq, No . 2/3- M./3/27, dated 10 th Jamadi Al-Awwal , 1346 (6 th November 1927). We have already addressed to Your Excellency two letters when we were in the Hijaz, the first dated 9lh Rabi Al-Awwal, 1346 (5th September 1927) and the second dated 24th Rabi Al-Awwal, 1346 (21st September 1927), No. 2/3-M./3/27, in which we explained to Your Excellency the effect upon the souls of the contravening of Articles ot* the Uqair Protocol concluded on 12th Rabi Al-Awwal 1341, by the construction of forts at Busaiyah and Nabah (or Niah), and told you of the commotion this action will cause in Nejd and the troubles it will create. On arrival at the capital of our Nejd territory there was submitted to us from all directions in Nejd protests against the con struction of these forts deeming the same to be in contravention of the treaties between ourself and Iraq. The rumours which have reached the tribes as a result of the work of construction have been very effective in the causing of commotion. It has reached them, as I have informed you in my previous letter, that the Iraq Government had constructed these military posts in order to threaten Nejd with them and that they were going to build a railway to Busaiyah and Nabah with a view to strengthening'these military posts against Nejd. Although I myself do not believe in the truth of these rumours, I however interpret this daring action of certain Iraq officials, in their con struction of this fort only as a means to bring about misunderstandiDg and difference between us and Britain. But our desire not to leave any way open for difference to arise between us has induced us frankly to explain to you. the facts about the situation in Nejd in order that you may do your best—which we have no doubt you will do—for the solving of this problem and the closing up ot the avenue of difference. As you are aware, most of the inhabitants of Nejd are desert-men and that the greater part of their winter abode in winter and spring is in the northern and eastern regions of our country, close to the Iraq frontier and far away from our headquarters. Aware as I am of the evil effect on their minds of the threat of this fort, I am, fearful of some sort of aggression on it being taken by them, though it may spell the destruction and extermination, of their lives. We are afraid of such result which is loathsome to us. That is why we have addressed to you two letters from the Hijaz for the purpose of averting such things before serious developments set in. It is however regretted that we have had no answer from you to our two letters. Out of the desire on our part to expedite the removal of the cause of difference we have written this to Your Excellency, hoping that you will order the removal of these forts which are contrary to Article 3 of the above mentioned Protocol and the retention of which is fraught with evil possibilities of a nature that I cannot bear. Responsibility for any incident ,that may occur will fall on the shoulder of him who has been the cause of the contravention of the text of the Protocol. As you are aware, I am doing my very best to prevent causes of difference and am striking with an iron rod on the arms of any one wishful of disturbing the peace of the relations between us in the present circumstances. But, as it is not hid from you, our headquarters are remote and our people are on the borders of Iraq, with the argument in their hands ; while vile intriguing comes their way from the direction of Iraq. In the circumstances I am unable to guarantee the safety of the frontiers so long as this new post, contrary to agreements, stands between us. I am strongly confident of Your Excellency's assistance towards the removal of this post in order that tranquillity may be preserved. Please accept my profound respect. (Seal of Ibn Saud.) -P.

Letter from Abdul Aziz Bin Abdul Rahman al Faisal al Saud, to His Excellency the British High Commissioner for Iraq, No. 3/1003 } dated 10th Jamadi Al Awwal 1346 (6th November 1927). It has reached us that some aeroplanes from Iraq fly over the borders of our territories and over our tribes, some of them landing in the midst of our lands and taking off again; also that motor cars run through the neutral areas and on the extremities of the borders. Your Excellency is aware that the most important object of our concern is the maintenance of good relations between the two Governments and that we loathe all that may result in the disturbance of peace. Aeroplanes in flying and motor cars in running fly and run only over a desert that abhors such flying and running. Therefore I am fearful lest they should come up against some fellow who knows nothing about them, and I request that you will issue orders to officials and non-officials to avoid routes running through our borders, for their own safety and for the safety of the friendly relations between the two parties against possible disturb ance which we neither wish nor approve of. Please accept my profound respect. (Seal of Ibn Saud.)6 \ I wrote to Your Excellency the day before yesterday, after I had arrived at Riyadh and described the increasing spirit of disquietude'prevalent on the frontier, the ill consequences of which I feared and still fear, as I do not wa f anything of the sort, which certainly does not please me.

I have not yet obtained any confirmation of this, but I immediately ordered the forces resposible for the safety of the, frontier to follow them and investigate the report that they have crossed my frontier, and if possible, prevent them from doing so. I hope to hear that they have been stopped, but I have ordered their arrest and punishment if the story about them be true.

Ihn Saud has now,summoned Ulema of Ikhawan and they are on their way to Riyadh. He thinks that there is little fear of further raid Just at present, as Ikhwan will prohahly wait to see result of conference 'between Ibn Saud and Ulema, and he has little doubt Ihn Saud will succeed in talking the latter round and making them see reason.

The refugee Shamar trihe £&amp;tid Nejd territory and we protested to High Commissioner* About November last year High Commissioner warned us that party of Shamar having left Mesopotamia were gathering in Syrian desert with intention attacking our tribes. As attacking tribes cannot enter our territory without previously traversing territory Trans-Jordan or Mesopotamia we protested against Mesopotamian Government# High Commissioner sent no answer to our protest. Ten months later Mesopotamian Goveni- ment began to build military posts at wells near frontier and spread rumour that those places would Join up by rails and _ become strong fortresses on weak frontier. This action had worst effect among Nejd tribe, ^ t0 Article 3 Uqair Agreement of 12th ~Babi~ath- 1^nrT542, we sent protest to High Comissioner on '9th liibi-al-av/al. High Commissioner neglected to reply to this protest, but replied only to our first protest regarding movement of Shamar from Mesopotamia^ to Syria. He said as it was intention of Mesopotamian Government to prevent movement of such raiders they had established posts near Nejd frontier. The number of fortresses is mentioned in his letuer of April 20th, 9663, which we received in August 1927. You can see these fortified posts are far from the road hy i which refugees had gone to Syria. The N.jdis saw posts are erected only as a provocation.

King Abdul Aziz, to the Hon'ble the FoUtical Resi dent in the Fersian Gulf, We regret the action of the Iraq Government in these days which is a breach of the agreements entered into between us and them for the preserva tion of peace and order between the two countries. We see in each incident that takes place between us and them a pi^oof that it was not done with good intention by the Iraq Government and I give in detail a number of recent incidents from which you can understand the real situation between us both. The Shammar tribes who took refuge in Iraq used to raid on the Nejd frontier and we have protested against such raids at that time. I do not want to repeat in full the details of what happened. After some time the High Commissioner for Iraq warned us that a party of Shammar had left Iraq and Were gathering in the Syrian desert with the intention of raiding our tribes in our country Nejd. This was about the month of November last year. We took this action to be contrary to the agreements for the prevention of raids as the raiding tribe cannot tnter our territory without entering either the boundaries of Trans-Jordania or Iraq. We protested against the Iraq Govern ment for allowing this and asked for the prevention of such incidents. But the High Commissioner for Iraq kept quiet and did not reply to our protest at all. However, after ten months of our protest the Iraq Government began to build military stations near the wells and places near the frontier and spread a rumour that they were going to join up those places by railway lines and will then make them strong military fortresses on our bound aries, whereas Article III of Uqair protocol of 12th Habi II, 1341, does not allow any building at the wells and stations near the fron tier. We protested against this action which had the worst effect among the Nejd tribes and caused undescribable excitement and rage. We sent our above mentioned protest, to the High Commissioner for Iraq on 9th Eabi I, 1346, but the High Commissioner neglected to reply to this protest of ours and replied only to our first protest against the egress of the Shammar from Iraq to Syria with the intention of raiding our country. He said that as it is the intention of the Iraq Government to take precautions for the prevention of the going out of such raiders they have established them {i.e. posts) on the frontier adjoining Nejd territory which, as you can see, are far from the road from which the runaway have come to Syria and has no relation with that (road). The number of fortresses has been mentioned in his letter which ve received in August 1927, No. 9963, while the erection of such fortresses is forbidden in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. ^ -^-1^ the Nejd people have seen that they were erected for the purpose of causing discord and2 harm. Again we wrote 10 the High Commissioner repeating onr protest agaiiist the action of the Iraq Government on the 24th Habi I, 1346, and explained to His Excellency in that letter the degree in which the erection of such buildings and stations is contrary to the previous agreement and the excite ment and disturbance which this action caused at Nejd but we did not receive a reply to our letter. But on reaching our Jsejd capital (Riyadh) we saw clearly the extreme agitation and rage among our tribes living near the frontier, on account of that action. I found that the situation has become very critical so that it was very difficult to keep order on the excited frontier. Again we wrote to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq from Eiyadh on 10th Jamad 1346 informing him of the state of affairs, and I followed this with another letter on 12th Jamad I 1346, but although we did this no reply came from the High Commissioner to all our repeated protests and we could not see any good reason for this keeping quiet. The longer the silence lasted the more critical became the situation and the more the disquietude increased and it became more difficult to deal with it or rather it became impossible to preserve peace and order on the frontier between us and them. I have written this to you on account of your proximity to us, with the request that you will communicate to the British Government our strongest protest against the action of the Iraq Government, as we want to preserve peace and friendly relations between us and the British Government. The Iraq Gov ernment will be responsible for anything which occurs. Enclo. 2 of Serial No. (80).

And is that building a breach of this article or not ? . I ^ the y ( Ir aq) pretend that this breach was in our interest for prevent ing raiders from raiding us the JNajdis consider such sort of a building as a breach of their treaties and precisely the road that leads trouble to them ineretore I can see only two clear methods of meeting the situation, either the aboyementioned article is considered in force in which case the buildino-s erected should be removed and Busaiyah should be the first of them as they a?e contrary to the provisions of the said article or this article is not to be carried out and the forts built are not removed in which case the treaties with the Iraq (jovernment will all be considered cancelled, for which we shall feel very sorry for the obstinacy which the Iraq Government display. We still repeat our protest against the breach of that article and ask for the removal of the uildings which have been erected at the earliest date in compliance with the undertakings in the interests ^ of order and as a precaution against troubles which arise on account of letting matters lapse and become critical at the trontier as we have explained in our previous letters to His Excellency the; High Commissioner on the subject* Usual ending.6 Enclosure XIII of Serial No. (98). T ranslation or letter erom H. M. K ing A bdul A ziz bin S attd, to the P olitical A gent , B ahrain , N o . M-3-M.-3—27, dated 12 th J amad al T hani 3346, j.j ?., 7 th D ecember 1927. After compliments. We are in receipt of your letter No. 128-0. of 22iid Jamad al Awal 1346 conveying a message sent by the Hon'ble the Political Resident to us, in which he states that H. B. M.'s Government were astonished at the recent incident at Busaiyah. We request you to telegraph to him (the Political Resident) that we were more astonished and regret very much its occurrence. We have issued orders for enquiries about the people who had done it and for their punishment. At the same time we have issued orders for a stricter watch on the frontier and have taken all the necessary steps to prevent any further action until the end of the correspondence regarding this evil omened fort which has been erected only for purposes of intrigue and for causing troubles. As regards the compensation referred to in the letter it is a trifling thing winch is not worthy of causing a dispute between us and the British Government. But before discussing this matter we want to invite the attention of the just British Government to the matter of the responsibility and on whom it falls m this case, whether on us or the Iraq Government ? A second thing—This case should be compared with the others like it which have taken plaee between Iraq, Trans-Jordina and Nejd and Hejaz. For when the responsibility is faced and the matter is compared with the previous incidents the compensation can be fixed. We—and we believe that the justice of the British Government will support us—see that the responsibility falls on the Iraq Government as they alone had caused this incident. We have already warned the Iraq Govern ment of the bad results which may fallow on their behaviour towards us. But the only reply was silence or procrastination or lame explanations. The Hon'ble the Political Resident on referring to our letter of 30th Jamad-al-Awal 13l6—25th November 1927 will observe the difficulties and troubles which the Iraq Government have caused and are causing to give rise to a dispute between us and themselves and in addition to that to cause trouble between us and the British Government. When one looks at all the actions of the Iraqi Government towards us one will not see that they are the actions of a friendly neighbour to one in treaty with them but the spirit of an enemy will be seen and rather you can say that they are a breach of the spirit of peace. I give in detail a chain of actions done by them (Imq) in these days from which you can understand their real situation and it will make clearer to H. B. M's. Government the responsibility for che recent incidents 1. The High Commissioner for Iraq warned us that a raiding party of Sham mar were collecting in Syria to raid our country and that the Iraq Government were not responsible for their action. I protested as the raiders were bound to pass on their way to our country either through the territory of Trans-Jordania or Iraq and asked that the responsibility of the same may be borne either by the Iraq Government or Trans-Jordania but the reply was as I have informed the Hon'ble the Political Resident in my abovementioned letter—a silence for about 10 months without a reply. Then came a reply but in a very strange way as he made our protest a means of breaking the pro tocol entered into at Ujair with the Iraq by building a number of forts for our protection and for preventing raiders from raiding us. The Nejd people would be pleased if the Iraqis raided them every morning and evening but they do not agree to the building of one metre on the waters and the places on which building has been prohibited by an official document. These places are visited by them and are their watering places as well as places of visit and watering for others than them. Trouble broke out in Nejd ^ on account of this building in the manner I described to the Hon'ble the political Resident.i 2. Tho Iraq GroyernniBiit W6r6 not satisfied with, this sort of breach but began to interfere with the chiefs of our tribes and called them to attend its meetings (conferences). This is totally prohibited by the provisions of the treaties entered into at Ujair and Bahrah. An example of this is a letter from the Mutassarrif of Divaniyah to Mahammed-al-Turki bin Mijlad and Jaza bin Mijlad asking them to look into the claims relating to the plunder of the tribes. We have protested against this action in a letter which we send to the High Commissioner for Iraq, dated the 1st Eabi^al-Awal 1346 but no reply has been received from the High Commissioner up to this hour and we cannot understand the cause for this neglect. 8. The motor cars of the Iraq Government officials and also some aero - planes are always going as far the frontier and mix with our Arabs. This is dune with the intention of having an effect on our tribesmen either to per suade them to commit an act which will cause dissension between neighbours or for some other reason of which we cannot see the justification. 4. Those who study some of the Iraq newspapers especially the papers connected with the High officials of the Iraq Goverment will see from the attacks and insult against us and our Government show indications of the amount of hatred and hidden (bad) feeling. Prom this you will see that the Iraq Government have broken our treaty first by allowing her officials to communicate with our subjects and by allowing their officials to visit our country with their motor cars among our tribes to cause sedition and have broken their promise by building these posts the building of which is not permissible and have shown in their newspapers a condition that leads to the kindling of the flame of enmity between the two countries. Who then will be responsible for all this for the incidents which may be caused by some of those people whose feelings have been roused. They have seen their self- respect dishonoured, their treaties broken and their neighbour waiting for his chance inside those buildings. They went without the consent of the Government. J prevented the Nejd people totally from raiding from the datt; we entered into treaty for the prevention of the raids and have held them with an iron grip. But raids on us have never been discontinued either by the Iraq or by Trans-Jordania. The Nejd people obeyed us w r ith much patience in being prevented as they were respecting the undertaking we have taken to stop raids. But I had no excuse to put before them about this evil omened building. As they had seen the provision of the treaties which prevent such building and that we have prevented them from building such post in similar stations within our territory. We warned the British Government to look wath justice on this case then they will see that we are the people who comply wdth our undertaking and preserve what belong to others. Usual ending. iclo.

Faisal al Danish, leader of Mutair, crDssed Meeppotamian frontier about December 22nd in considerable force near Jokah. and raided Mesopotamian sliepherd tribes and some Shammar of Nejd temporarily in Mesopotamia committing heavy slaughter. He then moved North-West to attack Dahamshah, outlying portion of Anizeh tribe, who fled before him. All Mesopotamian desert tribes in extreme panic while there are rumours of contemplated attacks by other portions of Faisal al Dawish's tribe in South. Meanwhile there is unconfirmed report that Ibn Saud's forces have seized Mutair headquarters, Artawayah, having previously ordered Governor of Hail to pursue Faisal ad Dawish. Recent events as follows On November 5th Mutair destroyed Busaiyah fort and killed police and workmen. At end of November they raided Jahra in Kuwait. On December 9th same tribe attack- -ed Mesopotamian Shepherd tribes in neutral zone and few hours later fired on aeroplane, wounded one of personnel and damaged all machine armour. Mesopotamian casualties 59 men and 7,500 animals. On December 22nd occurred raid reported above. British officers in areas affected state that they are placed in most humiliating position. Chiefs of Mesopotamian desert tribes are openly declaring that they must become Akhwan as British and Mesopotamian Governments cannot protect them, are paying dues to Faisal al Dawish's tax collectors and some have put on Akhwan head dress in presence- i k ?J.C. ^ ZcTl presence of British officer, denouncing British Government to his face. Anizeh tribe, which stretches north across desert Irouue, is bound ultimately to follow unless Alchwan are checked and events are leading to situation which will force me to advise that projected pipe line and desert railway shall follow northern route through Syria,as our chief argument for southern line, namely greater security, is disappearing. Meanwhile Political circles in Baghdad and King Faisal are much excited and tendency already perceptible is bound to revive towards accusing us of conniving at attacks by Akhwan tribes in order to remind Mesopotamia of its depend ence upon British. This may undo excellent effect hitherto apparent, of London negotiations with King Faisal, whose attitude since his return has been admirable. Meanwhile Ibn Saud in answer to protests has stated Mutair have acted against his orders and that he intends to punish them but that Mesopotamia and British are respons- -ible for hostility of Mutair as they have fortified desert posts and patrolled desert with aeroplanes and armoured cars. This argument is obviously unsustainable. I consider our policy should depend upon whether Ibn Saud in next few weeks shows himself really deter- -mined to suppress attacking tribes and capable of doing so. If he fails in either respect I see no remedy except to blockade Hasa ports and force minor Trucial Chiefs on Arab side of Gulf to follow suit, on ground that we see no hope of preventing attacks except by threatening Akhwan tribes o into starvation and forcing them to resist Ibn Saud . King Faisal argues with some show of reason that Mutair must be assured of Ibn Saud's quiescence and inability to punish them severely otherwise they would never have been so mad as to leave their headquarters, families and property undefended behind them. message I suggest urgent BisxxjmgBX be now sent to Ibn Saud recapitulating series of raids both on Mesopotamia and ^ Kuwait, exposing futility of his arguments about fortification and2^ 1(O j and defence measures in desert and informing him that H.lPs. Government expect him to demonstrate to their satisfaction within six weeks that he is willing and able to punish Mutair trihe and extract compensation from them, failing which they will be compelled to resort to blockade of Hasa ports, stop supplies through other ports and (take) any other measures which may appear possible to them for the purpose of forcing his tribes to behave themselves. it is very difficult for aeroplanes to deal with present situation because of immense distance from air bases at which raiders operate, and delay in receiving inform- -ation of raids. I trust I may receive very early reply as Mesopotamian tribes are in grave danger and opinion here is restive and might force Mesopotamian Government into ill- -advised action if we do not act promptly. Supplies to Akhwan tribes are already being stopped from all Mesopotamian trading centres. Am unable to consult Air Officer Commanding, who is absent in Amman. HIGH COMMISSIONER.Telegram P.

Enclosure in No. 1. Jeddah Report for the period October 1 to October 31, 1926. DURING the period under review the steamships which tramp the Red Sea ave not tailed to disembark at Jeddah the one or two interesting oddities who appear to visit the mournful shores of the Hejaz at regular periods in the quiet interval between pilgrim seasons. The first to arrive was a certain Ahmed Zaky Pasha, coming from the Yemen. t? i ^ a ky Pasha is an old Egyptian ex-official of garrulous habits and -baistaman port, who recently made a trip to Sanaa in order to collect for the Moslem press whatever notes on subjects of geographical or historical interest he could pick up mere. He at the same time imposed on himself, which was more important, a mission of mediation between the Imam Yahya and Ibn Saud. With neither prince did he have any measure of success. It is rather like the case of Colonel House I ogether with his companion, Nabieh Bey-el-Azmeh, a Syrian of Egypt, the pasha has now returned to the comforts of Egypt, having accomplished nothing, but declaring that strife between the two rulers of the Jazirat-el-Arab would inevitably end m the weakening of Islam. It had been hoped that Ibn Saud would be induced to appoint Nabieh Bey-el-Azmeh as his agent in Sanaa for conversations ^ itii the Imam, The King, however, thinks that no useful purpose would be served by such an appointment. 3. Another traveller to the Hejaz has been a certain Dr. Wolfgang von Weisl who landed with an unkempt beard and Arab head-dress, but who turned out to te a Palestinian journalist from Tel Aviv. He had with him the works of Doughty Burton and Philby and declared his intention of exploring the obscured Nefdian oases which Mr Philby m his investigations had not been able to cover. He was not, of course, allowed to proceed, and I doubt whether he came to the point of askinsr P e r '' mis f lon - , But he dld g et an interview with Ibn Saud, in the course the Imam 3 7 made an mterestin g declaration of his policy with regard to 4. ' I have no particular quarrel,' he said, ' with the Imam Yahya and I am at peace with him. On the other hand, I have nothing specially in common with onhr' r f 61118 t0 that Asir is ^ useful buffer between us. But that is not the tatL tifu ^ W t 0 j ee continue to exist. The Idrisi is my son and has f l' ™ shelter under my shadow. I cannot for that reason sit still and see Sabia and t t swallowed by the Imam. I shall be forced to take action if the Imam attempts to take those two places. I am strong, and I have troops.'' attempts of what Ibn Sarid eVery chance l , 1 of bein g an accurate account 01 wnat ibn baud actually said. It seems reasonable to suppose that Ibn Sand has far too much to do in his own dominions to desire war P agLnst any of ht neighbours. It is no easy task to control Nejd, with its vast frontiers and unrulv S ho T ' b0th • !, d a , n d migratory, and the Hejaz, with the mass of thorny these parp C0n0mi ^ n ^ Ji? gl0ll - S ( l uestlons inherited along with its sovereignty To ese cares are added the anxiety of making the next piWimag-e a DolitiVnl anrl nancial success, the question of relations with the outside Moslem world and with [1479 d—11 J Tfthe Christian Powers. It is most unlikely that, with this burden to bear, confused by a worthless and ever-changing entourage, Ibn Saud is himself meditating bringing help to the Syrian Nationalists, as the French seemed to fear some months ago, or is eager to measure his strength with that of the Imam Yahya. 6. There is confirmation of this in a conversation which a close friend of Ibn Saud and a man of moderate opinions had a day or two ago with a member of the staff of this agency. Ibn Saud, this informant said, had no illusions about affairs in the Arab peninsula. Between its sovereigns no fundamental harmony was possible, for it was their nature each to seize any opportunity of crushing another. But Ibn Saud did not view the rumours about the Imam's hostile intentions towards him with much concern. Not one of the Arab princes was at liberty, or had the power to' attack another. The Imam, for example, had internal troubles in the Yemen, where rivals were working against him. Two of the Zeidi sheikhs sub ordinate to him were, one openly, one secretly, aspiring to the imamate, and these pretenders were attempting to induce Ibn Saud to help them; apart from that, some of the Zeidi tribes were refractory. Again, the Imam had the British Government against him. He had the Idrisi still to count with. The Idnsi was not dead, he had fighting men still at his call, and if he could be helped with arms and ammunition he could still give the Imam something to ponder over. Lastly, the Imam was so miserly that he would think twice before pouring out his gold to no purpose. 7. There may have been an indirect appeal in this conversation. However, its chief importance is that, in conjunction with the statement made to von Weisl, it provides a basis for building up a theory of Ibn Saud s attitude towards the Imam. That attitude might very reasonably be as follows : Ibn Saud has no particular sympathy for the Imam, and feels that the Imam is not particularly friendly to himself. Some day it may come to a trial of strength between them. If a connict came, Ibn Saud is in quite as good a position as his rival. Each has worries at home which should make for peace. But if the Imam wants to throw down a challenge, let him try to absorb what is left of Asir. Should he take that line, the present policy of indifference assumed by Ibn Saud might have to be revised. Let the Imam think well over his situation before antagonising the British on one side and Ibn Saud on the other. 8. Meanwhile, it is reported that 2,000 troops have been sent recently to the southern frontier posts. But, as if to prove that he has no hostile intention at present against the Imam, Ibn Saud has gone on his long-promised tour to Medina, for which he professes a love ' like that of the Prophet. ' His Majesty seems to dislike heartily the climate of Mecca and Jeddah, and his remarks suggest nostalgia for the drier air of the desert uplands of Nejd. He spent a week m Jeddah on the way, and it is considered here that, now the King has finally gone, his absence will be a long one. He himself speaks of an absence of some months. After his stay in Medina, he may extend his tour to Nejd and perhaps Riyadh, which he has not seen for a year and a half. 9. On contact with Ibn Saud it is impossible not to admire the King's fairness, his shrewdness and his frank simplicity. The pity is that he has not found counsellors to help him in a task of government for which one man alone is physically incapable. Personal greed and private jealousies are no less present round Ibn Saud than they were round King Ali. I have mentioned this fact at this point because it may possibly have a bearing on His Majesty's momentary attitude towards Iraq and Transjordan. Against both he expresses himself in terms of irritation. He seems at present to feel that he got the worst of the Bahra and Hadda Agreements and that they fetter him, while they have not reduced trouble on the frontiers. As far as raiding during the last six months goes, he feels that his tribesmen are on the credit side, and claims that if he had not restrained them they would have balanced the account long ago. 10. He appears to have been specially disappointed by the break-up of the conference at Ma'an between his representative and those of Transjordan, to which reference was made in the last Jeddah report, paragraph 13. Indeed, the failure of that meeting seems momentarily to have spoilt the pitch for future meetings of the Hadda tribunal, which was founded to settle such disputes. However, when it has been made clear to the King that the failure of the meeting w T as entirely due to the preposterous behaviour of two persons who attended as semi-official Nejd delegates, his faith in tribunals may revive. The present task of this agency will be to reassure him that the British officials in Transjordan take the tribunal as a serious matter, and will not brook external interferences with its proceedings.11. For Ibn Saud suggests that the raid annoyance he is so restless about is connived at, if not instigated, by the Emir Abdullah and King Feisal, or their partisans. One reminds him when he refers to this conception that there are British authorities in both Transjordan and Iraq whose duty and interest it is to prevent any such encouragement of tribal raids. But the idea sticks in his mind. Perhaps, from time to time, his traditional enmity to the Hashemite house manifests itself in this way. It is also possible that there are persons among his advisers whose interest it is to keep that animosity alight. 12. It is quite conceivable that the Syrians and pan-Arabs in Ibn Sand's entourage resent the existence of a Transj or dan-Iraq corridor of territory cutting off Nejd from any extension of her influence northward towards Syria. Ibn Saud himself, as has been argued above, is probably aware that he has too much to do at home to seek further expansion of his influence, at least for the present. It is on the other hand, less certain that some of his friends view affairs in such a common- sense light. Conceivably, these persons may one day try to exert their influence to induce the King to support Arab claims in Palestine. Against that contingency, however, can for the present be set the King's own good sense and his friendliness to Great Britain. 13. Besides, the royal counsellors are always changing. The last to be dismissed is Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Egyptian, who is leaving shortly, although up to the present he has been one of the King's most valued advisers, former Governor of Mecca, a man at least of some experience, and in religious affairs an influence towards moderation. He leaves denouncing the Syrians whose advice the King takes—Sheikh E-ashid Riza, editor of the Egyptian paper, the 'Minar,' Sheikh Kamel-el-Qassab, Hassan Wafqi Bey, Director of Police, and Sheikh Yussef Yasin—and praying devoutly that they will lead the King into no hare-brained adventures or ambitions. He is going by way of India to Koweit, where he has relatives, and where, if there are any outstanding matters between Nejd and Iraq, he will act for Ibn Saud. 14. The status of the newly-arrived Turkish representative has now been announced as diplomatic representative of the Turkish Republic^ which presumably implies formal recognition of Ibn Saud. His oflice is styled a Legation, and he has taken precedence over the rest of the foreign agents in Jeddah. On presenting his papers to His Majesty the King, Shevket Bey recalled the old associations, based on brotherhood and co-operation, which formerly existed between Turks and Arabs, and said he hoped that such noble memories would find new expression in the revived friendship between the two Governments. It must be conceded that the new Minister had a diflicult job on hand when he recalled the past, and perhaps took the simplest way out of the dilemma by deliberate misrepresentation. In speaking about present relations he was on surer ground. His private views are distinctly contrary, nevertheless, to his public platitudes. He considers the country savage and its inhabitants nothing less than barbarians, and laments the evil day that brought him to the Hejaz. He can have little routine work to do here, and spends most of his time paying calls or humbly fishing from the coral reefs. One can only suppose that his Government's purpose in sending him to the Hejaz was to please the older-fashioned people in Turkey, or else to mark the Turkish Government's interest in the nebulous schemes of Islamic unity which are floating around the world. There is some talk of a treaty of friendship between the Turks and Ibn Saud. 15. Ibn Saud has been pleased by the reception given to his son in Great Britain. He has not personally mentioned the question of the Emir Eeisal's failure to open the Ahmadiya mosque at Southflelds, but an article in the official newspaper Umm-el-Kura ' defined his position in the matter, and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, in a conversation, has confirmed it. Proposals for Feisal's opening of the mosque were begun months ago, and no objections were raised. When, however, the prince arrived in England, the Egyptian newspapers began to discuss the propriety of his performing the ceremony, and to write that the mosque would be used by Moslems, Christians and Jews alike—a temple, in fact, for all religions. Thereupon Ibn Saud instructed his son to decline the invitation. But these instructions brought telegrams from London and India, pointing out the harmless nature of the sect, the orthodoxy of the people using the mosque (Ahmadiyas are not prevented from making the Haj to Mecca), and the deplorable effect, as far as propaganda was concerned, of the King's refusal. Finally, Ibn Saud, pulled this way and that, telegraphed saying that Feisal must decide for himself what course to pursue. If the mosque was to be for all religions, as related by the Ahram ' [1479 d-1] • ' b 20) in a quotation from the 'Morning Post,' then the prince would have to decline; but if, after careful consultation with Moslems in London, it was ascertained that the mosque was for the different Moslem sects only, then the prince could use his discretion and perform the ceremony of opening. The attitude of Ibn Saud in this matter is quite reasonable. From the point of view of dogma, the Wahabis, most orthodox of Moslems in their own view, cannot consider the Ahmadiya sect as Orthodox any more than the Christian Church can consider Theosophists orthodox Christians. Ibn Saud is not a man of vast experience, and it is more than likely that what appeared to him in the first place to be a harmless ceremony took a more alarming aspect when he learnt that English clergy, not to mention the Mayor of Wandsworth, were to be present. One can as easily imagine a couple of cardinals being deputed to go down to Brindisi to greet Mrs. Besant and her young protege from Madras, as Tbn Saud blessing the foregathering of a son of his with latitudinarian curates in a London suburb. 16. The King gave some general views on foreign relations to the journalist mentioned above in paragraph 3. With regard to the Caliphate, Ibn Saud is reported as saying that he would not accept it under any consideration. The fourth requisite of a Caliph was that he should protect the Faithful throughout the world by his sword. He could not do that; no more could the King of Egypt do it. Could he intervene on behalf of the Moslems of Syria, or King Fuad protect the Moslems of Tripoli ? There was no Moslem prince strong enough to assume the protection of Islam throughout the wide world. Therefore, in the temporal sense, there could be no Caliph. What could be done was the formation of a kind of majlis of represen tatives of the Moslem Powers and peoples, which would take the Caliphate, as it were, into commission. As for a leader and an arbitrator in spiritual affairs, the Moslem world had already its Caliph—the Koran. 17. As regards Akaba and Ma'an, the King said that, if his interrogator would read the proceedings of the recent Islamic Conference, he would see that the question of that territory had been avoided. He for the present must observe a like discretion. It was a political question which was not yet solved. As for the Hejaz Railway, the King was willing to approach the problem of its ownership, beginning from the start made at the conference of Lausanne between Turkey and the Allied Powers, when preparatory arrangements for dealing with this problem were made, on the lines of which he himself was ready to begin negotiations. It will be realised that, as there are no means of checking the above account, it is quoted with reserve. 18. The rumours of an impending nationality law alluded to in the last Jeddah report were quickly followed up by the publication of the actual law on the subject. All ex-Ottoman subjects born or established in the Hejaz are declared Hejazis. This provision is reasonable, although it makes no mention of options for Palestinian, Transjordanian or Iraq nationality. But, in addition, all persons born in the Hejaz are proclaimed Hejazis, and every resident in the country not in possession of valid official documents proving his foreign nationality is considered a Hejazi. The two last provisions ignore pointedly any possible' capitulatory rights claimed by foreigners. 19. The different foreign representatives at Jeddah, in acknowledging receipt of the official communication of this law, stated that, until they had received instructions from their various Governments on the subject, they would have to reserve the rights of their nationals in respect of the law. The statute shows signs of a too hasty drafting. For instance, the son of a Persian consular officer born in Jeddah will be henceforward a Hejazi unless a provision is added to the contrary. But perhaps, after all, the authors of these rough-shod provisions merely consider them as the first step toward solving the intricate problem of nationality in this country. They may intend that finer details will be left for study when each Power interested defines its relations with the Hejaz. It has been suggested to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that at least children of foreigners, born in the country, should, when they reach years of discretion, be given the option of choosing between local nationality and that of their parents. Nothing so far has come of this suggestion. 20. It is difficult to see what will be the public utility of such drastic regula tions, except as a check to the freedom and numbers of foreign residents, with the protection by consuls implied. Nevertheless, very few expressions of alarm on the subject have reached this Agency. 21. The financial straits of the Government have been particularly poignant during October. The Treasury is literally living from hand to mouth, and there is every now and then a painful wait before the arrival of a vessel in port provides customs receipts. A business house in Jeddah which transacts for the Governmentpractically all its remittances of money to foreign countries (there being no banking facilities in the Hejaz) was asked to send a telegraphic remittance of £1,000 to the Emir Feisal in London. The Treasury had not got the £1,000, but promised to repay it in five days. To the astonishment of the firm concerned, repayment was made, in four days, but this commendable promptitude was counterbalanced by another request for a remittance of £1,000, which sum is still owing. The Govern ment has practically no credit. It appears to exist at present on forced loans, which are recuperated by the victims in various devious ways. Between the pilgrimage of one year and that of another come barren months when the bowels of the public Treasury rumble with emptiness. But, apart from the irregular flow of income into the country, there appears to be no system in expenditure. As funds come in, or, rather, before they come in, they are spent. The friends of Ibn Saud may well wish him strong and loyal counsellors. At present his loneliness seems almost tragic. 22. While the King was in Jeddah he asked for a new loan of £25,000 from the leading merchants of the place. It was said .at the time that the last loan of £13,000 had not yet been repaid, and that the King was so short of money that he would not be able to proceed to Medina before the steamship '' Alavi'' came in from Bombay. The latter proved to be an exaggeration, as is doubtless the rumour that the British Government has advanced £500,000 on the Jeddah customs ! However, pilgrim dues are to be higher next Haj. 23. The Sudan Government is desirous of regulating the pilgrim traffic between Suakin and Port Sudan, on the one hand, and the Holy Land, on the other, and is considering regulations by which the trip across the Red Sea will henceforward be made in special conditions which will ensure efficient quarantine and passport control. The local Government, for financial reasons, has willingly agreed to assist, and has promised to prevent such pilgrims landing surreptitiously from dhows on the coast, as well as to concentrate all disembarkation from Sudanese ports on Jeddah. The Nigerians and Sudanese who take this route are notoriously impecunious, and are not really welcome in a country which is only slightly better provided than they are. 24. Up to the present, under the Saudian regime, the duty and privilege of leading the prayers in the Haram at Mecca have fallen to a Wahabi imam. Dispositions are now being taken to broaden this arrangement, which has caused considerable annoyance throughout Islam, and has been a subject of discussion by the committee left behind in the Hejaz by the Islamic Conference. For the future, at each of the five prayers of the day, there will be one Jama'a (session) only, not two or three as heretofore. But there will be five imams, one each for the Hanafi, Shafi'i and Maliki sects, and two for the Wahabi (Hanbali) sect, and these will take duty in turn. The outcome of this will be that worshippers of all the sects of Islam, Wahabis included, will, as occasion dictates, have to pray behind an imam of another sect or miss that particular prayer. This change, in the liberal sense, corresponds with the replacement of the chief imam at Mecca, Sheikh Abdullah-bin- Hassan, the zealot who had an Egyptian chauffeur whipped for smoking, as described in a previous report, and who has left for Medina. His place is taken by an Egyptian sheikh named Abdul Dhar, whose reputation is less fanatic. The latter, at the Friday prayers last week, urged Moslems to forget their sects and to unite. 25. Seven hundred destitute African pilgrims have been repatriated during the month, as have also five slaves. NORMAN MAYERS. oTelegram P. From Political Agent, Kuwait, Resident, Bushire.
