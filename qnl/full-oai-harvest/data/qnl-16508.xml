The first enclosure is a copy of a letter, dated 12 June 1853, from Lieutenant Robert Anstice Stradling, Commander of the HC schooner
                           Constance, containing information from the lower part of the Gulf. In this letter, Stradling recounts his recent meeting with His Highness Syed Theweeny at Muscat [Sayyid Thuwaynī bin Sa‘id al-Sa‘id], regarding the tribute paid by the latter to Abdullah ben Fyzul [Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah Āl Sa‘ūd, ruler of the Second Saudi State]. Stradling relays intelligence obtained from the Agent at Sharja [Sharjah], Hadji Yacoob, which includes information on the landing of large numbers of slaves, both at Ras-el-Khyma [Ra's al-Khaymah] and at Amalgawein [Umm al-Qaywayn]. In addition, Stradling relays information received from the Agent at Lingah [Bandar-e Lengeh], stating that a boat belonging to Syed ben Raschid, brother of Abdullah ben Raschid of Amalgawein, has reportedly been landed at Sharja with 240 slaves on board. Stradling gives details of other boats carrying slaves having been seized at Lingah. He states that he believes that the Shaikh of Lingah is awaiting the Resident's instructions on the disposal of the slaves. This letter is followed by a blank page. The second enclosure, which appears on the verso of folio 37, is a copy of a letter in Arabic, addressed to Sayyid Thuwaynī bin Sa‘id al-Sa‘id, from the people of Najd.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673709.0x00001c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
