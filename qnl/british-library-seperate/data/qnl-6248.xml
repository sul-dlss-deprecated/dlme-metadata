Summaries from January 1925 to July 1925 cover fortnightly rather than monthly periods. The summaries were compiled by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Prescott Trevor, Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Stuart George Knox, Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Beville Prideaux, and Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Gilbert Crosthwaite, respectively).The summaries cover areas in Persia [Iran] including: Mohammerah [Khorramshahr], Dizful [Dezful], Ahwaz [Ahvāz], Ispahan (Isfahan), Shiraz, Behbehan [Behbahān], Bushire, Bunder Abbas [Bandar Abbas], Kerman, Mekran [Makran], Shushtar, Bakhtiari, and Lingah. They also cover Muscat, the Trucial Coast, Bahrain, and Kuwait.The summaries cover various subjects, including: movements of British officials, Persian Officials, non-officials, and foreigners; health; Persian ports; arms traffic; military affairs; the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; the Shaikh of Mohammerah; and roads.The volume includes a divider which gives the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military affairs</topic></subject><subject><topic>Health</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Mohammerah</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Roads</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms traffic</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000369#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000369#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
