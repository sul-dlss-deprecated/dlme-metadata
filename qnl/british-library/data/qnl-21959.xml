Chase, Air Liaison Cfficer, Bahrain, informed me on the 16th of November that Iviajor- General Smith of the United States Army, who I understand is concerned with the American Transport Corps, was arriving that afternoon. Sq./Ldr. Chase had no idea of the purpose of the General’s visit but thought it would have something to do with Oil Company matters. This is the fourth General Officer of United States Army who has visited Bahrain during the las^ V-a or three weeks; the others being Ma*)or-General Somerville, Major-General Connolly and Major-General Royce. Major-General Smith duly arrived and stayed the night • I..;.'! . with the Bahrain Petroleum Company an^ to Dhahran the following day where he was the guest of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. Me returned to Bahrain on the evening of the 17th and left for Abadan(?) on the morning of the 18th. 2. At about 7 p.m. on the 17th, the Air Liaison Officer telephoned to me and said that he would like to come and see me for a few minutes. He duly came and gave me the gist of conversations which it transpired that he had had with a lUi* Major Reycc who had accompanied Major-General Smith. The talks with this American Army officer were of a semi-official nature and were designed to discover what would be needed to carry out the American Re-inforcement Plan an! to what extent the Boyal Air Force could meet the American requirements. The Air Liaison Officer told me that the three most important points were:- (a) A pipe line from the middle of the causeway linking Manamah with Maharraq to the fuel tank on the latter Island. (b) The erection of accommodation for permanent and transit American personnel. (c) The erection of an American wireless installation, purely for use with aircraft.T 7 g. 1/ I understood that (a) was necessitated by the fact that the swing bridge on the causeway could only carry a load of five tons and that the petrol tank lorries which were to be used to bring the petrol from the bulk storage at Sitrah to Maharrq weighed, when full, something in the neighbourhood of 20 tons, (b) - accefamodation would not be available in the Moyal Air Force Linos and that it would be essential to construct huts for the Americans, probably of pre-fabrieated materials, and (e) - that the Americans would have their own wireless installation owing to the Hoyal Air Force Wireless already having as much work as it could be expected to deal with. 3. In reply to a question from me the Air Liaison Officer informed me that he had already spoken to the Adviser and obtained what he describe 1 '! his un-official approval on behalf of the Bahrain Government. Me saw the Adviser on his way to fciaharraq aerodrome about 3 p.m. on the 17th and again met him the same evening. I understand that neither meeting was by appointment but both appear to have been completely accidental. The Air Lia,ison Officer mentioned that he had (IceX telephoned to Major ye q ^fter his conversations with Mr. Belgrave and that he had told him that he had sounded the Bahrain Government unofficially and did not expect that they would have any objection to the proposals. 4. I informed the Air Liaison Officer that it was clearly wrong of him to have ted any direct communication whtsoever with the Bahrain Government on an important matter like this, and that he most undoubtedly should have approached me in the first instance. I pointed out to him tlg^by going direct to the Adviser and then informing Major Reycn of the result of his QonverVjt*kia?, however un-offieial it might have been, he may have very g*a*iously handicapped us in our future dealings with the -United States authorities in regard to the present proposal. /Thei 3 The Air Liaison Officer said that he was exti’emely sorry for what had occurred and that it had been his intention to see me first but the purely chance meetings with the Adviser had seemed to offer a good opportunity of mentioning the sub ject there and then. 5. In regard to our attitude towards this proposed American ’invasion* I told the Air Liaison Officer that, subject to 5 s f confirmation by Sir Geoffrey Prior the Mon’ble the Political ; I ' . i ■ : | | , J Resident in the Persian Gulf, it was my opinion that there ' ■ - , r „ ^ 1111 i should be no direct dealing between the Bahrain Government i and the American Army authorities or if possible between them and the Political Agent. I would prefer to see them essential -ly a part of the Hoyal Air Force organization in much the same position as the present 'Staging Post' on llaharraq Island, for they will merely be a staging post for American aircraft. ' - ; 11 ? I I also said that I would prefer that their dealings with the Political Authorities should be through the Senior Royal Air Force Officer on the station who would presumably be the Station Commander and that there should not be any question of land being leased to the American Army authorities but that they should be accommodated on land already leased or to be leased to the Royal Air Force. The Air Liaison Officer said that he would convey my views to Air Vice Marshal R.P. Willoek, C.B., who was expected to arrive on the 19th of November, en-route to Aden where he was to confer with the Air Officer Commanding Ceylon and the Air Officer Commanding Aden. 6. On his arrival Air Vico Marshal WillOck who was accom panied by Group Captain Alexander, Group Captain Brown, Colonel Clements and Wing Commander Kirk, asked me through the Air Liaison Officer to go round in the evening and see him. There was no mention of any official meeting and so I was somewhat surprised on my arrival at the Air Liaison Officer*s house to find what amounted to a serious conference in progress and Mr. Lloyd Tayloxjthe Regional Manager of the British Overseas Airways Corporation in attendance.4. 7* It seemed that the Air Vice-Marshal had taken strong exception to the Air Liaison Officer’s action in having agreed to so many arrangements with the American Transport Corps’ representative. In this connection please see the attached 'private” copy of the Air Liaison Officer’s report to his superiors. The Air Vice-Marshal stated that it was necessary to be most careful when dealing with the American Transport • V - ■ : y;; :: ■/' &gt; ^ Corps and always to bear in mind that the senior officers of that Corps were in peace time the most brilliant executives of the American Civil Av^iation companies. The Air Vice- Marshal went on to poiht out that the whole scheme would hove to be considered very carefully and that any attempt to hustle the Royal Air Force into granting facilities, which might be unnecessary and which they might later regret must be guarded against. He then turned to me and said that he felt that if the Americans did come here, he thought that all dealings with the Political authorities should be through the Royal Air Force and that there should be no direct communication with the Bahrain Government. I told him that I was in entire agreement and I went on to say that I thought the American Transport Corps should be considered as nothing more than 'temporary tenants' of the Royal Air Force and that there should be no question of their acquiring leases of land or carrying out any work of their own. Such construction as would have to be carried out to provide accommodation for them should be done by or through the Royal Air Force, such re-fuelling arrangements as were necessary should be done by the Royal Air Force, and nothing should be done wbieh would give the American Government even the most imaginary right to any permanent facilities in Bahrain. The Air Vice-Marshal said that he was in agreement. 8. There was some discussion regarding the pipe line which the Air Liaison Officer and Major Royee*proposed should be ru across the causeway. I said that I did not like the idea at /allall beeause I fait that there was serious danger of fire and that traffic on a busy highway would undoubtedly be obstrueted by large tank lorries carrying fuel to the pumping station which was to be sited two-third of the way across the eause-waj I did not approve of the idea of the line being in close proximity to the town and suggested that the possibility of moving the petrol by barge from Sitra to the South of Maharraq town and from there by pipe-line to the aerodrome should be considered. Colonel Clements, who is the Chief Engineer at Air Headquarters, Hnbbaniya, said that he agreed and would mucl prefer to see the line moved, both for the reasons I had . stated and also because damage to the causeway would dis- aireraft. He said that he would prefer to have a small jetty extending into the sea somewhere to the soubh of Maharraq town possibly supporting an above-water pipe and that the petrol should be pumped from the barge direct to the re-fuelling tank on the landing ground. 9. There was no further conversation on the main topic but 1 learnt from Mr. Lloyd Taylor that the British Overseas Airways Corporation were suspending their services along the South Arabian route and that this was being done against his advice. The Air Vice-Marshal said thcat it was a great pity they were to suspend the Services especially in view of the fact that the Americans were flying twelve aircraft in each direction each day. I also heard that it was proposed to re-arm No.244 Squadron at Sharjah and that the Squadron Headquarters would probably be moving to Masira leaving a flight only at Sharjah. I further learnt that it was just possible that our American friends would be utilising Sharjah as a re-fuelling station. organize the petrol supplies both to our own and to American /A 20-11-43.SECRET Political Agency, Bahrain, 20th November 1943 I have heard that it is possible that the American Transport Corps may wish to utilise Sharjah Royal Air Force aerodrome for' re-fuelling the aircraft passing through in accordance with their re-inforcement programme. 2. Will you please sound the Senior Royal Air Force Officer with a view to discovering whether he has had any conversations with any American officers on this subject and what the outcome of these conversations has been. 3. You should be extremely careful'to see that there are no direct dealings between the Americans and the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dubai. Any official business which they may desire to discuss should be referred to me at once and should they wish to pay an unofficial call on any of the Shaikhs you should make a point of being present and ensure that the call remains unofficial. 6^^^- 4. You should inform me immediately of any suggestion that the American Transport Corps proposes to erect buildings, make use of land, whether Royal Air Force or otherwise, or construct re-fuelling installations. In other words, I wish to be informed of every move before it is made. Captain M.P.O’C.

V Political KPfA SECRET ■■P From To EXPRESS LETTER Political Agent, Bahrain. Political Resident, Bushire. No.CAVSl Bahrain, 20th December 1943, SUBJECT: American Transport.Corps and air facilities on MaHjrraq Island. r Reference my note dated 20th November 1943. 2. I enclose a note of certain conversations between I representatives of the United States Forces and myself at which the Air Liaison Officer and Mr. R.M. Hadow the Assistant Political Agent were present. 3. I consider that all leases of land must be to the Royal Air Force and even then should be of a temporary nature that is for the duration of the war and a reasonable period afterwards, say six months. It is also desirable that buildings required to house Allied troops should be the property of the Royal Air Force and erected by our Services. 4. The question of whether or not the W/T installations her© and at Sharjah and the meteorological station at the latter place are necessary is a matter for the Royal Air Force experts to decide. Again I would prefer to see them installed by us but I am afraid this like the construction of the accommodation is, in the present state of our affairs, a vain hope. 5. The Air Liaison Officer has kept me fully informed and has faced a difficult situation with considerable skill. ft Political Agent, Bahrain. tjeNote on an interview with Colonel Lewis, and Major Van Nostrund of the United States Array and Squadron Leader W.A. Chase Royal Air Force Air Liaison Officer Bahrain at the Agency on the 19th of December 1943. Major Van Nostrund stated that he was on the staff of Major General Malloy commanding the North African Wing of the American Transport Corps and that Colonel Lewis represented Major General Connolly of the Iraq-Persia Command. I understood that these two gentlemen had arrived here on the 18th of December and proposed to leave on the 21st December and that they were accompanied by a staff of experts in engineering and signalling. They had had consultations with Squadron Leader Chase and examined the present Royal Air Force installations and had very right and properly been brought round to see me by him to explain their plans and intentions. 2 : .Major Van Nostrund sketched the general outline of the reinforcement programme, touched on the allotment to them of certain air-fields in North Africa, and dwelt on the magnitude of their programme. He is I believe a lawyer with political leanings in civil life. • He then traced the history of the project and laid his cards on the table as he termed it or at any rate as many of them as he thought fit to disclose. It seems that their the=fep reinforcement plan necessitates their having a permanent landing ground here which would be operated should Abadan become unserviceable and in addition to Abadan when their flov; of aircraft render it necessary^ and an emergency landing ground at Sharjah. 3. Permission has been applied for by General Malloy to make use of the Royal Air Force landing ground at Bahrain and to construct certain buildings but by the time Major Van Nostrund left Cairo ho answer had been received from the Air Ministry. He trusted that by the time he returned to Cairo^ which he hoped would be about the 24th of this month^sanction would have been received and they would be able to proceed /withwith their plans. They expected to commence work here by January 15th, 1944 and aimed to have the work completed by March 15th in ample time to commence operations by April 1st. 4. In Bahrain they proposed having a permanent establish ment of twenty officers and eighty enlisted men and accom modation for a transit population of hundred officers and hundred enlisted men. The permanent establishment wou^.d deal with the refuelling of aircraft, operational matters # and man a Radio Beacon and a Radio Transmitting and Radio Receiving station. 5. At Sharjah they proposed to install signalling and meteorological personnel numbering ten officers and forty enlisted men with a transit camp to house twentyfive officers and twentyfive enlisted men. It appeared that they would install a Radio Beacon of sorts and certain weather instru ments. 1 6. Major Van Nostrund considered that in Bahrain the present air-field would be ample for their needs and that their housing, recreational, and store buildings could be sited on land already leased to the Royal Air Force but the wireless installations would have to s be erected on land not yet leased to the Royal Air Force. The buildings would be constructed of local coral and though American engineers would supervise the work they would require approximately thousand coolies and seventyfive masons and carpenters if they were to complete their construction according to programme Major Van Nostrund made it clear that they proposed to undertake the construction work themselves simply because British Construction Units were already working to more than capacity and it was essential to complete the work in the shortest possible time. The work v/ould be done by the Persia-Iraq Command. The question of labour arose and I said that I feltn » o • sure that .the number of semi-skilled men required by them could not be found locally though in my opinion ample coolies would be forthcoming. I did not anticipate any opposition to semi-skilled labour being imported for the work provided (a) we were unable to produce the men locally, (b) the Bahrain Petroleum Company could not make men available temporarily, and (c) that they took them away again when their work was completed. I deprecated the importation of labour on principle and because the high wage rates that these men would expect and receive would disturb the local labour market. 7. Fuel storage installations would he required on Mahrraq i Island and they proposed to carry fuel by tank lorry from Sitra to the west side of the cause-way bridge and them pump the fuel via submarine pipe direct to the fuel storage tanks. I said I did not like the idea from a security point of view and would prefer to see the fuel brought by barge from Sitra direct to the south-west corner of Malirraq Isknd and thence i by pipe-line to the storage plant. 8. I was given to understand that the American Air Force detachment would be provisioned from outside and would either drink the local water or that they would erect a small distil lation plant similar to that now in use at Masira. They would also arrange their own medical facilities. 9. Major Van Nostrund asked me whether there would be any delay in their commencing operations from a political stand point. I replied that I should make an immediate report to Sir Geoffrey Prior the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and that when the Air Liaison Officer gave the details of * the areas on Mahrraq Island which the Royal Air Force might desire to lease in connection with the scheme I would make a further report. I should then await instructions and could not foretell how long it would be before they reached me but provided the India Office and the Air Ministry had approved the project I did not anticipate any protracted delay.I. 11 , ’ll 'Wlff 4. When I was instructed to proceed I should negotiate with the Bahrain Government for the sites required as additional areas to be leased to the Royal Air Force and it was improbable that any very considerable delay was to be anticipated. 10. Later the same evening I spoke to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government who agreed with my views about the actual negotiations for sites unless the sites required were on property not owned by the Bahrain Government in which event some difficulty might be anticipated with the ov/ners. I also had an opportunity of a few private words with the Air Liaison Officer who told me that Major Van Nostrund had sU £S es ted that the United States Air Force should be in opera tional control of the landing ground. The Air Liaison Officer objected most strongly and said that for a variety of reasons of a Service nature the Royal Air Force would undoubtedly retain operational control of the Air Port. 20th December 1943. . w *. t * T :zr~28/60 13 Telegram From To Political Agent, Bahrain No. * Dated a j_&gt;clIlX clxlx Political Resident, Bushire 864 20th December 1943. • Refer0ece my Jxpress Letter No. C/1781 dated December 20th. 2. ^ir Liaison Officer informed me today that Americans had reduced their labour demands and that he had informed them that he could carry out their construction programme with his present staff provi ded he was not., required to embark on an R.a.'R’. building programme.

(b) To haul from Tank 921 to a point approx. 100 yards West of the Bridge on the Causeway by means of Two 4,000 gallon road Tank Lorries. (o) To construct a small pier at this point on the Causeway on which the road tankers can discharge, (d) To install a pump connected to a pipe line (3' pipe to be supplied by the R,A.F.) at the pier to pump from road tank lorxy to bulk storage near the Airfield. (e) To lay a 3 W submarine pipe across the bay to the bulk tanks at Muharraq, (f) To install on a convenient site at Muharraq^Two 5,000 U.S. Barrel Tanks and the necessary Pumps and fittings to receive the fuel from the pipe-line , and the necessary discharge points to fill the Airfield refuelling units. (g) Should It prove practicable for the road tankers to cross the bridge, then the pipe-line would be eliminated and delivery effected direct tvaa Sitra to Muharraq storage by road tanker. 5. Major Rice remained long enough to introduce the U.S, A.T,C, Mission before Reaving for Abadan at midday on the 19 th Dec, 6 .

The matter ms then |eft until the results of the Engineer’s survey ooulA be examined. Munday f 20th was utilised by the Mission in completing their survey and in discuscions with BAPCO on other matters, until I ms able to ocnfe&amp;ct Major Van No&amp;trand at Awali after dinner that evening. The attached sketch was laid in front of me and discussed in terns of labour and local materials .and their eatimtea amount to (1) Coolie Labour 500 ( ii i Artisan 40 (ill) Coral 2800 cubic yards. Talks with Mr, iVnbrose (derk of Works) subsequent to the discussions referred to in paragraph 8. above, had led me to modify some what ay views on our capabilities on undertaking construction and, when I saw this sketch plan and learnt that they were considering construction in local material with local labour, I fcrnied the opinion that it would be possible, given certain conditions, for the R.A.F, to undertake such work — subject of course to sanction by higher authority. 12 * R.A.F. construction program©, as far is is known would not interfere with this work. The proposed work for the tl.S.A.T.C. would not entail a great increase in present supervisory and artisan staff , with one or two exceptions, it is anticipated that this could be met froa the local labour market. *3* In my statements above, the installation of the Bulk Fuel Scheme has not been considered, 14* ¥y views, were ocenunimted to Major Van Hostrand, and received, I thought, with misgiving, as he seemed doubtful whether our wganisaticn could handle this project to the tajgjet dates laid down which arej- Oocraenoe ccns true tier.

(a) It is stressed t&gt;iat to ensure corrpletion of canstnxotion to the target dates, it is essential tliat the necessary materials to be • supplied fran outside sources, such as Timber, cement, wiring, fittings etc. must be on site at the earliest possible moment for use the minute construction demands. (b) Clork Of Works assures me, that given immediate authority, sufficient coral could be obtained to complete construction without delay. This means the placing Immediately os’ orders with local, contractors to ensure a steady supply* This point was explained to Major Van Nostrand soarl who intimated that approved would be sought immediately he reached Cairo so that demands could be raised at once, thus assuring to whom carries out construction, an adequate supply of the principle local material required. (o) Consequent upon Major Van Nostrand’s and ny call on the Political Agent, I have had an opportunity of discussing with the Political Agent the relevant portions of his rej^ort to the Political Resident with which I am in complete agreement.

Bahrain Agency telegram No,892 dated the 29th December 1943, ' ♦ No. and date of Enclosure : Subject Note dated 30-12-43 on Air Vice4 Air Facilities in Bahrain Marshal A.C.Collier, C.B.,C.B.B;’s for U.S. A.T.C. visit to Bahrain. 1 .7/2 &amp; 28/50 Air Vice Liar shall R.P.Willock, C.B., and .Air Vice iarshtill A *0•Collier-, C*B*j C*3*K*, called 'to see me on / the evening of December 29th* Air Vice , r rsHc 1 A*C. Collier vias described as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Air Force Transport Command and he is at the moment on his way to India in con nection with the vast increase in the flow of aircraft from the Middle East to India which it is anticipated will very shortly c omxnenc e. Air Vice Marshal A.C* Collier thought that Bahrain would be a most important link in the chain and said that his survey party would be arriving in 4 or 5 days time. He anticipated that more building would have to take place and the re-fueling arrangements would have to be vastly improved. ! '-ith regard to the American A.T.C. he said that the policy was for the Royal Air Force to retain control of the landing ground but the American aircraft would be under the control of tlTeir own operational staff until they came with in short range of the landing ground. He said that Air Chief Marshal A.V. Tedder, ^.C.B., considered that the fear that was present in certain peoples 1 minds that the Americans would lay claim to air ports after the war which they had been using during the war on the grounds that they had either made them or erected and maintained buildings in their proximity was ridiculous. The Air Chief Marshal conssidered that the closest cooperation should be our object and that no thought of after the war competition should disturb our present relations with the United States Air Force. The Air Vice Marshal predicted that after the war by international agreement airfields will be made available in all countries with the possible exception of Russia for inter national use, that is to say, that every country would be entitled to use certain specified landing fields or airports in foreign countries but would only be permitted to take up passengers on condition/- 2 - condition that they Yvere not set dovfn in the same country. i asked the Air Vice Marshal what he considered Bahrain’s position would be after the war and he said that the best possible \ solution as far as \#e and the Shaikh were concerned would be for the Maharraq aerodrome to be under the control of the Air Ministry who would be responsible for all persons of whatever nationality making use of the ground. He considered that Bahrain would be one of the most important post-war alighting areas. 3. I told Air Vice Marshal Collier that I considered and I knew that the Hon’ble the Political Resident and Air Vice Marshal V/illock were in agreement with me, that any land required for American operations in Bahrain must be leased to the Royal Air Force and that it was desirable that any buildings &amp;c ., to be erected for American personnel should be built by the Royal Air rorce. X understood that the Royal Air Force could undertake the construction work for the United States Air Force although the provision of the radio installations might be at the moment beyond their power. The Air Vice Marshal agreed and suggested that Air Vice Marshal V/illock should telegraph to Air Chief Marshal A.W. Tedder, and make it clear that, whatever his gene ral policy might be, in Bahrain the building could be done by the Royal Air Force and that it was desirable that it should be done by the Royal Air Force. 4. Air Vice Marshal Collier informed me that the peak of their re-inforcement plan should see at least 2,000 aircraft passing through Bahrain every month, that this peak would be reached upon the collapse of Germany which he anticipated would take pl&amp;ee next year, but that these figures should not be used by me in any official correspondence as the Air Ministry was still somewhat hazy about their plans and he did not want to be quoted as having misrepresented them. 5. The two Air Vice Marshals approached me with regard to the B.O.A.U. W/T set as already indicated to you in my telegram Ho. 893 dated the 30th December 1943. ltd.

Air Ministry entirely share our views lr ’ ,JIS ! ' ! irom angle of post war civil aviation. Instructions are accordingly being is ued to Royal Air Force Headquarters that every elio^t should be made to carry out necessar vr constructional work for Americans in Bahrain and Sharjah ourselves at any rate so iar as immovable v/ork is concerned as opposed to technical install- ations e.g. radio or meteorological apparatus- which it would.be difiicult under the accepted arrangements referred to in Paragraph No.3 of Government of India's telegram No.11660 December 31st to prevent them from erecting themselves (in any case they alone are' technically competent to erect American type of apparatus). The existence of these arrangements provides reason why no comment was made on Royal Air Force’s action in giving permission to Americans to install radio ranges and beacons at Sharjah. Similar permission :; l? 8 lven ; '-t Tripoli, Benghazi, Cairo,Lydda, Habbaniyah-and Abadan. -ve agree however that this permission should not have been granted without previous reference to you and we had already made this point with Air Ministry who are drawing attention of Royal Air Force Headquarters to necessity for keeping you fully in the picture. As regards accommodation for ICC men this*'is'part of whole'scheme*now under consideration here. In considering these requests from Americans you will doubtless not overlook facts (a) that these facilities are requested in pursuance of large scale operational plans and take real urgency if arrangements are to be completed by local date of March 14th it is therefore impossi’ le to adopt anything in nature of an obstructive attitude._ All we can do is to insure that necessary facilities are provided in such a way as to prejudice our position in future as little as possible. (b) that as stated in my telegram No. 29583 the final decision on these requests must be given in London where we are in closest^ touch with the Air Ministry. While therefore Royal Air Force on the spot are naturally mainly concerned with operational aspebt of question ?_ nay not fully appreciate political issues involv ed though I trust you will continue to make every effort to explain position to them you may rest assured that this aspect of the matter will receive every attention here before final orders are issued. , 3 - . as regards paragraph No.2 of your telegram of Januarv 1st there is general agreement with view expressed by Government of* India telegram No. 11660 that wisest solution will be to bring Americans in under our wing in development of Arab Coast route and as stated above we hope that it will be found possible to carry out construction ourselves. We raised the question whether*if Americans /had &lt; ' T„ 2 had to he allowed to carry out construction on an agency basis for Royal Air x ,1 orce i - * would be possible for us to pay for this work 'ut Treasury saw 1 he gravest objections to this which would conflict with whole principle of lease lend arrangements. V/hile therefore agency basis should safeguard position in so far as relations with shaikh is concerned it would not prevent Americans from putting forward post war claim, to use! of facilities on ground that they had ijeen erected by American labour and paid for by American dollars if in spite of what is said in paragraph No.4'of Government of India telegram No. 11660 a general demand of this sort should c^me to be made. For this reason despite objections noted by Government of India,Headquarters Royal Air Force are being adked for their views on your suggestion to divert Americans to Persian coast route as a possible alternative should it prove impossible to execute construction work ourselves.

The use of the Causeway. b. The laying of the Pipe.Line. c. The installation of the requisite Storage Tanks. (All of which sites have been discussed with the Political Agent &amp; the Adviser). The only material required by the U.S.A.T.C. AUTHORITIES is the provision of the necessary pipe for the Bulk Refuelling Scheme.

FIHAX. It is suggested that the ultimate control of every phase of U.S.A.T.C. Operations is vested in the Station Commander Royal Air Force, Bahrain. It is in no way suggested or intended that local operational or Administrative control be effected, but matters concerning the running of the Royal Air Force Station, and Political matters in this area including with the Bahrain Government itself, should be placed through the Station Commander, R.A.F. Station, Bahrain. Consequent upon certain suggestions made above it will be necessary to approach the Bahrain Government officially, through H.B.M. r s Political Agent, for the leasing of small portions of ground, and to obtain permission for certain con structions.

The Company objects to the installation of oil^ storage tanks on Muharraq Island or elsewhere within the domains of His Highness The Shaikh of Bahrein unless such installations are the property of the Company or the Company has the option of purchasing same. The Company is willing to erect any tankage necessary for the use of the Royal Air Force at Muharraq and will endeavour to obtain the necessary materials, equipment and labour required.

With reference to the enquiry made by Mr. Grafton and yourself regarding the purchase or lease of a portion of the Company’s property adjacent to the jetty used by the B.O.A.C. in Manama. I have to advise that the Company Is not willing to sell or lease the Company property to your Company at this time. It was inferred from Mr. Grafton during the conversation that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited or the R&amp;fidain Oil Company Limited is contemplating constructing storage tanks and certain oil installations In Bahrein Islands for fuelling of flying boats. I have to advise in this connection that The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited has the exclusive right to construct and operate storage tanks in the Bahrein Islands. In view of this, the Company will protest the construction and operation of storage tanks in Bahrein Islands by your Company. This Company is prepared to erect storage tanks for the above purpose and to consider handling in them aviation gasoline shipped from Abadan dependent upon a satisfactory agreement being reached, until such time as aviation gasoline may be available from the Company’s refinery. I am not aware of the contemplated offtake of B.O.A.C. but believe the Company has suitable tanks available on the Island which could be installed in a short time.

On the 8th February the Bahrain Petroleum Company informed me that they desired to invoke Clause 4 of the Deed of Further Modification dated, the 19th June 1940 with regard to the erection of the Anglo Iranian Oil.Company petroleum storage tanks at Muharraq for the Ropal Air Force. Company proposed either: Marshal 7v 7 illock yesterday February 12th and discussed the position. Bowhil 1 who was very apprehensive of American penetration rejected alternative (c) immediately. Eventually it was decided that subject to confirmation by Middle East alternative (a) was the most satisfactory and at my suggestion he met the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company this morning and discussed details. I showed Bowhil 1 Clause 4 referred to in para graph No. 2, and told him I was telegraphing to you at once. Company's stand on Clause 4 was a domestic matter as between them selves and the Anglo Iranian Oil Company and was not inspired by Washington. The Company made it clear that they would do nothing to impede work essential for the war but must reserve their rights* postponed until after the war and tanker lorries used was between Sitra and Muharraq. As it has now been verified that the bridge in the causeway will take the weight this is satisfactory.

I was shown (a) the latest proposals for a ten mile pipe line (4* and o M ) from Sitra to Maharraq, with a short branch to th£ Marine Air port, as stated by Squadron Leader Chase in his Memorandum of the 51st January, (b) the proposed alignments of the ten mile route and -the seventeen mile route. Thereafter Squadron Leader Chase and myself had a discussion with Mr. Ward Anderson, General Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. I have also discussed the proposals with the Polly ticai Afaent, Bahrain. I have the following comments and observations to make. - A summary of recommendations is at tne end of this note - (a) No detailed expert survey of tnc ten mile route n~s yet been maae o*.nd tne x ! &lt;.;wU-^.t*j recoraaa on papv^r.

TUs.H FACTOR - In the above circumstances I am of the opinion that the line could not possibly be ready by the end of March 1944 5. CORROSION - The proposed ten mile line will be exposed to the active corrosive elements of soil, atmosphere and sea water ~ The scheme is admitted to be an interim one until proper pipe can be obtained - - The 3?aliineipipe for the submarine sections has been obtained from Qatar ; it is not new and may already be corroded - it should be examined and Mr. Ward Anderson undertook to arrange this - The 4” victaulic pipe is very thin, and should be expected to corrode in the Gulf more quickly thajb elsewhere - • 6. TEMPERATURE - There will be marked variations of temperature in the pipe and its contents due to- seasonal changes and the route v which passes along and under the ground, above and under the sea. This renders the line more liable to leakage and pull-outs - 'A« INHABITED LOCALITIES - There are grave objections to laying pipe lines, particularly white oil lines, through.towns and along streets due to danger toy fire to life and property for which compen sation would be demanded from His Majesty !3 Government. / The care*2 - 2 ~ jn The care and supervision of such a section of line is complicated and streets have to be dug up and corners negotiated. The pipe used should be as strong as possible, it is appreciated that risks have to be faced in war time. 8 . SUMMARY OF RECOMMEROuTIORS (a) Examine at once the causeway bridge with a view to deciding its reasonable war time carrying capacity - (British bridges are renowned for their ample factor of safety). The present civil engineer at Bahrain, Mr. Steele, • is an elec trical engineer and not competent to undertake tnis examination. (b) as a result of (a), earmark the requisite number of road tank lorries of suitable size ana determine their source. (c) Be prepared to supplement supply by road tankers by supply in drums. Mr. Ward Anderson is arranging to instal lorry and drum filling facilities at Sitra.. (d) Erect at once at Muharraq two 1000 barrel bolted tanks which are available ex P.D. stocks at Abadan. (e) Obtain from Port Sudan the two 5000 bolted tanks as these will be needed for other aviation spirit supply lines. (f) If it is decided to lay a line from Sitra to Muharraq as a permanent means of supply, carry out a detailed survey which should preferably avoid congested localities and - order the proper pipe, fittings, pumps, anti-corrosive wrapping etc., complete.

BritconsulCOPY. Air Headquarters, 'Iraq and Persia, Royal Air Force, Paiforce. 19th. March, 1 9AA. (4) hM Reference: §* 5198 /^. Sir, iave to 3?#for to the Meeting at your Offices on 15th March 1944 between representatives of your company and of the Royal Air Force to discuss the question of the transport of aviation fuel, property of the Royal Air Force, from the Air Ministry tank Ho 0 921 at Sitra to bulk tanks to be erected at Muharraq and delivery therefrom into refuellers. 2. I have to state that it is considered essential that the Royal Air Force should purchase outright the tanks to be erected at Huharraq and that such tanks should remain in Royal Air Force ownership for such period as they are required for operational purposes. Whilst this would preclude the land on which the tanks are to be erected at ifuharraq being sub-let to you or the tanks being repurchased by your Company as soon as they are erected at Muharraq,as previously suggested by your Company,it would not preclude your Company operating the tanks as agents of the Royal Air Force nor your Company being given the first option to repurchase the tanks if and Mien they are no longer required by the Royal Air Force. 3 . it is proposed that the two contracts should be placed with your Company, one covering the purchase from you of the two 2000 barrel tanks, including dismantling at your installation abd deliveiy to site at, Muharraq and any extra materials or work which it may be necessary f or you to supply or undertake in connection wijrh the re—erection of the tanks at the new site,and the second contract, covering the delivery of aviation fuel by road tank wagons from bulk tanks at Sitra and the operation and maintenance of the tanks at Muharraq. A separate communication is to be addressed to you as soon as possible in regard to the first contract referred to above relating to the purchase etc. of the tanks. A. As regards the proposed second contract referred to abobe, I am to confirm (1) That the Royal Air Force propose to provide 10 road tank wagons each of 1500 gallons capacity for the purpose of transporting the aviation fuel from the Air Ministry tank No.921 at Sitra to Muharraq. (2) That it is desired that you should provide civilian drivers for w these vehicles. At peak periods it would be necessary for the road tankers to operate up to 16 hours a day, which would probably render it necessary for sufficient drivers to be available for the^working of two shifts each of 8 hours during peak periods. ( 3 n , That major overhauls of the road tank wagons and spares on an exchange basis will be provided by the Royal Air Force, but it is des-ured that you'should undertake ordinary maintenance and running repairs,etc., to such vehicles. (4) During the period for which the road tank vehicles are loaned 'by the Royal Air Force, your Company would not be responsible for loss of or damage to the vehicles due to causes beyond the control of your Company, negligence or wilful misconduct of your Company or its servants causing loss of or damage or unfair wear and tear to any of the vehicles would not be deemed to be a cause beyond the control of your Company, You would be required to indemnify the Royal Air Force against any claims which may arise out of accidents or in respect of injury or damage which may be occasioned to any persons or property whilst the vehicles are under your control. At the end of the loan period, you wopH&amp;T be required to restore the vehicles to the Royal Air Force in good condition, fair wear and-tear excepted.P age No, 2_. (5) That it is desired that you should he responsible for the maintenance of the Royal Air Force tank installations to be erected at Muharraq, for receiving aviation fuel into those tanks, its custody therein and delivery therefrom into Royal Air Force refuellers. In this connection it is stated that charges for the supply of electric current in the new installation at Muharraq will be paid direct by the Royal Air Force to the Electric Supply Company and will not be charged to you. 5. Except in regard to price, etc., the conditions of Air Ministry contract No. 3.84966/024 dated 20th Februaiy, 1943 delating to the storage and delivery of the aviation fuel at your installation at Bahrein will be regarded as applicable also to the proposed new contract for the transport, storage and delivery of aviation fuel to and at Muharraq, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the terms of the new contract. It is proposed that the new contract should include provision for termination by the Royal Air Force giving one month’s notice in writing of their intention to terminate and for revision of charges after an initial period in respect of variations in rates for labour and materials. 6 . I am to state that in th event of your not being prepared to undertake as agents of the Royal Air Force the work of transporting the aviation fuel from Sitra and/or maintaining and operating the Royal Air Force bulk tank installations to be erected at Muharraq, it will be necessary, in view of the heed to conserve man-power in order to further the war effort, for the Royal Air Force to invite the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., Ltd. to act as agents of the Royal Air Force, in lieu of your Company, for such purposes. &lt;v 7. You are requested to acknowledge by return of post the receipt of this letter confirming whether you are prepared to undertake the work as outlined above and indicating the precise dates by which you will be in a position to forward to this Air Headquarters quotations for the work in question.

B.* h.4(c.^*)* Air Ministry* h.w.l.Minute by Srfcemal Department I saw Mr. G-ass, a Director of the A.I.O.C* , on Thursday 16 th Marcel# He explained that for a number of years his Company had been supplying B.O.A*C*( and its predecessor) with petrol on the air route along the Gulf. Hitherto petrol has been brought in from Abadan in tanks and drums and has been poured straight into bowsers on the aerodromes. With the increase in traffic however requirements are getting too big for this method to be maintained successfully and it is essential to be able to put up storage tanks. Until the point was raised recently by the Bahrain Petroleum Conpany his Coupsiay had no knowledge of the exclusive right of B.A.P. Go* to construct and supply oil storage tanks in Bahrein and he wanted to find out what thee position of his Company now was* Were they in effect now excluded from operating on behalf of the B.O.A.C. in Bahrein as they have been doing hitherto? I explained to Mr. Gass that the exclusive right to erect and operate oil storage tanks had been in B.A.P.Co.'s earlier agreements but had then only applied to a particular area. when in 1940 the Coup any obtained a further concession which gave them the whole of the f-heikh* s territories the exclusive right as to storage tanks was again included and this of course had the effect of giving them exclusive right over the whole of Bahrein. Mr* Gass enquired whether they also had the exclusive right to sell oil in Bahrein and I was able to assure him that paragraph 4 (c) of the Agreement specifically excluded any such right. I told Mr. Saas that as far as I could see although we had not yet had time to explore the position from its legal aspect, there was nothing in the .Agreement to prevent his Company from continuing to operate except that they could not erect storage tanks. Under the Civil Air Agreement, Article 11, H.M.G. have the right to supply petrol either direct or through their agents to users of the aerodrome, and if they chose to select A.

(a) By Article 11 of the Civil Air Agreement His Majesty*s Government had the implied right to erect storage tanks on the aerodrome. (fe) By Article 4(h) of the M Deed of Modification dated the 19th June 1940' the Bahrain Petroleum Company obtained the sole right to construct storage tanks within the Shaikh*s present and future dominions. The presump tion teeing that the Company desired to prevent any competitors from obtaining a foot-hold on the Islands . His Majesty's Government were cognisant of this agree ment as it was witnessed by the Political Agent Bahrain and as they raised no objection to Article 4(b) they would be held by implication to have acquiesed in its provisions. (c) Article 7 of the Political Agreement dated June 29th 1940 H debars the Bahrain Petroleum Company from using aerodromes for its operations. The object presumably being to prevent the aerodromes being encumbered with the paraphernalia of the oil business not to make it possible for a rival concern to operate. Therefore I consider that there is no reasonable doubt that the Bahrain Petroleum Company can rightly object to the erec tion and operation of storage tanks by His Majesty's Government or any agent acting on their behalf. frh Political Agent, Bahrain.0 &lt; \x \ Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, External Department, India Office.

There seems to be a general consensus of opinion that it is open to II.Ii.G. to erect any storape tanks that nay be necessary at R.A.F. aerodromes in Bahrein and also b nominate their apent to handle actual sup-lies. I note from para.10 of your letter that Air Min istry propose that A.I.0.0. should continue to carry out the refuelling of land planes at Bahrein, both on behalf of R.A.F. and 3.0 .a.C. usinp their ovn refuelling vehicles ard personnel for that purpose. May I take it that the same applies also to 3.O.A.C. sea olanes.? As regards the formal letters of appointrant of as agents, my own view is that they should be ■&gt; by Air Ministry and not by Ministry of* Fuel and Power. One final do int.

You object to . but I suggest that what the Bahrain 'Company have in mind is that they wish to have an option to repurchase such tanks'as they may provide themselves to R.A.F. 'This is more reasonable and it would not preclude R.A.F., if necessary, returning the original tanks and erecting new ones, though this would no ' doubt be wasteful.

View taken here however as to legal position is that Bahrain Petroleum company cannot properly contend this in respect of tahks ^ required either at Muharraq or Manamah and there is no doubt now D for consideration is best method intimating His Majesty*s Govern- rnent’s requirements as in paragraph two above to two companies and toake it clear to Bahrain Petroleum Company that His Majesty*s Government hold themselves legally free to erect and maintain their own station storage installations for receipt and issue of fuel to aircraft at these two stations.

G.S. 22257 Dear Peel, Ext. 3503/44 Air Ministry, London.S.W.I. 5th August, 1944. ¥ou will have seen the recent Bahrain telegrams between us and the A.O.C. ending with the A.O.C’s telegram Q. 531 of 29th July. These telegrams deal with the oil supply at Muharraq. At the same time Mr. Burkett is writing to you on the future arrangements for fuel storage and supply at Manama. In both cases we seem now to be faced with the necessity of telling the Bahrain Company that we hold ourselves legally free to erect and maintain our own station storage installations for the receipt and issue of fuel to the aircraft at these two air stations. The‘practical argument for this, as we see it in the Air Ministry, is set out in my letter of 5th April, and we believe also that this argument is legally sound. At the same time we contend, following your advice, that the Bahrain Company’s monopoly is directly related to the bulk pro duction and treatment of the oil, which means the supply to us, in bulk, at whatever point convenient to us to take bulk delivery. How do you suggest that we proceed.? Are v/e all satis fied that our case is good enough for us to assert it and tell the Bahrain Company definitely that this is our position and we mean to maintain it. Or would you like to have a further con ference first to establish our case finally and settle our’line of action.? If you agree that we should now go ahead, would you propose that the case should be intimated to the Companies in London. ? And by whom.? Or should it be notified to the Political Resident, for him to establish it locally with the Companies.* Or would you propose that the Political Resident should first inform the Shaikh and get his concurrence in the first instance. I am sending a copy of this to Berthoud. Sincerely yours. Sd/= J.S. Ross. R.T. Peel Esq., C.I.E India Office. P.S.

W.C.2 7th August 1944. Dear Peel, You are aware of the position which has arisen at Bahrain in connection with the proposal that the Anglo-Iranian Oil company should erect shore fuel storage tanks at Manama to enable them adequately to carry out, as agents of B.O.A.C, their responsibilities for refuelling R.A.F. and B.O.A.C. flying betas. We are satisfied that the present temporary expedient ol using a dumb barge is unsatisfactory. The present barge is 25/30 years old and was designed to carry non-dangerous oil products only. The type of construction is unsuitable for highly inflammable fuels, and particularly so in an opfcn sea anchorage. The barge has to be moored within a reasonable distance of the Hying boat alighting area and in this position it presents a serious fire hazard in view of the numerous native craft operating in that area. Furthermore, the excessive and rapid fouling of the hull will necessitate frequent decking, and unfortunately the... Pi’ioi ity demands in otner directions do not permit a replacement barge being made available. The present method of maintaining bulk fuel supplies atonT 1 -o??o iS - pr ^ Cari0US . i ? the , ext reme, and the only satisfactory solation is the provision of shore tanks as early as possible. Tankage for 50,000 gallons is required. j.here is however, an obstacle to the imuiediate urovision and^operation oy A»I.0.C. of shore tankage at Manama on account ol tne doubt as to the legal position vis-a-vis the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. The latter Company have already raised objections to an earlier proposal on these lines on the -•ItlfthP-hLih®? hwt exclusive rights under their agreement v*itu tiie shaikh to construct and operate storage tanks at Bahrain. .. . The legal position was explored in your minute of 18th , ^ as 'k k' ie India Office Legal' Adviserand his reply of 24th March. The legal opinion then offered was that the Bahrain i etroleum company Limited could not properly contend tnat tney would be entitled to prevent others from erecting and or e for :l the S use a |f H?SL° n th6 Sit6S in &lt; l uestion at the request • hov,ever 5 v,e canr '°t actually proceed with the installation on this assumption without first clearing the point locally. To do so would be to risk a clash of rival interests and in the long run might well mean a considerable loss of time. It seems to us that the next step would be for the India office on the strength of their legal opinion to take the matter up with the Political Agent at Bahrain, who might, if you agree, be asked to examine the position on the soot and to take a^l measures possible in consultation, if necessary, with the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited to enable the A.I.O.C as agents of B.O.A.C. to install the shore fuel tankage as soon as possible. lines. ,/e hope you will feel able to proceed along these Yours sincerely, Sd/- W.W.

I am commanded by the Air Council to say, for the information of your board, that they have under consideration the allocation of the agency work for the storage and distribution of aviation fuel at Muharraq. and Manama, in consultation with the other State Departments concerned, including the Ministry of Fuel and Power, 2. Your Company is aware that the Bahrein Asiatic Petroleum Company claim that they have the sole rights of constructing and operating storage tanks within the Dominions of the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Air Council do not admit the contention that these rights apply in the case of these two flying stations, and they will intimate this to the Company. 3. Their policy is to administer these flying stations as Air Ministry stations, utilising the services of either Company in an agenby capacity as may be expedient. In framing their scheme of allocation they have it in mind that the main supply of fuel will in due course be from the local Company’s refineries and not from Abadan. &lt; They have also had in mind the desirability of enabling A.I.O.C. to maintain their refuelling arrangements on Bahrein, which forms a link in a long chain of similar refuelling points. 4. In the case of Muharraq, they have already arranged with B.A.P.C.O. for the erection, operation and maintenance of the station tanks, while the arrangements for the refuelling of the aircraft will remain with your Compary as now. The Secretary, Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., Brittanic House, Finsbury Circus, E.C.2. 5./t * 5* In the cas$ of Manama, they contemplate that similar arrangements will be made, if and when it becomes necessary to provide a shore bulk installation for the needs of the aircraft using this flying base* t ' - A . . V»• . ’ . . 6. In both cases the Council expressly reserve the right to modify or change these arrangements in the interests of the service, at their sole discretion* 7* The Council have much appreciated the assistance afforded by your Compare in the past in regard to refuelling arrangements on the island of Bahrein* With this in mind they have in the present connection ^given weight to the interests of your Company to the maximum extent consistent with the general and Service interests. They hope therefore that your Company will accept the work of refuelling on the lines outlined abSve* At the^ same time they would be pleased to consider any suggestions of detail which you might care to offer* t . . ^ c:/ .

Allocation of contra«t services to rival Companies has been under consideration here in light of telegrams from yourself and from Political Resident in September. Para 2. B.A.I *C.O. claim legal monopoly of erection and operation of tanks. We do not admit this in respect of installations which are integral part of our air stations. Undesirable however to have this made the subject of Court case. General policy therefore is to utilise services of two Companies in agency capacity. At Muharraq B.A.P.C.O, will erect operate and maintain while A.I.O.C. will d o.refuelling of aircraft. Same arrangement intended at Manama if shore bulk installation is required in future. ' Para 3. This has been intimated formally to A .1 .0 .C .here . Desirable to await their reaction before you make similar intimation to B.A.P.C.O. at Bahrein. We will signal you further when we hear from A.I.O.C. Bara k* Meantime fuller particulars of our policy are being sent to you by air. This signal is simply to inform you what is being done here pending our final instructions. Para 5* probably undesirable at present for you to discuss merits of matter with Companies locally apart from receiving and forwarding any representations from them. Para 6.

I am sending copies also to the Foreign Office and India Office. 2 . For the most part it is a satisfactory acknowledgment of what we propose. Their concern otfer the continued 'security of tenancy of shore tankage' is presumably met by the fact that these tanks are our property and that we reserve the right with either Company to continue the proposed arrangements or to modify them in the light of experience. Further, it is obvious that the Bahrein company in carrying out their obligations 0 must maintain and operate these tanks to our satisfaction, and in full co-operation with A.I.O.C. , . 3. The letter, however, raises the much larger question of the future source of supply of oil. We gave them notice in our letter, on your behalf, that the future source of supply would be from Bahrein, and their letter is either a misunder standing of ours or an attempt to impress upon us that the efficiency of the refuelling services at these two points is dependent on supply by A.I.O.C. We did not, of course, mean refuelling in this sense, but the physical work of refuelling between tanks and aircraft. 4. May I take it that you ?/ill handle this direct with the Company in whatever way you think right, merely adding that as a matter of interest we would be glad to know your view on this and the action you take. 5 . We would like, as soon as possible, to telegraph instructions to the A.I.O.C. to take up with the Bahrein Company the arrangements sketched in our letter of the 29 th November to A.I.O.C. Have you any suggestion to make which would affect our draft telegram? You may have some matter arising out of the A.I.O.C's reply on which you would like us to take safe guarding action. 6 . I should add that I am of course sending a copy of this also to the Civil Aviation Department as they have a large interest in it for the post-war period. Sincerely yours, (Sgd) James Ross.

Finsbury Circus , London, E.C.2 Our ref s 39E your refj CS.2225?/s4(CS) 12 th December, 1944* The Under Secretary of state, Air Ministry, London, S.W.l. Sir, . We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th November , 1944* from which we have noted the desire of the Air Council in regard to the arrangements for the refuelling of air craft and storage of Aviation Fuel at the Muharraq and Manama flying stations on Bahrein Island to be undertaken by A.I.O.C, «- and B.A.P.Co. respectively. It would appear also from paragraph 3 of your letter that they contemplate that supplies of Aviation Fuel should be drawn in the main from B.AttP'CO^'s refinery at BahreIn. We are very gratified to receive the expression of appreciation of the Air Council for the refuelling work hitherto •performed at Bahrein by the A.I.O.C., and we shall be pleased to take v/hatever further part in the refuelling arrangements for the war effort there that may be allotted to us by the Air Council» In response to your invitation for suggestions of detail we have the following observations to offer }- Bulk storage is now an essential feature of any modern refuelling system if rapid and satisfactory delivery of substantial quantities is to be given. . without it, A.I.O.C. would be unable to maintain its refuelling service in Bahrein. Consequently although B.A.P.Co. have no sales monopoly in Bahrein, if their sole rights to erect and operate storage tanks were exercised to our detriment, they have in fact the means to shut out the A.I.O.C. unless K.M.G. provides storage for our use . No American or other interests suffer from a similar disability within those areas in the region of the Persian Gulf in which British Companies hold exploration rights. It is therefore of the utmost satisfaction to us to know that tbe Air Council have in mind the desirability of enabling A.I.O.C. to maintain their refuelling arrangements in Bahrein. If this is to be done, A.I.O.C. would require t (1) to be able to import Aviation Fuel in bulk into Bahrein fron Abadan after the war when normal conditions are restored; (2) security of tenancy of shore tankage for storage of Aviation Fuel supplied from either Abadan or Bahrein for delivery to Military and Civil aircraft. With regard to (1), we are quite aware that under wartime conditions of short haul it will be expedient to draw from the nearest source of Bahrein refinery. After the war, however, the /same Asame consideratices of tanker tonnage economy will no longer 'apply, and supplies brought in bulk by short sea passage from the nearby source of Abadan will clearly be competitive. Consequently vre submit that for the sake of an uninterrupted chain of supply on an Empire route and for other reasons of national security and economy it is highly desirable that A.I.O.C. should retain the position which they have had since the inception of British aviation ventures in the Persian Gulf, of being able to offer, if required, supplies of British controlled sterling oil to British and other aviation interests at Bahrein. With regard to the use of tankage provided by H.M.G., we shall be glad to know if the decision of the Air council to administer the two flying stations on Bahrein Island as Air Ministry stations will extend to the post-war period and will assure to the A.I.O.C, the continuity of use of tankage referred to in (2) above. we have already developed refuelling facilities at Bahrein for present and post-war air traffic at considerable cost, but we shall have at best a precarious hold and shall be unable to enter into supply contracts unless we are given security of tenancy of shore tankage. 'If, further, the Air Council were able to reconsider the allocation of duties at Manama and utilise the services of A.I.O.C. to operate and maintain the shore tankage there when erected as well as to refuel the air craft, it would in our view greatly facilitate the refuelling operations as a whole at the two points where A.I.O.C. is to be Entrusted with them and would ensure a smoother tran sition from war to post-war conditions.
